    "the two - fluid model as a phenomenological theory of superfluidity for he ii was a major conceptual breakthrough in quantum hydrodynamics since it gives an excellent account of the data in those cases to which the model is applicable , namely a spatially uniform fluid in a hilbert space , but it has long been known as an incomplete theory to describe many spatially inhomogeneous problems @xcite .    specifically , the remarkable hydrodynamic properties of he ii have been explained by the two - fluid model in which he ii is considered a mixture of two interpenetrating components : the superfluid with @xmath0 and the normal fluid with viscosity ; the two - fluid picture has been confirmed in an experiment with a torsion pendulum @xcite and also the theory predicted the correct energy spectra of collective excitations ( phonons and rotons ) below a @xmath1 point @xcite .",
    "however , it can not explain satisfactorily the peculiarly normal - fluid like behavior of the surface curvature of a rotating he ii to this date @xcite .    over half of a century",
    "the dynamics of quantized vortices have dominated the hydrodynamics of a superfluid . and",
    "yet , the mechanism , by which vortices are created and nucleated in a superfluid , is still poorly understood .",
    "in particular , the breakdown of superfluidity at the vortex core , which is closely related to the normal fluid - like behavior of the surface of a rotating he ii , has remained a mystery in low - temperature physics . in spite of the wealth of experimental data on the apparent breakdown of superfluidity @xcite ,",
    "the clue for this long - standing riddle has remained elusive . before proceeding to the explicit discussion of this problem , we mention some qualitative features of the two - fluid model by landau @xcite that is valid in a hilbert space . in the absence of an external field , there was no need to address the boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , the model assumes that the fluid can not actually separated into two parts ( superfluid and normal parts ) .",
    "this assumption is not in accord with mott s analysis on the surface energy due to velocity discontinuity of a superfluid @xcite .",
    "the presence of the surface energy implies that the particles in the layer are in excited states with finite energy gap from the ground state @xcite and behave like a normal fluid - breakdown of the two - fluid model .",
    "we will show this in more detail with explicit calculations on the surface waves in the surface layer .    a degenerate bose gas exhibits a peculiar condensation phenomenon that is now known as the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) which is often described as the momentum condensation ; this implies that the condensation is due to the symmetry of the wave function with respect to the interchange of any pair of particles in the degenerate bose system @xcite .",
    "the bec shows a remarkable feature that for @xmath2 the pressure of the condensed state is independent of density , where @xmath3 @xcite ; this is the consequence of the degenerate state of the bose particles with @xmath4 ( and @xmath5 ) .",
    "since all real gases are condensed differently by the presence of molecular forces , this mechanism appeared to be devoid of any real physical significance .",
    "the similar phase transition ( @xmath1-transition ) in liquid helium may be regarded as the condensation phenomenon of a degenerate bose - einstein gas modified by the presence of molecular forces .",
    "this was first recognized by london who has proposed that the transition between liquid he i and liquid he ii - @xmath1 transition - is the same process that causes the degenerate bose gas to condense . in support of london s",
    "view , feynman @xcite argued that , in a liquid - like quantum mechanical system , strongly interacting atoms behave in some respects very much like free particles .",
    "in other words , the strong interaction forces do not prevent these particles from behaving as if they are free particles .",
    "hence the inclusion of strong pair - interactions will not alter london s view on the @xmath1 transition as the same process that causes the condensation of an ideal bose - einstein gas , so long as there is a pair - interaction however weak the interaction might be @xcite .",
    "the work of london @xcite and the seminal paper by bogoliubov @xcite on a microscopic model of an imperfect bose gas have laid the basis for much of our theoretical understanding of liquid helium and the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "penrose and onsager have extended the concept of the bose - einstein condensation due to london @xcite to a strongly interacting bose system by introducing the concept of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) @xcite and suggested that superfluidity be described by the one particle ground state wave function @xmath6 which has a macroscopic mean value in the thermodynamic , quasi - equilibrium sense , the simplest example of which is an atomic bose - einstein condensation in a trap .",
    "thus the bose - einstein condensation in a trap can be defined by odlro @xcite .    in 1942 ,",
    "daunt and mendelssohn @xcite presented interesting experimental evidence for a striking similarity between the surface flow of he ii and the electric surface current in a superconductor , which goes much farther than a superficial similarity .",
    "they have noticed that in both cases there are upper limits for the current densities which depend on temperature .",
    "london studied a theoretical model to account for the similarity with the critical surface transfer rate @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density of superfluid particles per @xmath9 @xcite , but was not able to carry through due to the insufficient experimental data ; the measurements of daunt and mendelssohn with mobile helium films were the only data of which he could make use @xcite .",
    "he did , however , correctly point out the need to find a quantum mechanical mean field that represents the ground state of a many - particle system , and which can also describe the hydrodynamics of he ii .",
    "what s more , he emphasized that the peculiar low temperature transfer processes in both a superconductor and he ii should be explained on the basis of that familiar mixture of quantum statistics and classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "but up to now it has been customary to neglect the gravitational field in the study of quantum fluid for mathematical convenience , @xcite , which was justified by the extreme weak gravitational force compared to the pair - interaction force between he atoms .",
    "however , it is essential to include the external field in the discussion of a surface layer which is defined by the gravitational field and in which the two - fluid model of landau @xcite breaks down . in particular",
    ", the bec in a trap shows this peculiar shell - like structure @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the two - fluid model by landau @xcite can not explain the surface phenomena , since the two - fluid model does not allow a separation of the superfluid and normal parts of the he ii .",
    "more specifically , one of the problems we would like to address in this paper is to show that there is a striking similarity between the meissner effect @xcite in a superconductor in an external field and the surface phenomena in he ii in the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the question naturally arises what physical significance has to be given to this analogy .",
    "it will be shown here that the surface layer is composed of the excited atoms with the energy gap from the ground state @xcite and behaves like a normal fluid with viscosity .",
    "the particles in the layer do not interact with the bulk he ii . this separation under the gravitational field has been observed by lamb and nordsieck @xcite and supports mott s analysis @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been considerable interest in certain basic properties of the atomic bose condensation in connection with trapped alkali - metal gas at extreme low temperature @xcite . in a magnetic trap experiment , anderson _",
    "et al . , _ @xcite have observed a rapid narrowing of the velocity distribution and density profile of trapped @xmath10rb gas ( and also sodium atoms ) at low temperatures .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for a bose condensate in the trap .",
    "it would be , however , difficult to make any quantitative statement , based on first principles @xcite , about an actual realization of the bose - einstein condensation in a trap . before making such a dramatic claim",
    ", we must be sure that the data which appear to support the bec in a trap are consistent with the quantum many - body theory , that is , the data on the collective excitations must confirm a phonon spectrum as in henshaw and wood s experiment @xcite , since the ground state wave function is given by the mean field defined in odlro . in a curious circumstance ,",
    "this pertinent question @xcite was never taken seriously in the physics community @xcite .",
    "thus the preliminary study , for its final quantitative description , must wait for the correct theoretical analysis of a dynamical proof of the bec to confirm the realization of a bec in a trap . because the weak interaction between the atomic particles in the bec can be described by the hard sphere approximation as in bogoliubov s theory of superfluidity ,",
    "it is essential to demonstrate the bogoliubov s phonon spectrum @xmath11 @xcite in the the study of collective excitations in the bec .",
    "it is also the purpose of this paper to discuss a variety of additional conceptual details of the broken symmetry @xcite in an imperfect bose gas which completes the theory of the bose system .",
    "it is extremely challenging to carry out an experimental study of ( first ) sound wave propagation in a trap to confirm the presence of bec @xcite , because 1 ) the speed of sound wave @xmath12^{1/2}/m$ ] depends on both the local density ( and the wavelength of a traveling sound wave , which is @xmath13 ) ; 2 ) it is impossible to study the quantum effects of the bec by the de broglie wave @xmath14 of a particle in the trap whose wavelength is equal in order of magnitude to the macroscopic size of the trap as @xmath15 in condensation",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that , in liquid helium , the quantum effects become important when the de broglie wavelength @xmath14 corresponding to the thermal motion of atoms becomes comparable with the distances between atoms at about the @xmath1 point @xcite .",
    "the above discussion applies entirely to the atomic bose - einstein condensation in a trap and so remains valid in the liquid helium below the @xmath1-point as well @xcite .",
    "it will be shown , therefore , that an experimental confirmation of the bogoliubov spectrum of a spherical sound wave @xcite is both a necessary and a sufficient condition to observe the bose condensation in a trap .",
    "hence the study of collective excitations occupies a unique place in an interacting bose system @xcite . just as the phonons that mediate strong attractive electron - pair interactions in a superconductor brought about cooper pairs which obey bose statistics and become a superfluid by condensation - the super - conducting transition @xcite",
    ", a pair - interaction between bose particles which brings about @xmath1 transition in liquid helium also ensures that , in the absence of the long - range order interaction @xcite , the system possess certain certain collective excitations .",
    "more specifically , we study the collective excitations in a bec to probe the dynamics of interacting bose particles and thereby to provide a course of experiments to confirm the bec in a trap @xcite .",
    "hence this discussion is not merely a question of the mathematical technique to obtain a correct dispersion for a sound wave leading to the bogoliubov s phonon spectrum @xmath11 , but is the question of a scientific merit of the bose - einstein condensation in a trap @xcite .",
    "the present research was undertaken in the hope that a comprehensive investigation of phase - coherent collective excitations in he ii and the atomic bec in a trap would bring a unified picture to a number of long standing problems in low temperature physics based on first principles . a new perturbation method similar to that of feynman @xcite in concept but",
    "mathematically more precise technique @xcite , is developed in section iii to deal with the region of low energy excitation ( phonon ) in both he ii and bec in a trap where the conventional perturbation method of quantum field theory fails @xcite . along with the concept of odlro of penrose and onsager for",
    "both he ii and bec as a superfluid @xcite , a detailed mathematical analysis is carried out based on bohm s theory of quantum mechanics @xcite and the semi - classical perturbation method of the lagrangian displacement vectors that overcome a major stumbling block in a finite space problem in the study of a quantum fluid @xcite .",
    "since the mathematical development is fairly complex and involves the various types of lengthy algebras for each point in the development of the theory , we wish to outline the rational behind the theory , leaving the detailed algebras to later sections .    at low temperature ( @xmath16 ) , bogoliubov s theory of superfluidity gives the dispersion relation for the collective excitations of quasi - particles in the form of @xmath17 in the long wavelength limit ( a longitudinal sound wave ) , where @xmath18^{1/2}/m$ ] and k is the wave number @xcite .",
    "however , bogoliubov assumed in his derivation of the dispersion relation for a phonon that the bose quantum fluid is homogenous as well as isotropic , and of unlimited extent - of a hilbert space .    in order to incorporate a well - known theorem ( goldstone ) in quantum field theory into our study of an imperfect bose gas at low temperature , we review its implications in a many - body system of bosons .",
    "the theorem states : the spontaneously broken gauge symmetry in a nuclear many - body system always accompanies a longitudinal phonon , that is , a zero - mass , zero - spin nambu - goldstone boson ( or the goldstone mode of symmetry in quantum field theory ) @xcite .",
    "the reason why the spontaneously broken symmetry may play a fundamental role is due in part to its practical usefulness as a basic mechanism by which we can explain the apparent breakdown of superfluidity at a nodal surface for a study of surface phenomena in both he ii and bec @xcite , for which a standard perturbation method fails due to the singularity in the mean field .",
    "a proper treatment of the boundary conditions is especially important in a finite space problem ; we have developed the method that replaces the physical surface by boundary conditions from which we can separate the surface layer from the bulk fluids by introducing the lagrangian displacement vectors @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have established the similarities between the meissner effect in a superconductor in an external field and the characteristics of the surface layer in he ii under the gravitational field . in fact",
    "a dominant feature of the similarities is so striking that it is quite reasonable to inquire whether the goldstone theorem can be equally applied to the imperfect bose system .",
    "it will be shown , with a specific example , that the broken symmetry is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for the conservation of energy in an isolated bose system .",
    "thus the spontaneously broken symmetry in a bose quantum fluid is a fundamental phenomenon that may explain the peculiar normal fluid - like behavior of the surface layer of a rotating he ii under the gravitational field ; similarly it can also explain the breakdown of superfluidity at a vortex core .",
    "this peculiar behavior of a surface layer of a rotating he ii has troubled the intuition of many experimental physicists since the its first observation by osborne in 1950 @xcite .",
    "the new bec in a trap is a small droplet with tens of microns in radius and has a low density , that is to say , the mean particle density @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an @xmath22 wave scattering length .",
    "thus we can adequately describe the pair - interaction by the hard sphere approximation .",
    "a simplest procedure we take is to assume the realization of bec in a trap and inquire how we may prove it . of course",
    ", one may try to confirm a phonon spectrum in experiments as shown in bogoliubov s theory of superfluid @xcite .",
    "there are numerous papers on the theories of a bose quantum fluid @xcite ; they are , however , developed for a spatially uniform bose system in a hilbert space for mathematical convenience . but",
    "anyone who is familiar with modern quantum field theories @xcite should see at once that the conventional perturbation theories based on the field theories ( _ i.e. , _ the pair interactions through a quantized field ) may fail entirely in our problem of atomic bec in a trap .    in a finite ,",
    "spatially , inhomogeneous many - body system , it was demonstrated @xcite that the most serious difficulty of applying these theories is that the broken symmetry at the nodal surface yields a new set of dispersion relations for the collective excitations , so that the picture of the collective excitations in the previous theories @xcite is significantly altered due to the presence of a nodal surface . similarly , the boundary conditions play a peculiar but a decisive role in a finite space problem . both for this reason , and",
    "because the quantum field theoretic ( microscopic ) approach can not be applied to a spatially inhomogeneous problem with a boundary @xcite , it is therefore essential to find _ a new mathematical method _ by which we may implement the necessary boundary conditions that are consistent with the modified two - fluid model of landau @xcite .",
    "this is most simply carried out by introducing the semi - classical perturbation method of lagrangian displacement vectors @xcite .",
    "our discussion of these problems is based on the following physical picture : an incompressible surface excitation involves a breakup of phase coherence over the surface of bec droplet , whereas longitudinal excitations , however , such as those generated by compression , do not break up the phase coherence in a superfluid and yield the bogoliubov spectrum for a phonon .",
    "thus the longitudinal and surface excitations in turn identify the type of fluids that support these excitations .",
    "the surface waves are essentially transverse in nature . in addition to the usual surface waves",
    ", we will show that , in the surface layer , there is also a transverse wave that is driven by entropy change in the layer , which is different from that of temperature waves ( second sound ) @xcite .",
    "one of the essential new steps in our study of the broken symmetry is to adopt mott s suggestion @xcite on the extension of the two - fluid model of landau @xcite .",
    "based on london s interpretation of the @xmath1-transition @xcite and the explanation of energy gap by bijl , et al . ,",
    "@xcite , mott suggested that , to describe the behavior of helium in rollin films and to derive the critical velocity of a superfluid flow in a capillary , it is necessary to extend the two - fluid model by identifying the superfluid with the atoms in the ground state and the normal fluid with the atoms in the excited states with a finite energy gap ( see figs . 3 , 5 and 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . particularly remarkable , however , is the anticipation of the onsager - feynman quantization of superfluid velocity in a rotating he ii as a mechanism to give rise the surface energy by velocity discontinuity @xcite .",
    "thus we here define the normal fluid as composed of phonons ( and rotons ) and the excited atoms with finite energy gap from the ground state as _ an extended two - fluid model of landau _ @xcite .",
    "it will be shown in this paper that the above characteristic difference between the two waves ( the sound wave and the surface wave ) provides the reason why the spontaneously broken symmetry must take place at the nodal surface - a breakdown of superfluidity .",
    "a proof of the broken symmetry lies at the core of many of unresolved problems in low temperature physics , especially since there is convincing evidence for the break - down of superfluidity at the free surface of rotating he ii .",
    "perhaps a more fundamental explanation for the broken symmetry in he ii is that one can not hold the law of conservation of energy in a finite , isolated system by dissipation process unless the symmetry is spontaneously broken at the nodal surface .",
    "this is because a phonon can not interact with a superfluid component , but with the aid of mott s extension of the two - fluid model @xcite , it does , however , interact with a normal fluid , giving rise to a surface energy - a capillary wave by the surface tension .",
    "the above discussion is by no means a complete answer to the surface layer problem . by the well - known arguments of spontaneously broken symmetries @xcite",
    ", this peculiarly universal behavior of a surface layer of a superfluid in a gravitational field can not be explained by the goldstone theorem alone , since the degree of broken symmetry depends on the curvature of the free surface and the energy of a superfluid in the system .",
    "for example , the breakdown of superfluidity at the vortex core accompanies a roton whose effective mass is @xmath23 ( a pseudo - goldstone boson ) @xcite but not a massless phonon ( a goldstone boson ) .",
    "since the non - trivial irreducible linear representation of the group @xmath24 is a real two - vector @xmath25 , we write the ground state function in odlro as @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the action and is a solution of the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite . following anderson @xcite",
    "we also interpret the particle field operator @xmath28 as our definition of a superfluid which has a macroscopic mean value @xmath29 $ ] with a definite phase @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "thus the collective excitations ( a gravity wave , a phonon , and a roton ) and bohm s quantum theory @xcite are essential for a complete understanding of properties of a superfluid in a gravitational field , particularly its interaction with the gravitational field and the spontaneously broken symmetry at the nodal surface .",
    "we proceed further in two stages : we first derive collective excitations in a spherically symmetric bec droplet to show the reason why the hidden symmetry is broken on the nodal surface of the bec in a trap - a shell - like structure and then extend the calculations to he ii . in the second stage of calculation",
    ", we discuss the mechanism by which the symmetry is broken by fluctuation - dissipation in terms of the action and the effective quantum mechanical potential @xcite .    with the spontaneously broken symmetry",
    ", i will then discuss the three outstanding problems : a ) a breakdown of superfluidity at the vortex core in he ii for which there is still no proven mechanism that explains the breakdown in superfluidity at the core @xcite , and also resolves a long - standing controversy over the form of the magnus force that has troubled many theoreticians @xcite since the first experiment on a vortex quantization by vinen in 1961 @xcite ; b ) we discuss the onsager - feynman quantization of circulation in he ii which is an extension of the bohr - sommerfeld condition in phase - space for which we show the identifiable direct cause for it to take place in he ii with planck s quantum condition ; c ) a longstanding riddle on the curvature of a rotating he ii under the gravitational field - the theoretical curvature based on landau s two - fluid model is incompatible with that of observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of broken symmetries confined , as it is in both cases , to the geometrical surface , might be explained by the fact that the particles in the surface layer ( normal fluid ) are free from from the interaction with the bulk superfluid , they can be accelerated only by external forces . with these qualitative remarks as an introduction , we proceed to the development of phenomenological theory of a quantum bose liquid .",
    "the broken symmetries in a superconductor have been studied extensively since the remarkable discovery of josephson junctions @xcite . and yet there is no systematic study of the broken symmetry in he ii and an imperfect bose gas in a trap ( bec ) to date .",
    "moreover , there is actually a fundamental difference between the ways in which the broken symmetry is realized in a superconductor and in a bose quantum fluid ( he ii and bec ) .",
    "the problem is then to define in a mathematically precise way the broken symmetries in an interacting bose system in which both the law of conservation of energy and the number density must be preserved .    the basic idea of spontaneously broken symmetry in a superfluid",
    "can be explained by the goldstone theorem alone @xcite .",
    "the physical principles underlying mathematical analysis in the derivation of the goldstone theorem are so clear that it is easy to see how the theorem can be applied to a number of problems in low temperature physics . however , we would first study the broken symmetry with the dynamical calculations based on the ground state wave function defined in odlro @xcite and bohm s quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the fist step is therefore to define the odlro and thereby the ground state wave function - mean field . for this purpose",
    "we follow anderson s analysis @xcite .",
    "the idea of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) by penrose and onsager @xcite may be stated precisely as the following : the superfluidity be described as a state in which the reduced density matrix of the condensed bose system can be factorized , @xmath31 where @xmath32 as @xmath33 . here the single particle wave function @xmath34 represents a bose condensed ground state wave function in odlro and describes a superfluid in terms of the single particle wave function .",
    "we take @xmath34 as the mean value of the quantum particle field or simply the mean field and consider it as the definition of a superfluid in this paper @xcite .",
    "more important is the requirement that the wave function be single valued in this measurable part of the density matrix is what leads to the quantization of vorticity in he ii .    with the the hard sphere approximation for the repulsive pair interactions for bose particles @xcite",
    ", one can show that the ground state wave function satisfies the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gross - pitaevskii ) in the self - consistent hartree approximation @xcite , @xmath35 \\psi,\\\\ \\label{cat2}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath21 is an s - wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "( [ cat2 ] ) is a self - consistent hartree equation for the bose condensed wave function .",
    "it should be emphasized that the nonlinear term @xmath37 is invariant under a @xmath24 group transformation .",
    "the lagrangian from which we can derive eq .",
    "( [ cat2 ] ) is therefore invariant under the @xmath24 group provided that @xmath38 is invariant , which we assume to be the case [ see also eq .",
    "it is also well worth to point out that we can still apply bohm s interpretation of quantum theory to eq .",
    "( [ cat2 ] ) with the understanding that the self - interacting term be a part of the potential defined in his quantum theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear term in the nonlinear schrdinger equation is responsible for an emission of a phonon in a bose liquid just like the nonlinear maxwell equations describe a photon emission @xcite .",
    "since the mathematical analysis of the quantum phenomena with the ground state bounded by a free surface presents much greater difficulties due to a inhomogeneous spatial density , the question naturally arises : what is the critical parameter that can assure us a semi - classical mathematical method as an adequate perturbation method within given limits of accuracy ?",
    "the answer to this question is obviously plank s constant @xmath39 , since quantum effects become important as the temperature of the system approaches to absolute zero and thus the pair - interaction potential is calculated by the hard - sphere approximation . in the classical limit ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the action @xmath41 is a solution of of the hamilton - jacobi equation as is shown below .",
    "this implies that if a solution is independent of @xmath39 , it is then a classical part of the solution .",
    "thus @xmath39 gives the fundamental difference between a normal fluid and a superfluid , since the pair - interaction , which is derived from a hard sphere approximation @xcite , brings about the @xmath1 transition in liquid helium as in a superconductor ( _ i.e. , _ cooper pairs ) .",
    "we also notice that the dispersion relation for the collective excitations in a superfluid is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath42 is speed of ( first ) sound @xmath43^{1/2}/m$ ] and @xmath44 is the wave number in the phonon regime in he ii ( @xmath16 ) . in order to understand what is involved in such an analysis",
    ", we first consider the problem of collective excitations in an atomic bec in a trap and derive the bogoliubov spectrum to show that the perturbation method is indeed correct to the first - order .",
    "thus the whole problem of superfluid dynamics depends on the physical meaning that is ascribed to the particle field operator @xmath6 in the equation eq .",
    "( [ odlro ] ) as the macroscopic mean value in a bose system .",
    "let us now take up the main problem of superfluid dynamics and ask the question of how to apply the mean field @xmath6 to the solution of the broken symmetry in he ii .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that @xmath6 is also a complex order - disorder parameter in the sense of landau @xcite .",
    "the first step is , therefore , to express the wave function in terms of an action and amplitude that yield the equations of motion which are consistent with the modified two - fluid model of landau @xcite .",
    "the action satisfies the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation that gives an explanation for a spontaneously broken symmetry in the bec in a trap .",
    "this is precisely the reason why we adopt bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite in our study .",
    "the basic ideas we apply in our discussion is best understood in terms of a more familiar example .",
    "we thus begin our discussion by recapitulating the basic concepts of bohm s quantum theory .",
    "the bohm s interpretation of the quantum theory is based on the three special assumptions :    \\a ) the single particle field @xmath6 satisfies schrdinger s equation ;    \\b ) if we write @xmath26 $ ] , then the particle momentum is restricted to @xmath45 in the classical limit ( @xmath40 ) ;    \\c ) we have a statistical ensemble of particle positions , with the probability , @xmath46 .",
    "plank s constant @xmath47erg sec here plays a critical role in our entire discussion on he ii and the bec ; the transition from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics can be formally described as a passage to the limit @xmath48 for which the effective quantum mechanical potential becomes @xmath49 ( see below ) .",
    "as discussed above , we have modified the first assumption by including the nonlinear term for the pair - interaction of bose particles , but it is still invariant under the @xmath24 group transformation and becomes a part of the potential in the wave equation . thus the wave field @xmath6 satisfies a schrdinger equation eq .",
    "( [ cat2 ] ) with the nonlinear interaction term ( or simply the nonlinear schrdinger equation ) . by deriving the well - known bogolibov spectrum in quantum liquids @xcite from the nonlinear schrdinger equation ,",
    "we demonstrate that our modification of the bohm s quantum theory does not affect his interpretation .",
    "the essential point is to write the wave function in the form @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is an action and @xmath50 may be interpreted as a number density for a system of @xmath51 bose particles @xcite . in the quantum many - body theory @xcite , @xmath28 has been interpreted as a complex order parameter ; it has both an amplitude @xmath52 and a phase @xmath53 which is coupled to external forces , whereas @xmath52 is merely an internal order parameter in the sense of landau s order parameter of the systems @xcite .",
    "thus bohm s quantum theory does not create any difficulty in the conventional many - body theory and can be viewed as an extension of it @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be emphasized that bohm s quantum theory is essentially equivalent to feynman s space - time approach to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "bohm s approach is , however , better suited especially to boundary value problems , because the action @xmath27 satisfies the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation ( qhje ) exhibiting the broken symmetry by the effective quantum mechanical potential at the nodal surface in the limit @xmath40 , whereas @xmath50 satisfies the equation of continuity from which we can derive boundary conditions at the nodal surface @xcite .",

    "in addition , feynman has pointed out that a density fluctuation satisfies the conservation of number density : when the density is increased by compression in one part of the system , it is decreased by rarefaction in the other part of the system .",

    "much of the similarities between the surface phenomena in he ii and the meissner effect in a superconductor has been due to the london equations for the meissner effect in terms of the classical magnetohydrodynamics , ( @xmath437 and @xmath438 . if we set @xmath439 , the london equations are essentially equivalent to our boundary conditions ( @xmath179 and @xmath172 ) with the gravitational acceleration @xmath440 @xcite along with bohm s second assumption @xmath88 which implies @xmath441 for a free surface of he ii in the absence of gravitational field @xcite",

    "the similarity is indeed remarkable .",
    "it is this critical observation of the surface phenomena in he ii that led us to study the broken symmetries .",

    "since the ground state wave function in odlro can be written as @xmath26 $ ] @xcite , we may interpret the broken symmetry of the ground state wave function at the nodal surface , the point at which @xmath27 must satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions by which we have demonstrated in section iv that a degenerate bose system in an external field exhibits the second - order phase transition at the nodal surface - a normal fluid with the surface energy onto a superfluid just as the meissner effect in a superconductor in an external magnetic field , _",

    "it is also well - known that a lattice possesses a translational symmetry , _ i.e. , _ invariant under @xmath24 transformation and that the symmetry can be broken by dislocation @xcite . in this sense the spontaneously broken symmetry in he ii is similar to what a lattice breaks the translational symmetry by dislocation or by impurity - a broken @xmath24 lattice gauge @xcite , since the bose particles in he ii are charge neutral which can be described by the global symmetry without a local gauge field like fermions .",

    "another approach to the study of broken symmetry is to ask a question whether the mean - field approach can explain the spontaneously broken symmetry at the nodal surface in he ii based on bohm s interpretation of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the affirmative answer to the question is essential to the basic argument of this paper .",
    "here we discuss the broken symmetry based on the following picture : he ii is described by the mean field @xmath28 in odlro and has the hidden symmetry which is given in terms of the action @xmath27 .",

    "thus the spontaneously broken symmetry can be readily explained by bohm s quantum theory and the mean field defined in odlro .",
    "an important step in our argument is based on the phase - coherence of the collective excitations in odlro . since the phase - coherence , @xmath402 , is a necessary condition for a superfluid to exist , if it is broken due to the quantum fluctuation @xcite at the nodal surface where @xmath450 is discontinuous and the effective quantum mechanical potential eq .",
    "( [ eqmp ] ) drives particles to fluctuate rapidly at the nodal surface of he ii , thus the fluid is no longer a superfluid due to breakdown of the phase - coherence at the surface where the boundary conditions play an important role just as the london equations for the meissner effect in a superconductor . on the other hand , we note that , inside of he ii away from the surface layer where the boundary conditions are unimportant , the action @xmath27 is analytic and the longitudinal sound waves remain phase coherent @xcite .    if , for the purpose of illustration , we assume that a superfluid droplet , which is suspended by an external force and in which the symmetry is not broken , and that a sound wave was initiated adiabatically at the center of the droplet , then the phonons must bounce back to the center .",
    "hence we see immediately that we can not maintain _ the law of conservation of energy _ in an isolated system @xcite , because the sound wave initiated at the center of a superfluid droplet can not be dissipated at the surface layer . however ,",
    "if the symmetry is broken , the sound wave dissipates by the interaction with the normal fluid at the surface layer , which would give rise a surface energy manifested by a surface tension - eq .",
    "( [ singh2 ] ) .",
    "this is because acoustic phonons , which possess many attributes of particle , can not interact with a superfluid component , as mott emphasized in his study of the two - fluid model @xcite , it does , however , interact with a normal fluid , giving rise to a surface energy manifested by the capillary wave eq .",
    "( [ capillary2 ] ) .",
    "this dissipation process of the sound wave is the same as in the case of the bec in a trap .",
    "it should be made clear that _ this gedanken experiment _ of ( first ) sound wave propagation in a superfluid droplet described above is different from the experimental study of the propagation of second sound by hall and vinen @xcite . in the simple example described above",

    "it is obvious that the above discussion is not a standard method to describe a dissipation process . in this",

    "the dissipation process of sound waves in the surface layer of he ii is essentially similar to that of luttinger s model of thermal transport coefficients of a superconductor @xcite , since his derivation of transport coefficients are appropriate to a normal conductor .",
    "thus there is a discontinuity in the free energy which leads to the second - order phase transition ( _ i.e. , _ a superconductor transforms to a normal metal ) .    in a simple system of a charged boson gas as a superconductor in equilibrium ,",

    "rayfield has proposed a mechanism @xcite by which a vortex - ring is being formed in he ii with ion probes at the center and which overcomes a logical inconsistency in the previous work @xcite .    more specifically the new experimental data indicate that `` _ the vortex lines associated with the formation of the vortex - ring is slowly peeled away from the ion complex in the form of a steadily growing loop as the electric field increased _ '' .",
    "this picture explains why the ion complex is not required to hop into the ring and there was no discontinuous change in the drift velocity after the ion reaches a critical velocity .",
    "thus the peeling out of vortex line begins when the velocity field of the superfluid in the neighborhood @xmath466 ( see fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) . if the process is completed at the ion - critical velocity , the discontinuity results in the curve of velocity vs electric field which shows a spontaneous symmetry breaking in he ii @xcite .    based on the concept of anderson s phase slippage @xcite",
    ", this process can be described more precisely by @xmath467 phase slip of a vortex line at the inner surface of the macroscopic vortex - ring and the momentum exchange as the ion cluster begins to slow down , since the microscopic vortex line attached to the ion complex can be detached through the interaction with the macroscopic vortex - ring at its inner surface . as emphasized by rayfield @xcite",
    ", it is a difficult task to obtain the dispersion relation for the ion - vortex - ring experimentally , for the velocity field is a superposition of the flow field of ion and vortex - ring .",
    "as will be shown below , the vortex - ring formation is very similar to that of a parabolic surface of a rotating he ii .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that we have applied a spontaneously broken symmetry as a mechanism to explain the breakdown of superfluidity at the vortex core instead of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations which were applied to the study of the energy gap parameter @xmath445 to explain the breakdown of superconductivity in the abrikosov vortex line @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the bogoliubov equations are valid in a hilbert space , but not to a problem with a boundary , because they are derived for a uniform system @xcite .",

    ", @xcite pointed out that _ there are many , conflicting results in the literature , as many as there are theorists active in the field_. perhaps it is not surprising that there should have been such a diverse disagreement , for the landau s two - fluid model was confirmed in an experiment by andronikashvili @xcite and was never before suspected for its breakdown at the nodal surface , although there was clear experimental evidence for the break - down of superfluidity in a rotating he ii as early as 1950 in osborne s experiment @xcite .    out of such seemingly hopeless confusion that has plagued our intuition since the first experiment by vinen @xcite , a systematic study of thouless group over the years has brought the question of a correct form of the magnus force as a major stumbling block in our understanding of dissipation processes in he ii . but a general consensus on the form of magnus force is still lacking , because there has been no convincing theoretical analysis to date .",
    "the failure of strenuous efforts by thouless group led us to speculate at first that some novel concept is lurking behind this pervasive confusion over the half century @xcite .",
    "yet there is one outstanding a hint in the way of accepting any of those previous theories : the crux of controversy on the form of the magnus force is the very simple observation that we have no experimental evidence for the presence of a superfluid component at the vortex core and the data are always analyzed based on _ the classical form of the magnus force _ @xcite .",
    "the current state on the magnus force reminds us the @xmath487 puzzle in nuclear physics that led the discovery of the parity non - conservation in the @xmath455 decay in particle physics by lee and yang in the 1956 @xcite .",
    "indeed the most significant consequence of the spontaneously broken symmetry is that we adapt the classical form of the magnus force , since the two - fluid model breaks down at the nodal surface .",
    "thus the core of charged vortex ring may be regarded as a charged thin ring made of a normal fluid ( _ i.e. , _ a smoke ring with an ion probe ) that satisfies the equation of motion for a uniform motion :    @xmath488    where @xmath489 is the force by the applied electric field , and @xmath490 is the hydrodynamic magnus force per unit length , where @xmath148 is the density of a normal fluid . here",

    "the reason why this controversy has persisted for so long may be traced to our failure to recognize the broken symmetry at the nodal surface and to take account the fluctuations of particle orbits ( _ i.e. , _ a break down of superfluidity by the breaking up the phase - coherence ) driven by the fluctuating eqmp with decreasing radius of a curvature of the free surface at the core @xcite . it also explains why vinen s experimental data @xcite are essentially correct , which was obtained by the classical form of the magnus force .",

    "we refer the reader ref .",
    "@xcite for details of feynman s criteria @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above models , lin @xcite suggested that the superfluid might have a small viscosity and would thus reach a steady state of uniform rotation in which boundary slip would cause the superfluid component to rotate more slowly than the normal fluid at low velocities .",
    "lin s insight into the question of whether the superfluid component rotates was quite plausible , but it was difficult to explain the experimental observation by reppy and lane @xcite that a container of he ii can be rotated at a higher speed in the absence of the superfluid motion . moreover",
    "the notion of the boundary slip is incompatible with the two - fluid model of landau .",
    "in particular , the superfluid component in a uniform motion must remain inviscid and irrotational @xmath84 , but it can be singular only at isolated points of a rotating he ii , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath507 at discrete points of the superfluid in motion , at which the broken symmetry takes place to create vortices @xcite .",
    "to meservey @xcite who has carried out the same experiment on a rotating he ii as osborne s @xcite and whose incisive comments on the previous theoretical models @xcite based the his data , and to mott @xcite whose remarkable insights into the surface energy due to velocity discontinuity with which the present concept of broken symmetry has been deduced with mathematical rigor , we owe them for their valuable insights into the surface phenomena in he ii .    in 1964 , meservey @xcite concluded that neither the simple vortex line model @xcite , nor the vortex sheet model @xcite is adequate to explain all of his data .",
    "in addition , reppy and lane @xcite also pointed out that there is no reasonable mechanism by which the vortex line model can be realized in actual experiments , since the macroscopic turbulence in the superfluid has been observed in a rotating he ii which implies the vortex lines were unstable long before the rotating he ii reached a steady state @xcite .",
    "in fact so random is the upward motion of vortices , diffusion of vortex - lines - that is , short smoke ring like objects , but they are much longer in length than those of rotons - that the vorticity of the system has been evolved into an infinite number of patterns which can be described only by a homogeneous turbulence in he ii @xcite .",
    "thus the experimental support for feynman s vortex line model @xcite is doomed to failure ; the unusual argument for a stable vortex line model leads to counterintuitive results that can not still describe the shape of curvature of a rotating he ii , since a vortex line is absolutely unstable to the @xmath508 hose mode @xcite .",
    "meservey s @xcite argument for the role of a surface free energy associated with velocity discontinuities suggested by mott @xcite is quite plausible , yet they can not still explain why the curvature of the surface of rotating he ii is temperature independent and the free surface does rotate .",
    "this is the principal difficulty of the vortex - nucleation model in a superfluid : at no point can one really exclude the second order phase - transition in order parameter , in view of the break - down of the phase coherence due to fluctuation - dissipation at the free surface .",
    "also , of course , it is precisely the nature of a superfluid that it can not have a steady state under a gravitational field whether it is in motion or at rest @xcite , but it can have a steady state with a free surface on which the two - fluid model breaks down as shown in section iii .",
    "we have already seen in section iv that , in the dynamical study of the bec in trap , from which we have discovered a shell - like structure of the bec in an external field , it was necessary to introduce the chemical potential as an undetermined lagrangian multiplier to maintain the equilibrium state of an imperfect bose gas in an external potential [ see eq .",
    "( [ motion0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqs0 ] ) ] .",
    "this study of the bec in a trap has led us to study the spontaneously broken symmetry to explain the shell - like structure .    with the spontaneously broken symmetry , which takes place only locally at the free surface and is purely topological in nature , and anderson s @xmath467 phase slippage of vortices at the free surface @xcite , it is straightforward to derive the contour of a free surface of a rotating he ii @xcite , @xmath509 since no superfluid component is present at the surface layer @xcite .    for the simplest dissipation case ,",
    "let us consider a small bundle of @xmath8 vortices which are created at the bottom of rotating cylinder and move upward like micro - bubbles in a beer can .",
    "the bundle moves upward in a complicated manner , perhaps undergoing a few twists and reconnections @xcite before finally being nucleated at the free surface by the phase slippage , imparting the angular momentum to the surface .",
    "this will lead to a @xmath510 phase slip and the energy dissipated at the surface will be @xmath8 times greater than the @xmath467-event .",
    "hence the surface rotates and reaches a steady state with the angular velocity @xmath506 after awhile @xcite . here the free surface being a normal fluid plays a role similar to that of a wall in anderson s model - that is , nucleation of vortices by a @xmath510 phase slippage @xcite .",
    "hence the curvature must remain temperature independent , which is consistent with the extended two - fluid model of landau @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the above picture of how a parabolic free surface is formed in a rotating he ii is similar , in many respects , to that of formation of a vortex - ring by an ion complex in he ii @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath467 phase slip is indeed a basic concept that applies to a number of problems including the motion of a vortex in an orifice @xcite . in accordance with the broken symmetry , not only",
    "should we able to resolve the recent controversy over the magnus force @xcite , but also explain how the superfluidity breaks down at the core of a vortex line @xcite .    with the detailed dynamical calculations in terms of the action of the mean - field defined in odlro @xcite , we have been able to explain a number of problems that have been profoundly puzzling over the last half century @xcite , such as the curvature of a rotating he ii and the breakdown of superfluidity at a vortex core in he ii @xcite .",
    "before we close this discussion on the rotating he ii , one more comment on a recent paper @xcite is in order : based on the notion of a regauged space translation , su and suzuki have shown a new derivation of the quantization of a vortex - line , and have shown the similarity between the main characteristic of the surface layer of a rotating he ii and the meissner effect in a superconductor @xcite .",
    "when a particle displacement is introduced into the bose system , it invariably perturbs the particle density of the system .",
    "moreover , the gauge field is a dynamical variable which must be analytic unless it is spontaneously broken .",
    "we therefore find it difficult to believe the idea of the regauged space translation @xcite is tenable .",
    "this idea has also led to the self - contradiction in their work as pointed out by shi @xcite .",
    "moreover , there was a fundamental misunderstanding @xcite on the gauge invariant explanation of the meissner effect @xcite and the bcs theory @xcite .",
    "lastly we discuss a possible formation of a close - packed lattice as @xmath511 in bec , which is equivalent to applying high pressure to an atomic gas in a trap .",
    "our ground state wave function describes a degenerate bose gas modified as little as possible by the presence of the repulsive pair - interaction [ see eq .",
    "( [ cat2 ] ) ] @xcite .",
    "hence the bec in a trap provides an excellent test for this controversial problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is highly unlikely that , from our experience in a superconductor , a long range force could change the essential picture of our discussion in the absence of the electron - pair interactions ( cooper pairs ) of electrons in the system @xcite",
    ".    it may be worth emphasizing that gorkov s theory of superconductivity @xcite demonstrated that both the energy - gap function @xmath445 and the ginzburg - landau order parameter @xmath512 vary as @xmath513 , where @xmath72 is the fermi energy .",
    "because of this time dependence , the fermi level plays an important role in the phenomenology of superconductivity which is different from that of normal metals , and thus the energy gap function due to a virtual electron - electron interaction near the fermi surface is essential to a super - conducting state @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed analysis shows that , in the limit @xmath514 [ see eq .",

    "( [ eigen ] ) @xcite :    @xmath515    it is again independent of @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that if there is actually a transition from bec to a crystalline ground state , then the ground state is a classical lattice .",
    "the above discussion explains to some extent why a simple model based on the imperfect bose gas that does not include long range interaction predicts a better logical structure with the classical close - packed lattice than a super - lattice .",
    "the theory of broken symmetry is remarkably successful to give an unequivocal answer to this controversial question of a super - lattice @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism by which the close - packed lattice can be realized is again the spontaneously broken symmetry that accompanies a longitudinal phonon as nambu - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "since the spontaneously broken symmetry is the consequence of superfluidity described by @xmath6 in odlro , it is highly unlikely that we could observe a super - lattice in an laboratory experiment by compression , since we can not find a physical mechanism by which we can transform he ii into a superconductor @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a perturbation method appropriate to the determination of a phonon spectrum of collective excitations in a finite bose system .",
    "the new perturbation method based on odlro and the particle orbit perturbations by the lagrangian displacement vectors in bohm s quantum theory shows that a remarkably simple algebra yields not only a correct phonon spectrum of the sound wave but also the dispersion relations for surface waves in a finite space problem .",

    "would face the same criticism ; in particular the bogoliubov - de gennes equation should not be applied to a finite space problem , since the quantum field theory remains valid only in a hilbert space @xcite .",

    "however , a vortex creation by a broken symmetry accompanies a roton whose effective mass is @xmath516 that can be treated as a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "this large mass can be explained by the effective quantum mechanical potential by which a particle fluctuates to a higher energy ( _ i.e. , _",
    "bohm s irreducible disturbance @xcite ) , because the vortex creation involves a bulk of a large superfluid with higher energy and the radius of curvature of a free surface is also extremely small being in the order of many @xmath517 .",

    "<S> this paper presents an elementary theory of the phase - coherent collective excitations in both he ii in the gravitational field and atomic bose - einstein condensation in a trap . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is based on the concept of off - diagonal long - range order by penrose and onsager and the quantum theory of bohm , with emphasis on the broken symmetry in a bose - einstein gas with repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a spontaneously broken symmetry that accompanies a phonon ( nambu - goldstone mode ) takes place at the surface layer of an inhomogeneous bose system in the presence of an external field . </S>",
    "<S> the spontaneously broken symmetry in a bose system is described and is shown to manifest itself in both he ii and the bose - einstein condensation of an imperfect bose gas - a shell - like structure of the bose - einstein condensation in a trap . the broken symmetry gives a coherent explanation for a number of long standing puzzles in he ii .    </S>",
    "<S> the collective excitations in a liquid helium are essential for a complete understanding of certain properties of the liquid helium at low temperature , particularly its interaction with the external gravitational field , which is similar to that of the meissner effect in a superconductor in an external magnetic field except for a characteristic difference arising from the statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed derivation of dispersion relations for the various collective excitations in a surface layer in he ii , in which landau s two - fluid model breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in the surface layer that , in addition to the usual surface waves ( a gravity and a capillary waves ) , there is also a transverse collective excitation with entirely different behavior from the phase - coherent longitudinal excitation ( phonon ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is further shown that the spontaneously broken symmetry due to fluctuation and dissipation of the system is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for the conservation of energy in an isolated system . </S>"
