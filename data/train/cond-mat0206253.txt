    "recently there has been a growing interest in a comparison between classical turbulence and quantum turbulence in superfluid@xmath0he @xcite .",
    "the ideal comparison requires experiments on homogeneous quantum turbulence produced by a grid towed at a steady velocity through the helium @xcite , and there is particular interest in the case of very low temperatures , when there is practically no normal fluid .",
    "steady towing of a grid at these low temperatures leads to severe experimental problems , so the only existing relevant experiment used an oscillating grid instead of a towed grid @xcite .",
    "any interpretation of this experiment requires an understanding of the behaviour of inhomogeneous quantum turbulence , and this paper aims to provide relevant evidence , based on a computer simulation of the diffusion of a localized random vortex tangle .",
    "the results show that diffusion in this case is very slow , as is to be expected from simple dimensional considerations",
    ". low - temperature grid turbulence may involve motion on scales much larger than that associated with a random tangle , which is of order the vortex - line spacing , in which case diffusion would be faster .",

    "the required equation of motion of the vortices and the numerical procedures are described in detail in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the tangle is confined to a 1 cm cube .",
    "an initial configuration of six vortex rings is allowed to evolve under a counterflow at 1.6k , using the local induction approximation .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied at the faces normal to the flow ; the other faces are taken as solid .",
    "when a random tangle has developed , the counterflow is turned off and the temperature reduced to zero , vortices with parts in the right - hand half of the cube are removed , and the evolution of the remaining vortices is followed , now with a fully non - local biot - savart dynamics .",
    "the evolution involves both decay and diffusion .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the decay of a homogeneous vortex tangle is described by the vinen s equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the vortex line density and @xmath4 is the quantum of circulation ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 depends on temperature , being about 0.3 at zeto temperature @xcite .",
    "a simple generalization of this equation for an inhomogeneous system can be obtained by adding a diffusion term .",
    "the resulting equation is unlikely to be rigorously correct , but it will serve for a preliminary analysis of the experiments results .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a diffusion coefficient , assumed constant for a given temperature .",
    "we see from the results in figure 2 that as time proceeds the line density falls near the wall at @xmath9 .",
    "this feature is not described by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and it is due presumably to an enhanced vortex decay rate in the neighbourhood of the wall . we take it into account by allowing @xmath10 to increase close to the wall . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simulations are based on a finite spatial resolution , @xmath11 . the parameter @xmath10 is therefore increased over the range from @xmath9 to @xmath12 from the value @xmath10 to a value @xmath13 .    we have solved eq . ( 2 ) numerically for the situation obtaining in the experiments . taking @xmath14 , and regarding @xmath8 and @xmath15 as adjustable parameters ,",
    "we have carried out least square fits to the experimental data .",
    "we find that at all times @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "an theoretical estimate of the likely value of @xmath8 can be obtained as follows .",
    "we assume that the tangle is random , so that there is no significant superfluid motion on a scale larger than the line spacing @xmath18 .",
    "then the only length scale relevant to the vortex motion is @xmath19 and the only velocity scale is @xmath20 ( we ignore logarithmic corrections arising from line curvature ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath8 must be of order @xmath4 , as is observed .",
    "the diffusion of an inhomogeneous random vortex tangle has been studied numerically with the vortex filament model .",
    "the diffusion can be described by a generalization of the vinen equation , with a diffusion constant close to @xmath21 .",
    "this result may be relevant to the generation of superfluid turbulence with an oscillating grid @xcite .",
    "if the tangle that is produced has associated with it no motion on a length scale larger than the line spacing , then , as we see , the diffusion is very small , and the tangle can be expected to remain localized in the neighbourhood of the grid .",
    "if motion on a larger scale is generated , then the diffusion will be enhanced .    5 w.f.vinen , this proceedings .",
