    "<S> [ fig : fig3](c)-(e ) for spin - echo measurements of qubit 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that dephasing can be explained by the combination of an exponential decay process and a gaussian decay process . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the dephasing rate , given by @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the resonator decay rate for the first mode , is smaller than @xmath69 , thus a negligible contribution to dephasing .    </S>",
    "<S> we next consider dephasing due to charge noise , arising either from offset charges or quasiparticles on the qubit islands , as a potential source of dephasing at the symmetry point . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation of the persistent qubit transition frequency by charges , denoted by @xmath70 , decreases exponentially with the ratio of the josephson ( @xmath71 ) to charging ( @xmath72 ) energy  @xcite . </S>",
