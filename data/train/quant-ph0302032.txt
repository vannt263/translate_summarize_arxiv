    "we restrict attention to ebt maps on qubits , for which one can obtain a number of results which do not hold for general ebt maps .",
    "the main new result , which does not hold in higher dimensions , is that every qubit ebt map can be written as a convex combination of maps in the subclass of cq maps defined above .    before proving this result in section  [",

    "[ thm : sign ] let @xmath214 be a fixed vector in @xmath215 and let @xmath216 denote the convex subset of @xmath215 corresponding to the vectors @xmath205 $ ] for which the canonical map with these parameters is completely positive .",
    "then the intersection of @xmath216 with its inversion through the origin ( i.e. , @xmath217 ) is the subset of ebt maps with translation @xmath13 .",
    "the effect of changing the sign of @xmath112 is @xmath218 and of changing the sign of @xmath111 is @xmath219 . in either case , the effect on the determinant condition ( [ eq.detcond ] ) is simply to switch @xmath218 , i.e , to reflect the boundary across the @xmath220 line .",
    "thus , the intersection of these two regions will correspond to entanglement breaking channels .",
    "the remainder will , typically , consist of 4 disjoint ( non - convex ) regions , corresponding to the four corners remaining after the `` rounded octahedron '' of theorem [ thm : sign ] is removed from the `` rounded tetrahedron '' .",
    "in @xcite we found it useful to generalize the extreme points of the set of cpt maps @xmath221 to include all maps for which @xmath180 is unitary , which is equivalent to the statement that _ both _ singular values of @xmath180 are @xmath222 .",
    "in addition to true extreme points , this includes `` quasi - extreme '' points which correspond to the edges of the tetrahedron of unital maps",
    ". some of these quasi - extreme points are true extreme points for the set of entanglement - breaking maps",
    ". however , there are no extreme points of the latter which are not generalized extreme points of @xmath221 .",
    "this will allow us to conclude the following .",
    "first we note that the following was shown in @xcite .",
    "after reduction to canonical form ( [ eq : tcanon ] ) , for any map which is a generalized extreme point , the parameters @xmath29 must satisfy ( up to permutation ) @xmath223 .",
    "this is compatible with the sign change condition if and only if at least two of the @xmath44 , which implies that @xmath1 be a cq map .",
    "we now wish to examine in more detail those maps for which @xmath180 is not unitary .",
    "we can assume , without loss of generality , that the singular values of @xmath180 can be written as @xmath224 and @xmath225 , that @xmath226 , and that @xmath227 .",
    "recall that we showed in lemma 15 of @xcite that one can use the singular value decomposition of @xmath180 to write r _",
    "= v w^ = u_+ + u_- where @xmath228 . and @xmath229 are unitary .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is the midpoint of a line segment in @xmath221 and can be written as [ eq : convcb2 ] = _",
    "u+ + _ u- with @xmath230 defined as in ( [ eq : genu ] ) .",
    "although @xmath230 need not have the canonical form ( [ eq : tcanon ] ) , they are related so that their sum does .",
    "we now use the singular value decomposition of @xmath180 to decompose it into unitary maps in another way .",
    "r _ & = & [ eq : rsingval ] v w^ + & = & v w^ + [ eq : preconvcomb ] & = & vw^ + v _ z w^ .",
    "moreover , it follows from ( [ eq : preconvcomb ] ) that [ eq : convcb3 ] = _",
    "vw^ + _ v _ z w^ + ( 1 - _ 1 ) _ 0 where @xmath231 is the qc map corresponding to @xmath232 .",
    "since we have assumed that we do _ not _ have @xmath233 , equation ( [ eq : convcb3 ] ) represents @xmath1 as a non - trivial convex combination of at least _ two _ distinct cpt maps , the first two of which are generalized extreme points .",
    "( unless @xmath234 or @xmath235 , we will have three distinct points , and can already conclude that @xmath1 lies in the interior of a segment of a plane within @xmath221 . ) now , the assumption that @xmath236 suffices to show that the decompositions ( [ eq : convcb3 ] ) and ( [ eq : convcb2 ] ) involve different sets of extreme points and , hence , that @xmath1 can be written as a point on two distinct line segments in @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , there is a segment of a plane in @xmath221 which contains @xmath1 and for which @xmath1 does not lie on the boundary of the plane ( although the plane might be on the boundary of @xmath221 ) .",
    "thus we have proved the following .",
    "now let @xmath237 denote the set of maps for which @xmath238 or , equivalently @xmath239 , is in @xmath221 . since @xmath237 is a convex set isomorphic to @xmath221 , its elements can also be broken into two classes as above .",
    "the set of entanglement breaking maps is precisely @xmath240",
    ". we can now prove theorem  [ sect : convcq ] by showing that the convex hull of cq maps is @xmath240 .",
    "let @xmath1 be in @xmath240 which is also a convex set .",
    "if @xmath1 is a generalized extreme point of either @xmath221 or @xmath237 , then the only possibility consistent with @xmath1 being entanglement - breaking is that it is cq .",
    "thus we suppose that @xmath1 belongs to class ii for both @xmath241 and @xmath242",
    ". then @xmath1 lies within a plane in @xmath241 and within a plane in @xmath242 .",
    "the intersection of these two planes is non - empty ( since it contains @xmath1 ) and its intersection must contain a line segment in @xmath240 which contains @xmath1 and for which @xmath1 is _ not _ an endpoint . therefore , @xmath1 is _ not _ an extreme point of @xmath240 .",
    "thus all possible extreme points of @xmath240 must be generalized extreme points of @xmath221 or @xmath237 , in which case they are cq .",
    "although this shows that all extreme points of @xmath240 are cq maps , this need not hold for the various convex subsets , corresponding to allowed values of @xmath243 in a fixed basis , discussed at the start of section  [ sect : cp ] .",
    "the following remark shows that `` most '' points in the convex subset @xmath110 of the @xmath111-@xmath112 plane can , in fact , be written as a convex combination of cq maps in canonical form in the same basis .",
    "it also shows why it is necessary to go outside this region for those points close to the boundary .",
    "* first consider the set of entanglement - breaking maps with @xmath244 , which is the convex set @xmath245 .",
    "every extreme point must be an extreme point of the convex set @xmath246 for some @xmath100 . by theorem [ thm : rsw ] , these are the maps for which @xmath247 is unitary , which implies that either * * @xmath203 and @xmath248 which implies that either @xmath249 or @xmath250 with @xmath251 for @xmath252 or @xmath253 , _ or _ * * @xmath199 and @xmath254 . + the first type of extreme point is obviously a cq map ; the second is a `` point '' channel which , as noted before , is a special case of a cq map . thus any map in @xmath246 can be written as a convex combination of cq maps in @xmath246 . +",
    "similar results hold if @xmath249 or @xmath250 .",
    "therefore , any entanglement breaking channel with some @xmath44 , can be written as a convex combination of cq channels with at most one non - zero @xmath29 _ in the same basis_. thus any planar channel can be written as a convex combination of cq channels in the same plane .",
    "* next consider entanglement - breaking maps with at most one non - zero @xmath135 .",
    "we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath203 in which case the conditions for complete positivity reduce to ( [ eq : cp.tau0 ] ) .",
    "combining this with the sign change condition yields ( |_1| + | _ 2|)^2 ( 1 - | _ 3|)^2 - t_3 ^ 2 .",
    "it follows that for each fixed value of @xmath99 the set of allowable @xmath255 form a square with corners @xmath256 where @xmath257 .",
    "thus , the extreme points of @xmath258 are planar channels which , by part(a ) are in the convex hull of cq channels . in particular , a map with @xmath259 ,",
    "can be written as a convex combination of cq maps with either @xmath250 or @xmath244 .",
    "however , these maps need not necessarily lie in @xmath258 ; we can only be sure that @xmath249 and @xmath260 , but not that @xmath261 .",
    "thus we can only state that @xmath258 is in the convex hull of those cq maps with @xmath262 and @xmath263 for either @xmath252 or @xmath253 .",
    "although it may be necessary to enlarge the set @xmath258 in order to ensure that it is in the convex hull of some subset of cq maps , these cq maps will have the canonical form _ in the same basis _ , and the same value for @xmath99 in that basis .",
    "* now consider the convex subset @xmath264 of the @xmath111-@xmath112 plane corresponding to entanglement breaking maps with @xmath265 fixed .",
    "these two regions intersect when either @xmath249 or @xmath250 ( or , equivalently , @xmath266 where @xmath136 ) .",
    "one can again use part ( a ) to see that these intersection points can be written as convex combinations of cq maps in canonical form in the _",
    "same basis_. since their convex hull has the same property , the resulting parallelogram , as shown in figure  [ fig : convhull ] , is also a convex combination of cq maps of the same type .",
    "only for those points in the strip between the parallelogram and the boundary might one need to make a change of basis in order to write the maps as a convex combination of cq maps .",
    "* now suppose @xmath267 . since any two signs can be changed by conjugation with a pauli matrix , @xmath1 is unitarily equivalent to a map with @xmath268 .",
    "one can then conjugate with another unitary matrix ( corresponding to a rotation on the bloch sphere ) to conclude that @xmath1 is unitarily equivalent to a channel @xmath269 with @xmath270 , and @xmath271 .",
    "it then follows from part ( b ) that @xmath269 , and thus also @xmath1 , can be written as a convex combination of cq channels which have the form described above in the _ rotated basis_. however , these maps need not necessarily have the canonical form in the original basis .",
    "consider the region @xmath169 with @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "the maps with @xmath274 lie on the boundary of this region ( in fact , at the intersection of the boundary with the @xmath142 axes , as shown in figure  [ fig : convhulloct ] ) . since these maps have the form considered in part ( d ) they can be written as a convex combination of cq maps",
    "; however , those cq maps need not have the canonical form in the original basis .",
    "nevertheless , every point in the octagon formed from the convex hull of the intersection points of the lines @xmath275 , @xmath276 , and @xmath277 with the boundary , as shown in figure  [ fig : convhulloct ] ) , can be written as a convex combination of cq maps as described above .",
    "as another example , consider the set of entanglement breaking maps with @xmath278 fixed .",
