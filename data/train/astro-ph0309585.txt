    "the search for sources of high - energy extraterrestrial neutrinos is the primary mission of the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) .",
    "the mechanism for accelerating cosmic rays to energies above the `` knee '' ( @xmath1 ) remains a mystery .",
    "cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated in the shock fronts of galactic objects like supernova remnants , microquasars and magnetars , and in extragalactic sources such as the cores of active galaxies ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite .",
    "high energy protons accelerated in these objects will collide with the ambient gas and radiation surrounding the acceleration region , or with matter or radiation intervening between the source and the earth .",
    "this leads to pion production , the charged pions decaying into highly energetic muon and electron neutrinos , and the neutral pions decaying into the observed @xmath0-rays .",
    "fermi acceleration of charged particles in magnetic shocks naturally leads to power - law spectra , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is typically close to -2 . by the time the neutrinos reach the earth ,",
    "vacuum oscillations will have uniformly populated all three flavors ( unless the neutrinos are unstable @xcite ) .",
    "all limits quoted in this letter are on the muon neutrino flux arriving at the earth ; limits at the source will be approximately a factor of two higher due to oscillations .",
    "neutrino astronomy may provide information complementary to the knowledge obtained from high energy photons and charged particles , since neutrinos propagate directly from their point of origin undeflected by magnetic fields .",
    "therefore they have the potential to reveal `` hidden '' sources masked by photon absorption .",
    "probing the neutrino sky may bring us closer to solving the cosmic ray mystery , or might even reveal something completely new and unexpected .",
    "amanda - ii @xcite is a cherenkov detector frozen into the antarctic polar icecap",
    ". a high energy muon neutrino interacting with the ice or bedrock in the vicinity of the detector results in a high energy muon propagating up to tens of kilometers . the muon track is reconstructed based on detection of the cherenkov light emitted as it propagates through a 19-string array of 677 photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the median neutrino pointing resolution is 2 - 2.5@xmath4 , depending weakly on declination , and is dominated by the resolution of the muon track reconstruction .",
    "amanda - ii demonstrates a significant improvement over its predecessor in acceptance and background rejection , especially near the horizon .",
    "results from the first phase of amanda , the 10-string subdetector amanda - b10 , have been reported in @xcite .",
    "atmospheric muons from cosmic rays that penetrate to amanda depths are the dominant background .",
    "amanda - ii views the neutrino sky above the northern hemisphere using the earth as an atmospheric muon filter .",
    "cosmic rays also produce neutrinos in the earth s atmosphere , but with a spectral index of @xmath5 , softer than expected for astrophysical sources .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are an important source for calibration in amanda @xcite , but are also background to a search for extraterrestrial point sources .",
    "a point source search is conducted by looking for excess events above the background , which is experimentally measured for a given angular search bin by taking the average background rate in the same band of declination .",
    "the data set comprises @xmath6 triggered events collected over 238 days between february and november , 2000 , with 197.0 days livetime after correcting for 17.2% detector dead - time .",
    "after application of an iterative series of maximum - likelihood reconstruction algorithms , 2.1 million events reconstructed with declination @xmath7 remain in the experimental sample .",
    "to prevent bias in the selection of cuts , the data are `` blinded '' by randomizing the reconstructed right ascension ( r.a . )",
    "angle of each event .",
    "the output of a neural network ( nn ) trained on simulated events and using six input variables ( such as the number of unscattered photon hits , track length , likelihood of the muon track reconstruction , and topological variables @xcite ) , is used as a quality cut .",
    "a second cut is placed on the likelihood ratio ( lr ) between the muon track reconstruction and a muon reconstruction weighted by an atmospheric muon prior @xcite .",
    "the prior describes the zenith - dependent frequency of downgoing muons such that choosing a cut on the lr gives downgoing hypotheses a prior weight of up to @xmath8 more than the upgoing hypotheses , effectively forcing events surviving the cut to be of higher quality .",
    "the final choice of nn quality cut , likelihood ratio cut , and the optimum size for a search bin are determined independently in each @xmath9 band of declination in order to optimize the limit setting potential of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the directional information is then restored ( data `` unblinded '' ) for the calculation of the limits and significances .",
    "a full simulation chain @xcite including neutrino absorption in the earth , neutral current regeneration , muon propagation and detector response is used to simulate the point source signal according to an @xmath10 energy spectrum .",
    "the limits obtained in this analysis are a function of the measured background , @xmath11 , as well as the expected number of events , @xmath12 , from a simulated flux @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of observed events in the given source bin , and @xmath16 is the 90% upper limit on the number of events following the unified ordering prescription of feldman and cousins @xcite .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos were used to determine the absolute normalization of the detector simulation .",
    "the normalization factor 0.86 is consistent with the theoretical uncertainty of 25% on the atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty , which includes the theoretical uncertainty of the atmospheric neutrino flux and statistical uncertainty of the measured background , is incorporated into the limits using the cousins - highland @xcite prescription with unified feldman - cousins ordering @xcite but with a more appropriate choice of the likelihood ratio test @xcite .",
    "coincident events between the spase air shower array @xcite and amanda - ii were used to evaluate the systematic error in pointing accuracy .",
    "this value was determined to be less than @xmath17 , which results in signal loss in a typical search bin of only 5% .",
    "the final sample consists of 699 upwardly reconstructed ( @xmath7 ) events , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ skyplot ] .",
    "a comparison to the normalized atmospheric neutrino simulation reveals that for declinations @xmath18 the sample is strongly dominated by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "shows the onset of cosmic muon background contamination.,width=316 ]    a binned search for excesses in the region has been performed .",
    "the search grid contains 301 rectangular bins with zenith - dependent widths ranging from based on the aforementioned bin - size optimization .",
    "the grid is shifted 4 times in declination and right ascension to fully cover boundaries between the bins of the original configuration .",
    "the number of times to shift the grid was studied , taking into account statistical penalties for the number of shifts by using simulated event samples , and set at a level where further shifts do not markedly improve the average maximum significance obtained on simulated poisson - fluctuated signals of similar magnitude to the background .",
    "the most significant excess , observed at about @xmath19 , is 8 events observed on an expected background of 2.1 .",
    "simulation reveals a probability of 51% to observe such an excess as a random upward fluctuation of the background .",
    "in addition to the binned search , we place limits on a number of extragalactic and galactic candidate sources .",
    "circular bins with optimized radii are positioned at each candidate position ; the number of expected background events is given by the number of observed events in the declination band scaled down to the search bin area .",
    "the same method applied to any point in the northern hemisphere yields neutrino flux upper limits shown in fig .",

    "@xmath20 an adjacent region at lower declination was used for the background estimation .",
    "the average flux upper limits for @xmath10 spectra obtained in an ensemble of identical experiments in the case of no true signal is shown vs. declination in fig .",
    "it should be pointed out that due to the large number of cells tested a single source with a flux at the sensitivity level ( 90% average flux upper limit ) would normally be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation .",
    "therefore a flux a few times higher would be needed to make a discovery of a point source possible in the binned search .     for an assumed @xmath10 spectrum , integrated above @xmath21 .",
