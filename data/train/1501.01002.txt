    "an important goal of modern cosmology is to understand the formation and properties of early galaxies that formed a few hundred million years after the big bang @xcite . in the context of hierarchical cosmology ,",
    "where small structures form first and evolve into bigger systems , dwarf galaxies with virial masses of @xmath5 at @xmath6 were the basic building blocks of large galaxies seen today .",
    "furthermore , it is thought that these galaxies played a pivotal role in reionizing the universe , the global phase transition from an early neutral medium to a fully ionized one ( for reviews see , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the first galaxies were the drivers of the initial stages of reionization ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    over the past decade",
    ", there have been enormous efforts to push the high redshift frontier to @xmath7 , detecting light from galaxies with a stellar mass of @xmath8 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to assess the observability of even smaller galaxies , and galaxies at even higher redshifts , we need to predict the properties of the first galaxies by pushing numerical simulations to new levels of physical realism and detail .",
    "our goal here is to derive ab - initio predictions for key quantities , such as their stellar population mix , quantified by a possibly time - variable initial mass function ( imf ) , star formation rates ( sfrs ) , metallicities , and resulting broad - band colour and recombination - line spectra ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a sfr above @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath10 , might be required for galaxies at @xmath11 to be observed with the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . for _ jwst",
    "_ deep fields to reach even fainter systems , a magnification boost from gravitational lensing may be required @xcite .",
    "the properties of such early galaxies were determined by the feedback from preceding generations of stars ( for a review see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first generation of stars , the so - called population  iii ( pop  iii ) , formed at @xmath12 in dark matter ( dm ) minihaloes with @xmath13 , predominately via ro - vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen ( @xmath14 ) cooling ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "radiation from pop  iii stars dramatically altered the gas within their host minihaloes , through photoionization , photoheating , and photoevaporation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once a pop  iii star died as a supernova ( sn ) , heavy elements were dispersed , enriching the intra - host and intergalactic medium ( igm ) , thus initiating the prolonged process of chemical evolution ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting sn feedback from the first stars greatly affected the gas in the shallow potential wells of the host systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the more distant , diffuse igm was heated as well by x - rays emitted by accreting single black holes ( bhs ) , or high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , both remnants of pop  iii stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the critical role of feedback from stars in massive galaxies with @xmath15 is also emphasized by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization , radiation pressure , and sn feedback operate in a non - linear , coupled fashion , such that considering a full treatment of the radiation - hydrodynamics and time dependence of these feedback mechanisms is necessary to reproduce the observed histories of star formation , including their stochastic nature , particularly in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". however , due to the prohibitive computational cost related to the baryonic physics , simulating the assembly of massive galaxies from first principles is not feasible .",
    "the first dwarf galaxies with virial masses @xmath16 , where such ab - initio modeling is coming within reach , thus provide us with ideal laboratories to develop a detailed theory of feedback - regulated galaxy formation .",
    "the birth of the first galaxies is often defined by theorists as the emergence of atomic cooling haloes , systems assembled at @xmath17 with masses of @xmath18 , within which the primordial gas was able to cool via atomic hydrogen lines instead of molecular hydrogen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the deeper potential wells of these haloes allowed them to sustain self - regulated star formation in a multi - phase medium by holding on to the gas driven out by stellar feedback .",
    "another feature that renders the atomic cooling haloes viable first galaxy candidates is the presence of supersonic turbulence , which is believed to play an important role in present - day star formation @xcite .",
    "such turbulence is expected to develop during the build - up of the first galaxies due to the inflow of cold gas along cosmic filaments ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the relative importance of pop  iii stellar feedback on first galaxy formation is determined by the mass range of pop  iii stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "stars with initial masses in the range of @xmath19 , or larger than @xmath20 , are expected to directly collapse into bhs , whereas they undergo pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) in the range of @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pisn range can be extended down to @xmath22 if the progenitor is rapidly rotating ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , stars with masses between @xmath23 and @xmath24 likely died as conventional core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) , or energetic hypernovae in case of high rotation rates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "earlier studies had predicted that the first stars formed in isolation , with a characteristic mass of @xmath25 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent high - resolution simulations , exploring the high densities encountered in protostellar disks , have suggested that the primordial cloud can further fragment , giving rise to the possibility of binary or multiple systems @xcite .",
    "radiation - hydrodynamical simulations that take into account the feedback from the protostellar radiation suggest that the first stars typically reached masses of a few @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is indeed the case , the feedback from primordial stars would have been less disruptive than previously thought ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , pisn events would have been less frequent , with the majority of pop  iii stars now expected to die as ccsne .",
    "it is therefore important to revisit the assembly process of the first galaxies , taking this change in characteristic pop  iii mass scale into account .",
    "most previous studies have been focusing on the feedback from massive pop  iii stars ( @xmath27 ) on first galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one prominent result is that even a single pisn with an explosion energy of @xmath28  erg , and a metal yield of @xmath29 , has a dramatic impact on subsequent evolution , evacuating the gas within the host halo , and preventing further star formation for about a hubble time , @xmath30300myr at @xmath31 .",
    "as the ejected metals fall back into the emerging galaxy , the central gas is enriched up to @xmath32 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the recovery from the feedback of less massive pop  iii stars ( @xmath33 ) , followed by ccsne with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , was rather prompt , with recovery timescales of only a few @xmath36myr @xcite .",
    "such prompt recovery allowed the first galaxies to experience multiple episodes of star formation prior to their assembly ( @xcite ) .",
    "related to this weakened feedback , the star - forming gas inside the first galaxies was possibly enriched by multiple sne .",
    "the resulting metal enrichment was sufficient to affect a transition of the star formation mode from pop  iii to normal , population  ii ( pop  ii ) stars .",
    "thus , regions that hosted moderate mass pop  iii stars would locally undergo the transition to ( low - mass dominated ) pop  ii star formation earlier on .",
    "the minimum ( `` critical '' ) metallicity for the pop  iii / pop  ii transition depends on which cooling is responsible for the gas fragmentation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "fine - structure line cooling , mainly via c  ii and o  i , above @xmath37 , leads to vigorous fragmentation of the gas cloud , giving rise to the formation of stellar clusters .",
    "further fragmentation can be achieved at very high densities , @xmath38 , via dust continuum cooling if the initial gas - to - dust ratio exceeds @xmath39\\times10^{-9}$ ] ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "globally , the pop  iii / pop  ii transition is a gradual process , as the ejected metals are brought back into virialized host haloes , keeping a large fraction of the igm still pristine .",
    "therefore , those two populations co - existed , such that pop  iii star formation was still possible even at @xmath40 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    here",
    ", we present the results of a cosmological zoom - in , high - resolution radiation - hydrodynamics simulation , following the first galaxy assembly process from first principles .",
    "we consider realistic descriptions of pop  iii / pop  ii star formation , photoionization and photoheating from stars , the mechanical and chemical feedback from pisne and ccsne , and the x - ray feedback from accreting bhs and hmxbs .",
    "guided by the results from recent investigations of primordial star formation , we in particular explore the implications of a somewhat less top - heavy pop  iii imf , with a characteristic mass of a few @xmath41 , giving rise to a large fraction of ccsne rather than pisne .    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "our numerical methodology is described in section  2 , and the simulation results are presented in section  3 . finally , our main findings are summarized in section  4 . for consistency ,",

    "the initial conditions within a cubic volume @xmath43 on a side are generated by assuming a @xmath44cdm cosmology with a matter density parameter of @xmath45 , baryon density @xmath46 , present - day hubble expansion rate @xmath47 , spectral index @xmath48 , and normalization @xmath49 .",
    "the initial conditions are hierarchically refined by a consecutive zoom - in technique , rendering the masses of dark matter ( dm ) and sph particles in the highest resolution region with an approximate linear size of @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we adopt the gravitational softening length @xmath53 comoving pc for both dm and baryonic particles .",
    "we start our simulations at @xmath54 and follow the cosmic evolution of the dm and gas until the assembly process of the first galaxy has been completed at @xmath1 .",
    "we consider all relevant primordial chemistry and cooling processes .",
    "specifically , we include h and he collisional ionization , excitation and recombination cooling , bremsstrahlung , inverse compton cooling , and collisional excitation cooling of @xmath14 and hd .",
    "the code self - consistently solves the non - equilibrium chemistry for 9 abundances ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , as well as for the three deuterium species @xmath57 , and hd .",
    "additionally , metal - enriched gas can also be cooled by metal species , specifically c , o , and si , with solar relative abundances . for the metal cooling rates ,",
    "we adopt the results of @xcite .",
    "the chemical network comprises the key species , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that all the metals are in gas phase atoms or ions , and thus we do not consider dust cooling as the gas densities explored in this work are far below the threshold value above which it starts to become important .        for the star formation , we do not form stars by following the evolution from the initial protostars to the final mass ( e.g. @xcite ) , rather we adopt a sink algorithm ( @xcite ) , where stars are represented by sink particles .",
    "once a gas particle exceeds the threshold density , @xmath60 , the highest - density sph particle is converted into a collisionless sink particle , subsequently accreting neighboring gas particles until the mass of the pop  iii star is reached .",

    ", it behaves as a salpeter - like imf , but is exponentially cutoff below that mass ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once a sink particle forms , we prevent the subsequent star formation in a sphere with radius 30 pc centered on the sink particle for @xmath64 myr .",
    "this is because it takes time for the hydrodynamical shocks with a velocity @xmath3030 km / s , generated by photoheating to sweep up and evacuate the central gas , reducing the central gas densities . without such temporary suppression in star formation",
    ", multiple stars might form at the same location at the same time .",
    "this would correspond to fragmentation within the sph smoothing kernel , which is not resolved , and would thus be physically unreliably .",
    "we allow sink particles to merge once their distance falls below 1pc , similar to the baryonic resolution scale @xmath65^{1/3 } \\approx 0.5 { ~\\mbox{pc}}$ ] , where @xmath66 is the hydrogen mass fraction . here , the baryonic mass resolution is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the number of particles in the sph smoothing kernel @xcite .",
    "the new positions and velocities of the merged sinks are computed by mass - weighted averaging .",
    "pop  ii stars are formed out of the gas cloud which is metal - enriched by the previous generation of stars .",
    "the star formation recipe is similar to that of pop  iii star formation except for one more condition : if the metallicity of a gas particle , eligible for star formation , exceeds the characteristic metallicity , @xmath69 , for the transition from pop  iii to pop  ii , we assume that a newly formed sink particle represents a pop  ii star cluster .",
    "therefore , once a sph particle satisfies those two criteria , @xmath60 and @xmath69 , we immediately create an effective sink particle with a mass of @xmath70 , by accreting surrounding gas particles .",
    "the mass of a pop  ii cluster @xmath70 is chosen to host one massive star @xmath71 , given a salpeter imf , @xmath72 , with a slope @xmath73 , which is from @xcite where they provide photoionization rates derived from an assumed imf for a pop  ii cluster . in the presence of a @xmath74 star ,",
    "further star formation inside of the cluster after the initial burst is truncated by the photoheating of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "once a star forms , the star particle emits ionizing radiation over its lifetime with a black - body spectrum .",
    "we use the radiative transfer ( rt ) code traphic to transport ionizing photons @xcite . in simulations with traphic , photon packets from radiation sources",
    "are transferred along the irregular , spatially adaptive grid set by sph particles in a photon - conserving manner through the simulation box .",
    "thanks to a photon packet merging technique in traphic , the computational cost is independent of the number of ionizing radiation sources , which enables large simulations considering many sources , and as presented here .",
    "the rt is controlled by a set of parameters , which we choose identical to those employed in @xcite , except that we here use two frequency bins , @xmath75 instead of @xmath76 , with bounding energies located at [ 13.6 ev , 400 ev , 10 kev ] . while the main focus of @xcite is to investigate the impact of x - rays on the gas in haloes and igm , requiring to track high energy photons denoted by the high characteristic frequencies , in this work we focus on the stellar feedback impact . to do so , two frequency bins , @xmath75 , are sufficient to represent the stellar spectrum .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers @xcite for further details concerning rt methods and to @xcite for the rt parameters we use in this work .",
    "the rt computation is coupled to the hydrodynamical evolution by passing the photoionization , photoheating , and photodissociation rates computed by the rt to the non - equilibrium solver for the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "for the ionizing photon rates of pop  iii stars and their lifetimes , we employ polynomial fits ( @xcite ) as a function of initial mass of a star , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , where @xmath79 . for pop  ii clusters , we use the value from @xcite that provides the properties of integrated stellar populations at various metallicities .",
    "in particular , we fixed the ionizing photon rate for the initial @xmath80 myr at @xmath81 , which is derived by averaging over a salpeter imf with a slope of @xmath73 and a metallicity of @xmath82 in the mass range of [ 1@xmath83 , 150@xmath83 ] . for the following evolution of the rates",

    "the emission from pop  ii stars lasts for 20 myr , corresponding to the typical lifetime of ob stars in the cluster .",
    "in addition to the ionizing radiation from individual pop  iii stars and pop  ii clusters , we also track the lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation from both populations that dissociates molecular hydrogen ( @xmath14 ) and deuterated hydrogen ( hd ) .",
    "this is treated in the optical thin limit with a self - shielding correction ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rate at which lw photons are emitted by pop  iii stars is fit using @xmath87 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we only allow stars to form within the highly resolved region corresponding to a linear size of @xmath88 300 comoving kpc and do not follow the propagation of photons outside the region . for simplicity , we do not consider a global uv background here .    , pop  iii star formation dominates , but as the gas is metal - enriched , the pop  ii mode becomes dominant below @xmath89 .",

    "may be expected , likely resulting in a hypernova ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , due to the uncertainty in the degree of spin of pop  iii stars , which is subject to stellar winds , gravitational and hydromagnetic instabilities ( e.g. @xcite ) , we only consider conventional ccsne by fixing the explosion energy and metal yield .    for the highly energetic pisne from pop  iii stars with masses in the range of @xmath96 ( @xcite )",

    "the lack of mass flux between sph particles means that metals are transported ballistically in an sph scheme ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "physically , the mixing of metals is achieved through an unresolved turbulent cascade from large scales to small scales , which is unresolved .",
    "therefore , often , a metal mixing is implemented by subgrid models in which physical processes below the smallest resolved scale are determined by physical quantities at resolved scales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a diffusion - based method implemented by @xcite which assume that the mixing efficiency on unresolved scales is determined by the physical properties on the scale of the sph smoothing kernel ( @xcite ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that the sfrds measured in the simulation are very episodic rather than continuous .",
    "this episodic , bursty star formation is mainly caused by a stellar feedback cycle : dense gas inside a halo is evacuated by photoheating from stars , the subsequent sn blastwave , or both , rendering it gas - starved for a certain time , until fresh gas is provided through smooth accretion or mergers with other haloes .",

    "specifically , most stars are argued to have formed before reionization in haloes with @xmath291 , giving rise to systems that have then passively evolved into a subset of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "next to reionization , photoheating and sn feedback act to evacuate the gas from the haloes .",
    "this scenario would naturally explain both the old age of the extant stellar populations , and the absence of any ongoing star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , the probability of a galaxy formed near the reionization era to remain intact and isolated , not undergoing mergers , is small , of order @xmath292 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , only a subset of the present - day local group dwarfs might be suitable candidates for comparison with the first galaxies @xcite .",

    "however , our simulation ends before reionization is complete . indeed ,",
    "further star formation and metal enrichment will likely occur , leading to pop  ii stars with higher metallicities .",
    "the effect of this missing activity may be to raise the average metallicity , possibly up to levels consistent with the empirical kirby - relation .",
    "therefore , tracing the evolution of the galaxy to @xmath296 , and ideally even beyond that , might be necessary to directly compare simulation results with observations .    to infer the star formation history of dwarf galaxies",

    "however , their simulation is performed in a small region ( < 400 pc ) with a rather idealized setup . in particular ,",
    "their high mean metallicity is caused by the assumption of an enrichment floor that is linearly increasing with the number of sne . on the other hand , pop  ii sn enrichment in our simulation",
    "does not impose any artificial metallicity floor , thus enabling lower metallicity conditions .     and @xmath299 , respectively , for the stars inside the target halo ( _ red _ ) and for all pop  ii stars in the high - resolution region ( _ black _ ) .",

    "we only consider emission from pop  ii stars .",
    "assuming an instantaneous starburst , the bolometric luminosity from a pop  ii cluster is represented by the following equation , @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the mass - luminosity relation .",

    "is given by ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the luminosity distance to a source at redshift @xmath290 , which is @xmath325 gpc at @xmath326 .",
    "the predicted flux for the galaxy ( @xmath327 ) in our simulation is @xmath328 for @xmath318 .",

    "therefore , more promising targets for detection with the _ jwst _ will be more massive , luminous , systems with @xmath329 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the other possible way of detecting those small galaxies is through gravitational lensing with a boost in brightness by a factor of @xmath330 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , magnifications of @xmath331 are extrmely rare , mainly due to the low probability of having sight lines for the gravitational lensing , @xmath332 ( e.g. @xcite ) , requiring very large survey areas to find the lensed galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the nebular emission in recombination lines are @xmath333 and @xmath334 , respectively , both of which are even weaker than the bolometric luminosity by @xmath335 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is mainly due to the low gas densities as a result of the photoheating from the newly forming stars , resulting in low recombination rates . in our estimate , we have assumed escape fractions for @xmath311 and @xmath312 photons of unity , rendering the calculated line luminosities upper limits .",
    "although the recombination luminosity in @xmath312 is higher than that in @xmath311 , in reality @xmath312 photons are more likely to scatter in the neutral igm ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thus the observed flux in @xmath312 may be substantially lower than implied by the intrinsic luminosity . because of the hard spectra of massive pop  iii stars , strong nebular emission , particularly in the he  ii @xmath336 line , has been suggested as a possible observable signature of metal - free pop  iii galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "as implied by our simulation , the gas inside the first galaxies is likely already metal - enriched , and thus their stellar content is expected to be dominated by pop  ii , instead of pop  iii , stars , making it more difficult to use the recombination lines as a probe to detect such metal - enriched small systems .",
    "finally , a complementary method is to look for counterparts of the first galaxies in the local group .",
    "assuming , probably unrealistically so , that star formation in our simulated galaxy is completely quenched after @xmath135 , and that it has passively evolved until the present day , the total stellar mass is @xmath337 at @xmath338 for the imf we use .",
    "this is comparable to the stellar mass @xmath339 of segue  2 , the least luminous dwarf galaxy known in the local universe ( @xcite ) .",

    "this is substantially smaller than @xmath266 , which has been used in most previous studies .",

    "+    \\(ii ) the gas inside the galaxy is enriched to @xmath340 by a total of 40 pop  iii and 248 pop  ii core - collapse supernovae ( ccsns ) . despite the striking difference in the star formation history , the degree of metal enrichment by ccsne is comparable to that by a single @xmath273 pop  iii pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) .",
    "+    \\(iii ) the metals produced by two pisne outside the main galaxy are mainly responsible for the metal enrichment in the diffuse igm , setting a metallicity floor of @xmath341 .",
    "therefore , signatures of pisne in the early universe may be found by studying the state of the igm , e.g. employing bright pop  iii grb afterglows .",

    "given the critical metallicity @xmath342 adopted here , pop  iii stars continue to form out of the gas in the metallicity range @xmath343 .",
    "thus , both pop  iii and pop  ii stars coexist .",
    "this conclusion , however , is uncertain , as the critical metallicity may well be lower , which would not allow any extended pop  iii star formation .",
    "+    \\(v ) due to the rarity of hmxbs and their short lifetimes , in combination with the low bh accretion rates @xmath344 , the impact of x - rays on the gas inside haloes that host x - ray sources and on the igm is negligible in this simulation .",
    "+    \\(vi ) the bolometric luminosity of the simulated galaxy is @xmath345 and the total stellar mass is @xmath264 at @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , the uv flux of the galaxy , redshifted into the near - ir is @xmath346 , significantly less than the detection limit for nircam onboard the _ jwst_. +    \\(vii ) the estimated metal distribution function ( mdf ) of pop  ii stars in the galaxy peaks at @xmath284=-3.75 $ ] and the stellar metallicities are in the range @xmath284=[-3.75 , -2.7]$ ] with a mean metallicity of @xmath284=-3.3 $ ] .",
    "the stellar mass of @xmath347 of the simulated galaxy , passively evolved to the present day , is comparable to that of segue  2 , the least luminous dwarf known in the local universe .",
    "+    it has often been pointed out that including a physically motivated description of stellar feedback is crucial for modeling galaxy formation , especially for small galaxies , which are susceptible to stellar feedback due to their shallow potential wells ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm that stellar feedback plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of the first galaxies : by reducing the baryon fraction ( @xmath348 ) , corresponding to @xmath226 of the cosmic mean , and by enriching the gas to an average of < @xmath271 > @xmath349 , making pop  ii star formation the dominant mode inside the first galaxies .",
    "however , galaxies may continue to form pop  iii stars because not all gas is enriched above the critical metallicity .    in our simulation",
    ", we needed to fix a large number of numerical input parameters , such as the random sampling of the pop  iii stellar masses from the underlying imf . given that computational resources limit us to only one such realization from a very large ensemble of likely parameter choices , the question arises what aspects of our simulation are contingent on the specific choice , and which results are likely robust .",
    "an example of a robust feature is that the first galaxies were already metal - enriched , such that their stellar content is expected to be pop  ii ; the precise level of this ` bedrock metallicity ' , on the other hand , is uncertain , but likely of order @xmath350 at @xmath1 .",
    "an example of a contingent , numerical - parameter dependent feature is the impact of x - ray feedback from early hmxb sources .",
    "we mention that x - ray feedback is negligible in our simulation , but the population of hmxbs , which are likely the strongest x - ray sources , and their luminosity and duty - cycle are unknown at high redshifts .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for discussion of a case where x - ray feedback is more significant .",
    "we show that the stellar mass fraction in halos is @xmath351 , which is smaller by an oder of magnitude than the values found in other studies , for example @xcite and @xcite , using abundance - matching techniques and grid - based simulations , respectively . however , the scatter from their work is large , such that @xmath352 ranges from @xmath353 to @xmath354 at a given mass of @xmath355 . on the other hand ,",
    "our estimated for @xmath352 is in a good agreement with the results from @xcite , in which they use an updated abundance - matching technique and reproduce the stellar mass functions of the milky way and andromeda satellites more accurately .",
    "the fact that near the end of our simulation the baryon fraction of the target halo is significantly reduced to 15@xmath156 of the cosmic mean , leading to a reduction in star formation , robustly implies a highly feedback - regulated regime .",
    "such inefficiency of star formation could be attributed to how we implement stellar feedback , especially the efficiency of sn feedback . however , even if the stellar mass were increased by a factor of 10 by adopting a different parameter implementation , this system would still be observationally out of reach for the _ jwst _ , at least in the absence of gravitational lensing .    whether fine - structure line cooling or dust - continuum cooling was mainly responsible for pop  ii star formation is still debated ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we had adopted a critical metallicity @xmath356 , set by dust continuum cooling , the assembly history of the target galaxy would have proceeded quite differently . adopting a lower critical metallicity than @xmath69 would boost the relative importance of pop  ii star formation , and long - lived pop  ii stars",
    "could hence contribute to the total stellar mass .",
    "the estimated mdf of pop  ii stars would also be changed depending on the critical metallicity .",
    "the nature and observational properties of the first galaxies thus sensitively depend not only on the mass scale of the first stars , as has previously been pointed out @xcite , but also on additional astrophysical parameters , such as the critical metallicity .",
    "considerable uncertainties remain in the treatment of metal mixing .",
    "we used a subgrid model ( @xcite ) in which we assume that the efficiency of metal mixing below the resolved scales is determined by physical quantities at resolved scales .",
    "@xcite propose a new implementation to more accurately capture the turbulent mixing in sph .",
    "further theoretical and observational studies are required to better understand the metal mixing process . as discussed , exploring a large range of parameters",
    "is needed to derive representative characteristics of high-@xmath290 dwarf galaxies . however , performing such a comprehensive suit of high - resolution , radiation - hydrodynamical simulations is computationally challenging .    as mentioned above",
    ", the direct detection of the simulated galaxy , with @xmath186 , will be out of reach even for the _ jwst _ , unless extreme , and probably unattainable , gravitational lensing magnifications are involved .",

    "stellar \" or ",
    "galactic \" archeology by searching for metal - poor stars in the milky way or in nearby dwarf galaxies .",
