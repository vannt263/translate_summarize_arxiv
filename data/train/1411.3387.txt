    "it is well known that the environment affects the morphological types of galaxies in clusters .",
    "many studies show that galaxies in clusters evolve morphologically , with spirals becoming redder and in some cases lenticular as the result of environmental effects ( dressler 1980 ; butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ; dressler 1997 ; poggianti 1999 ; poggianti 2009 ; kormedy & bender 2012 ) several mechanisms have been proposed for driving galaxy evolution , including processes that affect the stars , gas , and dark matter , and those that affect only the gas . in the first category we list ( i ) low - velocity tidal interactions and mergers ( e.g. ; ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; hernquist 1992 ) , ( ii ) high - velocity tidal interactions and collisions ( e.g. , moore 1996 ) , ( iii ) and tidal interaction between galaxies and the cluster as a whole or between galaxies and substructures within the cluster ( bekki 1999 ) . in the second category we list ( i )",
    "intracluster medium - interstellar medium ( icm - ism ) stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ; nulsen 1982 ; schulz & struck 2001 ; vollmer 2001 ; van gorkom 2004 ; cen 2014 ) , ( ii ) gas accretion , which may occur in the outskirt of clusters , and ( iii ) starvation or strangulation , where the galaxies could lose their gas reservoir thus preventing their accretion onto the galaxy ( larson , tinsley , & caldwell 1980 ) .",
    "while all of these processes probably do actually occur , it remains unclear which ones are dominant in driving the morphological evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "detailed studies of the stellar and ionized gas kinematics can help to discriminate between the different interaction processes .",
    "for example , gravitational interactions produce disturbed kinematics in both the stellar and gas components , whereas interactions of a hydrodynamic nature will directly affect only the gas .",
    "recently , with the advent of integral field units ( ifus ) such as densepak , sauron , gmos , sinfoni , and muse , these detailed studies become possible .",
    "the observed velocity fields can be compared with those from simulations ( e.g. bendo & barnes 2000 ; jesseit 2007 ; kronberger 2007 ; kronberger 2008 ) , providing important clues about the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution .",
    "the virgo cluster is the nearest moderately rich cluster with a galaxy population spanning a large range of morphological types .",
    "the cluster has a moderately dense icm , and is dynamically young with on - going sub - cluster mergers and infalling galaxies , making it into an ideal place for detailed studies of various environmental processes .",
    "moreover , the virgo cluster has a significant population of galaxies characterized by truncated star formation morphologies , with no h@xmath4 in the outer disk but strong h@xmath4 in the inner region ( koopmann & kenney , 2004 ) consistent with icm - ism stripping .",
    "however , some of them have in addition other peculiarities that are not presently well understood , presumably reflecting different types of interactions .",
    "these peculiar galaxies may be in the process of morphological transformation , and could be considered as `` snapshots '' in the evolutionary path from actively star - forming spiral galaxies to more passive spirals and lenticulars .    with these objectives in mind we present in this work a study of the stellar and ionized gas kinematics of 13 peculiar virgo cluster galaxies using integral - field spectroscopy techniques .",
    "we profit from the ability of this technique to accurately map two - dimensional velocity fields for both the stars and the ionized gas in the centers of these galaxies .",
    "this data set has been previously used to estimate the 3d cluster location of all sample galaxies by using stellar kinematics to derive their distances ( corts 2008 ) , and for a detailed investigation of the nature of two of the most peculiar galaxies of the present sample , ngc 4064 and ngc  4424 ( e.g. ; corts 2006 ) .",
    "the present paper is structured as follow ; a brief description of the galaxy sample is given in  2 .",
    "the observation and data reduction procedures are summarized in  3 .",
    "a description of the observed stellar and ionized gas kinematics is presented in  4 . in  5 , we summarize the kinematical peculiarities observed in these galaxies . in  6",
    ", we discuss the velocity dispersion profiles and kinematical support of these galaxies . in  7",
    ", we compare our observations with simulations of merger remnants , icm - ism stripped galaxies , and tidal interactions .",
    "these results are discussed from the perspective of galaxy evolution in clusters in  8 .",
    "we summarize our results and present our conclusions in  9 .",
    "a discussion of individual galaxies is given in the appendix .",
    "the sample consists of 13 peculiar virgo cluster spiral galaxies , spanning a variety of optical morphologies ( table @xmath5 , figure @xmath6 ) .",
    "morphological selection was made using the r and h@xmath4 atlas of virgo cluster galaxies of koopmann ( 2001 ) , whereas the kinematical selection made use of the published h@xmath4 kinematics on 89 virgo cluster spirals by rubin ( 1999 ) . while the sample selection is not uniform , it is designed to include bright virgo spirals whose peculiarities are most poorly understood , and to include representatives of the different h@xmath4 types identified by koopmann & kenney ( 2004 ) . in choosing sample galaxies within a given h@xmath4 type , we gave preference to those with kinematical peculiarities .",
    "in virgo spirals , there is a poor correlation between the bulge - to - disk ratio and the normalized star formation rate so that the hubble classification of spirals does not work well in the virgo cluster ( koopmann & kenney 1998 ) .",
    "the hubble type classification assigned to virgo galaxies generally reflects the star formation rate rather than the bulge - to - disk ratio , so that virgo spirals with reduced star formation rates are generally classified as early type spirals , independent of their bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "our sample includes more early type than late type galaxies , since most of the strongly disturbed cluster galaxies have reduced star formation rates and so are classified as early types . since the hubble classifications of cluster spirals do not capture the intrinsic variation in galaxy morphologies , either the distributions of old stellar light or the young stars , we use instead the light concentration parameter c@xmath7 ( abraham 1994 ) as an objective measure of the bulge - to - disk ratio , and the h@xmath4 type ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) , to describe the radial distribution of star formation .",
    "since h@xmath4 types seem to correlate with the type of interaction experienced by the galaxy ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) , and also to some kinematical properties that we describe in this paper , here we give brief definitions of these categories , and indicate in which category our sample galaxies belong .    * _ normal : _ ngc 4651 . in normal galaxies , the h@xmath4 radial distribution close to the mean of isolated spirals , both in the shape of the radial distribution ( which is close to the r light profile ) , and in amplitude . *",
    "_ truncated / normal : _ ngc 4351 , ngc 4457 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4580 . in truncated / normal galaxies , the h@xmath4 radial distribution like that in a normal galaxy out to a well - defined truncation radius , but there is virtually no h@xmath4 emission beyond . *",
    "_ truncated / compact : _ ngc 4064 , ngc 4424 , ngc 4606 , and ngc 4694 . in truncated / compact galaxies ,",
    "the h@xmath4 radial profile is much steeper than the r light profile at all radii , with a strong central peak , and a very sharp drop with radius , such that there is virtually no emission beyond the central  1 kpc . in koopmann",
    "& kenney ( 2004 ) this category also included the provision that the central h@xmath4 intensity was much higher than normal , but here we relax this provision . thus we include ngc 4694 in this category , which has an h@xmath4 radial profile like the other t / c galaxies , but with a lower amplitude . * _ anemic or truncated / anemic galaxies : _ ngc 4293 , ngc 4429 , ngc 4698 , and ngc 4450 . in anemic galaxies",
    "the shape of the h@xmath4 radial distribution is like that of a normal galaxy ( and like the r light profile ) , but with a much lower amplitude .",
    "anemic galaxies have weak but detectable emission over much of the stellar disk .",
    "truncated / anemic galaxies have an anemic distribution out to a well - defined truncation radius , but virtually no h@xmath4 emission beyond .",
    "whereas most of our sample galaxies in these categories have h@xmath4 emission detected out to at least  0.3r@xmath8 , we also include in the truncated / anemic category the s0 galaxy ngc 4429 , which has a very small and very weak h@xmath4 disk .",
    "distances to many individual early type virgo galaxies have now been measured to good accuracy , based on the surface brightness fluctuation method .",
    "the mean distance to early type virgo cluster galaxies is 16.5 @xmath9 0.1 mpc ( mei 2007 ) .",
    "the distances to late type and peculiar virgo galaxies are less accurately known .",
    "the commonly used tully - fisher method based on hi line - widths works well for most late type galaxies , but gives erroneous distances for a subset of cluster galaxies which are hi - poor and disturbed ( corts 2008 ) . in corts ( 2008 ) we derived distances to galaxies in the present virgo sample based on a new approach using a stellar kinematics - based version of the the tully - fisher relation .",
    "it is revealing to compare different distance estimates for perhaps the most disturbed galaxy in our sample , ngc 4424 .",
    "the hi - based tully - fisher method gives a distance of 4.8 mpc ( solanes 2002 ) , our stellar - kinematics - based tully - fisher relation gives a distance of 15.2 mpc ( corts 2008 ) , and a recent type ia supernova gives a distance of 15.5 mpc ( munari 2013 ) .",
    "while this is an extreme example , it illustrates that our stellar - kinematics - based tully - fisher distances may be relatively accurate .",
    "we adopt these distances in this paper , which are given in table @xmath5 .",
    "the galaxies were observed by using the densepak integral - field unit ( barden , sawyer & honeycutt 1998 ) installed at the 3.5 m wiyn telescope at kitt peak .",
    "the densepak array consists of 90 fibers with a diameter of 3.5 `` , and about 4 '' separation with a covering area of 30``@xmath1045 '' , which corresponds to 2.3@xmath103.5 kpc at the mean virgo distance .",
    "the observations were taken in three observing runs during april 8 - 9@xmath11 1999 , may 24 - 25@xmath11 2001 , and february 10 - 12@xmath11 2002 .",
    "the 860 line mm@xmath12 , blaze angle 30@xmath13.9 grating at 5000  was used at second order , covering the 45005500  wavelength range with a spectral dispersion of 0.48  per pixel , and a spectral resolution of 2.02  .",
    "the densepak array , in most of the cases , was oriented along the optical major axis of the galaxies ( table @xmath14 , fig .",
    "@xmath15 ) .",
    "details about the exposure time used to observe the galaxies are given in table @xmath14 .",
    "radial velocity standards stars ( barbier  brosat & figon 2000 ) were observed as spectral templates , with an exposure time of 180 seconds .",
    "details about each star are presented in table @xmath16 .",
    "the spectra were reduced in the usual way of iraf reduction for multi  fiber spectrographs .",
    "they were zero - subtracted and overscan corrected with the standard iraf tasks .",
    "the flat fielding correction , sky subtraction , fiber throughput correction , and wavelength calibration were carried out using the iraf task dohydra in the package hydra ( valds 1995 ) .",
    "alignment between different exposures was checked by comparing the continuum maps between each exposure . the exposures were aligned using our own program written in idl after the alignment , the galaxy spectra were averaged for improving signal - to - noise ratio and removing cosmic rays .    in two sample galaxies ; ngc 4424 and ngc 4351 , the spectra in many positions has a signal - to - noise ratio per pixel lower than limit for obtaining reliable kinematics until the second moment ( snr @xmath17 15 ) .",
    "therefore , spectra in these galaxies were binned using the adaptive scheme developed by cappellari & copin ( 2003 ) , for achieving a signal - to - noise ratio good enough for obtaining reliable kinematics .",
    "stellar kinematics of the sample galaxies , were derived by using the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method developed by cappellari & emsellem ( 2004 ) .",
    "this method allows the masking of emission lines , a more realistic estimation of errors than other methods , and automation , allowing us to derive the kinematics of many spectra in a relatively short amount of time .",
    "although , the method can measure the gauss - hermite moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) up to @xmath18 , the low signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra ( snr @xmath19 60 ) in most of our sample galaxies , only allow us to obtain reliable measurements until the velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we obtained gauss - hermite moments up to @xmath20 , only in 3 sample galaxies ; ngc 4429 , ngc 4450 , and ngc 4561 .",
    "template spectra were chosen from the spectra of observed radial velocity standard stars ( typically g & k giants ) which better fit the galaxy spectra .",
    "the ppxf method determines the broadening function ( losvd ) between the template star spectra and the galaxy spectra .",
    "if the instrumental dispersions between the template and the galaxy are different , we need to convolve the template spectra by the square root of the quadratic difference between the instrumental dispersion of the galaxy and the template star . since , we observed the template stars and sample galaxies using the same observational setup during the same observing runs , so the instrumental dispersions are the same for both , it was not necessary to convolve the template star , and the velocity dispersion derived is already corrected by instrumental dispersion .",
    "a linear combination of different template star did nt show any significant improvement in the fits .",
    "the heliocentric correction was applied to the derived line - of - sight velocities in each galaxy .",
    "errors were estimated by using a monte - carlo scheme .",
    "they were obtained as the standard deviation of the kinematical parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) from many realizations ( n=100 ) of the input spectra by adding gaussian noise to a model galaxy spectrum .",
    "comparison between the galaxy spectra in the central region , and the model galaxy spectra obtained by ppxf from the template star spectra are shown in fig . @xmath21 .",
    "two dimensional ionized gas kinematics were derived from the emission lines ( h@xmath2 and [ ] @xmath225007 ) by fitting a gaussian function to the emission lines in the continuum subtracted spectra , obtaining @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the ionized gas .",
    "finally we applied the heliocentric correction to the derived gas velocities . in this work ,",
    "we focus only on the ionized gas line - of - sight velocity .",
    "systemic velocities , kinematic position angles , and rotational velocities were obtained for each galaxy by fitting a pure circular tilted ring model ( begeman 1989 ) to the stellar and ionized gas velocity fields , in cases where this was possible .",
    "the method consists of dividing the galaxy into a set of concentric rings , each ring being characterised by a fixed value of the inclination @xmath23 , the rotation velocity @xmath24 and kinematic position angle @xmath25 .",
    "we define the sky coordinates @xmath26 as the densepak array coordinates with @xmath27 oriented over the position angle of the densepak array @xmath28 ( see table @xmath14 ) . for a given ring ,",
    "the observed radial velocities recorded on a set of sky - coordinates are given by ;    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the galaxy , measured from the optical major axis of the galaxy .",
    "it can be shown that for any point @xmath31 in the plane of the galaxy , @xmath30 is given by ;    @xmath32 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    @xmath33 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the mean radius of the ring in the plane of the galaxy , and @xmath35 are the sky coordinates of the center of the ring . in this work ,",
    "we define position angle ( either optical or kinematic ) as the angle between the optical / kinematic major axis of the galaxy , and the line from the galaxy center headed north , measured from the north to east .",
    "the procedure is iterative , and described as follows : 1 ) we divide the galaxy into concentric rings with typical widths of one fiber on the major axis .",
    "2 ) for each ring , we make a least - square fit of @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 as free parameters , keeping fixed @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "then , we took as center coordinates and systemic velocity the mean values over the all the rings .",
    "3 ) after this , we kept fixed  @xmath37 and @xmath39 , and we fitted the values @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , simultaneously .",
    "we did nt attempt to fit the inclination @xmath23 as it was difficult to disentangle the degeneracy between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , so we kept this parameter fixed for all the rings to its optical value as derived from koopmann 2001 .",
    "4 ) the improved values define a new systemic velocity @xmath39 and set of sky coordinates @xmath37 .",
    "repeat 2 ) and 3 ) with these parameters until convergence is obtained .    on average , we have 6 degrees of freedom in each annuli .",
    "we are aware that points close to the minor axis carry less information about the rotational velocity , so we used a weighting function of @xmath40 , in order to give more weight to points close to the major axis .",
    "stellar rotation curves were obtained for all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "kinematic parameters derived from the stellar velocities are presented in table @xmath41 .",
    "stellar rotation curves are not corrected by asymmetric drift , since this is beyond of the scope of this paper .",
    "this correction requires the solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "stellar circular velocities for these galaxies are presented in cortes ( 2008 ) .",
    "the case of ngc 4064 was complicated since this galaxy has a strong central bar , and a model based on a pure circular disk is not fully justified , but this approach is useful for separating the circular streaming component from the radial streaming component .",
    "we obtained ionized gas rotation curves for six galaxies in the sample .",
    "we were unable to fit a pure circular tilted ring model to the ionized gas velocity fields for some galaxies due to scarcity of emission ( e.g. ngc 4424 , ngc 4606 or ngc 4694 ) , or large non - circular motions ( e.g. ngc 4064 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 4457 ) .",
    "however , systemic ionized gas velocities were estimated for all the galaxies , either by taking the mean of the averaged los velocities at the same radius on opposite sides along the major axis , or by considering the los velocity at the position of the peak of the stellar continuum map .",
    "the kinematic parameters derived from ionized gas velocities are presented in table @xmath42 .    in some of our galaxies ,",
    "the optical and/or kinematic position angles vary with radius , or there are misalignments between the optical and/or kinematic position angles .",
    "we discuss these variations in section 5.1 .",
    "eight galaxies in our sample have published stellar kinematic data from other groups . in general the results",
    "are consistent , given the difference in spatial resolution between our densepak data ( 3.5 `` ) and that for the other groups ( 0.6''1.2 \" ) .",
    "four galaxies have published long - slit stellar kinematics : ngc 4429 ( simien & prugniel 1997 ) , ngc 4450 and ngc 4569 ( fillmore 1986 ) , and ngc 4698 ( hraudeau 1999 , bertola 1999 ) . comparison of our data with those from these groups for the los velocity and velocity dispersion along the major axis is shown in fig .",

    "since they did nt publish any information about their errors , we do nt know if the differences are significant . in the case of ngc 4569 , the fillmore data exhibit a peak in the stellar velocity at 3 \" that we do nt resolve due to our lower spatial resolution .",

    "active stripping is easier to identify in highly - inclined galaxies , since a clear spatial separation of gas and stars can be seen ( kenney 2004 ; crowl 2005 ; abramson 2011 ) . in relatively face - on galaxies ,",
    "a comparison of stellar and gas kinematics is a good way to identify ongoing ram pressure stripping .",
    "ram pressure acts only on gas , so in a galaxy affected by ram pressure , the kinematics of the gas is disturbed , but those of the older stars is not . if however star formation occurs in gas disturbed by ram pressure , the stellar kinematics of the newly - formed stars would be disturbed , so the intensity - weighted stellar kinematics ( including both young and old stars ) could also be disturbed .",
    "recent ( e.g. , kronberger 2008 ) , combined n - body / hydrodynamic simulations have shown that icm ",
    "ism stripping has distinctive effects on the gas velocity fields , which become distorted . in the case",
    "face - on stripping , velocity fields look disturbed in the outer parts and undisturbed in the inner parts of the disk . as the inclination of the galaxy becomes more edge - on , the disturbance in the gas velocity field increases and it becomes asymmetric , with a mismatch between the gas kinematic center and the stellar disk center .",
    "some of our sample galaxies display features in their ionized gas velocity fields which may indicate ram pressure .",
    "ngc 4457 displays a stellar velocity field largely consistent with rotation , but an asymmetric ionized gas velocity field indicating non - circular gas motions .",
    "there is an apparent bending in the gas isovelocity contours on the southern side of the galaxy , and gas velocities are 30 - 40 @xmath57 lower than the stellar velocities .",
    "this bending is also visible in the more detailed and extended map presented by chemin ( 2006 ) .",
    "also , its gas kinematic center does nt seem to coincide with the optical center of the stellar disk , although the gas kinematic center is not well determined .",
    "moreover , it presents a peculiar h@xmath4 arm .",
    "ism stripping simulations ( e.g. schulz & struck 2001 ) , show that this feature can be created in galaxies tilted with respect to the icm wind .",
    "overall , the disturbed gas kinematics and anomalous h@xmath4 arm suggest active ram pressure stripping in ngc  4457 .",
    "ngc 4351 is lopsided , as the starlight in the central @xmath17  30 \" is significantly offset from the centroid of outer disk isophotes .",
    "much of the central starlight arise from strong star formation with an irregular pattern . otherwise , there are no obvious disturbances in the light distribution of the outer galaxy , which lacks star formation .",
    "the stellar velocity field is generally consistent with a rotation pattern ( fig .",
    "@xmath48 ) , except that all the isovelocity contours curve toward the sw .",
    "while not all of the features which deviate from a pure rotation pattern are real , the unusual curvature toward the sw may be real .",
    "a similar pattern is observed with high significance in both ionized gas velocity fields ( fig .",
    "@xmath48 ) , as well as the hi velocity field ( chung 2009 ) .",
    "it remains unclear whether this apparently similar disturbance to the stellar and gas velocity fields is due to a tidal interaction or ram pressure .",
    "while ram pressure does nt affect stars , much of the stellar light we are measuring in this region could be from young stars which formed in gas disturbed by ram pressure .",
    "the hi distribution shows compressed contours to the ne , and extended , tail - like distribution to the sw ( chung 2009 ) . similarly , the peak in ionized gas intensities is in the ne .",
    "all these features may be consistent with ongoing ram pressure from the ne .",
    "ngc 4580 has a sharply truncated gas disk within a relatively normal looking stellar disk .",
    "its high v/@xmath1 ratio confirms that the stellar disk is undisturbed .",
    "its ionized gas velocity field looks symmetric and undistorted , indicating that strong ram pressure is not presently acting on the galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath4 image of the galaxy shows a prominent star forming ring at the gas truncation radius ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) .",
    "this could be a case of `` annealing '' ( schulz & struck 2001 ) , where some of the outer disk gas has lost angular momentum and forms a dense gas ring at the truncation radius which makes the remaining gas more resistant to stripping .",
    "ngc 4569 may be the clearest case of ongoing ram pressure stripping in our sample , although our kinematic data do nt show anything obviously related to this since the telltale evidence is beyond the central field of view we studied .",
    "it has a sharply truncated gas disk within a relatively normal stellar disk , as well as an anomalous extraplanar arm of hi gas with star - forming regions which may be falling back into the galaxy .",
    "vollmer ( 2004 ) make the case that ngc4569 is in a post - peak pressure phase , after closest approach .",
    "the kinematic peculiarities we find in the central part of ngc 4569 reflects a nuclear outflow , and is not directly related to the ram pressure stripping .",
    "the kinematic peculiarities of the sample galaxies are difficult to explain by internal mechanisms , and are presumably due to interactions within the cluster or circumcluster environment .",
    "can these peculiarities be caused by a sole mechanism , or do we need more than one mechanism acting independently for explain them ? in order to answer these questions , we focus on the probable scenarios for the galaxy peculiarities suggested by the stellar and ionized gas kinematics for all the sample galaxies ; + in appendix a we give a detailed discussion on the kinematics of each sample galaxy and in table @xmath136 we summarize the kinematic and morphological indicators of interactions for each galaxy , and give our best guess for the types of interactions that the galaxies have experienced .",

    "all but one of our galaxies , ngc 4651 , are very gas poor ( chung 2009 ) and may have experienced gas stripping .",
    "several of these galaxies show clear or possible evidence for ongoing or past stripping based on hi mapping ( chung 2009 ) , but not from our data .    among the most intriguing objects in our sample are those four galaxies with truncated / compact h@xmath4 morphologies .",

    "the only one of the four with a prominent bulge , ngc  4694 , has a central dip in its velocity dispersion , suggesting a young circumnuclear stellar disk .",

    "the detailed type of gravitational interaction is not as as clear in ngc 4606 and ngc 4064 , but their kinematic properties suggest intermediate - mass ratio mergers or close tidal encounters .",
    "these galaxies have probably also experienced icm - ism stripping since they are gas - poor , have very truncated hi and h@xmath4 disks , and in the case of ngc 4424 an hi tail ( chung 2007 ; chung 2009 ) .",

    "ngc  4429 , with its misaligned central stellar and dust disk , and the tail in its losvd , is likely an old merger due to the lack of gas observed in this galaxy , which probably was consumed in the subsequent star formation that formed the kinematically distinct core .",

    "ngc  4694 , with its central sigma drop and evidence for a young central stellar disk , plus the clearly disturbed hi , has likely experienced accretion or a partial merger with the dwarf galaxy it is currently interacting with . while it does nt have a kinematically distinct core , the disturbed outer disk of ngc  4651 clearly implicates a recent minor merger , and the the prominent tail in its stellar losvd at r=10 - 20@xmath67 suggests that the merger has affected the inner galaxy .",

    "the ionized gas intensity maps show emission within the central 10 \" .",
    "the nucleus is relatively strong , and there are fainter features extending to the nw and sw of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "@xmath150 ) .",
    "the ionized gas velocity fields appear disturbed . along the major axis ,",
    "ionized gas velocities are systematically lower by 25 @xmath57 than the stars , and in places show large velocity gradients .",
    "+ * ngc 4698 : * this remarkable galaxy ngc 4698 has a bulge that rotates orthogonally with respect to the disk ( bertola 1999 ) .",
    "the disk appears undisturbed , suggesting that this galaxy is the product of an ancient merger .",
    "the stellar velocity field shows at least two distinct kinematical components ( fig .",
    "@xmath150 ) .",
    "the inner 10 `` exhibits s - shaped isovelocity contours near the minor axis , due to the orthogonally rotating core .",
    "the effect is less evident that in previously published data ( bertola 1999 ) , due to the smoothing effect introduced by the width of the fibers . in the outer 10 '' ,",
    "the velocity field is consistent with a rotation pattern in most respects , except that the isovelocity contours are concave .",
    "these concave contours mean that the line - of - sight velocity increases as we going outwards from the major axis , which is probably due to the effect of the orthogonally rotating bulge .",
    "this galaxy exhibits almost no stellar rotation within the inner 10 `` . beyond the inner 10 '' ,",
    "the los stellar velocities rise dramatically , due to the increasing influence of the stellar disk .",
    "h@xmath2 emission was not detected .",
    "on the contrary , [ ] emission is very strong in the center and detected over the entire array ( fig .",
    "@xmath150 ) .",
    "the [ ] velocity field is well - ordered , but very different from the stellar velocity field .",
    "the pattern seems largely consistent with rotation , although with a pa which changes with increasing radius , from 120@xmath13 at the center to 150@xmath13 at 25 `` .",
    "( in order to produce the [ ] rotation curve in figure @xmath54 , we used rings with different p.as . ) in the inner @xmath79 5 '' , the [ ] kinematic pa is roughly perpendicular to the local stellar kinematic pa . at @xmath7925 \" ,",
    "the pas are offset by @xmath1720 @xmath13 .",
    "we suspect that the gas distribution is non - planar , as the equilibrium plane of the gas is expected to gradually change from larger radii , where the outer disk dominates the gravitational potential , to smaller radii , where the orthogonally rotating bulge dominates the potential .",
