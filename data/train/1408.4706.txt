    "the transport through molecules as small as benzene @xcite or as long as dna @xcite or carbon nanotubes @xcite falls into the realm of molecular electronics .",
    "this field of research has a long history @xcite , dating back to 1956 @xcite . as a consequence of this latter paper and of the immediate perception of its importance the usa air force decided , already by that time , to fund this type of research @xcite .",
    "according to cuevas and scheer @xcite molecular electronics is the field of research devoted to the study of the electronic and thermal transport through individual molecules .",
    "the objective of this type of research is to produce electronic devices where the building blocks are single molecules , exploring the quantum mechanical properties that necessarily appear at this small length scales .",
    "this type of devices include : switches , sensors , diodes , transistors , and other @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another advantage of this approach is that it opens the door to the discovery of new quantum phenomena . in this sense",
    ", one should remember that , historically , technological breakthroughs were often a natural consequence of the explorations of new areas , and not its finality . from a technological point of view",
    ", there are several advantages in pursuing the study of molecular electronics when compared to the present silicon technology , namely @xcite :    * size .",
    "molecules have typical sizes ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 nm , which allows the construction of functional nano - structures with subsequent advantages in cost , efficiency and power dissipation . *",
    "estimations show that a good molecular wire could , for example , reduce the transit time of a traditional transistor , around @xmath2 s , hence obtaining faster operations . *",
    "new functionalities . as an example , many molecules have several stable geometric structures , or isomers , that may have different electronic or optic properties , what can be an advantage for the development of some devices , such as switches or sensors . * synthetic tailorability . by changing ,",
    "for example , the composition or the geometry of a system , one can obtain specific transport or optical properties suitable for a specific end .",
    "however , we need not only to know which molecules are the best for a certain usage , but also how to connect them , namely through unidimensional ( 1d ) nanowires .",
    "we shall focus now on the composition of these nanowires , rather than on how to create them ( for that , see , for example [ @xcite ] ) .    historically , the carbon - based molecules always played an important role in the field of molecular electronics , due to its high versatility .",
    "carbon is the basis of a wide range of structures , since tridimensional , like diamonds or graphite , to bidimensional , like graphene , ( quasi)unidimensional , like the nanotubes , or even ( quasi)zero - dimensional , like the fullerenes . in particular , the carbon nanotubes can be used to connect individual molecules .",
    "also , some experiments on quantum transport through carbon nanotubes have already been performed @xcite .",
    "another very important class of systems , related to the previous one , are the hydrocarbons .",
    "the importance of this class is that such molecules can have different transport properties depending on the degree of hybridization of the molecular orbitals of its carbon atoms .",
    "if the valence electrons are @xmath3 hybridized , there is a tetrahedral arrangement of the bonds in space .",
    "this is the case of the alkanes , with the sum formula @xmath4 [ the simplest alkane , the ethane , is presented in figure [ fig : hydrocarbons](a ) ] .",
    "since each valence electron is used for the formation a different ( single ) chemical bond , they are basically localized , and thus the alkanes are insulating . on the other hand , the valence electrons may also be @xmath5 or @xmath6 hybridized , forming , respectively , alkenes , with double bonds , and alkynes , with triple bonds [ the simplest of each kind , the ethylene and the acethylene , are presented in figure [ fig : hydrocarbons](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "a particular case of these occurs when double or triple bonds are alternated with single bonds .",
    "these molecules are very stable and give rise to delocalized wave functions , which makes them good conductors .",
    "[ fig : ethane ]     [ fig : ethylene ]     [ fig : acetylene ]    \\(a ) ethane .",
    "\\(b ) ethylene .",
    "\\(c ) acetylene .",
    "another advantage of these organic molecules is that they can assume different geometries .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : polyenes ] are presented two polyenes with six carbon atoms each . due to their atoms @xmath5 hybridization , they tend to make 120@xmath7 angles between bonds .",
    "when the angles are built to alternate sides , the polyene has a zigzag shape [ hexatriene , figure [ fig : polyenes](a ) ] .",
    "however , when all angles are built to the same side , the polyene has a cyclic shape [ benzene , figure [ fig : polyenes](b ) ] . in the particular case of the benzene",
    ", there is a fully delocalized double bond , which makes this molecule a good conductor .",
    "this is the motivation of our study of the transport through a benzene ring .",
    "[ fig : hexatriene ]     [ fig : benzene ]    \\(a ) hexatriene .",
    "\\(b ) benzene .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical introduction to molecular electronics , studying the electronic transport through a benzene ring , using the formalism of green s functions .",
    "the transport through quantum rings has been considered in the literature before @xcite , but the approach used can not be easily generalized to more complex problems . on the other hand , the green s function approach is the method of choice when the complexity of the problem increases .",
    "the use of the green s function method to describe impurity states in a tight - binding models has also been considered @xcite .",
    "the effect of phonons on transport across a benzene molecule has also been considered using green s function methods @xcite .",
    "the paper is written with the graduate students in mind .",
    "the method of green s function is often considered a difficult one , casting a way many students from its study .",
    "here we show , by two examples of moderate complexity , that this is not the case .",
    "these two problems are solved analytically , which , to our best knowledge has not been solved in the literature before using the given method . indeed ,",
    "although , there are many books on quantum transport , none give a detailed discussion of problems of moderate complexity .",
    "typically , they solve the one - dimension tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "the same happens with review articles @xcite .",
    "we thus consider that the solution of this problem is a valuable addition to the literature .",
    "the resonant level system is the simplest example of molecular electronics displaying non - trivial transport properties ( this model also describes the transport through a single quantum level @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce the formalism used in the next section for describing electronic transport through a benzene molecule with a _ hands - on _ philosophy by solving the resonant level system using green s functions .",
    "this approach will benefit the students wanting to have a working knowledge of the method .    to explain the basics of the green s functions formalism ,",
    "let us consider a problem that can be described by a hamiltonian written in the form @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10    let us also consider that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are such that they can be related by @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the scattered component of the wave . from the previous equations , one can easily find the lippmann - schwinger equation , of the form @xmath15 where we define the free green s function operator as @xcite @xmath16 this definition is obtained naturally except for the term @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a infinitesimal positive real number .",
    "this term is added to the definition to guarantee that this operator describes a wave propagating from the left to the right .",
    "furthermore , one can replace the term @xmath12 on right hand side of the lippmann - schwinger equation ( [ eq : green3:lippmann1 ] ) with itself obtaining by iteration @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the full green s function operator , that can be defined as @xmath21 the advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : green3:lippmann2 ] ) is that only the known wave function @xmath11 enters in it .",
    "recalling the explicit definition of @xmath22 , given in ( [ eq : green3:greenfunction1 ] ) , the previous equation can be simplified to @xmath23 which results in a definition analogue to that of @xmath22 except that now the full hamiltonian enters in the definition , and with @xmath18 having the same meaning as before . however , neither of the two previous definitions of @xmath20 are very useful , since both of them involve inversions of operators , which can be difficult .",
    "fortunately , the green s function operator can yet be written in a third form , through a taylor expansion of the term @xmath24 in ( [ eq : green3:greenfunction2 ] ) . in doing so",
    ", one reaches dyson s equation @xmath25 its usefulness will be proven further in the text .",
    "the key aspect of this method is to use the previous relations in order to obtain , in the end , an expression of the form    = [ eq : green3:sistema1 ] c ( e^i k a n + r e^-i k a n ) , & @xmath26 , [ eq : green3:sistema1_r ] + c ( e^i k a n ) , & @xmath27 .",

    ", it is possible to obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are respectively the reflection and transmission amplitudes , such that the reflectance and transmittance through some defect , quantum dot , or molecule are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33    we now proceed to the study of the resonant level system",
    ". this problem will be useful to illustrate the previously described method in a situation where the solution is non - trivial ( in general , textbooks tend to describe only trivial examples which produce some discomfort on the students ) . to start with ,",
    "let us define the system we ought to study .",
    "this is composed of two semi - finite 1d chains , with @xmath34 atoms each , and a different atom in between them  which we shall call the defect .",
    "the distance between each atom and its nearest two neighbours is @xmath35 . in both 1d chains , the hopping energy between two first neighbours",
    "is @xmath36 , whereas the hopping energy between higher order neighbours is zero .",
    "however , due to the presence of the defect , we shall consider that , on the one hand , the hopping energies around the defect are different from @xmath36 and are different in both sides of it ",
    "being @xmath37 to the left and @xmath38 to the right  , and , on the other hand , there is an on - site energy on the position of the defect ( @xmath39 ) , with value @xmath40 . in figure",
    "[ fig : onelevelresonant ] there is a schematic representation of the described system .",

    "this means that at @xmath46 the unperturbed wave function must read     0 , & @xmath27 , [ eq : green3:psi0r ]    where @xmath47 is such that @xmath48 where @xmath47 plays the role of @xmath11 in the formalism described above .",
    "hence , to apply the previously described method , we must find @xmath47 .",
    "it can be written , in general , in a basis composed by every position state available , that is , @xmath49 where we do not know yet the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "however , we can use this result , as well as the definition of @xmath51 given in ( [ eq : green3:hl ] ) , and replace them in ( [ eq : schropsil ] ) . multiplying both sides of the resulting equation with the position state @xmath52 ( @xmath53 )",

    "it should be clear that ( [ eq : green3:schrodinger1 ] ) becomes general if we introduce the condition @xmath57 where it is assumed that @xmath34 will tend to infinite in the of the calculation .",
    "on the other hand , we can consider that the flux must be composed by the sum of two plane waves , one travelling forward and the other travelling backward , which means that the coefficients @xmath50 must have the form @xmath58 where @xmath28 and @xmath59 are constants and @xmath60 is the wave vector of the plane waves .",
    "from these two conclusions , one finds that @xmath61 and , also , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is some integer value between @xmath0 and @xmath34 . through further normalization of the wave function , one finally obtains @xmath64 and also , from the ( [ eq : green3:psi0 ] ) , @xmath65 if @xmath26 , and zero otherwise .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to find , from ( [ eq : green3:schrodinger1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c(m ) ] ) , that the allowed stationary energies of this problem are given by @xmath66    in analogue way , it is also possible to show that for the 1d chain to the right of the defect the eigenstates of @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 and the allowed stationary energies are equally given by ( [ eq : green3:psil ] ) . for this case , @xmath60 is defined as before , see ( [ eq : k1d ] )",

    "we then studied the case of the benzene system , and presented plots of its transmittance and reflectance , for different sets of parameters . here",
    ", the plots obtained for the transmittance were much more complex , depending on four parameters , which means that a study like the one presented for the resonant level system above is much more difficult to elaborate .",
    "indeed , it would require an extensive study of the limits of the transmittance and reflectance for several values of the presented parameters , and also the production of much more plots than the ones presented here , what would worth of paper of itself .",
    "our goal was rather to show that the green s function method an easily be applied to a problem of moderate difficulty .",
    "the same can be said about the local density of states in each atom of the benzene ring , which was also calculated in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , some qualitative aspects can be drawn from the results of fig .",

    "taking the single example of panel ( h ) of that figure we seen that the transmittance is strongly suppressed for values of the energy such that @xmath164 .",

    "this method , as should now be clear , can be easily generalized to more complex problems , such as a chain of atoms , like a polyacetylene , or two ( or more ) benzene rings in a row .",
    "however , we can conclude that the analytical expressions of the found quantities , although possible to find through this method , can get rather complex when the complexity of the problem increases , due to the increase of the number of atoms involved in the calculation . in this case",
    ", the method can be formulated using efficient numerical methods .    in synthesis , as should now be obvious , the green s functions method is ideal for tackling transport problems in molecular electronics , providing , in many cases , analytical expressions for the quantum transmittance , which can further be analysed in detail for the benefit of gaining insight on the transport properties of a given system .",
    "in this appendix , we present the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath167 of the free green s function operator for the resonant level system . these elements are given by @xmath168    where @xmath169 , defined as in ( [ eq : green3:hl])([eq : green3:hr ] ) .",
