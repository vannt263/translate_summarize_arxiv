    "the different ways to form a supermassive black hole may apply to different redshifts or environments .",
    "a rapid growth of seed black holes is quite a promising model to issue the formation of supermassive black holes at redshift @xmath13 ( volonteri & rees 2005 ) .",

    "the disk s radius scale is @xmath38 .",
    "the emergent spectrum from the slim disk is characterized by a universe shape of @xmath60 ( wang & zhou 1999 , wang et al .",
    "1999 , see also shimura & manmoto 2003 , kawaguchi 2003 ) , the hard x - ray emission is highly dependent on the factor @xmath61 , which indicates how many energy is released in the hot corona ( wang & netzer 2003 , chen & wang 2004 , hereafter , socrates & davis 2005 ) .",
    "even @xmath62 , the released energy from hot corona is close to eddington limit .",
    "the physics related with the factor @xmath61 remains open .",
    "the compton temperature reads @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath65 is the mean energy of photons from the disk which depend on @xmath66 .",
    "the mean energy of the photons are in a range of @xmath67kev for @xmath68 ( wang & netzer 2003 ) .",
    "we take the lower value @xmath69kev , so the medium will be heated up to @xmath70k at least .",
    "it should be pointed out that the higher the compton temperature is , the stronger the feedback from the tiny accretion disk has influence on its surroundings .",
    "the radiation pressure acting on the medium inside the bondi accretion sphere is of order @xmath71 , where the thomson scattering depth is @xmath72 and @xmath73 is thomson cross section .",
    "we find the ratio of @xmath74 , beyond the radius @xmath75 , the radiation pressure is negligible , where @xmath76 . since the photon trapping effects , the radiated luminosity from the highly super - critical accretion disk is lower than eddington limit by a factor of 3 ( see equation 6 ) .",
    "so radiation pressure hardly prevents the infalling matter from accretion onto the black hole .",
    "the feedback from the radiation pressure is negligible .",
    "the bondi flow will be heated by the radiation from the tiny accretion disk . in turn",
    ", the heated medium determines a new bondi accretion rate switched on the tiny disk .",
    "the thermal status of the photoionized medium can be conveniently described by the ionization parameter defined as @xmath77 ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) .",
    "we focus on a region with @xmath78 ( for pure hydrogen gas ) , here @xmath79 , where the entire medium will be heated up to compton temperature @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from @xmath81 which is called the compton radius ( and sphere ) .",
    "it needs a compton timescale @xmath82 to form such a compton sphere .",
    "however the compton sphere is also constrained by the balance of the heating and infalling timescale of the bondi flow .",
    "it follows from @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the infalling velocity of the bondi flow normalized by the sound speed and @xmath86 .",
    "the effects of the infalling on the compton sphere can be neglected if the infalling velocity is less than @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "we find @xmath89 .",
    "this means that _ not _ entire region with @xmath90 can be heated up to the compton temperature ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "so the compton radius is given by @xmath91 , corresponding to a timescale of @xmath5yr .",
    "we note that @xmath92 kpc .    within the compton sphere",
    ", the seed black hole has a new bondi accretion radius @xmath93 and a bondi accretion rate , @xmath94 we note that this radius is still much larger than the tiny disk @xmath54 and this accretion rate is much smaller than that in the pre - feedbacked .",
    "the timescale of the compton heating at @xmath95 is @xmath96yr .",
    "that is to say the beginning bondi accretion will be halted suddenly .",
    "after the termination of the super - critical accretion , the hot plasma in bondi sphere ii will be cooled at a timescale of @xmath97yr via free - free emission , where @xmath98 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore it is expected that there is a steady accretion onto the seed black hole , but with a sub - eddington rate , which is self - regulated .",
    "when the compton sphere forms , the pressure balance with its surroundings should hold , we have @xmath99 , where the subscript @xmath100 and @xmath101 represent compton sphere and its pre - feedbacked surroundings , respectively .",
    "so we can get the bondi accretion rate @xmath102 inside the compton sphere in the form of @xmath29 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "with such a low accretion rate , the seed black hole can not grow significantly .    since @xmath107 ,",
    "the accretion onto the black hole from the bondi sphere i is continuing , then the matter will pile up between the region of @xmath108 .",
    "such a dense shell will collapse when pressures are not powerful enough to balance it .",
    "thus the accretion onto the seed black holes could be pulsive with a period .",
    "however , the oscillating accretion will be avoided if the outflow is supplied .",
    "wind / outflow is a generic property of the accretion disk .",
    "there are many pieces of evidence for the presence of strong outflows from accretion disks . in the quasar",
    "pg 1211 + 143 , the outflow is indicated by the blueshifted x - ray absorption lines with a velocity of @xmath109 and has an outflow mass rate @xmath110 ( pounds et al .",
    "similar strong outflows are found in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( mukai et al .",
    "2003 , fabbiano et al . 2003 ) and ss 433 which clearly has strong outflows ( @xmath111 ) from the highly super - critical accretion disk ( kotani et al .",
    "a strong outflow is expected to develop from the tiny accretion disk , leading to efficient kinetic feedback to its surroundings . here",
    "we neglect the detailed micro - physics of the interaction between outflow and medium .",
    "the kinetic luminosity is given by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the fraction of the outflow to the accretion rate and we take @xmath114 .",
    "the simple energy budget can provide a rough estimation of the outflow kinetic energy .",
    "when the outflow is damped by its surroundings , its most kinetic energy will dissipate at the sonic radius @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the temperature of the surroundings ( begelman 2004 ) .",
    "this radius is much smaller than the characterized radius of the fat disk ( @xmath117 ) , but it is comparable to the inner quasi - spheric part of the cold fat disk .",
    "the kinetic luminosity ( @xmath118 ) can compensate the free - free radiation loss of the hot plasma within the radius @xmath119 . for a typical outflow ,",
    "the timescale of reaching the sonic point is @xmath120yr .",
    "it would be interesting to note that this feedback timescale is much shorter than the compton heating in the present case .",
    "we could draw a conclusion that the kinetic feedback from the outflow does play an important role in the growth of the seed hole .",
    "on the other hand , the mass loss through the strong outflow definitely prevents the seed holes from growth .",
    "however the mass rate of the outflow is uncertain , we do not know exactly how the growth of the seed holes is affected via mass loss .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that we use the self - similar solutions of the super - eddington accretion ( wang & zhou 1999 ) based on the slim disk ( abramowicz et al 1988 ) .",
    "the super - critical accretion remains a matter of debate since there are several instabilities , especially the photon bubble instability ( gammie 1998 ) .",
    "the instability results in inhomogeneity of the disk , allowing the trapped photons to escape from the disk and enhance the disk radiation . if we employ the radiation leakage model at a level of @xmath121 ( begelman 2002 ) , the feedback will be much stronger than we have discussed above .",
    "thus the results from the present paper is a lower limit of feedback .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the radiation is isotropic from the tiny accretion disk",
    ". the anisotropic radiation from the slim disk could suppress the compton heating in some degrees .",
    "the self - similar solution gives the ratio of the height to the radius @xmath122 , where @xmath11 is the viscosity parameter ( wang & zhou 1999 ) .",
    "the half - opening angle is about @xmath123 , the radiation will be confined within @xmath124 of the @xmath125 solid angle .",
    "this assumption is reasonable .",
    "however the anisotropic radiation from the tiny disk may lower the feedback of the compton heating .",
    "future work will consider how the anisotropy effects the feedback for a time - dependent situation , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "there are other possible ways to form supermassive black holes .",
    "the direct collapse of primordial clouds in which the angular momentum is removed by the cosmic background photons ( loeb 1993 , loeb & rassio 1994 ) can form a @xmath126 black hole at @xmath127 .",
    "if the seed black hole accrets dark matter , its growth is not suffering from the strong feedback ( hu et al .",
    ". the inevitable fate of a compact cluster is the formation of a supermassive black hole ( quinlan & shapiro 1990 ) .",
    "these possible ways might apply to different environments in the universe , it depends on future observations to test them .",
    "we show that the feedback of the radiation pressure , compton heating and outflows from the super - critical accretion disks will result in strong influence on the accretion itself .",
    "we show that the compton heating almost quenches the super - critical accretion and the outflow from the tiny disk heats up the outer region so that accumulation of matter is avoided .",
    "a rapid growth of seed black holes is greatly suppressed and they are hardly able to grow up unless the strong feedback can be avoided , for example considering the anisotropy of the radiation from the tiny accretion disk .",
