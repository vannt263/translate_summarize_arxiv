    "corot has been a 27 cm diameter space telescope equipped with four ccd - cameras .",
    "two of them were used for observing a dozen of pulsational and other kinds of light variations of bright stars with high time - sampling ( so - called asteroseismological channel ) , while other two ccds were used to search for transit signals of about 6000 stars per ccd ( so - called exo - channel ) . in the exo - channel",
    "there were biprisms in front of the ccds which produced a low ( @xmath0 ) resolution spectra for each stars .",
    "this avoided the saturation of many stars , and like defocusing , helped to increase the signal - to - nois ratio .",
    "because of available telemetry rate , most of the photometric masks of the pre - selected stars were read - out in every 512 seconds , but a few hundred stars had a flux measurement in every 32 seconds as well as for a few hundred stars different parts of the photometric masks were read - out separately , yielding the so - called corot - blue , -green and -red light curves . for details see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but due to this technique , the point spread function of corot s exo - channel was typically 80@xmath120 arcseconds and was varying from star to star",
    ". therefore nearby stars in the frame can pollute the observed stars , spreading a certain amount of their flux inside the photometric mask .",
    "such a polluting star is called contaminating star in corot - terminology .",
    "the process how to determine which star is contaminating and how much is described in @xcite and @xcite , for instance .",
    "however , in those calculations the contaminating star is considered as a constant star .",
    "if it is variable then it is possible that a contaminating source is a foreground or background eclipsing binary and small amount of its light is contaminating the main target , causing a false positive as a diluted , small transit - like signal in the corot - target .",
    "therefore additional , ground - based , higher spatial resolution photometry is necessary to filter out such cases .",
    "@xcite describes how different kinds of such photometric studies help to decide about the true nature of the observed corot transit signals .",
    "our previous @xcite and present works reports our contribution to this as well as reports the detected variables and their basic properties .",
    "future studies on corot light curves can utilize these data to remove the variability stemming from a possible contaminator .    beyond the much better angular resolution",
    "the main advantage of our data is the different epoch of the observation . for periodic sources ( e.g. eclipsing binaries , planetary candidates ) this helps to determine a more accurate period , while for non - periodic sources a much longer observation is abailable , which is helpful to describe the nature of the light variation .    in this paper",
    "we present our independent study on the variable stars in the direction of the corot field src02 detected by best ii .",
    "section  [ data ] presents the observations and the description of the telescope used . in section  [ variable_stars ]",
    "we present the variable star selection method and the description of the classification scheme .",
    "the previously known and the newly detected variable stars are in section  [ firstresults ] . in section  [ binaries ]",
    "we present the fitted models of nine selected eclipsing binaries .",
    "eventually the summary and conclusions of this paper can be found in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the observations were performed with the best ii telescope located at the universittssternwarte bochum near observatorio cerro armazones , chile .",
    "the system consists of a takahashi 25 cm baker - ritchey - chrtien telescope equipped with a 4k @xmath1 4k finger lakes ccd .",
    "the corresponding field of view is @xmath2 with an angular resolution of @xmath3 pixel@xmath4 . in order to maximize the photon yield and to get more accurate photometry of the fainter stars",
    "no filter was used .",
    "the exposure time was 120s for all the images .",
    "best ii observed the corot target field src02 during a total of 32 nights between 2009 may 4 and 2009 july 28 .",
    "an illustration of the best ii and the corot field src02 is shown in figure [ fig : field ] .",
    "@xmath5 of the corot field is covered by best ii , which was centered on the coordinates : @xmath6    the acquired observations were processed using the best automated photometric pipeline as described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting datasets consist of 1,307 observations of 86,944 stellar objects .",
    "note that corot observed 11,408 targets in src02 field , which is much less than the targets observed by best ii .",
    "the most important difference is the target selection . instead of observing all targets down to a certain magnitude limit ,",
    "corot observed a pre - selected sample of stars optimized for tranziting planet detection and stellar pulsation studies .",
    "best ii has much better angular resolution than corot , which has a point spread function of @xmath7 , however , the typical number of best ii objects in a corot psf is only 1 - 3 .",
    "another important difference is the limiting magnitude which is @xmath82 - 3 magnitudes deeper for our current survey .",
    "all stars are matched with the ucac3 catalog ( zacharias et al .",
    "2010 ) in order to assign equatorial coordinates and to adjust instrumental magnitudes to a standard magnitude system .",
    "the astrometric calibration achieves an average residual of 0.23 arcsecond .",
    "the magnitude calibration is obtained by shifting each data set by the median difference between all instrumental magnitudes and their respective catalog value ( r2mag of ucac3 ) .",
    "since the photometric systems are comparable but not identical , this calibration yields an absolute accuracy of @xmath80.5mag and ranges from 12 to 20mag .",
    "the number of stars measured below 1% relative accuracy is 4,535 .",
    "the relative photometric accuracy of all targets are shown in figure [ fig : phot_acc ] .",
    "for detecting the variable sources , we apply the well functioning method described by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the widely - used variability index @xmath9 @xcite and a multiharmonic period search @xcite , but also involves an automatic process of dealing with systematic variability . all light curves with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) were fitted with seven harmonics and ranked using the modified analysis - of - variance statistic @xmath12 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a cut - off limit was set to @xmath13 based on empirical experiments , resulting in 7,677 variable star candidates .",

    "<S> time - series photometry of the corot field src02 was obtained by the berlin exoplanet search telescope ii ( best ii ) in 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> the main aim was the ground based follow - up of the corot field in order to detect variable stars with better spatial resolution than what can be achieved with the corot space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 1,846 variable stars were detected , of which only 30 have been previously known . for nine eclipsing binaries the stellar parameters were determined by modeling their light curve . </S>"
