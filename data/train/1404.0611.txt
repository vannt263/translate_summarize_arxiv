    ", @xmath142 now that one has got @xmath143 , @xmath144 in must equal @xmath145 ( because if there exists some @xmath146 , we ca nt get @xmath147 ) .",

    "* theorem 4*to thoroughly determine whether a given boolean function @xmath0 has non - zero linear structures or not , the @xmath98 in algorithm 1 should rely on the differential uniformity @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath155 , an average of @xmath156 times running the bernstein - vazirani algorithm ( i.e. @xmath157 in algorithm 1 ) will give an answer that @xmath0 has no non - zero linear structure .",
    "* proof of theorem 4 * if @xmath158 , @xmath159 , such that @xmath160 then @xmath161 therefore @xmath63 , @xmath162 , @xmath64 , @xmath163 let @xmath164 .",
    "suppose one has repeated the bernstein - vazirani algorithm for @xmath140 times , and has obtained @xmath116 . by theorem 1 , the probability that @xmath165 is at most @xmath166 that can be made small if we choose @xmath140 of order @xmath167 ( i.e. @xmath168 ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath169 here @xmath170 is a constant , then @xmath171 therefore the probability that @xmath172 is at least @xmath173    learning from @xcite , suppose we have got @xmath174 linearly independent vectors @xmath175 at some time , and @xmath176 is a solution of the equations @xmath177 , then after another expected number of order @xmath178 measures , we will get a @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",

    ", we would find out @xmath3 linearly independent vectors @xmath183 through an expected number of order @xmath184 measures .",
    "from this fact , we can know @xmath119 . about the only one possible solution @xmath185 of the equations @xmath186 , @xmath187 , another expected number of order @xmath178 measures will give a @xmath188 with @xmath189 , this shows @xmath114 .",
    "consequently , through @xmath190 times running we get @xmath191 .",
    "generally , if @xmath192(@xmath94 is a polynomial function of @xmath3 ) , by theorem 4 , through @xmath193 times running the bernstein - vazirani algorithm ( i.e. @xmath194 in algorithm 1 ) will give a `` no '' answer .",
    "a special case is the bent function , whose differential uniformity is @xmath195 , through @xmath196 times will do . if @xmath197(@xmath93 is an exponential function of @xmath3 ) , by theorem 3 and theorem 4 , at least @xmath198 times running will be needed to give the exact result .",
    "a special case is @xmath199 , it need @xmath200 times . if after @xmath201 times running the algorithm , it still has quasi linear structures , these ones must be linear structures except a negligible probability .",
    "any polynomial time would give an approximate solution which is actually the high probability differential .",
    "while the best known classical algorithm for computing walsh spectral is of order @xmath202 , the quantum algorithm ( specifically the bernstein - vazirani algorithm ) can give some informations of it efficiently .",
    "based on this , we present a polynomial - time quantum approximate algorithm for the linear structure of the boolean functions . the quantum algorithm can give a `` no '' answer or an approximate solution set ( i.e. quasi linear structures set ) which includes and tends to the linear structures set .",
    "we havent seen any classical efficient algorithm to this question . besides",
    ", we have also analyzed the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "the error range with the error probability is given . to thoroughly solve the question , the running time of the algorithm",
    "is linked to the differential uniformity of the function .",
    "the smaller of the differential uniformity , the less time should be needed .",
    "just like some papers @xcite , we can use the grover like operator to amplify the amplitude to get a better conclusion , but that is not our concerns .",
    "the point is that maybe the quasi linear structures we get can guide the differential cryptanalysis . and",
