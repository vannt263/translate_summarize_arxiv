    "coarse - graining is the procedure of approximating a system by a simpler or lower - dimensional one , often in some limiting regime .",
    "it arises naturally in various fields such as thermodynamics , quantum mechanics , and molecular dynamics , just to name a few .",
    "typically coarse - graining requires a separation of temporal and/or spatial scales , i.e.  the presence of fast and slow variables . as the ratio of ` fast ' to ` slow ' increases , some form of averaging or homogenization should allow one to remove the fast scales , and obtain a limiting system that focuses on the slow ones .",
    "coarse - graining limits are by nature _ singular limits _ , since information is lost in the coarse - graining procedure ; therefore rigorous proofs of such limits are always non - trivial . although the literature abounds with cases that have been treated successfully , and some fields can even be called well - developed  singular limits in odes and homogenization theory , to name just two  many more cases seem out of reach , such as coarse - graining in materials  @xcite , climate prediction  @xcite , and complex systems  @xcite .",
    "all proofs of singular limits hinge on using certain _ special structure _ of the equations ; well - known examples are compensated compactness  @xcite , the theories of viscosity solutions  @xcite and entropy solutions  @xcite , and the methods of periodic unfolding  @xcite and two - scale convergence  @xcite .",
    "_ variational - evolution structure _ , such as in the case of gradient flows and variational rate - independent systems , also facilitates limits  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce and study such a structure , which arises from the theory of _ large deviations _ for stochastic processes . in recent years",
    "we have discovered that many gradient flows , and also many ` generalized ' gradient systems , can be matched one - to - one to the large - deviation characterization of some stochastic process  @xcite .",
    "the large - deviation rate functional , in this connection , can be seen to _ define _ the generalized gradient system .",
    "this connection has many philosophical and practical implications , which are discussed in the references above .",
    "we show how in such systems , described by a rate functional , ` passing to a limit ' is facilitated by the duality structure that a rate function inherits from the large - deviation context , in a way that meshes particularly well with coarse - graining .",
    "[ sec : coarse - graining - intro ] the systems that we consider in this paper are evolution equations in a space of measures .",
    "typical examples are the forward kolmogorov equations associated with stochastic processes , but also various nonlinear equations , as in one of the examples below .",
    "consider the family of evolution equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a linear or nonlinear operator .",
    "the unknown @xmath2 is a time - dependent borel measure on a state space  @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4\\rightarrow \\mathcal{m}(\\mathcal{x})$ ] . in the systems of this paper , has a variational formulation characterized by a functional @xmath5 such that @xmath6 this variational formulation is closely related to the brezis - ekeland - nayroles variational principle  @xcite and the integrated energy - dissipation identity for gradient flows  @xcite ; see section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our interest in this paper is the limit @xmath7 , and we wish to study the behaviour of the system in this limit .",
    "if we postpone the aspect of coarse - graining for the moment , this corresponds to studying the limit of @xmath2 as @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath2 is characterized by @xmath5 , establishing the limiting behaviour consists of answering two questions :    1 .   _",
    "compactness _ : do solutions of @xmath9 have useful compactness properties , allowing one to extract a subsequence that converges in a suitable topology , say @xmath10 ? 2 .",
    "_ liminf inequality _",
    ": is there a limit functional @xmath11 such that @xmath12 and if so , does one have @xmath13 for some operator @xmath14 ?",
    "a special aspect of the method of the present paper is that it also applies to _ approximate _ solutions . by this",
    "we mean that we are interested in sequences of time - dependent borel measures @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for some @xmath17 .",
    "the exact solutions are special cases when @xmath18 .",
    "the main message of our approach is that all the results then follow from this uniform bound and assumptions on well - prepared initial data .",
    "the compactness question will be answered by the first crucial property of the functionals @xmath5 , which is that they provide an _ a priori _ bound of the type @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes time slice at time @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functionals . in the examples of this paper @xmath22 is a free energy and @xmath23 a relative fisher information , but the structure is more general .",
    "this inequality is reminiscent of the energy - dissipation inequality in the gradient - flow setting .",
    "the uniform bound , by assumption , of the right - hand side of implies that each term in the left - hand side of , i.e. , the free energy at any time @xmath24 and the integral of the fisher information , is also bounded .",
    "this will be used to apply the arzel - ascoli theorem to obtain certain compactness and ` local - equilibrium ' properties .",
    "all this discussion will be made clear in each example in this paper .",
    "the second crucial property of the functionals @xmath5 is that they satisfy a duality relation of the type @xmath25 where the supremum is taken over a class of smooth functions @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known how such duality structures give rise to good convergence properties such as  , but the focus in this paper is on how this duality structure combines well with coarse - graining .    in this paper we define _ coarse - graining _ to be a shift to a reduced , lower dimensional description via a coarse - graining map @xmath27 which identifies relevant information and is typically highly non - injective .",
    "note that @xmath28 may depend on @xmath29 .",
    "a typical example of such a coarse - graining map is a ` reaction coordinate ' in molecular dynamics .",
    "the coarse - grained equivalent of @xmath30\\rightarrow \\mathcal{m}(\\mathcal{x})$ ] is the push - forward @xmath31\\rightarrow\\mathcal{m}(\\mathcal{y})$ ] . if @xmath32 is the law of a stochastic process @xmath33 , then @xmath34 is the law of the process @xmath35",
    ".    there might be several reasons to be interested in @xmath34 rather than @xmath32 itself .",
    "the push - forward @xmath34 obeys a dynamics with fewer degrees of freedom , since @xmath28 is non - injective ; this might allow for more efficient computation .",
    "our first example ( see section  [ dog - sec : concrete - problems ] ) , the overdamped limit in the vlasov - fokker - planck equation , is an example of this . as a second reason , by removing certain degrees of freedom , some specific behaviour of @xmath32 might become clearer ; this is the case with our second and third examples ( section  [ dog - sec : concrete - problems ] ) , where the effect of @xmath28 is to remove a rapid oscillation , leaving behind a slower diffusive movement .",
    "whatever the reason , in this paper we assume that some @xmath28 is given , and that we wish to study the limit of @xmath34 as @xmath36 .    the core of the arguments of this paper , that leads to the characterization of the equation satisfied by the limit of @xmath34 , is captured by the following formal calculation : @xmath37 & & \\sup_g\\ ;   { \\ldj}({\\rho},g\\circ\\xi)\\\\ & \\stackrel{(*)}\\eqqcolon & \\sup_g\\ ; { \\hat \\ldj}({\\hrho},g)\\quad \\stackrel{(**)}=:\\quad{\\hat i}({\\hat \\rho})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us go through the lines one by one .",
    "first , the inequality in the calculation above is due to reduction to a subset of special functions @xmath26 , namely those of the form @xmath38 .",
    "this is in fact an implementation of coarse - graining : in the supremum we decide to limit ourselves to observables of the form @xmath39 which only have access to the information provided by @xmath28 .",
    "after this reduction we pass to the limit and show that @xmath40 converges to some @xmath41at least for appropriately chosen coarse - graining maps .    in the step @xmath42",
    "one requires that the loss - of - information in passing from @xmath43 to @xmath44 is consistent with the loss - of - resolution in considering only functions @xmath38 .",
    "this step requires a proof of _ local equilibrium _ , which describes how the behaviour of @xmath43 that is _ not _ represented explicitly by the push - forward  @xmath44 ,",
    "can nonetheless be deduced from @xmath44 .",
    "this local - equilibrium property is at the core of various coarse - graining methods and is typically determined case by case .",
    "we finally define @xmath45 by duality in terms of @xmath46 as in @xmath47 . in a",
    "_ successful _",
    "application of this method , the resulting functional @xmath48 at the end has ` good ' properties _ despite _ the loss - of - accuracy introduced by the restriction to functions of the form @xmath39 , and this fact acts as a test of success . such good properties should include , for instance , the property that @xmath49 has a unique solution in an appropriate sense .",
    "now let us explain the origin of the functionals @xmath50 .",
    "the abstract methodology that we described above arises naturally in the context of _ large deviations _ , and we next describe this in the context of the three examples that we discuss in the next section .",
    "all three originate from ( slight modifications of ) one stochastic process , that models a collection of interacting particles with inertia in the physical space @xmath51 :    [ dog - eq : intro - vfp - sde ] @xmath52    here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the position and momentum of particles @xmath55 with mass @xmath56 .",
    "equation   is the usual relation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and is a force balance which describes the forces acting on the particle . for this system ,",
    "corresponding to the first example below , these forces are ( a ) a force arising from a fixed potential @xmath59 , ( b ) an interaction force deriving from a potential @xmath60 , ( c ) a friction force , and ( d ) a stochastic force characterized by independent @xmath61-dimensional wiener measures @xmath62 . throughout this paper",
    "we collect @xmath63 and @xmath64 into a single variable @xmath65 .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 characterizes the intensity of collisions of the particle with the solvent ; it is present in both the friction term and the noise term , since they both arise from these collisions ( and in accordance with the einstein relation ) . the parameter @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath69 is the absolute temperature , measures the mean kinetic energy of the solvent molecules , and therefore characterizes the magnitude of collision noise .",
    "typical applications of this system are for instance as a simplified model for chemical reactions , or as a model for particles interacting through coulomb , gravitational , or volume - exclusion forces .",
    "however , our focus in this paper is on methodology , not on technicality , so we will assume that @xmath60 is sufficiently smooth later on .",
    "we now consider the many - particle limit @xmath70 in  .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the empirical measure @xmath71 converges almost surely to the unique solution of the _ vlasov - fokker - planck ( vfp ) equation _  @xcite @xmath72 with an initial datum that derives from the initial distribution of @xmath73 .",
    "the spatial domain here is @xmath74 with coordinates @xmath75 , and subscripts such as in @xmath76 and @xmath77 indicate that differential operators act only on corresponding variables .",
    "the convolution is defined by @xmath78 . in the second line above",
    "we use a slightly shorter way of writing @xmath79 , by introducing the hamiltonian @xmath80 and the canonical symplectic matrix @xmath81 .",
    "this way of writing also highlights that the system is a combination of conservative effects , described by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath60 , and dissipative effects , which are parametrized by @xmath66 . for future reference",
    "we also give the primal form @xmath84 explicitly : @xmath85    the almost - sure convergence of @xmath86 to the solution @xmath43 of the ( deterministic ) vfp equation is the starting point for a _ large - deviation _ result .",
    "in particular it has been shown that the sequence @xmath87 has a _ large - deviation property _",
    "@xcite which characterizes the probability of finding the empirical measure far from the limit @xmath43 , written informally as @xmath88 in terms of a _ rate functional _",
    "@xmath89;\\mathcal{p}({\\mathbb{r}}^{2d}))\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] . assuming that the initial data @xmath90 are chosen to be deterministic , and such that the initial empirical measure @xmath91 converges narrowly to some @xmath92",
    "; then @xmath93 has the form , see @xcite , @xmath94 provided @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the carr - du - champ operator ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.4.2 ) ) @xmath97 if the initial measure @xmath98 is not equal to the limit @xmath92 of the stochastic initial empirical measures , then @xmath99 .",
    "note that the functional @xmath93 in   is non - negative , since @xmath100 is admissible . if @xmath101 , then by replacing @xmath102 by @xmath103 and letting @xmath104 tend to zero we find that @xmath43 is the weak solution of   ( which is unique , given initial data  @xmath92  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore @xmath93 is of the form that we discussed in section  [ dog - sec : outline - var - app ] : @xmath105 , and @xmath101 iff @xmath43 solves  , which is a realization of .",
    "we now apply the coarse - graining method of section  [ sec : coarse - graining - intro ] to three limits : the _ overdamped _",
    "limit @xmath106 , and two _ small - noise _ limits @xmath107 . in each of these three limits ,",
    "the vfp equation   is the starting point , and we prove convergence to a limiting system using appropriate coarse - graining maps .",
    "note that the convergence is therefore from one deterministic equation to another one ; but the method makes use of the large - deviation structure that the vfp equation has inherited from its stochastic origin .",
    "the first limit that we consider is the limit of large friction , @xmath108 , in the vlasov - fokker - planck equation , setting @xmath109 for convenience . to motivate what follows , we divide throughout by @xmath110 and formally let @xmath111 to find @xmath112 which suggests that in the limit @xmath108 , @xmath43 should be maxwellian in @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the normalization constant for the maxwellian distribution .",
    "the main result in section  [ sec : overdamped - limit ] shows that after an appropriate time rescaling , in the limit @xmath106 , the remaining unknown @xmath116;\\mathcal{p}(\\mathbb{r}^d))$ ] solves the vlasov - fokker - planck equation @xmath117    in his seminal work  @xcite , kramers formally discussed these results for the ` kramers equation ' , which corresponds to   with @xmath118 , and this limit has become known as the _ smoluchowski - kramers approximation_. nelson made these ideas rigorous  @xcite by studying the corresponding stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) ; he showed that under suitable rescaling the solution to the langevin equation converges almost surely to the solution of   with @xmath119 . since then various generalizations and related results",
    "have been proved @xcite , mostly using stochastic and asymptotic techniques .    in this article",
    "we recover some of the results mentioned above for the vfp equation using the variational technique described in section  [ dog - sec : outline - var - app ] .",
    "our proof is made up of the following three steps .",
    "theorem  [ dog - thm : vfp - compactness ] provides the necessary compactness properties to pass to the limit , lemma  [ dog - lem : vfp - local - eq ] gives characterization of the limit , and in theorem  [ dog - thm : vfp - liminf - inequality ] we prove the convergence of the solution of the vfp equation to the solution of .",
    "in our second example we consider the following equation @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are one - dimensional derivatives .",
    "this equation can also be written as @xmath124 this corresponds to the vfp equation   with @xmath119 , without friction and with small noise @xmath125 .",
    "in addition to the interpretation as the many - particle limit of  , equation also is the forward kolmogorov equation of a randomly perturbed hamiltonian system in @xmath126 with hamiltonian @xmath83 : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a @xmath129-dimensional wiener process .",
    "this system is a prototype for a large class of hamiltonian systems perturbed by random noise .",
    "when the amplitude @xmath130 of the noise is small , the dynamics splits into fast and slow components .",
    "the fast component approximately follows an unperturbed trajectory of the hamiltonian system , which is a level set of @xmath83 .",
    "the slow component is visible as a slow modification of the value of @xmath83 , corresponding to a motion transversal to the level sets of @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ dog - fig : stochastictrajectories ] illustrates this .    following  @xcite and others , in order to focus on the slow , hamiltonian - changing motion , we rescale time such that the hamiltonian , level - set - following motion is fast , of rate @xmath131 , and the level - set - changing motion is of rate @xmath132 . in other words ,",
    "the process   ` whizzes round ' level sets of @xmath83 , while shifting from one level set to another at rate @xmath132 .",
    "this behaviour suggests choosing a coarse - graining map @xmath133 , which maps a whole _",
    "level set _ to a single point in a new space @xmath134 ; because of the structure of level sets of @xmath83 , the set @xmath134 has a structure that is called a _ graph _ , a union of one - dimensional intervals locally parametrized by the value of the hamiltonian .",
    "figure  [ dog - fig : hamiltonian - graph ] illustrates this , and in section  [ dog - sec : dog ] we discuss it in full detail .    .45 . shown are the level curves of the hamiltonian @xmath83 and for each case a single trajectory.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .45 . shown",

    "this property was first made rigorous in @xcite for a system with one degree of freedom , as here , and non - degenerate noise , using probabilistic techniques . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider the case of degenerate noise by using probabilistic and analytic techniques based on hypoelliptic operators .",
    "more recently this problem has been handled using pde techniques @xcite ( the elliptic case ) and dirichlet forms @xcite . in section",
    "[ dog - sec : dog ] we give a new proof , using the structure outlined in section  [ dog - sec : outline - var - app ] .",
    "the convergence of solutions of   as @xmath136 to a diffusion process on a graph requires that the non - perturbed system has a unique invariant measure on each connected component of a level set . while this is true for a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom , in the higher - dimensional case one might have additional first integrals of motion .",
    "in such a system the slow component will not be a one - dimensional process but a more complicated object ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , by introducing an additional stochastic perturbation that destroys all first integrals except the hamiltonian , one can regain the necessary ergodicity , such that the slow dynamics again lives on a graph .    in section  [ dog - sec : dog - d>1 ]",
    "we discuss this case .",
    "equation   gains an additional noise term , and reads @xmath137 where @xmath138 with @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "the spatial domain is @xmath143 with coordinates @xmath144 and the unknown is a trajectory in the space of probability measures @xmath145\\rightarrow\\mathcal{p}(\\mathbb{r}^{2d})$ ] . as before the aim is to derive the dynamics as @xmath136 .",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite and the results closely mirror the previous case .",
    "the main difference lies in the proof of the local equilibrium statement , which we discuss in section  [ dog - sec : dog - d>1 ] .",
    "the novelty of the present paper lies in the following .    1 .   _ in comparison with existing literature on the three concrete examples treated in this paper : _ the results of the three examples are known in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) , but they are proved by different techniques and in a different setting .",
    "the variational approach of this paper , which has a clear microscopic interpretation from the large - deviation principle , to these problems is new .",
    "we provide alternative proofs , recovering known results , in a unified framework .",
    "in addition , we obtain all the results on compactness , local - equilibrium properties and liminf inequalities solely from the variational structures .",
    "the approach also is applicable to approximate solutions , which obey the original fine - grained dynamics only to some error .",
    "this allows us to work with larger class of measures and to relax many regularity conditions required by the exact solutions .",
    "furthermore , our abstract setting has potential applications to many other systems .",
    "2 .   _ in comparison with recently developed variational - evolutionary methods : _ many recently developed variational techniques for ` passing to a limit ' such as the sandier - saferty method based on the @xmath146-@xmath147 structure  @xcite only apply to gradient flows , i.e. dissipative systems .",
    "the approach of this paper also applies to certain variational - evolutionary systems that include non - dissipative effects , such as generic systems @xcite , as in the examples .",
    "since our approach only uses the duality structure of the rate functionals , which holds true for more general systems , we expect that our method works for other limits in non - gradient - flow systems such as the langevin limit of the nos - hoover - langevin thermostat @xcite .",
    "quantification of the coarse - graining error . _",
    "the use of the rate functional as a central ingredient in ` passing to a limit ' and coarse - graining also allows us to obtain quantitative estimates of the coarse - graining error .",
    "one intermediate result of our analysis is a functional inequality similar to the energy - dissipation inequality in the gradient - flow setting ( see  ) .",
    "this inequality provides an upper bound on the free energy and the integral of the fisher information by the rate functional and initial free energy .",
    "this offers an alternative to the talagrand and log - sobolev inequalities used in the literature @xcite to obtain quantification of the coarse - graining error . to keep the paper to a reasonable length",
    ", we address this issue in details separately in a companion article @xcite .",
    "we provide further comments in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "the similarities between these two approaches and ours is that all the methods hinge on duality structure of the relevant functionals , allow one to obtain both compactness and limiting results , and can work with approximate solutions , see e.g. @xcite and the papers above for details .",
    "in addition , all methods assume some sort of well - prepared initial data , such as bounded initial free energy and boundedness of the functionals .",

    "the first example , of the overdamped limit of the vfp equation , also is interesting in the sense that it derives a dissipative system from a non - dissipative one .",

    "finally , we emphasize that using the duality of the rate functional is mathematically convenient because we do not need to treat the three terms in the right - hand side of separately .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a variational technique that handles coarse - graining and passing to a limit in a unified manner . the technique is based on a duality structure , which is present in many gradient flows and other variational evolutions , and which often arises from a large - deviations principle . </S>",
    "<S> it has three main features : ( a ) a natural interaction between the duality structure and the coarse - graining , ( b ) application to systems with non - dissipative effects , and ( c ) application to coarse - graining of approximate solutions which solve the equation only to some error . as examples , we use this technique to solve three limit problems , the overdamped limit of the vlasov - fokker - planck equation and the small - noise limit of randomly perturbed hamiltonian systems with one and with many degrees of freedom . </S>"
