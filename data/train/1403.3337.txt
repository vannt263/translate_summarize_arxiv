    "the rashba soc parameter is @xmath121 for crosses , @xmath119 mev  nm for solid lines , @xmath120 mev  nm for dashed lines ; in ( b ) @xmath170 mev  nm for dot - dashed lines . all the curves are plotted for @xmath126 , @xmath124 and a fixed width @xmath123 nm . ]    we showed that the rashba soc has a noticeable influence on the differential conductance in the nis structure with highly doped leads only for large values of both @xmath117 and rashba soc strength @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ rashba_h_new ] ) . when the leads are weakly doped , the influence of the rashba soc on the differential conductance is much stronger , especially when the rashba spin - orbit term @xmath2 is comparable to the linear dirac - like term @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ rashba_h_new ] and  [ rashba_influence](a ) for the same values of excitation energy ( @xmath125 ) , band gap parameter ( @xmath128  mev ) and rashba soc parameter ( @xmath120 mev  nm ) , we can see that the rashba soc enhances the differential conductance much more significantly for the low doping potential in the leads . for these qw parameters",
    "the ratio of the spin - orbit coupling term @xmath2 to the quadratic term is @xmath171 ( with @xmath172 ) for the nis structure with highly doped leads ( @xmath118 ev ) and @xmath173 for the nis structure with weakly doped leads ( @xmath167 mev ) .",
    "thus for the regime of low - doping , the competition of the rashba spin - orbit term @xmath2 and the linear dirac - like term @xmath5 leads to a more pronounced influence of the rashba soc on the differential conductance .",
    "[ rashba_influence](a ) shows also the results for a larger value of the band gap ( @xmath174  mev ) in the weakly doped nis - structure . in this case , the differential conductance is reduced in comparison with the case @xmath128  mev due to the decreasing transmission probability through the insulating layer with increasing band gap , although it shows a qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "[ rashba_influence](b ) shows the behavior of the differential conductance as a function of the doping potential in the leads @xmath168 for different values of the rashba soc strength @xmath3 . here",
    ", the influence of the rashba soc is very strong for the same values of the rashba spin - orbit term @xmath2 and dirac - like linear term @xmath5 ( @xmath175 ) . in this case , the differential conductance has a maximum for @xmath176 mev , which corresponds to the rashba spin - orbit term @xmath177 mev and its ratio to the quadratic term is @xmath178 .",
    "the influence of the rashba soc is suppressed by the linear @xmath5-term if the ratio @xmath179 ( see fig .  [ rashba_influence](b ) ) .",
    "the differential conductance for high values of the rashba soc ( for @xmath180 ) shows oscillations for low values of the doping in the leads .",
    "these oscillations can be explained by the increasing differential conductance of separate modes due to the change of the band structure with increasing rashba soc strength ( which e.g. reduces the band gap and increases the density of states ) .",
    "differential conductance as a function of the rashba soc strength is shown in fig .",
    "[ rashba_influence](c ) for the nis - structure with doping potential in the leads @xmath167 mev for zero ( @xmath125 ) and finite ( @xmath181 mev ) excitation energy .",
    "one can see that the influence of the rashba soc is to lead to a monotonic increase of the differential conductance with increasing rashba soc strength @xmath3 caused by the modified band structure .",
    "we note that a similar increase has been found for the differential conductance in a nis - junction with a thin but strong tunnel - barrier in a two - dimensional electron gas with rashba soc @xcite .",
    "we mention that the predicted interplay between the dirac - term characterized by the parameter @xmath182 and the rashba - term characterized by the parameter @xmath3 could be further investigated when comparing hgte qws to inas / gasb qws @xcite , where @xmath3 is naturally of the same order of magnitude as @xmath182 due to the type ii qw structure @xcite , but having otherwise a similar hamiltonian . for a list of parameters for the two types of qws ,",
    "see e.g. ref . @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the subgap bulk transport properties of short and wide nis - hybrid structures based on hgte qws using the extended bhz model which includes rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we applied two methods to obtain the subgap differential conductance due to andreev reflection : the bogoliubov - de gennes equation together with the wave - matching method as well as a matrix method related to the normal state scattering problem .",
    "the two approaches agree in the case of highly doped leads ( the metallic limit ) , in which the effect of the rashba spin - orbit coupling is shown to be small for experimentally relevant parameters .",
    "we showed that the bulk transport properties in highly doped nis - structures are distinctively different for the hgte qw in the inverted regime ( qsh regime ) and for the qw in the trivial insulator regime .",
    "this makes it possible to distinguish the topological order of a two - dimensional topological insulator not only via edge state properties but also via bulk properties . in the case of weakly doped reservoirs ,",
    "the ( full ) bogoliubov - de gennes method has to be used ( especially if the doping potential in the leads is of the order of band gap and superconducting energy gap parameters ( @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) ) .",
    "the effect of rashba spin - orbit coupling is significant in the regime of low - doping with negligible quadratic terms in the energy dispersion and when the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath3 becomes comparable to the dirac - term parameter @xmath182 in the hamiltonian .",
    "andreev reflection on a weakly doped superconducting ( proximity)-region in hgte qws could be important in order to probe characteristics of recently proposed topological superconductors made from hgte qws @xcite . for that purpose , it would be interesting to include also a zeeman field and to extend the present calculations to the josephson effect .",
    "the combined effect of rashba spin - orbit coupling and a zeeman field has been considered for the josephson effect in superconductor@xmath02d electron gas@xmath0superconductor structures in ordinary quantum wells @xcite .",
