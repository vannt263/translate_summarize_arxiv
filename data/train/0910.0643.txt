    "the _ unified model _ paradigm for the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , attributes the wealth of agn classes mostly to different parameters of the same principal system viewed at different angles of the line - of - sight to the relativistic jet .",
    "radiogalaxies and blazars are two extremes : in the former the jet is seen from large whereas in the latter from small angles ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "blazars are dominated by relativistic beaming and they exhibit intense variability at all wavelengths and time scales , highly superluminal apparent speeds , a significant degree of fractional polarization and polarization variability .",
    "shock - in - jet @xcite , colliding relativistic plasma shells @xcite , lighthouse effect @xcite or mhd - instabilities in the accretion disks @xcite are some of the models that attempt to explain variability at different time scales .",
    "although the exact physical processes at play are unclear , the study of the temporal behavior of the sed can shed light on emission mechanism since different mechanisms predict different variability patterns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , multi - frequency monitoring of blazars is essential in understanding the blazar physics .",
    "* the f - gamma alliance : * the large area telescope ( lat ) on - board _ fermi_-gst offers a unique opportunity covering the @xmath1 sky every three hours providing @xmath2-ray light curves at @xmath330 mev - 300 gev . to exploit that , we have initiated a tightly coordinated `` alliance '' of teams ( f - gamma project , *",

    "* ) in order to understand the agn physics via multi - frequency monitoring .",
    "the core program involves the 100-m mpifr telescope ( effelsberg , bonn , 2.64 - 43.00 ghz ) , the 30-m iram telescope ( pico veleta , granada , 86 , 142 , 220 and 270 ghz ) and the 40-m ovro telescope ( owens valley , california , 15 ghz ) . the effelsberg and the iram telescopes do a monthly monitoring of @xmath360 blazars compiled on the basis of their @xmath2-ray detectability ( egret * ? ? ? * ) and their presence in the `` high priority list '' of the lat agn group .",
    "the ovro telescope is monitoring a statistically complete sample of 1200 sources based on the cgrabs catalog @xcite .",
    "the sampling rate is 2 - 3 times a week ( see * ? ? ?",

    "+ * the first 2.5 years : * the f - gamma project has been running since january 2007 at effelsberg and june 2007 at ovro and pico veleta .",
    "the data products of the first 2.5 years can be publicly accessed at www.mpifr.de/div/vlbi/fgamma .",
    "the cross - correlation of the effelsberg / pico sample with the lbas list @xcite showed that 47% of our sources are detected by _",
    "fermi_-gst . a @xmath4 test shows that practically all our sources are variable at all frequencies at a confidence level of 99.9% .",
    "the variability amplitude ( as parameterized by the modulation index @xmath5 ) increases with frequency as expected from frequency flare evolution arguments . for effelsberg ,",
    "the calibration uncertainties are kept to the level of @xmath6 at high frequencies ( @xmath7 ghz ) and of @xmath8 at the low frequencies ( @xmath9 ghz ) .",
    "the characteristic time scales present in the light curves vary from weeks to years while there is a wealth of variability patterns both in the lightcurves and in the spectra .",
