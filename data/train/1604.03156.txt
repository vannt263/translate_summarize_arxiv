    "the main purposes of this paper are to understand the momentum map of the kerr examples and to classify regular ambitoric @xmath0-orbifolds under some completeness assumptions .",
    "one of the tools for studying toric manifolds is the moment map , which in the case of compact toric manifolds identifies the space of torus orbits with a convex polytope in the dual lie algebra of the torus @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the kerr ambitoric structure , we find that the moment map images are not convex ( even locally ) in the regions corresponding to the ring singularity in the interior of the black hole .",
    "to understand the moment map image of kerr , we use the language of _ folded symplectic structures _ studied in @xcite . folded symplectic structures",
    "are @xmath1-forms which are closed and non - degenerate away from certain hypersurfaces which are called _ folding hypersurfaces_. we interpret the khler forms of the kerr ambitoric structure as folded symplectic structures on manifolds which have folding hypersurfaces where the local convexity of the moment map fails .",
    "this result can be understood in the context of example 3.11 in @xcite , which shows that there is no reason for the moment map to be locally convex near a folding hypersurface .    in the second half of the paper ,",
    "we classify complete regular ambitoric orbifolds .",
    "we find it convenient to work with slight generalizations of regular ambitoric orbifolds which we call _ regular ambitoric orbifold completions _ , for which the full ambitoric structure may only be defined on a dense open subset .",
    "more precisely , we call a riemannian manifold _ completable _ if its cauchy completion is an orbifold .",
    "a regular ambitoric orbifold completion is defined to be the cauchy completion of a completable regular ambitoric manifold equipped with a free torus action .",
    "thus every complete regular ambitoric orbifold is a regular ambitoric orbifold completion , since the set of its free torus orbits is an open dense submanifold .",
    "regular ambitoric @xmath0-orbifolds have been locally classified on the set of orbits where the torus action is free @xcite .",
    "we use this local classification to generate a set of examples of regular ambitoric @xmath0-manifolds with free torus action , which we call _ ambitoric ansatz spaces_. these examples include the free orbits of the riemannian kerr examples .",
    "these ambitoric ansatz spaces depend on a symmetric quadratic polynomial @xmath13 and two functions of one variable @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with the manifold given by @xmath16 equipped with the ambitoric structure given in theorem [ thmambitoric ] .",
    "note that an ambitoric structure gives a conformal class of metrics .",
    "we will want to study metric properties , so we need to make a choice of metric in this conformal class .",
    "we pick out some distinguished metrics to study , which are unique up to homothety : the khler metrics @xmath9 , and the barycentric metric @xmath17 , which is an average of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we also study compatible metrics whose ricci tensor is diagonal , meaning that it is invariant under both @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these include the einstein metrics , and they come in a family @xmath22 , indexed by quadratic polynomials @xmath23 orthogonal to the quadratic polynomial @xmath24 with respect to the inner product induced by the discriminant .",
    "the first step in our classification is to classify ambitoric ansatz spaces which are completable with respect to our chosen metric @xmath25 .",
    "the strategy taken is to first compare the @xmath26-cauchy completion to the cauchy completion with respect to a more convenient metric where the cauchy completion is easy to compute .",
    "this comparison is done using the tools of busemann completions , the details of which are provided in an appendix .",
    "we then decompose the convenient boundary into components which we describe as _ folds / corners / edges _ according to their behaviour under the moment map .",
    "when studying @xmath27 , we also have to study the vanishing locus of @xmath28 , which we denote by @xmath29 .",
    "we further define a component of the convenient boundary is _ infinitely distant _ if it does not lie in the @xmath26-cauchy completion , and a fold is _ proper _ if it is not an edge or a corner .",
    "we distinguish between folds being _ positive / negative _ in such a way that proper positive / negative folds are folding hypersurfaces for suitable extensions of the positive / negative khler forms . by studying the @xmath26-cauchy completions , we get the following classification result :    [ thmclasscompletable ] let @xmath30 be an ambitoric ansatz space and @xmath31",
    ". then @xmath30 is @xmath26-completable if and only if the following conditions hold :    * @xmath30 has no proper folds . *",

    "if an edge is a fold but not infinitely distant , then @xmath32 .",
    "* every corner is infinitely distant unless it is at the intersection of two edges which are not infinitely distant .",
    "if such a corner is a positive ( respectively negative ) fold , then @xmath33 ( respectively @xmath32 ) . if @xmath34 , then such a corner is not part of @xmath29",
    "moreover , if @xmath30 is @xmath26-completable , then its ambitoric structure extends to @xmath35 if and only if every fold is infinitely distant .    to classify regular ambitoric orbifold completions",
    ", we first extend the local classification on the set of free torus orbits to a local classification on the cauchy completions .",
    "this allows us to describe the boundary of the set of free orbits in terms of folds / edges / corners as was done in the case of ambitoric ansatz spaces .",
    "we find that in the case where there are no proper folds , we can apply a slight modification of the lokal - global - prinzip for convexity theorems @xcite , which is a tool that can be used to prove that the moment map of a convex toric orbifold is a convex polytope .",
    "this gives us the following partial classification of regular ambitoric orbifold completions :    [ thmcompletionclassification ] let @xmath36 be a connected regular ambitoric orbifold completion , where @xmath25 .",
    "then there exists an ambitoric embedding of @xmath37,j_+,j_-,\\mathbb t)$ ] into some ambitoric ansatz space which is completable with respect to the metric induced by @xmath26 and whose moment map images are polygons .",
    "we combine this classification with our classification of completable ambitoric ansatz spaces to obtain an explicit classification of @xmath17-complete regular ambitoric @xmath0-orbifolds :    [ corambiclass ] a regular ambitoric @xmath0-orbifold which is complete with respect to the barycentric metric @xmath17 is given ( uniquely upto gauge transformation ) by the data of a symmetric quadratic polynomial @xmath13 , a pair of intervals @xmath38 such that @xmath39 does not vanish on @xmath40 , a lattice @xmath41 and two smooth positive functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 satisfying for all @xmath44 small enough :    * if @xmath45 converges , then @xmath46 * if @xmath47 converges , then @xmath48 * for each @xmath49 , if the integrals from the previous conditions corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath51 are both convergent , then @xmath52 ,    where @xmath53 is a convenient choice of normal to the momentum map image of the level sets @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "see definition [ defcompnormal ] .",
    "note that similar results can be obtained for @xmath9 , but the third condition which tests the corners would be more complicated .    as an application for our classification results , we consider compact riemannian @xmath0-manifolds which admit @xmath56-killing @xmath1-forms .",
    "these are riemannian signature analogues of the killing - yano tensor in lorentzian signature , which describes the so - called hidden symmetries of the kerr metric .",
