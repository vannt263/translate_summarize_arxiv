    "in 1943 , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) were discovered with emission lines doppler broadened to widths @xmath5 km / s @xcite .",
    "twenty years later , theorists proposed that these agn were powered by accretion onto compact objects of masses @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "such massive objects can not support themselves against gravitational collapse into supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) @xcite .",
    "sbh masses are tightly correlated with the luminosity @xcite , mass @xcite , and velocity dispersion @xcite of the spheroidal component of their host galaxies .",
    "sbhs primarily grow by accreting gas driven into galactic centers by tidal torques during major mergers @xcite .",
    "however , sbhs can also grow by directly capturing stars that cross their event horizons or by accreting debris from stars passing close enough to be tidally disrupted @xcite .",
    "such tidal - disruption events ( tdes ) could also power bright flares of radiation as the stellar debris is shock heated and subsequently accreted @xcite .",
    "several potential tdes have been found in x - ray @xcite , uv @xcite , and optical @xcite surveys , and tidal debris may also fuel recent blazar activity seen by the swift satellite @xcite .",
    "the handful of tdes found in current surveys implies that thousands more may be found each year in future surveys by the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite . a detailed comparison between predicted and observed tde rates will provide important constraints on sbhs and the galactic centers in which they reside .",
    "frank and rees @xcite were among the first to estimate tde rates .",
    "they introduced the concept of a `` loss cone '' in the stellar phase space that would be depopulated by tidal disruption within a dynamical time @xmath7 .",
    "stars within the loss cone have velocities lying in a cone about the radial direction .",
    "tde rates are set by the rate at which stellar diffusion from other portions of phase space refills this loss cone .",
    "frank and rees evaluated stellar fluxes into the loss cone at a critical radius @xmath8 at which stellar diffusion operating on a reference time scale @xmath9 @xcite could refill the loss cone within @xmath7 .",
    "cohn and kulsrud @xcite provided a more sophisticated treatment of stellar diffusion into the loss cone by numerically integrating the fokker - planck equation in energy - angular momentum space .",
    "more recently , wang and merritt @xcite have revised predicted tde rates using more realistic galactic density profiles and the observed relation between sbh mass and host - galaxy velocity dispersion @xcite .    these analyses focused on smaller sbhs for which a newtonian treatment of tidal forces is valid and the number of directly captured stars is negligible compared to the number that are tidally disrupted .",
    "manasse and misner @xcite introduced fermi normal coordinates that are ideal for a relativistic treatment of the tidal tensor , and calculated this tidal tensor for radial geodesics of the schwarzschild metric for nonspinning sbhs .",
    "marck @xcite generalized this calculation to generically oriented timelike geodesics of the kerr metric @xcite for spinning sbhs .",
    "@xcite used this tidal tensor to calculate the relativistic cross sections for tidal disruption for a range of initial orbital inclinations with respect to the sbh spin .",
    "ivanov and chernyakova @xcite used a numerically fast lagrangian model of a tidally disrupted star to investigate how stellar hydrodynamics affects these relativistic cross sections . in this paper , we combine a similar relativistic treatment of tidal disruption and direct capture with existing calculations of loss - cone physics to derive improved predictions of tde rates for massive and highly spinning sbhs .    the first step in calculating tde rates is to establish criteria for determining when a star is tidally disrupted .",
    "most tidally disrupted stars are initially on highly eccentric or unbound orbits characterized by the distance @xmath10 of their pericenters from the sbh .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of the maximum value of @xmath10 for which tidal disruption occurs can be obtained by equating the differential acceleration @xmath11 experienced by a star of mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 in the tidal field of a black hole of mass @xmath14 to the star s self - gravity @xmath15 .",

    "a star will be directly captured by the sbh when @xmath10 is less than the radius of the event horizon , which for a nonspinning sbh is equal to the schwarzschild radius @xmath17 . since @xmath18",

    ", we find that a sbh with mass @xmath14 greater than @xmath20 should directly capture stars instead of tidally disrupting them .",
    "our estimate of @xmath21 assumed that the gravitational field of the sbh was that of a newtonian point particle , which should only be valid for @xmath22 .",

    "the spacetime of a spinning sbh is described by the kerr metric @xcite .",
    "the kerr metric is a two - parameter family of solutions to einstein s equation fully specified by the sbh mass @xmath14 and dimensionless spin @xmath24 .",
    "theoretical estimates of sbh spins depend sensitively on the extent to which sbhs grow by accretion or mergers .",
    "sbhs accreting from a standard thin disk @xcite can attain a limiting spin @xmath25 @xcite after increasing their mass by a factor @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the spins of sbhs formed in mergers vary greatly depending on whether the spins of the initial binary black holes become aligned with their orbital angular momentum prior to merger @xcite .",
    "sbh spins can be inferred from observations of iron k@xmath27 lines in agn x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "large spins have been measured , such as @xmath28 in the seyfert 1.2 galaxy mcg-06 - 30 - 15 @xcite , although reliable estimates are only available for a small number of systems .",
    "given the large sample of observed tdes expected in the near future and the wide range of predicted sbh spins , it is important to determine the extent to which tde rates depend on sbh spin .",

    "although the spins @xmath179 and @xmath180 depicted by the blue and purple curves in fig .  [ f : grate ] may seem extreme , the simple scenario of growing a sbh from a standard thin accretion disk leads to a limiting spin @xmath181 quite close to the purple curve @xcite .",
    "although uncertain , cosmological predictions for sbh spin distributions can also be peaked near these large values @xcite .",
    "the primary conclusions to draw from our analysis are that relativistic corrections to the tde rate can alter predictions by a factor of several for @xmath0 , and that they can allow tdes to occur for sbhs as large as @xmath95 .      following frank and",
    "rees @xcite , the rates we calculated in the preceding subsection assumed that galaxies had constant - density cores outside the sbh s radius of influence , @xmath182 real galaxies with either power - law or core profiles have mass - density profiles @xmath183 that monotonically decrease with radius .",
    "this raises the question of what is the appropriate number density @xmath124 to insert in our expressions for direct - capture and tde rates .",
    "frank and rees @xcite argued that the appropriate density to use is that at the critical radius @xmath8 at which stellar diffusion can refill the loss cone of tidally disrupted orbits on a dynamical time . a very crude estimate of this density can be made by assuming that @xmath184 , an assumption roughly true for real galaxies as indicated by fig .",

    "( [ e : rtdn ] ) implies @xmath187 wang and merritt @xcite use the isotropic distribution function appropriate for a single isothermal sphere to calculate the true rate at which the loss cone is refilled by stellar diffusion .",
    "they find that their results are well approximated by the fit @xmath188 if we combine this estimate with a recent determination of the relation between sbh mass and host - galaxy velocity dispersion @xcite , @xmath189 we arrive at a final tde rate of @xmath190 in the newtonian limit .",
    "this estimate should be reasonable for the power - law galaxies that dominate the total tde rate ; the core galaxies that host the most massive sbhs have tde rates @xmath191 about an order of magnitude below that of comparable - mass power - law galaxies @xcite .     in power - law galaxies obeying the @xmath192 relation .",

    "@xmath197 predominantly live in galaxies with cored profiles , fig .  [",

    "tidal disruption occurs deep enough in the sbhs potential well that newtonian gravity is no longer valid .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason to expect the orbital angular momenta of tidally disrupted stars to align with sbh spins . for both these reasons , accurate calculations of tde rates require evaluation of the relativistic tidal tensor @xmath59 on a representative sample of generically oriented kerr geodesics .",
    "we have performed a series of monte carlo simulations that provide this required sample .",
    "we use this sample to calculate tde rates for spinning sbh as a function of their mass @xmath14 , both in constant - density cores and in isothermal spheres that approximate real power - law galaxies . we find that for @xmath0 , a significant fraction of stars will be directly captured by the sbh s event horizon instead of being tidally disrupted and subsequently accreted .",
    "this will reduce the observed tde rate assuming that directly captured stellar debris will not have the chance to radiate appreciably before being swallowed by the sbh . above @xmath198 , only highly spinning ( @xmath199 ) sbhs will be able to produce observable tdes .",
