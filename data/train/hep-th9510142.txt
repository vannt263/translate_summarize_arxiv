    "even though non - perturbative string theory has yet to be properly defined we have gained some insight into its structure by using the notion of duality . at this time",
    "no duality can be considered to be rigorously proven simply because this would require a full definition of non - perturbative string theory .",
    "what we can say however is that some of the many proposed dualities do not contradict what we do know of string theory and appear to be self - consistent .",
    "one might then take these reasonably well - established dualities as a defining property of string theory .",
    "perhaps the most powerful duality considered is that of string - string duality @xcite .",
    "this states that the type iia string compactified on a k3 surface gives precisely the same six - dimensional physics as the heterotic string compactified on a 4-torus .",
    "this @xmath0 theory in six dimensions can then be compactified on a 2-torus to yield an @xmath2 theory in four dimensions giving four dimensional statements about duality as discussed in @xcite .    independently of this string - string duality in six dimensions ,",
    "some dual pairs for @xmath0 were proposed in four dimensions in @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the type iia ( or type iib ) string compactified on some  manifold ( or its mirror ) is considered to be equivalent to the heterotic string compactified on a conformal field theory which is essentially derived from a k3 surface times a 2-torus .",
    "in @xcite it was noted that the  manifolds in question could be written as a fibration over a rational curve with generic fibre a k3 surface whereas the k3@xmath3 case can be written as a fibration over a rational curve with generic fibre @xmath4 .",
    "it is then tempting to try to use string - string duality in six - dimensions fibre - wise to deduce these @xmath0 dual pairs in four - dimensions . in @xcite some preliminary observations were made concerning this deduction but the full picture has not yet emerged .",
    "another approach to obtaining more dual pairs in four dimensions is to take orbifolds of the above @xmath2 case . as we do not yet know how to deal with fixed points ,",
    "it is best to start with free - actions on the type ii side .",
    "there are essentially two types of free quotient of k3@xmath3 .",
    "firstly the action can be free on the torus and have fixed points on the k3 surface .",
    "this leads to more @xmath2 theories which were studied in @xcite .",
    "alternatively the action is free on the k3 surface and has fixed points on @xmath5 .",
    "this is essentially unique and was first considered in @xcite .",
    "this example is the central object of study in this paper .",
    "it gives an @xmath0 theory in four dimensions but has many properties one would associate with an @xmath2 theory . in this way it is probably the most `` tame '' @xmath0 theory in four dimensions .",
    "the process of orbifolding to obtain the @xmath2 theories of @xcite was a straight - forward process .",
    "the action of the quotienting group on the k3 surface and torus on the type ii side could be translated into the heterotic language to produce the dual asymmetric orbifold . in this @xmath2 case",
    "the resulting asymmetric orbifold is automatically modular invariant .",
    "we are not so lucky with the @xmath0 case of @xcite however and so the orbifolding process must be more subtle if we are to obtain a dual pair .",
    "the trick appears to be to use some degrees of freedom from the r - r sector of the type ii string .",
    "such degrees of freedom are rather trivial from the point of view of the conformal field theory on the type ii side but can effect the modular invariance properties of the conformal field theory on the heterotic side . thus there must be some non - perturbative consistency requirement that we do not yet understand on the type ii side if duality is to work . in this paper",
    "we will give a natural topological interpretation to the discrete degrees of freedom which must be employed to satisfy this non - perturbative consistency requirement .",
    "we will see that both the 1-form and the 3-form r - r fields in the type iia string appear to play an important rle .    when one considers @xmath0 theories in four dimensions the possibility of phase transitions must be considered .",
    "it was first noticed many years ago @xcite that the moduli spaces of various manifolds appeared to be `` connected '' to each other by going through points where the 3-fold degenerates .",
    "this lead to the idea that perhaps string theories corresponding to vacua given by different manifolds could be deformed into each other @xcite . the simplest kind of degeneration considered for such a process is that of a `` conifold '' .",
    "the immediate problem with this idea was that the conformal field theory associated to the degenerate 3-fold was itself degenerate .",
    "thus the original idea was that string theory might `` tunnel '' between vacua .",
    "more recently it was realized that although the conformal field theory might be sick on the degenerate 3-fold , the complete non - perturbative type ii string was probably well - behaved @xcite .",
    "in fact , an example of a `` phase transition '' based on a conifold concerning type ii string theories compactified on different  manifolds could be understood in terms of the string theory as well as algebraic geometry @xcite .",
    "if there is a heterotic string theory that is dual to a given type ii string on a  manifold then one should be able to see this transition in terms of the heterotic string too .",
    "for the conifold transition studied in @xcite the heterotic dual is not yet known . in @xcite",
    "however , an example of a phase transition that looked a lot like a conifold transition was given .",
    "unfortunately the type ii dual for that example is not yet known .",
    "recently some lists of potential dual pairs were given in @xcite where the transitions are also understood from the heterotic side . in this paper",
    "we will describe a case where both the type iib string picture and the heterotic string picture can be given .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to spell out some nomenclature we will use here as usage of the word `` conifold '' has varied in the past .",
    "the term `` conifold '' was first introduced in @xcite to refer to an algebraic variety with a finite number of nodes .",
    "a node is an isolated singularity locally of the form @xmath6 some later uses of the word `` conifold '' have been more general than this .",
    "we will use the original definition .",
    "locally such a node can be resolved either by a deformation of complex structure , which replaces the node by a single @xmath7 , or by a `` small resolution '' which replaces the node by an @xmath8 . within a conifold , there can be an obstruction to the small resolution if we demand that the resulting space is khler .",
    "if there is no such obstruction then we have a conifold transition between two  manifolds .",
    "the transition and degenerations considered in this paper are _ not _ of this type .",
    "we will use the term `` extremal transition '' to refer to the general process of a topology change due to being able to resolve a singularity either by a deformation of complex structure or a deformation of khler form ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we will also use the term `` phase transition '' for this more general process .",
    "there are many extremal transitions which are not conifold transitions .",
    "an example based on a orbifold was studied in @xcite .",
    "the original proposal in @xcite was that _ all _  manifolds should somehow be connected together by extremal transitions . it was stated in rather modest terms however .",
    "firstly only simply - connected manifolds were considered and secondly non - khler manifolds were allowed as intermediate states .",
    "it was seen in @xcite that a surprisingly large class of simply - connected manifolds could be connected without the need for non - khler manifolds .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that perhaps all @xmath0 theories in four dimensions might be connected by phase transitions .",
    "this leaves open the issue of @xmath9 however . for reasons we will give later , one might suspect that @xmath9 should not change .",
    "we will show that in our example @xmath9 can indeed change and so this potential obstacle for connecting all  manifolds together is removed .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts  one dealing with the analysis of the discrete degrees of freedom of the type ii string and one dealing with the phase transition .",
    "the two parts can be read independently of each other but it is worth emphasizing that they should be considered to be intimately linked as they ultimately both analyze exactly the same vector within the lattice @xmath10 . in section [ s : orb ]",
    "we will analyze carefully the complete moduli space of type ii strings compactified on a space in the form of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 acts freely .",
    "this will allow us in section [ s : het ] to identify exactly which type iia string is dual to the heterotic string in the dual pair we consider .",
    "in section [ s : deg ] we will examine closely a point in the moduli space of the type iia and type iib string where a rather curious degeneration occurs . in section [ s : pht ]",
    "we show how this leads to the phase transition already understood from the heterotic side from @xcite .",
    "finally in section [ s : conc ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "we wish to consider orbifolds in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a smooth manifold and @xmath12 is a discrete group that acts freely .",
    "thus @xmath15 is also a smooth manifold .",
    "of particular interest to us is the detailed form of the moduli space of string theories on @xmath15 .",
    "this comes from the singular cohomology of @xmath15 as we now discuss .",
    "the 10-dimensional form of a string theory contains fields described by @xmath16-forms for various values of @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the action will have @xmath17-form field - strengths .",
    "such fields in the 10-dimensional picture can lead to moduli in the lower - dimensional theory upon compactification on @xmath15 .",
    "the general picture is that one can `` integrate '' the @xmath16-form over some @xmath16-cycle within @xmath15 .",
    "thus the number of moduli obtained per @xmath16-form would appear to be @xmath18 .",
    "( in general more moduli can appear from duality transformations but we need not concern ourselves with those here . )    as well as the dimension of the moduli space arising from the @xmath16-forms in ten - dimensional space - time we would also like to know the precise form of this moduli space . given the lack of a precise definition of string theory we can not really establish anything rigorously here but we can make some reasonable guesses .",
    "firstly we will assert some periodicity on these moduli .",
    "this amounts to saying that shifting the moduli by an element of @xmath19 results in a shift in the action by @xmath20 and hence has no effect on the resulting physics .",
    "this periodicity can be viewed as arising from the `` quantization '' of soliton charges @xcite and was shown to follow directly from duality in the case of k3@xmath3 in @xcite .",
    "thus far we appear to be saying that the moduli space is @xmath21 .",
    "there can also be extra discrete degrees of freedom coming from torsion cycles within @xmath15 .",
    "that is , we may have a singular cycle , @xmath22 , which is homologically non - trivial but @xmath23=0 $ ] for some integer @xmath24 .",
    "we can consistently attach phases to such cycles to give discrete degrees of freedom to the moduli .",
    "this extra degree of freedom is not particularly new as in the case @xmath25 they correspond to nothing more than `` wilson lines '' . the case @xmath26 has already been considered in string theory for the @xmath27-field in the context of `` discrete torsion '' @xcite .",
    "all said , we claim that each @xmath16-form in the ten - dimensional picture contributes a factor @xmath28 to the moduli space , where @xmath29 denotes the torsion part .",
    "see @xcite for the methods used to obtain the various equalities in ( [ eq : mp ] ) .",
    "our notation will always assume ( co)homology to be over the integers unless otherwise specified . in the case of",
    "@xmath25 we have @xmath30 .",
    "this is precisely the moduli space of flat @xmath31-bundles on @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath32 we are making a similar statement for `` currents '' arising from @xmath33-branes .",
    "in particular , as stated above , we have already encountered @xmath34 in string theory @xcite .",
    "now we want to determine the moduli space for the orbifold @xmath13 .",
    "locally it is certainly the case that the moduli of @xmath15 are the @xmath12-invariant moduli of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we first need to establish the moduli space of @xmath14",
    ". then we should consider the possibility that there may be homology cycles in @xmath15 that did not descend from @xmath14 .",
    "that is , the quotient map @xmath35 yields @xmath36 which is injective but not an isomorphism .",
    "@xmath12 as a superscript denotes the @xmath12-invariant part .",
    "the cokernel of this map gives us precisely the extra discrete degrees of freedom present in the orbifold . in this paper",
    "we will work with cohomology as well as homology .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the detailed relationship between these groups .",
    "our main weapon for comparing the cohomology of @xmath15 and @xmath14 is the _ hochschild - serre spectral sequence _",
    "@xcite . that is , there is a spectral sequence with second stage @xmath37 this converges to @xmath38 where @xmath39    detailed analysis of this spectral sequence can be rather messy in general but we can make some simple statements .",
    "firstly the term @xmath40 is simple group cohomology ( that is , of the form @xmath41 where @xmath12 acts trivially on @xmath42 ) .",
    "unless killed by earlier stages of the spectral sequence this will have either of two effects on @xmath43 .",
    "firstly it can remove some of @xmath44 from @xmath45 .",
    "secondly it can contribute torsion to @xmath46 .",
    "either of these effects will increase the discrete degrees of freedom in @xmath47 relative to the moduli space of @xmath14 .",
    "if we assume @xmath14 is simply connected and @xmath12 is finite then for the case @xmath48 these new discrete degrees of freedom are in fact given precisely by @xmath49 , which is the abelianization of @xmath12 , and for the case @xmath34 we have @xmath50 .",
    "this simplification explains why we have not had to suffer the complexities of spectral sequences in the past . for @xmath25 , the new degrees of freedom ,",
    "`` wilson lines '' were given simply by the quotienting group itself and for @xmath26 we only had to worry about basic group cohomology to find the `` discrete torsion '' .",
    "in the cases @xmath51 life appears to demand the hochschild - serre spectral sequence in its full glory to understand the effect of orbifolding .    in general other entries in @xmath52",
    "will also effect these discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , one of the contributions can come from the fact that the moduli space of @xmath12-invariant theories on @xmath14 is not connected even though the complete moduli space of theories on @xmath14 is connected .",
    "let @xmath14 be a product of a k3 surface and a 2-torus as in @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 admits a symmetry @xmath53 . the generator , @xmath54 , of @xmath12 acts freely on the k3 surface .",
    "the quotient k3@xmath55 is known as the `` enriques surface '' and is not a  surface . in particular , if @xmath56 is a ( 2,0)-form on the k3 surface then @xmath57 if the 2-torus is represented by periodic identification of the 2-plane with coordinates @xmath58 then @xmath59 .",
    "thus @xmath54 has 4 fixed points on @xmath5 .",
    "the complete action of @xmath54 is free as required .",
    "the topology of @xmath15 is very rich and is one of the reasons why a full understanding of string duality on this manifold would provide great insight into the general case .",
    "the global holonomy of @xmath15 is @xmath60 .",
    "thus , although @xmath14 is a  manifold it does not have the generic holonomy @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to some simplifications such as no world - sheet instanton corrections to the type ii string .",
    "next consider the fundamental group . if @xmath62 is the simply - connected covering space of @xmath15 then @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath64 where the @xmath65 acts on the lattice @xmath66 as @xmath54 acted on the torus .",
    "@xmath67    we can now give the cohomology for the case in question from the above discussion . in terms of homology , which is clearer for our purposes , @xmath68 this is obtained from the spectral sequence shown in figure [ fig : ss ] . to compute the exact progression of this spectral sequence we need to compare this spectral sequence to that for the enriques surface as quotient of a k3 surface .",
    "we also need to know that @xmath15 can be written as an elliptic fibration over an enriques surface and that this bundle has a section .",
    "one can then show that @xmath69 has torsion as given in ( [ eq : hx ] ) and that the two @xmath70 maps shown in figure [ fig : ss ] are surjective .",
    "note that we recover the result @xmath71 .",
    "now let us consider compactifying the type iia superstring on the manifold @xmath15 .",
    "in order to analyze the moduli space we first need the ( connected part of ) the moduli space of a iia string on @xmath14 that admits @xmath12 as a symmetry .",
    "this is readily shown to be @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a lattice with intersection form signature @xmath75 and @xmath76 is its group of rotational isometries .",
    "note that neither @xmath77 nor @xmath78 in ( [ eq : mys ] ) are self - dual .    from ( [ eq : hx ] ) we can now find the extra discrete degrees of freedom exhibited by the type iia string on @xmath15 .",
    "firstly the ns - ns sector of the type iia string has a 2-form .",
    "this gives a @xmath65-valued parameter .",
    "the ns - ns degrees of freedom should be visible from the conformal field theory .",
    "this is not really `` discrete torsion '' in the sense of @xcite as @xmath79 but rather has its origins in the fact that the moduli space of @xmath12-invariant theories on @xmath14 is not connected . we will not discuss this further although it would be interesting to analyze this in terms of mirror symmetry and the consequences for the heterotic dual picture .    in the r - r sector",
    "we have a 1-form and a 3-form .",
    "first take the 1-form .",
    "the first homology of @xmath15 is entirely torsion in the form @xmath80 .",
    "this gives us effectively a choice of 7 non - trivial wilson lines .",
    "two of the @xmath65 s may be considered to be remnants of the first homology of the @xmath5 .",
    "the other @xmath65 corresponds to usual picture of lines in @xmath14 whose ends are identified by @xmath12 descending to closed loops in @xmath15 .",
    "the 3-form also contributes non - trivial choices . in this case",
    "the extra homology is of the form @xmath80 where one of these factors appears as torsion in @xmath81 .",
    "again two of these factors are remnants of the 1-cycles on the torus .",
    "the torsion term comes from @xmath82 .",
    "this also has origins in the torus  it arises from the class in @xmath83 which is dual to the homology class of the torus itself .",
    "if we accept that the type iia string compactified on a k3 surface is dual to the heterotic string on @xmath4 then it follows that the type iia string on @xmath14 is dual to a heterotic string on @xmath84 .",
    "one can then try to orbifold this dual pair by our @xmath65-action to form another dual pair with @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "making this orbifolding process non - perturbatively correct is not a simple matter however @xcite .",
    "first let us interpret the moduli space given in ( [ eq : my ] ) .",
    "the moduli space of type iia strings on @xmath14 is given by @xcite @xmath85 in this case @xmath10 is an even self - dual lattice that can be identified as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 @xcite and @xmath88 is the narain lattice @xmath89 as in @xcite .    given that @xmath10 can also be identified as the narain lattice for compactification of the heterotic string we now have an idea of the identification between these dual pairs .",
    "in particular , as we know how @xmath12 acts on the cohomology of @xmath14 , we can almost see how it acts on the narain lattice .",
    "unfortunately our knowledge is not complete .",
    "what we find by this route is only how @xmath12 acts by _ rotations _ on the narain lattice .",
    "we also need to know about translations .    in order to understand the translations we look at the gauge group of the string theory . on the heterotic side , for a generic torus",
    ", the gauge group arises from the metric  la kaluza - klein from isometries of the torus .",
    "this corresponds to the translations of the narain lattice and the gauge group is generically @xmath90 .",
    "how does this @xmath90 arise on the type iia side and how does this fit into the type ii interpretation of @xmath10 ?",
    "firstly we have a metric in the ten - dimensional theory which produces gauge fields from isometries , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "secondly we have a 2-form which compactifies on 1-cycles @xmath92 to give gauge fields .",
    "these two contributions obviously come from the @xmath88 of @xmath5 .",
    "next we have a 1-form in the ten - dimensional theory which descends trivially down into a @xmath31 gauge group upon compactification .",
    "it seems natural to identify this with the @xmath93 direction .",
    "we also have a 3-form which compactifies on 2-cycles to give gauge fields .",
    "22 of these 2-cycles come from @xmath94 .",
    "the last gauge field comes from the 2-cycle given by @xmath5 itself . within @xmath14",
    "this homology element maps to @xmath95 under the isomorphism @xmath96 .",
    "this completes our identification of all 28 gauge fields with shifts in @xmath10 .",
    "if we ignore translations and take the asymmetric orbifold of the heterotic string by the rotation of @xmath10 induced by @xmath12 , it was observed in @xcite that one could not obtain a modular invariant theory because of level - matching problems @xcite .",
    "if @xmath54 acts by both a rotation and a shift simultaneously however , one can satisfy level - matching .    the shift used in @xcite",
    "was uniquely identified as a half - shift along the lattice vector of length ( squared ) @xmath97 contained in the lattice generated by @xmath93 and @xmath95 .",
    "that is , both @xmath93 and @xmath95 must be shifted as each of these directions alone has length zero .",
    "the ability to shift by this half - vector of the lattice must manifest itself as one of the discrete degrees of freedom of the orbifold theory on @xmath15 .",
    "let us try to find exactly which degree of freedom it should be .",
    "since the @xmath93 direction comes from the 1-form in ten - dimensions , this must be associated with an element of @xmath98 .",
    "the new element of @xmath98 introduced in the quotienting process was the `` wilson line '' joining points in @xmath14 identified by @xmath12 .",
    "thus , this shift in @xmath93 corresponds to `` switching on '' this `` wilson line '' degree of freedom in the orbifold @xmath15 .",
    "this was also observed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath95 direction comes from the 3-form in ten - dimensions compactified over the @xmath99 .",
    "as explained above , a new element in @xmath100 arises from this torus from the @xmath101 term in the spectral sequence .",
    "it would thus appear that we also have to switch on this discrete degree of freedom too to obtain a truly consistent non - perturbative string theory .    to summarize , the r - r fields in the 10-dimensional type ii string theory give discrete parameters in the compactified theory .",
    "modular invariance of the dual heterotic string theory demands that some of these parameters are `` switched on '' .",
    "one is associated with 1-cycles on @xmath15 and one is associated with 3-cycles on @xmath15 .",
    "both of these cycles are torsion elements of the homology of @xmath15 .",
    "the origins of these discrete degrees of freedom from the spectral sequence are circled in figure [ fig : ss ] .",
    "consider the moduli space of type ii string theories on k3@xmath3 .",
    "can we undergo a phase transition to another class of theories ?",
    "that is , are there any extremal transitions of k3@xmath3 ?",
    "the answer is no . to undergo an extremal transition one first goes to the boundary of moduli space a finite distance away where something degenerates .",
    "this we can do by letting the k3 surface acquire an orbifold singularity .",
    "we then try to resolve this singularity in a way inequivalent to how we reached the degeneration .",
    "this we can not do  any attempt to resolve the orbifold singularity will return us to k3@xmath3 .",
    "thus , type ii strings on k3@xmath3 appear to be an isolated island in the grand moduli space of all theories .",
    "the same is also true of each of the other @xmath2 quotients of @xcite .",
    "can we expect anything different for @xmath102 then ?",
    "in @xcite it was argued from the heterotic side that there was a point in a given connected component of the moduli space of these theories where a phase transition was possible . in this section",
    "we will argue the same from the type ii side .",
    "how can @xmath15 acquire a singularity ?",
    "there are two ways .",
    "firstly the covering space @xmath14 may be singular . from what we said above however , such a degeneration can not be interesting from the point of view of phase transitions as all we can do to move away from such a point is to go back into the moduli space from whence we came .",
    "alternatively the quotienting process by @xmath12 may degenerate .",
    "that is , @xmath12 is meant to act freely but at the boundary of the moduli space it can acquire fixed points .",
    "this latter case offers a doorway into other moduli spaces as we shall see .",
    "the moduli space of type ii strings on @xmath14 was given in ( [ eq : my0 ] ) .",
    "the first factor is the only one of interest to us and may be regarded as quotient of the grassmanian of space - like 6-planes in @xmath103 by the isometry group of the even self - dual lattice @xmath104 .",
    "the connected component of the moduli space of @xmath12-invariant theories given in ( [ eq : my ] ) is obtained easily from this by analyzing how @xmath12 acts on the lattice @xmath10 and the 6-plane . from our knowledge of how to interpret @xmath10 in terms of @xmath14 from section [ s : het ]",
    "we can decompose @xmath10 as @xmath105 where each of the above terms on the right are even self - dual , and then identify the action of @xmath12 as generated by @xmath106    the result given in ( [ eq : mys ] ) is derived given that @xmath107 is the @xmath12-invariant part of the lattice and @xmath108 is the set of lattice vectors orthogonal to @xmath77 .",
    "the 6-plane itself , which we will call @xmath109 , must be the product of a 2-plane , @xmath110 , which is invariant under @xmath12 and a 4-plane , @xmath111 , such that any vector in @xmath111 is inverted by @xmath54 .",
    "the result is that the moduli space is a quotient of the product of the grassmanian of space - like 2-planes in @xmath112 and the grassmanian of space - like 4-planes in @xmath113 .",
    "the former is a factor in the moduli space generated by the scalars coming from vector multiplets and the latter forms the moduli space generated by the hypermultiplets .    the lattice @xmath77 is naturally interpreted as the lattice of invariant cohomology on the original k3 surface .",

    "we see that @xmath121 and @xmath122 . if we arrange @xmath110 so that it is orthogonal to @xmath123 and @xmath111 so that it is orthogonal to @xmath124 then we will have @xmath109 orthogonal to @xmath125 as desired .",
    "we also necessarily have @xmath119 orthogonal to @xmath109 at the same time .",
    "we can identify these two vectors with @xmath8 s within the k3 surface in @xmath14 as explained in @xcite .",

    "we also fix the @xmath27-field in the direction associated with the homology classes of these spheres _ and _ we have also fixed the r - r moduli to have zero values in these directions .",

    "the effect of quotienting by @xmath12 is to identify the two @xmath8 s given by @xmath125 and @xmath119 .",

    "that is , in addition to the vector multiplet becoming massless we also have a hypermultiplet in the same representation of the gauge group @xcite .",
    "we can also see this directly from the heterotic picture . in this case",
    "we obtain massless states due to winding / momentum modes around @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the fact that we can form both invariant and anti - invariant vectors from @xmath125 and @xmath119 shows that we get a hypermultiplet and a vector multiplet from each .",
    "this is like the @xmath2 yang - mills theory of @xcite .",
    "there are no phase transitions associated to this as we expected .    in order to achieve this degeneration we needed to choose a special point within @xmath129 and @xmath130 at the same time .",
    "that is , both the vector multiplet and hypermultiplet moduli had to be tuned simultaneously . if we want to obtain a degeneration by tuning just one of the sets of moduli we need to look for length @xmath97 vectors within @xmath77 or @xmath78",
    "let us focus on the vector multiplet moduli space , i.e. , look for a vector of length @xmath97 within @xmath77 .",
    "there are only two such vectors which we denote @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "thus , if @xmath110 is perpendicular to @xmath131 then we have an enhanced gauge group @xmath126 again . what is the geometrical interpretation of this ?    we have identified @xmath77 as the invariant part of the total cohomology of the k3 surface .",

    "we can usually understand quantum geometry in terms of classical geometry by using mirror symmetry and this is no exception .",

    "let us analyze the type iib string compactified on @xmath139 .    to solve a notational problem , rather than considering a type iib theory compactified on @xmath139 , from now on we will consider the type iib theory to be compactified on @xmath15 .",

    ", @xmath114 is now the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath15 and @xmath116 is the moduli space of `` quaternionified '' khler forms .",
    "thus , rather than requiring @xmath15 to be a particular size to get our @xmath126 gauge group in the type iia case , we can ask that @xmath15 takes a particular complex structure in the type iib case .    for type iib strings ,",
    "the lattice @xmath77 is now identified with the lattice _",

    "= 12.5 cm    let us suppose first that @xmath110 is not perpendicular to @xmath131 .",
    "we have an @xmath8 within the k3 surface whose homology class is given by @xmath131 .",
    "as @xmath54 acts freely on the k3 surface there must be another sphere in the k3 surface which is the image of the first sphere under @xmath54 and whose homology class is @xmath132 .",
    "see figure [ fig : a ] for this configuration . now rotate @xmath110 to be perpendicular to @xmath131 .",
    "now these spheres should become rational curves as they are dual to ( 1,1)-forms .",
    "this can not be however since this would imply that the curves given by @xmath131 and @xmath132 are both `` effective '' which is impossible ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "thus something must have gone wrong .",
    "that is to say , we simply can not build an enriques surface as the free quotient of a k3 surface if the k3 surface has this special complex structure .",
    "nothing has gone wrong with the k3 surface itself so far as its complex structure is concerned so it must be the quotienting process which has degenerated .    the way to picture the situation",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : a ] .",
    "when @xmath131 is orthogonal to @xmath110 , it becomes a rational curve at which point its area is given by integrating the khler form over it .",
    "in this case , the khler form is invariant under @xmath12 and so must be orthogonal to @xmath131 .",
    "thus the areas of both spheres are zero .",
    "this is not all that happens however . in order to resolve the paradox above these spheres",
    "must become a fixed point of the quotienting .",
    "that is to say , as we rotate @xmath110 to become perpendicular to @xmath131 , the two spheres in the k3 surface both shrink down to zero size and coalesce . taking",
    "the orbifold of this k3 surface by this @xmath65 action will result in a degenerate enriques surface .",
    "this surface is quite interesting and has been analyzed in many places such as @xcite . in our case , the threefold @xmath15 will degenerate to singular object which we call @xmath143 .",
    "now let us review the heterotic side of this story given in @xcite .",
    "the winding / momentum modes around @xmath144 again give massless modes .",
    "as @xmath144 are invariant under @xmath54 we get only vector multiplets from these lattice elements .",
    "the gauge group has been enhanced to @xmath126 .",
    "in addition to these massless states we obtain more from the twisted sector . the energy of a @xmath54-twisted left - moving string of length @xmath145 with no oscillators is @xmath146 where the eigenvalues of the rotation of the lattice are given by @xmath147 .",
    "recall that in section [ s : het ] we made @xmath54 act by a translation on the lattice @xmath10 by @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the shortest strings in the twisted sector are those given by the vectors @xmath149 and these have zero energy .",
    "that is , they are massless states .",
    "this zero energy - level was precisely the reason why this translation was introduced in the first place  in order to satisfy level - matching . under @xmath54 , these lattice vectors are anti - invariant and so these new states in the heterotic string are hypermultiplets",
    ". they also have half the @xmath31-charge of the vector multiplets which became massless to give the @xmath126 gauge group .",
    "it follows that they are @xmath150 s of @xmath126 .",
    "following methods from @xcite one can count the degeneracy and finds one gets 4 states .",
    "all counted therefore , at this point corresponding to the type iib string on @xmath143 we obtain an enhanced gauge group of @xmath126 with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation becoming massless .",
    "this situation was considered in @xcite where it played a special rle due to the fact it is conformally invariant .",
    "conformal invariance was important for consistency of the duality picture too as explained in @xcite .",
    "we now see a peculiar connection between this section and section [ s : het ] .",
    "the translation by @xmath148 that was allowed by discrete degrees of freedom coming from the r - r sector of the type ii string plays an essential rle in finding the massless spectrum of the theory at the most interesting point in the moduli space of theories .",
    "in @xcite an example of a phase transition was given .",
    "this example consisted of a conifold transition in which one degenerates the complex structure of the starting manifold to acquire a collection of isolated `` nodes '' each of which is locally of the form @xmath151 in @xmath152 with coordinates @xmath153 .",
    "if this is done in just the right way then the resulting singular space can be blown - up by a small resolution ( replacing points by @xmath154 s ) into a new manifold .",
    "since ( [ eq : node ] ) is one of simplest singularities one obtains in three dimensions it is reasonable to expect conifold transitions to be fairly common .",
    "there is another singularity which is just as simple : namely @xmath155 in this case , the singularity occurs for all @xmath156 and so occurs along a whole object of complex dimension one within the threefold .",
    "that is , ( [ eq : node ] ) is a singularity of codimension three whereas ( [ eq : dblpt ] ) is codimension two .",
    "codimension two singularities can appear in k3 surfaces and have been considered in @xcite . in the k3 case",
    "one can obtain enhanced non - abelian gauge groups when such singularities appear and then ( [ eq : dblpt ] ) gives @xmath126 .",
    "it therefore seems not unreasonable to expect the same thing to happen for threefolds .",
    "note that there is no reason to expect enhanced gauge groups for conifold points , i.e. , codimension three singularities .",
    "in fact , an example of the heterotic dual picture of a conifold transition was conjectured in @xcite but this plays no essential rle in the transition .",
    "it is present both before and after the conifold transition . ] and no enhancement occurs .    in our case @xmath143 contains a whole @xmath154 of singularities . at a generic point on this curve",
    "the singularity is of the form ( [ eq : dblpt ] ) .",
    "it should not come as a surprise then to get an enhanced @xmath126 at this point in the moduli space of @xmath15 s .    at four points on the @xmath154 of singularities",
    "the singularity is worse than ( [ eq : dblpt ] ) .",
    "these singularities are related to degenerate enriques surfaces of the form discussed in section [ s : deg ] .",
    "now let us try to resolve @xmath143 to obtain a new manifold .",
    "consider first a @xmath65-action on a k3 surface which does not act freely but rather fixes a rational curve .",
    "consider the limit of the resulting quotient as we blow this fixed rational curve down to a point .",
    "it is not hard to convince oneself that the resulting space is essentially the same degenerate enriques surface we had above . taking this up to three complex dimensions",
    "it is clear how to proceed .",
    "let @xmath157 and consider a group @xmath158 generated by @xmath159 which acts as a symmetry of @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath159 is similar to @xmath54 in that it has the same action on @xmath5 and satisfies ( [ eq : enri ] ) .",
    "the difference is that @xmath159 fixes a rational curve , @xmath22 , within the k3 surface .",
    "let @xmath160 .",
    "the space @xmath161 is itself singular as the orbifold had fixed points .",
    "we can blow @xmath161 up to obtain @xmath162 which is smooth . on the other hand , by varying the khler form on @xmath161 we can change the area of @xmath22 . in the limit that this area goes to zero we claim that @xmath161 becomes the same space as @xmath143 .",
    "this shows that @xmath15 can be deformed into @xmath162 by going via the singular space @xmath143 as @xmath163 the maps @xmath164 and @xmath165 are both blow - downs , i.e. , deformations of khler form and the horizontal map is a deformation of complex structure .",
    "the hodge numbers of @xmath162 are simple to compute .",
    "the existence of a rational curve to be fixed on the k3 surface will obstruct one deformation of complex structure relative to @xmath15 .",
    "thus @xmath166 .",
    "the orbifold @xmath161 has 4 fixed @xmath154 s .",
    "blowing these up gives a contribution of 4 to @xmath167 from @xmath164 .",
    "@xmath165 blows just one curve down and so contributes 1 to @xmath167 .",
    "thus , @xmath168 .",
    "one can also show that @xmath162 is simply - connected .",
    "we show the blow - up schematically in figure [ fig : b ] by showing complex dimensions as real .",
    "the heterotic story of this transition was given in @xcite .",
    "we degenerate the original theory in the `` coulomb '' phase by varying a scalar from a vector multiplet to enhance one of the @xmath31 factors in the gauge group to @xmath126 .",
    "at this point four hypermultiplets in the form of * 2 * s of this @xmath126 become massless . by giving",
    "non - zero values to the scalars in these new hypermultiplets we can venture off into the `` higgs '' phase .",
    "the number of extra quaternionic dimensions from these hypermultiplets in this new phase is @xmath169 .",
    "the effect of this is to completely break @xmath126 including any @xmath31 subgroup .",
    "thus there are @xmath170 hypermultiplets and @xmath171 vector multiplets in agreement with the type iib picture above .",
    "in @xcite there was some speculation that @xmath162 might be some particular complete intersection in a weighted projective space .",

    "this should not come a complete surprise for the following reason .",
    "when we go to the interesting degeneration point in the type iia moduli space , as we explained earlier , the covering k3 surface must have volume of order the planck scale .",
    "when we go through the phase transition we lose the modulus from the vector multiplet which gave us the ability to change the volume .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable that the space we go to from the phase transition is `` stuck '' at the planck scale .",
    "a more precise statement of this is that the mirror of @xmath162 has no  phase and is of the type discussed in @xcite .",
    "the extremal transition we have considered , from @xmath15 to @xmath162 , takes us from one voisin manifold to another .",
    "one can certainly envision a generalization of this process where we move to more voisin manifolds .",
    "all we need to do is to further degenerate the quotienting so as to pick up more fixed points .",
    "unfortunately it is not simple to do this within the current context .",
    "the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath162 is a subset of those on @xmath15 and it follows that every degeneration of @xmath162 can be understood in terms of a degeneration of the covering k3 rather than a degeneration of the quotient .",
    "this does not mean it can not be done however as we have yet to explore the hypermultiplet moduli space .",
    "in this paper we have studied two aspects of type ii string theory on @xmath15 , where @xmath15 which is an orbifold without fixed points of k3@xmath176 .",
    "firstly there are quite subtle discrete degrees of freedom coming from the r - r sector which must be employed to obtain modular invariance of the dual heterotic string .",
    "the precise explanation of this effect in terms of the type ii string is not yet understood and one might say we have no right to expect we can understand it until we have a better definition for string theory .",
    "what we did however was to give an explicit geometrical interpretation of these degrees of freedom .",
    "secondly we examined a phase transition from the type iib string on @xmath15 to another type iib string theory on @xmath162 .",
    "it turned out that this analysis was intimately connected to the first question of discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "these degrees of freedom affect the numbers of massless states precisely at the point of degeneration connecting the two phases . this may give some further insight into these discrete parameters .",
    "it is also gives further evidence that we have indeed correctly identified a type ii / heterotic dual pair .",
    "construction of the heterotic dual to the type iia string on @xmath15 was obtained by orbifolding the generally - believed string - string duality in six dimensions compactified on a torus .",
    "one would have hoped that this case would have been easy as the orbifold action was free but we still had problems with discrete degrees of freedom . in order to understand more dual pairs with @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions",
    "it would be nice to extend this construction to orbifolds with fixed points .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that such a process is problematic .",
    "there it was stated that `` orbifolding does not commute with duality '' .",
    "it would be nice to think that we can rescue orbifolding from such a fate by understanding how it should be modified in the non - perturbative context .",
    "the example studied in this paper might give some insight into this problem as @xmath162 is constructed from an orbifold with fixed points .",
    "extremal transitions are performed by shrinking down @xmath8 s , @xmath7 s and/or rational surfaces within a  manifold to obtain a degenerate space .",
    "this is then followed by a reverse procedure to give a new manifold . since the objects which are shrunk down are all simply connected it appears , at first sight , that @xmath9 can not change during such a transition .",
    "if this were the case then @xmath9 would provide an obstruction to connecting up the moduli space of all  manifolds with extremal transitions . from the example studied in this paper",
    "we see that @xmath9 can change .",
    "how this happens is clear from figure [ fig : a ] .",
    "the two spheres in this figure within @xmath14 are identified by the freely acting @xmath65 and so we can write a non - contractable loop in @xmath15 as the image on the quotient of a line connecting one sphere to the other . as we go to the degeneration , @xmath143 , the spheres approach and",
    "so this line shrinks down to zero length , i.e. , the loop in @xmath15 has contracted and @xmath177 .",
    "thus , as the @xmath8 s shrink down , an @xmath178 also shrinks down as a side - effect .",
    "as @xmath9 can no longer be viewed as an obstruction , the possibility remains that all  manifolds may be connected by extremal transitions .",
    "now that we have identified the phase into which the type ii string on @xmath15 passes it would be nice to do further analysis of the corresponding seiberg - witten theory . in @xcite it was shown that seiberg - witten theory could be recovered from the @xmath179 limit of the dual pair conjectured in @xcite ( see also @xcite for discussions relevent to this ) .",
    "that is , the yang - mills theory of the heterotic string theory is linked to the algebraic geometry of the type ii theory to agree with @xcite .",
    "here such an analysis may prove even more interesting because of the presence of the higgs phase .",
    "one thing to note is the fact that the five new interesting hypermultiplet moduli are identified as blowing - up modes within @xmath162 . that is",
    ", they are khler modes and are thus subject to world - sheet instanton corrections . to remove such effects we need to go to the type iia string on the mirror of @xmath162 .",
    "as explained above , it is probably the case that @xmath162 has no  mirror .",
    "this should not discourage us however as one can still build a model for the moduli space of complex structure of the mirror by analyzing it in some other phase , such as a landau - ginzburg phase .",
    "it is not immediately apparent how to do this as we have not written @xmath162 in the form of a complete intersection .",
