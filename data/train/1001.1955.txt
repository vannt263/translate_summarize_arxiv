    "vapors of alkali metal atoms are ideal for studying coherent light - matter interactions because the single outer electron results in a relatively simple optical spectrum with isolated lines .",
    "alkali metals are the atom of choice in many areas of atomic physics such as ultracold atoms @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , both of which are currently areas of extensive activity . while most studies have been carried out using continuous wave lasers and frequency domain methods , alkali atoms have also been studied using transient optical techniques . for example , tri - level @xcite and two - photon @xcite photon - echoes were first observed in a sodium vapor .",
    "propagation effects @xcite , quantum interference @xcite and non - markovian dynamics @xcite have been studied in a potassium vapor .",
    "recently , rubidium vapor has been used as a model system for developing optical two - dimensional fourier transform ( 2dft ) spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the technique of 2dft spectroscopy was originally developed in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "implementation in the optical region of the spectrum was first proposed using a raman excitation scheme to study molecular vibrations @xcite .",
    "currently , 2dft techniques using infrared excitation to study molecular vibrations are widely used @xcite .",
    "2dft techniques using near - ir to visible excitation is also used to study electronic excitations in molecules @xcite and semiconductor nanostructures @xcite .",
    "2dft spectroscopy explicitly measures the phase of a transient four - wave mixing ( tfwm ) signal during two time periods of a three - pulse excitation sequence @xcite .",
    "the resulting data is fourier transformed onto a two - dimensional frequency plane , thus separating the electronic interactions between photoexcited states .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of the coherent optical response of potassium vapor in a thin transmission cell using optical 2dft spectroscopy .",
    "data is acquired for the standard rephasing and non - rephasing configurations , as well as for the projection that isolates the non - radiative `` raman '' coherence @xcite .",
    "we observe peak shapes and amplitudes associated with two coupled @xmath2 lines . by increasing the number density",
    ", we can observe effects due to propagation .",

    "[ fig : scheme ] . a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser supplies @xmath3 pulses , centered at 768.2 nm , to the multidimensional optical nonlinear spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer splits the ti : sapphire pulses into four phase - locked replicas that are aligned in the box geometry .",
    "the pulses are focused on the same spot of a home - made alkali vapor cell .",
    "three pulses ( a , b and c ) generate a tfwm signal .",
    "time delays between the pulses are denoted @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 between the first and second , the second and third and the third pulse and signal respectively .",
    "pulse four provides the phase - stabilized tracer ( tr ) and reference ( ref ) separately : the tracer co - propagates with the tfwm signal and is useful for alignment , but is blocked during the 2dft measurements ; the reference beam is routed around the vapor cell and recombined with the signal , producing an interferogram that is recorded by a cooled ccd spectrometer .",
    "the phase of the signal field is determined by an all - optical method , which is realized by careful measurement of relative phases between all laser pulses and the tfwm signal @xcite .",
    "further experimental details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the tfwm signal , @xmath7 , is generated in the phase - matched direction @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the conjugated pulse .",
    "the subscripts , @xmath10 or @xmath11 only denote direction , not time ordering .",
    "if @xmath12 arrives first the resulting 2dft spectrum , @xmath13 , is known as `` rephasing '' because the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening is canceled . in a tfwm experiment ,",
    "this time ordering produces a photon echo .",
    "if @xmath12 arrives second , the cancelation of dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening does not occur and the resulting @xmath14 spectra are referred to as `` nonrephasing '' .",
    "@xmath15 spectra , where @xmath12 arrives last , are sensitive to two - quantum resonances @xcite .",
    "the time resolved spectra @xmath16 are usually fourier transformed with respect to two time delays , while the third delay is fixed .",
    "the time delays @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined based on time ordering , not direction , and thus are strictly positive .",
    "reflection cells designed for high temperature vapor experiments @xcite can not be used in our multidimensional spectroscopy apparatus because the signal is detected in transmission @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a reflection geometry the phase of the signal depends on the position of the interface producing the reflection .",
    "therefore , a thin transmission cell for alkali atomic vapor has been designed and manufactured for the current experiment .",
    "the cell body is machined from high - grade titanium .",
    "two sapphire windows are separately diffusion bonded to the titanium body .",
    "the gap between two windows can be adjusted before the transmission cell is loaded with solid potassium @xcite .",
    "the vapor temperature is controlled by a heater attached to the transmission cell , up to a maximum of @xmath17 . however , for the measurement reported here , the cell temperature is varied from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , ensuring low absorption and number densities in the range @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xcite . during the measurements , the absorption spectrum of the potassium vapor at each temperature",
