    "this section is intended to recall some of the milestones in the development of the standard model of the electroweak interaction .",
    "it is too sketchy to be a proper history .",
    "furthermore , it is more a history of the way things could have gone , rather than the way they actually went . for a proper historical account , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of the weak interaction began 100 years ago , with the discovery of beta decay by h.  becquerel .",
    "it was not recognized at the time that this was due to a new force , however .",
    "the first `` modern '' theory of the weak interaction was due to fermi ( 1933 ) @xcite , and involved a four - fermion interaction lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermi constant and the fermion fields are those of the proton , neutron , electron , and electron neutrino . ) . ]",
    "the discovery of the muon in 1947 allowed the study of the weak interaction in another context , and it was soon realized that the weak interaction is the same for electrons and muons .",
    "the universality of the weak interaction suggested that it is mediated by a gauge boson , in analogy with quantum electrodynamics , and that the electron and muon have the same weak `` charge . '' however , gauge bosons are exactly massless , while the hypothetical weak gauge boson is necessarily massive , since it yields the fermi theory at energies much less than the weak - boson mass .",
    "this obstacle was surmounted in 1967 by weinberg and salam , who argued that the weak interaction is indeed a gauge theory , but with the gauge symmetry spontaneously broken , such that the weak gauge boson acquires a mass @xcite .",
    "we now jump to 1996 , where we have a beautiful theory of the electroweak ( and strong ) interactions acting on three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "it is fair to say that the gauge interactions are understood , and that the masses of the weak gauge bosons , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are understood to be a consequence of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking is unknown .",
    "this mechanism is also responsible , at least in part , for the fermion masses and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( including cp violation ) , so its complete elucidation is essential to our quest to understand nature at a deeper level .",
    "although we do not know what the electroweak - symmetry - breaking mechanism is , we know that it involves new particles and new forces .",
    "it is possible that it will take another 100 years before we completely understand the nature of these particles and forces .",
    "to explain what is meant by weakly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking , i draw an analogy with the fermi theory , which is the low - energy limit of a weakly - coupled theory , namely the electroweak gauge theory .",
    "consider the calculation of a four - fermion amplitude in the fermi theory of the weak interaction , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we use the interaction lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ fermi ] ) , to calculate the amplitude perturbatively .",
    "we can use dimensional analysis to derive the dependence of the amplitude on the typical energy in the process , @xmath6 .",
    "the fermi constant , @xmath3 , has units of inverse energy squared . since the amplitude is dimensionless , the leading term in the amplitude , from the diagram in fig .",
    "1(a ) , is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "=    at next order in perturbation theory , one has the one - loop diagram in fig .",
    "1(b ) . using dimensional analysis",
    ", we see that this diagram is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "thus we are performing a perturbative expansion in powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 .",
    "this statement is in fact correct , but the argument is somewhat more subtle , because the loop integration is ultraviolet divergent . the modern attitude towards this divergence is encompassed by the idea of an `` effective field theory '' @xcite .",
    "let s say we only believe the fermi theory up to some energy @xmath9 .",
    "we restrict the loop integration to momenta less than @xmath10 , and profess ignorance about what happens for momenta greater than @xmath10 .",
    "however , we can not simply throw away the contribution from momenta greater than @xmath10 .",
    "instead , we parameterize it by adding additional terms to the interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath11 which are characterized by having two derivatives , and an unknown dimensionless coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "these terms yield a tree - level contribution to the amplitude proportional to @xmath13 , indicated in fig .",
    "thus the next - to - leading - order amplitude is given schematically by @xmath14 where the ultraviolet divergence of the loop diagram is evidenced by the dependence of the amplitude on @xmath15 .",
    "combining the last two terms using @xmath16 yields @xmath17 where @xmath18 is to be taken from experiment .",
    "thus the amplitude is indeed an expansion in powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 , despite the ultraviolet divergence .    at low energies , @xmath19 , only the first few terms in the expansion",
    "are numerically important , and the amplitude depends on just a few coefficients which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "however , for @xmath20 , every term in the expansion is equally important , and the amplitude depends on an infinite number of unknown coefficients .",
    "the theory therefore loses all predictive power .",
    "it is sometimes said that the theory `` breaks down '' or becomes `` strongly - interacting , '' but in fact the theory simply becomes useless .",
    "there is a quick way to estimate the critical energy at which the theory becomes unpredictive , which also allows us to get the numerical factors straight .",
    "unitarity implies that the partial waves of a two - particle scattering amplitude have a real part which does not exceed 1/2 in magnitude .",
    "if the leading term in the expansion were to greatly exceed this bound , the higher - order terms in the expansion would have to be just as large as the leading term in order to restore unitarity .",
    "but if that were the case , then every term in the expansion is equally important , and the theory is unpredictive .",
    "so we can estimate the critical energy by imposing the unitarity bound on the leading - order amplitude .",
    "this yields @xcite @xmath21 thus the fermi theory loses predictive power for @xmath22 gev .",
    "it is a logical possibility that physics simply becomes very complicated at energies in excess of the critical energy .",
    "however , history has taught us to expect the opposite : the theory becomes simpler at higher energy . in the case of the fermi theory ,",
    "the four - fermion interaction is replaced by the exchange of a weak gauge boson , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the amplitude is proportional to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gauge coupling , and the denominator is from the @xmath4 propagator . since @xmath25 the amplitude reduces to that of the fermi theory for @xmath26 .",
    "however , for @xmath27 , the amplitude is proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "hence the expansion parameter is a ( small ) constant , and the theory is predictive for all energies .",
    "= 0.64    in the case of the fermi theory , new physics , in the form of the @xmath4 boson , enters before the critical energy .",
    "formally , @xmath29 using eqs .",
    "( [ ecfermi ] ) and ( [ gf ] ) .. ] the fact that the new physics enters before the critical energy can thus be related to the fact that @xmath30 , i.e. , that the theory is weakly coupled .      in the previous section ,",
    "the @xmath4 boson was responsible for regulating the growth of the four - fermion amplitude at high energy .",
    "now consider the scattering of the @xmath4 bosons themselves , in particular longitudinal ( helicity - zero ) @xmath4 bosons , as shown in fig .",
    "the top row of feynman diagrams depicts the gauge interactions responsible for the scattering .",
    "the resulting amplitude is proportional to @xmath7 , just as in the case of the fermi theory . using unitarity",
    ", we estimate the critical energy to be @xcite @xmath31 thus the electroweak theory loses predictive power for @xmath32 tev .",
    "=    by analogy with the fermi theory , we might expect new physics , in the form of a new particle , to regulate the growth of the amplitude .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the standard higgs model .",
    "the higgs boson gives rise to additional feynman diagrams , shown in the second row in fig .",
    "these diagrams cancel the terms proportional to @xmath7 , leaving behind an amplitude proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the higgs self - coupling .",
    "thus the expansion parameter is a ( small ) constant , and the theory is predictive for all energies .",
    ", to be discussed in a later footnote .",
    "] higgs - higgs scattering is also proportional to @xmath34 , so the theory is complete .",
    "the formal relation between the higgs mass and the critical energy is @xmath35 where the last relation relies on @xmath36 , known from non - perturbative studies of the standard higgs model @xcite .",
    "thus the new physics , namely the higgs boson , enters before the critical energy because the theory is weakly coupled .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the standard higgs model , and variations of it ( such as two higgs doublets , as used in supersymmetric models ) , are the only weakly - coupled models of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "to explain what is meant by strongly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking , i draw an analogy with low - energy pion physics , which is the low - energy limit of a strongly - coupled theory , namely qcd .",
    "the low - energy interaction of pions is dictated by the fact that they are the ( approximate ) goldstone bosons of spontaneously - broken chiral symmetry .",
    "this is embodied by an effective field theory of pions called `` chiral perturbation theory '' @xcite .",
    "the leading interaction of pions is @xmath37 where @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the pion decay constant .",
    "the coupling @xmath40 has dimensions of inverse energy squared , in analogy with the fermi constant , @xmath3 .",
    "the leading - order amplitude for @xmath41 scattering is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "using unitarity to estimate the critical energy at which the theory loses predictive power yields @xmath43    what actually happens in nature in @xmath41 scattering at 450 mev ?",
    "one begins to encounter a plethora of new particles , beginning with the @xmath44 meson .",
    "meson has once again been recognized by the particle data group , but they are hedging on its mass : @xmath45 @xcite . ]",
    "the theory of pion interactions becomes complicated above 450 mev , and loses all predictive power . unlike the case of a weakly - coupled theory",
    ", there is no new particle ( the analogue of a @xmath4 or a higgs boson ) that restores predictivity to the theory . as the higgs boson of the pion theory",
    "this interpretation is invalidated by the @xmath46 , which is comparable in mass to the @xmath44 .",
    "a true higgs theory would have no such particle . ]",
    "although the pion theory becomes complicated above 450 mev , we have learned that nature is nevertheless simple : there is a new description of physics in terms of quarks and gluons , interacting via qcd . at low energies",
    "this theory is strongly - interacting , and gives rise to all the complications of hadron physics .",
    "but even at low energies the theory itself is simple , in the sense that it is described by a lagrangian with just a few terms in it , and the only parameters are the strong coupling constant and the quark masses .      now consider @xmath47 scattering near the critical energy of 1.2 tev , and imagine that nature does not provide a higgs boson to regulate the growth of the amplitude with energy .",
    "what will happen ?",
    "there is no answer to this question within the electroweak theory ; it simply becomes unpredictive .",
    "however , based on our experience with pion physics , we might expect that there is a deeper , simpler theory , which is hidden from view by virtue of the fact that it is strongly interacting , and therefore manifests itself in a complicated way .",
    "this would mean that there are new particles in nature , experiencing a new strong interaction .",
    "for example , one can imagine that this simpler theory is analogous to qcd .",
    "this is the idea behind the so - called technicolor theory @xcite . in that case",
    ", one would encounter the analogues of the @xmath44 , @xmath46 , etc .",
    ", at energies above 1.2 tev .",
    "these `` technimesons '' would be made from strongly - interacting `` techniquarks , '' bound together by `` technigluons . ''",
    "this class of models is reviewed by appelquist at this symposium .",
    "in this section i make some observations about the phenomenological implications of electroweak symmetry breaking for colliders with energy in excess of the lhc ( @xmath48 tev ) and the nlc ( @xmath0 tev ) .",
    "i begin where i left off , with the case of strongly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "let s continue our analogy with pion physics .",
    "to study the strong interaction at low energy , one performs scattering experiments involving pions . for example",
    ", one can perform @xmath41 scattering experiments , or study the coupling of the pion to virtual photons , as depicted in fig .",
    "the analogues of these processes for the electroweak interaction are shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , where the longitudinal @xmath4 bosons replace the pions . the incident fermions could be either quarks and antiquarks ( lhc ) or electrons and positrons ( nlc )",
    ". these colliders will be capable of probing these processes at energies of about 1 tev , comparable to the critical energy of 1.2 tev at which the theory loses predictive power .",
    "= 0.9    recall that the critical energy for @xmath41 scattering is about 450 mev .",
    "how much would we know about the strong interaction if we had data from @xmath41 scattering and @xmath49 at energies only up to 450 mev ?",
    "the answer is very little",
    ". we might know about the @xmath44 , but we would see only the low - energy tail of the @xmath50 , and the heavier mesons would be completely out of sight .",
    "more importantly , we would not know that the mesons are composed of strongly - interacting quarks , interacting via qcd .",
    "the moral is that if the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is indeed strongly - coupled , it will likely require energies greatly in excess of 1 tev for the complete elucidation of this physics .",
    "this implies the need for colliders beyond the lhc and nlc .",
    "although these machines are likely to tell us _ something _ about strongly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking , it is hard to imagine they will be able to tell us _ everything _ about it .",
    "the case of weakly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking is apparently in stark contrast with that of the strongly - coupled case .",
    "for example , the standard higgs model has a higgs boson with mass less than 700 gev @xcite , and nothing else .",
    "the lhc and nlc are both capable of discovering this particle .",
    "once discovered , and its coupling to itself and other particles measured , we have learned everything there is to learn about electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "can it really be this simple ?",
    "probably not .",
    "although the standard higgs model is predictive at all energies , it suffers from another disease - it is `` unnatural '' @xcite .",
    "we know that the higgs field acquires a vacuum - expectation value of @xmath51 gev .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "5(a ) is one of the one - loop corrections to the vacuum - expectation value , from a higgs loop .",
    "there are similar one - loop corrections from loops of weak bosons and fermions .",
    "all these one - loop diagrams share the feature that they are quadratically divergent @xcite .",
    "let us regard the standard higgs model as being valid up to some energy @xmath10 .",
    "the relation between the bare vacuum - expectation value , @xmath52 , and the actual vacuum - expectation value , @xmath53 , may be approximated by cutting off the loop integration at momenta of order @xmath10 : @xmath54 where the factor @xmath55 is the usual factor which arises from loop diagrams .",
    "there is also an ( unknown ) contribution from momenta greater than @xmath10 , but we will assume that it does not conspire to cancel the contribution from momenta less than @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath56 , then @xmath52 must be tuned to almost exactly cancel the one - loop contribution to the vacuum - expectation value .",
    "such a fine tuning is unnatural .",
    "instead , it is natural to expect @xmath57 .",
    "thus if nature makes use of the standard higgs model , we anticipate that it is replaced by a more fundamental theory at energy @xmath58 tev , regardless of the higgs mass . , is a running coupling , and increases with energy ( for sufficiently - large higgs mass ) , eventually blowing up .",
    "new physics must intervene before this occurs .",
    "this can be used to place an upper bound on the higgs mass for a given energy scale of the new physics @xcite .",
    "for example , if the new physics is at the planck scale , there is an upper bound on the higgs mass of about 200 gev @xcite .",
    "however , naturalness implies that there is new physics by at least 3 tev , so it is not realistic to imagine that there is no new physics until the planck scale . imposing the condition that the higgs coupling not blow up below 3 tev yields an upper bound on the higgs mass of only about 700 gev . ]",
    "= 0.725    thus we see that weakly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking may not be so different from strongly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the strongly - coupled approach involves new physics at the tev scale , while the weakly - coupled approach suggests new physics ( beyond the standard higgs model ) by at least the tev scale .",
    "it could be that this new physics lies well below the tev scale , in which case it may be possible to discover all of it with the lhc / nlc .",
    "but if it really lies at the tev scale , it will likely require colliders beyond the lhc / nlc for its complete elucidation .",
    "a well - known example of new physics in the weakly - coupled scenario is supersymmetry .",
    "if nature is supersymmetric , every particle is accompanied by a superpartner . the one - loop correction to the higgs vacuum - expectation value in fig .",
    "5(a ) is accompanied by a second diagram , shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , in which the higgs loop is replaced by a higgsino loop .",
    "the quadratic divergences of each diagram cancel , and the theory becomes natural .",
    "the same sort of cancellation occurs for loops of weak bosons and fermions and their superpartners .",
    "if nature is supersymmetric , then supersymmetry must be broken , since we do nt observe the superpartners of the known particles .",
    "let s refer to the mass scale of the superpartners as @xmath59 .",
    "it @xmath59 were much larger than @xmath53 , the quadratic divergence would reappear , cut off only when the momenta reach @xmath59 : @xmath60 thus the model is only natural if @xmath61 3 tev .",
    "more careful estimates yield a somewhat lower scale @xcite .",
    "if @xmath59 is at the tev scale , it may require colliders beyond the lhc / nlc to discover all the superpartners and measure their couplings .",
    "however , if @xmath59 is a few hundred gev , then all the physics of supersymmetry may be within reach of the lhc / nlc .",
    "this is the only natural scenario i know of in which the entire physics of electroweak symmetry breaking is elucidated by these colliders .",
    "however , even in this scenario , there may be motivation for higher - energy colliders .",
    "the physics of supersymmetry breaking may lie at the 10 tev scale , as in the class of models in which dynamical supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the standard model via new gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the elucidation of the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking will reveal to us the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is also possible that the new physics which subsumes the standard higgs model at the tev scale is strongly - interacting , and has nothing to do with supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "this class of models is similar to the strongly - coupled electroweak - symmetry - breaking scenario , with the exception that there is a higgs boson .",
    "the complete elucidation of these models would likely require colliders beyond the lhc / nlc , as in the strongly - coupled models .",
    "the history of the weak interaction was punctuated by periods of confusion , followed by clarification , which ultimately led to a beautiful theory .",
    "for example , the early measurements of beta decay indicated that the emitted electron was monoenergetic .",
    "it took twenty years to establish that the electron is emitted with a continuous spectrum of energies .",
    "this was the first evidence for the existence of the neutrino , which was a vital ingredient in fermi s theory of the weak interaction @xcite .",
    "the same sequence of events is likely to occur for the electroweak - symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "in fact , we are already in the first stage , the period of confusion .",
    "there are already several experimental results which have been interpreted as a higgs boson @xcite .",
    "these interpretations have been made either in the context of a multi - higgs model , or with additional new physics ",
    "none has had an interpretation in terms of the standard higgs model with no new physics .",
    "a particularly noteworthy example is ref .",
    "@xcite , which was an attempt to interpret the @xmath62 as a higgs boson with enhanced coupling to @xmath63 quarks . was conjectured to be responsible for a monoenergetic photon signal in @xmath64 decay , via @xmath65 .",
    "the experiment turned out to be erroneous . ]",
    "this would imply an enhanced coupling to muons , which led the authors to conclude that if their interpretation were correct , `` the case for construction of a dedicated muon collider for higgs boson studies will become as compelling as it is technically feasible . '' the idea of using a muon collider for resonant higgs production ( even the standard higgs ) has lately resurfaced and been considerably refined @xcite .",
    "my final historical remark concerns our ability to foresee the physics of the future .",
    "there are many examples of incorrect theories and prognostications , many more than correct ones , and these are often held up as examples of our inability to predict what will be found in the next generation of colliders . while i have some sympathy for this point , i also feel it can be overstated .",
    "a well - known example is the top - quark mass ; predictions ranged from 15 gev ( just above the reach of pep ) to 230 gev , and everything in between .",
    "but perhaps this makes us lose sight of the real achievement : we knew the top quark existed long before it was discovered , based entirely on indirect evidence .    today",
    "many feel that there is indirect evidence for weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "although the evidence is not as compelling as it was for the top quark , an advocate might make the following statement :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` there can be no two opinions about the practical utility of supersymmetry , but until clear experimental evidence for the existence of supersymmetry can be obtained , supersymmetry must remain purely hypothetical .",
    "failure to detect any evidence of supersymmetry is no evidence against its existence . ''",
