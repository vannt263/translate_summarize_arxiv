    "during the last few years we have carried out a programme to enlarge the sample of high - redshift radio galaxies ( @xmath2 , hzrgs hereafter ) , by selecting ultra - steep - spectrum ( uss ) radio sources @xcite .",
    "this project has included radio imaging , optical broad - band imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "most of the optical observations were carried out as a key programme at the european southern observatory in chile . until now our uss radio source survey has resulted in the discovery of 29 radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath2 @xcite , i.e. about half of the total number of galaxies known at such high redshifts .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission from hzrgs can be very bright , with fluxes @xmath21 erg s@xmath14 @xmath5 ( luminosities @xmath22 erg s@xmath14 ) , and can extend over more than @xmath23 ( @xmath24 kpc ) . these ly@xmath1 halos are therefore ideal targets for ground - based optical telescopes , providing a powerful tool for studying the gas around the most massive galaxies known in the early universe .",
    "the morphologies and kinematics of the emission line gas in low - redshift radio galaxies have been studied extensively ( e.g. baum et al .",
    "1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "only now are sufficiently large numbers of hzrgs known to allow such detailed studies at high redshifts so that the properties of the emission line halos at low and high redshifts can be compared .",
    "such a comparison may help to constrain the evolution of the radio galaxies and their environments .",
    "furthermore , these extended ly@xmath1 halos provide an opportunity to observe hi absorption clouds against a spatially resolved background source .",
    "since the late sixties , there have been extensive studies of absorption lines against the strong continuum emission from quasar nuclei . because quasars are spatially unresolved , such studies yield no direct information on the spatial scale of the absorbers .",
    "the detection of such absorption clouds against the ly@xmath1 emission of hzrgs can , however , provide us with spatial information about the absorbing clouds .",
    "an additional advantage of studying absorption against the strong ly@xmath1 of hzrgs is that no strong ionizing continuum is ( directly ) observed from hzrgs that could influence the properties of the absorber .",
    "we have previously presented observations of the ly@xmath1 kinematics of two radio galaxies , with strong spatially extended absorption being seen in 0943@xmath25242 at @xmath26 @xcite , and complex kinematics in 1243 + 036 at @xmath27 ( van ojik et al .",
    "earlier , a high resolution spectrum of the ly@xmath1 emission from 4c41.17 has been presented by chambers et al .",
    "we report here on the results of high spectral resolution observations of a further 15 radio galaxies from our sample .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe the selection of objects and the observations . in sect .",
    "3 we present the two - dimensional and one - dimensional ly@xmath1 spectra .",
    "the spectra are described in detail and parametrized to obtain the properties of the line - emitting gas and hi absorption systems ; correlations between the ly@xmath1 and radio properties are investigated . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the physical properties of the ly@xmath1-emitting gas ( including its kinematics and dynamics ) and the hi absorption systems , and their relationship with the radio galaxy .",
    "we go on to discuss the implications of our work for the dust content of hzrgs and , finally , we put forward three scenarios which may account for the interaction between the radio source and the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in sect . 5 .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath28 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath29 .",
    "the main criterion for the selection of objects from our sample of high redshift radio galaxies was that spectra with good signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio be obtained .",
    "we therefore concentrated on the objects with bright ly@xmath1 emission and redshifts which placed ly@xmath1 in the most sensitive range of the spectrographs and detectors .",
    "the s / n ratio at very blue wavelengths is also limited by the transmission of the atmosphere .",
    "we therefore selected objects with redshifts @xmath30 . as a secondary consideration we gave preference to objects whose spatial extent was large on the low resolution spectra .",
    "high resolution optical spectroscopy was carried out during several different observing sessions .",
    "most of the observations were made with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) of the european southern observatory in chile .",
    "one session was with the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) in australia and one session with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma , spain ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the spectral resolutions ranged from 1.5 to 3   fwhm , corresponding to 100200 km s@xmath14 , about a factor of ten better than in the low resolution discovery spectra @xcite where the ly@xmath1 emission lines are just resolved , with velocity dispersions @xmath1310002000 km s@xmath14 ( fwhm ) .",
    "a resolution of 23   is therefore well suited to studying the overall kinematical structure of the emission - line gas and the possible presence of strong hi absorption in the ly@xmath1 emission profile .",
    "the eso ntt observations used the eso multi mode instrument ( emmi ) , with the light path split into two arms optimized for observations in the blue and red respectively .",
    "our observations were made in the blue arm where the detector was a tektronix ccd having @xmath31 pixels .",
    "the scale along the slit was @xmath32 per pixel ; with a slit width of @xmath33 and eso grating 3 we achieved a spectral resolution of 2.8  .",
    "observations at the wht were made with the blue arm of the isis spectrograph .",
    "a @xmath31 tektronix ccd was used , giving a scale along the slit of @xmath34 per pixel . with a slit width of @xmath35 and grating r1200b ,",
    "the spectral resolution was 1.7  . at the aat",
    ", the rgo spectrograph was used with a @xmath31 tektronix ccd .",
    "the spatial scale along the slit was @xmath36 per pixel , and a @xmath37 slit and 1200b grating gave a spectral resolution of 1.5   ( see also rttgering et al .",
    "important parameters for the different observing sessions are summarized in table 1 , where we give the dates of the different sessions , telescopes and instruments , achieved resolutions and an indication of the observing conditions .",
    "the objects were positioned in the slit using blind offsetting from nearby `` bright '' stars .",
    "due to inaccuracies in the blind offsetting  offsets were sometimes @xmath38  the measured line fluxes may be slightly lower than those measured from our low resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the objects that we observed are listed in table 2 , with the relevant total exposure times , slit position angles and cross - reference to the sessions in table 1 .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded , sky - subtracted and wavelength- and flux - calibrated using the longslit package in the iraf reduction software of the u.s . national optical astronomy observatory .",
    "in the following subsections we shall derive various properties and parameters of the ly@xmath1 spectra .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra are shown in fig .",
    "they have been smoothed slightly with a gaussian function of @xmath39   fwhm to enhance the most extended ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using apertures which included all extended ly@xmath1 emission visible in fig .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "4 . spatial profiles of the ly@xmath1 emission , summed over the full spectral range where ly@xmath1 emission was detected , are in fig .",
    "the profiles have been smoothed with a gaussian function of @xmath40 fwhm .      from the spectra it is immediately clear that many of the radio galaxies have a double- or multi - peaked ly@xmath1 velocity profile .",
    "the troughs between the peaks have widths of several hundred kilometres per second and in most of them no emission is detected from the bottom of the troughs .",
    "however , in several cases the depth of the troughs change with spatial location ; a good example of this is 0200 + 015 , where one end of the trough is shallower than the other ( see also below ) .",
    "because of the steepness of the deepest troughs and the relatively smooth overall velocity profile of ly@xmath1 emission , we conclude that the troughs are unlikely to be caused by genuine velocity structure of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas but are caused instead by the absorption of ly@xmath1 photons by neutral hydrogen very close in redshift .",
    "the troughs appear deeper on the one - dimensional spectra of fig .",
    "4 than on the smoothed two - dimensional ones ( fig .",
    "1 ) , consistent with the absorption features being relatively narrow . the profiles of the deep troughs in the ly@xmath1 profiles appear similar to strong absorption lines observed in the spectra of distant qsos .",
    "most of the qso absorption lines at such redshifts are interpreted as arising in neutral hydrogen clouds between us and the qso .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the troughs in the ly@xmath1 emission profiles of our radio galaxies are also due to hi absorption systems .",
    "although dust mixed through the emission line gas can also effectively absorb ly@xmath1 emission due to the large pathlength of the resonant scattering ly@xmath1 photons , dust would not be expected to produce such a narrow absorption feature but the entire ly@xmath1 emission profile would be depressed and have a more chaotic structure ( e.g. 0211@xmath25122 , see below and van ojik et al .",
    "we therefore conclude that the deep troughs in the ly@xmath1 emission profiles are caused by hi absorption .    in some cases where the s /",
    "n is relatively low , we can not exclude the possibility that the double peaked profile is caused by two separate velocity components of the ionized gas .",
    "however , since these profiles are very similar to the profiles with good s / n in which a sharp hi absorption trough is observed , we conclude that the double peak in ly@xmath1 profiles observed with lower s / n are also probably due to hi absorption .",
    "we will model the ly@xmath1 profile assuming that the underlying ly@xmath1 emission line has a gaussian velocity profile and that the troughs are due to hi absorption characterised by voigt profiles .",
    "we used an iterative scheme that minimized the sum of the squares of the differences between the model and the observed spectrum ( see also rttgering et al .",
    "input parameters for this scheme are initial estimates for the redshift , strength and width of the unabsorbed gaussian emission line and estimates of the redshifts , doppler parameters and column densities ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and n(hi ) ) of the absorption systems .",
    "most objects show only one obvious absorption feature , but in a few cases there are several ( 0200 + 015 , 0828 + 193 , 2202 + 128 ) . the iterative scheme solved for the parameters of the model and we thereby derived the best fit shape of the gaussian emission line and the redshifts , column densities and doppler parameters of the hi absorbers .",
    "the modelling of the troughs was not always satisfactory .",
    "if an absorption feature appears too complex to be one single absorber , but more likely consists of several absorbers close to each other in redshift , the best fit from the model fitting procedure is not unique and the derived parameters should be treated with caution .",
    "features in the spectra that are not sharp troughs but are more like `` shoulders '' in the profile are observed in several objects with the best s / n spectra .",
    "these `` shoulders '' may not be hi absorption but could be due to true velocity structure in the emitting gas . in spite of these possible small deviations from a gaussian emission profile ,",
    "the gaussian approximation appears to be a reasonable description of the overall underlying emission profiles .",
    "modelling these `` shoulders '' in the ly@xmath1 profile with hi absorption requires large doppler parameters ( @xmath43 km s@xmath14 ) and relatively low hi column densities ( n(hi ) @xmath44 @xmath5 ) .",
    "large doppler parameters imply macroscopic motion of the absorbing gas , as a thermal origin would require a gas temperatures of @xmath45 k for @xmath46 km s@xmath14 and @xmath47 k for @xmath48 km",
    "s@xmath14 ( see also section 4 ) . to ensure that the iterative scheme did not diverge for those objects with a `` shoulder '' in the ly@xmath1 profile and a strong narrow ( n(hi ) @xmath49 @xmath5 ) absorption feature",
    ", such broad `` shoulders '' were also modelled by hi absorption . in the section on individual objects",
    "we illustrate these difficulties for a few cases .    the one - dimensional ly@xmath1 profiles and the adopted model - fits of the objects are displayed in fig .",
    "the derived parameters ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and n(hi ) ) of the absorption systems are listed in table 3 . in this table @xmath50",
    "is the redshift of the peak of the original emission line profile ( assumed gaussian ) that was modelled with the iterative fitting of emission and absorptions .",
    "the absorbers for each object are numbered in order of the hi column density , @xmath51 being the redshift of the strongest hi absorption system in an object .",
    "the redshifts of the emission and absorbers were determined after converting the wavelengths to vacuum values and have an estimated accuracy of @xmath52 .",
    "the resultant width of the original ( unabsorbed ) ly@xmath1 emission line is listed in table 4 , which lists all determined parameters of the ly@xmath1 emission .      from the two - dimensional spectra",
    "the spatial extent of the ly@xmath1 emission regions varies from @xmath35@xmath53 between the sources .",
    "we can define a total extent by simply measuring the maximum extent to which ly@xmath1 emission is seen at @xmath54 level in fig .",
    "1 . we denote this extent by d@xmath55 . however , this measure is not a good indicator of the scale size of the ly@xmath1 extent because the spectra have different integration times and sensitivities .",
    "furthermore , the flux level of the most extended ly@xmath1 emission may depend on the central ly@xmath1 flux of an object and thus could be below the detection limit of our spectra for the objects with low ly@xmath1 luminosity . to obtain a more robust measure of the ly@xmath1 extent ,",
    "we have extracted spatial profiles of the ly@xmath1 by summing the columns over the wavelength range where ly@xmath1 was detected in fig .",
    "1 . from these spatial profiles",
    "we define a scale size of the ly@xmath1 emission , d@xmath56 , as the extent between the spatial points where the ly@xmath1 emission flux is 20% of the peak level .",
    "this 20% level is chosen because it can still be measured reliably in the spectra with the lowest s / n ratio in our sample .",
    "both d@xmath56 and d@xmath55 are listed in table 4 .",
    "we can estimate the mass of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas from the integrated ly@xmath1 luminosity as measured from our spectra .",
    "after obtaining the density of the ionized gas assuming case b recombination through @xmath57 erg s@xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath58 is the total volume occupied by the emission line gas and @xmath59 the volume filling factor of the gas , the mass in ionized gas is m@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the volume filling factor of the ionized gas must be estimated because we have no means of determining it directly for our hzrgs . from direct measurements , using sulphur lines , of the density of line emitting gas in low redshift radio galaxies , filling factors in the range 10@xmath6110@xmath62 and typically of order @xmath63 have been deduced @xcite .",
    "we will assume this value for the ly@xmath1 emission line regions of our hzrgs .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of the ionization of the ly@xmath1 emission line region in hzrgs see e.g. mccarthy et al .",

    "( 1996 ) . calculating the volume of the measured ly@xmath1 emission from the defined d@xmath64 and the width of the slit and taking the depth of the ly@xmath1 region the same as the transverse size ( i.e. the slit width ) we find that the masses of ly@xmath1 emitting gas in the radio galaxies of our sample are are typically a few times 10@xmath65 m@xmath9 ( see table 4 ) .      when examining the two - dimensional spectra it is apparent that in many cases the spatial position of the maximum intensity of the ly@xmath1 emission varies as a function of wavelength . in some cases",
    "the peak position changes smoothly with wavelength ( e.g. 0748 + 134 ) while in others it varies in a more irregular manner ( e.g. 0828 + 193 , 2202 + 128 ) .",
    "we have measured this spatial position of the maximum ly@xmath1 intensity per wavelength bin ( s@xmath66(@xmath67 ) ) , where the extent of a wavelength bin varied from 24 pixels to obtain a reasonable s / n per bin so that the position could be determined with an accuracy of no worse than a few tenths of an arcsecond .",
    "note that these measurements of the spatial position of the maximum intensity of ly@xmath1 at different wavelengths ( s@xmath66(@xmath67 ) ) is not the same as used to measure velocity structure in spectra , where at every spatial position the wavelength of the maximum intensity of the emission line profile is determined ( thus @xmath68(s ) ) .",
    "for the objects with brightest ly@xmath1 the position variations were measured on the unsmoothed frames , while the fainter were measured from the smoothed frames of fig .",
    "1 . the errors on the positions depend on the s / n level of the ly@xmath1 emission in each wavelength bin .",
    "the regions of the spectra where a strong hi absorption is present were excluded .",
    "the galaxy 1707 + 105 was excluded from these measurements because it has at least two spatial maximums at the position of two galaxies situated along the radio axis .",
    "we also give positional changes from the two - dimensional ly@xmath1 spectrum of radio galaxy 1243 + 036 ( van ojik et al .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "6 .    from fig .",
    "6 we see that indeed most objects show significant changes in the spatial positions as a function of wavelength ( or velocity ) .",
    "the amplitude of these changes vary from a few tenths of an arcsecond to several arcseconds . in some spectra the spatial position changes gradually while some others have several spatial `` wiggles '' .",
    "we will parameterize the positional changes in two ways .",
    "the first is the amplitude , @xmath69s = s@xmath70s@xmath71 , which is simply the distance between the most extreme spatial positions of maximum ly@xmath1 intensity measured ( s@xmath72 and s@xmath71 ) , whose accuracy is still better than @xmath73 .",
    "this amplitude does not indicate whether there is a smooth gradient or if there are several discrete `` wiggles '' .",
    "therefore , we introduce another parameter that indicates the amount of `` wiggles '' in the positional changes relative to the velocity range over which the positions are measured .",
    "this `` wiggling index '' , @xmath74 , is ( an estimate of ) the number of different positional gradients along the velocity profile , @xmath75 ( or the number of times that the positional gradient changes , plus one ) , divided by the velocity range ( @xmath76 , in thousands km s@xmath14 ) of the interval measured .    in table 4",
    "we list all measured ly@xmath1 properties . in this table",
    "we have also included the additional objects 1243 + 036 ( van ojik et al .",
    "1996 ) , 0943 - 242 @xcite and 4c41.17 @xcite from which similar high resolution spectra have been published . in some cases we found that the ly@xmath1 fluxes at high resolution were smaller than those measured in the low resolution spectra @xcite from which the redshifts were determined .",
    "various factors can contribute to this discrepancy , e.g. differing seeing or photometric conditions , or small errors in the telescopes blind offsetting for the high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "therefore the objects for which we have determined the ly@xmath1 fluxes only from the high resolution spectroscopy are marked in table 4 .",
    "due to the large sizes of the ly@xmath1 emission regions , it is likely that the limited width of the slit ( @xmath33 ) of the spectrograph did not cover the entire transverse extent of the ly@xmath1 emission ( see e.g. 1243 + 036 ) .",
    "we estimate that the true ly@xmath1 fluxes of the galaxies may well be a factor 2 higher than those determined from our high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the columns give the following parameters : ( 1 ) the source name ( 2 ) the velocity width ( fwhm ) of the gaussian fitted to the ly@xmath1 emission profile ( section 3.1.1 ) ( 3 ) indication whether strong hi absorption ( @xmath49 @xmath5 ) is present : 1 : yes ; 0 : no ( 4 ) 20% projected linear size of the ly@xmath1 emission region ( 20% of the peak level in fig .",

    "this will illustrate that in at least some of these systems there is clear observational evidence that dust , broad emission lines or accompanying galaxies play an important role .",
    "it will also illustrate some of the limitations of the fitting procedure that we applied to obtain parameters of the absorption systems .",

    "* 0211@xmath25122 * : this radio galaxy has a peculiar optical spectrum in which the ly@xmath1 emission is anomalously weak compared to the higher ionization lines .",
    "this anomaly has been interpreted as being produced by dust mixed through the emission line gas which partly absorbs the ly@xmath1 emission @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional high resolution spectrum of the ly@xmath1 shows a clearly different structure than the rest of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "there is one small region with strong ly@xmath1 emission that is relatively narrow ( 300 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) and is responsible for more than one third of the flux .",
    "furthermore , there are several weaker patches of ly@xmath1 emission distributed around the bright peak .",
    "the bright narrow peak is spatially offset by @xmath78 from the peak of the continuum emission .",
    "this somewhat peculiar two - dimensional ly@xmath1 profile is consistent with the interpretation of van ojik et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that dust is mixed through the ly@xmath1 emitting gas of 0211@xmath25122 .",
    "the bright narrow peak may be a region where the dust content is sufficiently low so that the ly@xmath1 photons can escape .",
    "in spite of the different appearance of the velocity field , the integrated line profile does show a double peaked shape .",
    "although this double peaked appearance may be produced by dust within the ly@xmath1 region , it is also possible that an hi absorption system plays a role .",
    "if we model the observed profile as being due to hi absorption of an originally gaussian profile , we obtain a fit as displayed in fig .",
    "2 with a very narrow ( @xmath13700 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) ly@xmath1 having a strong hi absorption of column density n(hi)=10@xmath79 @xmath5 . however , the centre of this absorption is not as opaque as it should be with such a strong absorption ( see also the two - dimensional spectrum in fig .",
    "there is more ly@xmath1 emission from the bottom of the trough than in any of the other galaxies with strong hi absorption .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that this simple model is correct .",
    "an alternative fit is given by a less luminous original emission profile , thus ignoring most of the emission from the bright narrow peak and giving an hi column density of @xmath80 @xmath5 ( displayed in fig .",
    "however , this fit is also not well matched to the observed profile .",
    "it may be that the profile is purely due to dust mixed with the ionized gas , extinguishing the resonant scattering ly@xmath1 photons , although we can not exclude that hi absorptions contribute to the shape of the ly@xmath1 profile of 0211@xmath25122 .",
    "* 0828 + 193 * : the ly@xmath1 profile has a spectacular shape .",
    "the emission is very strong but drops steeply on the blue side of the peak , while slightly further bluewards some ly@xmath1 emission is visible again .",
    "thus , it appears that almost the entire blue wing of the ly@xmath1 emission profile has been absorbed .",
    "also the most extended and fainter emission shows the same sudden drop at 4343  . this is a remarkable radio galaxy that has a close ( @xmath81 ) companion along its radio axis @xcite .",
    "the presence of a close companion , from which no ly@xmath1 emission is detected , suggests that a neutral gaseous halo of this galaxy might be responsible for the absorption of the blue wing of the ly@xmath1 emission from 0828 + 193 .",
    "however , it is not certain that the companion is at the same redshift , because no emission lines are detected .",
    "also in the red wing of the ly@xmath1 profile , a broad shoulder is observed that may be due to multiple hi absorption systems or may be caused by intrinsic velocity structure of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas .",
    "the steepness of the absorption trough next to the ly@xmath1 peak requires the absorber to have an hi column density of @xmath82 @xmath5 .",
    "but the broadness of the absorption , extinguishing nearly all emission in the blue wing of ly@xmath1 , requires the doppler parameter for a single absorber to be @xmath83 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this fit is displayed in fig .",
    "this absorption fit has removed too much of the original ly@xmath1 profile , as there is clearly emission observed just blueward of the sharp drop to zero at @xmath84  .",
    "thus , the absorption may be due to the combination of several absorption systems at slightly different velocities with respect to the ly@xmath1 peak .",
    "the few small emission peaks that are left of the ly@xmath1 blue wing , are significant and can be well modelled by assuming three distinct absorbers ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . the main absorber has a column density of @xmath85 @xmath5 and the other two are @xmath86 @xmath5 with more reasonable doppler parameters of 16 to 80 km s@xmath14 .",
    "although the absorption may be even more complex , this model is the simplest one that gives a satisfactory fit so we adopted these values",

    "1357 + 007 * : this galaxy which is associated with a small ( @xmath87 ) radio source has a deep trough in the ly@xmath1 profile .",
    "the ly@xmath1 profile has a relatively low s / n .",
    "the one - dimensional spectrum of this object is a good example for demonstrating the difference between modelling the troughs as being due to hi absorption and as being due to true velocity structure .",
    "the limitations of the models are illustrated by comparing the best fits obtained by a two velocity component emission model ( fig .",
    "3 ) with those from an absorption model ( fig .",
    "the fit of the ly@xmath1 emission profile by a combination of two gaussian emission profiles at different velocities is less satisfactory than the hi absorption model .",
    "this is because the trough between the two peaks on the profile is steeper than the wings on the outside of the emission peaks .",
    "although we can not exclude the possibility of a non - gaussian but symmetric double peaked emission profile , this difference in steepness of the trough and the outer wings of the emission profile is accounted for by a voigt absorption profile which is also the best fit for the troughs in the profiles with the best s / n .",
    "the actual situation may be more complicated than implied by the idealized assumptions of the models , but it seems that also in 1357 + 007 hi absorption is the more plausible interpretation in spite of the lower s / n ratio than in our best spectra .    * 1436 + 157 * : this is a quasar ",

    "there is no direct evidence that the galaxy is at the same redshift as the quasar ; only the quasar shows strong ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "apart from very broad ly@xmath1 emission and strong continuum , as is common for quasars , the ly@xmath1 has a spatially extended narrow component .",
    "this is why we include it in our sample .",
    "a strong hi absorption feature is present in the narrow line component over the entire ly@xmath1 extent .",
    "the extended ly@xmath1 emission is larger than the radio source .",
    "part of the emission may be due to the companion galaxy or a tidal interaction if the companion galaxy is indeed associated with the quasar .",
    "the strong hi absorption feature in the narrow line ly@xmath1 component requires a very large doppler parameter of @xmath13200 km s@xmath14 when modelled by one single absorber .",

    "the ly@xmath1 luminosity of the objects and the ly@xmath1 velocity width show no significant correlation ( fig .",
    "a notable feature from this plot is that the average ly@xmath1 luminosity of the radio galaxies with strong associated hi absorption is about a factor @xmath93 lower than those without a strong associated hi absorber .",
    "although this suggests that the hi systems might be responsible for absorbing @xmath94% of the ly@xmath1 flux , the large dispersion in the luminosities ( the errors on the mean luminosities of both samples are more than a factor of 2 ) , this difference is not statistically significant .    in fig .",
    "9 we show a histogram of the relative velocity of the strong absorption systems with respect to the peak of the original ( gaussian ) ly@xmath1 emission profile as obtained from the modelling .",

    "we find that we would have clearly distinguished the hi absorption systems in the ly@xmath1 profiles out to velocities of almost half the fwhm of the ly@xmath1 emission , i.e. 450700 km s@xmath14 . in the spectra with the highest s / n",

    "but , although @xmath69s does not show an apparent correlation with the largest linear size ( i.e. measured along the radio axis ) of the radio source , there is a ( weak ) correlation ( 96.5% from a spearman rank analysis ) with the transverse size ( projected size perpendicular to the radio axis ) of the radio source ( fig .",
    "it appears that the radio sources with larger transverse sizes tend to have larger ly@xmath1 shifts .",

    "this implies that the actual relation would probably be stronger if the true transverse sizes of these sources were known .",
    "a strong correlation ( @xmath99% ) exists between the distortion index of the radio ( @xmath90 ) , and the ly@xmath1 `` wiggling index '' ( @xmath98 ) ( see fig .",
    "thus , the sources with the most distorted radio morphologies also show the most `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 peak position .",
    "distortion of radio sources , i.e. bending and multiple hot spots , increases the transverse size of a radio source , producing the correlation between @xmath69s and the transverse radio size .",

    "the ly@xmath1 emission can be divided into two components : an `` inner halo '' which has dimensions smaller than the radio source and which has a large velocity dispersion ( 7001600 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) , and an `` outer halo '' , outside the radio structure , which is relatively quiescent ( @xmath102 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) .",

    "mccarthy et al . ( 1991 ) found that the extended emission line gas of 3c radio galaxies ( median redshift 0.4 ) is generally asymmetric and brightest on the side of the radio lobe closest to galaxy nucleus , which also tends to be the brightest radio lobe ( 46 out of 70 ) . in our sample of high redshift ( @xmath2 ) radio galaxies , 7 of the 17 galaxies have clearly asymmetric ly@xmath1 emission regions , i.e. the surface brightness of the extended ly@xmath1 emission is larger on one side of the galaxy than on the other .",
    "only 3 of these 7 have the brightest extended ly@xmath1 emission on the side of the closest radio lobe and thus do not show the correlation with lobe arm length asymmetry that mccarthy et al . (",
    "1991 ) found for the 3c galaxies ( 37 out of 39 ) .",

    "we note that the statistics of our sample are poor with only 7 measured asymmetric emission line regions against 39 galaxies of mccarthy et al .",
    "one of the reasons why we do not find the same asymmetry correlation may be because the extended emission line regions of hzrgs are usually much larger and smoother , sometimes larger than the radio sources , than those of the intermediate redshift 3c sample of mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , who also noted this difficulty in measuring the asymmetry of ly@xmath1 in hzrgs .",
    "another possibility is that the inconsistency is due to the fact that we measure the ly@xmath1 emission , while mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) measured the extent of [ oii]@xmath673727 .",
    "different mechanisms may determine the spatial distribution of ly@xmath1 and [ oii ] emitting gas .",
    "it has been suggested that the emission line gas in radio galaxies may be responsible for the depolarization of the radio emission ( e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "1985a and 1985b and references therein ) .",
    "the depolarization of the radio emission is also often observed to be asymmetric @xcite .",
    "a strong anti - correlation between asymmetric depolarization of the radio emission from quasars with the side of the quasar on which the radio jet is observed @xcite and large rotation measures of the polarized radio emission in hzrgs @xcite have been interpreted as evidence that a hot ( @xmath103 k ) magnetoionic halo surrounding the objects causes the depolarization and that the asymmetry is caused by the orientation of the radio source in the hot halo .",
    "if the depolarization of the radio emission is caused by the emission line gas or an associated hotter gas component , one would expect that asymmetry of the extended emission line regions would correspond to asymmetric depolarization of the radio emission . for most of the galaxies in our sample high resolution radio polarization measurements",
    "have been carried out by carilli et al .",
    "most of the radio galaxies have asymmetric polarization , where one radio lobe is much more depolarized than the other .",
    "polarization information is available for only 5 of the 7 sources with asymmetric ly@xmath1 emission in our sample . in only 2 of these 5",
    ", the fractional polarization is lowest on the side of the most extended ly@xmath1 emission , indicating that line asymmetry  polarization asymmetry at least does not have a strong correlation .",
    "however , this result is statistically too poor to indicate whether the ly@xmath1 emitting gas plays an important role in the depolarization of radio emission in our sample of hzrgs or not .",
    "several authors have argued that the large equivalent width of the ly@xmath1 emission as well as the line ratios of the emission lines associated with radio galaxies in general are not well reproduced by shock ionization nor by hot stars and that anisotropic photoionization by an obscured nucleus appears to be the dominant mechanism of ionization @xcite . in our sample of hzrgs",
    "we have found a strong relation between the radio size and ly@xmath1 size , which suggests that the radio plasma interacts with the ambient gas .",
    "shock ionization associated with the impact of the radio jet and with the expansion of the radio lobes might explain this direct size relation .",
    "however , the spatial emission profiles show that ly@xmath1 emission is strongest near the center of the galaxies and decreases rapidly with distance in the halo , instead of being brightest at the extremities where the radio lobe has just passed .",
    "furthermore , the presence of ly@xmath1 emission from the region outside the radio structure in more than half our objects can not be produced by shocks associated with the radio sources , but argues strongly for photoionization of the emission line gas by a central continuum source .",
    "the relation between the sizes of ly@xmath1 and the radio source must be produced by a different mechanism ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "we conclude that the ly@xmath1 emission line region is most likely produced by ( anisotropic ) photoionization by a central continuum source .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas in our sample of hzrgs varies from @xmath137001600 km s@xmath14 .",
    "such large velocity dispersions were already known from low resolution studies ( see mccarthy 1993 and references therein ) and are similar to the velocity dispersion of extended ly@xmath1 emission seen in some radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "interaction between the radio source with the emission line gas has been suggested as a cause for high velocity dispersions in radio galaxies the @xcite . in the high redshift quasars , heckman et al .",
    "( 1991 ) were unable to establish a definite connection between the velocities of the extended emission line gas in quasars and the radio source .",
    "they note that such large velocity dispersions may also have a gravitational origin if gas is falling in from large radii in the process of galaxy formation ( see also fall & rees 1985 ) .",
    "apart from the velocity dispersions we have observed detailed velocity structure in the ly@xmath1 emission line region .",
    "we have found that in several of the individual objects the velocity profile shows small deviations from a gaussian profile ( `` shoulders '' on the wings of the profiles ) and occasionally there are signs of rotation .",
    "furthermore , the spatial position of the maximum intensity of ly@xmath1 often varies with wavelength ( `` wiggles '' ) .",
    "these features in the velocity structure indicate that the ly@xmath1 emission line region is not one system with purely chaotic gas motions , but also contains some large scale motions .",
    "we have found several strong correlations between the velocity structure of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas and the properties of the radio source : ( i ) an anti - correlation between the size of the radio source and the velocity dispersion of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas .",
    "the smaller radio sources have larger ly@xmath1 velocity dispersion .",
    "( iii ) the number of `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 position with wavelength correlates with the amount of distortion of the radio structure .",
    "( ii ) the component of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas that is extended beyond the radio source has a lower velocity dispersion than the gas inside the radio structure .    as noted by heckman et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and fall & rees ( 1985 ) , the high velocity dispersions typically found in hzrgs can be gravitational in origin . if the radio galaxies are at the bottom of a deep potential well , i.e. a dense cluster , gas falling in from large radii can reach velocities of more than 1000 km s@xmath14 . individual infalling gas regions , ionized by the active nucleus as they come near the center of the radio galaxy , could also produce spatial `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 velocity structure .",
    "however , such a gravitational origin of the ly@xmath1 velocity structure does not produce any of the observed correlations with the radio source properties .",
    "furthermore , the relatively constant velocity dispersion inside the radio structure and the sudden decrease outside the radio source , is inconsistent with a gravitational infall scenario .",
    "the three correlations indicate that the kinematics of the ly@xmath1 are connected with the radio source .",
    "we have earlier presented convincing evidence that the radio source accelerates and disturbs the emission line gas in the radio galaxy 1243 + 036 ( van ojik et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this galaxy",
    "the radio jet is bent at the position of an `` accelerated '' region of emission line gas .",
    "further , 1243 + 036 has a quiescent ( 250 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) outer ly@xmath1 halo , while inside the radio source the ly@xmath1 emitting gas has a large velocity dispersion ( 1575 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) .",
    "our current observations have provided two more objects ( 0200 + 015 , 0828 + 193 ) where the velocity dispersion of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas outside is lower than inside the radio structure .",
    "similar quiescent ly@xmath1 gas is also present outside the radio structure in 4c41.17 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the interaction of the radio plasma with the gas in our hzrgs is responsible for the large velocity dispersions inside the radio structure and the spatial `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 velocity structure .    on the basis of spectroscopy of low redshift radio galaxies , baum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) classified these radio galaxies in three kinematical classes : ( i ) rotators , associated with recent mergers , ( ii ) calm non - rotators that are identified with cooling flows and ( iii ) violent non - rotators , that have optical and radio morphologies similar to the rotators , but whose kinematics are dominated by large chaotic gas motions overshadowing any signs of rotation . because of the similarities in their optical and radio properties , baum et al .",

    "1996 ) we found `` calm '' rotational kinematics of the ly@xmath1 gas outside the radio structure , while inside the radio plasma the ionized gas has a large ( 1500 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) velocity dispersion and the kinematics are dominated by chaotic motions . in the rest of our sample of hzrgs",
    "there is often ly@xmath1 emission extended beyond the radio structure with apparently a lower velocity dispersion , but these outer halos do not show signs of rotation , except in 0200 + 015 . in this galaxy",
    "the ly@xmath1 emitting gas extending beyond the radio source appears to have a velocity shear at least on one side of the galaxy where the hi absorption also remains present over the same extent .",
    "using the criteria of baum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) none of these galaxies would classify as rotators , because the kinematics are dominated by large turbulent motions and evidence for rotation is only weakly present in a few cases .",
    "the interpretation of 1243 + 036 ( van ojik et al .",
    "1996 ) that turbulence induced by the propagating radio source `` washes out '' the signs of rotation , and the few hints of rotation in several galaxies with lower than average gas velocity dispersions , supports the idea of baum et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the low redshift radio galaxies , that the rotators and violent non - rotators are linked .",
    "hence , all our powerful high redshift radio galaxies may well have originally had rotating gas halos , due to a galaxy interaction or from the accretion of gas from the primeval environment .",
    "however , any clear rotation signature has been washed out by large turbulent motions due to interaction with the propagating radio plasma .",
    "our observations show that high redshift radio galaxies often have very strong and extended hi absorption systems seen against their ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "evidence of such absorption was given by the observations of hippelein & meisenheimer ( 1993 ) , who imaged the ly@xmath1 emission of 4c41.17 using a fabry  prot system .",
    "they found a relatively weak hi absorption , of @xmath44 @xmath5 column density , with a projected size of @xmath104 kpc@xmath18 , covering a part of the ly@xmath1 emission region of 4c41.17 at @xmath105 .",
    "they interpret this absorption as due to a fortuitously intervening ly@xmath1 forest absorption .",
    "a small hint of this absorption is visible in the high resolution spectrum of chambers et al .",
    "the strong absorptions that we find in our sample of radio galaxies appear to be different from the weak absorption in 4c41.17 in that they are more than 3 orders of magnitude stronger and up to 5 times more spatially extended .",
    "our observations show that in the cases where strong absorption ( n(hi ) @xmath106 @xmath5 ) is seen against the ly@xmath1 emission of the radio galaxy , the absorber extends over the entire size of the emission line region with observed projected sizes up to @xmath107 kpc . however , the strength of the absorption is not always the same over all spatial scales .",
    "the largest ly@xmath1 emitting regions with hi absorption show more ly@xmath1 emission from the bottom of the absorption trough ( e.g. 0200 + 015 ) than the objects with small ly@xmath1 emission regions ( e.g. 2202 + 128 ) .",
    "the depth of the absorptions over such different scales indicates that the covering factor of absorbing material must be close to unity over scales of @xmath1320 kpc , and still of the order of 0.9 on @xmath1350 kpc scales .    from the sizes and derived column densities of the absorbers and assuming that the size of the absorbers along the line of sight is the same as the observed transverse size , we find that the mass in neutral hydrogen of an absorption system is m(hi)=10@xmath65 @xmath108 m@xmath9 , where @xmath109 kpc is the average size the absorption systems in our sample and @xmath110 @xmath5 the characteristic hi column density .",

    "although the conditions in the extended absorption systems in our hzrgs may be different from those in the line of sight to quasars , they are shielded from the direct ionizing radiation from the radio galaxy .",
    "the range of ionization parameters found for the gas in hi absorption systems by bergeron & stasiska ( 1986 ) that are assumed to be ionized by the intergalactic uv radiation field , is the same as that estimated in the narrow emission line regions of quasars and radio galaxies ( see mccarthy 1993 ) , although the ionization source is different .",

    "the volume filling factor of the absorption systems is :    @xmath126    however , the absorption systems may contain more ionized than neutral hydrogen , which would imply a higher volume filling factor . from the typical mass in hi of the absorption systems , @xmath127 m@xmath9 , and the ratio of total hydrogen mass to hi mass defined as @xmath128 m(h)/m(hi ) the volume filling factor is :    @xmath129    although this is only a crude estimate of the filling factor , depending very much on the external pressure , the temperature of the absorbing gas and on the assumed geometry of the absorption systems , we adopt the value of @xmath130 to estimate the sizes of the individual clouds .",
    "the size of an individual cloud is estimated by @xmath131 .",
    "this size can be derived since we know the covering fraction of the clouds in the absorption system @xmath132 to be close to unity . for a typical absorption system size of 35 kpc ,",

    "if the individual clouds are not spherical but filamentary , as may be likely , the number of such clouds would change , but the derived size would be the average size of individual clouds along the line of sight .",
    "the large doppler parameters that are often required for an optimum fit to the absorption profiles are too large to be only due to thermal motions of the gas , because they would imply gas temperatures of @xmath135 k. the width of the absorption lines may be due to a superposition of a large number of absorbing clouds covering the velocity range or be due to macroscopic gas motions in the absorbing clouds . we can estimate the velocity dispersion of the gas from the doppler parameter and the temperature of the gas , where @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the mass of hydrogen and @xmath138 is the gas velocity dispersion ( see cowie and songaila 1986 ) . assuming a maximum temperature of the absorbing gas of 10@xmath17 k , for doppler parameters 50200 km s@xmath14",
    "the gas velocity dispersion @xmath138 is 35140 km s@xmath14 .      from the statistics of quasar absorption lines ,",
    "the chance of a random intervening absorber with column density larger than 10@xmath139 @xmath5 in the small redshift interval of the ly@xmath1 emission line ( @xmath140 ) is only @xmath1323% ( e.g. petitjean et al . 1993 ) .",
    "our sample of high redshift radio galaxies has a high incidence of @xmath1360% of such strong associated absorption , and even @xmath1390% of the radio sources with radio size smaller than 50 kpc .",
    "thus these absorption systems are much more common than in quasars and can not be random intervening absorbers , but must be intrinsic to the radio galaxies or their direct environment .",
    "one possibility might be that a strong absorption is caused by the gaseous halo of a neighbouring galaxy if the radio sources reside in clusters .",
    "there is evidence from some damped ly@xmath1 absorption systems ( briggs et al .",
    "1989 ) and from the statististics of ly@xmath1 absorption in the line of sight of gravitationally lensed qsos that high redshift galaxies may have halos of more than 10 kiloparsec ( e.g. smette et al . 1992 and references therein ) . assuming that cluster galaxies have a hydrogen halo size of 35 kpc ( the average size of the observed extent of the hi absorbers and consistent with the size estimates derived from the statistics of ly@xmath1 absorptions in qsos ) and a typical cluster size of 1 mpc",
    ", this would imply @xmath141 such galaxies to cover all lines of sights to the radio galaxy .",
    "such a density of galaxies with large hydrogen halos in a cluster around the radio source seems unlikely .",
    "furthermore , the typical velocity dispersion in low and intermediate redshift clusters is @xmath142 km s@xmath14 .",
    "however , the hi absorption systems in our hzrgs are almost always within 250 km s@xmath14 of the peak of the ly@xmath1 emission profile ( see section 3.3 , fig .",
    "alternatively , the absorption may be caused by a large tidal remnant of an interaction with a companion galaxy ( rttgering et al 1996b ) .",
    "however , it is implausible that , even if all our radio galaxies have had an interaction , such tidal remnants would in 6090% of the cases be exactly located in our line of sight to the ly@xmath1 emission and covering its entire extent .",
    "furthermore , if quasars are in similar cluster environments as radio galaxies , one would expect a similar high incidence of associated absorptions in quasars if they are caused by cluster galaxies or tidal remnants , which is not observed .    in orientation - based unification models radio galaxies and radio loud quasars",
    "are regarded as intrinsically similar objects , viewed from different angles ( see antonucci 1993 ; barthel 1989 and references therein ) . due to an obscuring torus of dust and gas surrounding the active nucleus ,",
    "the radiation from the nucleus can only be observed within a cone which is oriented along the radio axis .",
    "this anisotropic radiation ionizes the gas clouds in its path resulting in an extended emission line region . in quasars",
    "the radio / cone axis is oriented close to the line of sight and we therefore observe the bright ionizing continuum and broad - line emission region close to the nucleus , while in radio galaxies the nucleus is obscured so that we can not observe the ionizing radiation directly .    in this scenario , both quasars and radio galaxies must have a large envelope of gas surrounding the entire systems . in radio galaxies",
    "the ionizing cone is close to the plane of the sky and we see the emission line region from the side",
    ". our line of sight to the ly@xmath1 emission region would pass through the region of gas outside the cone of ionizing radiation ( see fig .",
    "this gas is not affected by the propagating radio plasma , that is presumed to have stirred up the emission line gas , causing high velocity dispersions .",
    "this much more quiescent gas outside the ionizing cone is the most likely cause of the strong absorption in the ly@xmath1 emission line profiles .",
    "if indeed both the ly@xmath1 emitting gas and the absorbing gas are components of the extended gaseous envelope of the galaxy , it would also explain why in all observed cases the absorption systems extend over the entire ly@xmath1 emission region .",
    "suggestive evidence for this interpretation is also that the estimated masses for the amount of emission line gas are roughly similar to the estimated total masses ( neutral and ionized gas ) of the absorption systems ( typically a few times 10@xmath65 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "the presence of hi outside the ionization cone has been directly observed in the low redshift ( @xmath143 ) seyfert 2 galaxy ngc5252 @xcite .",
    "we note that although this interpretation may work as a general picture for the hzrgs , there are several individual cases where the situation must be more complicated ( e.g. 1243 + 036 , 0828 + 193 , 1436 + 157 ) .",
    "the presence and strength of hi absorption in an individual case may also depend on e.g. the total amount of gas present in a radio galaxy , the power of the nuclear ionizing continuum , differences in cone opening angle and the presence of an extra ( isotropic ) ionization source ( starburst ) and interaction with companion galaxies .",
    "if the gas of the absorption systems is indeed from the same gaseous envelope as the ly@xmath1 emitting gas , the high covering factor ( 0.91 ) of the absorbing gas does not imply that the gas located within the ionization cone has the same high covering factor in clouds that are _ optically thick _ to the nuclear ionizing continuum radiation . if the degree of ionization increases by a factor of 10 inside the ionization cone , the covering fraction of optically thick clouds would decrease to @xmath144 , the value that is estimated for extended ly@xmath1 emission observed in high redshift radio loud quasars @xcite .",
    "note that this same mechanism probably causes the `` inverse '' or `` proximity '' effect in quasars , where there is a strong decrease of the number of ly@xmath1 absorption systems close to the redshift of the quasars ( e.g. murdoch et al .",
    "1986 ; lu et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "it is interesting that , although there does not seem to be a large excess of associated absorption in qsos in general , there is a tendency for associated absorption to occur preferentially in steep spectrum radio loud quasars @xcite .",
    "the incidence rate of associated absorptions in radio loud quasars is about 16% within 2000 km s@xmath14 of the quasar redshift .",
    "radio loud quasars also have more extended line emission than radio quiet qsos @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest that both radio loud galaxies and radio loud quasars at high redshifts reside in denser environments than radio quiet and flat spectrum objects .",
    "furthermore , their larger relative velocities and lower occurrence rate compared to the associated absorption in our sample of hzrgs suggests that they may not have the same origin and are more consistent with being due to neighbouring cluster galaxies rather than being intrinsic to the quasars themselves .",
    "we note that the associated absorption systems in these radio galaxies are quite different from the broad ( several thousands km s@xmath14 ) absorption line systems that are observed in some quasars .",
    "a comparison of optical with infrared measurements show that high redshift radio galaxies have a ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio lower than was expected for case b recombination by a factor of 210 @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted as being most likely due to dust mixed with the emission line gas , selectively destroying the resonant scattering ly@xmath1 photons .",
    "other evidence for the presence of dust comes from optical polarization measurements , that indicate that much of the extended continuum light may be scattered continuum radiation from an obscured agn @xcite .",
    "our observations of the ly@xmath1 profiles have shown that neutral hydrogen is present in many hzrgs and can absorb @xmath1350% of the original ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "thus , the low observed ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratios are at least in part due to associated hi absorption systems ( see also rttgering et al .",
    "1995a ) .",
    "we note that to effectively destroy ly@xmath1 emission by dust , the dust must be distributed homogeneously through the ionized gas . because of the low volume filling factor of the emission line gas , a ly@xmath1 emission region with low dust content or non - homogeneous dust distribution will produce strong ly@xmath1 emission from the galaxy .",
    "the radio galaxy 0211@xmath25122 appears to be an exceptional case where the dust distribution meets this stringent geometrical requirement well enough to effectively extinguish most of the ly@xmath1 emission ( see van ojik et al .",
    "while very little dust distributed homogeneously can extinguish all ly@xmath1 emission , for different geometries galaxies could contain large amounts of dust without destroying the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "differences between the distribution of dust and ly@xmath1 emitting gas are not unlikely because dust is probably produced by star formation in the galaxy itself and transported outwards into the gaseous halo while the ly@xmath1 halo gas may well originate from accretion from the primeval environment .",
    "the geometrical requirement of hi absorption of ly@xmath1 is much less stringent than for absorption by dust .",
    "the hi clouds must be non - uniformly distributed around the emission line gas and located in our line of sight to reduce the observed ly@xmath1 emission flux .",
    "only if neutral gas clouds were exactly uniformly distributed around the radio galaxies , the observed flux in our line of sight would not be reduced , in spite of the random scattering of the ly@xmath1 photons in the hi clouds .",
    "thus , because of the presence of associated hi absorption in hzrgs , which reduces the observed ly@xmath1 flux , the dust content of hzrgs derived from the h@xmath1/ly@xmath1 ratio may have been overestimated . in the near future , more accurate polarization measurements with 8-metre class telescopes and continuum measurements with new mm - wavelength instrumentation and the iso satellite along with spectroscopy of more ir emission lines , will be crucial to determine the true dust content of these primeval galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable results from our study relate the ly@xmath1 emission and absorption to the radio properties of high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "firstly , the small radio sources almost always have strong associated hi absorption .",
    "the large radio sources show very little associated hi absorptions and have narrower ly@xmath1 velocity widths .",
    "secondly , there is a strong anti - correlation between the radio size and velocity width of ly@xmath1 .",
    "thirdly , there is a strong correlation between the radio size and the size of the ly@xmath1 emission region .",
    "the bigger radio sources have larger ly@xmath1 emission regions associated with them .",
    "fourthly , variations in the spatial position of the maximum intensity of ly@xmath1 as a function of wavelength ( `` wiggles '' ) correlate with the amount of distortion of the radio morphology .",
    "these relations between the ly@xmath1 and radio properties are strong evidence for a kinematic interaction between the radio jet and the ambient gas . in the case of 1243 + 036",
    "there is direct and convincing morphological evidence for vigorous interaction between the radio source and the ly@xmath1 gas ( van ojik et al .",
    "we note that a similar relation between radio power and [ oiii ] width was noted by heckman et al .",
    "( 1981 ) for low redshift radio sources and seyfert galaxies and was taken as evidence for a radio  gas interaction .    as we have argued in section 4.1 , shock - ionization associated with",
    "the expansion of the radio lobes is probably not the cause of the ly@xmath1 size ",
    "radio size correlation , because there are several indications that the ly@xmath1 is mainly ionized by a central continuum source .",
    "the radio plasma may have another effect on the ambient gas , namely to increase the amount of ly@xmath1 emission from the region inside the radio lobes by the mechanism suggested by bremer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : because the luminosity depends on the volume filling factor of the gas , interaction of the radio jet and turbulence in the radio lobes may rip apart neutral cores of emission line clouds therefore increasing the filling factor , exposing more gas to the ionizing continuum and increasing the ly@xmath1 emission . outside the radio structure , gas ( with lower filling factor )",
    "can also be photoionized but ly@xmath1 emission is at a lower flux level .",
    "this mechanism has the advantage that it can explain the radio size ",
    "ly@xmath1 size relation , without the inconsistencies of a shock - ionization interpretation ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "the `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 position as a function of wavelength indicate that there are large regions of gas having velocities different from the mean velocity at different positions with respect to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 position usually occur on scales of less than an arcsecond , while the distortions of the radio structure tend to be large scale phenomena . in several objects",
    "the radio source has double hot spots at its extremities , at @xmath145 kpc from the nucleus while the ly@xmath1 `` wiggles '' are within 5 kpc of the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this indicates that , although the ly@xmath1 `` wiggles '' correlate with the degree of distortion of the radio sources , they do not necessarily coincide spatially .",
    "possibly , interaction of the radio jet with the ionized gas near the centre of the galaxy at an earlier epoch has resulted in the current radio distortions on larger scales , while the current ly@xmath1radio interaction induces a future bent morphology and multiple hot spots of the radio source .",
    "apart from the possible nature of the `` wiggles '' in the ly@xmath1 position as a function of wavelength and the relation between ly@xmath1 size and radio size which were discussed above , we need to explain the correlations of the radio size with the velocity dispersion of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas and the presence of associated hi absorption .",
    "we propose three different scenarios , one environmental , one evolutionary and one based on orientation :    * 1 . *",
    "_ environmental scenario _ the environment of a massive galaxy in which a radio source resides , will influence the size evolution and morphology of the radio source and the observed ly@xmath1 properties . in a dense ( proto - cluster ) environment a radio source will vigorously interact with the ambient gaseous medium .",
    "kinetic energy will be transferred from the radio source to the gas , increasing the velocity dispersion of the gas and reducing the propagation speed of the radio source .",
    "therefore the radio source stays relatively small .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission from the gas that is ionized by photoionization and possibly shocks shows strong hi absorptions from the dense gas in the direct environment . in a low density environment",
    ", the propagating radio source will encounter much less resistance and reach to a large size .",
    "there will be relatively little interaction with the environment , a smaller velocity dispersion and no clouds large and dense enough to produce strong hi absorption of the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "this would be consistent with the work of baum et al .",
    "( 1989 ) who at low redshifts finds that the smaller powerful 3c sources are generally more depolarized , have more complex emission line morphologies and more distorted radio structures . fifty percent of these objects are known to be at the centers of rich ( cooling flow ) clusters .",
    "the larger 3c radio galaxies have more normal polarization and less distortion .",
    "these galaxies are isolated or reside in small groups of galaxies , where there may be less material to interact with .",
    "thus the coincidence of larger ly@xmath1 velocity dispersion and hi absorption with the smaller and sometimes more distorted radio structures in our @xmath2 sample , may be evidence that these galaxies are at the centers of dense ( proto-)clusters . the larger radio sources have simpler ly@xmath1 kinematics and no strong absorptions and they are probably more isolated galaxies or reside in less dense clusters .    in a denser environment one might expect the ly@xmath1 luminosity to be higher because this scales strongly with the density of the emission line gas ( the ly@xmath1 luminosity scales as @xmath146 erg s@xmath14 , where @xmath147 is the density of the gas , @xmath59 the volume filling factor and @xmath58 the volume occupied by the emission line gas , see mccarthy et al .",
    "we do not find any evidence for such a correlation in our observations .",
    "however , not only the gas density but also the total volume of an emission line region determines the ly@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "while the environment of the larger radio sources has a lower density , the sizes and therefore the volume occupied by the ly@xmath1 emission line region is much larger than for the smaller sources .",
    "therefore the total ly@xmath1 luminosity of the larger sources may not be very different from the smaller sources .",
    "furthermore , the presence of strong hi absorption also reduces the observed ly@xmath1 luminosity of the smaller sources . finally ,",
    "also the large variation of the ly@xmath1 luminosities ( by a factor of 30 between the individual objects ) makes it difficult to any possible evidence of a correlation between the density of the environment and the ly@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "* 2 . * _ evolutionary scenario _ in this scenario the small radio sources are at different stages in their evolution than the larger radio sources . as the radio source propagate outwards it first encounters a dense gaseous medium whose velocity dispersion is increased via transfer of kinetic energy from the radio jet and we observe a small radio source with ly@xmath1 emission of relatively large velocity width .",
    "the dense parts of the gaseous medium that have not ( yet ) been affected by the interaction with the radio source would produce strong absorption in the ly@xmath1 emission . as the radio source propagates further outwards there is less interaction as the ambient density decreases with radius and the radio jet has cleared a path through the denser inner parts of the galaxy s halo .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas then reduces due to dissipation and less direct interaction with the radio source .",
    "the main problem of this evolutionary scenario is to explain the decrease of extended hi absorption clouds as the radio source propagates outwards . in the case of shock ionization",
    "the clouds may become ionized as the boundary of the radio lobe passes through the neutral gas .",
    "however , as described above , shock ionization is unlikely to be dominant enough to ionize the hi absorption systems .",
    "furthermore , the possible disruption of the neutral clouds by the passage of the radio lobes will not prevent them from producing hi absorption features , because the gas will still be shielded from the central ionizing continuum .",
    "_ orientation scenario _ a third way of producing the observed correlation between the projected radio and ly@xmath1 size and the anti - correlation with the velocity dispersion of the gas might be in the context of the orientation - based unification schemes of quasars and radio galaxies ( as explained earlier ) .",
    "close to the active nucleus the velocity dispersion of the gas is high ( many thousands of kilometres per second ) , while further out the gas velocities decrease .",
    "smaller radio sources have their radio axes oriented preferentially closer to our line of sight . in that case",
    "we would also see a smaller emission line region and , as we observe closer into the nuclear region , we may see more gas with a larger velocity dispersion .",
    "this scenario however does not explain why smaller radio sources ( oriented towards our direction ) are more likely to have extended hi absorption than larger ones ( those closer to the plane of the sky ) .",
    "we should then also observe associated hi absorption in quasars as frequently as in radio galaxies , which is not the case .",
    "in fact the opposite would be more likely in an orientation scenario , if the absorbing gas is outside the cone of ionizing radiation from the agn .",
    "west ( 1993 ) has argued that the radio axis of radio galaxies and quasars may actually be oriented along the direction of mass distribution in ( proto ) clusters and that the formation of clusters and their brightest galaxy would occur through infall along this direction .",
    "if this is the case there would be more mass present along the direction of the radio axis so for objects whose axes are oriented closer to our line of sight there would be more ( neutral ) gas in the absorbing path .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the velocity dispersion in a cluster is of the order of 1000 km s@xmath14 while the strong hi absorptions are much narrower and almost always within @xmath96 km s@xmath14 of the ly@xmath1 emission peak ( fig .",
    ".    a possible indication of the angle between the radio axis and our line of sight would be the radio core fraction ( e.g. browne & perley 1986 ; browne & murphy 1987 ) . for",
    "radio sources oriented closer to our line of sight it is expected that the radio flux from the core is a larger fraction of the total radio flux than for radio sources oriented closer to the plane of the sky .",
    "we see no evidence for a such relation between the ly@xmath1 velocity dispersion and the radio core fraction ( tables 4 and 5 ; see also carilli et al .",
    "this suggests that orientation effects do not play an important role in the observed correlations .    because of the problems that the evolutionary and orientation scenario have with explaining the presence of strong hi absorption preferentially in the smaller radio sources , we favour the environmental explanation for the observed velocity  size correlation .",
    "additional evidence for the importance of environmental effects comes from observations of 1243 + 036 at @xmath27 where the morphological correspondence between the radio and the ly@xmath1 emission indicates that there is clear vigorous interaction between the radio source and the surrounding gas ( van ojik et al .",
    "thus we find that it is likely that many steep spectrum hzrgs reside in a dense environment , possibly a ( proto ) cluster .",
    "our high resolution spectroscopic study of ly@xmath1 emission in high redshift radio galaxies has shown the following : 1 ) the ly@xmath1 velocity profiles show considerable detailed structure much of which is indicative of hi absorption .",
    "2 ) strong hi absorption with column densities 10@xmath13910@xmath79 is found against the ly@xmath1 emission in 11 of 18 objects .",
    "almost all our galaxies ( 9 out of 10 ) with ( projected ) radio sizes smaller than 50 kpc , have strong hi absorption . for the galaxies with larger radio sources , there is only occasional evidence for associated hi absorption 3 ) the hi absorbers are spatially extended over the entire ly@xmath1 emission region , indicating that they have a covering fraction near unity over a region of @xmath1350 kpc .",
    "4 ) the overall ly@xmath1 kinematics are dominated by turbulent motions . only in a few cases",
    "there is a hint of large scale organized dynamics , possibly rotation . on smaller scales",
    "the ly@xmath1 spectra there is also evidence that the kinematics are not purely chaotic , such as `` shoulders''in the velocity profile and `` wiggles '' in the spatial position of the maximum intensity of ly@xmath1 as a function of velocity .",
    "5 ) the ly@xmath1 emission is usually sharply peaked near the centre of the radio galaxy and the ly@xmath1 emission often extends beyond the size of the radio source . the detected extent of the ly@xmath1 emission regions range from 15 to 135 kiloparsec .",
    "6 ) there is a strong correlations between the radio size and the ly@xmath1 size and a strong anti - correlation between the radio size and the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas .",
    "the smaller radio sources have larger gas velocity dispersions and smaller emission line gas regions than the larger radio sources .",
    "7 ) the amount of `` wiggling '' of the ly@xmath1 position as a function of velocity correlates strongly with the amount of distortion of the radio source morphology and the amplitude of the wiggling correlates with the transverse radio size .",
    "these observations have the following implications : a ) the frequent occurrence of strong hi absorption systems is much too large to be caused by random intervening absorbers .",
    "the absorbers must be directly associated with the radio galaxy or its environment .",
    "b ) on the basis of orientation - unification scenarios of radio galaxies and quasars , the hi absorption systems may well be due to gas from the gaseous halo of the galaxy , situated outside the ionization cone",
    ". halos of neighbouring cluster galaxies or tidal tails from galaxy interactions seem very unlikely causes for the hi absorptions .",
    "c ) the large velocity dispersions of the ionized gas and the wiggles in the ly@xmath1 peak spatial position as a function of velocity are best explained as due to interaction of the radio plasma with the gas .",
    "d ) the correlation between ly@xmath1 properties and radio properties and the frequent presence of associated hi absorption indicate that hzrgs are located in dense environments .",
    "the smaller radio sources most likely reside in the densest ( cluster ) environments , where large amounts of neutral gas are present and most interaction with the radio source occurs .",
    "transfer of kinetic energy from the radio jet to the gas increases the gas velocity dispersion and reduces the propagation speed of the radio source .",
    "there is considerable scope for following up on these observations .",
    "first , it is important to make similar measurements in a range of position angles and not just confined to the radio position angle .",
    "secondly , more detailed imaging of the ly@xmath1 halos will help delineate the geometry of the individual ly@xmath1 halos .",
    "thirdly , hst imaging and spectroscopic observations will allow the details of the gas and its kinematics to be studied in the important nuclear regions .",
    "fourthly , small high redshift radio sources with large gas velocity dispersions and strong associated hi absorptions are excellent targets in searching for clusters of galaxies in the early universe .",
    "one intriguing question that remains is what role the gas clouds play in galaxy evolution .",
    "the typical sizes of 40 lightdays deduced for individual clouds are comparable with that of the solar system .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that these clouds are intimately associated with the early formation stages of individual stars and that they delineate a fundamental phase in galaxy evolution .",

    "the two - dimensional high resolution spectrum of the ly@xmath1 shows a clearly different structure than the rest of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "there is one small region with strong ly@xmath1 emission that is relatively narrow ( 300 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) and is responsible for more than one third of the flux .",
    "furthermore there are several weaker patches of ly@xmath1 emission distributed around the bright peak .",
    "the bright narrow peak is spatially offset by @xmath78 from the peak of the continuum emission .",
    "this somewhat peculiar two - dimensional ly@xmath1 profile is consistent with the interpretation of van ojik et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that dust is mixed through the ly@xmath1 emitting gas of 0211@xmath25122 .",
    "the bright narrow peak may be a region where the dust content is sufficiently low so that the ly@xmath1 photons can escape . in spite of the different appearance of the velocity field ,",
    "the integrated line profile does show a double peaked shape .",
    "although this double peaked appearance may be produced by dust within the ly@xmath1 region , it is also possible that an hi absorption system plays a role .",
    "if we model the observed profile as being due to hi absorption of an originally gaussian profile , we obtain a fit as displayed in fig .",
    "2 with a very narrow ( @xmath13700 km s@xmath14 fwhm ) ly@xmath1 having a strong hi absorption of column density n(hi)=10@xmath79 @xmath5 . however , the centre of this absorption is not as opaque as it should be with such a strong absorption ( see also the two - dimensional spectrum in fig .",
    "1 ) . there is more ly@xmath1 emission from the bottom of the trough than in any of the other galaxies with strong hi absorption .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that this simple model is correct .",
    "an alternative fit is given by a less luminous original emission profile , thus ignoring most of the emission from the bright narrow peak and giving an hi column density of @xmath80 @xmath5 ( displayed in fig .",
    "however , this fit is also not well matched to the observed profile .",
    "it may be that the profile is purely due to dust mixed with the ionized gas , extinguishing the resonant scattering ly@xmath1 photons , although we can not exclude that hi absorptions contribute to the shape of the ly@xmath1 profile of 0211@xmath25122 .",
    "* 0355@xmath25037 * : the ly@xmath1 profile is smooth and shows no signs of hi absorptions .",
    "apart from the brightest ly@xmath1 emission , there is low surface brightness ly@xmath1 emission extending over about @xmath23 in the north - western direction , i.e. the direction of the brightest radio lobe .",
    "* 0417@xmath25181 * : although the spectrum has relatively low s / n , the ly@xmath1 emission has a deep and wide trough over its entire spatial extent of @xmath1342 kpc . in the red part of the ly@xmath1 emission on the two - dimensional spectrum",
    ", there is a hint of another small absorption system . on the spectrum ,",
    "the faint continuum of a galaxy at @xmath152 north of 0417@xmath25181 is also visible .        *",
    "0828 + 193 * : the ly@xmath1 profile has a spectacular shape .",
    "the emission is very strong but drops steeply on the blue side of the peak , while slightly further bluewards some ly@xmath1 emission is visible again .",
    "thus , it appears that almost the entire blue wing of the ly@xmath1 emission profile has been absorbed .",
    "also the most extended and fainter emission shows the same sudden drop at 4343  . this is a remarkable radio galaxy that has a close ( @xmath81 ) companion along its radio axis @xcite .",
    "the presence of a close companion , from which no ly@xmath1 emission is detected , suggests that a neutral gaseous halo of this galaxy might be responsible for the absorption of the blue wing of the ly@xmath1 emission from 0828 + 193 .",
    "however , it is not certain that the companion is at the same redshift , because no emission lines are detected .",
    "also in the red wing of the ly@xmath1 profile , a broad shoulder is observed that may be due to multiple hi absorption systems or may be caused by intrinsic velocity structure of the ly@xmath1 emitting gas .",
    "the steepness of the absorption trough next to the ly@xmath1 peak requires the absorber to have an hi column density of @xmath82 @xmath5 .",
    "but the broadness of the absorption , extinguishing nearly all emission in the blue wing of ly@xmath1 , requires the doppler parameter for a single absorber to be @xmath83 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this fit is displayed in fig .",
    "this absorption fit has removed too much of the original ly@xmath1 profile , as there is clearly emission observed just blueward of the sharp drop to zero at @xmath84  .",
    "thus , the absorption may be due to the combination of several absorption systems at slightly different velocities with respect to the ly@xmath1 peak .",
    "the few small emission peaks that are left of the ly@xmath1 blue wing , are significant and can be well modelled by assuming three distinct absorbers ( see fig .",
    "the main absorber has a column density of @xmath85 @xmath5 and the other two are @xmath86 @xmath5 with more reasonable doppler parameters of 16 to 80 km s@xmath14 .",
    "although the absorption may be even more complex , this model is the simplest one that gives a satisfactory fit so we adopted these values . the broad shoulder in the red wing is also modelled by hi absorption with a large gas velocity dispersion , but",
    "we can not exclude that it is caused by true velocity structure in the ly@xmath1 emitting gas .    *",
    "1357 + 007 * : this galaxy which is associated with a small ( @xmath87 ) radio source has a deep trough in the ly@xmath1 profile .",
    "the ly@xmath1 profile has a relatively low s / n . the one - dimensional spectrum of this object is a good example for demonstrating the difference between modelling the troughs as being due to hi absorption and as being due to true velocity structure .",
    "the limitations of the models are illustrated by comparing the best fits obtained by a two velocity component emission model ( fig .",
    "3 ) with those from an absorption model ( fig .",
    "the fit of the ly@xmath1 emission profile by a combination of two gaussian emission profiles at different velocities is less satisfactory than the hi absorption model .",
    "this is because the trough between the two peaks on the profile is steeper than the wings on the outside of the emission peaks .",
    "although we can not exclude the possibility of a non - gaussian but symmetric double peaked emission profile , this difference in steepness of the trough and the outer wings of the emission profile is accounted for by a voigt absorption profile which is also the best fit for the troughs in the profiles with the best s / n .",
    "the actual situation may be more complicated than implied by the idealized assumptions of the models , but it seems that also in 1357 + 007 hi absorption is the more plausible interpretation in spite of the lower s / n ratio than in our best spectra .    * 1410@xmath25001 * : this galaxy has a large ( 185 kpc ) associated radio source and very extended ly@xmath1 emission ( @xmath1380 kpc ) with no signs of strong hi absorption .",
    "however , it shows an obvious velocity shear in ly@xmath1 , that may well be due to rotation .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity shear is almost equal to the overall velocity width ( fwhm ) of the line .    *",
    "1436 + 157 * : this is a quasar ",
    "galaxy pair oriented along the radio axis ( like the galaxy - galaxy pair 0828 + 193 ) .",
    "there is no direct evidence that the galaxy is at the same redshift as the quasar ; only the quasar shows strong ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "apart from very broad ly@xmath1 emission and strong continuum , as is common for quasars , the ly@xmath1 has a spatially extended narrow component .",
    "this is why we include it in our sample .",
    "a strong hi absorption feature is present in the narrow line component over the entire ly@xmath1 extent .",
    "the extended ly@xmath1 emission is larger than the radio source .",
    "part of the emission may be due to the companion galaxy or a tidal interaction if the companion galaxy is indeed associated with the quasar .",
    "the strong hi absorption feature in the narrow line ly@xmath1 component requires a very large doppler parameter of @xmath13200 km s@xmath14 when modelled by one single absorber . although we can not exclude the possibility of an absorber with such a large intrinsic velocity dispersion , a better fit to the data is obtained by a model of two or more absorbers . in fig .",
    "3 the fit is shown that we obtain for two adjacent absorbers , each with an hi column density of about 10@xmath88 @xmath5 and doppler parameters of 1275 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we have also extracted a spectrum of the off - nuclear ly@xmath1 emission by only summing the spectra beyond a distance of @xmath35 from the peak of the continuum ( shown in fig .",
    "although there is still some contamination from the quasar continuum in this spectrum , the contribution of broad ly@xmath1 emission is negligible . to fit the off - nuclear profile , either a single absorber with large doppler parameter ( @xmath13250 km s@xmath89 ) is needed or more than one absorber . as a most plausible fit",
    "we have adopted a two absorbers model , whose parameters are in table 3 .      * 1558@xmath25003 * : this object shows no signs of hi absorption .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission line appears to have a broad component , especially in the red wing .",
    "this galaxy also shows signs of a velocity shear in the ly@xmath1 kinematics .    *",
    "1707 + 105 * : a galaxy with large associated radio sources and a companion galaxy along the radio axis .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission is very extended ( @xmath13130 kpc ) , where not only the radio galaxy itself ( a ) but also the companion galaxy ( b ) shows strong ly@xmath1 emission . on the opposite side of the radio galaxy",
    "is a region of faint ly@xmath1 emission with a relative blueshift that seems to increase with distance from the radio galaxy .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emitting gas has a relatively low velocity dispersion and shows no signs of hi absorption .    *",
    "2202 + 128 * : the radio and ly@xmath1 size of this galaxy are small",
    "( @xmath1335 kpc ) and the ly@xmath1 profile shows a strong hi absorption feature just bluewards of the peak and a somewhat weaker absorption feature in the red wing at 4518  .",
    "further the profile shows a flattened `` shoulder '' in the red wing ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    taking the small peak next to the absorption at 4518   to be real and assuming that the `` shoulder '' is also due to absorption , implies a very broad absorption ( doppler parameter @xmath154 km s@xmath14 ) . an alternative model ignoring the small peak next to the absorption at 4518   gives similar values for the two sharp absorptions as in the first model , but involves a much lower doppler parameter ( @xmath155 km s@xmath14 to account for the `` shoulder '' .",
    "it is possible that the shoulder in the red wing of the emission profile is indeed caused by an hi absorption system with a large intrinsic velocity dispersion or by a superposition of many small absorbers over this velocity range .",
