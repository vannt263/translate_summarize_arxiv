    "recently , there has been an effort to prove effective versions of scott s result by obtaining bounds on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to study the dependence of @xmath11 on two other notions of complexity ; the geometric self - intersection number @xmath12 of the curve , and , fixing a complete hyperbolic metric @xmath3 on @xmath2 , the length @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in the following two functions , defined in @xcite : @xmath14    in order to study these functions , we consider the relationship between the length and self - intersection number of closed curves on hyperbolic surfaces .",

    "with such a pants decomposition in hand , we obtain a natural decomposition of the curve into arcs ( see section [ sec : short metric prelim ] ) , and careful choices for lengths of pants cuffs are made so that the sum of the lengths of the constituent arcs can be controlled . the systole estimate arises naturally .",

    "this demonstrates the use of the systole estimate in the conclusion of theorem [ thm : shortest metric ] .",

    "in fact , it is possible to achieve the conclusion of theorem [ thm : lifts simply in n ] without resorting to the kind of length control obtained in theorem [ thm : shortest metric ] , an argument communicated to us by justin malestein @xcite .",
    "this argument uses the finiteness of the number of mapping class group orbits of incompressibly embedded roses on @xmath2 , and finds a curve in the mapping class group orbit of @xmath0 whose @xmath40-length can be controlled so that one may invoke ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1 ) directly . on the other hand , in addition to its independent interest , theorem [ thm : shortest metric ] includes fine control on the geometry of @xmath0 on @xmath2 , and this control can be used to deduce more information about degrees of curves .",
    "for instance , our proof of theorem [ thm : lifts simply in n ] also yields control over the dependence of degree on the euler characteristic of the underlying surface @xmath2 .",
    "precisely , we show :    there exists a function @xmath58 and a universal constant @xmath59 satisfying :    1 .   for any orientable surface @xmath2 of finite type , @xmath60 ; 2 .   for each @xmath61 , @xmath62 ; 3 .   for each @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the constant @xmath38 in the statement of theorem [ thm : shortest metric ] grows at most exponentially in the genus of the underlying surface @xmath2 ; indeed , examining each of the terms in the inequality at the beginning of the proof of theorem [ thm : shortest metric ] carefully , we see that @xmath38 depends polynomially on the constant @xmath65 in the statement of lemma [ self - intersection inequalities ] , which in turn depends quadratically on the constant @xmath66 in the statement of lemma [ jenya s pants ] . this last statement and the proof of lemmas [ jenya s pants ] and [ self - intersection inequalities ] in @xcite demonstrate an exponential upper bound for the growth of @xmath38 as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath0 a closed curve on @xmath2 with @xmath68 , theorem [ thm : shortest metric ] yields a hyperbolic metric with injectivity radius at least @xmath6 , for which @xmath0 has length @xmath69 for some universal constant @xmath70",

    "the discrepancy between the linear upper bound for @xmath41 in the compact case and the exponential lower bound in the cusped case arises from the change in the length of a closed curve on a compact hyperbolic surface as we let the lengths of boundary curves go to zero . as an application of the length estimate in theorem [ thm : difference in lengths ]",
