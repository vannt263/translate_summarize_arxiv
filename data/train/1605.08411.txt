    "the masses of the @xmath16 and @xmath11 need not be degenerate , and given a sufficient mass difference , the @xmath17 decay may compete with the @xmath15 decay . when the lighter higgs boson ( @xmath16 or @xmath11 ) is above the @xmath10 threshold then it can be expected to have a dominant decay to @xmath1 , leading to the final state @xmath12 .",

    "also the @xmath18 coupling depends only on the gauge coupling times a factor that is unity in the alignment limit of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) . here",

    "in the case that the lighter of @xmath16 or @xmath11 is below the @xmath10 threshold , the limits from the resulting cascade decay to @xmath20 have been considered in @xcite .",
    "first we calculate the model independent limits on the @xmath21 process from the atlas @xmath12 cross section measurement @xcite .",
    "second we use this process to constrain the masses in the 2hdm in the alignment limit .",
    "finally we consider the implications from the @xmath22 and @xmath7 decay modes when the pseudoscalar is consistent with the @xmath5 gev diphoton excess reported by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .      both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have multileptons searches which measure the sm @xmath12 production cross section at @xmath19 tev and also at @xmath23 tev @xcite .",
    "neither experiment sees a significant deviation from their sm expectations .",

    ", the @xmath19 tev data should provide useful limits on the process @xmath26 .",
    "the strongest limit is given by a particular region of the atlas @xcite search that has the following selection criteria :    * four anti-@xmath27 jets with @xmath28 gev , * three leptons with @xmath29 gev , * on @xmath30 selection within @xmath31 gev of the @xmath30 mass , * one @xmath32 tagged jet .",

    "we use a modified 2hdm feynrules model @xcite with herwig++ @xcite to generate our signal events .    for the @xmath11 production cross section we use the sm heavy higgs gluon - gluon fusion cross section @xmath33 from @xcite .",

    "the new heavy states are a chiral quark doublet @xmath88 and a chiral lepton doublet @xmath89 with sm charges .",
    "how such a extension of the sm is consistent with properties of the light higgs boson is discussed in @xcite",
    ". a four higgs doublet model is thought to emerge as an effective description of the fluctuations around the chiral condensates of the four flavors @xmath90 .",
    "the lighter of these bosons have a flavor content dominated by @xmath91 and @xmath92 and they form a set that is 2hdm - like . for these states",

    "this implies that @xmath95 .",
    "it also implies that while @xmath16 has an enhanced production from gluon fusion , @xmath11 has a suppressed production .",
    "we set @xmath96 gev and choose @xmath97 to avoid the @xmath98 decay . for the @xmath16 widths of most interest to the @xmath99 signal",
    "we find @xmath100 gev and @xmath1010.004 gev , corresponding to @xmath102375 gev .    from our results in fig .",
    "[ masterplot1 ] we see that @xmath38 around 650 gev can be consistent with these widths , namely the lower right corner of the allowed region in the @xmath103 gev plot .",
    "but then in addition we see that the top width @xmath104 needs to be reduced from its naive 2hdm value of @xmath105 gev . the @xmath106 coupling , along with other couplings of the bosons and their mass spectrum ,",
    "is ultimately determined by the multi - higgs potential .",
    "we find that parameters of this potential , partially already constrained by the light higgs properties , can be constrained further such that @xmath104 falls in the allowed range , e.g. @xmath107 gev .",
    "coupling need not be so suppressed and it tends to enhance @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath109 coupling is suppressed , but still the @xmath10 decay of @xmath11 dominates .",
    "] from the plot we also see how the @xmath10 resonance searches of cms and atlas differ on determining what this allowed range is . for larger @xmath38",
    ", the @xmath110 gev plot shows that the model parameters would have to be more tuned to obtain a sufficiently small @xmath104 .",
    "we turn now to the question of whether there can be direct limits due to the decay @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the @xmath111 decay and find an approximate upper limit from @xcite using checkmate . at @xmath112 gev",
    "we estimate that the cross section limit is @xmath113 pb for this final state , to be compared with the predicted value of @xmath114 fb when @xmath115 .",
    "gev , @xmath116 . ]",
    "we note that if the width of the @xmath117 is large ( for example @xmath118 gev ) , the branching ratio to @xmath119 where the @xmath117 is virtual can remain quite unsuppressed beyond @xmath120 gev . when this is the case then for such @xmath11 masses the corresponding plot of the type in fig .",
    "[ masterplot1 ] can continue to look like the @xmath103 gev plot ( but without the limit from @xmath121 ) .    in the benchmark model",
    "another possible decay mode is @xmath122 , and when kinematically open it can be a dominant decay mode that results in multilepton final states .",
    "we take the dominant heavy lepton decays to be @xmath123 ( rather than @xmath124 ) and @xmath125 ( @xmath126 would be even more striking ) .",
    "then there is a quite striking final state , @xmath127 the cross section limits for this process from the atlas four or more lepton search @xcite are approximately @xmath12890 fb when @xmath129 gev and @xmath130200 gev . given the size of @xmath131 and any sizable @xmath122 branching ratio , these data imply that the @xmath132 and @xmath133 masses are such that this cascade decay is either kinematically forbidden or at least kinematically suppressed .",
    "when the masses of additional higgs bosons are not degenerate , the @xmath134 final state offers a relatively model independent and clean probe of the heavy higgs sector . in the 2hdm ( at low @xmath74 and",
    "close to the alignment limit ) we found that it eliminates quite a large region of the @xmath38@xmath37 plane .",
    "in general any future search that is sensitive to the @xmath12 standard model background may also be sensitive to this signal .",
    "assuming that a 750 gev mass @xmath16 is the source of the diphoton excess observed by atlas and cms @xcite , we considered the impact of a lighter @xmath11 that leads to the decay @xmath135 .",
    "basically we find that the lighter the @xmath11 , the larger the @xmath99 width of the @xmath16 needs to be . in a benchmark model where the new fermions are @xmath136 and the @xmath99 width can not be arbitrarily large , we find that @xmath38 is constrained to a narrow range around @xmath137 gev . in this case",
    "the model predictions nearly saturate the bounds both from the @xmath138 sm search and the @xmath10 resonance search .",
    "the @xmath139 signal from the charged higgs decay may also be of interest .",
    "thus this picture should be quite testable as new lhc data emerge .",
