    "isospin symmetry in atomic nuclei is weakly broken mostly by the coulomb interaction that exerts a long - range polarization effect . capturing an equilibrium between long and short range effects",
    "is a challenging task possible only within _ no core",
    "_ approaches , which , in heavier nuclei , reduces possible choices to formalisms rooted in the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "however , as it was recognized already in the 70 s  @xcite , the self - consistent mean - field ( mf ) approaches can not be directly applied to compute isospin impurities because of spurious mixing caused by the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) effects .",
    "this observation hindered theory from progress in the field for decades .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a brief overview of recent theoretical results obtained within the isospin- and angular - momentum projected dft on isospin - mixing effects .",
    "our multi - reference _ no core _",
    "dft was specifically designed to treat rigorously the conserved rotational symmetry and , at the same time , tackle the explicit breaking of the isospin symmetry due to the coulomb field .",
    "the major physics motivation behind developing the model and studying the isospin symmetry breaking ( isb ) comes from nuclear beta decay .",
    "theoretical corrections to the superallowed fermi beta decay matrix elements @xmath1 between the isobaric analogue states , caused by the isb , are critical for precise determination of the leading element @xmath2 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) flavour - mixing matrix and , in turn , for further stringent tests of its unitarity , violation of which may signalize _ new physics _ beyond the standard model of particle physics , see  @xcite and refs . quoted therein .",
    "the formalism employed here starts with the self - consistent slater determinant @xmath3 obtained by solving skyrme - hartree - fock equations without pairing .",
    "the state violates both the rotational and isospin symmetries .",
    "the strategy is to restore the rotational invariance , remove the spurious isospin mixing caused by the isospin ssb effect , and retain only the physical isospin mixing due to the electrostatic interaction  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by a rediagonalization of the entire hamiltonian , consisting the isospin - invariant kinetic energy and skyrme force and the isospin - non - invariant coulomb force , in a basis that conserves both angular momentum and isospin @xmath4 , projected from the state @xmath3 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the standard isospin and angular - momentum projection operators  @xcite , respectively .",
    "one must also treat the fact that the quantum number @xmath8 is not conserved and set ( [ itbasis ] ) is overcomplete .",
    "this requires selecting the subset of linearly independent states , known as _ collective space _",
    "@xcite , which is spanned , for each @xmath9 and @xmath10 , by the so - called _ natural states _ @xmath11 @xcite and subsequently rediagonalizing the entire hamiltonian in the collective space .",
    "the resulting eigenfunctions are : @xmath12 where index @xmath13 labels the eigenstates in ascending order of energies .",
    "the isospin or coulomb impurities are defined as : @xmath14 where the sum extends over the norms corresponding to isospin @xmath10 that dominates in wave function ( [ ktmix ] ) .     isospin impurities in even - even @xmath15 nuclei calculated by using the sly4 skyrme edf  @xcite .",
    "full triangles mark the values calculated by using the isospin - projected dft .",
    "open triangles show mean - field values that are artificially quenched by the spurious isospin mixing .",
    "stars mark empirical results in @xmath16ge  @xcite and @xmath17zr  @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it is well known that for modern density - dependent skyrme and gogny energy density functionals ( edfs ) , the angular momentum projection is ill - defined  @xcite .",
    "hence , at present , the double - projected dft method can be safely used only with the functionals originating from the true hamiltonian . nevertheless , for all modern skyrme forces , the isospin - only - projected variant of the approach is free from singularities  @xcite .",
    "[ mixing ] shows the isospin impurities in the ground - states of even - even @xmath15 nuclei , calculated by using the state - of - the - art sly4 skyrme  @xcite edf in the isospin - only - projected variant of the model  @xcite .",
    "it is gratifying to see that the calculated impurities are consistent with the recent data extracted from the giant - dipole - resonance decay studies in @xmath17zr  @xcite and isospin - forbidden e1 decay in @xmath16ge  @xcite , see fig .  [ mixing ] .",
    "both data points disagree with the pure mf results , which , due to the spurious mixing caused by the spontaneous isb effects , are lower by almost @xmath1830% .",
    "the agreement with available data indicates that the model is capable of quantitatively capturing the intensity of the isospin mixing .",
    "this is important in the context of performing reliable calculations of the isb corrections to the fermi beta decay .",
    "the @xmath19 fermi @xmath0-decay proceeds between the ground state ( g.s . ) of the even - even nucleus @xmath20 and its isospin - analogue partner in the @xmath15 odd - odd nucleus , @xmath21 . since the isospin projection alone leads to unphysically large isospin mixing in odd - odd @xmath15 nuclei  @xcite , to calculate fermi matrix elements",
    "the double - projected method must be applied .",
    "as already mentioned , the angular momentum projection brings back the singularities in the energy kernels  @xcite , preventing one from using the modern parametrizations of the skyrme edfs and forcing us to use the hamiltonian - driven skyrme sv edf  @xcite .    the g.s.of the even - even parent nucleus is approximated by the state @xmath22 , projected from the slater determinant @xmath23 representing the self - consistent g.s",
    ".  mf solution , which is unambiguously defined by filling in the pairwise doubly degenerate levels of protons and neutrons up to the fermi level .",
    "the odd - odd daughter state is approximated by the state @xmath24 , projected from the self - consistent slater determinant @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) representing the so - called anti - aligned mf configuration , obtained by placing the odd neutron and odd proton in the lowest available time - reversed ( or signature - reversed ) single - particle orbits . the isospin projection from slater determinants manifestly breaking",
    "the isospin symmetry is essentially the only way to reach the @xmath27 states in odd - odd @xmath15 nuclei that are beyond the mf model space .",

    "this allows for rigorous fully quantal evaluation of the beta - decay transition matrix element and the corresponding isb correction @xmath30 : @xmath32 the calculated isb corrections @xmath30 lead to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for the sv and shz2 edfs , respectively  @xcite .",
    "both values result in the unitarity of the ckm matrix up to 0.1% .",
    "the new parametrization shz2 has been specifically developed to asses the robustness of our results with respect to the choice of interaction .",
    "this shows that although individual isb corrections are sensitive to the interplay between the bulk symmetry energy and time - odd mean - fields , the value of @xmath35 rather weakly depends on the parametrization .",
    "it is gratifying to see that our results are fully consistent with the results obtained by towner and hardy  @xcite , which were obtained within a different methodology , based on the nuclear shell - model combined with mean - field wave functions .",
