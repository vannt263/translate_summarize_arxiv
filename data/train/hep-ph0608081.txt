    "[ htp ]    -6 cm    at the time of the bes analysis , little was known about the coupling of @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and these channels were omitted from the fit to the data . since then , couplings to @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been determined by fitting ( a ) all available data on @xmath13 and @xmath2 , ( b ) kloe and novosibirsk data on @xmath14 [ 4 ] .",
    "all these data agree on a substantial coupling of @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the first objective of the present work is to refit the @xmath15 data including this coupling , following exactly the procedure of the bes publication .",
    "the outcome is to move the @xmath0 pole position from @xmath16 mev reported in the bes paper to @xmath17 mev .",
    "meanwhile , caprini , colangelo and leutwyler ( denoted hereafter as ccl ) have made a prediction of the @xmath0 pole position [ 5 ] .",
    "their calculation is based on the roy equation for @xmath3 elastic scattering [ 6 ] , which embodies constraints of analyticity , unitarity and crossing symmetry .",
    "this approach has the merit of including driving forces from the left - hand cut due to exchange of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath0 .",
    "they also apply tight constraints from chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) on the s - wave scattering lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 for isospins 0 and 2 .",
    "experiment alone determines only the upper side of the pole well ; this has led to speculation that fits without a pole might succeed in fitting the data [ 7 ] .",
    "ccl s use of crossing symmetry and analyticity gives a precise determination of the magnitude and phase of the s - wave amplitude on the lower side of the pole and leaves no possible doubt about its existence .",
    "they clarify the fact that @xmath3 dynamics are fundamental to creating the pole .",
    "they quote rather small errors : @xmath22 mev .",

    "the discrepancy lies in the mass range 550 to 950 mev . in this range ,",
    "the analysis is sensitive to assumptions about inelasticities due to @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "these are not known with sufficient accuracy at present and allow freedom in the analytic continuation of couplings to these channels below their thresholds .",

    "the effective range is proportional to @xmath140 as shown by weinberg [ 19 ] , so this relation is accurately consistent with all three fits . in this relation",
    ", @xmath141 is the pion decay constant .",
    "although the effect of systematic changes in inelasticity over the mass range from threshold to 1.15 gev provides a natural resolution of the discrepancy between bes data and the ccl prediction , alternatives have been suggested .",
    "two points have appeared in recent preprints .",
    "firstly , wu and zou [ 21 ] remark that the width fitted to @xmath11 is 195 mev compared with the value @xmath142 mev of the particle data group [ 22 ] .",
    "this discrepancy was also reported by dm2 [ 2 ] .",
    "wu and zou suggest that the strong process @xmath143 , followed by @xmath144 may contribute . in the original bes work ,",
    "the possibility @xmath145 was tried and gave little improvement and , at maximum , a contribution of 2% ( intensity ) of the data . in any case , the effect lies close to the vertical and horizontal @xmath60 bands of fig .",
    "1(a ) , particularly the region where they cross near the bottom left - hand corner of the dalitz plot .",
    "this is remote from the @xmath0 band ; changes to interferences between @xmath0 and @xmath60 , @xmath18 or @xmath146 have negligible effect on @xmath27 parameters .",
    "secondly , caprini [ 23 ] suggests that triangle graphs due to @xmath147 , followed by @xmath3 rescattering will introduce effects beyond the isobar model .",
    "although this is true , it is known that such effects vary logarithmically over the dalitz plot .",
    "there is no obvious reason why they should introduce a rapidly varying effect close to the right - hand edge of the dalitz plot .",
    "thirdly , could there be some form of background in @xmath148 ?",
    "if such a background is included as a quadratic function of @xmath34 , the discrepancy with ccl persists .",
    "the reason is that bes data determine the @xmath3 s - wave amplitude accurately above the @xmath10 as well as below it and limit it to small values ; this severely limits the form of any background to something close to the observed peak .",
    "in particular , a conventional form factor @xmath149 at the vertex for @xmath43 ( where @xmath150 is @xmath151 momentum in the @xmath152 rest frame ) gives no improvement , since it requires negative @xmath153 .",
    "so a background does not provide a simple escape route .",
    "a fourth possibility has been raised in discussions with ccl .",
    "this is that the form factor has a zero somewhere above 1 gev . extrapolating the full curve of fig .",
    "4 , there might in principle be a zero in the mass range around 1.3 gev .",
    "this would be obscured in the bes data on @xmath154 by the @xmath10 .",
    "however , there are also data on @xmath155 where the @xmath86 amplitude is clearly required [ 24 ] .",
    "the @xmath156 contribution in those data is sufficiently small that a zero in the @xmath86 amplitude can be ruled out definitively up to @xmath157 gev . at that mass ,",
    "the required radius of interaction would be unreasonably large , @xmath158 fm , and the @xmath0 pole region would be seriously distorted by the form factor .",
    "data on production of the @xmath116 pole in @xmath159 require an rms radius @xmath160 fm with 95% confidence [ 25 ] .",
    "there is a significant conflict in fig . 4 between the @xmath0 pole of ccl and bes data . in my view",
    ", the discrepancy needs explanation and the bes data should be taken at face value . the prescription adopted here in eqns .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) gives a natural improvement in fitting bes data without disturbing elastic phases up to 750 mev by more than @xmath134 in fit ( iii ) .",
    "this illustrates the ease with which the prediction of ccl may be modified to fit bes data .",
    "the strength of the bes data is that a peak is clearly visible .",
    "there is no significant @xmath6 signal .",
    "the bes data are therefore free of uncertainties about mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "the weakness of elastic scattering data is that there is no visible peak which can be checked , and there is a significant @xmath6 amplitude which must be separated .",
    "the bes data provide a better view of the upper side of the @xmath0 pole than elastic data , where the low mass tail of @xmath6 is uncertain .",
    "the ccl calculation provides a better view of its lower side , where constraints from chpt are valuable .    a more ambitious approach , beyond the scope of present work ,",
    "would be a solution of coupled channel roy equations for @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels , including the dynamics driving @xmath6 and @xmath86 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , from experience with the model of van beveren et al [ 19 ] , it is likely that uncertainties are presently too large to give a definitive prediction of the dynamics of @xmath6 and its delicate mixing with the @xmath0 .",
