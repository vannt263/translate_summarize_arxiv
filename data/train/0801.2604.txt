    "nanoclusters , with the exotic physical and chemical properties , have brought a big chance for future industry in many areas , it also challenges our current theories and models for traditional condensed matters.@xcite until now , many phenomena of nano - system still puzzle physicists , chemists and material scientists .",
    "undoubtedly , any precise description of cluster properties needs the correct structural models . to date",
    "few direct measurements of cluster structures are available experimentally,@xcite and much of the current theoretical understanding of cluster structures has been derived from atomic - scale molecular - dynamics(md ) and monte carlo(mc ) simulations.@xcite    in computer simulations , finding the most stable structure corresponds to search the global minimum of complicated multi - dimensional potential energy surfaces(pes).@xcite the potential energy surfaces of clusters are usually represented by an appropriate energetic model , such as that based on _ ab - initio _ method , tight - binding(tb ) models , or ( semi)empirical interaction potentials .",
    "the model clusters , described by lennard - jones(lj ) and morse potentials , have been studied extensively(e.g . ,",
    "refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "metal clusters are also widely studied using both dft and classical many - body potentials(e.g . ,",
    "refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the studies were even extended to large molecule systems@xcite and multi - matter system.@xcite many exotic structures , which is probably forbidden in bulk materials , have been reported in the previous studies .",
    "the excellent example includes , the cage structures of carbon,@xcite the icosahedra(_ih_)@xcite and decahedra(_dh_)@xcite based atomic shell structures of metal clusters , and the recent found cage structures of gold clusters,@xcite__etc__.    indubitably the cluster structures are determined by the details of the interatomic interaction .",
    "one of the current focuss is to examine the general structural effects of the different contributions to the interaction .",
    "doye and wales found that the friedel type oscillation in atomic potentials can strongly modulate the cluster structures.@xcite the original and mechanism of disordered structure in metal clusters were studied in term of the different many - body forms.@xcite baletto _",
    "et al _ have shown how the potential forms affect the crossover size between different structural motifs ( icosahedra , decahedra , and truncated octahedra).@xcite michaelian _",
    "et al _ have made a comparison of the global minimum structure for different many - body potentials.@xcite doye and wales investigated the structural consequence issue for a set of sutton - chen families of potentials.@xcite gong and his coworkers have studied the relativistic effect on the structure of gold clusters , which leads the presences of cage - like structures.@xcite    for studying the general effects of potential shapes on cluster structures , doye and wales suggested to consider a potential which is simple enough that one can comprehend the effects of any changes to its form .",
    "this method has been used to investigate the effect of the potential range and anisotropy on the cluster structures .",
    "et al _ first made the study on six- and seven - atom clusters bound by the morse potential for different interaction range.@xcite a similar study was preformed on other model potentials .",
    "rey and gallego have shown how the structures and melting behavior of hard - core yukawa clusters changing with the range of attractive yakawa tail.@xcite based on the generalized lj , morse , and born - mayer potentials , amano _ et al _ recently investigated the structure change with the potential shape.@xcite doye and wales made a systematic search of the pes of morse clusters as a function of the interaction range .",
    "they found that , decreasing the range results in destabilizing strained structures.@xcite the general trend have been used to explain the growth sequences of other systems.@xcite    despite substantial efforts by many researchers , our knowledge about the relationship between cluster structure and potential shape is still limited on a few factors , specially the effect of the interaction range .",
    "although the interaction range does play an important role for an interatomic potential , other factors also should not be neglected .",
    "obviously the further studies along this line are needed .",
    "another important factors could be the equilibrium pair separation(@xmath2 ) , which reflect the size of atoms .",
    "specially , for a fixed interaction range , how the equilibrium pair separation(@xmath2 ) affect the cluster structure is worthy to answered .",
    "physically , changing of @xmath2 corresponds to changing the atomic size .",
    "the importance of the atomic size issue has been shown in recent studies on @xmath3.@xcite in present paper , by introducing a simple model potential , which has the fixed interaction range but variable equilibrium pair separation , or equally speaking the atomic size , we have studied the effect of @xmath2 on the cluster structures .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the following section describes the new developed model potential and computational details .",
    "the cluster structures for a few selected parameters are presented in sec .",
    "the conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in sec .",
    "the potential we used was originally obtained from the effective pair potential@xcite of eam potential for iron,@xcite then we re - parameterize it in the current form :    @xmath4^{3}[\\gamma-1.44719(\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sigma}{\\displaystyle r_{ij}})];r_{ij}\\leq2.5\\sigma   \\\\",
    "0;r_{ij}>2.5\\sigma   \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "% \\ ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is energy and length unit respectively .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the distance between atom _",
    "j_. @xmath8 is an adjustable parameter , which determines the @xmath2 of the potential .",
    "the higher value of @xmath8 gives a shorter @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath5 is chosen to keep the potential well depth equal to one for each @xmath8 , and @xmath6 equals to one for all case studied .",
    "figure 1 shows the new potential with a few selected @xmath8 of 0.8,0.9,0.95,1.0,1.05,1.1,1,2 . for comparing",
    ", this figure also shows the morse and lj potential , where they have been fitted to have the same curvature at the bottom of the potential well as the present one . from this figure",
    ", one can see that , changing @xmath8 corresponds to the alternation of the equilibrium pair separation , also can be regarded as changing the atomic size . of course , by changing @xmath8 ,",
    "the stiffness of the potential is also changed , which is similar to the morse potential in this point .",
    "comparing to morse and lj potential , the new one is softer in repulsive part and stiffer in attractive part , and shorter in interaction range .",
    "another feature of the current potential is that it can make both fcc and bcc stable by varying @xmath8 .",
    "table 1 presents the cohesive energy of fcc and bcc phase as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the both fcc and bcc have the same energy at zero temperature at @xmath8=1 . for @xmath8 larger than one ,",
    "bcc phase is stable over fcc , while the smaller @xmath8 favors fcc phase .",
    "the reason is that , for large @xmath8 , the potential well becomes more and more flat . in this case , the dominated interaction in bcc is the both first and second nearest neighbors totally 14 atoms , while only 12 first nearest neighbors are contributed to energy in fcc due to the limited interaction range .",
    "it needs to point that the morse potential always make the fcc more stable over bcc .",
    "this is the major difference between the present potential and morse one .",
    "this potential is also similar to the johnson potential for bcc iron,@xcite which implies that this form may represent some major physics of bcc based metals .    to optimize the cluster structure ,",
    "we first search the global minimum among all the known structures for each potential and cluster size@xcite using the steepest - descent method .",
    "then we make further exploration for most stable structure with the generalized - simulated - annealing algorithm , which has been shown in previous work as a powerful and efficient procedure.@xcite the most stable structure then can be found among these structures .",
    "fig.2 plots the second difference of energy(@xmath9 ) as a function of cluster sizes for all studied @xmath8 . from top to bottom",
    ", it corresponds to the @xmath8 from 0.8 to 1.2 respectively . for size",
    "smaller than 24 , all the curves have the same trend .",
    "this implies that the structures are less dependent on the details of potentials at small sizes , which is similar to the case in morse potentials.@xcite for all @xmath8 expect 0.8 , around size from 135 to 147 , @xmath10 is almost equal to zero .",
    "this is because these clusters are based on @xmath11 cluster by taking a few atoms among its 12 vertex atoms .",
    "these vertex atoms are all equal due to the symmetry . as the size larger than 24 ,",
    "the differences of these curves begin to emerge .",
    "the curve of @xmath8=0.8 is evidently different from others for size larger than 23 .",
    "@xmath8=0.9 and 0.95 are similar each other in whole range of sizes .",
    "the major trends of @xmath8=1.0 , 1.05 , 1.1 and 1.2 are close in the most ranges .",
    "these differences are the reflection of different structure type as discussing below .",
    "peaks in @xmath10 correspond to clusters which are stable compared to adjacent sizes and have been found to correlated with magic numbers in mass spectra of clusters .",
    "we note that there are two types of peaks in @xmath10 .",
    "one type of peaks corresponds to especially stable clusters , such as n=13,55,147 , the closed - shell _ ih _ structures .",
    "another one is directly related to the change of structural types .",
    "for example , @xmath10 for @xmath8=0.8 has several this type of peaks for n@xmath12100 , which actually correspond to the close - packed ( _ cp _ ) clusters changing to the _ dh _ motifs .",
    "a few of structural types , @xmath13 , polytetrahedra(_pt _ ) , polytetrahedral involve an ordered array of disclinations(_pt - d _ ) _ ih _ , _ dh _ , _ cp _ and disordered(_dis _ ) structures , were found in present study . about these structures ,",
    "the detailed description can be found elsewhere,(e.g . ,",
    "refs.@xcite and references therein ) we briefly summary here .",
    "_ pt _ is made by packing five smallest tetrahedra sharing a common edge .",
    "the _ pt _ can further reduce its strain by involve an ordered array of disclinations(hereafter labeled as _ pt - d _ ) , where there are more than five smallest tetrahedra sharing a common edge . both _",
    "pt _ and _ pt - d _ can be naturally divided up into tetrahedra with atoms at their corners .",
    "_ ih _ can be decomposed into 20 fcc tetrahedra sharing a common vertex in the central site .",
    "a close - shell _ ih _ has 20 triangular fcc(111 ) faces and 12 vertices .",
    "a decahedron is made up of two pentagonal pyramids sharing a common basis .",
    "it has a single fivefold axis and is formed by five tetrahedra sharing a common edge along the fivefold axis . both _",
    "ih _ and _ dh _ can be have close geometry shell structure .",
    "_ cp _ is a pieces of fcc structure .",
    "the truncated octahedron is one of _",
    "cp_. by contrast , close - packed structures are composed of octahedra and tetrahedra .",
    "_ dis _ is that the clusters can hard be identified with any order structure .",
    "most _ pt _ clusters are observed at small sizes . specially all clusters less than 24 atoms are _ pt _ type , and most of them are identical for all @xmath8 at the same size .",
    "this means that the cluster structures are less relevant with the details of potential .",
    "fig.3 shows the small size _",
    "pt _ clusters of n=4 - 23 .",
    "these clusters are on a _ pt _ growth sequence . for example",
    ", the 7-atom cluster has a structure in the shape of a pentagonal bipyramid , which can be viewed as packing of five small tetrahedra by introducing some inherent strains .",
    "the clusters larger than seven atoms grow by introducing more new tetrahedra on its surface .",
    "_ growth sequence keeps and leads to the 13-atom cluster , which is commonly regarded as an icosahedron , however , it is also a _ pt _ according to hoare s description , and can be view as the packing of 20 small tetrahedra.@xcite the 19-atom cluster is packed by small tetrahedra on the surface of the 13-atom cluster .",
    "the clusters grow further by packing around the waist of the 19-atom cluster to larger clusters .",
    "the _ pt _ growth sequence is maintained and strain is also accumulated .",
    "there are a few clusters in the size range smaller than 24 , which did not follow the growth sequence described above , but still has pt structure .",
    "the exceptions are also listed in the fig.3 , which is n=8,21,23 for @xmath8=1.2,1.1 , and 0.8 respectively . for cluster with n=8 and @xmath8=1.2 , which is not the normal _ pt _ structure ,",
    "is the fraction of a bcc structure .",
    "n=8 cluster can also be viewed as a positive - disclination pt cluster(only four tetrahedra sharing a common edge ) , it has more positive strain than normal pt .",
    "fig.4 presents the extension of the _ pt _ growth sequence based on the small size clusters .",
    "34-atom cluster is complete form of the waist - packing pattern based on the 19-atom cluster .",
    "the larger _ pt _ clusters(@xmath14 ) are based on the 34-atom cluster , which is similar to the growth mode form 13-atom _ pt _ to 19-atom .    with increasing of cluster size ,",
    "the positive strain is also accumulated rapidly in _",
    "pt_. to reduce the positive strain , _ pt - d _ was observed .",
    "fig.5 presents a few selected _ pt - d _ clusters .",
    "this type of clusters has been discussed in several papers.@xcite _ pt - d _ structure is different from _ pt _ by introducing six tetrahedra share a common edge in some sites .",
    "although disclinations is unfavor in local , it does result in the decrease of global strain of clusters .",
    "in fact , this structure is similar to the square - triangle frank - kasper phases usually used in the quasi - crystals.@xcite    the _ ih _ clusters appear following the _ pt - d _ clusters at larger sizes . some selected _ ih _ clusters are listed in the fig.6 . each cluster is given in the side view and the top view .",
    "there are many discussions in previous papers about _ ih_.@xcite the _ ih _ clusters can be viewed as packing atoms based on a 13-atom pentadechedron but not a 13-atom icosahedron .",
    "usually , comparing with _",
    "pt _ , _ ih _ clusters have larger fcc(111 ) surface and shell - like structure .",
    "these _ ih _ clusters are stable due to their extreme large fcc(111 ) surface and less strains comparing to _",
    "pt_. for any _ ih _ based cluster , it can always form a closed - shell icosahedron by packing enough atoms on it .",
    "there are also a few _ ih _ clusters(see",
    "fig.7 ) , which are interesting because they are not the fracture of next closed - shell icosaheron , but the fracture of the larger icosahedron . for example , _ ih _ clusters of n=48,50 are not the fracture of n=55 icosahedron , but the fracture of n=147 icosahedron . also clusters with n=89,90(@xmath15 ) and n=62,65(@xmath16 ) are the fracture of n=561 icosaheron .",
    "these clusters were discussed by baletto _ _ et al__@xcite as natural pathway to the growth of larger _",
    "ih _ clusters .",
    "fig.8 shows some _ dh _ , _ cp _ and _ dis _ structures . both _",
    "cp _ clusters are found for the small value of @xmath8 . for simple pair potentials , the smaller _ dh _ and",
    "_ cp _ can only exist for very narrow potential , or potential with very large @xmath2 , such as @xmath3 clusters .",
    "_ cp _ definitely have the same structure with fcc crystal , and _ dh _ is also more close to fcc structure over _ pt _ and _",
    "ih_. disorder clusters appear for larger @xmath8 around 1.2 , where the potential is much flat around the bottom .",
    "some disordered clusters are in fact a serious distorted ordered structures . for example , distorted _",
    "ih_(n=85,103,@xmath8=1.2 ) are listed .",
    "there are many disordered structures are hard to be recognized based on any ordered structures(n=38,@xmath8=1.2 ) .",
    "there are also some interpenetrated clusters , which exhibit the combination of two type structures.@xcite the interpenetrated clusters were found during the structure motif changing .",
    "the remarkable feature of these clusters is that it exhibits different structural character by looking from different direction , for examples , the cluster of n=59 and @xmath17 is found between _ pt _ and _ ih_.    fig.9 plots the zero temperature structure phase diagram as a function of both cluster size and @xmath8 .",
    "it can be seen that , the smaller @xmath8 , the more _ dh _ and _",
    "cp _ clusters , and the less disorder clusters . for @xmath8=0.8 , the structure is dominated by the _ dh _ and _ cp_. and only one _ dh _ and one _ cp _ clusters are found in the potentials of @xmath18 .",
    "the number of _ pt _ clusters increase with increasing of @xmath8 . for different potentials ,",
    "this growth sequence stops at the different sizes(n=24(@xmath8=0.8),n=31(@xmath8=0.9 ) , n=34(@xmath8=0.95),n=37(@xmath8=1.0,1.05,1.1),n=43(@xmath8=1.2 ) ) .",
    "_ pt - d _ clusters favor the size within 25 to 107 .",
    "after the _ pt - d _ motif first emerges at @xmath8=0.95 , its number increases with the increasing of @xmath8 , and reaches the maximum around @xmath8=1.05 . as @xmath8 continues to increase , the distribution of",
    "_ pt - d _ motif begins to reduce . at @xmath8=1.2 , only seven _",
    "pt - d _ clusters are found .",
    "the disordered clusters first emerge at the large size between the two magic number n=55 and n=147 at @xmath8=1.0 , and its distribution increase as the increasing of @xmath8 . at the value of @xmath8=1.2",
    ", it is dominated by the disordered cluster .",
    "ih_-based clusters usually appear in larger sizes .",
    "_ ih _ clusters dominate for value of @xmath8=0.9 and 0.95 , and its number decreases for both @xmath8 larger than 0.95 and smaller 0.9 .    since clusters have non - neglectful surface effect and large deformation in contract with its bulk crystal , the competition between the deformation(strain ) and surface energy plays the key role in determining cluster structures .",
    "according to this consideration , we can give a qualitative explanation for the existing of each structural type .",
    "small size clusters have very large surface - volume ratio , thus the surface effect is dominated . _",
    "pt _ clusters are abundant at small sizes due to its the lowest energy surface , fcc(111 ) surface .",
    "the dominant geometric effect can not be easily affected unless for enough strong atomic interaction . for morse",
    "potential,@xcite only an extreme narrow potential can breaks the _ pt _ motif .",
    "since strains in _ pt _ clusters increase rapidly due to continuously packing tetrahedra , _ pt - d _ replace the _ pt _ with size increasing due to the partially release of strains . further increasing sizes , both _ pt _ and _ pt - d _ are more and more unfavorable , thus the _ ih _ clusters appear .",
    "_ ih _ clusters have the similar surface as _ pt _ and _ pt - d _ , but the inner strain is much reduced when taking _ ih _ arrangement .",
    "this is the reason why the _ ih _ clusters appear after _ pt - d _ ones .    among _ ih",
    "_ , _ dh _ and _ cp _ structure , _ ih _ has the lowest surface energy and largest deformation energy , _ cp _ is opposite , while _ dh _ is in the middle . for small @xmath8(narrow potential ) , the structure with large deformation(strain ) is unfavorable , _ cp _ and _ dh _ are dominated .",
    "the deformation(strain ) can be neglected for largest @xmath8(more flat potential ) , the _ pt _ and disordered clusters are favorable . for middle value of @xmath8 , the _ pt - d _ and _",
    "ih _ are appeared .",
    "generally _ dis _ should have the largest strain energy , thus it can only survive for flat potential , this is the case of large @xmath8 in present case .",
    "the cluster distribution is in agreement with the doye s qualitative principle that decreasing the range of the pair - potential(the width of potential well ) has the effect of destabilizing strained structures .",
    "it needs to point that a quantitative analysis is necessary for detailed understanding .",
    "the most stable structure of bulk phase is bcc for @xmath19 , however only one cluster has the character as a fraction of bcc , which is the one with n=8 and @xmath8=1.2 . on the contrary , a large number of _ ih _ and _ pt _ clusters are found for @xmath19 .",
    "the main reasons come from the surface effect of small cluster , which result in the clusters adopting the most close packed fcc(111 ) surface",
    ". however , there could be the inherent competition between fcc and bcc , the existence of _ dis _ and _ pt - d _ clusters could be the results for @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how the change of equilibrium pair separation ( or atomic size ) for a fixed interaction range affects the favored structures of atomic clusters .",
    "to do so , a simple pair potential , which equilibrium pair separation can be varied under a fixed interaction range by changing one of the potential parameters has been proposed .",
    "this potential also can make both face - centered - cubic structure and body - centered - cubic stable by changing the parameter .",
    "the evolution of cluster structures are calculated for several sets of parameters .",
    "our results show that , the potential with large equilibrium pair separation(larger atomic size ) favors _ dh _ and _ cp _ structures , disordered clusters appear for the potential with small equilibrium pair separation , while for the middle range of equilibrium pair separation , the _ ih _ structures are dominated .",
    "present observation conforms the doye and walse s qualitative principle that decreasing the range of the pair - potential has the effect of destabilizing strained structures .",
