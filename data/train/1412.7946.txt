    "in this paper we present a multiscale approach for heterojunction interfaces in semiconductors , part of a larger interdisciplinary effort between computational mathematicians , physicists , and material scientists interested in building more efficient solar cells .",
    "the higher efficiency ( may ) arise from putting together different semiconductor materials , i.e. , creating a _ heterojunction_.    the computational challenge is that phenomena at heterojunctions must be resolved at the angstrom scale while the size of the device is on the scale of microns , thus it is difficult to simultaneously account for correct physics and keep the model computationally tractable . to model charge transport at the device scale we use the drift diffusion ( d - d ) system @xcite . for interfaces ,",
    "we follow the approach from @xcite in which the interface region is shrunk to a low - dimensional internal boundary , and physics at this interface is approximated by the thermionic emission model ( tem ) which consists of unusual internal boundary conditions with jumps .",
    "we determine the data for these jumps from an angstrom scale calculation using density functional theory ( dft ) , and we model the physics away from the interface by the usual ( d - d ) equations coupled by tem",
    ". the d - d model can be hard - coded as a monolithic approach which appears intractable and/or impractical in 2d/3d with complicated interface geometries .",
    "our proposed alternative is to apply a domain decomposition ( ddm ) approach which allows the use of `` black box '' d - d solvers in subdomains , and enforces the tem conditions at the level of the ddm driver .",
    "ddm have been applied to d - d , e.g. , in @xcite , where the focus was on a multicore hpc implementation of efficiently implemented suite of linear and nonlinear solvers . here",
    "we align the ddm with handling microscale physics at material interfaces .",
    "more importantly , fully decoupling the subdomains is a first step towards a true multiscale simulation where the behavior in the heterojunction region is treated simultaneously by a computational method at microscale .    the ddm approach we propose is non - standard because of the nonhomogeneous jumps arising from tem . in @xcite",
    "we presented the * ddp * algorithm for the potential equation . in this paper",
    "we report on the next nontrivial step which involves carrier transport equations . here",
    "the interface model is an unusual robin - like interface equation .",

    "we describe the model . in section  [ sec : ddalgs ] we present our domain decomposition algorithms , and in section  [ sec : scsim ] we present numerical results for the simulation of two semiconductor heterojunctions . finally in section  [ sec : conc ] we present conclusions , hpc context , and describe future work .",
