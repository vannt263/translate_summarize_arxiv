    "new members of this class found in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey by moran , halpern , & helfand ( 1996 ) all have emission to some degree .",
    "the latter paper further argues the need for a nls1 class .",
    "it has long been known that there are high - luminosity analogs of this class , the prototype of which is i  zw  1 ( e.g. , phillips 1976 ) , which also have weak forbidden lines , narrow permitted lines , and strong .",
    "one of the most extreme narrow - line qsos is phl  1092 ( bergeron & kunth 1980 , 1984 ; kwan et al .",
    "its  @xmath44570/h@xmath5 ratio is 5.3 , and its line widths are only @xmath6  km  s@xmath1 ( bergeron & kunth 1984 )",

    "einstein _ ( wilkes et al .",
    "1994 ) . supported by the results of a _ rosat _ observation of phl  1092 , we argue that the nls1s and their qso analogs can be understood as a single phenomenon , the `` i  zw  1 '' objects .",
    "in addition to sharing their extreme x - ray behavior , phl  1092 might illuminate fundamental puzzles about this distinctive class .",
    "an archival _ rosat _ pspc observation of phl  1092 was reduced in the standard way using the pros version 2.3 x - ray analysis package and xspec for spectral fitting .",
    "a summary of the observation is presented in table 1 . only counts in pulse invariant ( pi ) channels 0.112.01",
    "kev were used .",
    "a power law fitted the spectrum very well , with photon index @xmath7 ( 90% confidence ) , luminosity @xmath8 ( 5.4 @xmath9 ) @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 and @xmath11 consistent with the galactic 21 cm value ( murphy et al .",
    "although this spectrum is very steep , it is not unusual for the nls1 class ( boller et al . 1996 ;",
    "forster 1996 ) .",

    "other simple models , such as blackbody or thermal bremsstrahlung , significantly underpredicted the galactic @xmath11 .",
    "blackbody plus power - law and bremsstrahlung plus power - law models did not improve on the single power - law fit , and more complicated models were not justified by the results of an @xmath13 test .",
    "the rapid x - ray variability of phl  1092 during the @xmath14 observation rules out the possibility of a thermal bremsstrahlung component providing the bulk of the x - ray luminosity ( see  3.2 ) .",

    "there was a highly significant increase in flux by a factor of 4 sometime during the intial two - day period , followed by a decrease of about 20% in 6000  s , albeit at a lower level of significance .",
    "small changes in the hardness ratio possibly occurred as well .",
    "because the luminosity is so large , @xmath42  ergs  s@xmath1 , these x - ray variations stretch the limits that can be achieved by an isotropic source powered by accretion onto a non - rotating black hole as expressed by the relation @xmath43 ( fabian 1979 ; fabian & rees 1979 ) , where @xmath44 is the time scale and @xmath45 the amplitude of variability .",
    "the required radiative efficiency @xmath46 would be @xmath47 for the initial ( unresolved ) increase by a factor of 4 , and possibly as high as 0.61 if the subsequent variation in 6000  s is real .",
    "values of @xmath46 larger than 0.057 , the limit for an accretion disk in the schwarzschild metric , require either accretion onto a kerr black hole , or modification of the assumptions implicit in the fabian - rees relation , for example invoking anisotropic emission .",
    "the addition of a blackbody of temperature @xmath48  ev to the power - law model , although not justified statistically by an @xmath13 test , reduces the x - ray luminosity to @xmath49  ergs  s@xmath1 , but this still requires the radiative efficiency to exceed 0.062 for the initial increase .",
    "the blackbody plus power - law model is very poorly constrained . the 90% confidence limit on the parameters of the single power - law model indicate a similar lower limit to the x - ray luminosity , @xmath50  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "in addition to its rapid variability , phl  1092 was a much brighter _ rosat _ x - ray source than would have been expected from the weak _ einstein _ ipc detection in july  1979 . in a 6389 s ipc observation ,",
    "only @xmath51 counts were collected , corresponding to a probable @xmath52  kev luminosity of @xmath53  ergs  s@xmath1 ( wilkes et al .",
    "although part of the factor of @xmath54 discrepancy between the _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ peak luminosities is undoubtedly due to the extremely steep spectral index of phl  1092 and the different bandpasses of the two instruments , the _ einstein _ count rate is still a factor of 21 smaller than would be predicted by folding the _ rosat _ fitted spectrum through the ipc response ( using pimms , see table 2 ) .",
    "long - term x - ray variability by more than a factor of 10 is rare among agns , and the most dramatic examples seem to be members of the i  zw  1 class .",
    "table 2 is a compilation of such reports from the recent literature , involving intercomparisons among _ heao 1 _ , _ einstein _ , _ exosat _ , and _ rosat_. all but e1615 + 061 satisfy the i  zw  1 definition .",
    "we have also added the narrow - line qso pg  1404 + 226 ( fwhm h@xmath5 = 880  km  s@xmath1 , /h@xmath5 = 1.01 , boroson & green 1992 ) based on the _ rosat _ data of ulrich & molendi ( 1996 ) , which indicates a brightening by a factor of 13 from the _ einstein _ flux ( assuming the pspc photon index of 3.57 applies to both observations ) .",

    "a decrease in the h@xmath73 luminosity of ic  3599 by a factor of 10 in less than a year ( mannheim et al .",

    "the observed x - ray variability in phl  1092 is not the most rapid seen among agns but it is unusual in an object of such high x - ray luminosity .",
    "this has implications for the assumptions usually made about the accretion process and the generation of x - rays from the inner regions of an accretion disk .",
    "the fabian - rees relation assumes that the flux released from conversion of mass to energy is isotropically emitted from a spherically symmetric , homogeneous region where no bulk relativistic motions occur , while the upper limit of 0.057 for the efficiency applies to the particular case of a thin accretion disk around a non - rotating black hole . in phl  1092 and similar objects , it is likely that either the radiation is emitted anisotropically , or the accretion disk extends to smaller radius as a result of rotation of the black hole .",
    "blazars also show rapid variability and high x - ray luminosity , and many models of their broad - band energy distribution invoke bulk relativistic motion of the emitting plasma .",
    "it is much less compelling to apply such a model to i  zw  1 objects , as their similarity to blazars does nt extend much past their x - ray variability .",
    "i  zw  1s are generally radio quiet , are weakly polarized in the optical ( goodrich 1989 ) , and have strong optical emission lines .",
    "the rapid response of the balmer lines to the ionizing continuum in ic  3599 ( mannheim et al .",
    "1996 ) indicates that dense emission - line clouds can indeed exist close to the nucleus in these objects , and argues against the hypothesis that a steep x - ray spectrum destroys the emission - line clouds through the lack of a two - phase photoionization equilibrium ( guilbert , fabian , & mccray 1983 ) .",
    "while analyzing the _ rosat _ spectra of a large sample of optically selected i  zw  1 objects , we discovered a significant ( @xmath86 99% probability ) correlation between their intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity and their x - ray spectral slope .",
    "this correlation is presented in figure  3 ; the data are discussed in detail by forster ( 1996 ) .",
    "the correlation exists across four orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity and is highly significant even if phl  1092 is excluded from the sample .",
    "the position of phl  1092 in this diagram argues for it to be regarded as a high - luminosity but otherwise typical member of the i  zw  1 class .",
    "the rather shallow dependence of the photon index over many orders of magnitude in luminosity argues for a weak dependence of spectral shape on some fundamental parameter , possibly the mass of the black hole .",
    "another interesting question involves the relationship between the objects discussed here and the elusive `` type 2 qsos '' ( high - luminosity counterparts of seyfert  2 galaxies ) .",
    "independent of any orientation - dependent unification schemes , their small [ ] /h@xmath5 ratios ,    rapid x - ray variability , and lack of x - ray obscuration disqualify the i  zw  1 objects as luminous seyfert 2s .",
    "neither does it seem likely that they are the `` pole - on '' parent population of seyfert  2 galaxies in unification models , because the majority of hidden seyfert  1 galaxies revealed in polarized light do not have strong permitted lines ( tran 1995 ) , while emission is a hallmark of the i  zw  1 class .",
    "it remains , then , to ask if there are _ any _ high - luminosity counterparts of seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "limiting the discussion to x - ray sources , we are aware of only four such candidates .",
    "the oft - mentioned _ einstein _ source 1e  0449184 ( @xmath87 , stocke et al .",
    "1982 ) is not a secure example because its classification is based solely on the absence of broad h@xmath5 .",
    "its h@xmath73 line has never been examined , and its line does appear to be broad ( stocke et al .",
    "a more recent candidate , iras  201812244 ( @xmath88 , elizalde & steiner 1994 ) , selected from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , was subsequently shown with better spectroscopy to be a i  zw  1 object ( moran et al .",
    "1996 ) , and not even the most luminous one among 20 similar objects in that survey .",
    "the latest candidates are the _ rosat _ source rx j13434 + 0001 at @xmath89 ( almaini et al .",
    "1995 ) , and an @xmath90 source at @xmath91 ( ax  j08494 + 4454 , ohta et al .",
    "1996 ) , but their faintness and high redshift do not yet allow evaluation in comparable detail to that of the better studied low - redshift objects . a fifth candidate , the hyperluminous _ iras _ galaxy p09104 + 4109 ( @xmath92 ) , was at first thought to be the most luminous hidden agn in x - rays based on its spectrum from @xmath90 ( fabian et al .",
    "however , a subsequent @xmath14 hri image showed that the bulk of the x - ray emission is extended , and probably all originates in a massive cooling flow ( fabian & crawford 1995 ) .",
    "so while there are many ultraluminous _ iras _ galaxies with optical spectra like seyfert 2 galaxies , there is little , if any , evidence that they are luminous x - ray sources . in any case",
    ", it appears that qsos of the i  zw  1 class must be more numerous than any `` type 2 qsos . ''    finally , one of the oldest unsolved mysteries in the study of agns is the `` problem '' .",
    "photoionization models can not account for the /h@xmath5 ratio in those objects in which it is largest .",
    "consequently , mechanical sources of heating have been postulated .",
    "kwan et al . ( 1995 ) recently proposed a scenario for phl  1092 in which ( and ) emission is produced in an accretion disk at low temperature by the dissipation of orbital energy as the material is forced to corotate with magnetic field lines tied to a kerr black hole . quite independently , we find evidence from the x - ray variability of phl  1092 and similar objects that a kerr black hole may be needed to account for their high efficiency .",
    "for this proposed link to be consistent , however , the emitting region in the outer disk must be largely shielded from view of the luminous photoionizing source at the nucleus .",
    "we analyzed the _ rosat _",
    "pspc observation of the luminous qso phl  1092 , and conclude that it deserves to be classified as a luminous narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy for the following reasons :        \\3 ) the large amplitude variability of its x - ray emission over long time scales is similar to that of wpvs 007 ( grupe et al .",
    "1995b ) and pg 1404 + 226 , both of which are nls1s with ultra - soft x - ray spectra and strong emission .",
    "we also found a correlation between x - ray spectral index and x - ray luminosity which may eventually help to constrain models of accretion in i  zw  1 objects .",
    "the possibility that rotating black holes may be implicated in the explanation of both the unusual x - ray and optical properties of this class is suggested .",
