    "the concept of _ duality _ in mathematics is incredibly rich and powerful , occurring in many places .",
    "even so , it is not easy to define in general terms .",
    "however the essential properties entail that the dual of the dual is the starting object and that an object can be self - dual .    in this article , we will say that a pair of rectangles , with sides @xmath0 and @xmath1 are called _ dual _ if the area of each is the perimeter of the other .",
    "we will assume throughout that the rectangles are lying down : in other words , that the pairs are written with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "[ seven]there are precisely seven pairs of dual rectangles with integral sides .",
    "two are self - dual : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the remaining five are @xmath6    the duality property translates into the following pair of simultaneous equations : @xmath7 there are infinitely many rational solutions to the equations in ( [ basic ] ) as we now show .",
    "once @xmath8 and @xmath9 are fixed there remain two simultaneous equations in the two variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out these have a unique solution provided @xmath12 . in this case @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given explicitly by @xmath13 thus any pair of rational values for @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath14 yields a pair of rational numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 by solving the simultaneous equations .",
    "( * exercise : * what happens when @xmath15 ? )",
    "what is more , provided @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive and @xmath16 , the solutions are guaranteed to consist of positive rational numbers .",
    "it follows that there exist infinitely many pairs of dual rectangles with rational sides .",
    "theorem  [ seven ] asserts that only finitely many of these pairs have integral sides .",
    "eliminating @xmath9 from the equations in ( [ basic ] ) shows that @xmath11 satisfies a quadratic equation @xmath17 solving this equation shows that @xmath18 therefore , a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for @xmath11 to be integral is @xmath19 for some non - negative integer @xmath20 .",
    "re - arranging ( [ quartic ] ) and factorizing yields @xmath21 since @xmath22 divides @xmath23 , it follows that @xmath24 the hypothesis that @xmath25 implies that the right hand side of ( [ inequality ] ) is bounded above by @xmath26 . since @xmath27",
    ", the left hand side of ( [ inequality ] ) is bounded below by @xmath28 . therefore @xmath29 and cancelling @xmath10 shows that @xmath30 . by an entirely symmetrical argument , @xmath31 also .",
    "hence there are a finite number of integer pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "each one yields at most one integer pair @xmath10 and @xmath11 using the same method as before . for each value of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath32 and @xmath14 , the corresponding values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in ( [ canda ] ) can be checked for integrality , using a computer ( we did ) .",
    "the cases when @xmath15 do not lead to consistent equations .",
    "* exercise : * using the formul in ( [ canda ] ) turns up quite a few examples of pairs of dual rectangles where three out of the four sides are integers .",
    "for example : @xmath33 adapt the method of proof above to show there only finitely many pairs of dual rectangles with three integral sides , and list them all .",
    "a rational self - dual rectangle corresponds to a solution of the equation @xmath34 in positive rational numbers .",
    "the equation ( [ selfdual ] ) describes a rectangular hyperbola .",
    "suppose we are given two distinct rational points on the hyperbola @xmath35 consider the triangle @xmath36 .",
    "the orthocentre of the triangle has rational coefficients .",
    "explicitly , @xmath37 and this point lies on the hyperbola too ( see @xcite ) as the following diagram illustrates .        now define @xmath38 as the reflection of the orthocentre of the triangle @xmath36 in the line @xmath39 .",
    "plainly the point so defined has rational coordinates : @xmath40 our remarks confirm that the map defined by ( [ orthogroupop ] ) is closed : thus it is a binary operation .",
    "what is more , we can take ( [ orthogroupop ] ) to define the map even when  @xmath41 .",
    "in other words , we can also ` double ' points .",
    "[ group ] the operation defined by ( [ orthogroupop ] ) is commutative and associative having the point @xmath4 as the identity .",
    "thus the set of rational self - dual rectangles forms an abelian group .",
    "* exercise : * prove theorem [ group ] .",
    "in this section , we show how the theory of diophantine equations ( polynomial equations with integer coefficients ) can be used to construct new solutions to ( [ basic ] ) from known solutions .",
    "our motivation comes from a recent successful attack , by gerry tunnell , upon a classical problem about triangles with rational sides having an integral area ( see koblitz excellent book  @xcite ) .    the right - angled triangle with sides @xmath42 has area equal to  @xmath43 . the triangle with sides @xmath44 is also right - angled and has area equal to  @xmath43 . in a sense which can be made precise",
    ", it is the next simplest such triangle . in (",
    "* section 5.2 ) we used tunnell s ideas to point out that there are in fact infinitely many right - angled triangles with rational sides having area equal to  @xmath43 .",
    "the technique uses the theory of certain cubic curves called _ elliptic curves _ ( the book @xcite is an excellent reference for background reading ) . the way it turns out",
    ", a geometric binary operation can be defined on the curve @xmath45 which allows known rational solutions to be used to construct other rational solutions . a dialogue between this curve and triangles",
    "then allows other triangles to be constructed .",
    "one of the fascinating aspects of elliptic curves is the way that combining quite simple solutions can yield very complicated solutions .",
    "we will model this idea now using the equation in ( [ quadratic ] ) and show that a similar phenomenon is at work .",
    "this equation defines a cubic surface in @xmath46-space so straight lines should meet it in @xmath46 points .",
    "define an operation as follows .",
    "given two rational points on ( [ quadratic ] ) , join them by a straight line .",
    "the third point of intersection will have rational coordinates .",
    "thus a new solution of ( [ quadratic ] ) will be constructed .",
    "hopefully this will yield a new pair of rational dual rectangles .",
    "\\1 . from the list of pairs of integral dual rectangles in theorem  [ seven ] ,",
    "select the rectangle @xmath47 which yields the point @xmath48 on ( [ quadratic ] ) , as well as the rectangle @xmath49 which yields the point @xmath50 on ( [ quadratic ] ) . the straight line joining these points has equation @xmath51 as @xmath52 runs over the real numbers .",
    "substitute into the equation ( [ quadratic ] ) and a cubic equation for @xmath52 emerges @xmath53 the @xmath46 roots of the equation ( [ theta ] ) are @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the first two correspond to the points we know about .",
    "the last one yields the point @xmath56 and this gives rise to the following pair of dual rectangles with rational sides @xmath57 notice the way that combining two integral points produced quite a complicated rational point .",
    "this resonates strongly with the theory of elliptic curves .",
    "the next example gives another illustration of the phenomenon .",
    "\\2 . using the rectangles @xmath58 and @xmath59 yields the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 on ( [ quadratic ] ) .",
    "the straight line joining these points has equation @xmath62 substituting into the equation ( [ quadratic ] ) yields the following cubic equation for @xmath52 : @xmath63 the @xmath46 roots of the equation ( [ theta2 ] ) are @xmath54 and @xmath64 .",
    "the last one yields the point @xmath65 and this gives rise to the following pair of dual rectangles with rational sides @xmath66    * warning : * this method is not guaranteed to work in a straightforward manner .",
    "the geometry of the cubic surface ( [ quadratic ] ) means that the third point of intersection will not necessarily produce a pair of dual rectangles . if the third point of intersection exists and has a positive value of  @xmath11 then the corresponding value of  @xmath9 exists and is positive - hence a pair of dual rectangles are created .",
    "however a negative or even a zero  @xmath11 value could emerge . in this case the equations make sense but will not allow an interpretation in terms of dual rectangles .",
    "* non - example : * suppose we try to ` add ' the two points @xmath48 and @xmath60 which come from theorem  [ seven ]",
    ". the straight line joining these points has equation @xmath67 as @xmath52 runs over the real numbers .",
    "substitute into the equation ( [ quadratic ] ) and a cubic equation for @xmath52 emerges with roots @xmath68 .",
    "the third root yields the point @xmath69 and hence a value for @xmath70 .",
    "these values satisfy the equations in ( [ basic ] ) but they plainly do not produce a pair of dual rectangles ."
