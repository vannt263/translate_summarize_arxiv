    "the first auther @xcite studied the reidemister torsion of seifert fibered homology lens spaces , and showed the following :    [ th : seifert ] ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the only surgeries on @xmath0 that may produce a seifert fibered space with base @xmath8 and with @xmath9 have coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath10 , and produce seifert fibered space with three singular fibers .",

    "it is conjectured that seifert surgeries on non - trivial knots are integral ( except some cases ) .",
    "we @xcite have studied the @xmath4-seifert surgery , one of the remaining cases of the above theorem , by applying the reidemister torsion and the casson - walker - lescop invariant , and have given sufficient conditions to determine the integrality of @xmath4 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we note two differences of this paper from @xcite ; one is that the surgery coefficient appears in the condition instead of the casson - walker - lescop invariant , and another is that we need more delicate estimation for the dedekind sum to prove the result .",
