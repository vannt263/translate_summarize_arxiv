    "the goal of using entangled electron pairs for the processing of quantum information poses a technological challenge that requires novel ideas on electron quantum transport .",
    "it has been proposed that a conventional superconductor is a natural source of entangled electrons which may be emitted into a normal metal through a properly designed interface @xcite . at low temperatures and voltages ,",
    "the electric current through a normal - superconducting ( ns ) interface is made exclusively of electron cooper pairs whose internal singlet correlation may survive for some time in the context of the normal metal .",
    "the emission of two correlated electrons from a superconductor into a normal metal is often described as the andreev reflection @xcite of an incident hole which is converted into an outgoing electron .",
    "the equivalence between the two pictures has been rigorously proved in refs . .",
    "there the relation was established between the various quasiparticle scattering channels as these are referred to different choices of normal metal chemical potential , i.e. to different definitions of the vacuum . when the reference chemical potential employed to label quasiparticle states in the normal metal is identical to the superconductor chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) , the number of bogoliubov quasiparticles is conserved and the andreev picture holds .",
    "if , on the contrary , @xmath1 is chosen to be smaller than @xmath2 , quasiparticle number conservation is not guaranteed and spontaneous emission of two electrons through the sn interface becomes possible @xcite .",
    "transport calculations across an sn interface at low temperature and voltage which invoke an explicit two - electron picture have been presented in refs . .",
    "the need for spatial separation of the entangled beams has motivated the search for schemes that constrain ( or at least allow ) the two pair electrons to be emitted from different locations at the ns interface @xcite . in the conventional picture",
    "where quasiparticle scattering is unitary , that process is viewed as the absorption of a hole and its subsequent reemission as an electron from a distant point .",
    "such a crossed ( or nonlocal ) andreev reflection has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the requirement of physical separation is a severe limitation in practice , since pairing correlations decay with distance . as a consequence",
    ", the current intensity of nonlocally entangled electrons decreases with the distance @xmath3 between the two emitting points .",
    "there is an exponential decay on the scale of the superconductor coherence length which reflects the short - range character of the superconductor pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "a more important limitation in practice comes from the prefactor , which , besides oscillating on the scale of the superconductor fermi wavelength , decreases algebraically with distance . in the tunneling limit , and for a ballistic 3d superconductor , the decay law is @xmath4 , if the tunneling matrix elements are assumed to be momentum independent @xcite , or @xmath5 , if proper account is taken of the low - momentum hopping dependence @xcite . within the context of momentum - independent tunneling models , the power law changes if the superconductor is low ( @xmath6 ) dimensional @xcite , or diffusive @xcite , yielding @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "it remains to be investigated how that behavior changes when more realistic tunnel matrix elements are employed @xcite and when geometries other than planar or straight boundaries are considered .",
    "in this article we propose an experimental setup that would guarantee long term separation of correlated electron pairs without the shortcomings caused by the need to emit the pair electrons from distant points .",
    "the idea is _ to transmit both electrons through the same spatial region but inducing them to leave in different directions_. in a ballistic normal metal such as a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , that divergent propagation guarantees the long term separation of the entangled electrons at distances from the source much greater than the size of the source .    to force the pair electrons to leave in different directions , we propose to exploit the formation of resonances in a properly designed normal - superconductor interface",
    ". these could be one - electron ( normal ) resonances , such as those found in double - barrier structures @xcite ( sinin structure ) , or two - electron ( andreev ) resonances such as the de gennes ",
    "saint - james resonances appearing in structures with one barrier located on the normal metal side at some distance from the transmissive sn interface ( snin structure ) @xcite .",
    "those quasi - bound states have it in common that , in a perfect interface , they select the perpendicular energy of the exiting electrons while ensuring the conservation of the momentum parallel to the interface . at low voltages and temperatures , this also determines the parallel energy , given that the total energy of the current contributing electrons is constrained to lie close to the normal fermi level .",
    "altogether , this mechanism fixes the magnitude of the exit angle , since the parallel momenta of the pair electrons are opposite to each other and both remain unchanged during transmission through the perfect interface .",
    "thus the electron velocities form a v - shaped beam centered around the perpendicular axis .",
    "the type of structures which are needed seems to be within the reach of current experimental expertise . in the last fifteen years",
    ", several groups have built a variety of hybrid superconductor - semiconductor ( ssm ) structures @xcite .",
    "more recently , some experimental groups @xcite have investigated transport through ssm structures where sm is a 2deg on a plane essentially perpendicular to the superconductor boundary . in such setups ,",
    "the sn interface lies at the one - dimensional ( 1d ) border of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ballistic metal . if two parallel straight - line barriers were drawn in that structure , one along the sn interface and another one at some distance within n , then the experimental scenario considered in this article would be reproduced .  a three - dimensional ( 3d ) version of the same structure , in which sm would be 3d and the interface would be 2d , of the type reported in ref .",
    ", would also produce divergent electron beams .",
    "these , however , would be emitted into a 3d semiconductor , where it may be more difficult to pattern suitable detectors .",
    "once the two electrons propagate in the ballistic 2deg , their motion can be controlled by means of existing techniques .",
    "for instance , they can be made to pass through properly located narrow apertures , such as those used in electron focusing experiments @xcite . for quantum information processing , their spin component in an arbitrary direction could eventually be measured by using the rashba effect @xcite to rotate the spin before electrons enter the spin filter @xcite",
    ". then one could attempt to measure bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may measure electric current cross - correlations @xcite to indirectly detect the presence of singlet spin correlations .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the model we have adopted for our calculations .",

    "it was shown in ref . that the picture of two - electron emission and hole andreev reflection are equivalent .",
    "for computational purposes , we employ here the standard andreev picture whereby all quasiparticles have positive energy ( @xmath31 ) , with the quasiparticle energy origin given by @xmath2 .",

    "an important feature is that the absence of a hole at @xmath31 in the andreev scenario corresponds to the presence of an electron at @xmath32 in the two - electron picture @xcite .    in a transport context , the superconductor and normal metal chemical potentials differ by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the applied bias voltage . in the andreev picture ,",
    "one artificially takes @xmath2 as the reference chemical potential for labeling quasiparticles and the imbalance @xmath35 is accounted for by introducing an extra population of incoming holes with energies between 0 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "an apparent shortcoming of the andreev picture is that it does not show explicitly that the emitted electron pairs are internally entangled . in this respect",
    ", we may note the following remarks :  ( i ) the two - electron hopping matrix element vanishes when the spin state in the n side is a triplet @xcite ;  ( ii ) an analytical study of transport through a broad sn interface based on a two - electron tunneling picture @xcite ( with the final state explicitly entangled ) gives results identical to those obtained within an andreev description @xcite ;  ( iii ) entanglement in the outgoing electron pairs has been explicitly proven in the general tunneling case @xcite ; and ( iv ) transport across the sn structure is spin independent and thus must preserve the internal spin correlations of the emitted electron pair @xcite .",

    "in what follows , we focus on the behavior for @xmath187 .",
    "both in figs . 8a and 8b we present two groups of curves , corresponding to a small and a large gap . the barrier parameters of fig .",
    "8a are the same as those of figs . 5 and 6 , namely , @xmath62 .",
    "although figs . 5 and 6 already exhibit andreev features such as the double - peaked lobes in @xmath179 , these are washed out when the angular variable is integrated to yield the total spectral conductance @xmath198 , as shown by the single peaked curves obtained for the same value of the gap as in fig . 5 ( @xmath199 mev ) , or by the absence of peaks for the parameters of fig . 6 ( @xmath183 mev@xmath200 .",
    "the curves for @xmath199 mev display a clear zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) whose height is determined by the structure normal properties [ see eq . ( [ been ] ) ] .",
    "as @xmath125 increases above zero , both electron and holes ( or both the upper and lower energy emitted electrons ) may benefit from the low - lying normal resonance ( @xmath201 ) as long as @xmath202 , where @xmath85 is the linewidth of the normal resonance .",
    "when @xmath203 , it is not possible to channel both electrons through the same resonance and the contribution to the conductances decreases . on closer inspection , one finds that the width of the zbcp is indeed determined by the normal resonance width , but not by that appearing in the perpendicular transmission @xmath127 ( viewed as a function of @xmath125 ) .",
    "rather , it essentially mirrors the width of the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ reduced - g ] ) .",
    "this is the product @xmath204 evaluated at @xmath99 and viewed also as a function of @xmath125 , i.e. for electrons leaving in the direction of maximum current flow ( at exit angle @xmath205 ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the result stating that , when @xmath11 is replaced by a disordered normal metal , the width of the zbcp is of the order of the thouless energy @xcite .",
    "a general property of sn interfaces with a single barrier right at the interface is that andreev reflection probability tends to unity as @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "however , we find that this is generally not the case for a double barrier interface .",
    "for @xmath110 , we do notice that sharp peaks in @xmath174 form just below the gap for some values of @xmath22 , so close to it that they can be observed only through a magnification of fig .",
    "due to this tendency to acquire large values near the gap , @xmath174 goes through a minimum at finite @xmath125 if the width of the zbcp is smaller than the gap .",
    "this is the case shown in fig .",
    "8a for @xmath199 mev . for a smaller gap ( @xmath183 mev ) ,",
    "the value of @xmath67 remains unchanged but there is no room for @xmath174 to display a minimum between 0 and @xmath20 .",
    "being @xmath110 more transmissive ( although not entirely , because of the reflection at the potential step ; see section iii ) , fig .",
    "8b displays andreev resonance features that do survive upon integration over angles . for @xmath199 mev and @xmath117 23 nm ,",
    "one observes a peak at finite energies that adds to the overall zbcp .",
    "as @xmath22 increases , the inner andreev peak evolves towards zero energy . at larger distances ( @xmath117 36 nm ) ,",
    "the lowest andreev resonance can only be hinted at as a shoulder in the plot for @xmath183 mev .",
    "we also note that , for @xmath117 24 and 26 nm , a second andreev resonance becomes visible close to the gap edge .  however , due to the involved interplay between the transmission probabilities and the cosine term appearing in eq .",
    "( [ reduced - g ] ) , this second peak does not appear to follow a simple monotonic trend .",
    "in fact , for @xmath199 mev , the second resonance is no longer observable because it evolves towards a sharp peak just below the gap .",
    "so far we have assumed that the sn interface is infinitely long ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this has allowed us to treat @xmath40 as a continuous , conserved quantum number , which considerably simplifies the transport calculation .",
    "of course , the idea of an infinite interface is at odds with the primary motivation of our work , which is to propose a method to spatially separate mutually entangled electron beams . below we argue that , fortunately , only a moderately long interface is needed in practice .    for simplicity ,",
    "we focus our discussion on the low voltage limit , where the total energy can be assumed to be sharply defined . then the width @xmath207 of the angular distribution is due only to the uncertainty in the parallel momentum @xmath208 .",
    "this in turn is closely connected to @xmath209 through the relation @xmath210 , since total energy uncertainty is zero .",
    "there are two contributions to the momentum uncertainty : the nonzero width of the resonance in the perpendicular transmission and the finite length of the sn interface .",
    "thus we may estimate@xmath211 this translates into an angular width@xmath212 the actual angular width of @xmath61 is actually a bit smaller , since the present estimate is based on one - electron considerations , while the relevant angular distribution is determined by eq .",
    "( [ been ] ) .",
    "we neglect this difference for the present simple estimates .",
    "( [ delta - th ] ) contains two contributions .",
    "the first term is determined by the normal resonance and is responsible for the width of the angular distributions plotted in figs . 2 - 4 ( with @xmath55 ) .",
    "our main concern here is that the second contribution , that which stems from the finiteness of the aperture , does not contribute significantly .    a strict criterion may be that the interface finite length should not modify the intrinsic angular width ( @xmath213 ) , which everywhere has been assumed to be small enough to allow for narrow divergent beams .",
    "a more lenient criterion is that , regardless of the specific value of @xmath85 , the finite aperture should not generate an excessively broad angular distribution . for typical cases",
    "this amounts to requiring @xmath214 ( for a discussion see fig . 5 in ref .",
    ") . for the bandwidth",
    "which we have assumed ( @xmath215 k ) and an effective mass of @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the bare electron mass , we have @xmath218 nm . so apertures greater than a few hundred nanometers seem desirable to keep the angular uncertainty within acceptable bounds .",
    "another source of angular spreading is interface roughness , with a characteristic length scale @xmath219 .",
    "however , it should not pose a fundamental problem as long as @xmath220 , so that a structure of intermediate width could be designed satisfying @xmath221 .    for the difference in velocity direction to translate into spatial separation ,",
    "it is necessary that the spin detectors are placed sufficiently away from the electron - emitting sn interface .",
    "of course , the needed distance depends also on the exit angle @xmath222 . for a convenient value of @xmath223",
    ", simple geometrical considerations suggest that , unsurprisingly , the distance @xmath6 from the detector to the center of the sn interface must be greater than its width @xmath224 .",
    "since elastic mean free paths in a 2deg can be made as high as @xmath225100 @xmath52 m , there seems to be potentially ample room for building structures satisfying @xmath226 .",
    "such devices would display well - defined divergent current lobes which could be detected ( and , eventually , manipulated ) at separate locations before the directional focusing is significantly reduced by elastic scattering .",
    "we have investigated theoretically the possibility of creating hybrid normal - superconductor structures where the two electrons previously forming a cooper pair in the superconductor are sent into different directions within the normal metal .",
    "the central idea relies on the design of a structure that is transparent only to electrons with perpendicular energy within a narrow range of a resonant level .",
    "since the total energy lies close to the fermi level , such a filtering of the electron perpendicular energy translates into _ exit angle selection_.    electrons from a conventional superconductor are known to be correlated in such a way that electrons moving at similar speeds in opposite directions tend to have opposite spin . at low temperatures and voltages , electron flow from the superconductor to the normal metal is entirely due the transmission of correlated electron pairs .",
    "these have both opposite spin and opposite parallel ( to the interface ) momentum , while possessing the same total energy .",
    "if the exit angle is selected by filtering the perpendicular momentum , the current in the normal metal is formed by two narrow , mutually singlet entangled electron beams which point in different directions and which spatially separate from each other at distances from the source much greater than the width of the source .",
    "the trick of exit angle selection is intended to facilitate a neat observation of nonlocal entanglement between electron beams , and this article has been devoted to proposing a specific implementation of that idea .",
    "one can not help noting , however , that such a selection of the outgoing direction might not be totally essential .",
    "if we content ourselves with measuring anticorrelated low - energy spin fluctuations over mesoscopic length scales , it may just be sufficient to place the two spin detectors symmetrically around the interface at a sufficient distance and angle , very much like in the setup of fig . 1a but with a conventional , non angle - selecting sn tunnel interface .",
    "if their motion between the emitter and the detector is ballistic , electrons arriving at each detector have , on average , opposite parallel momentum and opposite spin ( angular anticorrelation has been explicitly shown in ref . for a broad perfect interface ) .",
    "the boundaries of the 2deg might conceivably be designed to optimize such correlations .",
    "the outcome is that electrons arriving at each detector will exhibit a degree of nonlocal spin - singlet correlations that could be measured .",
    "altogether , we conclude that a ballistic two - dimensional electron gas provides an ideal scenario to probe nonlocal entanglement between electrons emitted from a distant , finite - size interface with a superconductor .",
    "if that interface is formed by a hybrid structure that selects the perpendicular energy and thus the magnitude of the electron exit angle , nonlocal spin correlations will be clearly observed if the outgoing beams are directed towards suitably placed detectors .",
