    "as part of the cleo - c analyses of exclusive  @xcite and inclusive semileptonic decays  @xcite , this article presents measurements of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 inclusive semileptonic branching fractions using the complete cleo - c data sets . using these results and known lifetimes",
    ", we also report the ratios of the widths @xmath16 ( which is expected to be unity due to isospin symmetry ) and @xmath17 ( which is not expected to be unity  @xcite , though with poor theoretical precision ) .",
    "these measurements are important in their own right , and , due to similarities between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 sectors , will also improve understanding of @xmath19 semileptonic decays .",
    "in particular , knowledge of the previously unmeasured ratio @xmath17 enables a more reliable prediction of the difference of the inclusive decay rates between @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons in @xmath22 decays , thereby reducing theoretical uncertainty  @xcite in determination of weak mixing parameter @xmath23 .",
    "two sets of open - charm data samples are used to study the semileptonic decays of charm and charmed - strange mesons . in @xmath24 collisions provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) , the cleo - c detector has collected integrated luminosities of @xmath3 pb@xmath4 at the center - of - mass energy @xmath5 gev near the peak of the @xmath25 resonance which decays to @xmath26 pairs , and @xmath8 pb@xmath4 at @xmath9 gev near the peak production of @xmath10 pairs . the former data set contains @xmath27 @xmath6 and @xmath28 @xmath29 pairs , and is used to study @xmath0 and @xmath1 semileptonic decays .",
    "the latter data set contains @xmath30 @xmath10 pairs , and is used to study @xmath2 semileptonic decays .",
    "we have previously reported  @xcite measurements of inclusive semileptonic decay branching fractions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons with a subsample of the former data set .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "the cleo - c detector is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : detector ] .",
    "event reconstruction and selection criteria are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : event_selectuon ] . the analysis procedure to extract semileptonic decay rates",
    "is covered in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .",
    "results for inclusive spectra are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . systematic uncertainty in our measurements",
    "is evaluated in sec .",
    "[ sec : systematic_uncertainty ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] a summary of our results is provided .",
    "the cleo - c detector  @xcite is a general - purpose solenoidal detector equipped with four concentric components : a six - layer vertex drift chamber , a 47-layer main drift chamber , a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and a cesium iodide electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the detector provides acceptance of @xmath31% of the full @xmath32 solid angle for both charged particles and photons .",
    "the main drift chamber provides specific - ionization ( @xmath33 ) measurements that discriminate between charged pions and kaons .",
    "the rich detector covers approximately @xmath34% of @xmath32 and provides additional separation of pions and kaons at high momentum ( @xmath35 mev ) .",
    "electron identification is based on a likelihood variable that combines the information from the rich detector , @xmath33 , and the ratio of electromagnetic shower energy to track momentum ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a geant - based  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is used to study efficiencies of signal and background events .",
    "physics events are generated by evtgen  @xcite , tuned with improved knowledge of charm decays  @xcite , and final - state radiation ( fsr ) is modeled by photos  @xcite .",
    "charm or charmed - strange mesons are always produced in pairs in our open - charm data samples .",
    "since the data are taken just above threshold , the mesons are produced in a very clean environment with no additional particles except , in the case of the @xmath37 , a photon or a neutral pion from the @xmath38 decay .",
    "the analysis proceeds by first defining a single tag ( st ) sample , in which one of the @xmath18 ( or @xmath39 ) mesons in a @xmath40 ( or @xmath37 ) event is reconstructed in a chosen hadronic decay mode , and a further double tag ( dt ) subsample in which an additional recoiling electron ( or positron ) is required as a signature of the signal semileptonic decay .",
    "absolute semileptonic branching fractions for charm or charmed - strange mesons can then be obtained from the fraction of the st sample that is dt , without requiring any knowledge of the integrated luminosity or how many mesons are produced .      to minimize the combinatorial backgrounds and systematic uncertainties ,",
    "three very clean tag modes composed of only charged particles are used : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . here",
    ", the notation @xmath43 is a shorthand label for @xmath44 events within a @xmath45 mev mass window of the @xmath46 meson peak in @xmath47 invariant mass .",
    "the inclusion of charge conjugate modes is implied throughout this article unless otherwise stated .",
    "we identify a st in the @xmath25 data sample using the energy difference @xmath48 and the beam - constrained mass difference @xmath49^{1/2 } - m_d$ ] , where @xmath50 is the energy of the tag , @xmath51 is the beam energy , @xmath52 is the three momentum of the tag , and @xmath53 is the nominal mass  @xcite of the neutral or charged charm meson .",
    "we require the @xmath41 and @xmath42 tags to have @xmath54 within a @xmath55 mev mass window around the nominal @xmath18 mass .    for data collected at the center - of - mass energy of @xmath56 mev",
    ", we identify a st by using the invariant mass of the tag @xmath57 and recoil mass against the tag @xmath58 .",
    "the recoil mass is defined as @xmath59^{1/2 } % = % \\ { [ e_{ee } - ( m^2_{d_s } + |{\\bf p}_{d_s}|^2)^{1/2 } ] ^2 %   - |{\\bf p}_{ee } - { \\bf p}_{d_s}|^2 \\}^{1/2 } $ ] , where @xmath60 is the net four - momentum of the @xmath24 beam taking the finite beam crossing angle into account , and @xmath61 is the four - momentum of the tag , with @xmath62 computed from @xmath63 and the nominal mass  @xcite of the @xmath39 meson .",
    "we require the recoil mass to be within @xmath64 mev of the @xmath65 mass  @xcite .",
    "this loose window allows both primary and secondary ( from @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) @xmath39 tags to be selected .",
    "we veto tag candidates with track momenta below @xmath68 mev to reduce the background from @xmath69 decays ( through @xmath70 ) .",
    "the @xmath71 and @xmath72 distributions obtained from data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : st ] . to estimate the backgrounds from the wrong tag combinations , we use the sidebands of the @xmath71 distribution or the tag mass difference @xmath73 distribution , where @xmath74 is the nominal mass  @xcite of the @xmath39 meson .",
    "we define the signal and sideband regions in table  [ table : signal - sideband - region ] .",
    "we fit the distributions to a sum of a double - gaussian function ( for signal ) and a second order chebyshev polynomial function ( for background ) to determine the tag sideband scaling factor @xmath75 , which is the ratio of areas in the signal and sideband regions described by the background polynomial function . obtained st yields and tag sideband scaling factors",
