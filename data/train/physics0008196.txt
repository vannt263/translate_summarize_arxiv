    "multiple coulomb scattering of charged particles , also called intra - beam scattering , has important applications in accelerator operation .",
    "it causes a diffusion process of particles and leads to an increase of beam size and emittance .",
    "this results in a fast decay of the quality of beam and reduces the beam lifetime when the size of the beam is large enough to hit the aperture  @xcite .",
    "an appropriate way to study the multiple coulomb scattering is to solve the fokker - planck equations for the distribution function in six - dimensional phase space . nevertheless , the fokker - planck equations are very expensive to solve numerically even for dynamical systems possessing only a very modest number of degrees of freedom .",
    "truncation schemes or closures have had some success in extracting the behavior of low - order moments , but the systematics of these approximations remains to be elucidated . on the other hand",
    ", the fokker - planck equations can be solved using an equivalent langevin simulation , which reduces the six - dimensional partial differential equations into a group of stochastic ordinary differential equations .",
    "compared to the fokker - planck equation , stochastic differential equations are not difficult to solve , and with the advent of modern supercomputers , it is possible to run very large numbers of realizations in order to compute low - order moments accurately . in general",
    ", the noise in these stochastic ordinary differential equations are multiplicative instead of additive since the dynamic friction coefficient and diffusion coefficient in the fokker - planck equations depend on the spatial position .",
