    "in contrast to short baseline detectors , the event rate in long baseline detectors is not sensitive to the geometry of the detector since the entire detector will always be bathed uniformly by the forward - going neutrino flux .",

    "event rates for oscillation experiments will probably be less of an extrapolation from today s experiments than will be the case for interaction experiments due to the compensating rate decrease at the expected longer baselines .",
    "correspondingly , the innovations in neutrino detector design required to upgrade to the neutrino beams at @xmath2mcs are likely to be rather less substantial for oscillation experiments at long baselines than for interaction physics experiments .",
    "two significant changes expected for the design of oscillation detectors for @xmath2mcs are that ( i ) the 2-component beams provide strong motivation for a magnetic spectrometer to distinguish muon charge signs ; and ( ii ) larger detector masses might be financially justified in order to fully exploit the large financial investment in the muon storage ring .",
    "design considerations for detectors for oscillation @xmath2mcs are discussed in more detail in chapter  [ ch : osc ] .",
    "in contrast to oscillation experiments , the increase in neutrino yield for @xmath2mcs relative to beams from pion decays as well as the collimation of the neutrino beams will allow the use of compact , specialized targets surrounded by high performance detectors .",

    "these apparent vices can , however , be turned into virtues .",
    "since the weak dynamics apparently hold no secrets , one can employ charm decays as a laboratory to study qcd in the interface of perturbative and non - perturbative dynamics .",

    "decays would provide us with valuable novel insights into the inner workings of qcd and at the same time sharpen our tools for a quantitative treatment of @xmath83 decays .",
    "as the discussion about the charm content in the final state of @xmath83 decays illustrates , a significant bottleneck in the detailed analysis of beauty decays of the @xmath755 type is currently caused by the uncertainties in the absolute branching ratios of charm hadron decays to specified final states , in particular of @xmath734 , @xmath754 and @xmath756",
    ". a @xmath2mc should be well suited to obtaining these branching ratios , as we now discuss .",
    "this information will be useful even if it is obtained only after the next generation of @xmath83 experiments have accumulated their samples .",
    "as what is typically the less difficult part of the measurements , the expected excellent particle identification and event reconstruction at @xmath2mcs should give good capabilities for determining relative branching ratios for each hadron .",
    "the more difficult task of obtaining the production normalization factors to convert these to absolute branching ratios should then be achieved by fitting the experimental decay length distributions in a procedure that was studied for the cosmos ( e803 ) neutrino experiment at fermilab .",

    "one for each charmed hadron species  in the observed neutral and charged distributions for the variable @xmath757 , with @xmath60 the charmed hadron distance to the decay vertex and @xmath191 its reconstructed momentum .",
    "it is helpful that the exponential decay constants in this variable are well separated for both the charged and neutral hadron distributions : @xmath758 and @xmath759    auxiliary information for the fit will be available from particle identification in the detector . in particular , the presence of a proton in the final state will reliably indicate the decay of a baryon rather than a meson .    to test the method for the cosmos environment ,",
    "exponential fits were performed  @xcite for simulated decay length distributions from approximately 14  000 reconstructed @xmath81 , @xmath460 and @xmath742 charm decays .",
    "the fitted statistical uncertainties for the three species were 3.4% , 12% and 5.4% , respectively .",
    "these simulations show that statistical uncertainties would be negligible for such a fit at a @xmath2mc , which would have several orders of magnitude more events .",
    "the uncertainties in the charm production rates would instead be dominated by uncertainties in modeling the level of vertexing inefficiencies .",
    "hopefully , these uncertainties could also be made small due to the favorable vertexing geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ vertexing ] and to the considerable potential for using the data itself to estimate the inefficiencies .",
    "another area where @xmath2mcs can be expected to make significant or even unique contributions is in the analysis of final states that contain _",

    "a @xmath2mc could access these modes through the expected sample of @xmath87 nc - produced @xmath762 events .",
    "vertex tagging one of the charmed hadrons would allow a search for such decay modes in the other .",
    "filling in these ` white spots ' in the map of charm decays would close or at least narrow the gap between exclusive and inclusive decays and thus can provide us with important lessons on how quark - hadron duality is realized in subclasses of total decays .",
    "for example : a quark based description leads to the prediction that the ( cabibbo suppressed ) inclusive rates driven by @xmath763 and @xmath764 should practically coincide since @xmath765 , @xmath592 @xmath766 @xmath254 . yet exclusive channels like @xmath767 and @xmath768 do not at all follow this expectation ! duality suggests that a ( near ) equality will emerge for @xmath769 @xmath770 @xmath771 . testing this expectation",
    "requires the measurement of final states with neutrals .",
    "experimental studies of multi - body decays with more than one neutral meson in the final state ( in particular , dalitz plot analyses ) also allow us to have different handles on the studies of direct @xmath136-violation in d - decays in and beyond the standard model  @xcite as well as on the dynamics of hadronic resonances governing these transitions ( see , e.g. the e791 analysis  @xcite ) .",
    "the primary goal behind measuring leptonic decays , @xmath773 , or the cabibbo suppressed versions , @xmath774 , with @xmath775 , is the desire to extract the decay constants @xmath776 and @xmath777 .",

    "in addition , these decay constants have been extracted from monte carlo simulations of qcd on the lattice with estimated uncertainties of about 20 percent on their absolute values and about 10 percent on their ratio .",
    "improvements are expected for future lattice calculations . for the proper evaluation of these calculations ,",
    "one wants to calibrate them against experimental results of similar accuracy .",
    "currently , the branching ratios for @xmath778 transitions have been measured by the cleo collaboration with large uncertainties , @xmath779 and @xmath780 .",
    "no measurement is currently available for other @xmath318 mesons although there is an upper bound : @xmath781 .",

    "charged higgs exchanges would affect the latter much more than the former .",
    "heavy quark expansions ( hqe ) allow the treatment of inclusive heavy flavor decays , including their non - perturbative aspects  @xcite .",
    "in addition to total decay widths , other central quantities are inclusive semileptonic branching ratios and decay spectra for the different meson and baryon species .",
    "these techniques provide the basis for some of the most reliable methods for extracting @xmath383 and @xmath382 in @xmath83 decays .",
    "obviously one wants to cross check these methods in a system where the ckm parameters are known , namely the charm system , by testing how precisely @xmath381 and @xmath380 can be extracted from semileptonic charm decays .",

    "the @xmath83 factories ( cleo , babar and belle ) will significantly improve the situation , but might not achieve the desired experimental accuracy .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that comparing neutrino with charged lepton spectra in semileptonic decays provides us with particularly probing insights .",
    "one has to keep the following in mind .",
    "since the expansion parameter is @xmath789 with @xmath790 gev , one has to allow for uncalculated higher order contributions to modify the results significantly in charm decays . to have a handle on this complication , one needs to be able to perform detailed comparisons of the lepton spectra separately in @xmath746 , @xmath81 , @xmath734 and @xmath754 decays , which should be possible at @xmath2mc s .",
