    "<S> , we have not taken into account the screening effect . even though we consider the single layer two - dimensional systems , the screening effect is not negligible for type ii case , where the dos at the fermi energy is finite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the inverse of the screening length @xmath93 as the cutoff of the rg . </S>",
    "<S> it can be estimated as @xmath94 with @xmath95 being the lattice constant and @xmath96 the band width , which can be compared with @xmath97 for three - dimensional case . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:4](b ) is realized . </S>",
    "<S> electron interaction effects speed up the velocities at low energies , and hence modify the energy dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dispersion can be measured by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the dos @xmath99 changes as well , and it can be observed , for example , by the local magnetic susceptibility @xmath100 , which is measured by nuclear magnetic resonance . when the hamiltonian is spin independent , the spin susceptibility at temperature @xmath101 is obtained as  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the fermi distribution . when electron - electron interaction is absent , the dos @xmath99 is proportional to the energy @xmath104 , and thus the spin susceptibility is linear in temperature , @xmath105 . for the tilted wfs of type i , </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the velocities due to the electron - electron interaction reduces the dos at low energies , and hence the spin susceptibility @xmath100 is suppressed by electron interactions at low temperatures  @xcite . on the other hand , for type ii , there are van hove singularities corresponding to maximum , minimum and saddle points of the energy dispersion [ fig .  </S>",
