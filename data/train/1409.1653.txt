    "in the quest to fully understand quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) it is not sufficient to study baryons whose valence quark content consists only of the light @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "a solid understanding of all members of the baryon octet  that is , the nucleon , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 multiplets  remains a critical step .",
    "early work on their structure centered on the constituent quark model  @xcite and the mit bag model  @xcite , later supplemented by chiral corrections associated with the cloud of virtual pions and kaons that surround a baryon  @xcite .",
    "once their basic properties , such as masses , charge radii , magnetic moments and axial charges had been calculated , attention naturally turned to more complex properties , such as their parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "the empirical evidence concerning the structure of the hyperons is naturally far more limited than for nucleons .",
    "while we have fairly good data for their masses , magnetic moments and axial charges  @xcite , little or nothing is known concerning their electromagnetic or axial form factors as a function of momentum transfer . finding ways to explore these properties",
    "experimentally would be very valuable .",
    "on the other hand , over the last couple of decades lattice qcd has made steady progress in the calculation of octet baryon masses  @xcite , including determinations of their isospin mass splittings  @xcite , and certain electroweak matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "these studies have been complemented by a judicious use of chiral effective field theory in order to extrapolate to the physical quark masses .",
    "thus , we now have quite accurate determinations of the hyperon electric  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite form factors up to 1.4 gev@xmath6 , as well as low moments of their parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "it has even been possible recently to shed some light on the proton spin puzzle  @xcite by calculating the spin fractions carried by quarks across the octet  @xcite .    on general grounds one would prefer to have models of octet baryon properties that are covariant as well as respecting the symmetries of qcd .",
    "the former is especially important if one wants to investigate parton distributions and form factors at high momentum transfer .",
    "the hope in building more sophisticated models is that through comparison with empirical data and lattice qcd studies one may develop a deeper understanding of how qcd works in the non - perturbative regime , including issues such as the importance and role of diquark correlations and chiral corrections  @xcite , as well as the transition from non - perturbative to perturbative qcd  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the masses and @xmath0 axial charges of the octet baryons within the framework of the covariant model of nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl )  @xcite , where confinement is simulated by employing proper - time regularization  @xcite .",
    "octet baryons are described by a poincar covariant faddeev equation , where scalar and axialvector diquarks correlations are assumed to play a dominant role .",
    "flavour breaking effects , introduced by a dressed strange quark that is approximately 50% heavier that the dressed light quarks , will also be studied .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",

    "the njl model was formulated as a theory of elementary fermions which encapsulated dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in a transparent manner  @xcite . with the advent of qcd ,",
    "it was reformulated with quarks as the fundamental degrees of freedom , such that the symmetries of qcd are respected . colour gauge symmetry of qcd is a global symmetry of the njl model . ] in particular the njl model exhibits dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , which , as implemented in this work , gives rise to approximately @xmath7% of the nucleon mass .",
