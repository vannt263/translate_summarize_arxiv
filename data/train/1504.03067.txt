    "tev @xmath0-ray binaries are a subclass of binaries with a compact object , established in the 2000 s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "these systems have a spectral energy distribution with a peak beyond 1 mev and are variable at multi - wavelengths up to tev energies .",
    "there are 5 known binaries of this kind , all of which have either an o - type main - sequence star or a be star with a circumstellar disk as the optical counterpart .",
    "the nature of the compact object is unknown in all systems but one ( ) . for such systems two competing scenarios have been proposed , based on the different nature of the compact object , and hence the different mechanism of high energy emissions .",
    "one scenario assumes that the collision between a relativistic pulsar wind and a stellar wind and/or circumstellar disk produces strong shocks , where the high energy emission arises ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this pulsar wind scenario has successfully been applied to . on the other hand ,",
    "the other scenario assumes the presence of an accreting black hole ( or neutron star ) . in this microquasar or accretion / ejection scenario ,",
    "a large amount of mass transferred from a companion star powers relativistic jets , where @xmath0-ray emission originates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "( @xmath6 ) is a recently established tev @xmath0-ray binary @xcite comprised of a b0ve star and a compact object of unknown nature .",
    "the orbit is wide and highly eccentric ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the system shows correlated variability in the x - ray and tev energy bands @xcite , with two peaks in one orbital cycle : the primary outburst prior to apastron ( orbital phase @xmath8 = 0.30.4 ) and the secondary outburst after it ( @xmath9 0.60.9 ) , with an x - ray dip in between .",
    "this is puzzling , given that these outbursts and the dip occur when the compact object is orbiting very far from the be star .",
    "understanding the mechanism for these phenomena is one of the key issues of this system .",
    "the optical counterpart of , , is established to be a classical be star , i.e. , a massive star with a geometrically thin , circumstellar disk , where balmer and other emission lines originate @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the h@xmath2 emission line after apastron ( @xmath9 0.70.8 ) .",
    "their profiles over continuous 35 days showed an `` s - shaped '' variability with a period of @xmath4 60 days .",
    "@xcite reported the orbital modulation in the h@xmath2 line profile parameters , likely caused by the interaction between the be disk and the compact object .",
    "however , the lack of observations in @xmath8=0.60.8 makes it difficult to constrain the modulation after apastron .    in order to constrain the interaction between the",
    "be disk and the compact object , we have been monitoring  using various methods such as high - dispersion spectroscopy , photometry , and polarimetry . in this paper",
    "we report the initial result of the line profile variabilities over 160 days from 2013 october to 2014 april , covering the second half of the orbital period . in sect .",

    "we calculated the orbital phase , @xmath8 , taking the orbital period of 315 days from @xcite and the origin ( jd 2454857.5 ) from @xcite , and setting the periastron phase to be 0 ( in @xcite , it is set to 0.967 ) .",
    "note that , although @xcite determined the ephemeris using the orbital period of 321 days , the orbital parameters remain approximately unchanged @xcite .",

    "the spectra covered a wavelength range of 370010500   with a resolving power of @xmath13 .",

    "the vertical scale of the h@xmath2 line profile is half that of the other line profiles , because the flux is much stronger in the h@xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath2 line is very strong ( @xmath17 ) and significantly asymmetric .",

    "the h@xmath2 line changed from a red - enhanced profile to a rather symmetric profile , while the stronger peak of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath0 lines changed from the red side to the blue side . in the residual spectra of these lines ,",

    "simultaneously , the faint part at @xmath28 migrates in the opposite direction . at the same time , the maximum and minimum , respectively at @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the residual spectra , migrate in a similar fashion .",
    "the period of these variations is estimated at @xmath31 days using fourier analysis , which is about twice the @xmath32-day variation period reported by @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in the next section . on the other hand , in the short term ( @xmath33 days )",
    ", a bright hump appears at @xmath29 in balmer line profiles at @xmath34 .",
    "this hump disappears by @xmath35 ( see the third , forth , and fifth profiles from the bottom in figs . [",
    "fig : prof_ind ] and [ fig : prof_diff ] ) .",
    "when the hump appears , ew(h@xmath2 ) increases by @xmath36 and fwhm(h@xmath2 ) decreases by @xmath37 .",
    "these long- and short - term variabilities respectively seem to occur in phase in different lines , although time lags between lines can not be ruled out because of the low cadence of the observations .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the orbital modulation of the profile parameters of the h@xmath2 line .",
    "their data cover the phase intervals of 00.6 and 0.81 , using the orbital period of 321 days @xcite .",
    "if we take the same orbital period , our data spans the orbital phase 0.41 , which overlaps with @xcite in the phase range 0.40.6 and 0.81 and provides for the first time the modulation data in the phase interval of 0.60.8 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prof_param_ha ] , ew(h@xmath2 ) seems to increase ( phase 0.40.5 ) and then decrease back to the previous value in about 30 days ( phase 0.50.6 ) , as reported by @xcite .",
    "afterwards , it seems to fluctuate for about 60 days ( phase 0.60.8 ) , which could be associated with the variabilities mentioned above .",
    "@xmath22(h@xmath2 ) , whose variation is thought to reflect the orbital motion of the be star , shows a similar pattern to @xcite except just after the apastron and just before the periastron .",
    "this difference in @xmath22 is possibly caused by the profile variabilities .",
    "fwhm(h@xmath2 ) , on the other hand , shows a different variation pattern from @xcite .",
    "it stays constant except around apastron ( phase 0.450.55 for the period of 321 days ) in this work , whereas in @xcite it showed a sinusoidal pattern .",
    "although many lines are contaminated by neighboring lines , there are six less - contaminated lines ( @xmath385018 , 5316 , 5363 , 5535 , 6433 , and 6456",
    " ) that enable us to analyze the line profile variabilities . in our analysis , we have used these six lines . the averaged @xmath395363 line profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : profave ] is shown as a representative profile .",
    "in contrast to the balmer lines , the emission lines show symmetric double - peaked profiles , as predicted for a rotating , axi - symmetric disk .",
    "figures [ fig : prof_ind ] and [ fig : prof_diff ] also display the time sequence of the observed and residual @xmath395363 profiles , respectively . as seen in these figures , lines exhibited no variation .",
    "@xcite analyzed the spectra of several be stars and confirmed that emission lines arise from a disk region of radius of @xmath40 .",
    "they also found empirical relationships between the projected rotational velocity of the central star ( @xmath41 ) and the profile parameters .",
    "applying their relationships , we have derived @xmath41 to be @xmath42 . finally , we estimate the radii of emitting regions of balmer lines . for the h@xmath2 line , we use the mean peak separation of the last six profiles ( @xmath43 ) , because the averaged profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : profave ] , in which all our observed epochs were used , has too complicated features to determine the peak velocities . for the h@xmath3 and h@xmath0 lines , we use the averaged profiles . as a result",
    ", we have the peak separations of the h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , and h@xmath0 lines to be @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . adopting @xmath41",
    "derived above , we obtain the radii of the emitting region of these lines as @xmath47 @xmath5 ( h@xmath2 ) , 11 @xmath5 ( h@xmath3 ) , and 7 @xmath5 ( h@xmath0 ) , where @xmath48 is the radius of the be star .    throughout our monitoring period ( from apastron to periastron ) , optical brightness of  stayed constant in the range of 9.059.32 ( @xmath14 ) mag , 8.538.71 ( @xmath49 ) mag , and 8.588.67 ( @xmath50 ) mag , within the typical 1-@xmath51 error of 0.05 mag .",
    "the average values are @xmath52 mag , @xmath53 mag and @xmath54 mag .",
    "although the monitoring was performed mostly after apastron , the line profiles exhibited remarkable variabilities .",
    "wide wavelength coverage revealed that the variations are seen not only in the h@xmath2 line but also in the h@xmath3 and h@xmath0 lines .",
    "no variation in lines indicates the inner part of the be disk was kept undisturbed during the observing period .",
    "this fact is in agreement with little variability in the optical brightness , which is thought to originate from the disk region within 23 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the slight , but significant , variation in the h@xmath0 line profile implies that the interaction with the compact object affects the be disk down to , at least , a radius of 7 @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamical residual spectra of the balmer lines showed an s - shaped variation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof_diff ] ) , as @xcite reported .",
    "high - dispersion residual spectra clearly show that there are two pairs of peaks at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the lower velocity peaks are the same as those of @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "the period of the variation is @xmath4150 days , which is about twice the @xmath4 60-day variation period @xcite .",
    "the s - shaped variation seen in many be stars is thought to be caused by global disk oscillations .",
    "they are mostly low - frequency @xmath57 oscillations , where @xmath58 is the azimuthal wave number @xcite , but in eccentric binaries , it is also possible that @xmath59 oscillations are excited by the corresponding fourier components of the tidal potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the period of observed variation is @xmath4 150 days , about half the orbital period , it might be due to an @xmath60 oscillation mode in the be disk , which could be excited by the @xmath60 fourier component of the tidal potential of the compact object .",
    "the difference of the periods between this work and @xcite might be caused by the difference of the length and frequency of the observations . because we observed  for about half an orbital cycle ( @xmath61 days ) ,",
    "variabilities of this timescale can be detected . with low cadence of observation , typically once every 1020 days , however , profile variabilities of shorter timescales are invisible . on the contrary , the short monitoring epoch of @xcite ( 35 days ) would have hidden the variability with longer timescales ( @xmath62 days ) .",
    "moreover , observations of this work and @xcite have an interval of @xmath41800 days . therefore , there are possibilities that the oscillation mode has changed or that both oscillation modes exist .",
    "in addition to the s - shaped variation , a remarkable variability was seen in the balmer lines after apastron ( @xmath8=0.600.65 ) .",
    "the short lifetime of this variability ( @xmath63 days ) indicates that it is temporarily caused by an external force such as the tidal force and the ram pressure of the pulsar wind , because internal waves / oscillations have much longer lifetimes ( @xmath64 days ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it is surprising , however , that such a remarkable variability appeared after apastron , when the interaction is expected to be weak because of the large distance between the be disk and the compact object . in order to understand this phenomenon , it is essential to constrain the starting phase and repeatability of the variability .",
    "comparison of the ew(h@xmath2 ) between this work and @xcite implies the presence of a regular orbital modulation , but different absolute values due to different spectral resolutions make it difficult to quantitatively analyze it .",
    "given the orbital period close to one year , it is necessary to monitor over two or three more successive cycles , within the timescale of be disk variability ( @xmath65 days ) , in order to cover the full orbital phase with the same spectral resolution .",
    "because the compact object is located far away from the be star around apastron ( @xmath66 ) , the gas in the be disk at the radius of 7 @xmath5 can not be significantly affected by the tidal force of the compact object , whose strength is less than @xmath67 of the gravity of the be central star at this radius .",
    "this leaves the interaction with the pulsar wind as the most likely mechanism for the balmer line variability .    at the periastron passage , on the other hand ,",
    "the compact object is thought to pass through the be disk at @xmath68 .",
    "nonetheless , the h@xmath3 line , emitted from the disk region of the similar radius , showed no remarkable variation at @xmath690.06 ( see the top profile in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : prof_ind ] ) .",
    "this fact suggests that either the tidal interaction is very weak in this system or the orbital period is longer than 315 days , so that the compact object had not passed the disk yet at the time of observation .",
    "the former possibility could be realized if the be disk rotates in the retrograde direction or is tilted by a large angle with respect to the orbital plane , where the disk gas and the compact object interact on a very short timescale .",
    "future observations at significantly later phases will distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "as described in sects .",
    "[ sec : short ] and [ sec : imp ] , our observations leave the pulsar wind model as the sole candidate for . if the compact object is a pulsar , little line profile variation around periastron ( the top two profiles in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : prof_diff ] ) suggests that the pulsar wind is too weak to significantly affect the be disk during these phases .",
    "@xcite proposed a flip - flop scenario for another gamma - ray binary , , where the pulsar is in a rotationally powered regime in the apastron , while it is in a propeller regime in the periastron ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . in a flip - flop system ,",
    "if the gas pressure of the be disk overcomes the pulsar - wind ram pressure , the pulsar wind is quenched . because the be disk of",
    "is estimated to be about three times larger than the binary separation at periastron , the compact object crosses a dense region of the disk near the periastron .",
    "in such a situation , the strong gas pressure is likely to quench the pulsar wind and hence suppress high - energy emissions . in the framework of the pulsar wind model , there are a few mechanisms that might explain the short - term episodic variability discussed above .",
    "the be disk is likely as large as the binary orbit because of no tidal truncation in highly eccentric , large orbit @xcite . because the disk density rapidly decreases with radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wind from the pulsar close to the outer part of the disk effectively changes its structure , giving rise to remarkable variability in emission lines arising from the disk outer part .",
    "if the be disk is misaligned with the orbital plane and a node happens to be in the direction corresponding to the phase of the variation ( @xmath70 ) , the pulsar - wind effect on the be disk will be the strongest in this phase interval .",
    "after @xmath71 the pulsar comes close to the denser disk region , which is not easily affected by the pulsar wind .",
    "this might be a cause of the short - term episodic variation after aspastron .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the pulsar wind can affect the inner disk at the radius of 7 @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , the short - term post - apastron variations might be explained as the emission from the gas captured by the pulsar , if the pulsar wind is not strong enough to expel the surrounding gas .",
    "this picture seems to fit well with the flip - flop model . at any rate ,",
    "observational investigation in the first half of the orbital cycle is needed in order to further test the pulsar - wind scenario .",
    "the next periastron passage of  will take place in 2015 december , according to the ephemeris of @xcite ( 2016 january if the ephemeris is taken from @xcite ) .",
    "observations covering this period will provide more clues to the complex interaction and the nature of the compact object in this puzzling @xmath0-ray binary .",
