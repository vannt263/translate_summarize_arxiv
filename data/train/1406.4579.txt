    "<S> the wlcm analysis led to a significantly larger numerical value for the electromagnetic contribution to the p - n mass difference but with a rather large uncertainty , @xmath6 this may be compared with the value of gasser and leutwyler , based on the standard cottingham sum - rule , of @xmath7  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach to this problem involves the direct calculation of the electromagnetic contribution to the mass shift using lattice qcd  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most recently , the bmw collaboration  @xcite reported a value of @xmath8 .    in the wlcm formalism </S>",
    "<S> , the total electromagnetic contribution to the p - n mass shift , denoted by @xmath9 , is written as the sum of five terms , @xmath10 the terms @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are uncontroversial and can be evaluated very accurately . using the kelly parametrization of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors  @xcite and modern knowledge of the structure functions  @xcite , one finds  @xcite @xmath14 where we have combined the uncertainties in quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> ( following wlcm , the counter term , @xmath15 , which is related to the @xmath16-n sigma commutator is set to zero with an uncertainty of @xmath17 . ) on the other hand , the inelastic subtraction term , which as a matter of principle should be considered together with the very small counter term introduced by collins , has been reported as @xmath18 this large uncertainty , which in turn dominates the overall uncertainty on @xmath19 , results from the uncertainty associated with the isovector nucleon magnetic polarizability , which was taken to be @xmath20 in this letter , we use data from the rbc collaboration  @xcite for the electromagnetic mass shift as a function of quark mass to provide an improved constraint on the inelastic subtraction term of wlcm . in this way </S>",

    "<S> that is , we use @xmath31 following  @xcite , one can use a pad approximant to quite accurately parametrize the magnetic moments @xmath32 the chiral coefficients for the isovector and isoscalar moments have been fixed at the values required by chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the parameters @xmath35 , in units of @xmath36 , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath45 is the nucleon mass and @xmath46 is the isovector anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon ( in the chiral limit ) .    the isoscalar dipole masses are observed to be roughly linear in @xmath47 , @xmath48 the parameters are determined by fitting lattice data from the qcdsf collaboration  @xcite , @xmath49 in units of @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron can be reconstructedthrough @xmath53 figure  [ fig : chiral - extrapolation ] shows the total elastic contribution to the proton - neutron mass difference , computed at two lattice volumes . </S>",
    "<S> while the general behavior of the calculation is in agreement with the lattice simulations , there is a clear discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is identified with the finite volume version of the inelastic contribution , @xmath54 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fullsplitting ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath12 is so small , we expect that any finite volume corrections to it will be well within the uncertainty quoted by wlcm and therefore we simply include the physical value ( @xmath55 ) in our calculation .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon electromagnetic polarizabilities have been investigated in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath56 does not depend on the unknown low energy constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which appear in the separate expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath61 terms in @xmath59 and @xmath60 cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus we finally obtain : @xmath62 with the model independent coefficient , @xmath63 , fixed by chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , @xmath64 the other two parameters , determined by fitting the results given in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : beta - mpi ] , are summarised in tab .  [ tab : betafit - parameter ] and the results of those fits are illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the physical values for @xmath56 , obtained by extrapolating to the physical pion mass , are also shown in the last column of tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : betafit - parameter ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that even though the values of @xmath56 found at each value of the pion mass tend to be systematically smaller for the cubic form factor than for the quartic form factor , the values deduced at the physical pion mass are in fairly good agreement within their respective uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we make a conservative estimate by taking the average value of these two results , @xmath65 this value is of the right sign and order of magnitude compared with the experimental result  @xcite , albeit with a significant smaller error .    in the infinite volume limit , the inelastic subtraction term contributes to the electromagnetic p - n mass splitting as    @xmath66    again , we take the conservative approach of averaging these two results : @xmath67 where the dominant source of uncertainty comes from the model dependence arising from the choice of a cubic or quartic form factor in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : inelastic - subtraction - term ] ) . combining this with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3parts ] ) , we finally obtain the total electromagnetic contribution to the proton - neutron mass splitting , @xmath68 in summary , we have carried out an analysis of the rbc lattice simulations of the electromagnetic proton - neutron mass splitting using the modified cottingham sum rule of wlmc . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an improved constraint on the inelastic subtraction term , which was the major source of uncertainty in their work . </S>",
    "<S> the isovector nucleon magnetic polarizability was extracted as a function of pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> the physical value , obtained by chiral extrapolation to the physical pion mass , showed a significant improvement in precision in comparison with the current experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we were able to obtain the more accurate result for the overall electromagnetic contribution to the proton - neutron mass difference given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : emresult ] )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn allows us to deduce a more accurate value for the size of the contribution to the proton - neutron mass difference arising from the difference of the masses of the up and down quarks , namely @xmath69 mev </S>",
