    "from a symmetrical point of view , the solids in nature are classified as crystals , quasicrystals , and noncrystals@xcite .",
    "the crystal structure is characterized by a periodic arrangement of atoms in space , the waves propagating in crystals have a bloch wave form . according to the bloch theorem all states",
    "are extended in space and eigenenergies form continuous band structures . for fully disordered noncrystal",
    ", it is believed that all states are localized in space and energy spectra are singular continuous .",
    "quasicrystal is a unique type of structure which lies at the boundary between translation invariant crystals and random glassy materials@xcite .",
    "though lacking long - range translational symmetry , it possesses a certain orientational order . to understand the interim situation between crystals and noncrystals ,",
    "much research works have been carried out on quasicrystals , especially since the experimental discovery of quasicrystal phase in an al - mn alloy with icosahedral symmetry@xcite .",
    "the simplest structural model describing quasicrystals is the fibonacci lattice model .",
    "it has received a great deal of attention@xcite since it contains the basic ingredients of quasicrystals and is relatively easy to deal with .",
    "the fibonacci lattice model is famous for its cantor - set spectrum , the self - similar spectrum is identified as critical eigenstates which is neither extended as in periodic system , nor localized as in disordered ones@xcite .    to explore the spectral evolution from the translational invariant crystals to fully disordered materials , a structural model which is tunable between the two extreme cases are highly desirable .",
    "a simple fibonacci lattice model is certainly a good candidate since its symmetry lies in between , but it is not good enough since its order is not adjustable . in this respect ,",
    "the generalized fibonacci lattice model with @xmath0-component ( @xmath0-cf ) offers an excellent choice and its order can be tuned by the parameter @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-cf lattice can be obtained by repeated application of the concurrent substitution rules @xmath4 , @xmath5(@xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 are the @xmath0-components and @xmath8 is the substitution operator . the @xmath9th generation sequence of @xmath0-cf lattice is defined as @xmath10 and the generalized @xmath0-cf lattice corresponds to @xmath11 .",
    "the first few generation sequences are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "in general , @xmath17(@xmath18 ) . the generalized @xmath0-cf lattice recovers the periodic lattice if @xmath0 is set to @xmath19 , it also naturally reproduces the standard fibonacci lattice when @xmath20 .",
    "what s unique about the generalized @xmath0-cf lattice is that it can be tuned smoothly from periodic , to quasiperiodic , and then finally to non - quasiperiodic lattices as @xmath0 changes . as shown by hu _",
    "et al._@xcite , the information on the quasiperiodicity of a @xmath0-cf lattice is encoded in the substitution matrix @xmath21 whether the @xmath0-cf lattice is quasiperiodic or not is closely associated with the pisot number of characteristic polynomial equation @xmath22 . a pisot number is present if the characteristic polynomial equation has only one root @xmath23 and all its conjugate roots have their norms less than 1 . following the bombier - taylor theorem",
    ", the existence of pisot number guarantees that the @xmath0-cf lattice is quasiperiodic and can be generated by the cut and projection method@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite showed that quasiperiodic lattice exists only if @xmath24 ; @xmath19 corresponds to a periodic lattice while lattices with @xmath25 , though still ordered , is no longer quasiperiodic .",
    "in fact , a close inspection of the root structure suggests that @xmath2 lattice should be classified as a critical case since there is a pair of conjugate roots having their norms equal 1 , which neither belongs to the quasiperiodic case where all conjugate roots have their norms less than 1 , nor belongs to a non - quasiperiodic case where some of the conjugate roots have their norms larger than 1 .",
    "the pisot numbers are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , respectively",
    ".    above discussion suggests that @xmath0-cf lattice covers a wide range of lattice types from periodic , quasiperiodic , critical , and non - quasiperiodic lattices , it offers a natural platform to study the spectra evolution with structural ordering .",
    "though extensive investigations have been carried out on the electronic@xcite , vibrational@xcite , and dielectric@xcite properties of quasiperiodic structures as a vehicle to study the evolution process from ordered periodic structures to disordered solids , the most previous studies concentrated on the standard fibonacci lattices@xcite and the generalized 2-component fibonacci lattices@xcite , the generalized @xmath0-cf lattices are mostly discussed in the context of structural properties@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the previous studies mostly dealt with the single degree problems , and studies on the mode - coupling problems with energy transfer between different degrees of freedom are only a few@xcite .",
    "thus , we have carried out a comprehensive study in this communication on the band - gap structures of @xmath0-cf piezoelectric superlattices .",
    "the transfer - matrix - method is explored so that the band - gap structures can be most easily visualized through the imaginary wave number .",
    "our study show that the band - gap structures can be classified into a series of big cluster in the frequency spectrum . for each @xmath0-cf superlattice ,",
    "the self - similar spectrum and recovery rule are present within each generation and across different generations @xmath9 .",
    "consistent with the rigorous mathematical proof , we find that the @xmath0-cf superlattices with @xmath1 can be identified as quasiperiodic .",
    "the band - gaps are characterized by the self - similarity behavior and all the gaps can be properly indexed ; the @xmath2 superlattice belongs to a critical case which lies at the border between quasi - periodic to non - quasiperiodic structures .",
    "the frequency range of self - similar spectrum approaches zero , a unique indexing of band - gaps becomes impossible .",
    "in this communication , we use superlattices made of piezoelectric linbo@xmath31 compound as our model systems@xcite . to distinguish different components of @xmath0-cf superlattices@xcite",
    ", each component is made of a pair of positively and negatively polarized ferroelectric domains of varying lengths ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) . for simplicity and also for setting up length scale , the lengths of positively polarized domains of all components are taken to be the same @xmath34 , while the lengths of negatively polarized domains are used to differentiate the different components .",
    "a typical superlattice for a given @xmath0-cf sequence and for a given generation @xmath9 is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the experimental setting and material parameters are described in detail in the references.@xcite    to calculate the band - gap structures of @xmath0-cf lattices , we use the sequence of @xmath9th generation as a supercell to form a periodic lattice . in this case , the lattice constant @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of @xmath37th component in @xmath9th generation sequence and @xmath38 is the reduced length of @xmath37th component@xcite .",
    "the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors are @xmath39s with @xmath40 denoting an integer , the reduced wave number @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the essential information on the @xmath9th generation of @xmath0-cf sequence is included in its fourier components @xmath42 .",
    "the band - gap opens at the reduced frequency @xmath43 if @xmath44 .",
    "for the special case where @xmath45 and @xmath46 can all be written as rational numbers , @xmath47 $ ] with the greatest common divisor @xmath48 , the reciprocal lattice vectors can also be written as rational numbers @xmath49 with @xmath50 denoting the least common multiple .",
    "it is easy to shown that @xmath51 vanishes when @xmath52 . in this case , the band - gap structures are divided into big clusters , the self - similarity and scaling behavior in each cluster can be used to check whether the given superlattice is quasiperiodic or not .",
    "to study the spectral evolution with generation @xmath9 for @xmath0-cf superlattices , usually the furcation pattern of eigenmodes is traced to analyze the self - similarity property and to search for the fixed point .",
    "when system involves continuum eigenmode spectra , it is better to track the furcation pattern of band - gap instead of the eignemodes since the discrete band - gap structures encode the essential information of @xmath0-cf sequences .",
    "as the band - gap represents the forbidden frequencies of eigenmodes , the wave propagating in this frequency range is attenuated at an imaginary wave number im@xmath53 . for polaritons which involve the coupling between electromagnetic wave and acoustic wave , the effective dielectric function in the vicinity of a band - gap always diverges at low band - gap edge while continuously approaches to zero at high band - gap edge .",
    "this suggests that the asymmetrical peaks symbolizing imaginary wave numbers can be used to visualize the band - gap structures . in the following",
    ", we shall systematically analyze the band - gap spectra of @xmath0-cf superlattices as functions of generation @xmath9 and component @xmath0 .",
    "since the @xmath54-cf sequence corresponds to the standard fibonacci lattices which have been extensively studied before@xcite , we concentrate on @xmath55 cases below . in choosing the components of @xmath0-cf sequence , we follow the rule so that @xmath56@xcite . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the imaginary wave numbers im@xmath53 as functions of frequency @xmath57 are presented for the 9th , 12th , and 16th generations of @xmath58-cf superlattices .",
    "the three components are chosen as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the overall patterns of the band - gap spectra look quite similar among different generations and the positions of major band - gaps are essentially independent of generations . within the same big cluster , the spectra demonstrate a certain symmetry with respect to the center of big cluster(@xmath62 ) .",
    "in addition , the big cluster is further subdivided into three smaller clusters and each subcluster has its spectral center . the spectral detail increases with generation @xmath9 for a given @xmath0 , thus the self - similarity pattern and scaling law can be analyzed when @xmath9 is large enough .    to check the quasiperiodicity of @xmath58-cf superlattice ,",
    "we follow hu _",
    "s procedure@xcite and identify the major peaks of @xmath0-cf superlattice .",
    "according to the cut and projection method@xcite , the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by @xmath63=2d^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n h_i \\eta_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is an average lattice constant and @xmath65s are any integers .",
    "@xmath66 is the relative weight of @xmath37th component and satisfies @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the pisot number of substitution matrix of @xmath0-cf sequence . for quasiperiodic superlattices of @xmath0-cf type ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 converges quickly for large generation @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath70 does not converge for aperiodic superlattices when @xmath25 .",
    "since the band - gap takes place approximately at @xmath71 , one can properly identify the various major peaks by using @xmath72 $ ] . in fig .",
    "2c , the major peaks of @xmath58-cf superlattice of large generation are labeled in this way . to investigate the self - similarity property of @xmath58-cf superlattices , the spectra of imaginary wave numbers are presented in fig .  3 for the 9th and 16th generations .",
    "with regarding to both the positions and magnitudes of the peaks , there is a clear one - to - one correspondence between them in the vicinity of the cluster center .",
    "the frequency range of the self - similar patterns is quite broad extending from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "the dynamical property of @xmath58-cf superlattices is recovered after 7-generation and the scaling parameter is @xmath75 .",
    "since the peak labeling of band - gaps is one of the essential feature of quasiperiodic superlattices , it is of interest to see how the situation goes for the @xmath76-cf and @xmath3-cf superlattices . in fig .  4a ,",
    "the spectrum for 12th generation of @xmath76-cf superlattice is presented , the four components are @xmath77 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath78 . while fig .",
    "4b is the similar spectrum for the 12th generation of @xmath3-cf superlattice with component setting @xmath79 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "labeling the band - gap peaks is a very tedious job for multi - component fibonacci superlattices since more component means denser distribution of reciprocal lattice vectors . for the @xmath76-cf superlattice , we are able to identify the major band - gap peaks with easy . as shown in fig .",
    "4a , all major peaks are uniquely labeled as it should be for the quasiperiodic lattice .",
    "the situation becomes more complex for @xmath3-cf superlattice since it lies at the border between quasiperiodic and non - quasiperiodic structures .",
    "we find that there exists three or more possible labelings for some major peaks , and their difference in wave number is less than @xmath82 , smaller than the effective digits that double precision number can offer .",
    "this non - uniqueness seems peculiar to @xmath3-cf superlattices , we believe that it may be related to its critical nature of the structure .",
    "unlike the @xmath58-cf superlattices whose band - gap spectra recovers every 7th generation around the fixed point at the cluster center , we find that the spectra for @xmath76-cf superlattices recovers every 15th generation .",
    "5 compares the imaginary wave number spectra for both the 12th generation and expanded view of 27th generation scaled by @xmath83 .",
    "due to one more component in composing the superlattice , the frequency range of self - similar patterns is significantly reduced in comparison with that of @xmath58-cf superlattices . but a clear one - to - one correspondence is still evident in the narrow range @xmath84 both for peak positions and magnitudes . if we summarize the recovery rule get so far for the fixed point near the cluster center , following deductive formula seems reasonable @xmath85 .",
    "it predicts that the spectra recover every @xmath86 for the periodic , standard fibonacci@xcite , @xmath58-cf , and @xmath76-cf superlattices .",
    "of course , the above statement holds only for the fixed point near the spectral cluster center . as a matter of fact , there are many fixed points for a given dynamical system@xcite , and they do not share the same scaling parameter at all .    if the deductive formula is right , one would expect to find the band - gap spectra of @xmath3-cf superlattices recover every 31st generation , but we did not succeed .",
    "though for different settings of components we are able to find an approximate fixed point around @xmath62 for the 3rd , 7th , and 21st generation recovery rule , none of them is perfect in the sense that either the fixed point is not strictly followed or the frequency range of self - similar spectra around the fixed point is too narrow .",
    "thus , we are led to the conclusion that the critical @xmath3-cf superlattices are characterized by two important features : ( 1 ) the major peaks can not be uniquely labeled ; ( 2 ) the frequency range of self - similarity pattern shrinks to zero .",
    "in this communication , the peak labeling and self - similarity patterns of imaginary wave number spectra are used as essential tools to cross check the nature of @xmath0-cf superlattices . for @xmath87 and @xmath88-cf superlattices , major peaks can always be labeled uniquely .",
    "there exists finite frequency range of self - similarity pattern around the fixed point and the frequency range decreases as @xmath0 increases ; for the critical case of @xmath3-cf superlattices , the unique labeling of major peaks becomes impossible and the frequency range of self - similarity pattern approaches to zero .",
    "our study substantiates the rigorous mathematical proof by hu _",
    "et al._@xcite , in particular , valuable information is supplemented on the critical @xmath3-cf structures .",
