    "in conventional @xmath5-wave superconductors the bcs quasiparticle excitation spectrum is gapped and , in presence of a vortex defect , the quasiparticles form a discrete set of caroli - degennes - matricon states@xcite .",
    "these states are bound below the gapped continuum and are described by wavefunctions that decrease exponentially away from the vortex position .",
    "once finite density of vortices is induced by a magnetic field , as is the case in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors , these discrete levels broaden into extremely narrow quasiparticle bands whose effect on bulk properties is rather modest , as long as the magnetic field @xmath6 remains well below the upper critical field @xmath7 .",
    "the situation is entirely different in high temperature cuprate superconductors : there the quasiparticle gap has a @xmath8 symmetry and vanishes at four nodal points on the fermi surface .",
    "the excitation spectrum is gapless , with linearly vanishing density of states at the fermi level . as a consequence ,",
    "there are no strictly bound states near a vortex defect in such a superconductor@xcite . instead , the quasiparticle wavefunctions exhibit a power law decrease away from vortex position and the spectrum is continuous@xcite .",
    "once a finite magnetic field is turned on and vortex lattice appears in the mixed state , the low energy quasiparticles are expected to form broad bands which dramatically influence thermodynamics , transport and vortex dynamics of high temperature superconductors .    after an early semiclassical approximation due to volovik@xcite , who suggested that quasiparticles spectrum undergoes a doppler shift @xmath9 due to the vortex - induced superflow @xmath10 at a given point @xmath11 , the quantum theory of quasiparticles in the presence of vortex lattice evolved along two somewhat separate lines .",
    "on one side , the self - consistent bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) equations for @xmath0-wave superconductor were solved numerically in continuum , both for a single vortex@xcite and for a vortex lattice@xcite .",
    "additionally , the numerical solution was also obtained for bdg equations of a tight - binding lattice @xmath0-wave superconductor with boundary conditions corresponding to a periodic vortex array@xcite . in all cases",
    "it was clearly demonstrated that a single vortex is incapable of truly localizing @xmath0-wave quasiparticles and broad low energy bands are evident in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum of a vortex lattice .",
    "solving bdg equations in the inhomogeneous mixed state , particularly for a @xmath0-wave superconductor with its extended low energy quasiparticle states , is a daunting task .",
    "it is natural to inquire whether a simpler , analytic description might be devised which will allow one to address important and realistic physics questions including disordered vortex lattice , thermal and quantum fluctuating vortices , etc . , where numerical solutions are either too forbidding or too opaque to be useful .",
    "an important step along this path is the linearized version of the bdg hamiltonian introduced by simon and lee@xcite .",
    "since the homogeneous system at zero field can be described by four species of massless two - component dirac fermions residing at nodal points on the fermi surface , it was argued that in low magnetic fields @xmath1 , when the separation between vortices given by magnetic length @xmath12 becomes much larger than the size of the vortex cores  set by the bcs coherence length @xmath13  the properties of low energy quasiparticles to the leading order in @xmath14 can still be described by a superposition of four independent hamiltonians at each node@xcite .    by devising an eponymous gauge transformation , franz and teanovi ' c@xcite",
    "recast the nodal bdg hamiltonian as that of a dirac particle moving in a zero _ average _ magnetic field and subject to effective long - range scalar and vector potentials whose point - like sources are located at vortex positions .",
    "this approach revealed that nodal quasiparticles couple to vortices through a _",
    "combined _ effect of _ two _ long - range terms : the semiclassical doppler shift must be accompanied by a purely quantum mechanical berry phase , which attaches a @xmath15 phase factor to a wavefunction of a quasiparticle encircling an @xmath16 vortex@xcite .",
    "the ft transformation has been widely used to directly address , by combination of general symmetry arguments@xcite and explicit analytic and numerical calculations , @xcite various aspects of quantum mechanics of nodal quasiparticles in presence of vortices and will serve as the departure point for our discussion@xcite .",
    "we should stress , however , that the results and conclusions of this paper are completely general and remain unaffected if instead of the ft transformed bdg hamiltonian one uses more familiar framework of the magnetic translations group applied to the original bdg equations .",
    "a natural question is why should not one simply use the magnetic translation group ( mtg ) and forgo the ft transformed problem altogether ?",
    "the answer is twofold : obviously , in the ft transformed case one is dealing with representations of ordinary bloch translation group that are far more convenient than those of mtg .",
    "more importantly , the ft transformation is custom tailored for an efficient extraction of the low - energy , long - distance sector of the original problem , a prime feature in numerous physical situations .    while the problem of @xmath0-wave nodal quasiparticles interacting with vortex defects is of considerable theoretical interest in itself , its rich phenomenology and relevance for numerous experiments on cuprates",
    "promote it to the forefront of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "in high temperature superconductors , the low field regime ( @xmath1 ) of the vortex state covers a large portion of the @xmath17 phase diagram and a large body of experimental work thought to offer clues regarding microscopic origins of high temperature superconductivity is available both for analysis and future refinements .",
    "in particular , the high resolution sts / stm measurements of tunneling conductance in ybco and bscco , which is proportional to the quasiparticle local density of states ( ldos ) , reveal peaks near vortices that appear at energies @xmath18 mev in ybco and @xmath19 mev in bscco and at magnetic fields @xmath20 tesla@xcite .",
    "the origin of the ldos peaks is still a hotly debated subject and several scenarios@xcite describing various microscopic physics inside and around vortex cores , such as spin- and charge- density waves ( sdw and cdw ) , mott insulator , @xmath0-density wave and others , have been proposed to explain these features .",
    "this structure in the quasiparticle ldos appears related to the experiments on neutron scattering@xcite which hint at the development of an antiferromagnetic order parameter localized in the vicinity of vortex cores .",
    "a mean - field factorization of @xmath21 model on a tight - binding lattice and allowing for both @xmath0-wave superconductor and af orders does indeed , for a certain range of parameters in the self - consistent solution , describe a @xmath0-wave vortex state with an af order developing inside vortex cores@xcite .",
    "the details of the calculations , however , depend strongly on the parameters of the model and the actual paring terms included in self - consistent approximation .",
    "in fact it is not even clear that the interior of vortices can be reliably described within the mean - field framework since the suppression of superconductivity inside vortices is likely to lead to a formation of a strongly correlated state characteristic of the pseudogap region in the phase diagram of cuprates@xcite .",
    "the linearized continuum formulation of the bulk properties of nodal quasiparticles has the distinct advantage of being essentially independent of such details pertaining to the structure near vortex cores .",
    "nodal bdg quasiparticle behaves like a massless dirac fermion and can be thought of as `` critical''@xcite : the feynman path integral trajectories of such particles lack any characteristic lengthscale .",
    "this `` criticality '' implies a certain degree of `` universality''@xcite : one expects that an effective low - energy theory of such dirac fermions can be constructed , which incorporates all the effects of intra - vortex physics on the bulk properties of the bdg quasiparticles in terms of few simple parameters .",
    "a detailed derivation of such an effective theory , describing the influence of the physics in vicinity of vortex cores on properties of nodal bdg quasiparticles in the bulk , is the main goal of this paper .    following ft , we start by representing the motion of nodal bdg quasiparticles in a vortex lattice by massless two - dimensional dirac fermions in combined vector and scalar potentials@xcite .",
    "both vector and scalar potentials are singular near vortices , and we will show that regularization of this singular behavior is required , which itself depends on the short - scale features of the physics near vortex cores .",
    "the final effective theory is essentially the canonical ft hamiltonian supplemented by a boundary condition at each vortex .",
    "the variety of possible physical scenarios describing different types of core and near - core behaviors is represented by a _ single",
    "_ dimensionless parameter @xmath22 that characterizes the boundary condition and is associated with each vortex . @xmath2",
    "being dimensionless , such boundary conditions can in principle modify the energy spectrum already at the leading order in @xmath23  to this order@xcite the value of @xmath2 uniquely determines the full extent of the influence that the structure in or near vortex cores has on the bulk properties of nodal quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "we generalize the conventional simon - lee scaling to include the explicit dependence on @xmath2 and numerically determine the scaling function . this generalized scaling form for the linearized quasiparticle energy levels",
    "is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a universal dimensionless function , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the band number and the bloch momentum of the ft transformed states , respectively and @xmath28 is the bare anisotropy of the @xmath0-wave nodes in a zero - field case .",
    "we find three prominent behaviors of a @xmath0-wave superconductor as @xmath29 ( while still @xmath30 ) and determine the associated self - adjoint extensions of the linearized continuum problem : the first is a gapless behavior with the dirac nodes intact ",
    "although renormalized by the field  but with their number _ doubled _ relative to the zero field result of four .",
    "this solution bears considerable resemblance to the one reported earlier in ref . .",
    "second , we find new _ gapped _ spectra with no zero energy states .",
    "this self - adjoint extension produces a dirac mass gap which scales as @xmath31 and is thus a part of the leading order @xmath29 scaling function , unlike the gaps of order @xmath32 , which vanish in the leading order scaling and are typically present even for the `` gapless '' case .",
    "the gapped solution seems to be related to the `` interference '' gapped spectra discussed in refs . .",
    "finally , we find @xmath2 for which the quasiparticle bands lack @xmath33 symmetry and for which the density of states is finite at the fermi level ",
    "such solutions , however , at least for the superconducting gap parameter @xmath34 not exceedingly small in comparison to hopping @xmath35 , as is appropriate for near optimally doped or underdoped cuprates , are never found in our numerical calculations on the lattice @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "these tight - binding calculations , reported separately@xcite , always find either a linearly vanishing or gapped density of states at the fermi level .",
    "thus , the so - called `` volovik effect , '' a defining feature of an early semiclassical approach , is effectively absent from a fully quantum mechanical solution .",
    "it would be important to verify this feature of our results experimentally , for example , by precision measurements of a specific heat or thermal conductivity .    alternatively , the above regularization and associated self - adjoint extensions can be implemented by introducing a fictitious potential which suppresses the wavefunctions of nodal quasiparticles near vortices .",
    "this potential represents the nonlinear corrections to the linearized bdg hamiltonian . because of the well - known klein paradox for dirac particles",
    ", this potential can not be chosen as a large scalar potential barrier , and instead must be realized as a position - dependent mass @xcite , which grows rapidly as one approaches a vortex location but vanishes elsewhere .",
    "we demonstrate that the two descriptions of the regularized ft hamiltonians are equivalent and yield essentially identical results in numerical calculations .",
    "a magnetic unit cell containing two vortices . panel ( b ) shows contours used in the application of the stokes theorem discussed in section [ sae ] . ]    the realization that the boundary conditions at the vortices must be externally imposed resolves the difficulty associated with previous attempts to find the spectrum of the quasiparticles numerically . despite the gauge invariance of the linearized problem ,",
    "the explicit form of the ft hamiltonian depends on the partition of the original vortex lattice into two sublattices a and b. such choice is clearly not unique , and different selections are related by singular gauge transformations .",
    "obviously , all measurable physical quantities , exemplified by the density of states ( dos ) , must be invariant under such transformations .",
    "surprisingly , numerical spectra of the linearized ft hamiltonian exhibit small but persistent difference for distinct choices of a and b sublattices , when the wavefunctions are sought as linear combinations of plane waves@xcite or when the hamiltonian is solved by discretization on a real space mesh@xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will demonstrate that the difficulties associated with the linearized model indeed are not simply a nuisance related to the numerical procedure but rather reflect a genuine dependence of the bulk properties of quasiparticles on the internal structure of vortices . even though the bulk of 2d cuo planes is dominated by pure nodal @xmath0-wave quasiparticles ,",
    "the internal vortex structure affects the spectrum through boundary conditions that should be imposed at the vortex locations , due to singular nature of the perturbation introduced by vortices , and the resulting energy spectra for different vortex core types are generally distinct to the leading order in @xmath36 .",
    "we reanalyze the solutions found earlier , and find that they correspond to mutually different sets of boundary conditions , `` spontaneously '' selected by a numerical procedure used as well as the choice of a and b sublattices .",
    "once the fixed boundary conditions are externally imposed , the numerical procedure that incorporates them generates results that are fully gauge independent .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next two sections we introduce the linearized ft hamiltonian and discuss the necessity of imposing boundary conditions ( bc ) at vortex locations .",
    "we show how these bc are intimately related to the self - adjoint extensions of the linearized bdg hamiltonian@xcite and discuss such extensions in detail in section [ sae ] . after analyzing the symmetry properties of the linearized problem with and without bc in section [ sym ] , we describe in section [ num ] a new procedure used to address the problem , which incorporates the bc numerically .",
    "section [ relation ] establishes an alternative framework for regularization of the linearized problem using mass potentials and discusses the connection between the full , non - linearized bdg equations and self - adjoint extensions of the linearized model .",
    "this is followed by a general discussion of the relation between the @xmath37 and @xmath8 continuum models in section [ orient ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief summary of our results .",
    "it was argued @xcite that in the limit of weak magnetic field @xmath38 ( but still @xmath30 ) , the bdg hamiltonian describing quasiparticles in an ideal vortex lattice can be formally expanded@xcite in powers of @xmath39 where magnetic length @xmath12 is defined through the flux quantum @xmath40 as @xmath41 . in extreme type - ii superconductors ,",
    "the regions separated from the vortices by distances sufficiently larger than vortex core size @xmath42 are accurately described by the center - of - mass superconducting order parameter @xmath43 with a nearly uniform amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "one can then avoid solving the full self - consistent problem by eliminating the effective coupling constant in favor of @xmath44 . in making this useful simplification , one",
    "implicitly excludes small disks of radius @xmath42 around each vortex in a 2d plane , where the amplitude of the order parameter varies appreciably .",
    "this amounts to a tacit assumption that , in the limit @xmath45 , the effects of the detailed structure around vortex cores on properties of the far - away nodal states in the bulk regions are entirely negligible .",
    "it is this assumption that needs to be revisited , as we will show .",
    "initially , however , we will follow this assumption in order to understand the difficulties it generates and to introduce the notation .",
    "one starts from the bdg hamiltonian for a @xmath0-wave extreme type - ii superconductor : @xmath46 the gap operator @xmath47 is given by@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the superconducting center - of - mass complex gap function , @xmath50 is its phase and curly brackets denote anticommutation operator @xmath51 , accompanied by the @xmath52 symmetrization .",
    "note that the first term@xcite in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) must be accompanied by the second@xcite to maintain gauge invariance of the bdg hamiltonian  this amounts to replacing ordinary derivatives in the first term by the covariant ones : @xmath53 , insuring minimal coupling of @xmath50 to the external electromagnetic gauge potential , with charge equal to @xmath54 .",
    "although the gap operator @xmath47 in the above form has a @xmath37 symmetry , the results for @xmath8 can be readily obtained after a simple rotation by @xmath55 .    in a uniform external magnetic field @xmath6 and in the presence of a periodic array of superconducting vortices which the field induces in @xmath49 , both diagonal terms and",
    "the gap operator in ( [ bdg ] ) are invariant under _ magnetic _ translation group transformations ( mtg ) rather than being simply periodic in space .",
    "consequently , the eigenfunctions of @xmath56 are not the ordinary bloch functions but are instead the so - called _ magnetic _ bloch functions and can be classified according to representations of mtg @xcite .",
    "an essential aspect of the problem is the observation that a simple bravais lattice of superconducting vortices contains a magnetic flux equal to @xmath16 per unit cell  this is just a reflection of the fact that a vortex is a topological defect in the phase of the gap function of cooper pairs which carry charge @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast , all representations of mtg in terms of single - valued eigenfunctions must contain an integer number of the _ electronic _ flux quanta , @xmath57 , per unit cell .",
    "it is therefore necessary to choose the unit cell of the mtg so it is at least twice as large as that of the vortex lattice@xcite .",
    "apart from this condition the shape and the size of such unit cell are arbitrary and different choices correspond to different `` gauges '' , i.e. different representations of mtg .",
    "the eigenfunctions associated with these representations are different but the spectrum of eigenvalues of @xmath56 , as measured by its density of states , is the same for all these choices of mtg .",
    "ft observed that the above features of mtg can be used to recast the original problem in a more convenient form . one first partitions the original vortex lattice into two sublattices a , b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] ) and then performs a singular gauge transformation @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 are contributions to the phase of the order parameter from vortices of a(b ) sublattice ( see @xcite and appendix a ) .",
    "after the transformation the hamiltonian assumes a periodic form : @xmath61 where the transformed gap operator is given by @xmath62 and two superfluid velocities are defined as @xmath63 properties of the superfluid velocities @xmath64 and @xmath65 are discussed at length further in the text and in the appendix .",
    "the crucial feature is that their chirality , set by @xmath66 , vanishes on _ average _ and thus @xmath67 are truly periodic functions in space . consequently , the eigenstates of the ft transformed bdg hamiltonian are ordinary bloch waves that can be classified by their crystal momentum and band index . in the limit of weak fields it is reasonable to view the low energy wavefunctions as `` perturbations '' of the nodal states at @xmath68 , and therefore the wavefunctions describing states close to the nodal point @xmath69 can be described as @xmath70 where @xmath71 changes weakly on distances of order @xmath72 . under assumptions , , and , the hamiltonian to the leading order is@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the standard pauli matrices and @xmath75 is the gauge invariant superfluid velocity .",
    "the corrections to ( [ h_ft ] ) fall into two categories : more familiar ones , of higher order in @xmath76 become arbitrarily small as @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , however , there are corrections governed by @xmath77 even as @xmath29 , which reflect the fact that nodes are located at _ finite",
    "_ momentum @xmath78 and describe rapid oscillations in quasiparticle spectra due to internodal interference@xcite .",
    "the linearized hamiltonian @xmath79 describes a massless dirac particle with anisotropic dispersion in presence of an internal gauge field @xmath80 and a scalar potential @xmath81 given by the component of @xmath10 along the node .",
    "this scalar potential is nothing but the doppler shift of nodal quasiparticle energies in the superflow field produced by vortices .",
    "the internal gauge field @xmath80  its minimal coupling to bdg quasiparticles betraying its topological origin  corresponds to an array of @xmath82 aharonov - bohm fluxes located at vortex positions and generates the required @xmath83 berry phases for fermions circling around vortices@xcite .",
    "this intrinsic topological frustration is entirely absent in semiclassical approximations@xcite but plays an essential role in the quantum mechanics of nodal quasiparticles in presence of vortices .",
    "note that @xmath80 is explicitly time - reversal invariant since the aharonov - bohm effect remains unaffected by the exchange of direction of a half - flux .",
    "this is an important feature and the necessary condition for invariance of physical results under different ft gauge transformations .",
    "different ft transformations correspond to different choices of a and b sublattices ( always , however , containing the same total number of vortices so that @xmath66 remains zero on average ) closely resembling different choices of the unit cell of the mtg .",
    "under such transformations the hamiltonian ( [ h_ft ] ) retains its general form but with half - fluxes in @xmath80 switching their signs from positive to negative depending on whether they belong to a or b sublattice , while @xmath10 remains the same in all ft gauges .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath84 is periodic and has a well defined fourier representation .",
    "while the fact that both effective potentials @xmath80 and @xmath10 diverge as @xmath85 near vortices is an obvious point of concern , resulting in matrix elements of perturbation theory that decrease only as @xmath86 in momentum space , one still reasonably expects that the path toward finding the set of eigenfunctions of @xmath84 starts by simply expanding them in a plane wave basis .",
    "comparison of energy spectra for different choices of a and b sublattices .",
    "the spectra are similar at low energies but differ significantly as energy increases@xcite .",
    "lower left : the first magnetic brillouin zone . ]    the numerical solution obtained in this manner , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta0.25pim0.25pi ] , was found to result in strongly dispersive bands at low energies .",
    "the low - energy portion of the spectrum appears qualitatively similar to the zero - field case and , most importantly , preserves nodal point : @xmath87 .",
    "the only significant effect of finite field is the renormalization of the original velocities @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the band structure calculation was also confirmed in@xcite , where the spectrum and the eigenstates of @xmath84 ( [ h_ft ] ) were obtained by discretization of the hamiltonian in real space .",
    "the persistence of nodal points was further demonstrated@xcite to be a consequence of the general symmetry properties of @xmath84 .",
    "as noted previously@xcite , the choice of a - b sublattice arrangement is not unique in the ft transformation , being merely a choice of singular gauge .",
    "clearly , measurable quantities such as the density of states ( dos ) should not depend on the partitioning of vortex lattice into various a and b sublattices . on the other hand , the hamiltonian @xmath84 has a formal dependence on the ft singular gauge choice , and surprisingly , the numerical solution exhibits small but persistent differences for different arrangements of @xmath90 and @xmath91 sublattices ( fig .",
    "[ fourvortices ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy remains regardless of whether the computation is done by expanding the solution in plane wave basis @xcite or by discretization in real space @xcite .",
    "note that these difficulties _ can not _ simply be attributed to the singular nature of the ft gauge transformation : the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian in the _ original _ representation , where the eigenfunctions are chosen as magnetic translation group eigenstates , has dos which also exhibits a similar discrepancy for different choices of a magnetic unit cell ( e.g. rectangular vs. square ) . as a remedy ,",
    "the tight - binding formulation of a @xmath0-wave bdg hamiltonian and ft transformation was introduced in@xcite , where it was verified that this so - called `` abab vs. aabb '' problem does not appear and the spectra are explicitly invariant under singular gauge transformations for arbitrary size of the tight - binding mesh . in a way , this is the resolution of the whole `` abab vs. aabb '' problem : cuo@xmath92 planes in high temperature superconductors are actually well described by an effective tight - binding hamiltonian ( of a @xmath21 , hubbard or a related variety ) and the lattice @xmath0-wave",
    "superconductor and its bdg equations is precisely what we should be considering .",
    "the problem with the singular @xmath85 behavior never arises since bdg quasiparticles live on sites while vortices are `` located '' in the interior of plaquettes of a tight - binding lattice .",
    "nevertheless , the appeal of the continuum formulation is undeniable . by representing nodal quasiparticles as massless dirac fermions",
    "one is hoping that their interactions with vortices can be described by a relatively simple and elegant effective continuum theory which can then become the starting point for analytic exploration of more complex problems involving fluctuating or disordered vortices , thermal and quantum fluctuations of vortex - antivortex pairs , etc .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to understand the source of difficulties besetting the continuum description of the linearized model and to overcome them@xcite .",
    "moreover , as pointed in the introduction , a detailed structure of vortex cores in cuprates is unknown at present and all possible tight - binding approaches will necessarily suffer from being dependent on short - range physics details , which , as one suspects , should have only a limited effect on the nodal quasiparticle wavefunctions in the bulk and thus on any effective low - energy theory .",
    "the linearized theory , in contrast , is formulated in terms of a universal hamiltonian ( [ h_ft ] ) , which is completely independent of short - range details , including the structure of vortex cores .",
    "the origin of the difficulties with different choices of ft singular gauge can be traced back to the assumptions made during the linearization procedure outlined above eq .",
    "( [ h_ft ] ) .",
    "although the conditions necessary for linearization are well satisfied for weak magnetic fields and in the bulk , far away from vortex cores ( @xmath93 ) , they are violated at distances @xmath94 , since the neglected terms diverge as @xmath95 near vortices .",
    "thus one suspects that additional regularization might be required to take into account the effect of such terms .",
    "let us nevertheless assume for a moment that the dependence on a - b arrangement _ is _ caused by a numerical procedure .",
    "since the scalar and vector potentials @xmath80 and @xmath10 diverge as @xmath85 as one approaches a vortex , one naturally expects that by finding the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunction near vortices , one can use it to his / her advantage to cure the singularities .",
    "the asymptotics in fact were found analytically by melnikov @xcite .",
    "for brevity , in this article we will consider mostly the isotropic case @xmath96 ; the results are easily generalized to the anisotropic case .    close to a vortex",
    "two linearly independent solutions of the eigenvalue problem for the linearized hamiltonian @xmath79 are described by the wavefunctions that diverge near the vortex as @xmath97 .",
    "the angular dependence of the divergent part of the wavefunctions @xmath98 near vortex a is described by @xmath99 where @xmath100 ( not to be confused with @xmath101 , the phase of the gap function ) is the polar angle around a particular vortex .",
    "the above is only the dominant part of each eigenfunction as @xmath102 ; the prefactors of this diverging term as well as subdominant terms are different for different eigenfunctions .",
    "generally , the weight of the divergent term in an eigenfunction decreases as its energy eigenvalue increases .",
    "the angular dependence of the singular part of the wavefunctions near vortices of b sublattice @xmath103 is given by an expression similar to ( [ asympta ] ) : @xmath104 the asymptotics above can be checked by retaining only the divergent parts of the potentials @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the ft equations with the radial dependence proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "such `` zeroth - order '' approximation describes a single vortex , since both the superfluid velocity and the vector potential can be represented as a sum ( see eq .",
    "( [ zetadef2 ] ) of the appendix ) .",
    "each term of the sum represents contribution of an individual vortex , and by neglecting all terms of the sum that are finite only the contribution of a single vortex is taken into account .",
    "then , one can easily verify that ( [ asympta ] ) or ( [ asymptb ] ) , for a vortex belonging to class a or b respectively , are exact eigenfunctions corresponding to zero energy .",
    "returning now to the lattice problem , the non - singular part of the hamiltonian , @xmath107 , which is due to other vortices , can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "such finite terms do not modify the limiting small @xmath108 behavior of the zero energy eigenstates ( if there are any ) .",
    "moreover , under the action of perturbation @xmath109 , the nonzero energy eigenstates are mixed with the singular wavefunctions ( [ asympta ] ) or ( [ asymptb ] ) , and therefore are described by the same limiting behavior close to any particular vortex .    the eigenfunctions of @xmath79 obtained numerically by the plane wave expansion close to a vortex will be shown below ( see fig . [",
    "fig : figftthetas ] ) to have asymptotic behavior given by either ( [ asympta ] ) or ( [ asymptb ] ) for vortices belonging to sublattice a or b , respectively . additionally , the increase of the wavefunctions according to power law @xmath97 and angular dependence given above near vortices at distances @xmath110 has been explicitly verified @xcite for the solutions of bdg equations describing the tight - binding lattice @xmath0-wave superconductor@xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ asympta ] ) describes _ two linearly independent _ solutions _ both _ of which diverge as @xmath111 as one approaches the vortex . for non - singular potentials",
    "only one of the solutions would have been square - integrable , and the second solution would have to be discarded .",
    "thus , before one proceeds , one must decide whether such divergent solutions are permitted in the spectrum .",
    "this issue is not entirely new , and similar problems were encountered in the context of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "there , a dirac particle is considered in the field of a single dirac string carrying a fractional magnetic flux .",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the relevant case of a single half - integer flux : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the vector potential corresponding to the aharonov - bohm half - flux .",
    "the hamiltonian can be obtained from ( [ h_ft ] ) where the last term describing scalar potential is set to zero .",
    "after rotation @xmath114 , @xmath115 we obtain hamiltonian in the basis used in : @xmath116 the eigenstates of @xmath117 can be expressed through bessel functions as @xmath118~. \\label{gensol}\\ ] ] gerbert and jackiw noticed that for all angular channels except @xmath119 the square integrability requirement specifies which of the two independent solutions in ( [ gensol ] ) should be present . for @xmath119",
    ", however , there is an ambiguity as both solutions are square integrable , but divergent as @xmath111 at the origin .",
    "they found that keeping both wavefunctions in the spectrum results in an overcomplete basis , with such pathologies as imaginary eigenvalues of the hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "the requirement of continuity ( non - divergence ) of the wavefunctions at the origin is too strong and causes the loss of completeness in the angular momentum channel .",
