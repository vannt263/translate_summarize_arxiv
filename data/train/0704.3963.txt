    "rotating black holes are described by the kerr solution of general relativity @xcite .",
    "matter particles can perform stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane around these compact objects as long as the orbital radius is greater than the marginally stable orbit @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a locally non  rotating frame ( lnrf ) offers a fairly easy way for studying particle motions in the kerr geometry @xcite . in a sense , the observer s frame co  rotates with spacetime thereby cancelling frame  dragging effects as much as possible .",
    "recently , an unexpected behaviour of the radial dependence of the orbital lnrf velocity of test masses with a keplerian angular velocity distribution around a rapidly rotating , non  charged black hole has been discovered @xcite : in vacuum spacetime of very fast spinning kerr black holes with the rotational parameter @xmath0 , there occurs an unexpected dip of the orbital lnrf velocity as function of orbital radius .",
    "this minimum  maximum structure of the orbital velocity emerges close to the black hole , at radii @xmath1 .",
    "orbital radii are given in units of the gravitational radius that is defined as @xmath2 with newton s constant g , vacuum speed of light c and black hole mass @xmath3 .",
    "we set g = c=@xmath3=1 throughout the paper for convenience .",
    "the gradient of the orbital velocity is positive in a small radial range .",
    "the radii associated with the local extrema are greater than the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and smaller than the last stable orbit at @xmath4 for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , this effect occurs always within the ergosphere of a kerr black hole .",
    "the velocity difference between the extrema , i.e.  the slow down amounts approximately to 1% of c at thorne s spin limit @xmath6 @xcite but is higher for larger black hole spin .",
    "the non  monotonic behaviour of the orbital lnrf velocity is a pure effect of general relativity and has been overlooked up to 2004 .",
    "a follow  up investigation has shown that the non  monotonic behaviour remains even for non  keplerian distributions of angular momentum ( @xmath7 ) in the kerr vacuum @xcite .",
    "the critical value of the black hole spin that guarantees the emergence of the effect is higher in this case , i.e.  @xmath8 .",
    "the motivation for this work is the question whether the non  monotonicity occurs also in more general kerr spacetimes or might actually been removed . in the present work ,",
    "the lnrf orbital velocity is generalized for kerr  de sitter and kerr  anti  de sitter spacetimes , i.e.  including the cosmological constant @xmath9 . as for the kerr spacetime",
    "proper , we use the boyer ",
    "lindquist form @xcite to study the motion of a particle .",
    "then , the line element of the ordinary kerr geometry holds @xmath10 with the functions ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath3 and @xmath5 denote black hole mass and spin , respectively .",
    "the line element for the kerr ",
    "de sitter ( kds , @xmath13 ) or kerr  anti  de sitter ( kads , @xmath14 ) metric , respectively , is significantly more complicated @xcite @xmath15 ^ 2 + \\rho^2\\,\\left(\\frac{dr^2}{\\delta_r}+\\frac{d\\theta^{2}}{\\delta_\\theta}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have the generalized functions @xmath16 @xmath9 denotes the cosmological constant .",
    "these functions reduce to the ordinary kerr geometry by setting @xmath17 : @xmath18 now , we aim to cast the kds / kads line element into a form analogous to equation  ( [ eq : kerr ] ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the generalizations of the functions @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "lindquist form @xcite , it is interesting to investigate its generalization , @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath26 is larger for increasing values of the cosmological constant , i.e.  the frame  dragging effect becomes stronger with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "further , it is even possible to reverse frame  dragging with a sufficiently low and negative @xmath9 . in this case , the radial position where the reversion takes place is determined by the root of @xmath26 .    with these generalizations",
    "it is straightforward to compute the orbital velocity component relative to the lnrf for kerr spacetimes with non ",

    "both distributions are motivated by astrophysical situations .",
    "keplerian angular momentum distributions can be found in accretion flows described by the standard disc model @xcite .",
    "torus solutions exhibit constant angular momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "the non  monotonic orbital velocity profile has originally been discovered for prograde orbits .",
    "a similar effect has not been found by us for retrograde orbits .",
    "hence we assume a prograde ( @xmath29 ) keplerian angular velocity distribution of the orbiting test particles that satisfies @xmath30 we can compute the velocity profile from equation  ( [ eq : velkds ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  1 which demonstrates that the minimum ",
    "maximum structure depends on @xmath9 . as visible in the plot , a cosmological constant close to zero self ",
    "consistently approaches the ordinary case for the kerr geometry .",
    "further , the strength of the slow ",

    "orbital lnrf velocity profiles around a black hole with @xmath33 for keplerian orbits in the equatorial plane ( @xmath34 ) and different values of the cosmological constant , @xmath35 . the orbital velocity is given in units of c ( @xmath36).,width=302 ]      particles around black holes may not follow keplerian orbits but show some distribution of the specific angular momentum @xmath37 , e.g.  @xmath7 . in this case , the general expression for the angular velocity in the kerr geometry can be specified for the kerr(anti)de sitter geometry @xmath38 the specific angular momentum @xmath37 has to be chosen in a range between marginally stable and marginally bound orbits , i.e.  @xmath39 , see @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath37 in this interval again reveals distinct minimum ",
    "maximum structures in the velocity profile .",
    "figure  2 displays the velocity profile computed from equations  ( [ eq : velkds ] ) and ( [ eq : genomeg ] ) for a kerr black hole with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in figure",
    "2 the values for @xmath5 and @xmath37 are chosen as an example and to make our work comparable to the work of @xcite . for @xmath42 their result is confirmed ( solid curve ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath9 can be easily determined by comparing the profile s position relative to the case @xmath42 .",
    "similar to the keplerian distribution , the trend remains : a negative @xmath9 amplifies the slow  down effect .",

    "we have investigated this more deeply since the interaction seems to control the occurrence and modulation depth of the minimum  maximum structure .",

    "in general , the existence and the positions of extrema are controlled by @xmath5 and @xmath9 . with decreasing @xmath9 the slow ",
    "down effect is enhanced for fixed and sufficiently high black hole spin .",
    "a gradient with only one root has a point of inflexion in the velocity profile , whereas more roots yield minima and maxima of the slow ",
    "down structure . for each given @xmath9 , there exists a critical value of the black hole spin @xmath47 that is associated with a gradient vanishing at one specific radius . for spin values",
    "greater than @xmath47 , there exists a radial range where the gradient becomes positive . in the kerr vacuum ( @xmath42 ) , it is @xmath48 for keplerian orbiters .",
    "however , generalizing to non  zero @xmath9 it is even possible that a high value of @xmath9 is associated with a lower value of critical spin . a graphical analysis of the gradient for fixed @xmath9 delivers the critical spins @xmath47 beyond which the minimum  maximum structure appears . the critical spin @xmath47 scales linearly with @xmath9 for @xmath49 ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the study for ordinary kerr black holes by aschenbach @xcite is confirmed and generalized to cases with non  zero cosmological constant .",
    "unexpectedly , a similar linear correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath9 can be found for @xmath7 angular momentum distributions ( figure  4 ) .",
    "both the slope and the offset of @xmath5 for @xmath42 differ slightly .",
    "the critical spin grows more steeply and the offset is smaller for keplerian angular momentum distributions .",
    "further , the linear correlation is constrained to a narrow interval of the cosmological constant .",
    "we find in our analysis that the minimum ",
    "maximum structure appears only for @xmath50 .",
    "critical spin values as function of @xmath9 for keplerian angular momentum distribution .",
    "the limiting values for the black hole spin @xmath47 are plotted as function of @xmath9 for keplerian distributions of the specific angular momentum .",
    "there appears to be an almost positive linear correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath9 . for spins larger than @xmath47 the slow ",
    "down effect occurs .",

    "the limiting values for the black hole spin @xmath47 are plotted as function of @xmath9 for @xmath7 specific angular momentum distributions .",
    "similar to the keplerian case an positive linear correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath9 remains .",
    "the analysis of the orbital velocity profiles shows that the the minimum ",
    "maximum structure occurs only for @xmath50.,width=302 ]",
    "the slow  down effect occurs for rapidly spinning black holes , @xmath53 .",
    "both observations and theory suggest the existence of rapidly spinning black holes . rapid rotation of supermassive black holes is suggested by the observation of broad iron k x  ray lines @xcite , and by flares observed from the galactic centre black hole @xcite .",
    "black hole theory suggests that supermassive black holes are endowed with high angular momentum due to the black hole growth history @xcite .",
    "jet launching mechanisms such as the blandford ",
    "znajek process @xcite also involve rapidly spinning black holes .",
    "general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations support this idea because strong outflows are driven by poynting fluxes near black holes only for high spins @xcite .",
    "if the minimum  maximum structure around a fast spinning black hole could be detected , its radial profile constrains both black hole spin and @xmath9 .    if black hole mass and spin were known from observations , e.g.  from quasi ",
    "periodic oscillations , it might be possible to constrain the cosmological constant .",
    "but only extraordinarily high values of @xmath9 would produce a significant change in the feature as demonstrated in the numerical examples .",
    "the cosmic concordance model @xcite suggests that @xmath9 is by many orders of magnitudes too small to enforce a significant change in the minimum  maximum structure .",
    "currently , there is no hope to detect this for the kerr black hole candidates . on the other hand",
    ", we would like to stress that theory of dark energy physics is limited by a number of uncertainties allowing a plethora of models .",
    "the extremes include proposals advocating for a cosmological constant that was significantly higher in earlier cosmological epochs , e.g.  involving false vacua @xcite , or even that there is no need for a cosmological constant because density inhomogeneities drive a modification of cosmic expansion @xcite .",
    "another model involves a modification of 4d gravity @xcite .",
    "the new gr effect outlined here might be exploited to probe general relativity for the strong field case .",
    "it is currently hard to say whether this new effect has any practical implication for cosmological studies .",
    "we conclude that a very fast spinning black hole ( @xmath54 for @xmath14 or @xmath0 for @xmath13 ) causes a slow down of the orbital velocity at distances within two gravitational radii .",
    "closer to the rotating black hole the orbital velocity steeply increases again  just as expected from newtonian physics .",
    "it has been demonstrated in this paper that the gr slow ",
    "down effect survives as the kerr black hole is immersed into a @xmath9 fluid which is described by the kerr ",
    "de sitter or kerr  anti  de sitter solution .",
    "this is true for keplerian distributions of angular momenta as well as for distributions with constant angular momenta .",
    "the parameter study reveals a trend that the slow ",
    "down effect is more pronounced for negative values of @xmath9 in both cases , the keplerian and @xmath7 orbiters .",
    "the minimum ",
    "maximum structure occurs for black hole spins close to 1 and fairly high @xmath9 .",
    "this is a new gr effect in kerr(anti)de sitter spacetimes .",
