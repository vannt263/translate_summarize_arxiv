    "our interest is in quantum mechanical models consisting of _ only _ the grassmann matrices .",
    "ordinary integrals over grassmann matrices were studied extensively in @xcite . there , it was shown how the problem of grassmann matrix integrals at large @xmath10 , @xmath11 can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem for the composite @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 , which is effectively bosonic . unlike bosonic matrices",

    "the models of interest in our work can be viewed as multi - particle quantum mechanical models of fermions which can occupy a finite set of single particle states @xmath16 , labeled by the matrix indices .",
    "in particular the hilbert space is finite dimensional .",
    "fermionic multi - particle models often arise as lattice models in condensed matter physics , where there is typically an assumption about some sort of nearest - neighbour interaction between the fermions reflecting spatial locality .",
    "in contrast , the class of models of interest in our paper have no such notion of spatial locality .",

    "we then describe several features of the emergent bosonic matrix quantum mechanical systems .",
    "we focus on the case where @xmath18 is quartic in the grassmann matrices , but the techniques we develop can be used more generally .    as mentioned , our models have a finite dimensional hilbert space . in this sense",
    "they differ from many of the quantum mechanical models studied in the context of holography , such as the d0-brane quantum mechanics or @xmath25 super yang - mills , where the systems have an infinite space of states , even at finite @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "several proposals have been made throughout the literature suggesting that the holographic dual of a de sitter universe ( or at least its static patch ) is indeed a system with a finite dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",

    "the models studied in this work serve as toy models where this can be seen explicitly , and we can examine to what extent the bosonic effective degrees of freedom adequately capture the physics and when this description breaks down .    the first part of the paper provides a detailed study for the @xmath26 case , in which the degrees of freedom are organized as vectors .",

    "generally speaking there is no a priori reason for this to be the case in a quantum system , given that the spectrum is discrete and one can not continuously change the kinetic energy .",

    "due to the non - contractible thermal circle , we can only fix the gauge up to the holonomy around the thermal circle @xcite .",
    "the fadeev - popov procedure in doing so gives us the following action for the ( time independent upon gauge fixing ) eigenvalues of @xmath423 which we denote @xmath425:@xmath426 we have dropped an overall constant which we must later recover by computing the zero temperature entropy , which should vanish because the ground state is unique .",
    "we have yet to calculate the contribution to the action of the fundamental matter fields .",
    "we first expand them in a fourier expansion : @xmath427 thus we obtain the thermal eigenvalues : @xmath428 the determinant to be evaluated is given by @xmath429 .",
    "it is uv divergent .",
    "we regulate the logarithm of the determinant by taking two derivatives with respect to @xmath66 and integrating @xmath66 twice while setting the integration constants to zero .",

    "in this appendix we briefly mention a slight modification of the vector model considered in the main body of the text .",
    "the degrees of freedom are given by two sets of @xmath11 complex fermion spinors @xmath441 .",
    "we consider the following euclidean action : @xmath442 following the procedure outlined in the main text , we end up with an effective action for a bosonic three - vector @xmath122 : @xmath443 performing a small velocity expansion one realizes that the term linear in velocity in fact cancels .",
    "this is due to the relative sign in front of @xmath122 in the two functional determinants in ( [ seffmod ] ) .",
    "thus the leading term in the velocity expansion is : @xmath444 the reason for the cancellation is that this model has a hamiltonian given by the difference in angular momentum .",
    "the ground state is given by the configuration where the two angular momenta , whose operators are given by @xmath445 and @xmath446 , are anti - aligned . in the language of the charged particle on the two - sphere , it is as if we have added a positron on top of the electron , thus canceling the effect of the lorentz force , leaving an ordinary kinetic term for the bound neutral particle .",
    "the configuration space is still parameterized by the angles on a two - sphere .",
    "the mass of the neutral particle is twice that of the original one , explaining the @xmath447 as opposed to the @xmath448 in ( [ seffmodkin ] ) .",
    "as before , at large @xmath11 we have a controlled low velocity expansion . at high energies ,",
    "the two angular momenta can fluctuate independently and this simple picture is lost .",
    "a similar modification can be made for the matrix model .",
