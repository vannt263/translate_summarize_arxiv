    "the bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian , describing bosons hopping across the sites of a discrete structure and originally introduced to model liquid he in confined geometries , @xcite proves successful in capturing the essential physics of a wide range of condensed - matter systems .",
    "the best known examples are no doubt provided by josephson - junction arrays ( jja)@xcite and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) arrays , @xcite which are the subject of a huge amount of both theoretical and experimental ongoing investigations .",
    "the hallmark of such class of systems is the presence of a superfluid phase as opposed to a ( mott ) insulator phase.@xcite the theoretical studies hitherto carried out on such phase transition mostly focus on homogeneous ambient lattices , and provide well - established numerical and analytical techniques .",
    "homogeneous lattices are also the basis of the current experimental realizations of systems belonging to the bh class .",
    "this is at least partly due to present technical constraints .",
    "for instance the optical techniques used to fragment becs yield quite naturally homogeneous arrays .    however , the striking progress in experimental techniques suggests the realization of inhomogeneous networks to be at hand .",
    "actually , jjas can be engineered in nontrivial geometries with the only possible constraint of planarity . in this respect ,",
    "interesting geometry - driven effects are proposed in refs . , while the physics of a fractal jja is experimentally studied in ref . .",
    "as to bec arrays , two very promising approaches for realizing inhomogeneous topologies are provided by holographic optical traps @xcite and magnetic microtraps @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "ongoing efforts are aimed at reducing the spacing between individual microtraps , currently bound above a few @xmath0 m , in order to couple the condensates therein confined .",
    "the deep influence of topological inhomogeneities on thermodynamic properties of discrete boson systems is evidenced by the occurrence of unexpected features even in the absence of boson interaction . indeed",
    ", a finite - temperature bose - einstein condensation can take place despite the low dimensionality of the system .",
    "this is illustrated in refs .",
    "in the case of the square comb lattice , namely an array of linear chains ( fingers ) joined along a transverse direction ( backbone ) such as the one shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : mfpd ] .",
    "more precisely , inhomogeneity induces a _ hidden _ band in the single - particle energy spectrum which is ultimately responsible for condensation .    on the other hand , the rich zero - temperature phase diagram of the bh model ensues from the competition between the on - site repulsion and the kinetic energy of the boson gas . in the light of this",
    ", a natural question arises as to the influence of topology on the physics of interacting bosons . in this respect",
    "we mention that the effect of the inhomogeneity arising from the superposition of a local on - site potential on an otherwise regular lattice has been recently addressed .",
    "in particular , the existence of local mott domains induced by a parabolic confining potential has been evidenced for bec arrays in refs . while refs .",
    "analyze the phase diagram on superlattices .    here , we consider inhomogeneities of purely topological ( i.e. kinetic rather than potential ) origin , focusing on the emblematic case of comb lattices , where the larger connectivity of the backbone is expected to act as a catalyst for superfluidity .",
    "interestingly , the competition between kinetic and boson - interaction energy causes the occurrence of an intermediate domain in the bh phase diagram .",
    "the usual mott - insulator lobes are separated from the superfluid domain by a phase characterized by the localization of superfluidity in a narrow region surrounding the comb backbone , the rest of the structure exhibiting an unexpected insulator - like behavior .",

    "@xcite features an exponential decrease with increasing distance from the backbone .",

    "the presence of _ confined superfluidity _ is first evidenced within a mean - field approach , and further confirmed by both a third order analytical strong coupling perturbative expansion ( scpe ) and ( population ) quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
