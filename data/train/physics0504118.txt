    "recently , brownian ratchets ( motors ) have attracted considered attention simulated by research on molecular motors @xcite . a brownian ratchet , which appeared in feynman s famous textbook for the first time as a thermal ratchet @xcite , is a machine which can rectify thermal fluctuation and produce a directed current .",
    "these subjects are motivated by the challenge to understand molecular motors@xcite , nanoscale friction@xcite , surface smoothening @xcite , coupled josephson junctions @xcite , optical ratchets and directed motion of laser cooled atoms @xcite , and mass separation and trapping schemes at the microscale@xcite .",
    "the brownian ratchet are spatially asymmetric but periodic structure in which transport of brownian particles is induced by some nonequilibrium processes @xcite , such as external modulation of the underling potential or a nonequilibrium chemical reaction coupled to a change of the potential , or contact with reservoirs at different temperatures .",
    "the most intensively studied quantity has been on the velocity of the transport particle . however , another important quantity is efficiency of energy conversion characteristic the operation of the system when the transported particle does work .",
    "how efficiency can brownian ratchets work ?",
    "this question is important not only for the construction of theory of molecular motors @xcite but also for foundation of non - equilibrium statistical physics . like carnot cycle ,",
    "brownian heat engine can extract work from the temperature difference of the heat baths , where brownian working material operates as a transducer of thermal energy into work .",
    "the study of the energetics of brownian ratchets is relevant for several reasons @xcite .",
    "firstly , highly efficient motors are desirable in order to decrease the energy consumption or to decrease the heat dissipation . secondly , brownian motors are related to fundamental problems of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , such as the maxwell demon and the trade - off between entropy and information .",
    "thirdly , many models proposed in the literature are based on nonequilibrium fluctuations without specifying their source . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the energetics of such models required a more precise formulation , since one has to determine the physical nature of the external agent and verify that the motor is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "recently , sekimoto has been unambiguously defined the concept of the heat at mesoscopic scales in terms of langevin equation @xcite .",
    "he refers to the formalism providing this definition as stochastic energetics .",
    "the essential point of this formalism is that the heat transferred to the system is nothing but the microscopic work done by both friction force and the random force in the langevin equation .",
    "stochastic energetics has been applied to the study of thermodynamic processes .",
    "derenyi and astumian @xcite have studied the efficiency of one - dimensional thermally driven brownian engines .",
    "they identify and compare the three basic setups characterized by the type of the connection between the brownian particle and the two reservoirs : ( 1 ) simultaneous @xcite , ( 2 ) alternating in time @xcite , and ( 3)position dependent @xcite .",
    "parrondo and cisneros @xcite has reviewed the literature the energetics of brownian motors , distinguishing between forced ratchet , chemical motors - driven out of equilibrium by difference of chemical potential , and thermal motors - driven by temperature differences . in this paper we give a detailed study of the last motors - thermal motors .",
    "energetics of the thermal motors - driven by temperature differences are investigated by some previous works @xcite .",
    "asfaw @xciteet al . have explored the performance of the motors under various conditions of practical interest such as maximum power and optimized efficiency .",
    "they found that the efficiency can approach the carnot efficiency under the quasistatic limit .",
    "the same results are also obtained in matsuo and sasa s work @xcite by stochastic energetics theory .",
    "the previous works are limited to case of heat flow via potential .",
    "the present work extends the study to case of heat flow via both potential and kinetics energy .",
    "the motor can work as a heat engine or a refrigerator under various conditions .",
    "the efficiency of heat engine ( cop of refrigerator ) is different from the results of previous works and can never approach the carnot efficiency ( cop ) .",
    "the heat flow via potential is reversible when the engine works at quasistatic limit .",
    "the heat flow via the kinetic is always irreversible in nature .",
    "the model ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) consists of brownian particles moving in a sawtooth potential with an external load where the medium is alternately in contact with hot and cold heat reservoirs along the space coordinate .",
    "let @xmath0 be the barrier height of the potential .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 are the length of the left part and the right part of the ratchet , respectively . @xmath3 is the energy needed for a forward jump , while @xmath4 is the energy required for a backward jump",
    ". the left part of a period ratchet is at temperature @xmath5 ( hot reservoir)and the right one is at temperature @xmath6 ( cold reservoir ) .",
    "we can assumes that the rates of both forward and backward jumps are proportional to the corresponding arrhenius factor @xcite , such that    , @xmath7 is a piecewise linear and periodic potential .",
    "@xmath8 is a potential due to the load .",

    "<S> we study the energestics of a thermal motor driven by temperature differences , which consists of brownian particles moving in a sawtooth potential with an external load where the viscous medium is alternately in contact with hot and cold heat reservoir along space coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the motor can work as a heat engine or a refrigerator under different conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the heat flow via both potential and kinetic energy are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the former is reversible when the engine works quasistatically and the latter is always irreversible . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the heat engine ( coefficient of performance ( cop ) of a refrigerator ) can never approach carnot efficiency ( cop ) . </S>"
