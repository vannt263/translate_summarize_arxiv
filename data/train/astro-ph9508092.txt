    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) continue to confound astrophysicists nearly a quarter century after their discovery @xcite . before the launch of cgro , most scientists thought that grbs came from magnetic neutron stars residing in a thick disk ( having a scale height of up to @xmath0 2 kpc ) in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the data gathered by batse showed the existence of a rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution of grbs and that the sky distribution of even faint grbs is consistent with isotropy @xcite .",
    "this rules out a thick galactic disk source population , with @xcite or without @xcite spiral arms .",
    "consequently , the primary impact of the batse results has been to intensify debate about whether the bursts are galactic or cosmological in origin .",
    "galactic models attribute the bursts primarily to high - velocity neutron stars in a galactic corona , which must extend one sixth or more of the distance to andromeda ( @xmath1 kpc ) in order to avoid any discernible anisotropy @xcite .",
    "cosmological models place the grb sources at distances @xmath2 gpc , corresponding to redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "a source population at such large distances naturally produces an isotropic distribution of bursts on the sky , and the expansion of the universe or source evolution can reproduce the observed rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution @xcite .    within the context of this workshop , we focus on galactic corona models involving high velocity neutron stars . a recent discussion of cosmological models may be found in , e.g. , blaes @xcite .",
    "only a few years ago scientists thought that neutron stars had velocities of 100 - 200 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "but recent studies show @xcite that as much as 50% of neutron stars have velocities @xmath5 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these velocities are so high that these neutron stars escape from the galaxy and produce a distant , previously unknown galactic `` corona . ''",
    "the evidence that many neutron stars have high velocities comes from two independent directions . in the first case",
    ", long - wavelength radio observations have discovered that many young radio pulsars are associated with young ( @xmath6 yrs ) supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "sometimes the young pulsar lies within the shell - like supernova remnant ; sometimes it is passing through the shell , as the spectacular radio image of the `` duck '' supernova remnant and pulsar psr1757 - 24 reveals ; and sometimes the young pulsar is associated only with a comet - like `` plerion , '' or filled remnant . in every case",
    "the pulsar lies far from the center of the remnant .",
    "these offsets imply median transverse velocities",
    "@xmath7 km s@xmath4 , with @xmath0 1/3 of the neutron stars having transverse velocities @xmath8 km s@xmath4 @xcite .    in the second case , a new model for the electron density in the milky way and a greater understanding of an important observational bias that affects the determination of pulsar velocities",
    "has dramatically increased the velocities inferred for older pulsars .",
    "the new electron density model shows that the distance to , and therefore the transverse velocity of , nearby pulsars was underestimated by about a factor of two in previous models @xcite .",
    "the observational bias that affects the determination of pulsar velocities arises because young radio pulsars are born close to the galactic plane , and move rapidly away from it if their velocity is high . after some time , the pulsars that remain within detectable range are mostly those with small velocities .",
    "the strength of the bias is illustrated by the fact that the mean of the distribution of transverse velocities is @xmath9 km s@xmath4 for pulsars with spindown ages @xmath10 3 myr , whereas it is @xmath11 km s@xmath4 for pulsars with @xmath12 70 myr @xcite .",
    "recent studies that incorporate these discoveries yield median neutron star total velocities @xmath13 km s@xmath4 , with as many as half of all neutron stars having velocities",
    "@xmath5 km s@xmath4 @xcite . these results have revolutionized our understanding of the spatial distribution of neutron stars in the galaxy .",
    "since the escape velocity from the milky way is @xmath14 km",
    "s@xmath4 in the solar neighborhood and @xmath15 km s@xmath4 in the galactic bulge , where most neutron stars are born , all of these high velocity neutron stars will escape from the milky way .",
    "they form a distant , previously unknown `` corona '' around the milky way .",
    "this distant corona contains an ample population of sources which appear isotropic when viewed from the earth .",
    "prior to the launch of cgro , many scientists believed it likely that gamma - ray bursts came from a thick galactic disk .",
    "but , while a galactic disk population was the most conservative and perhaps the most popular model @xcite , extended halo populations have also had a long and illustrious history ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "what did exist was a consensus that gamma - ray bursts come from magnetic neutron stars in the galaxy .",
    "there were many reasons for this , several of which we describe below .",
    "following the discovery by batse that the faint bursts are distributed isotropically on the sky , galactic halo and corona models found new flavor ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as an attractive way of reconciling all of the evidence about grbs which favors galactic neutron stars with isotropy .",
    "however , these models were considered somewhat ad hoc , particularly by advocates of cosmological models , because no means of producing large numbers of neutron stars in an extended galactic halo was known [ see , e.g. @xcite ] . .",
    "consequently , the debate about whether grbs are galactic or cosmological in origin was characterized as one between those who advocated objects which we know produce burst - like phenomena ( high velocity neutron stars ; see below ) but which were not known to have the necessary spatial distribution ( extended galactic halo ) _",
    "vs. _ those who advocated objects which we do not know can produce burst - like phenomena ( e.g. , coalescing neutron star binaries or failed supernovae ) but were known to have the necessary spatial distribution ( cosmological ) .",
    "the subsequent discovery that many neutron stars have velocities high enough to escape from the milky way has given models a tremendous boost .",
    "nevertheless , these models must answer several important questions :    * can a galactic corona of high velocity neutron stars account for the isotropic sky distribution and the rollover in the brightness distribution of grbs seen by batse ?",
    "* why do only high velocity neutron stars produce grbs ? * are grbs beamed along the direction of motion of the neutron star or , if not , why is bursting activity delayed ? * are there energy sources sufficient to power grbs in such a model ? * can the energy needed be released over 500 myr or more ? * can cyclotron lines formed in regions where the magnetic field is @xmath16 g be produced by magnetic neutron stars in grbs with luminosities @xmath17 erg s@xmath4 ?    we consider each of these questions below .",

    "our discussion of pair fireballs follows that of mszros @xcite .",
    "a compactness parameter @xmath18 is required for photons to be observed above an energy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the radius of the source and @xmath21 measures the relativistic velocity . for @xmath22 , @xmath23 at @xmath24 mev unless @xmath25 .",
    "this result suggests that the initial stages of pair fireball in a gamma - ray burst is optically thick .",
    "if so , we expect that the sudden release of the energy that powers the burst will produce a trapped fireball in the region of closed magnetic fields lines in the neutron star magnetosphere and a mildly relativistic wind from the regions of open field lines at the magnetic poles ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this picture is similar in many respects to the soft gamma - ray repeater model of thompson and duncan @xcite .",
    "the energy required in a solid angle @xmath26 is @xmath27    pair production occurs if @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lab frame target photon energy and @xmath30 is the relative angle between the two photons .",
    "causality implies @xmath31 , or @xmath32 and @xmath33 this implies relativistic expansion and therefore beaming .",
    "how large might @xmath21 be ?",
    "in agn , an initial value ( near the central source ) as large as @xmath34 is often assumed . if the wind is powered by compton scattering , a value @xmath35 or so is expected .",
    "if @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the amount of baryonic matter entrained in the outflow , then the wind will be subrelativistic due to baryonic poisoning .",
    "almost fifteen years ago mazets et al .",
    "@xcite reported seeing single lines in the spectra of grbs at low energies ( @xmath38 kev ) .",
    "later hueter @xcite reported single lines at low energies in the spectra of two bursts seen by heao-1 a4 .",
    "however , the statistical significance of the lines was modest .",
    "more recently , equally - spaced lines were seen by _ ginga _ in the spectra of three bursts @xcite with high significance @xcite .",
    "the line features in these three bursts have been studied extensively , and there is no doubt that they exist .",
    "lines have not been definitively seen by batse @xcite , but this fact does not strongly contradict earlier observations @xcite .",
    "similar line features are seen in the spectra of accretion - powered pulsars@xcite , which are known to be magnetic neutron stars .",
    "the equally - spaced lines seen in grbs and in accretion - powered pulsars are easily explained in terms of cyclotron resonant scattering in a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "magnetic neutron stars in the galactic corona appear able to produce cyclotron lines even though the luminosities of the bursts might greatly exceed the so - called eddington luminosity at which radiation pressure and gravity balance .",
    "cyclotron lines may form , for example , in a relativistic wind flowing out from the magnetic poles of the neutron star @xcite , or at the magnetic equator @xcite where hot plasma is trapped by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "detailed dynamical calculations show that a distant galactic corona of high velocity neutron stars can easily account for the isotropic angular distribution and the brightness distribution of grbs . gravitational potential energy from accretion and magnetic field energy",
    "seem the most promising sources of energy which are capable of powering bursts from such a population of neutron stars .",
    "* sky distribution .",
    "* our ability to detect or place upper limits on any anisotropies in the burst sky distribution , especially as a function of burst brightness , will increase slowly but steadily as batse detects more bursts .",
    "confirmation of significant galactic dipole and/or quadrupole moments as a function of burst brightness , or overall , would provide definitive evidence that the bursts are galactic .",
    "further limits on any angular anisotropy will constrain , and might rule out , the galactic hypothesis . however , the limits that batse will be able to achieve are not likely to be definitive , since the angular distribution of bursts from the distant galactic corona can be very isotropic .",
    "detection of a concentration of bursts toward andromeda , either by batse , or by a more sensitive experiment would constitute definitive evidence that the bursts are galactic in origin .",
    "lack of an excess toward andromeda would be compelling evidence that the bursts are cosmological in origin only if made by an instrument at least 50 times more sensitive than batse , given the possibility that the bursts are beamed along the direction of motion of the neutron star and current constraints on the galactic corona model    * cyclotron lines .",
    "* other spectroscopy instruments are now operating ( tgrs and konus on wind ) or will soon be flown ( e.g. , hete , konus on spectrum x - gamma , etc . ) which will search for lines .",
    "further confirmation of the existence of cyclotron lines would provide strong evidence in favor of the galactic hypothesis .",
    "* repeating*. the new bursts in the third batse catalog are not expected to suffer from the same limitations which afflicted bursts in the second year of observations due to failure of the tape recorders on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory_. it is therefore expected that the third batse catalogue will provide an excellent opportunity to test the repeating hypothesis .",
    "confirmation of repeating would doom most cosmological models .",
