    "a long time ago , kobes and semenoff ( ks in the following ) presented in a series of two papers a generalization of the well known cutkosky s rules in order to calculate the imaginary part of a green s function in the real time formalism ( rtf ) at finite temperature . in the first paper @xcite , they generalized in a straightforward way the rules valid at zero temperature for each term of the sum over the type @xmath2 or @xmath3 for the internal vertices of the diagram .",
    "this first step resulted in a huge number of terms to be evaluated in order to calculate the imaginary part of a diagram at finite temperature . in their second paper @xcite , they focused on thermal green s functions whose external points are all of type @xmath2 , because in these days it was strongly believed that the type @xmath2 fields were  physical \" , whereas the type @xmath3 fields were supposed to be  ghost fields \" that could not appear on the external lines of a physical amplitude . for this kind of green s functions ,",
    "the rules obtained in their first paper can be simplified considerably , but their conclusion is that the standard interpretation of these rules in terms of cut diagrams do not survive the thermalization .",
    "navely , the reason of that difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath4 cases lies in the fact that at @xmath1 , a cut propagator , proportional to @xmath5 , imposes a definite sign to the energy flow , whereas at @xmath6 , it is proportional to @xmath7 so that the energy flow is not constrained any longer .",
    "recently , bedaque , das and naik ( bdn ) claimed @xcite that the interpretation in terms of cut diagrams holds also at finite temperature , despite the apparent lack of energy flow constraints in the high temperature cut propagators .",
    "their proof is essentially based on the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) identities verified by the high temperature green s functions , which imply a cancelation of the terms that do not correspond to a cut trough the diagram when performing the sum over the types @xmath2 or @xmath3 of the internal vertices .",
    "it is also obvious that such a cancelation is quite impossible in ks s rules , since this sum is already performed by these rules .",
    "moreover , a lot of actual calculations have been carried with the rules of ks , and contradictions with the results provided by other methods , like calculating the whole diagram and then taking the imaginary part or calculating the same quantity in the imaginary time formalism , have never been found , indicating that ks s rules should be true despite their lack of interpretation in terms of cut diagrams .",
    "nevertheless , bdn never explained in their paper the reason of the discrepancy between their result and ks s result .",
    "for these reasons , it seems useful to investigate the precise connections between the two approaches , in order to explain carefully the origin of their apparent discrepancy .",
    "this is the purpose of the section [ form12 ] .",
    "the outline of that section is as follows : first , we recall the common starting point of both methods , which is a direct generalization of the @xmath1 cutkosky s rules . then , we reproduce the derivation of ks s rules , explaining how terms that does not correspond to cut diagrams arise , and why they are necessary in this approach . in the paragraph",
    "[ bdnform ] , we expose an abbreviated version of bdn s proof , leading to a set of cutting rules in which every term is interpretable as a cut diagram .",
    "finally , we explain where the apparent contradiction lies and compare the efficiency of both methods on an explicit example .    the section [ other ] is devoted to the presentation of the cutting rules that must be used in other versions of the real - time formalism .",
    "indeed , aurenche and becherrawy @xcite , followed by van eijck and van weert @xcite , first presented a new set of feynman rules that can be obtained trough a  rotation \" applied to the usual  1/2 \" formalism .",
    "the aim of that transformation is to obtain a matrix propagator with two vanishing components , and without statistical factors .",
    "the statistical weights are then rejected into the vertices .",
    "the two non - vanishing components are nothing but the retarded and advanced zero - temperature propagators , which is at the origin of the denomination of this formalism as  retarded / advanced \" ( r / a ) formalism .",
    "then , van eijck , kobes and van weert generalized that kind of transformations in @xcite .",
    "r / a \" formalism appeared to be only a particular example of this kind of transformations .",
    "in particular , two other formulations of the rtf appeared to be quite simple : the keldysh formalism which is useful in problems related to the linear response theory , and the  feynman / anti feynman \" ( @xmath8/@xmath9 ) formalism which have also only two non - vanishing propagator components , which are the usual zero - temperature feynman propagator and its complex conjugate .",
    "the  r / a \" formalism then proved to be quite efficient for carrying actual calculations @xcite , and to have very close connections with the imaginary time formalism @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why it would be very useful to have some rules enabling one to calculate the imaginary part of a green s function directly in the  r / a \" formalism , and more generally in all the formalisms of @xcite .",
    "this will be done quite simply in the section [ other ] , first in the case of general transformations for which the  rotation \" matrix is real , and then in the particular cases that correspond to the three formalisms evocated above .",
    "the  r / a \" cutting rules appear to be very simple , and lead to quite compact calculations .",
    "some emphasis will be put in the calculation of the imaginary part of self - energy diagrams , since this quantity is related to the decay rate and production rate of the external particle . in that particular case ,",
    "the  r / a \" cutting rules become even more simple .",
    "finally , section [ concl ] is devoted to a summary and to concluding remarks .",
    "we follow here the method which has been derived first by ks in @xcite . in the @xmath0 formalism , every green s function with external points of types @xmath10 can be formally written as the sum over the types @xmath2 or @xmath3 of the internal vertices @xmath11-point green functions are defined to be entering .",
    "the only exeption to this rule is the @xmath3-point functions for which we do nt write explicitly the two momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 since they are related simply by @xmath14 .",
    "the single momentum indicated as the argument of @xmath3-point functions is the one which enters by the leg corresponding to the first label . ] : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the term with external points of fixed type @xmath17 and internal vertices of type @xmath11 .",
    "then , taking the imaginary part : @xmath18 the first step towards the rules enabling to perform directly the calculation of this imaginary part is common to both ks and bdn approaches .",
    "it consists essentially in reproducing what is done at @xmath1 for each term of the sum of eq .",
    "( [ sum1 ] ) and is based on the largest time equation . following @xcite ,",
    "we are led to introduce two kind of vertices ; the usual ones @xmath19 and a set of  circled \" vertices ( represented by a small circle in the figures , and with an underlined label in the equations ) @xmath20 which are nothing but the complex conjugates of the standard ones .",
    "of course , we need also all the propagators enabling one to connect every pair of vertices .",
    "the usual thermal propagator @xmath21 is the propagator connecting an uncircled vertex of type @xmath22 to an uncircled vertex of type @xmath23 , the momentum flow being @xmath24 in the direction @xmath25 : @xmath26 the explicit expressions of these propagators being ( for a contour parameter chosen to be @xmath27 ) for bosonic fields : @xmath28 the propagators @xmath29 connecting the circled vertex of type @xmath22 to the uncircled vertex of type @xmath23 and carrying the momentum @xmath24 are related to the standard ones by : @xmath30 with now obvious notations , we have also : @xmath31 and @xmath32 then , following @xcite , we obtain : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a sum running over all the possibilities of circling the points @xmath17 and @xmath11 , excepted the two terms where all or none of the points are circled , and @xmath35 is the corresponding term . in some sense , this formula is a simple generalization of the standard @xmath1 cutkosky s formula . the only difference lies of course in the fact that at @xmath1 , one can further simplify the calculation of the imaginary part since the energy flow constraints induced by the propagators connecting circled to uncircled vertices ( called  cut propagators \" in the following ) eliminates all the configurations of circles that do not correspond to a cut trough the diagram .",
    "as already mentioned , this appears to be impossible at high @xmath36 since the  cut propagators \" do not constrain the energy flow at non vanishing @xmath36 .",
    "adding now the sum over the types of the internal vertices , we get for the imaginary part of the complete green s function : @xmath37 this formula is the common starting point of ks and bdn approaches .",
    "it is important to notice that the number of terms to be evaluated in the right hand side of this equation is quite huge .",
    "indeed , not only the sum over the types @xmath2 or @xmath3 of all the internal vertices is to be performed , but also the sum over the possibilities of circling vertices , without excluding the circlings that do not correspond to a cut diagram .      at that point",
    ", ks managed in @xcite to get rid of the sum @xmath38 to obtain a simpler expression of the imaginary part in the case where all the external points are of type @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for such a choice was based on the common belief according to which the  physical fields \" were of type @xmath2 , whereas the type @xmath3 fields were  ghost fields \" .",
    "any physical amplitude therefore should have only type @xmath2 external points . nowadays",
    ", this interpretation of type @xmath2 or @xmath3 fields has been ruled out by the fact that it is not clear what a  physical amplitude \" at finite @xmath36 is ( for instance , the most physically relevant self - energy function is not @xmath39 but the function which appears in the pole shift , as can be seen by performing a dyson summation ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of self - energies , the imaginary part of the relevant self - energy is related to the imaginary part of @xmath39 in a simple way ( see @xcite ) , so that the calculation of @xmath40 is sufficient .    in their final formula , there are only type @xmath2 external points and internal vertices : @xmath41}}^ { } g^{(\\{a_i=1\\}),[\\{v_i=1\\}]}(\\{k_i\\})\\ ; , \\label{ksfor}\\ ] ] where the sum @xmath42}}$ ] runs over all the possibilities of circling the external points @xmath17 excepted the two terms where all or none of them are circled , and _ all _ the possibilities of circling the internal vertices @xmath11 . the important advantage compared to eq .",
    "( [ common ] ) lies in the fact that the sum over the type of the internal vertices is already performed , which reduces drastically the number of terms to be evaluated . a very simple proof of that formula can also be found in @xcite .",
    "this formula leads to some difficulties in its interpretation since it generates some terms that does not correspond to cuts through the diagram , _",
    "i.e. _ to topologies where the  cut propagators \" ( propagators connecting a circled to an uncircled vertex ) do not divide the diagram in two connected parts .",
    "two examples of such a contributions are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ uncut ] .",
    "one should note that in this approach , there is a complete equivalence between the cut propagators and the  on - shell \" propagators , _",
    "i.e. _ propagators that are proportional to a factor @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , it should be emphazised that these  uncut terms \" are necessary in this formula in order to have the cancelation of the pathologies consisting in products of distributions having overlapping supports , like @xmath44 or @xmath45 : without these terms , the result would be ill - defined .",
    "this is what happens for the first example of fig .",
    "[ uncut ] .",
    "but , it would not be consistent to simply drop these  uncut terms \" , by arguing that they are here only for the cancelation of pathologies , because that these  uncut terms \" can occur even when there are no pathologies to be canceled , like in the second diagram of fig .",
    "[ uncut ] .",
    "so , the conclusion of this approach is that despite a considerable reduction of the number of terms , the formula eq .",
    "( [ ksfor ] ) generates unavoidably a few terms that are not interpretable in terms of cut diagrams , these terms being absolutely necessary for the completeness of the result .",
    "after formula ( [ common ] ) , bdn took an orthogonal way compared to ks , since they chose to reduce the number of terms contained in that formula by trying to simplify the sum @xmath34 while keeping the sum @xmath38 unchanged . in their approach",
    ", there is no need of a special assumption concerning the type @xmath2 or @xmath3 of the external points of the diagram .",
    "in fact , they proved that the effect of the sum @xmath38 was to kill all the configurations of circlings that do not correspond to cut diagrams , a cut diagram being generically of the type depicted in fig .",
    "[ cut ] . of course , in the remaining terms",
    ", the sum @xmath38 is still to be performed .    in what follows",
    ", we give a simple proof of that result .",
    "let us first notice that it is enough to prove that the configurations where a set of uncircled vertices is completely surrounded by circled vertices only ( and vice versa ) are killed by the sum over the type of the @xmath11 s .",
    "these configurations occur when the disposition of the circles in the diagram is such that the diagram contains a subdiagram of one of the types depicted in fig .",
    "[ cancelled ] . in the figure  [ cancelled ] ,",
    "the vertices labeled by @xmath46 are obviously internal , so that we must sum over the types @xmath47 .",
    "it is this sum that will make these configurations vanish .",
    "let us begin by the configuration of fig .",
    "[ cancelled]-(a ) .",
    "the corresponding terms in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ common ] ) are proportional to the quantity : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath50-point vertex function with external points @xmath46 and entering momenta @xmath51 ( the signs associated to type @xmath52 external vertices are included in its definition ) . looking at the propagators connecting a circled vertex to an uncircled one in eq .",
    "( [ circuncirc ] ) , we obtain : @xmath53 since the @xmath50-point vertex functions satisfy the identity @xcite : @xmath54 this identity is in fact the fourier expression of the largest time equation used in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that this cancelation survives in an out - of - equilibrium field theory since this identity is always verified .",
    "considering now the configuration of fig .",
    "[ cancelled]-(b ) , the corresponding terms in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ common ] ) are proportional to : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath50-point vertex function made only of circled vertices .",
    "therefore , this vertex function is nothing but the complex conjugate of the previous one : @xmath57 making use of eq .",
    "( [ uncirccirc ] ) , we can write :    f^\\{b_i}(\\{k_i})&&=_\\{c_i=1,2 } ( ^\\{c_i}(\\{k_i}))^ * _ \\{i|c_i=1 } g^21(k_i ) _ \\{i|c_i=2 } g^12(k_i ) + & & = _ \\{c_i=1,2 } ( _ \\{i|c_i=2 } e^-k_i^0 ) ( ^\\{c_i}(\\{k_i}))^ * + & & = 0 ,    the last equality being a consequence of the identity @xcite : @xmath58 which is nothing but the expression of the kubo - martin - schwinger property for @xmath50-point real time vertex functions .",
    "this relation was used by @xcite in time coordinates where it appears to be related to the @xmath59 periodicity properties of green s functions .",
    "one can note that this cancelation is not true in an out - of - equilibrium plasma since it makes use of the kms relations which are specific to thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , taking these cancelations into account , we can reduce the sum @xmath34 over the disposition of circles to a smaller sum where we keep only those terms that correspond to a cut through the diagram , like on fig .",
    "we can then write : @xmath60 in that formula , the sum over the type @xmath2 or @xmath3 of the internal vertices @xmath11 is still to be performed for the remaining terms .",
    "this fact happens to generate more terms than with the final formula of kobes and semenoff .",
    "the issue of the efficiency of both methods will be discussed on an example in the next paragraph .",
    "one could then wonder why it is possible thanks to the kms relations to eliminate the same configurations of circles than at @xmath1 , despite the the fact that apparently these relations have nothing to do with energy flow constraints .",
    "in fact , the study of the @xmath1 limit of the kms relations of eq .",
    "( [ kms ] ) indicates that the kms identity appears to be a thermal generalization of some energy flow constraints .",
    "indeed , it is possible to show that a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ kms ] ) is : @xmath61 a proof of this relation is given in the appendix .",
    "so , even if this limit is not a proof of the fact that kms should play at positive @xmath36 the same role than energy flow constraints at @xmath1 , it points towards the interpretation of the kms identity as the thermal generalization of a very simple constraint on energy flow limit leads to a trivial proof of the fact that the real time  1/2 \" formalism goes into the standard @xmath1 feynman rules ( _ i.e. _ without the need of a matrix propagator ) when one is calculating a function with only type @xmath2 external points .",
    "indeed , when inserting a vertex function between @xmath50 legs , we have @xmath62 and we prove by induction that only type @xmath2 vertices are needed . ] .",
    "let us first explain where lies the apparent contradiction between the conclusions of ks and bdn concerning the issue of the interpretation in terms of cut diagrams :    * in eq .",
    "( [ ksfor ] ) , some terms are not interpretable as the contribution of a cut diagram .",
    "moreover , as already said , the uncut propagators can only be @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "it means that the uncut propagators are always off - shell ( _ i.e. _ not proportional to a dirac delta function ) . on the contrary ,",
    "all the cut propagators are on - shell . * in eq .",
    "( [ bdnfor ] ) , all the terms are interpretable as contributions of cut diagrams .",
    "moreover , with the same definition as in ks approach for a cut propagator ( _ i.e. _ connecting the circled vertices to the uncircled ones ) , the uncut propagators in this approach can be any of @xmath21 or @xmath65 . among them , we find @xmath66 and @xmath67 which are on - shell .",
    "this is an essential difference with the approach of ks .",
    "therefore , the expression  cut propagator \" does not cover the same reality in both approaches .",
    "some of the uncut propagators ( more precisely , those which are on - shell ) of bdn are considered to be cut ones in ks method .",
    "it means that more propagators are called  cut propagators \" in ks s approach than in bdn s one , and this is of course at the origin of the apparent discrepancy .",
    "navely speaking , if one has more  cut propagators \" , then it will be difficult to have only configurations where the set of cut propagators form a single cut through the diagram .",
    "this assertion is illustrated in the figure [ hidden ] , in which we see clearly how some of the cut propagators of ks , spoiling the interpretation of the imaginary part in terms of cut diagrams , are  hidden \" in the approach of bdn .",

    "this implies that we restrict ourselves to equilibrium theories since the kms identity is required to derive the spectral representation of green s functions .",

    " r / a \" formalism , we have : @xmath164 which leads to @xmath168      then , thanks to these relations and to the fact that the spectral function @xmath152 is the same in all the formalisms , we can relate the imaginary part of self - energies in various formalisms and choose the formalism that leads to the simplest calculations . in particular , we obtain for the imaginary part of the pole shift of the feynman propagator : @xmath169      practically , it appears that the  r / a \" formalism leads to very compact calculations for the imaginary part of self - energies . in particular , looking at the place of the vanishing terms in the  r / a \" matrix propagators , and using the concept of  @xmath170-flow \" introduced in @xcite , we can prove the following statements :    * the connected set of uncircled vertices must be linked to the external leg on which enters the retarded momentum . * the sum over the internal indices @xmath171 or @xmath172 contains a single non vanishing term if the cut goes through all the loops of the diagram ( _ i.e. _ the configuration of the internal @xmath171 or @xmath172 indices is totally constrained by such a cut ) . *",
    "if the cut is more general and keeps some loops uncut , it divides the diagram in two amplitudes , one of them being of the @xmath173 type while the other one is the complex conjugate of a @xmath174 amplitude .",
    "this is another proof of a result contained in @xcite .",
    "moreover , these amplitudes are quite simple analytic continuations from the imaginary time formalism .",

    ", one can say that the  r / a \" formalism appears to be quite simple to calculate imaginary parts of self - energies , because of the presence of many vanishing components in the propagators of this formalism . moreover , the fact that it gives expressions in which the statistical weights are factorized in the vertices proves to be very helpful to clarify the calculations .",
    "r / a \" formalism seems to be the only one for which bdn s formula is more efficient than the  1/2 \" formalism used with the ks rules .",
    "for instance , in the case of the example already considered on fig .",
    "[ ks ] , bdn s formula in association with the  r / a \" formalism leads to three terms , to be compared with the eight ( only four in practice , since they can be combined by pairs differing only by a simple factor ) terms generated by the method of ks .",
    "the first result of this paper is to make a detailed comparison of two apparently contradictory approaches for the calculation of the imaginary part of thermal green s functions in the  1/2 \" real time formalism .",
    "it appeared that the two methods are in fact completely equivalent in the sense that they lead to the same result .",
    "moreover , despite the fact that bedaque , das and naik s method seems to lead to a more common interpretation of the imaginary part in terms of products of amplitudes , this interpretation is partly spoiled by the fact that the terms that would correspond to such an interpretation are in fact ill - defined when considered individually . from the point of view of the length of the calculations , the method of kobes and semenoff appeared to be much more efficient .",
    "the second part of the paper has been devoted to the generalization of the cutting rules already obtained in the  1/2 \" formalism , in order to give similar rules for other bases of the real time formalism .",
    "it appeared that such rules are in fact quite general , and that the result of bedaque , das and naik can be generalized to any new formalism , provided we restrict ourselves to equilibrium field theories . among these formalisms",
    ", the  retarded / advanced \" one appeared to be quite efficient for the calculation of the imaginary part of thermal green s functions , and even more in the case of self - energies .",
    "each time it was possible , we indicated how the formulas would change if one were dropping the kms relation , thereby enabling the possibility of an out - of - equilibrium system . here again , the  r / a \" formalism seems to be the simplest one .",
    "nevertheless , it should be emphazised that , at present date , the simple generalization of equilibrium feynman rules to a non - equilibrium situation based on the replacement of the bose - einstein statistical weight by an arbitrary function is not consistent , since the cancelation of the pathologic products of distributions does not work anymore .",
