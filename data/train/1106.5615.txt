    "study the two - user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) interference channel ( ic ) , consisting of two transmitter ( tx ) - receiver ( rx ) pairs ( or links ) .",
    "the transmissions are concurrent and cochannel ; hence , they interfere with each other .",
    "the txs employ multiple antennas and the rxs a single antenna .",
    "we assume that the channels are flat and slow fading and we say that a link is in _ outage _ if the ic experiences fading states that can not support a desired data rate .",
    "the fundamental question raised is how to define the _ outage rate region_. that is , which rate points can be achieved with a certain probability ?",
    "for multi - user systems , such as the ic , broadcast channel ( bc ) , and multiple - access channel ( mac ) , one can consider _ common _ or _ individual _ outage .",
    "we declare a common outage if the rate of at least one link can not be supported ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the bc ) .",
    "we declare an individual outage if a specific link is unable to communicate at the desired rate .",
    "so far , studies of outage rate regions have been restricted to the single - antenna bc and mac for which the outage capacity regions for instantaneous channel side information ( csi ) were given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for statistical csi ,",
    "the mac and bc were studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the instantaneous rate region for the miso ic is well - understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite , we defined the regions for individual and common outage for statistical csi and common outage for instantaneous csi . for the gaussian ic in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime ,",
    "recent research activities have explored the diversity - multiplexing trade - off ( dmt ) ( see e.g. , @xcite for characterization of the two - user ic ) . in @xcite ,",
    "our results in @xcite were used to approximately perform weighted sum - rate maximization under outage constraints for the miso ic with statistical csi . also for statistical csi , outage probabilities in the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) ic were given in closed form and an outage - based robust beamforming algorithm was proposed in @xcite .    in this paper , we propose and analyze achievable outage rate regions for the miso ic .",
    "the results generalize those of @xcite both in the sense that the bc and mac are special cases of the ic , and in that we treat the multiple antenna case .",
    "since we allow a non - zero outage probability , our results extend those of @xcite and @xcite where outage was not allowed .",
    "in contrast to the dmt analysis , e.g. , @xcite , our results are valid for any snr regime . for completeness",
    ", we consider common and individual outage for both instantaneous and statistical csi , but we focus on the individual outage rate region for instantaneous csi , which we did not treat in @xcite .",
    "a challenge is how to handle the scenario where either of the rates can be achieved , but not simultaneously .",
    "we solve this by proposing a stochastic mapping of the beamforming vectors that depends on the rates and the channels .",
    "we prove that the randomness of the mapping is independent of the channel realization . compared to @xcite ,",
    "the statistical csi definitions extend the single - stream transmission scheme to multi - stream . the definitions are valid for arbitrary assumptions on the channel distribution .",
