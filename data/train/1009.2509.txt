    "variations in the strength of emission from the accretion region around a compact object can reveal fundamental properties of the compact object and its accretion structure .",
    "for example , the frequencies associated with features in the power density spectra ( pds ) of these brightness variations are linked to physical time scales at different locations in the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such pds features include quasi - periodic oscillations , `` breaks '' where the slope of the pds changes , and broad - band components that can be fitted with lorentzian functions @xcite . empirically , the locations of these features depend on the type of object ; in x - ray binaries , the highest frequency at which significant variability exists is greater for neutron - star than black - hole accretors @xcite , consistent with the higher keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk around a neutron star .",
    "even an apparently featureless pds may hold the imprint of the underlying accreting object , as is evidenced by the correlation between the normalization of the pds at a particular frequency and the mass of the black hole in active galaxies compared to x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "an important case where accretion - related variations can reveal the nature of an accreting object is the wide , interacting binary - star system mira  ab ( @xmath3 ceti ) .",
    "mira  ab is a ` symbiotic - like ' or ` weakly symbiotic ' system at a distance of 107  pc @xcite . according to the preliminary orbit of @xcite ,",
    "the orbital period is 497.9 years , and the inclination is @xmath4 ( i.e. , we see the binary nearly edge - on ) .",
    "the donor star is the prototype of the mira - type class of pulsating agb stars , with a pulsation period of 332  days @xcite . a more compact companion , whose nature has been controversial , accretes from the wind of the agb star .",
    "although most indicators suggest that the accretor is a wd ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several authors have argued that the low x - ray luminosity implies it is a main - sequence ( ms ) star @xcite .",
    "determining whether mira  b is a wd or a ms star is imperative because its nature and evolutionary status impact our understanding of : 1 ) the efficiency of wind - fed accretion ; 2 ) mass transfer through disks with sizes of @xmath5  cm ; 3 ) x - ray emission from symbiotic stars ; and 4 ) the generation of the bipolar structure in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "because mira  ab is spatially resolved in the optical , x - ray , and radio @xcite , it is an excellent place to investigate the accretion of a stellar wind from a detached companion .",
    "roche lobe overflow is thermally unstable when the donor star in a binary is an evolved giant with a mass in excess of @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the mass of the accretor ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence symbiotic binaries , which typically have low - mass accretors @xcite , tend to transfer material via gravitational capture of the red - giant wind . in mira ab , x - ray observations revealed a bridge of material between the two stars @xcite that likely arises from the gravitational effects , as the wind speed ( 6  km  s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is of the same order as the stellar velocities .",
    "mira may thus be the first clear example of a new mode of mass transfer  dubbed ` wind roche lobe overflow ' @xcite or ` gravitational focusing ' @xcite  that lies somewhere between standard roche - lobe overflow and bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "this type of mass transfer may occur in those wide binaries that ultimately explode as type ia supernovae ( snia ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the yield from this channel of snia production depending on the efficiency of the mass transfer from the rg to the wd . since the inferred accretion rate onto mira  b ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the luminosity due to accretion , @xmath11 is the radius of the accretor , and @xmath12 is the gravitational constant ) differs by almost two orders of magnitude depending upon whether mira  b is a wd or a ms star , determining the nature of mira  b is critical for estimating @xmath13 and the ability of this channel to produce a snia .",
    "mira  ab will also test the hypothesis that the shapes of pne are the result of interactions between a star in its final stages of evolution and a binary companion @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that pre - pne commonly have bipolar morphologies and jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and most models for producing these structures require a binary companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite , however , estimated that only 1020% of pne contain binary central stars with separations small enough for the binary to have experienced a phase of common - envelope evolution , and @xcite argued that the roundness of the majority of the halos of pre - pne indicates that any binary companions in these systems must either be quite distant ( as in mira ) or have very low masses .",
    "mira  a is near its evolutionary end state , it has a distant binary companion , and recent ultraviolet ( uv ) images from the @xmath14 satellite revealed bipolar  streams \" of knots to the north and south @xcite .",
    "therefore , resolution of the issue of the nature of the companion would clear the path for models of mira  ab to confront questions such as how wide binaries generate bipolar structure in pne , which stellar component launches the bipolar outflows , and when asymmetry first appears .    in this paper",

    "qualitatively , whereas we are not aware of a single example of an accreting ms star with a high time resolution optical light curve resembling those of mira , most accreting wds have optical light curves that show mira - like aperiodic variations with a time scale of minutes  i.e. , faster than the dynamical time of a ms star .",

    "we therefore take the rapid variability to be related to accretion . furthermore",
    ", the rms amplitude of the @xmath15-band brightness variations from mira b between 1 and 10 mhz ( after accounting for the contribution from the red giant ) is around @xmath40%  almost identical to the characteristic value for cvs , which @xcite found to have rms variabilities in the same frequency range of 2.4% in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands and 4.5% in the @xmath43 band .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that we should not see such rapid variations from a ms accretor .",
    "the dynamical and viscous times at the inner edge of an accretion disk around a ms star are @xmath44 times longer than those at the inner edge of a disk around a wd .",
    "since these are likely the relevant time scales for setting the speed of brightness fluctuations , we expect an accreting ms star to exhibit stochastic variations that are stronger at low frequencies and weaker at high frequencies than the brightness fluctuations from an accreting wd .",
    "in fact , light variations have been detected from the accreting ms stars in algol binaries , and these variations preferentially occur on time scales of days rather than minutes ; @xcite found variations in the strength of double - peaked h@xmath45 emission , which they argue trace changes in the inner accretion disk , on time scales of days in a sample of 9 algol - type binaries .",
    "although we have no empirical constraints on variations from a ms - star disk in the frequency range of 1  10  mhz , we expect the amplitude of fluctuations in this frequency range to be orders of magnitude smaller than those from accreting wds , if , for example , the pds from an accreting ms star is simply that of a wd but shifted to lower frequencies",
    ". therefore , given that the amplitude of the high - frequency fluctuations from mira are consistent with those from cvs , and inconsistent with expectations for a ms star , we interpret the accreting object in mira as a wd .      before addressing the x - ray emission , we use the luminosity of mira  b in the uv and optical to estimate a characteristic accretion rate , @xmath13 , onto mira  b. uv observations with the @xmath46 satellite on 1980 june 16 ( when mira  a was at pulse minimum and therefore did not contribute to the uv flux ) revealed a uv continuum luminosity between 1800 and 3200 of @xmath47  erg  s@xmath8 ( which we estimated from the top panel of fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "as noted by @xcite , this estimate is a lower limit to the uv luminosity , since an accretion disk could also radiate in the lyman continuum , which @xmath46 would not detect .",
    "the @xmath27 spectra of mira  a and mira  b in figure 2 of @xcite , taken on 1995 december 11 , shows that mira  b produced @xmath48  erg  s@xmath8 between roughly 3200 and 5000 .",
    "given that mira  b also emits at wavelengths longer than 5000 , we estimate that the total , accretion - powered luminosity of mira  b is typically at least @xmath49  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "this luminosity implies that mira  b accretes at a rate of at least @xmath50 .",
    "consistent with our contention that mira  b is a wd , an accreting wd can naturally produce a uv spectrum like the one seen from mira .",
    "the @xmath46 spectra from mira between 1979 and 1983 contained lines with a range of ionization states , including  1240 ,  1550 , and  1400 , and line widths  from 135  km  s@xmath8 for absorption , to few hundred km  s@xmath8 for  1550 to @xmath51  km  s@xmath8 for ly@xmath45 and @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ly@xmath45 profiles that @xcite and @xcite reconstructed from h@xmath52 fluorescence lines observed by @xmath53 on 1999 august 2 and by @xmath54 on 2001 november 27 had full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately 1,100 to 1,200  km  s@xmath8 . velocities of greater than @xmath55  km  s@xmath8 are larger than the fastest kepler velocities in the vicinity of an accreting ms star , but comparable to the kepler velocities near an accreting wd .",
    "in fact , line widths of @xmath56  km  s@xmath8 are often seen in the uv spectra of cvs , which generally emanate from accretion - disk winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite determined that the temperature of the material producing the high - ionization resonance lines in the @xmath46 spectrum of mira ( which they take to be the coronal region of the disk ) was on the order of @xmath57  k  very reasonable for material near an accreting wd .",
    "regarding the x - ray emission from mira , an x - ray luminosity that is several orders of magnitude below the optical luminosity from the accretion disk , as we see from mira  b , is exactly what one would expect if the boundary layer ( bl ) around the accreting wd is optically thick @xcite or when the spreading layer ( sl ) on the accreting wd does not extend above the thin disk @xcite . for a slowly rotating wd ,",
    "roughly half of the energy released via accretion is radiated by the bl @xcite or in the latitudinal spreading of the material after it arrives on the wd @xcite .",
    "if the material is shocked as it arrives , the the high keplerian velocities near the surface of the wd produce hard x - rays that escape if the plasma is optically thin . with an accretion rate of @xmath58",
    ", we would expect a luminosity of at least a few times @xmath59  erg  s@xmath8 from the bl around mira  b. estimates of the x - ray luminosity , however , all indicate that @xmath60 is no more than a few times @xmath61  erg  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although a detailed investigation of the x - ray emission is beyond the scope of this paper , the low @xmath60 most likely reveals that the boundary ( or spreading ) layer is optically thick and therefore emitting primarily in the far- or extreme - uv instead of in the x - rays .",
    "@xcite found that for the wd in ss  cygni , the bl became optically thick when the accretion rate rose above @xmath62 , in accord with our hypothesis that the accretion rate onto mira  b is high enough to quench the x - ray emission .",
    "since the accretion rate at which the bl transitions from optically thin to optically thick increases with wd mass @xcite , the optical thickness of the bl around mira  b suggests that the mass of mira  b is lower than that of the wds in , e.g. , the symbiotic binaries t  crb , rt  cru , and ss73  17 , which contain wds with masses greater than 1.0  @xmath63 and bls that are optically thin at accretion rates as high as a few times @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the existence of other wds that accrete from the wind of a red giant and produce a very low x - ray luminosity supports our claim that the x - ray luminosity from mira  b is consistent with wd accretion .",
    "for example , the accretor in r  aqr , which @xcite also suggested was a ms star based on its low x - ray luminosity , was later shown by @xmath46 to have an effective temperature of 61,000  k and the radius of a wd @xcite .",
    "more generally , @xcite found that the bolometric luminosities of the wind - fed wds in symbiotic stars ( such as eg  andromedae , pu  vulpecula , and rx  puppis ) often exceed their x - ray luminosities by as much as 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , a different suggestion for mira  b  that the faint x - rays are coronal emission from a magnetically active , rapidly rotating low - mass ms star @xcite  can not explain either the strong uv emission ( compared to x - rays ) or the red - noise - type optical variations .",
    "whereas the luminosity of the rapidly variable component of the optical emission from mira  b is on the order of @xmath59  erg  s@xmath8 , the time - averaged power of optical radiation from stellar flares rarely exceeds @xmath65  erg  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , a ms star producing an x - ray luminosity of a few times @xmath61  erg  s@xmath8 due to coronal emission would only have a time - averaged optical power from flares of @xmath66  erg  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we can thus rule out coronal emission from a magnetically active , rapidly rotating , ms star on energetic grounds .",
    "the radio emission from mira  b is also one to three orders of magnitude greater than expected from a magnetically active dwarf @xcite .",
    "in contrast , all available observations are consistent with the picture in which a wd is accreting from the wind of the red giant .",
    "our main conclusion is that the rapid optical variability from mira  ab reveals mira  b to be a wd .",
    "the amplitude of the optical brightness fluctuations from mira  b on time scales of minutes is the same as those from accreting wds in cvs , and significantly larger than one would expect from an accreting ms star .",
    "the uv spectra  especially the ionization states and widths of the lines  are consistent with the conclusion that mira  b is a wd .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and spectrum are also consistent with this conclusion if the accretion - disk boundary layer is optically thick , as one would reasonably expect for our estimated accretion rate of @xmath67 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    ".    this accretion rate , which we infer from the optical and uv luminosities of mira  b , is consistent with constraints on the effective temperature of the wd from uv spectra .",
    "sion ( 1999 ) noted that prolonged accretion will re - heat an otherwise cooling wd , making it potentially visible in the uv or optical continuum .",
    "such rejuvenated wds are seen in dwarf novae systems during quiescence , revealing effective temperature of @xmath68 10,00020,000  k @xcite .",
    "this wd re - heating @xcite and the resulting @xmath69 depend on both @xmath7 and the time - averaged accretion rate , @xmath70 , thereby providing another constraint for our analysis of mira b. from the uv continuum flux upper limit @xmath71 , reimers and cassatella ( 1985 ) found @xmath72 for @xmath73 ( for a wd with @xmath74 and a distance of 77 pc ; a slightly higher @xmath75 is allowed at our adopted distance of 107 pc ) . a direct application of ( * ? ? ?",

    "a nova eruption from mira would thus perhaps look more like those of the symbiotic slow novae than , say , an x - ray bright eruption of the symbiotic recurrent nova rs  ophiuchi @xcite or the @xmath80-ray producing explosion of the symbiotic v407  cygni @xcite . from the work of @xcite",
    ", we would expect a nova recurrence time of @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "our conclusion that mira  b is a wd accreting at @xmath84 has implications for the mode and efficiency of mass transfer in wide binaries .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite have suggested that a focused wind could enable up to tens of percent of the donor wind to be captured , the accretion rate needed to produce mira  b s luminosity and effective temperature is just 0.1% of the rg wind mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "it is also below the bondi - hoyle accretion rate of @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the relative velocity of the wind at mira  b. thus we find no evidence that either gravitational focusing or wind roche - lobe overflow is enhancing the accretion efficiency onto the wd in this binary , despite the image showing a bridge of x - ray emitting material between the two stars @xcite .    identifying mira  b as a wd also has ramifications for the launch site of the bipolar `` streams '' that have been imaged in the near- and far - uv with @xmath87 @xcite and in the optical from the ground @xcite .",
    "based on the behavior of other wds that accrete from wind - fed disks in symbiotic binaries , we speculate that the the bipolar streams emanate from the accreting wd rather than , or in addition to , the pulsating agb star . @xcite has suggested that symbiotic stars in which the wind of the red giant is focused toward orbital plane  as has been seen to be the case for mira @xcite  preferentially contain large , unstable accretion disks , which tend to produce sporadic bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "@xmath87 observations indicate that the streams from mira contain about @xmath88 of material ( don neill , private communication ) , and @xcite estimated that the streams were ejected over the course of the past @xmath51  yr . the average rate of flow into the streams was thus roughly @xmath89 . given our estimate of the accretion rate , mira  b could fairly easily pump @xmath90 into the streams , which is roughly consistent with the observational estimate of the mass - loss from the wd by @xcite during the @xmath46 era . given the large uncertainties on both the rate of accretion onto mira  b",
    ", the average rate of mass loss from mira  b , and the rate of flow in the bipolar streams , we conclude that the wd remains a viable the launch site , and that the streams do not _ necessarily _ originate from the rg .",

    "<S> the nature of the accreting companion to mira  the prototypical pulsating asymptotic giant branch star  has been a matter of debate for more than 25 years . </S>",
    "<S> here we use a quantitative analysis of the rapid optical brightness variations from this companion , mira  b , which we observed with the nickel telescope at lick observatory , to show that it is a white dwarf ( wd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of aperiodic optical variations on time scales of minutes to tens of minutes ( @xmath0  mag ) is consistent with that of accreting wds in cataclysmic variables on these same time scales . </S>",
    "<S> it is significantly greater than that expected from an accreting main - sequence star . </S>",
    "<S> with mira  b identified as a wd , its ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical luminosities , along with constraints on the wd effective temperature from the uv , indicate that it accretes at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any evidence that the accretion rate is higher than predicted by bondi - hoyle theory . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rate is high enough , however , to explain the weak x - ray emission , since the accretion - disk boundary layer around a low - mass wd accreting at this rate is likely to be optically thick and therefore to emit primarily in the far or extreme uv . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the finding that mira  b is a wd means that it has experienced , and will continue to experience nova explosions , roughly every @xmath2 years . </S>",
    "<S> it also highlights the similarity between mira  ab and other jet - producing symbiotic binaries such as r  aquarii , ch  cygni , and mwc  560 , and therefore raises the possibility that mira  b launched the recently discovered bipolar streams from this system . </S>"
