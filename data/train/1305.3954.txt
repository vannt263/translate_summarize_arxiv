    "our goal in developing v - t theory is to apply the established techniques of many body physics to the mechanical problem of the motion of atoms in a monatomic liquid .",

    "@xcite    in the absence of such a many body formulation , liquid dynamics theory has been advanced by a series of conceptual developments .",
    "an important early step was learning how to construct physically realistic interatomic potentials for nearly - free - electron metals from pseudopotential perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite it was shown that md calculations using these potentials give an excellent account of experimental data for elemental condensed systems , for example : for thermodynamic properties of crystals  @xcite and liquids ,  @xcite and for the liquid structure factor  @xcite and dynamic structure factor .",

    "md was introduced ,  @xcite and has since become the method of choice for reliable calculations on many liquid types .",
    "the resulting physical picture of liquids as nuclei moving on the ground state adiabatic potential , and subject to conventional statistical mechanical averaging , is the basis of our theoretical work .",
    "formal derivation of the corresponding condensed matter hamiltonian is reviewed in ch .  1 of ref . .",
    "the conceptual contribution of v - t theory is to classify the valleys that comprise the liquid s many - body potential surface as random or symmetric .",
    "the random valleys all have the same statistical mechanical averages , and together they dominate the potential surface in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "@xcite originally a hypothesis , this classification has been numerically verified for various representative systems .",
    "@xcite the atomic motion is vibrations in one ( any ) random valley , interspersed by transits , which carry the system between random valleys .",
    "accordingly , we define the extended random valley as the harmonic extension to infinity of any random valley , and take the hamiltonian @xmath10 for motion in one extended random valley as our zeroth order liquid hamiltonian . to study any particular function ,",
    "we first calculate the function assuming the hamiltonian is @xmath11 and then we examine the ( often small ) remainder to see how models of transit motion can account for it .",

    "@xcite this formulation requires extension in two ways : in order to treat _ all _ thermodynamic properties , the transit entropy theory must be replaced by a free energy theory ; and in order to make a purely _ liquid _ theory , all sensitivity to the nature of the crystal or the melting process must be removed .",

    "@xcite the purpose of the present work is to test the viability of v - t theory for the distinct part of the density autocorrelation function .",

    "<S> the complete model incorporates a property common to both self and distinct decorrelation : simple exponential decay following a delay period , where the delay is @xmath4 , the time required for the random walk to emerge from the drift . </S>",
    "<S> our final result is an accurate expression for @xmath0 for all @xmath2 through the first peak in @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a modification will be required at @xmath2 where @xmath7 converges to zero . ) </S>",
    "<S> the theory is calibrated and tested using molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations for liquid na at 395  k ; however , the theory itself does not depend on md , and we consider other means for calibrating it . </S>"
