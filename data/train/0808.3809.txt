    "searching high - t@xmath3 superconducting states in correlated electron systems has been one of the central topics in condensed matter physics for several decades @xcite . with the development of synthesis technique",

    "the multi - gap sc nature is one of the most interested .",
    "the multi - gap sc characters have been found in a number of compounds , for example , in nodal structure sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8@xcite , in @xmath1-wave sc nbse@xmath7@xcite and mgb@xmath7 @xcite , in heavy - fermion sc ce@xmath9la@xmath10coin@xmath11 @xcite , and in d - wave sc pbbi@xmath4sr@xmath4cuo@xmath12@xcite and bi2212 @xcite .",
    "recently , a generic two - gap hypothesis is also proposed for the cuprate sc @xcite .",
    "further , in the iron - based sc discovered recently @xcite , some experiments also showed that lao@xmath9f@xmath13feas is two - gap sc @xcite . on the other hand , in the heavy - fermion sc ce@xmath9la@xmath10coin@xmath11 @xcite ,",
    "it is found recently that there coexist uncondensed carriers and the sc carriers , and a fraction of electrons on the fermi surfaces does not participate in sc , displaying unusual sc characteristics in ce@xmath9la@xmath10coin@xmath11 .",
    "since these compounds share the same properties in the electronic structures , _",
    "i.e. _ , the multi - orbital or multi - band character @xcite , it naturally arises the question that whether the condensed and the uncondensed phases generally coexist in the multi - orbital sc compounds ?    in the past decade , it has been found that numerous correlated electron compounds are multi - orbital , and many unique features are contributed from the orbital degree of freedom , such as colossal magnetoresistance and complex orbital ordered phases in doped manganites@xcite , the exotic magnetism in the @xmath14-electron systems @xcite , and the debated orbital selective mott transition ( osmt ) in sr@xmath15ca@xmath13ruo@xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 the orbital degree of freedom on the sc plays an important role in the sc pairing symmetry of the multi - orbital systems @xcite . on the other hand , liu @xmath18 @xmath19@xcite proposed that there may exist an interior gap superfluidity in a two - orbital system , in which the pairing interaction carves out a gap within the interior of a large fermi ball , while the exterior surface remains gapless ; and it is a simultaneously sc and normal state at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the role of orbital degree of freedom on the pairing symmetry and sc condensation is far from well understood .",
    "so , much effort is still needed to uncover the sc nature in strongly correlated multi - orbital compounds .    with this motivation , and stimulated by searching for a new state of matter , we study the sc properties of the strongly correlated multi - orbital systems in this paper .",
    "we extend the single - orbital @xmath0 model to the two - orbital @xmath0 model , and utilize the auxiliary - boson method @xcite to obtain the phase diagram of the system on a square lattice .",
    "we find that for given strong interactions between electrons , the electrons may bind as many paired quasiparticles as possible in one orbit due to the symmetry breaking in the orbital space .",
    "these quasiparticles condense into a coherent state at low temperature , and the residual unpaired electrons in the other orbit constitute a separated normal fluid , forming the orbital selective sc ( ossc ) phase .",
    "the ossc phase is the stablest , against to the normal phase and the full - gapped sc ones , in proper parametric and doping regime .",
    "we also obtain the critical points of the formation of ossc phase for various parameters of the two - orbital @xmath0 model , which may shed light on finding this phase in the strongly correlated compounds .",
    "the possible application of the present theory on the fe - based sc lao@xmath9f@xmath13feas is also discussed .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we describe the two - orbital @xmath0 model and the framework of the auxiliary - boson mean field approach .",
    "and then we present the detailed formulation of the two - orbital sc . in sec.iii",

    "these equations are slightly different .",
    "in this section , we present the essential properties of the sc and the phase diagram of the two - orbital @xmath0 model . provided the two - orbital model is su(2 ) symmetric in the spin space , we would have the relations for the single occupation amplitude @xmath95 and for the sc order parameters , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ( m=1,2 ) .",
    "this will greatly simplify our discussion in what follows .",
    "we firstly determine the stablest ground state of the two - orbital @xmath0 model with n=1-@xmath80 in a square lattice through comparing the groundstate energy of the possible gs candidates : the normal state with @xmath98=0 , the @xmath2-wave symmetric sc phase with @xmath99 , or the @xmath1-wave - like symmetric sc phase with @xmath100 . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt the relationship @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , unless specific explanation . here the ratio of the hopping integrals is defined as r = t@xmath104/t@xmath105 .",
    "the larger r deviates from the unity , the larger asymmetry degree of the orbital space is . by minimizing the gs energy ,",
    "we obtain phase diagrams of the systems for various parameters , such as the doping concentration @xmath80 , the exchange parameters @xmath106 and the asymmetric ratio of the hopping integrals , r , and the orbital level splitting , @xmath48 .",
    "our numerical results show that the energy of the @xmath1-wave - like sc state is lower than that of the @xmath2-wave state for all the situations we investigated . out of this reason , we focus on the s - wave like symmetric order parameters of the multi - orbital @xmath0 model in the following .",
    "the ground state strongly depends on the doping , the orbital asymmetry ratio , the level splitting and the the superexchange coupling strength , as shown the following phase diagrams .",
    "these phase diagrams demonstrate that there exists a new sc phase that is simultaneously sc and normal at zero temperature , analogous to the interior gap superfluidity proposed by liu @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    we first present the evolution of the sc order parameters with the doping concentration .",
    "the order parameters @xmath98 as the functions of doping @xmath80 in different parametric region are distinctly different , as shown in fig .",
    "when the system is su(4 ) symmetric with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , it is clearly seen that the sc order parameters of the two orbits , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are equal . with the increase of doping @xmath80 , the sc order parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "simultaneously decrease and become zero at a critical value @xmath111 , which is smaller than the critical value @xmath112 of the single - orbital @xmath0 model for sc phase .",
    "so , in the two - gap sc ( tgsc ) phase with su(4 ) symmetry , the sc energy gaps of the two orbits are identical .    when the nearest - neighbor hoppings of the two orbits become asymmetric , such as , in the situation of @xmath113 and @xmath108 , we find that the order parameter of the orbit-1 , @xmath109 , deviates from that of the orbit-2 , @xmath110",
    ". with the increase of @xmath80 , the sc order parameter @xmath110 in the narrow band firstly vanishes at a critical value , @xmath114 . on the contrast , the sc order parameter @xmath109 gradually decreases and becomes zero at @xmath115 .",
    "thus in the doping region @xmath116 , the system is in the tgsc phase that both orbits / bands are sc . while in the region @xmath117",
    ", a novel phase appears , in which the wide orbit is sc , while the narrow orbit is in the normal phase .",
    "this new phase is called the orbital selective superconductive ( ossc ) phase , as seen the shaded region in fig .",
    "since the degree of the broken symmetry is not large , such a phase , analogous to the interior gap superfluidity@xcite , occurs only in a very narrow region in the phase diagram .",
    "the symmetry breaking arising from the crystal field splitting e@xmath118 also leads to the stable ossc phase .",
    "as shown in fig.1c , the ossc phase in the situation @xmath107 and @xmath119 is more robust . in this situation , with the increase of @xmath80 ,",
    "both the sc order parameters @xmath120 decrease asynchronously , as seen in fig . 1c .",
    "@xmath110 vanishes at @xmath115 , and @xmath109 vanishes at @xmath121 .",
    "there also exist three different phases , the tgsc phase , the ossc phase and the normal ones . among these phases , the presence of crystalline field splitting favors the formation of the ossc phase .",
    "we notice that in fig.1 , when the orbital rotational symmetry is broken , the sc order parameters at @xmath122 0 are considerably larger than those with orbital rotational symmetry , demonstrating that the sc pairing strength may be enhanced by the orbital asymmetry , as we seen in next subsection .",
    "in fact , whether there exists the ossc phase reflects the orbital symmetry of the systems . for @xmath107 and @xmath108 ,",
    "the system has the su(2 ) symmetry in the orbital space . in other words",
    ", there is no difference between the two orbits , their order parameters simultaneously decrease and vanish .",
    "therefore , the tgsc and the normal phases are the stablest in this situation .",
    "whilst , in the situations of @xmath113 , @xmath108 and @xmath107 , @xmath119 , the rotation symmetry in the orbital space is broken because of the inequivalence of the two orbits for the case with @xmath113 and @xmath108 or the case with @xmath123 and @xmath119 .",
    "the asymmetry of the two orbits leads to that the sc gaps of the two orbits are out of synchronization when approaching the critical points .",
    "for example , in the situation with @xmath113 and @xmath108 , due to the asymmetry of the two hopping integrals , the electrons in the narrow orbit feel weaker attractive interaction than those in the wide orbit , and forming a small sc gap .",
    "thus , with the increasing of @xmath80 , the electrons in the narrow orbit will first enter the normal state ; at the same time , the electrons in the wide orbit may be still sc , as seen in fig.1b and 1c .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]    to get more insight to the behavior of the ossc phase , we study how the phase diagram evolves with @xmath124 , and the numerical result is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the system with @xmath125 and @xmath108 ,",
    "it is clearly seen in fig.2a that the difference between @xmath109 and @xmath110 increases with the deviation of @xmath124 from the unity .",
    "the sc order parameters exhibit different behavior : @xmath110 monotonously increases and saturates at @xmath126 ; however , @xmath109 monotonously decreases and vanishes at @xmath127 , indicating the appearance of the ossc phase . as the doping concentration increases to @xmath128 in fig.2b , the two sc order parameters behave similar to the first situation .",
    "finally , the tgsc - ossc phase transition occurs at @xmath129 .",
    "the critical value of the tgsc - ossc phase transition becomes larger with the increase of @xmath80 , in agreement with the results in fig .",
    "1 . the asymmetric behavior of the sc order parameters arises from the symmetry breaking of the system in orbital space .",
    "again , the asymmetry of the electron kinetic energy in two orbits favors the lift of the sc gap in the tgsc phase .",
    "when the hopping integral ratio r is greater than the unity , the behavior of @xmath109 is inter - changed with that of @xmath110 .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]      not only the asymmetric hopping integrals , but also the crystalline field splitting @xmath48 can break the orbital su(2 ) symmetry of the system , leading to the formation of the ossc phase , as seen in fig.3 .",
    "for the situation with @xmath107 and @xmath128 shown in fig.3a , the positive crystalline field splitting @xmath48 enhances the sc order parameter in orbit-1 , @xmath109 , however , suppresses that in orbit-2 , @xmath110 .",
    "the system is in the tgsc phase when @xmath48 is lower than the critical value , @xmath130=0.125 .",
    "when the crystalline field splitting is greater than a critical value , @xmath130=0.125 , the order parameter @xmath110 vanishes .",
    "the system enters the ossc regime .",
    "for the situation with @xmath113 , the phase diagram is shown in fig.3b . compared with the situation in fig.3a ,",
    "the difference between the sc order parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 is so significant that @xmath110 is negligible as @xmath131 0.042 , implying that the ossc phase is more robust in the presence of the large level splitting and the orbital - rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "for the situation with r=1 , the negative crystalline field splitting e@xmath118 reverse the behavior of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we find that similar to the role of the rotation symmetry breaking in orbital space , the remove of the orbital level degeneracy by the crystalline field splitting also enhances the occurrence of the ossc phase .",
    "obviously , both of the cases break the symmetry of the orbital space .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry of the two orbits favors the ossc phase .",
    "-0.6 cm [ 1.15 ]      similar to the single - orbital @xmath0 model @xcite , when two superexchange pairing interactions @xmath106 and @xmath132 are too small , the normal state is stable against the sc phase , as shown in fig.4a and fig.4b . in the orbital su(4 ) system with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the sc order parameter of the orbit-1 , @xmath109 , is equal to that of the orbit-2 , @xmath110 , due to the symmetry in the orbital space . with the increase of the interaction strength @xmath106 , the order parameters @xmath98 ( m=1,2 ) become finite at @xmath133 .",
    "the system lies in the tgsc regime . under the situation of @xmath107 and @xmath134 ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath109 in the orbit-1 deviates from that in the orbit-2 due to the breaking of the orbital su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "compared with the case of the orbital su(2 ) symmetry , a small crystal field splitting drives the narrow - band sc order parameter @xmath110 to zero rapidly , and induces the occurrence of the ossc - normal phase transition near the critical value @xmath135 .    from the discussion above , we have demonstrated that in proper parametric and doping regions , the ossc phase is stablest , in comparison with the tgsc phase and the normal state in the multi - orbital @xmath0 model .",
    "the requirement condition for the occurrence of the ossc phase is that the orbital su(2 ) symmetry of the system is broken in the orbital space . generally speaking ,",
    "the larger the hopping integral ratio @xmath124 deviates from the unity , the larger the difference between two gaps is ; so does the crystalline field splitting @xmath48 .",
    "further , only in the proper doping and the interaction @xmath106 region , where the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing glue is strong enough , the system is stable in the ossc state .",
    "one should recall that the present @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry is @xmath136-type , which exhibits nodes along the @xmath137=@xmath138 , rather than the full - gapped bcs - type @xmath1-wave sc .",
    "such a singlet pairing symmetry is also in agreement with kubo s result @xcite    the novelty of ossc phase is the coexistence of the low - energy `` normal state '' excitations and superconductivity .",
    "such character could be manifested directly in the tunneling experiments , @xmath139 , the tunneling spectra may consist of those of the cooper pairs and the normal electrons . to a certain extent ,",
    "the ossc phase is similar to the conventional sc with nodes , such as the @xmath2-wave sc cuprate , or the @xmath78-wave sc sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 , @xmath18 @xmath19 however , the ossc phase differs from these states both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "quantitatively , the dos of ossc phase is larger than those of the gapless modes ; and qualitatively , the ossc phase does not have the pairing symmetry of the @xmath2-wave or the @xmath78-wave sc .",
    "although the ossc state bears the resemblance to the interior gap superfluidity @xcite , there is qualitative difference between these two states .",
    "firstly , the microcosmic mechanisms of the superconductivity are different , since the present sc phases are mediated through the spin fluctuations , while the interior superfluid forms through the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "secondly , the precondition of the interior gap superfluidity requires that the effective masses of the quasiparticle in the two branches is different ; whilst , our theory predicts that the ossc phase can exist even if the effective masses in both orbits are identical , providing that crystalline field splitting is large .    to date",
    ", no direct experimental observation about the novel ossc phase is available .",
    "nevertheless , we could find some hints in the anomalous properties of some unconventional sc .",
    "recently , by measuring the thermal conductivity and the specific heat in the heavy - fermion sc ce@xmath9la@xmath140in@xmath11 @xcite , tanatar @xmath18 @xmath19 proposed that in the doped compound , there coexist uncondensed electrons and nodal quasiparticles . and more recent thermal measurement @xcite demonstrated that in undoped cecoin@xmath11 , there exists the multigap structure in the sc phase . from the present ossc scenario ,",
    "these two behaviors are consistent with each other , rather than contradict with each other . since the number of orbits and the dispersion relation in cecoin@xmath11 are different from the present simple model , more effort is needed to directly compare the present theory and experimental results in cecoin@xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the fe - based sc discovered recently may be another candidate of the ossc phase .",
    "some recent studies suggested that in undoped laofeas , the electron correlation between fe 3d electrons is strong and plays an important role in the ground state @xcite , and the first - principles electronic structure calculations suggest that two or more orbits are involved in the superconductivity , implying that the multi - orbital @xmath0 model is appropriate for describing the low - energy physics of the iron - based sc . with the increase of f - doping concentration",
    ", the system undergoes from the normal to the sc states . the two - gap character in sufficient f - doped laofeas @xcite suggests that in the some doping region , these may exist the unconventional sc phase .",
    "surely , we expect that more elaborate experiments and the comparisons between the theory and the experiment can be performed to uncover the unconventional sc phase .",
    "in summary , by using the extended auxiliary - boson approach , we have demonstrated that in the multi - orbital @xmath0 models , besides the two - gap superconducting phase , an orbital selective superconducting ground state may be stable , when the orbital su(2 ) symmetry is broken in the correlated electronic systems .",
    "such a new phase is s - wave like .",
    "the superconducting order parameters strongly depend on the asymmetry of the hopping @xmath124 and the crystal field splitting @xmath48 .",
    "the more the deviation from the orbital su(2 ) symmetry is , the more robust the orbital selective superconducting phase is .",
