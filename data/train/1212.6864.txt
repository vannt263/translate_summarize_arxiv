    "the quark helicity distribution , which measures the net helicity of quarks in a longitudinally polarized nucleon , @xmath4 is an essential observable encoding the spin structure of the nucleon  @xcite . during the past two decades",
    ", the @xmath5 dependence of the helicity distribution has been studied extensively , including the parametrizations   @xcite from experimental data and model calculations  @xcite . however , the transverse momentum dependence  @xcite of the helicity distribution still remains poorly known . in recent years",
    ", it is found that the quark transverse motion plays a crucial role  @xcite through spin - orbit correlation in certain spin phenomena , such as the single spin asymmetries measured in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite and elsewhere ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand",
    ", the inclusion of quark intrinsic transverse momentum can provide much richer information about the nucleon structure  @xcite that can not be obtained from the collinear picture .",
    "thus it is necessary to revisit the quark transverse motion effect to the quark helicity distribution , especially its transverse momentum dependence that can help to build a three - dimensional partonic structure of the longitudinal polarized nucleon .    as a step toward a better understanding of this issue",
    ", we study in this paper the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) helicity distribution of the valence quarks , denoted by @xmath6 , using the light - cone diquark model , which has been applied to calculate the @xmath5 dependence of the helicity distribution  @xcite , the transversity distribution  @xcite and a number of other tmd distributions  @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the tmd helicity distribution in two different approaches corresponding to two different options of the unpolarized tmd distribution .",
    "the tmd helicity distribution enters the description of the sidis process when the transverse momentum of the final hadron @xmath0 is measured . using the model results from the light - cone diquark model",
    ", we calculate the double spin asymmetry ( dsa ) of pion production in the sidis process as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the clas collaboration has measured  @xcite such asymmetry using a polarized electron beam to collide a longitudinally polarized proton target recently , and such measurement provides the first experimental glimpse of the tmd helicity distribution .",
    "although it is possible to access the tmd helicity distribution from sidis data , usually one has to model the quark transverse momentum dependence in phenomenological analysis because calculating the cross section differentiated by @xmath0 involves complicated convolution of transverse momenta  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the convolution can be resolved through the @xmath0-weighted procedure  @xcite in a model - independent way , and the weighted cross section involves the transverse moments of the tmd distributions .",
    "however , much of the information about the explicit transverse momentum dependence is lost in this way .",
    "an alternative approach has been developed using the bessel functions as weighting functions in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors show that the convolution becomes a product of tmd distributions and tmd fragmentation functions ( ffs ) in the fourier space ( also referred to as the transverse coordinate space , denoted by @xmath7 ) conjugate to @xmath8 . the tmd distributions in the @xmath7 space",
    "thus can be measured directly by the bessel - weighted asymmetries whose expressions in leading twist have been given in ref .",
    "this motivates us to examine the bessel - weighted dsa in sidis by model calculation since it might be measured easier than other bessel - weighted asymmetries . to this end",
    "we calculate the fourier - transformed tmd helicity distribution in the light - cone diquark model and make the prediction for the bessel - weighted dsa of pion production in sidis for the first time .",
    "the results are presented at the kinematics of clas , hermes  @xcite , and compass  @xcite , where there are ongoing sidis programs or there are data that could be analyzed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the calculation of the tmd helicity distributions of valence quarks in the light - cone diquark model and discuss their properties .",
    "we then calculate the dsas of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 productions in sidis . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the valence helicity distributions in the fourier space and present the prediction of the bessel - weighted dsas of three pions in sidis at clas , hermes and compass .",
    "finally , we provide summaries in sec .",
    "the tmd helicity distribution @xmath9 is defined through the matrix elements of the bilocal operator @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gauge link ensuring the gauge invariance of the definition . in this calculation the gauge link is set to be trivial since the helicity distribution is @xmath12 even .",
    "one can insert a complete set of intermediate states @xmath13 into eq.([g1ldef ] ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the  good \" component of the quark field , and @xmath16 are the helicity projection operators . similarly the tmd unpolarized distribution has the form @xmath17    the tmd helicity distribution has been calculated by different models , such as the diquark spectator model  @xcite , the light - cone constituent quark model  @xcite , the covariant parton model  @xcite , and the bag model  @xcite ; recently it has also been studied by lattice qcd  @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt the light - cone diquark model  @xcite to calculate the valence tmd helicity distributions .",
    "the above mentioned models have been widely applied to calculate various tmd distributions  @xcite , including the @xmath12-even and @xmath12-odd distributions . here",
    "a few comments on these models are in order .",
    "the common feature of the diquark spectator model  @xcite and the light - cone diquark model  @xcite is that when every valence quark is probed , one treats the other part of the nucleon as a spectator and uses the diquark quantum numbers to effectively take into account the spectator contributions .",
    "the advantage of the diquark - type models is that the complicated many - particle system can be treated by a two - particle technique . in the light - cone constituent quark model  @xcite",
    ", the proton state is described in terms of three free on - shell valence quarks .",
    "the tmd distributions are calculated through the light - cone wavefunctions that take into account the full dynamics of three valence quarks . in the covariant parton model approach  @xcite ,",
    "the partons are free , and are assumed to be described in terms of three - dimensional spherically symmetric momentum distributions in the nucleon rest frame .",
    "different from the above - mentioned models , the bag model is the quark model which incorporates confinement , i.e. , it describes the nucleon as three massless quarks confined inside a sphere , modeled by the bag boundary condition  @xcite . both the covariant parton model and the bag model support the gaussian dependence of the quark transverse momenta  @xcite , while in the diquark model and the light - cone constituent model the transverse momentum dependent can be non - gaussian .",
    "notice that the proton wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ pup ] ) is in the instant form dynamics with equal @xmath28 in an ordinary frame ; however , the parton distributions are usually expressed in the infinite momentum frame or in the light - front dynamics on the light cone .",
    "thus , we need to transform the wavefunction in the instant form to that in the light - cone form . the connection between the two forms is through a melosh - wigner rotation  @xcite . for a spin-@xmath29 particle ,",
    "we use @xmath30 and @xmath31 to denote the instant and light - cone spinors , respectively , and the melosh - wigner rotation is known to be  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35^{-1/2}$ ] with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are mass parameters for the quark and diquark , and @xmath39 denotes the melosh - wigner rotation matrix for the spin-@xmath40 particles . for the spin-0 scalar diquark , there is no such transformation . for the spin-1 vector diquarks ,",

    "<S> the transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions of valence quarks are calculated in the light - cone diquark model by adopting two different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we use the model results to analyze the @xmath0-dependent double spin asymmetries for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 productions in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , and find that the asymmetries agree with the clas data in one of the approaches . by taking the fourier transform of the transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions , we obtain the helicity distributions of valence quarks in the transverse coordinate space , and then apply them further to predict the bessel - weighted double spin asymmetries of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 productions in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering at clas , compass , and hermes for the first time . the shape of the bessel - weighted double spin asymmetry thereby provides a direct probe on the transverse structure of longitudinally polarized quarks . </S>"
