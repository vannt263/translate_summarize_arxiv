    ", the cooling timescale of this gas is very short , so that its temperature should decrease much below the @xmath184 measured in the optical knots p - v .",
    "we conclude that , most likely , the   line intensity was highly overestimated . as pointed out by hatchell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the calibration of the 460  ghz receiver was highly uncertain at the time of the  observations .",
    "if we repeat the analysis considering only the first three co transitions and taking into account the uncertainty in the measured flux ( about @xmath185 ) , a good agreement is obtained for a co column density @xmath186 .",

    "applying their work to the case of the hh  111 bullets , we estimate a typical cooling time of @xmath190 if the temperature of the bullets is as high as @xmath93 .",

    "the similar mass transport rates support the view that the co bullets are not made of ambient material that has been accelerated to these very high velocities , but are mostly composed of material ejected from the central engine .",

    "such mechanism leads to the formation of `` mini - bows '' along the jet . in this framework",
    ", the high - velocity co bullets would trace the previously shocked molecular counterpart of the optical knots .",
    "it naturally explains the similar properties observed between the jet and the high - velocity bullets ( size , kinematics , momentum ) .",
    "the weak high - velocity component detected between b1 and b2 ( see fig .  6 in cr ) traces the molecular `` intershock '' gas ejected from the central source , between two `` eruptions '' .",
    "the kinematics of the outflowing gas is complex as it bears the signature of several ejection episodes in the optical jet , associated with bow shocks at knots f and l ( rei97 ; raga et al .",
    "we also find strong correlation between the low- and high- velocity outflow wings and the jet .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that a single fit of any outflow model is able to reproduce the kinematics of the gas observed along the whole flow length . as the ejecta",
    "are located inside the cavity , close to the source ( within @xmath201 ) , we have decided to concentrate on the global properties of the cavity , at larger distance from the source .",
    "our interferometric data have revealed a large cylindrical cavity in which the gas is accelerated following a `` hubble law '' @xmath157 , distance along the jet axis .",
    "the formation of such large cavities is easily accounted for by the sweeping up of ambient material as a bow shock propagates into the parental cloud ( rc93 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we show that that such gas entrainment models can indeed account for the molecular outflow emission in hh  111 .",
    "we first determine the parameters of the `` best '' model that fits the hh  111 molecular gas distribution .",
    "as shown by rc93 , the global shape of the cavity swept - up by an internal bow shock depends on two parameters  : the density stratification of the ambient medium and the ratio between the distance of the working surface to the source @xmath202 and the standoff distance between the working surface and the bow shock apex @xmath203 .    for a jet propagating into a medium of density @xmath204",
    ", @xmath156 measuring the distance from the powering source along the jet axis , the following relation holds between the jet cylindrical radius @xmath205 and @xmath156  : @xmath206 . as discussed above and in sect .",
    "4.3 , the shape of the cavity _ near _ the source is suggestive of @xmath207 .",
    "the standoff distance @xmath203 between the ejection point in the working surface and the bow shock apex is related to the jet radius via  : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the solid angle over which mass is ejected ( @xmath210 ) , @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the ejection and jet velocities , respectively ( see eq .  4 in rc93 ) .    in the case of strong working surfaces such as those observed in hh  111 ,",
    "the ratio between the jet and the ambient density @xmath213 is @xmath214 ( raga & binette 1991 ) and @xmath215 in the adiabatic case .",
    "hence @xmath216 and @xmath217 , with a typical jet radius of @xmath218 ( rei97 ) .",
    "a simple determination comes from the shape of the cavity computed in the case @xmath207 .",
    "the cylindrical radius is typically twice the standoff distance ( see for example the top panel of fig .",
    "3 ) ; it is not very sensitive to the actual value of @xmath219 nor the distance of the bow shock to the source . at zeroth order ,",
    "the diameter of the cavity determined in the outer part is @xmath220 , hence @xmath221 .",
    "this simple determination is consistent with the upper limit obtained previously .",
    "it is also consistent with numerical simulations , which yield @xmath222 .",
    "since bow shock v lies at @xmath223 from the source ( rei97 ) , one has @xmath224 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "6 the shape of the cavity swept - up by a bow shock as predicted for this set of parameters .",
    "this model fits nicely the walls of the cavity and the curvature of bow shock v. the agreement is very satisfying at @xmath225 .",
    "we have fitted the inner walls of the cavity by straight lines ( drawn in dashed dark contours in fig .",
    "6 ) ; the optical jet emission appears to fill exactly the cavity walls up to @xmath226 . extrapolating the fit up to bow shock v , we find that the separation of the walls at that position is @xmath227 .",
    "it matches well the size of the bow shock in the @xmath132 optical line ( see top panel in fig .",
    "6 ) , as expected for freely expanding shocked material .    for values of @xmath219 of @xmath228 ,",
    "the model predicts that the velocity vs position along the axis is almost exactly linear over the whole flow length , except close to the source .",
    "this is again consistent with the position - velocity diagram derived from our interferometric maps ( see fig .",
    "the situation is more complex closer to the source  : molecular gas emission is still detected beyond the fit , so that the agreement between the fit and the actual shape of the cavity is not very good .",
    "several factors may contribute to this .",
    "in particular , several ejections have taken place recently , which are now observed as knots e to l. since this part of the cavity has experienced the crossing of two more bow shocks ( p and l ) , the walls have been transferred additional momentum .",
    "this could contribute to our detection of entrained gas at further distances from the jet axis .",
    "these results differ somewhat from the previous conclusions of nagar et al .",
    "based on their interferometric map of the @xmath229 line emission , these authors interpreted the velocity field and the spatial distribution of the molecular gas as evidence for an outflow entrained by a wide - angle radial wind , as modelled by shu et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1995 ) .",
    "the modelling of the position - velocity diagram of the emission along the jet is indeed in good agreement with the predictions of radial - wind driven outflows ( li & shu 1996 ) . as pointed out by cabrit et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , a simple fit to the position - velocity distribution of the outflowing gas does not allow to discriminate between jet - driven and wide - angle wind models , when the inclination with respect to the plane of the sky is low .",
    "we note that the physical conditions close to the source ( less than @xmath148 ) play an important role in constraining the parameters of the wide - angle wind fitted by nagar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . as can be seen on their fig .  5",
    ", it appears that at larger distances the radius of the cavity is constant rather than parabolic - like , as claimed by the authors , and the match between the observed velocity profile and the fit is less satisfying .    in our opinion",
    ", the strong ejection activity near the source prevents conclusions about the role of a wide - angle wind in driving molecular gas , as these ejecta are very efficient at transferring momentum to the ambient material .",
    "interferometric observations at a higher angular resolution than the data presented here are required to investigate the relation the optical shocked knots hold to the molecular gas , and how the dynamics of the cavity is affected .",
    "however , the formation of the large - scale cavity observed up to bow shock p is well explained in the frame of the model of rc93 .",
    "the jet entrains ambient molecular material swept - up in the propagation of bow shocks , which disturb the ambient gas at large distances from the jet axis .",
    "our observations indicate that bow shock v played a major role in shaping the global cavity .",
    "our observations of the co 7 - 6 emission bring evidence for hot outflowing gas in the cavity which is missed by observations of the low - j transitions , due to the extremely low opacity of the latter .",
    "this is evidenced by the maximum radial velocity detected in the outflow wings in the   and  transitions ( @xmath82 and @xmath230 , respectively ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to take into account the thermal structure of the outflow to discriminate between the various gas acceleration mechanisms that have been proposed .",
    "the hot gas component occupies probably a much smaller region than the low - velocity cold gas , with a typical size of the emitting region of a few arcsec .",
    "the emission likely arises from shocked gas in the jet , a conclusion supported by the high velocities and temperature measured in this gas .",
    "high signal : noise spectra obtained further downstream in the jet show a continuous velocity distribution between the molecular jet and the high - velocity wings , and support a close association between both phenomena .",
    "[ ci ] observations do not show any evidence of co dissociation close to the source ; hence , the gas is probably accelerated in c - type , rather than j - type shocks , along the jet .    averaging the co  signal over",
    "the cavity reveals a faint molecular jet signature at @xmath231 , consistent with the velocity of the molecular features ( bullets ) detected further downstream ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the presence of such a hot component shows that there is no clear velocity separation between the outflowing gas and the jet itself ( see fig .  4 , and lower panel of fig .  1 in cr ) .",
