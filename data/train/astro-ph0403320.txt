    "the discovery in the mid 1960s of rapid variability in extragalactic radio sources @xcite appeared difficult to explain in terms of conventional synchrotron radiation theory .",
    "these early observations showed changes by as much as 25 percent over a few weeks as well as significant day - to - day variations @xcite .",
    "it was quickly realized ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that the observed rapid variability implied such small linear dimensions , that the relativistic electron population would be rapidly extinguished by inverse compton scattering .",
    "later , @xcite put these arguments on a quantitative observational basis showing that due to inverse compton cooling , the maximum sustainable brightness temperature for an incoherent source of electron synchrotron radiation is less than @xmath3  k.    however , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that if there is relativistic bulk motion of the emitting material , since the radiation is then beamed along the direction of motion , the apparent luminosity in that direction is enhanced , while at the same time the cross - section for inverse compton scattering is reduced . additionally ,",
    "since the radiating source nearly catches up with its radiation , for a favorably positioned observer , the apparent transverse motion can exceed the speed of light .",
    "early vlbi observations @xcite showed evidence for the predicted high - velocity outflow ; however , the arguments were indirect , and one had to have faith in the interpretation of the very limited radio interferometric data which did not fully sample the source structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent higher quality vlbi observations confirmed the existence of superluminal motion in the well - collimated radio jets , found in the nuclei of many quasars as well as in nearby active galaxies @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations provide a direct method to investigate aspects of the formation , acceleration , and propagation of extragalactic radio jets .",
    "early studies discussing apparent jet speeds were statistically unreliable because they were largely based on the analysis of published observations of only a few tens of sources made at different times , often at only two or three epochs , by different groups , using different antenna array configurations , and different observing / data reduction strategies .",
    "the dynamic range of the images was often inadequate to identify individual features , especially for the more complex sources , and spacings in time between successive observations were frequently too long to uniquely identify and track moving jet features from epoch to epoch .",
    "moreover , the source selection criteria for many previously published studies of superluminal motion were not well defined .",
    "a systematic study by @xcite of 81 sources from the flux density limited 6  cm caltech - jodrell bank survey indicated smaller typical speeds than in earlier reports .",
    "this suggested that earlier studies preferentially tended to observe and/or report only sources in which rapid motion was detected or suspected .    in 1994",
    "we began a systematic 15  ghz vlba survey of relativistic outflows in a sample of over one hundred quasar and active galaxy radio jets .",
    "our motivation was to study the distributions of velocities , bending , pattern motions , accelerations , and other complexities of the jet kinematics that may exist , as well as changes in the strength and morphology of features as they propagate along the jet .",
    "these observations have provided the homogeneity , resolution and dynamic range to reliably distinguish and identify individual components between different epochs .",
    "the central vlba antennas provide short interferometric spacings that have allowed us to a ) track features moving for some distance down the jet where they become more diffuse , and b ) observe the continuous jet rather than just the bright features which are often referred to as `` components '' or `` blobs '' .",
    "we chose 15  ghz as a compromise between achieving the best angular resolution , and the better sensitivity and immunity from weather conditions found at lower frequencies . at this observing frequency",
    "the resolution of the vlba is approximately 0.5  mas in right ascension and between 0.5 and 1  mas in declination .",
    "we therefore have sufficient angular resolution in many cases to resolve the 2-dimensional jet transverse to its flow , which allows for tests of some theoretical models .",
    "also , individual features can often be recognized at significantly smaller separations from the origin . on the other hand ,",
    "our observations are less sensitive to structure and motions of the more diffuse features located far out along the jet or within 0.5  mas of the core .",
    "our 15  ghz data represent a significant improvement over previous studies of superluminal motion in agn .",
    "first , our sample of sources is large , and the sample membership was based on criteria other than observed superluminal motion .",
    "second , the speeds are better determined because a ) our data are well - sampled and span a longer time period , and b ) our higher image resolution results in less blending of features .    in paper i of this series @xcite , we described the parsec - scale structure of 132 of the strongest known radio jets based on a single epoch of observation . in paper ii",
    "@xcite we discussed the structure of an additional 39 sources .",

    "we discuss our multi - epoch observations made through 15  march 2001 and the kinematics derived from these observations .",
    "some preliminary results of our program have already been published ( @xcite ) .",

    "catalog is complete only at 5  ghz , we used other measurements at 15  ghz or extrapolations from lower frequencies to augment the khr sample .    while we attempted to be complete for flat - spectrum , core - dominated sources which met our selection criteria , we also included a number of other sources of special interest as follows :    \\a ) six compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources as indicated in table  [ sample ] .",
    "these sources generally have steep radio spectra and angular sizes smaller than @xmath11 on the sky .",
    "\\b ) four lobe - dominated sources with core components that would satisfy our criteria if they did not also have strong extended steep spectrum structure .",
    "two other sources , ngc1052 ( 0238@xmath12084 ) and 3c120 ( 0430 + 052 ) , also have prominent double lobe structure , but since they are core - dominated on arcsecond scales at 15  ghz , they met our spectral index selection criterion .",
    "\\c ) ten gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources , some of which have two - sided jet structure ( @xcite ; m.  l.  lister et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "however , many of the gps sources we observed turned out to be merely flat - spectrum sources whose spectrum was temporarily dominated by a bright , synchrotron self - absorbed component in the jet .",
    "our `` peaked '' classification in table  [ sample ] is given only to sources that to our knowledge have always met the gps spectral criteria given by @xcite .",
    "for a few sources , our classification differs from that previously published ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however we believe that our classification is more robust ( @xcite and y.  y.  kovalev et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "table  [ sample ] summarizes the properties of each source discussed in this paper .",
    "all of these sources were introduced in papers i and ii ; however , 37 sources included in papers i and ii are not discussed now because they were observed only once or twice .",
    "these have subsequently been observed and will be discussed in a separate paper ( e.  ros et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "one source listed in paper  i is gravitationally lensed ( 0218 + 357 ) , so we have chosen not to include it in our statistical discussion .",
    "eight other sources had no detectable jet above our sensitivity limit .",
    "they are labeled as `` naked cores '' in table  [ sample ] and we report no motions for these sources .",
    "three sources , 0316 + 162 , 1328 + 254 , and 1328 + 307 reported in papers i or ii , are not discussed here as they have complex structure that we could not adequately image .",
    "columns 1 and 2 of table  [ sample ] give the iau source designation and where appropriate a commonly used alias .",
    "column 3 indicates whether or not the source is a member of the representative flux density limited sample that we describe in   [ subsample ] .",
    "the optical classification and redshift as given mainly by @xcite are given in columns 4 and 5 , respectively . in column 6",
    "we give a radio spectral classification for each source based on telescope observations of broad - band instantaneous spectra from 1 to 22  ghz as described by @xcite .",
    "these spectra are available on our web site .",
    "for a few sources not observed at the telescope , we used published ( non - simultaneous ) radio flux densities taken from the literature .",
    "we consider a radio spectrum to be `` flat '' if any portion of its spectrum in the range 0.6 to 22  ghz has a spectral index flatter than @xmath13 and steep if the radio spectral index is steeper than @xmath13 over this entire region .",
    "column 7 shows the parsec scale radio morphology taken from papers i and ii ; in column 8 the largest total flux density seen on any of our vlba images , and in column 9 an indication of whether or not the radio source is associated with a gamma - ray detection by egret .      the full sample of sources described in the previous section is useful for investigating jet kinematics in a cross - section of known agn classes .",
    "however , in order to compare with the theoretical predictions of relativistic beaming models , a well - defined sample selected on the basis of beamed ( not total ) flux density is needed .",
    "past surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) have attempted to accomplish this by means of a spectral flatness criterion .",
    "however , we found that this method eliminates some lobe - dominated active galaxies such as those described in   [ fullsample ] . also , we found that the extrapolated 15  ghz flux density based on non - simultaneous lower frequency measurements was often grossly in error , because of spectral curvature or variability .    we have therefore assembled a flux density - limited subsample from the full 15  ghz vlba survey by using our measured vlba flux densities as the main selection criterion .",
    "all sources that had a total clean vlba flux density exceeding 1.5  jy ( 2  jy for southern sources ) _ at any epoch since 1994 _ are included in this sub - sample .",
    "we excluded any sources that were observed on at least four occasions and never exceeded this limit . for survey sources with fewer than four vlba epochs , we estimated the vlba flux density at various epochs during this period using the source compactness and data from the flux density monitoring programs at the radio telescope @xcite or the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that this sub - sample , although flux density - limited , is not complete ; that is , there are additional compact sources that fulfill our selection criteria .",
    "this is partly due to the lack of a complete all - sky survey at 15  ghz , and also to the variable nature of agn .",
    "we have therefore identified a list of candidate sources from other recent high - frequency radio surveys , made since our original list was compiled in 1994 .",
    "these include the wmap survey @xcite , the vlba calibrator survey @xcite , observations @xcite , and the high - frequency peaker survey @xcite .",
    "we have made new vlba observations of these sources in order to assemble a complete flux - density limited , core - selected sample .",
    "there are 133 sources in this complete flux density limited sample , but so far we have multiple epoch observations and derived speeds for only 71 of these sources which we define as the representative sub - sample . for the purposes of the statistical analysis presented here",
    ", we consider our present sub - sample to be _ representative _ of a complete sample , since the general properties of the missing sources should not be substantially different from the whole . we have compared the 15  ghz luminosity distributions of our representative sub - sample and the missing sources from the full sample using a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( k  s ) test , and find no significant difference between the two samples .",
    "although our sub - sample selection method is somewhat complex , it is based on the directly - measured compact flux density , and does not use an often unreliable spectral index criterion . also ,",
    "since the survey membership is not determined from a single `` snapshot '' epoch , we are not excluding potentially interesting or highly variable sources simply because they happened to be in a low state at the time of the original investigation .",
    "this increases the size of the sample and the robustness of statistical tests on source properties .",
    "of the 71 sources in our representative sub - sample , there are 53 quasars , 12 bl  lac objects , and 6 galaxies .",
    "our observations were made during 29 separate observing sessions between 1994 and 2001 .",
    "typically , we obtained images of each source at three to seven epochs over this seven year period .",
    "sources were usually observed at 6 to 18 month intervals .",
    "those with known rapid motion were observed more frequently , while those with no observed jet or with only small observed motions were observed less often .",
    "each observing session lasted between 8 and 24 hours .",
    "in general we tried to observe only at elevations above @xmath14 to minimize the effect of tropospheric absorption , phase errors , and excessive ground radiation . except for sources at low declinations , where the hour angle coverage is restricted ,",
    "we observed each source once per hour for six to eight minutes over a range of eight hours in hour angle .",
    "in general , all ten vlba antennas were used for each observations , except when restricted by elevation .",
    "we rarely used less than 8 antennas .",
    "papers i and ii , as well as our web site , give logs of the observations .    some additional observations were made in 1998 and 1999 by l.  i.gurvits et al .",
    "( in preparation ) as part of a different program to compare 15  ghz source structure measured with the vlba to the 5  ghz structure measured using the japanese _ halca _ space vlbi satellite @xcite",
    ". we have used these data to supplement our own as the observations were made using the same observing and data reduction procedures as used for the present program .",
    "these images are also available on our web site .",
    "data reduction was done using a combination of aips and difmap as described in paper i. each image was analyzed using the aips tasks jmfit or maxfit to determine the relative positions of each definable feature at each epoch , and these positions were then used to calculate velocities relative to a presumed core component .",
    "we have assumed that the bright unresolved feature typically found at the end of so - called core - jet sources is the stationary core .",
    "generally , the choice of the core is clear due to its high brightness temperature and location .",
    "however , in a few cases , the location of the core is ambiguous , particularly in some sources where the component motions appear two - sided about a centrally - located core . as an aid in identifying components from one epoch to the next we examined each image for continuity in position , flux density , and structure .",
    "usually , this procedure is more reliable than fitting independent models to the ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) data at each epoch , and with the possible exception of a few isolated cases , we believe that we have correctly cross - identified features as they evolve from epoch to epoch .",
    "however , for those sources where the jet is barely resolved from the vlba core , we fit models to the data in the ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) plane in order to exploit the full interferometric resolution of the vlba .    in figures  1 and  [ cso ]",
    "we show the angular motion in the jets of the 120 sources for which we have been able to determine motions with three or more epochs of observation . of these 120 sources , there are 110 sources with good quality data and measured redshifts for which we have been able to determine the linear velocity of at least one jet feature .",
    "these comprise 13 active galaxies , 79 quasars , and 18 bl  lac objects . in all",
    ", we have been able to determine reliable values for 208 separate features found in these 110 jets .",
    "we have determined the radial angular speed , @xmath17 , of each definable jet feature using a linear least squares fit to the measured component positions , relative to the presumed core .",
    "our measured values of @xmath17 are given in table  [ motions ] .",
    "in figures  1 and  [ cso ] the slope of the line corresponds to the best fitting least squares fit to the speed which is shown in column 6 of table  [ motions ] .",
    "figure  1 shows the plots for the one - sided jets and figure  [ cso ] the two - sided ones . for well - defined components the formal uncertainty in the relative position is small , generally less than 0.02  milliarcseconds ( mas )",
    "frequently , however , the jets have a complex brightness distribution with regions of enhanced intensity that can brighten and fade with time . in some sources , instead of a well - collimated jet",
    ", there is a broad plume or more complex two dimensional structure .",
    "not only is the centroid of these components poorly defined , but changes in the brightness distribution with time complicate the definition of their motion .",
    "some features appear to move ; while others appear stationary .",
    "some may break up into two or more separate features , and it is often unclear how these moving features are related to the underlying relativistic flow . in some sources ,",
    "the moving features are not well resolved from each other , especially when they are close to the core .",
    "these issues all affect our ability to make a unique identification of components from epoch to epoch . in a few cases where there are fast moving components",
    ", our observations may be too widely spaced in time to uniquely define their speed .",
    "ambiguities exist , but we believe that most of our component identifications are robust and that component speeds are reliably determined .",
    "we have based our error estimates of the angular velocity on the dispersion about the best - fit linear relation between the measured feature positions and time .",
    "the accuracy of each fit depends on the strength and size of the feature , the number of epochs , and the range of time covered by the observations .",
    "we note , however , that the measured dispersion of points about the best - fit line will overestimate the true scatter in component positions if there is acceleration such as observed for 3c279 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the measured radial speed may be an underestimate of the true speed if there is a significant non - radial component to the motion .",
    "however , we show in   [ non - radial - bent ] that while non - radial motions are common , the vector speeds do not differ significantly from the radial speeds , except in the case of 1548 + 056 .",
    "we use the following criteria to classify the quality of each measured velocity .    * the component position is determined at four or more observations . *",
    "the component is a well - defined feature whose position can be unambiguously determined to a small fraction of the vlba beamwidth . *",
    "the best fitting angular speed is determined to high accuracy , defined by an uncertainty @xmath18  mas per year or a significance requirement is necessary to accommodate nearby sources with very high angular speed features which may have large absolute uncertainties .",
    "] @xmath19 .",
    "we then assign a `` quality code '' to each component motion as follows .",
    "* e ( excellent ) denotes motions that satisfy all three of the above criteria . *",
    "g ( good ) denotes motions that satisfy any two of the above criteria . *",
    "f ( fair ) denotes motions that satisfy only one of the above criteria . *",
    "p ( poor ) denotes motions that do not satisfy any of the above criteria , or that the uncertainty in the fitted speed is @xmath20  mas per year ( except for the @xmath19 cases described above ) .",
    "these codes and the measured proper motions are tabulated in table  [ motions ] .",
    "we interpret the structural changes seen in the agn of our sample in terms of the twin relativistic jet model of @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the bulk velocity of the relativistic flow , in units of the speed of light , @xmath2 , is usually denoted as @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the corresponding lorentz factor defined by @xmath23 . for a jet flow at an angle @xmath24 to the observer s line of sight , the doppler factor , @xmath25 ,",
    "is given by @xmath26 .",
    "three important observational consequences of relativistic motion in synchrotron sources are :    \\a ) a doppler frequency shift of the radiation , where the ratio of observed frequency , @xmath27 , to the emitted frequency @xmath28 is given by @xmath29    \\b ) a change in the observed transverse velocity due to the apparent time compression . the apparent transverse velocity , in units of @xmath2 , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pattern velocity .",
    "we make this distinction between pattern and bulk velocities because jet features can move with significantly different velocity than the bulk jet flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". this could be the case , for example , if the pattern motion is due to the propagation of shocks . by studying 25 core - dominated quasars selected from the literature",
    ", @xcite showed that the simplest model , which has only one value of @xmath32 that is the same in all sources and also has @xmath33 in all sources , is not tenable .",
    "they showed that either there must be a distribution of @xmath32 among the sources ; or that @xmath34 .",
    "most likely , there is both some distribution of @xmath32 , and also a difference between @xmath35 and @xmath22    the apparent transverse velocity of an approaching component with a pattern lorentz factor @xmath35 , reaches a maximum apparent speed @xmath36 when the component moves at an angle @xmath37 to the line of sight . for the corresponding component in the receding jet ,",
    "the observed velocity is @xmath38 .",
    "\\c ) a change in the apparent flux density , @xmath39 , of a moving component over its stationary value , @xmath40 , by a factor @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spectral index and @xmath43 has a value of 2 for a continuous jet or 3 for discrete components ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the doppler factor is sharply peaked along the direction of motion , so sources with highly relativistic jets that happen to be pointed close to the line of sight will appear strongly boosted , and hence likely to be selected in a flux - limited sample .",
    "although the jets may be intrinsically two - sided , unless they are very close to the plane of the sky , they will appear highly asymmetric ( i.e. , one - sided ) since the radiation from the receding jet is highly beamed away from the observer .",
    "equation ( [ eq_ss0 ] ) has the important consequence that the strongest , most compact radio sources we observe tend to have highly relativistic jets that are aligned close to the line of sight , and they will therefore likely display superluminal motion . the most probable angle for sources selected on the basis of beamed flux density alone is close to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of observed speeds and flux densities is dependent on the distributions of @xmath32 , redshift , and the intrinsic luminosity function .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ rene ] where we show the predicted distribution of apparent velocities for three different models .",
    "if the effect of doppler boosting is ignored ; for example , if the observed motions are due to the propagation of shocks rather than actual bulk motion , then most jets will lie close to the plane of the sky and have apparent speeds , @xmath46 close to @xmath47 .",
    "if we take into account the effect of doppler boosting , then , in a flux limited sample , with a single lorentz factor , most sources are found to lie close to the line of sight , and have an apparent velocity , @xmath48 . in the typical situation which we consider , where @xmath49 , then in the absence of doppler boosting , case most sources appear to have an apparent velocity close to @xmath2 , whereas in the doppler boosted case , most sources have an apparent velocity close to @xmath50 .",
    "note that in the absence of doppler boosting , there are virtually no sources with apparent speeds less than @xmath51 since this would require rare end - on orientations , the randomly oriented model also drops much more sharply with increasing @xmath52 than the model with a range of lorentz factors .",
    "@xcite suggested that one of the observed jet components might be the stationary feature of the approaching jet at the point where it becomes optically thin , so that the flux density of this `` core '' component as well as the moving component is doppler boosted .",
    "the observed overall spectrum is typically flat , which may due to the superposition of different parts of the jet , which each have different doppler factors , causing the synchrotron cutoff to appear at different frequencies .",
    "consideration of differential doppler boosting led to the concept of unified models ( e.g. , @xcite ) which is usually invoked to understand the observed differences in the properties of quasars , active galaxies , and bl  lac objects as due to the orientation of the relativistic beam and an obscuring torus with respect to the line of sight .",
    "thus comparison of apparent jet speeds with optical classification is an effective test of these unified models and also serves to refine their parameters .",
    "the motion statistics collected for our sample address many physical questions related to relativistic jets .",
    "the process of their formation , that is , the initial acceleration and collimation of the flow , may be constrained by studying the speeds as a function of distance from the beginning of the visible jet ( often referred to as the `` core '' ) , and also by comparing the times when flares occur with the back - extrapolated epochs at which moving features appear to originate .",
    "long - term multi - epoch observations can show whether there are accelerations or decelerations farther down the jets , and whether radio features follow straight or curved trajectories .    in order to discriminate between various jet models , and then to refine the relevant ones , it is important to establish whether jets exist as predefined channels , along which multiple moving features can be seen , or whether instead successive components follow different trajectories , at either the same or at different speeds .",
    "viable models of jet formation will also need to be able to reproduce the observed lorentz factor distribution .",
    "the moving features may in fact be patterns , caused by the propagation of shocks rather than the flow of matter .",
    "this can be studied by comparing the lorentz factors inferred from the motions to the lorentz factors estimated by other means , such as variability , brightness temperature , and ( possibly ) the presence of x - ray and gamma - ray emission . by probing for correlations between the apparent velocities and other quantities such as the radio or x - ray luminosity ,",
    "more can be learned about the physical parameters relevant for jet formation .",
    "finally , studying the distribution of velocities as a function of optical host type is relevant to constraining unification models .",
    "most of the jets in our study are well collimated and are unresolved transverse to their flow , although there often is significant curvature . in some radio galaxies with two sided structure ,",
    "the appearance of the source is very frequency dependent , suggesting free - free absorption in a disk or torus , probably associated with the accretion disk surrounding the central engine .",
    "we found several jet features to have apparent negative velocities ; that is , they appear to be approaching rather than receding from the core .",
    "most of these apparently negative velocities are consistent , within the errors , with no significant motion .",
    "observations extending over a longer time frame are needed to determine if these inward motions are real .",
    "apparent inward motion may be produced if there is a newly emerging jet feature that is ejected from the core , and the combination is not resolved by our beam .",
    "this would cause a shift in the measured position of the centroid and a corresponding decrease with time in the apparent separation of the core and other jet features .",
    "it is also possible that the true core is not seen , possibly due to absorption , and that the only observed features are parts of a jet which are moving with different velocities .",
    "if the furthest component is moving with a slower velocity than the one closest to the obscured core , then they will appear to be approaching each other .",
    "the apparent decrease in component separation from the core could also be due to component motion away from the core along a highly curved jet which bends back toward the line of sight , so that the projected separation from the core appears to decrease with time .",
    "finally , the moving features could be only patterns in the flow , some of which might even be moving backward .",
    "@xcite have discussed an electron - positron jet model where an observer located close to the direction of motion will see backward - moving knots .",
    "we note that any model involving patterns must account for the the very large numbers of observed outward motions , as opposed to inward ones .",
    "for this reason , many of the simplest `` moving marquee '' models for superluminal motion have already been ruled out . in the case of 0735 + 178",
    ", the most distant feature appears to be moving inward , but this is probably an artifact of the complex brightness distribution whose centroid shifts when the intensity distribution changes .",
    "figure  [ p3histall ] shows the distribution of the observed values of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the angular size distance to the radio source in megaparsecs and the angular velocity , @xmath17 , is in mas per year .",
    "figure  [ p3histmoj ] shows the same distributions for those jets found in the representative sub - sample described in   [ subsample ] .",
    "we include in these figures only those jet features which we have been able to measure with a quality code of ` e ' or ` g ' and which have measured redshifts .    the central and right - hand columns of figures  [ p3histall ] and [ p3histmoj ] show the motions of only one feature per source , the brightest and the fastest respectively .",
    "the brightest feature in each jet is defined as the one with the largest peak flux density at the epoch for which the source image was presented in papers i or ii , although in nearly all cases this does not change over the period covered by these observations .",

    ", we have substituted the brightest component which did have an ` e ' or ` g ' quality code . for the right - hand panel of figure  [ p3histall ] , the fastest feature within a source is simply defined as the one with the largest ( absolute ) linear speed with a quality code of either ` e ' or ` g ' .",
    "k  s tests indicate that at a 95 percent confidence level , there is no difference in the distribution of the jet speeds , independent of whether we consider the brightest , fastest , or even all the jet features within a source .",
    "we consider the brightest feature of each source to be the most representative for our analysis , since in the case of sources with weak secondary features , observations having a limited sensitivity or dynamic range might only detect the brightest jet feature .",
    "the distributions shown in figures  [ p3histall ] and [ p3histmoj ] are also sub - divided according to optical class .",
    "we find that the velocity distributions for the quasars , radio galaxies , and bl  lacs are mostly concentrated in the same range ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , the quasars have a tail ranging up to @xmath56 , while jets associated with active galaxies have a narrow range of velocities with @xmath57 .",
    "a k  s test confirms at the 98 percent confidence level that the quasars have a different speed distribution than the galaxies and bl  lac objects , while the distribution of speeds for the galaxies and bl lacs are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "examination of figure  [ p3histall ] and figure  [ p3histmoj ] suggests that the distribution of quasar velocities may be bi - modal with a minimum near @xmath58 .",
    "we have compared our observed distributions with one and two gaussian distributions and find in each case a significantly lower value of reduced @xmath59 for the two component distribution for all of the quasar distributions .",
    "however , we are reluctant to quantify this further , as the observed distributions are clearly more complex than can be represented by two gaussians .    we have also compared the dispersion in the speed of different features within each jet , with the dispersion of the average jet speeds .",
    "we find that the dispersion of the average jet speeds among the 50 sources with two or more features with quality factors e or g is 6.3@xmath2 , whereas in all but four jets ( 92 percent ) the dispersion in the speed of individual jet features is smaller than this value .",
    "this suggests that there is an underlying flow , characteristic of each jet , that determines the speed of individual features with the jet .",
    "figure  [ p3betalum ] shows the relation between @xmath46 on apparent vlba core luminosity at 15  ghz .",
    "there is a distinct upper envelope to the distribution , which is very similar to that found at 5  ghz in the caltech jodrell flat - spectrum survey by @xcite . in particular , the low - luminosity sources all have slow apparent speeds .",
    "if we divide the sources at the median luminosity of @xmath60  whz@xmath5 , a k  s test yields less than a 1% probability that speed distributions for the brightest components of the high and low luminosity sources have the same parent distribution .",
    "we note that if the apparent jet speeds that we are measuring are simply random patterns , then no envelope would be expected in figure  [ p3betalum ] .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the presence of this envelope does not necessarily imply that _ intrinsically _ faint jets have low _ intrinsic _ speeds . as discussed in ",
    "[ pgamma ] , in practice there is likely to be a spread in lorentz factors .",
    "the lowest - luminosity sources in a flux - limited sample will tend to lie at low redshifts , where the co - moving volume element is small . ignoring evolutionary effects and assuming a constant co - moving space density and a steep luminosity function",
    ", these sources will therefore be representative of the most common jets in the parent population .",
    "the probability of any of them having _ both _ a high lorentz factor and small viewing angle will be very small , especially if the parent population is dominated by low - lorentz factor jets ( i.e. , @xmath61 as found by @xcite ) .",
    "this may therefore explain why none of the low - luminosity sources in figure  [ p3betalum ] are highly superluminal .",
    "for most of the sources in our sample we have determined only the radial speed and position angle of the motion with respect to the assumed core component . for those sources with sufficiently high - quality data",
    ", we also computed the full two - dimensional vector proper motion on the sky .",
    "this was accomplished by fitting separately for the proper motion in both right ascension and declination .",
    "these results were combined to form a vector velocity , determined by the speed , @xmath17 , and the direction , @xmath62 , on the sky relative to the radio core .",
    "we are particularly interested in comparing the direction of motion , @xmath62 , to the mean structural position angle of the jet , @xmath63@xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "table  [ non - radial ] compiles the vector proper motions for all jet components in our sample which have at least five epochs of observation and for which the vector velocity is of at least @xmath66 significance .",
    "these criteria guarantee that only the highest quality vector motions are used in our comparison of velocity direction to structural position angle . of the 60 component motions that meet these criteria , we find that 20 are significantly `` non - radial '' , meaning the velocity direction , @xmath62 , differs by at least @xmath67 from the mean structural position angle , @xmath63@xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "these non - radial motions are high - lighted in bold in table  [ non - radial ] .",
    "non - radial motions do not follow a direction which extrapolates back to the jet origin and are by definition considered non - ballistic .",
    "the occurrence of such non - ballistic motions in approximately a third of the highest quality motions we examined is striking . assuming the observed velocities trace the underlying jet flow",
    ", this result indicates that bends in jet direction and/or jet collimation are common .",
    "the actual bends may be small , only a few degrees , but the observed bends can be large , of the order of @xmath68 , since they appear amplified by projection .    in figure  [ bent ] , we show tracks in the ra ",
    "dec plane of several sources that have clearly defined non - radial or bent trajectories . in general , the trajectories are bent toward the next structure down the jet , whether seen directly in our maps , or in published larger scale images .",
    "this suggests that jet features may trace out a flow in a pre - existing curved channel .",
    "1226@xmath69023 ( 3c273 ) , 1219@xmath69285 , 1532@xmath69016 , and 2200@xmath69420",
    "( bl  lac ) are excellent examples of this trend . in 1548@xmath69056",
    ", the component motion appears to be transverse to the main jet direction which is known from lower resolution images , and is hinted at in our images , to lie to the north .",
    "however , the motion we observe is directed toward the small extension toward the east , and looking back toward the core , the jet ridge - line appears to curve into the component from the opposite direction .    in 3c390.3 ( 1845@xmath69797 )",
    "the two most prominent features appear to be moving with a similar speed of about @xmath70 , but along slightly different trajectories of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . neither",

    "this is a clear exception to the trend identified above .",
    "in general we do not have sufficient data to robustly detect changes in velocity , although the high incidence of non - ballistic motion implies that such changes must occur .",
    "however , in bl  lac , there is evidence that the moving feature traces the curved ridge - line of the jet .",
    "also , we have previously reported an abrupt change in both speed and direction in 3c279 that occurred in 1998 @xcite .",
    "seven sources in table  [ motions ] display two - sided structure in which the jet flow appears bi - directional away from a central core .",
    "we have previously reported our results on the two - sided source ngc1052 @xcite , where the component motion is close to the plane of the sky and multiple components move in opposite directions from the core with a velocity , @xmath75 , which is only mildly relativistic .",
    "plots of component position vs time for all of the two sided jets are shown in figure  [ cso ] . for most of these sources",
    "we were able to identify the central component at each epoch and so determine the motion of individual features away from the center . in a few cases ,",
    "however , such as 1404 + 286 ( epochs 1998.83 and 1999.55 ) the central core was not detected at one or more epochs , either because it was weak , or because the dynamic range was limited for that observation . in these cases",
    "we have interpolated from the positions of the outer features , to find the `` virtual '' center , and we have used that to determine the motion of the individual outer features .",
    "for the source 1323 + 321 even that procedure was not possible since the structure appears to be two - sided , but we do not see the core at any epoch . moreover , our imaging of this source is not completely satisfactory due to its large angular size and the limited interferometer spacings sampled by our data .",
    "gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources are characterized by their sharp low frequency cutoff and general absence of prominent large scale structure .",
    "there is no consensus as to whether the observed spectral cutoff in these sources is due to synchrotron self absorption or to free - free absorption @xcite .",
    "previous vlbi observations have suggested that gps sources have a simple double structure morphology with little or no significant motions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thirteen of our sources are classified as gps sources of which we , so far , have observations of eight at three or more epochs . of these , only 1345 + 125 shows superluminal motion .",
    "the mean velocity observed for the gps sources in our sample is only ( @xmath76)@xmath2 .",
    "none of the gps sources have @xmath77 .",
    "the existence of a sharp peak in the spectra of these sources implies that the individual components each peak up at about the same frequency .",
    "this means that the different components probably have comparable doppler shifts , and if the spectral cutoff is due to synchrotron self absorption they should have comparable brightness temperatures .",
    "some gps sources , such as 0552 + 398 and 0642 + 449 contain a single unresolved strong component , and so an interpretation in terms of synchrotron self absorption is required for any reasonable magnetic field strength .",
    "however , for other gps sources we note the very different appearance of the core and jet components ; nevertheless , they have a common cutoff frequency .",
    "moreover , many of the peaked spectrum sources included in our study have sharply bent jet structure suggesting very different amounts of doppler boosting and frequency shift of the self absorption peak .",
    "free - free absorption probably plays an important role in determining the spectra of these sources . since many of the core - jet gps sources show little or no motion , we suggest that possibly , the jet flow in these sources is non - relativistic , or that these sources are seen at very large viewing angles , rather than that the measured velocity is the advance speed of a young double lobe radio galaxy as suggested by @xcite .",
    "either of these scenarios would imply a small doppler shift .",
    "gps sources do not have any extended double lobe structure which may be a consequence of the slow jets which do not carry sufficient energy to form extended radio lobes .",
    "we note that in some cases , such as cta102 which had a peaked spectrum in the past , there are large variations in the total flux density @xcite which probably reflects significant relativistic boosting . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have argued that these sources are not bona fide gps sources but `` masquerading blazars '' which often contain bright transient jet features that dominate their radio spectrum .      as a result of our selection criteria ,",
    "most of the sources included in our study are dominated by their flat spectrum compact structure ; they are mostly identified with quasars .",
    "some quasars , however , also have extended structure with relatively steep radio spectra , in addition to their flat spectrum compact core .",
    "we have included a few of these lobe - dominated sources in our study , although they did not meet our selection criteria .",
    "extended structure is more common among the active galaxies .",

    "all are identified with galaxies containing a relatively strong agn .",
    "all but ngc1052 and 3c120 are dominated by the extended steep spectrum double lobe structure even at 15  ghz . in the framework of standard relativistic beaming models , radio galaxies and lobe - dominated sources",
    "are presumed to lie close to the plane of the sky , and thus should show values of @xmath78 .",
    "however , 3c111 , 3c120 , and 3c390.3 each show rather large apparent motions , and it is not clear how they fit into standard unification models .",
    "these objects are all broad - line radio galaxies ( blrg ) , although 3c120 has also been classified as a narrow - line radio galaxy ( nlrg ) .",
    "the nlrg are thought to lie at rather large angles to the line of sight , and polarimetry shows that in some cases they contain a central quasar and a broad line region that are hidden by a dusty torus .",
    "the nlrg do not show strong superluminal motion .",
    "3c111 , 3c120 , and 3c390.3 do show superluminal motion and hence must be at small angles to the line of sight ( less than about @xmath79 for 3c 111 ) .",
    "the blrg are not well - understood , and they may have a wide range of intrinsic luminosity and orientation@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the jets of other lobe - dominated sources appear to be sub - relativistic .",
    "the powerful radio galaxy cygnus  a contains twin jets pointed toward the distant hot spots .",
    "the approaching and receding jets appear to propagate with velocities of @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively , and we find relatively slow speeds of ( @xmath82)@xmath2 in the parsec scale jet of ngc315 . in the case of the radio galaxy ngc1052 ,",
    "we have reported a two - sided flow with sub - relativistic jet speeds of only @xmath83 @xcite on both sides of the core . at least in these radio galaxies , the intrinsic jet flow close to the core appears to have only moderate speeds with @xmath84 .",
    "thus , it appears that the observed distribution of speeds and/or degree of jet asymmetry can not be interpreted simply in terms of the orientation of a twin relativistic jet with @xmath85 , unless the observed speeds do not reflect that actual jet flow speed , or the radiation from a high speed inner spine is not observed due to a more slowly moving outer sheath that dominates the emission at large angles from the jet direction . as we show in   [ flux ] highly relativistic jets are relatively rare among the general population of radio jets .      other recent vlba monitoring observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) made at other wavelengths with different resolution and with different sampling intervals are complementary to our observations and may be used to extend the range of size and time scales over which jet kinematics may be studied .",
    "@xcite have used the vlba to study the motions in a sample of strong sources at 7  mm and 13  mm .",
    "these observations probe the source structure and motions on a scale about three times smaller than our 2  cm observations , but due to the decreased surface brightness at 7  mm , they are generally not able to trace the motions beyond a few milliarcseconds from the core . from the comparison of the observed motions for the sources in common to our two studies , it is possible to trace the motions of individual components over a wider range of scales than is possible from either set of observations alone .",
    "we have compared our velocities determined at 15  ghz with those of @xcite .",
    "there appears to be little agreement in the individual source speeds found by the two studies . on average , the @xcite speeds appear systematically higher , possibly because their observations were carried out at shorter wavelengths and probed jet regions closer to the core .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have discussed jet motions in a large sample of sources at 6  cm , taken from the caltech - jodrell cj surveys covering declinations greater than @xmath86 .",
    "these observations have lower angular resolution than ours , and are thus more sensitive to the lower surface brightness structure located downstream .",
    "@xcite quote a mean velocity for quasar and galaxy jets of @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "this appears be less than the values of ( @xmath89)@xmath2 and ( @xmath90)@xmath2 which we measure at 2  cm for the brightest features in each source . on the other hand , @xcite , working primarily at 0.7 and 1.3  cm , find systematically faster velocities in those sources where our samples overlap .",
    "these results suggest that there is a systematic decrease in @xmath46 with increasing wavelength , probably because the observations at different wavelengths , sample different parts of jet structure . in a separate paper ( r.  c.  vermeulen et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will discuss , in more detail , the motions of those sources in common to the 6 and 2  cm samples .",
    "the simplest model to consider is a pure ballistic model with a common flow velocity for all sources , with @xmath91 ; and a flow which is intrinsically symmetric . in this simple case ,",
    "observations of the apparent velocities , and the ratio of flux densities of approaching and receding components , can , in principle , be used to solve uniquely for @xmath32 and @xmath24 and thus provide a test of the hypothesis that @xmath92 .",
    "however even early vlbi data indicated that this simple model is not tenable ( @xcite ) .    in a flux density - limited sample , the combined effect of available solid angle and doppler boosting leads to a distribution of @xmath46 with many values close to @xmath32 @xcite . on the other hand , if doppler boosting is not an important selection mechanism , then in most cases @xmath93 1 .",
    "figure  [ rene ] shows the expected distribution of apparent velocities for the case where @xmath94 ( see   [ beaming ] ) along with the corresponding distribution for a randomly oriented sample .",
    "none of the distributions shown in figure  [ p3histall ] or figure  [ p3histmoj ] are consistent with either of these simple ballistic models as there is neither evidence for the peak at @xmath95 characteristic of the simple doppler boosted models , nor for the sharp low speed cutoff at @xmath78 characteristic of models which ignore doppler boosting .    how do we reconcile the difference between the observed and predicted distributions ? either there must be spread in intrinsic velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a difference between the bulk flow velocity and the pattern velocity , so that there is less doppler bias in favor of observing beams which are oriented close to the critical angle @xcite . in figure  [ rene ] , we plot a model with a spread of intrinsic velocity such that @xmath96 .",
    "this model has equal pattern and bulk velocities , and reproduces the general characteristics of the observed distribution of superluminal speeds .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be discussed by m.  l.  lister et al .",
    "( in preparation )",
    ".      based on earlier observations of apparent velocity distributions @xcite suggested that the simple model with no doppler bias , provided an adequate fit to the observed distributions of @xmath46 with only a slight adjustment needed which was satisfied by introducing an obscuring torus .",
    "however , comparison of our data with models which do not include doppler boosting shows poor agreement , since , as shown in figure  [ rene ] , in the absence of doppler boosting , most sources are expected to lie close to the plane of the sky where @xmath78 .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with the tail of the velocity distribution which we find extending toward larger apparent velocities . following the discussion of @xcite",
    "a detailed analysis of the observed velocities shows that the probability of the sources having been picked at random from a parent population that is isotropically distributed is less than @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sources are preferentially aligned along the line of sight , as would be expected if doppler boosting is in fact important .",
    "while the actual observation of superluminal motion in radio source jets remains the most direct way of establishing the existence of relativistic motion , comparison of the observed values of @xmath46 with other velocity indicators also provides important tests of beaming models and specifically the relation between pattern and bulk flow speeds .",
    "this includes flux density variability ( @xcite ) , maximum brightness temperature ( @xcite ) , the ratio of core - to - extended radio luminosity ( @xcite ) , the gamma - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) , or observations of inverse compton x - rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "relativistic boosting also affects the radio source counts and luminosity functions ( @xcite ) which provide a consistency check on beaming models .",
    "flux density changes are commonly seen in superluminal sources , and their short time scale is generally taken to imply high brightness temperatures . the variability time scale , and the time scale for apparent transverse motion , are both compressed due to the forward motion , and hence we might expect to see a relation between @xmath46 and the flux density variability provided that @xmath21 is related to @xmath47 . @xcite used variability data at 1.3  cm and 8  mm from the metshovi observatory to calculate a variability doppler factor , @xmath98 , assuming an intrinsic brightness temperature characteristic of a self - absorbed synchrotron source in which the particle and magnetic energy are in equilibrium .",
    "we have recalculated their values using the cosmology given in   [ intro ] and for different values of intrinsic brightness temperature .",
    "since @xmath98 varies inversely as the cube root of the assumed intrinsic temperature in the synchrotron plasma , @xmath99 , @xmath98 is relatively insensitive to the assumed value of @xmath99 .    in figure",

    "five sources which only have components located at a bend in the jet were excluded , as they probably reflect a standing shock wave , or perhaps a stationary location in a helical jet where the flow is closest to the line of sight , and hence is boosted most strongly . in either case the measured velocity is a poor indicator of the flow velocity , and not relevant in discussing relativistic effects .",
    "the sample we use contains 5 active galaxies , 14 bl lacs , and 30 quasars .",
    "most points lie inside the `` @xmath102 cone '' ( @xmath103 ) as they should for a flux desnity limited sample @xcite .",
    "@xcite have compared figure  [ cohen ] with the results of a simulation generated by randomly picking a flux - limited sample from an isotropically distributed population with power law distributions of luminosity and @xmath32 and for several values of @xmath99 over the range @xmath104 to @xmath105  k. @xmath106  k gives the best fit between the measured and simulated data . however , although there does appear to be an upper limit to @xmath46 that is close to the expected locus for components with @xmath107 , the detailed distribution is not well - matched to that expected from the simulation @xcite .",
    "calculations of the variability doppler factor using values of @xmath99 closer to the inverse compton limit , @xmath108  k , lead to distributions on the @xmath109@xmath110 plane that are very different from those expected from the simulations .",

    "slower - moving components , especially those located at a bend in the jet , may be dominated by standing shock waves .",
    "forward shock waves might also exist , and trying to understand their role is a goal of our study .",
    "other geometries have been suggested for the jet , including a fast `` spine '' which we would preferentially see , surrounded by a slower shell . in this case , the spine would probably also control the flux variations , so that using the fastest ( spine ) velocity for @xmath46 is appropriate .",
    "we have also examined values of @xmath98 calculated from the data base at our wavelength of 2  cm , and noted a large dispersion between doppler factors deduced from these data and the shorter wavelength metshovi data .",
    "thus , the robustness of the doppler factors calculated in this way appears to be uncertain .",
    "the michigan data cover a longer time span , but are at longer wavelengths where individual outbursts appear to overlap in time .    the lorentz factor",
    ", @xmath32 , in a superluminal jet is important , because it is intrinsic to the jet , whereas @xmath46 and @xmath98 are the observables that depend on the jet orientation .",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 may give information on the physics of the collimation region .",
    "from the values of @xmath46 and @xmath25 shown in figure  [ cohen ] we calculate the actual lorentz factors , shown as a histogram in figure  [ cohenhist ] .",
    "we believe that the apparent deficit in the first bin of figure  [ cohenhist ] for the quasars , may be a selection effect or just due to small number statistics . to be fully consistent with the analysis above , and the choice @xmath111  k , the lorentz factors should have a power - law distribution .",
    "however , the number of objects is too small , and the errors are too uncertain , to make a meaningful comparison .",
    "a small lorentz factor implies a low velocity and small flux density variations , and the latter especially is less likely to be measurable .",
    "however , the calculated lorentz factors are useful in showing that there must be a wide range of @xmath32 in the superluminal sources .",
    "the galaxies all have rather low lorentz factors , while the quasars have a broad distribution up to @xmath112 .",
    "many of the sources included in our study have been cataloged as strong gamma - ray sources according to measurements made by the egret detector on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "it is generally thought that the gamma - ray emission occurs deep within the relativistic jet .",
    "arguments based on size limits deduced from time variability and the cross section for pair production suggest that the gamma - ray emission , like the radio emission , is doppler boosted @xcite .",
    "in fact , the gamma - rays may be even more strongly beamed than the radio emission since the former generally have a steeper spectral index , @xmath42 , and the flux density boosting varies as @xmath113 for continuous jets .",
    "also , @xcite has shown that if the bulk of the gamma - rays are produced by external compton scattering off photons associated with the accretion disk , the resulting gamma - ray emission will be boosted by an additional factor of @xmath114 .",
    "if gamma - ray loud agn do indeed have systematically high doppler factors , then we might expect to see a different apparent speed distribution for them than for agn that have not been detected in gamma - rays .",
    "the situation is complicated by the possibility that the gamma - ray loud jets may be seen inside the critical angle for maximizing superluminal motion , ( @xmath102 radians ) , and therefore might have slow apparent projected speeds .",
    "however , monte carlo simulations based on a simple linear relationship between radio and gamma - ray luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) confirm that in a flux density limited radio sample , agn detected by egret should have typically higher speeds than those that were not detected in gamma - rays .",
    "@xcite recently measured the apparent speeds of 33 egret - detected agn .",
    "they found a mean value of @xmath115 for the fastest component in each source and concluded that the gamma - ray sources have larger lorentz factors than the general population of radio sources .",
    "however , @xcite did not have a non - gamma - ray control sample observed in the same way and at the same wavelength with which to compare their results .",
    "we have classified our sample into egret and non - egret sources based on the list of @xcite and recently modified by @xcite .",

    "re - classifying them as non - detections sources had no effect on our results , and neither did excluding the sources with negative velocities from our analysis .",

    "an early version of this plot @xcite was used to show that the standard paradigm for superluminal motion provided a crude upper bound to the points in figure  [ muzfig ] , and that the maximum value of @xmath46 in 32 sources was about 13 ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) .",
    "the @xmath118 line in figure  [ muzfig ] is , similarly , a crude upper bound to the measured points , and shows that @xmath123 .",
    "note that the cosmology used in this paper makes @xmath46 somewhat larger than for a cosmology with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the data in @xcite were compiled at assorted frequencies , mostly below 15  ghz , and corresponded to measurements made at different distances from the core which may explain the difference in @xmath126 . as we have discussed in ",
    "[ othervels ] there is some evidence that observations at high frequencies give higher values of @xmath17 than lower frequencies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that , if doppler boosting is important , then even rather small samples of superluminal sources will show @xmath126 near the maximum value of the distribution of @xmath32 , @xmath127 .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath128 for the sample shown in figure  [ muzfig ] .",
    "this is marginally consistent with figure  [ cohenhist ] , reflecting that lorentz factors calculated according to the method in   [ flux ] have rather large uncertainties .",
    "we have studied the kinematics of a large well - defined sample of 110 quasar and active galaxy jets and find a distribution of apparent velocities typically between 0 and @xmath129 but ranging up to about @xmath1 .",
    "there is evidence for a characteristic velocity in each jet which may represent the true plasma flow velocity .",
    "we have found that quasar jets generally have larger apparent velocities than jets associated with bl  lac objects and active galaxies , although the distributions overlap .",
    "our measured values of @xmath46 are consistent with the doppler factors , @xmath98 , calculated from time variability and a parent population having a steep power law distribution of intrinsic lorentz factors extending down to moderate velocities and an intrinsic brightness temperature close to @xmath130  k. this is close to the value expected if the particle and magnetic energy densities in the jet are comparable ( @xcite )    in approximately one - third of the well studied jets , we find evidence for non - ballistic motion ; that is the flow is not along the direction away from the core . in most of the jets",
    ", we find no deviation from a constant speed ; but in a few sources , we do see evidence for changes in speed and direction of individual features .",
    "mostly , the flow appears to lie along the direction of the local jet orientation .",
    "however , in some cases the flow has a significant non - radial component , which points toward more distant parts of the jet .",
    "this suggests that there is a continuous flow along a pre - existing channel .",
    "contrary to the assumption of the simple unified models , in some jets , the intrinsic flow appears to be with speeds much less than @xmath2 .",
    "observations made at higher frequencies sample jet features located closer to the core , and they typically show larger apparent velocities than we observe at 15  ghz , while lower frequency observations show yet smaller speeds .",
    "sources with stable gps spectra show little or no motion ; the jet flow in these sources may be non - relativistic or lie in the plane of the sky with a correspondingly small doppler shift .",
    "we find that jets of quasars which have been observed as strong gamma - ray sources have marginally higher speeds than those which are not gamma - ray sources .",
    "this is consistent with models where the gamma - ray sources have more highly relativistic jets and are aligned closer to the line of sight .",
    "however , our analysis is limited by both small number statistics , and the uncertainties in the ever changing analysis of the egret catalogs .",
    "also , with the limited range of flux density observed by egret , there is no well defined class of gamma - ray loud and gamma - ray quiet sources analogous to the radio loud and radio quiet classifications .",
    "more sensitive observations with the next generation of gamma - ray observatories , such as _ glast _ , combined with jet speed data for our complete radio sample of 133 radio sources , should be very useful for investigating gamma - ray production mechanisms in agn jets and relating the gamma - ray properties to the observed jet outflow .",

    "<S> we report the results of a 15  ghz ( 2  cm ) multi - epoch vlba program , begun in 1994 to study the outflow in radio jets ejected from quasars and active galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the observed flow of 208 distinct features measured in 110 quasars , active galaxies , and bl  lac objects shows highly collimated relativistic motion with apparent transverse velocities typically between zero and about @xmath0 , with a tail extending up to about @xmath1 . within individual jets , </S>",
    "<S> different features appear to move with a similar characteristic velocity which may represent an underlying continuous jet flow , but we also see some stationary and even apparently inward moving features which co - exist with the main features . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of our observations with published data at other wavelengths suggests that there is a systematic decrease in apparent velocity with increasing wavelength , probably because the observations at different wavelengths sample different parts of the jet structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed distribution of linear velocities is not consistent with any simple ballistic model . either there is a rather broad range of lorentz factors , a significant difference between the velocity of the bulk relativistic flow and the pattern speed of underlying shocks , or a combination of these options . assuming a ballistic flow , comparison of observed apparent velocities and doppler factors computed from the time scale of flux density variations is consistent with a steep power law distribution of intrinsic lorentz factors , an isotropic distribution of orientations of the parent population , and intrinsic brightness temperatures about an order of magnitude below the canonical inverse compton limit . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the parent population of radio jets is not dominated by highly relativistic flows , and contrary to the assumption of simple unified models , not all sources have intrinsic speeds close to @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> usually , the observed jet flow is in the general direction of an established jet . </S>",
    "<S> however , many jets show significant bends and twists , where the observed motions are non - radial , but are alingned with the local jet direction suggesting that the jet flow occurs along pre - existing bent channels . in a few cases we have observed a clear change in the direction of a feature as it flows along the jet . </S>",
    "<S> radio jets which are also strong gamma - ray sources detected by egret appear to have significantly faster speeds than the non egret sources , consistent with the idea that gamma ray sources have larger doppler factors than non gamma - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> sources at high redshift have systematically lower angular speeds than low redshift jets , consistent with standard cosmologies . </S>"
