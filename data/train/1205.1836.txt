    "quantum error correction @xcite ( qec ) is an unavoidable procedure in a practical quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the standard qec @xcite includes encoding a logical qubit in several physical qubits , measuring the error syndrome using ancillary qubits , and then applying a correction operation , which depends on the measurement result .",
    "( a promising variation of this idea are the so - called surface codes @xcite . ) unfortunately , qec is very difficult experimentally @xcite , and some simplifications are often used .",
    "let us mention three of them , all of which have been introduced in ref .",
    "first , instead of using additional qubits for the error syndrome , in a `` compact '' scheme the same physical qubits can be used for the encoding and error syndrome measurement ; this is done by decoding the encoded state after a possible error occurs .",
    "second , since a single - shot measurement of a qubit state is often difficult , the standard qec can be replaced by measurement - free qec , in which the measurement and correction are substituted by a quantum controlled operation ( e.g.  the toffoli gate ) .",
    "third , a favorable type of error ( against which the code protects ) is often simulated by applying a certain unitary rotation , with the rotation angle corresponding to the error strength .",
    "measurement - free qec experiments in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) systems @xcite have been performed for over a decade , but only with ensembles of quantum systems @xcite . using trapped ions , a three - qubit qec experiment with actual measurement",
    "was realized @xcite , and recently a measurement - free qec procedure with several error correction cycles was demonstrated @xcite . in linear optics systems ,",
    "the qec experiments include two - qubit protection against `` accidental '' measurement @xcite , continuous - variable adaptation of the 9-qubit shor s code @xcite , continuous - variable erasure - correcting code @xcite , and eight - photon topological error correction @xcite .",
    "a three - qubit measurement - free qec protocol has been recently demonstrated with superconducting `` transmon '' qubits @xcite .    with the rapid progress in experiments with superconducting qubits @xcite , qec with actual measurements is becoming feasible in these systems in the reasonably near future .",
    "the subject of this paper is the analysis of several simple quantum error correction / detection protocols relevant to future experiments with superconducting qubits , mainly superconducting phase qubits @xcite .",
    "( some results of this paper have been reported earlier @xcite . )    in the past , pure dephasing was by far the dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits , and qec protecting against pure dephasing would be most important .",
    "an example of such a procedure was considered theoretically in ref .",
    "the idea was to use the standard 3-qubit repetitive code , which protects from bit flips ( i.e.  @xmath1-rotations ) . by using additional hadamard gates for each physical qubit",
    ", the @xmath1-rotations are converted into @xmath2-rotations , and therefore the same code can be used to protect against pure dephasing .    in recent years",
    ", pure dephasing in superconducting qubits was significantly reduced by various technological advances @xcite , and now energy relaxation is becoming most important .",
    "in particular , when quantum information is stored in a superconducting resonator @xcite , pure dephasing is negligible in comparison with energy relaxation .",
    "this is why in the first part of this paper ( sec .",
    "ii ) we focus on the operation of repetitive @xmath0-qubit quantum codes in the presence of energy relaxation .",
    "repetitive codes are chosen because of their relative simplicity in the encoding and decoding ( unfortunately , the standard 5-qubit or 7-qubit stabilizer codes @xcite are not feasible for superconducting qubits in the near future ) . to reduce the number of qubits in a procedure we use the standard compact scheme @xcite , in which the ancilla qubits used for encoding are also used for the error syndrome measurement .",
    "we assume that the energy relaxation happens at zero temperature , which is essentially the case for superconducting phase qubits , since the typical qubit frequency is @xmath36 ghz , and therefore the energy @xmath4 k is much larger than the experimental temperature of @xmath350 mk .",
    "even though energy relaxation may look similar to a bit - flip , it actually can be thought of as a combination of two quantum errors : bit - flip and bit - phase - flip ( which correspond to @xmath1-rotation and @xmath5-rotation ) .",
    "this is the reason why , as we show later explicitly , repetitive codes do not work for qec against energy relaxation .",
    "however , these codes can be efficiently used for quantum error detection ( qed ) . in qed",
    "we detect that an error happened but can not restore the undamaged quantum state ( in particular , the qed idea was implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite for phase errors in liquid - state nmr and has been recently investigated in ref.@xcite for detecting photon erasures ) . even though qed is of much more limited use than qec",
    ", it is still an interesting procedure , and experimentally can be considered as a first step towards full qec .",
    "we show that for qed against energy relaxation it is sufficient to use 2-qubit encoding and that there is not much benefit to use more qubits , unless a somewhat more sophisticated procedure is used .    our analysis in sec .",
    "ii is based on unraveling the qubit energy relaxation into the `` relaxation '' and `` no relaxation '' scenarios .",
    "this unraveling is quite different ( and more difficult ) than , for example , unraveling of pure dephasing into the `` phase flip '' and `` no phase flip '' scenarios .",
    "the main reason for the difference is that the unraveled states for the energy relaxation are related to the initial state in a non - unitary way .    in sec .",
    "iii we focus on simple two - qubit qec / qed protocols , somewhat similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be readily implemented using the present - day technology of phase qubits @xcite .",
    "realistic experimental parameters are used in the numerical simulation of these protocols . in the first protocol and its variations ,",
    "we assume that as in most of the previous experiments @xcite the errors are intentionally induced by particular operations pretended to be unknown .",
    "the algorithms can mainly be used for qed ; however , when the type of particular error is known ( which is the case for intentional errors in an experiment ) , the algorithms can also be used for qec .",
    "we also analyze numerically the operation of a protocol , in which the errors during a storage period are due to actual energy relaxation of two qubits ( assuming storage in resonators of a rezqu - architecture device @xcite with phase qubits ) .",
    "this protocol can only be used in the qed mode .",
    "the main result of the simulations is that the analyzed protocols can be realized at the present - day level of phase qubit technology .",
    "section iv is a conclusion .",
    "some mathematical details of the analysis are discussed in the appendix .",
    "in this section we analyze the operation of repetitive @xmath0-qubit encoding in the presence of ( markovian ) zero - temperature energy relaxation .",
    "the procedure is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the goal is to preserve an arbitrary initial state |_in= |0+|1 of the main ( upper ) qubit , where @xmath6 is the ground state and @xmath7 is the excited state . in this paper",
    "we consider only preservation of the initial state ( `` memory '' operation ) , so in discussing the fidelity of a procedure we always imply comparison with the ideal memory operation .    the encoding in fig .  1 is performed with @xmath8 controlled - not ( cnot ) gates , acting on @xmath8 ancilla qubits , which all start in the state @xmath6 .",
    "this produces the @xmath0-qubit wavefunction @xmath9 represents the product - state of @xmath0 qubits , all being in the state @xmath10 .",
    "after the encoding , all qubits are subjected to decoherence due to zero - temperature energy relaxation with relaxation time @xmath11 for the @xmath12th qubit , @xmath13 .",
    "we will mostly consider the case when the decoherence is the same for all qubits , @xmath14 .",
    "after the decoherence during time @xmath15 , the logic state is decoded by using @xmath8 cnot gates in the same way as was done for the encoding , and all @xmath8 ancilla qubits are measured in the computational basis . in the absence of decoherence ( @xmath16 ) the state after decoding is latexmath:[$(\\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle ) \\ ,    restored and",

    "a measurement result different from @xmath20 indicates an error .",
    "there are three ways to handle this situation .",
    "first , the measurement result can be simply ignored ; in this case there is obviously no benefit from using the encoding / decoding procedure .",
    "second , we can reject such cases and keep only realizations with the measurement result @xmath22 ; we will refer to this selective procedure as quantum error detection .",
    "third , we can apply a quantum operation to the main qubit to make its state closer to @xmath21 .",
    "this operation will depend on the measurement result , and the procedure is then quantum error correction .",
    "for simplicity in this section we neglect decoherence ( and other imperfections ) during encoding , decoding , and measurement ; it will be taken into account in the next section when we will discuss realistic experiments with phase qubits . to characterize the efficiency of a procedure either the quantum process tomography ( qpt ) fidelity @xmath23 or the average state fidelity @xmath24 can be used .",
    "the qpt fidelity is usually defined as @xcite @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the process matrix and @xmath27 in our case corresponds to the ideal quantum memory operation , i.e.  no evolution of the logic qubit .",
    "the average state fidelity is @xcite @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the desired unitary operator , @xmath30 is the actual mapping from the initial state to the final density matrix @xmath31 , and the normalized integral is over all pure initial states @xmath32 using the haar measure . for a trace - preserving operation @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the dimension of our hilbert space @xcite .",
    "this relation holds for qec and/or when the measurement result is ignored .",
    "however , for the qed procedure there is a problem @xcite in defining the qpt fidelity @xmath23 because the procedure is selective ; then the quantum operation for normalized states is not linear and the corresponding ( trace - preserving ) matrix @xmath26 can not be defined rigorously . in this case",
    "we _ define _ @xmath23 via the average state fidelity , f _",

    "let us calculate the quantum memory fidelity of a single qubit , without any encoding .",
    "we also consider first this simple case to demonstrate a technique of unraveling the evolution due to energy relaxation , which is later used for @xmath0-qubit encoding .    after time @xmath15",
    "an initial state @xmath35 becomes a density matrix ( here the upper row and left column correspond to the excited state @xmath7 ) _ fin = (    cc ||^2 e^-t / t_1 & ^ * e^-t/2t_1 + ^ * e^-t/2t_1 & ||^2 + ||^2 ( 1-e^t / t_1 )    ) , which can be represented using the kraus operators : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the kraus operators satisfy the completeness relation @xmath39 .",
    "this representation has an obvious interpretation as two scenarios of the evolution .",
    "the first term in eq.([unravel-1 ] ) corresponds to qubit relaxation into the ground state @xmath6 with probability @xmath40 .",
    "the second term is the no - relaxation scenario , which occurs with the remaining probability @xmath41 and transforms the qubit into the state |_n= = .",

    "it is sufficient @xcite ( see also appendix ) to calculate the average only over 6 initial states : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",

    "[ this would correspond to an equal number of experimental runs for each point of a uniform mesh on the bloch sphere , as opposed to an equal number of `` successful '' ( i.e.  selected ) runs for the previous definition . ]",

    "this simple unraveling is possible because the energy relaxation occurs only in component @xmath78 of the superposition , and in this component the qubits are unentangled .",

    "our results show that the repetitive codes do not work for qec protection against energy relaxation .",
    "this is because energy relaxation is very different from a bit flip ( or phase flip or bit - phase flip ) , for which repetitive codes work well . in the language of quantum stabilizer codes",
    "@xcite the event of energy relaxation corresponds to the `` sum '' of two errors : bit flip ( @xmath1-operation ) and bit - phase flip ( @xmath5-operation )  see the kraus operator @xmath155 in eq .",

    "the hilbert space of the dimension @xmath158 can be divided into @xmath116 orthogonal two - dimensional subspaces ( `` copies '' of the qubit space ) ; these subspaces should be able to distinguish the cases with various errors and no error .",

    "this code breaks the above limitation because the relaxation event is treated as one error , not as a `` sum '' of @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( the drawback though is a slightly probabilistic operation ) . in any case , the qec codes protecting against energy relaxation are much more complicated than the repetitive codes .    even though the repetitive codes are not good for qec protection against energy relaxation , we have shown that they can be well used for qed .",
    "moreover , only 2-qubit encoding is sufficient for that .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not it is beneficial to do many cycles of qed , correspondingly decreasing the time of each cycle and therefore the error probability @xmath61 in each cycle ( such division into shorter cycles is beneficial for qec @xcite ) .",
    "the simple answer is that such division into shorter cycles does not help much for the protocol of fig .  1 .",
    "the reason is that even when no relaxation events happen , the qubit state changes ",
    "see eq.([nq - none ] ) , because the absence of relaxation preferentially indicates state @xmath6 and plays the same role as the partial collapse @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , some improvement of the qed fidelity will be due to a decrease of the probability @xmath128 that all qubits relax . since this probability scales as @xmath164 , the division into @xmath165 cycles is expected to decrease the corresponding contribution to the procedure infidelity by the factor @xmath166 .",

    "a more important improvement of the qed fidelity can be achieved if the no - relaxation evolution ( [ nq - none ] ) of @xmath169 is compensated .",
    "one way is to apply a partial measurement @xcite to the main qubit after the procedure , essentially eliminating the evolution ( [ nq - none ] ) for the price of a further decrease of the selection probability ( probability of success ) .",
