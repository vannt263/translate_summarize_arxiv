    "the theory of newton - okounkov bodies is introduced by okounkov in order to study multiplicity functions for representations of a reductive group ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and afterward developed independently by kaveh - khovanskii ( @xcite ) and by lazarsfeld - mustata ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a normal projective variety of complex dimension @xmath1 , and @xmath2 a very ample line bundle on @xmath0 .",
    "take a valuation @xmath3 on the function field @xmath4 with values in @xmath5 , and fix a nonzero section @xmath6 ; in addition , we assume that @xmath3 has one - dimensional leaves ( see   2.1 for the definition ) . from these data ,",
    "we construct a semigroup @xmath7 ( see definition [ newton - okounkov body ] ) .",
    "if we denote by @xmath8 the smallest real closed cone containing @xmath9 , then the newton - okounkov body @xmath10 is defined to be the intersection of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the theory of newton - okounkov bodies is a generalization of that of newton polytopes for toric varieties , and these convex bodies have important geometric information about @xmath0 ; for instance , we can systematically construct a series of toric degenerations of @xmath0 by the following result .",
    "assume that the semigroup @xmath9 is finitely generated , and hence the newton - okounkov body @xmath13 is a rational convex polytope .",
    "then , there exists a flat degeneration of @xmath0 to a @xmath14not necessarily normal@xmath15 toric variety @xmath16);$ ] note that the normalization of @xmath17 is the normal toric variety corresponding to the polytope @xmath13 .",
    "however , the semigroup @xmath9 is not finitely generated in general , and the newton - okounkov body @xmath13 may not be a rational convex polytope . hence the following is a fundamental question : `` when is the semigroup @xmath9 finitely generated ? ''",
    "although it is difficult to give a complete answer to this question , there exist some partial results in this direction ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we provide a series of examples , in which the semigroup @xmath9 is indeed finitely generated , and hence the newton - okounkov body @xmath13 is indeed a rational convex polytope .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the theory of newton - okounkov bodies is deeply connected with representation theory ; for instance , kaveh ( @xcite ) proved that the newton - okounkov body of a schubert variety with respect to a specific valuation is identical to the string polytope constructed from the string parameterization for a demazure crystal .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend this result to bott - samelson varieties .    to be more precise , let @xmath18 be a connected , simply - connected semisimple algebraic group over @xmath19 , @xmath20 its lie algebra , @xmath21 a borel subgroup , and @xmath22 an index set for the vertices of the dynkin diagram .",
    "for simplicity , we deal with only finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath20 ; but , our result can be extended to a symmetrizable kac - moody lie algebra without much difficulty .",
    "an arbitrary word @xmath23 gives a smooth projective variety @xmath24 , called a bott - samelson variety , and we can associate to @xmath25 a line bundle @xmath26 on @xmath24 ; note that we need not assume that @xmath26 is very ample .",
    "we consider a specific local coordinate @xmath27 in @xmath24 ( see   2.3 ) , and identify the function field @xmath28 with the rational function field @xmath29 . define a valuation @xmath30 on @xmath28 to be the highest term valuation on @xmath29 with respect to the lexicographic order on @xmath5 ( see example [ highest term valuation ] ) .",
    "we then take a specific section of @xmath26 .",

    "a dominant integral weight @xmath33 , let us denote by @xmath34 the irreducible highest weight @xmath18-module with highest weight @xmath33 .",
    "then , the dual @xmath32-module @xmath35 is realized as a @xmath32-submodule of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , denote the fundamental weights ; this @xmath32-submodule @xmath39 is called a generalized demazure module .",
    "we regard @xmath40 as a quotient @xmath32-module of @xmath41 , and denote by @xmath42 the image of the lowest weight vector in @xmath41 . in this setting , we study the newton - okounkov body @xmath43 .",

    " 5.2 is devoted to the study of these properties ; for instance , we give a system of piecewise - linear inequalities defining @xmath50 , and show that @xmath50 is a finite union of rational convex polytopes .    in section 6",
