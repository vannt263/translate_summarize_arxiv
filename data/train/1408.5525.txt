    "<S> the profound low current minima in @xmath12 at rational @xmath19 support this conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> our key observation is a reversal of the minima in @xmath12 at rational @xmath19 into maxima upon increasing the current bias , which , as we show below by scaling analysis , is a direct manifestation of the existence of the vortex mott insulator and its transition into a metallic state . </S>",

    "<S> the vortex mott insulating behavior manifests itself as the tendency to downward divergence of the @xmath12 traces on approach to @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , upon the vortex mott insulator - to - metal transition with the increasing current , an upward divergence of @xmath12 traces marks the profound metallic - like @xmath12 behavior near @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the dip - to - peak evolution upon increasing current is observed only in @xmath12 , but not in the @xmath24 quantity responsible for the dissipation ( see fig.s1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we identify the currents @xmath26 corresponding to separatrices between insulating and metallic behavior as critical currents at which the dynamic mott transition occurs , and find them from the condition @xmath27 ( asymmetry between @xmath26 may reflect the asymmetry between the ` particle ' and ` hole ' tunneling dynamics near commensurate values of frustration parameter , and parallels the asymmetry between transition temperatures of electrons- and holes - doped mott insulators  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these separatrices are highlighted by dots in fig.3a - c . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath28 the respective @xmath12 traces display minima , marked by strokes in fig.3a - c encompassing the region of metallic behavior . </S>",

    "<S> accordingly , the static mott transition exhibits scaling behavior with respect to temperature , @xmath36 and the repulsion strength @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field version of the hubbard model predicts  @xcite that near the mott critical point @xmath37 , where @xmath11 and @xmath38 are critical temperature and critical particle repulsion strength , respectively , the deviation @xmath39 should scale as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the exponent relating the scaling of the source field with the order parameter . to find the critical behavior of the dynamic _ vortex _ mott transition , </S>",
    "<S> we note that the role of @xmath34 is taken by the magnetic field @xmath9 which sets the vortex density and , as such , controls the vortex repulsion . drawing inspiration from the theory of nonequilibrium critical fluctuations near a dynamic phase transition@xcite which found that the equilibrium singular behavior with respect to @xmath42 turns into a singular behavior with respect to deviation from the critical value of applied bias , we conjecture the following mapping of the critical behavior of the static mott transition to that of dynamic vortex mott transition : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the critical point @xmath45 yielding critical scaling @xmath46 . to show the validity of this assumption we scale our @xmath12 data into the universal form @xmath47_{i = i_0}={\\cal f_{\\pm}}\\left(\\frac{|i - i_0^{\\pm}|}{|h|^{(\\delta-1)/\\delta}}\\right)\\ , ,      \\label{scaling}\\ ] ] taking the exponent @xmath41 as an adjustable fitting parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the best collapse of the data onto a single curve near @xmath48 is achieved at @xmath49 ( fig.3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the independent scaling procedures at both , the left- and right - hand sides of the critical frustration yield the same value of @xmath41 , despite that separatrices are different . the same procedure for the left- and right - hand sides of @xmath50 and 2 gives rise to @xmath51 ( fig.3e , f ) . </S>",

    "<S> we find @xmath55 for all four plots . </S>",
    "<S> the revealed universal scaling properties of the current and magnetic field dependent differential resistance , following eq.1 , experimentally establishes the dynamic vortex mott transition and the existence of the vortex mott insulator in superconducting networks .    </S>",

    "<S> the mapping is achieved by substitutions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the size of the system along the magnetic field ( i.e. the vortex ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> this makes our system an irreplaceable high - precision laboratory for studying dynamic mott behaviors in quantum systems at easily accessible moderate temperatures .    turning to the difference between critical exponents at integer and fractional frustration parameters ( @xmath51 for @xmath82 and @xmath49 for @xmath48 ) note that an integer vortex mott insulator corresponds to full filling of the sites . </S>",
