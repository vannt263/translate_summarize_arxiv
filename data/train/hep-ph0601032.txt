    "the heavy hadron @xmath16 may have been observed by selex collaboration already@xcite , although some comments@xcite pointed out that the measured lifetime is much shorter and the production rate is much larger than most of the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that at the fixed target experiment , only about @xmath17 of @xmath18 events in its total sample are producted by @xmath16 , however the selex collaboration has found that almost @xmath19 of @xmath18 events in its total sample are producted by @xmath16 .    in the literature ,",
    "most of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations and predictions for @xmath0 denotes @xmath16 or @xmath1 , i.e. , the isospin - breaking effects are ignorable here . ]",
    "hadroproduction are based on the ` gluon - gluon fusion mechanism ' i.e. that via the subprocess , @xmath3_{\\bar 3}+\\bar{c}+\\bar{c}$ ] only .",
    "whereas , the subprocess @xmath4_6+\\bar{c}+\\bar{c}$ ] may also contribute to the production@xcite .",
    "it is because that @xmath16 and @xmath1 contain the higher components @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 ) etc in their fock space expansion , so the corresponding subprocess should be taken into account .",
    "the discussion shown in ref.@xcite indicates that an inclusive production rate of @xmath2 or @xmath1 can be factorized into two parts , one part is to produce two free @xmath22 quarks , which can be calculated by pqcd , another part is to make these two free @xmath22 quarks into a @xmath23 diquark pair : @xmath24 $ ] or @xmath25 $ ] , then the diquark pair hadronizing either into @xmath2 by absorbing a quark @xmath26 or into @xmath1 by absorbing a quark @xmath27 for @xmath24 $ ] , or either into @xmath2 by absorbing a quark @xmath26 or into @xmath1 by absorbing a quark @xmath27 but both absorbing an extra soft gluon for @xmath28 $ ] , all of which can be attributed to non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) matrix elements @xcite . in most of the existent calculations for the hadronic production of @xmath0 , the @xmath23 diquark pair is assumed to be in @xmath29 configuration and in the color representation @xmath30 ( @xmath24 $ ] ) .",
    "whereas according to power counting in velocity @xmath31 , the velocity of the heavy @xmath22 quarks in the baryon , the nrqcd matrix elements @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( defined in eq.([matrixelement ] ) ) for the nonperturbative transition , which correspond to the two configurations of the diquark pair ( @xmath32 is that for @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath33 is that for @xmath28 $ ] ) , are at the same order of @xmath31 @xcite . hence to give a full estimation of the hadronic production of @xmath0 , we think that @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] should be treated on the equal footing .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in refs.@xcite , the so - called ` intrinsic ' charm mechanism can give sizable contribution to the charmonium hadroproduction@xcite , and to the @xmath34 hadroproduction , especially in small @xmath15 region@xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to considering two configurations of diquark pair in different color representation @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , it is also interesting to see how important of the ` intrinsic ' charm mechanisms via the sub - processes @xmath5_{\\bf \\bar 3}+\\bar{c}$ ] , @xmath37_{\\bf 6}+\\bar{c}$ ] and @xmath38_{\\bf \\bar 3}+g$ ] , @xmath8_{\\bf 6}+g$ ] , in hadronic production of @xmath16 and @xmath1 precisely .",
    "principally , the ` intrinsic ' charm mechanism induced by the heavy charm quark is greatly suppressed by the parton distributions in comparison with the valance and the sea of light quarks and gluon , but it is ` compensated ' by ` greater phase space ' and lower order of interaction coupling of qcd . namely the ` intrinsic ' processes are @xmath39 sub - processes at the order of @xmath40 , while for the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess , its leading contribution starts at @xmath41 and is a @xmath42 process .    for a fixed target experiment which can reach to the region of very small transverse momentum @xmath15 , the production of the doubly charmed baryon @xmath0 should additionally involve more ` mechanisms ' , such as the mechanisms of the so - called intrinsic charm fusion with the subprocesses @xmath38_{\\bf \\bar 3}$ ] and @xmath8_{\\bf 6}$ ] , which contribute to the production only with very small @xmath15 but",
    "whose nature essentially is non - perturbative for qcd .",
    "the theoretical predictions on the hadronic production rate all can be based upon the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) only , though the existent ones are orders of magnitude smaller than the selex observation as pointed out by ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we think that it is worthwhile to consider more mechanisms than that in the existent predictions , and to use the updated parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme to re - estimate the @xmath0 hadroproduction so as to cover a so widen @xmath15 region as pqcd is applicable .",
    "especially , more attention to the so - called intrinsic charm production mechanism , that is through the subprocesses @xmath43_{\\bf \\bar 3}+\\bar{c}$ ] , @xmath37_{\\bf 6}+\\bar{c}$ ] and @xmath38_{\\bf \\bar 3}+g$ ] , @xmath8_{\\bf 6}+g$ ] , should be payed._{\\bf \\bar 3}$ ] and @xmath8_{\\bf 6}$ ] are not considered ( because they are of non - perturbative qcd as mentioned above ) . since",
    "the ` higher order ' mechanisms with the subprocesses : @xmath38_{\\bf \\bar 3}+g$ ] , @xmath8_{\\bf 6}+g$ ] are also taken into account so as to ` complete the estimate ' , so in order to guarantee pqcd applicable and the obtained results being reliable , we compute the production always to put on a sizable cut on the transverse momentum @xmath15 of the produced @xmath14-pair . ]",
    "this work is devoted to give a comparative studies of various production mechanisms , and is also served as a cross - check of the pqcd calculation for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , because the results given in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite are in disagreement .",
    "our results satisfy the gauge invariance at the amplitude , and our results agree with that of ref.@xcite except for an overall factor 2 .",
    "when combining the results of ` intrinsic ' charm mechanism with the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , one needs to make some subtractions to the ` intrinsic ' mechanism so as to avoid ` double counting ' . to perform the subtraction",
    ", we adopt the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme @xcite , in which the heavy - quark mass effects can be treated in a consistent way both for the hard scattering amplitude and the pdfs .",
    "moreover , it will be necessary to use the dedicated pdfs with heavy - mass effects included , which are determined by global fitting utilizing massive hard - scattering cross - sections .",
    "for instance , for the present analysis , the up - dated one cteq6hq @xcite is used .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the production of @xmath0 at @xmath44 collider is treated carefully and hadronic production is estimated roughly by comparing with @xmath22-quark jet both by taking the fragmentation approach . in the present paper , alternatively , we take the full pqcd approach to do the estimate with more mechanisms , because we think the fragmentation approach becomes reliable only at the high @xmath15 regions where the fragmentation mechanism is dominant and also the results from the fragmentation approach show a strong dependence on the input parameter values @xcite . at",
    "last , our results show that when assuming @xmath45 , the contribution to the hadronic production of @xmath0 from the doubly charmed diquark pair in @xmath25 $ ] can be sizable as that from @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we shall first give the formulation for the hadronic production of @xmath0 within the gm - vfn scheme , and then present in some more detail the formulae for both the gluon - gluon mechanism and the ` intrinsic ' charm mechanism . in sec.iii , we present the results for the subprocess and make a comparison with those in the literature . in sec.iv , we present the numerical results for the hadronic production of @xmath0 and make some discussion over them . the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    "under the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme @xcite , according to pqcd factorization theorem the cross - section for the hadronic production of @xmath0 can be formulated as below :",

    ", we have taken the renormalization scale @xmath57 for the subprocess and the factorization scale @xmath58 for factorizing the pdfs and the hard subprocess to be the same , i.e. @xmath59 . in the square bracket ,",
    "the subtraction for @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 the quark distribution @xmath62 inside an on - shell gluon up to order @xmath48 can be connected to the familiar @xmath63 splitting function @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 , with @xmath66 . later on for convenience , we shall call the ` heavy quark mechanisms ' , in which proper subtraction has been given according to method in gm - vfn scheme , as ` intrinsic ones ' accordingly .    in eq.([pqcdf0 ] ) , the first term is the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , the second and the third terms are the so called ` intrinsic ' charm mechanisms @xcite , in which all the subtraction terms are necessary to avoid the double counting problem , since these terms represent the parts of the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism which are already included in a fully qcd evolved ` intrinsic ' charm distribution function @xcite . the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism has been considered by several authors @xcite . however , in these references , they usually used a pdf in a zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme but performed the partonic cross section calculation using the non - zero heavy - quark masses .",
    "such treatment shall not heavily affect the results for the hadronic production at lhc or tevatron as is the case of @xmath34 production @xcite , however it will make large discrepancies at the fixed target experiment , i.e. selex experiment .",
    "this is because , for the fixed target experiment , most of the generated @xmath0 events are concentrated in the small @xmath15 regions , where large uncertainties are caused due to the inconsistent using of pdf .",
    "this is one of the reason that we adopt the gm - vfn scheme to study the hadronic production of @xmath0 in which the heavy - quark mass effects can be treated in a consistent way both for the hard scattering amplitude and the pdfs .    for the ` intrinsic ' charm mechanisms at the leading order",
    ", we need to calculate subprocesses : @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for the hadronic production via @xmath68 , because its hard subprocess is a @xmath69 subprocess and the @xmath15 cut is unavoidable to ensure the applicable of the pqcd calculation , it at least need to emit one hard gluon to obtain the @xmath15 distribution .",
    "therefore we shall calculate @xmath70 other than @xmath71 in the following calculations .",
    "note for @xmath72 mechanism , it has no double counting problem with the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism and does not need to introduce the subtraction term , since it is one order higher than the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism according to the power counting rule shown in ref.@xcite .    according to nrqcd formulation",

    "the results there show that such effect is really small . ] and then the momentum of the final baryon may be considered roughly equal to the momentum of initial diquark .",
