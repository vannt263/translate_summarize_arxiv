    "we consider the global existence of dynamics of classical electromagnetism for extended rigid charges .",
    "to put our work into proper perspective we shall introduce a number of theories ml , ml - si , mld , wf , and @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the former are theories for point - charges , the latter are the theories modified by smeared out charges , i.e. extended rigid charges indicated by the charge distribution @xmath3 .",
    "it will become clear in a moment , why it is helpful to introduce these notations .",
    "ml stands for maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics - the textbook electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "it is the theory of interaction between electromagnetic radiation and charged matter .",
    "the electrodynamic field is represented by an antisymmetric second - rank tensor field @xmath4 on four - dimensional minkowski space @xmath5 equipped with a metric tensor @xmath6 .",
    "charged matter is described by the four - vector charge - current density @xmath7 on @xmath8 . for a prescribed current @xmath7",
    "the time evolution of the electrodynamic field @xmath4 is ruled by the maxwell equations @xmath9 where we have used einstein s summation convention for greek indices , i.e. @xmath10 , and denote the partial derivative with respect to the standard unit vectors in @xmath11 by @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    in turn , for a given electromagnetic field @xmath4 , the motion of @xmath14 point - like particles , which are represented by world lines @xmath15 , @xmath16 with labels @xmath17 , obey the lorentz force law @xmath18 here @xmath19 denotes the mass and @xmath20 is a coupling constant ( the charge ) of the @xmath21-th particle .",
    "the overset dots denote differentiation with respect to the world line parametrization @xmath22 .",
    "ml is defined by the system of equations ( [ eqn : original maxwell ] ) and ( [ eqn : lorentzforce ] ) coupled by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the four - dimensional dirac delta distribution .",
    "unfortunately and well known , ml is merely a formal set of equations .",
    "the system has no solutions .",
    "the reason is that the self - field , the field created by a point - charge and acting back on it , is infinite at the position of the point - charge . for reasons which become clear",
    "soon we recall the nature of this singularity . due to the linearity of the maxwell equations",
    "we may decompose the field @xmath4 into the sum of fields @xmath25 , @xmath26 , fulfilling @xmath27 and write ( [ eqn : lorentzforce ] ) as @xmath28 again by linearity the solutions @xmath25 can be decomposed into a special solution and an arbitrary homogeneous solution @xmath29 , i.e. a solution of the homogeneous maxwell equations ( [ eqn : cea m eq for ji ] ) for @xmath30 : @xmath31_{+}+f[z_k]_{-}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the special solutions @xmath32 , f_{-}[z_k]$ ] are the well known advanced and retarded linard - wiechert fields of the @xmath33-th world line @xcite given by @xmath34^\\mu_{\\pm}(x):=e\\frac{\\dot z_i^\\mu(\\tau^\\pm)}{(x - z_i(\\tau^\\pm))_\\nu\\dot z_i^\\nu(\\tau^\\pm ) } , & & z^0_i(\\tau^\\pm)=x^0\\pm\\|{{\\mathbf{x}}}-{{\\mathbf{z}}}_i(\\tau^\\pm)\\| , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the notation @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the square brackets emphasize that these fields are functionals of the world line @xmath37 ; note that @xmath38 in ( [ eqn : lw fields ] ) are implicitly defined . now",
    "( [ eqn : lw fields ] ) shows that the @xmath39_+(x ) , f[z_k]_-(x)$ ] become infinite at @xmath40 .",
    "but it is exactly there where the @xmath41 summand in the lorentz force ( [ eqn : cea ml+si lornetz force ] ) needs to be evaluated .",
    "this divergence persists also in quantum field theories where it is referred to as _",
    "uv divergence_.    the simplest modification which avoids singular fields is @xmath0 , suggested by abraham and lorentz .",
    "it is ml but with the point - charges replaced by extended charges ; cf . ( [ eqn : maxwell equations]),([eqn : lorentz force ] ) . however",
    ", a rigid extension of the charge is for physical reasons unwanted @xcite , and furthermore ( even if correctly lorentz - boosted ) in violation with relativity @xcite .",
    "the most familiar attempt to achieve a relativistic point - charge electromagnetism without singularities is the mass renormalization program of dirac @xcite .",
    "in essence it is a point - charge limit procedure of @xmath0 .",
    "dirac replaces the lorentz equations ( in a more or less ad hoc manner ) by @xmath42_{-}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(f[z_i]_{-}-f[z_i]_{+}\\right)\\right]^{\\mu\\nu}(z_i(\\tau))\\;\\dot z_{i,\\nu}(\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations ( @xmath43 ) are called the lorentz - dirac equations ( ld ) .",
    "note that the mass appearing on the left - hand side is the so called experimental mass @xmath44 ( see below ) . according to ld",
    "the @xmath21-th particle feels a lorentz force due to an autonomous free field @xmath29 and due to the retarded fields @xmath39_{-}$ ] of all other charges .",
    "furthermore , it feels the force term @xmath45_{-}-f[z_i]_{+}\\right)$ ] which was interpreted by dirac as the radiation field produced by the charge itself and is to be held responsible for radiation damping .",
    "he computed its principal value : @xmath46^{\\mu\\nu}_{-}-f[z_i]^{\\mu\\nu}_{+}\\right)(z_i(\\tau))=\\frac{2}{3}e_i^2\\left(\\dddot z_i^\\mu(\\tau)\\dot z_i^\\nu(\\tau)- \\dddot z_i^\\nu(\\tau)\\dot z_i^\\mu(\\tau)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the third derivative is supposed to describe friction , hence the name _ radiation damping _ equation .",
    "dirac s limit procedure can be reinterpreted as a renormalization procedure in which the so called bare masses @xmath47 approach @xmath48 , thereby subtracting the singular behavior of the fields @xmath49 when the charge extension goes to zero as well as yielding the observed experimental mass @xmath50 . in this respect",
    "it may be worth noting that in @xcite it was observed that a negative bare mass @xmath47 causes the dynamics of @xmath0 to become unstable .",
    "in any case it is well known that ld has unphysical solutions . already for @xmath51 and zero homogeneous fields all solutions except @xmath52 show run - away behavior , i.e. they approach the speed of light exponentially fast .",
    "for a detailed analysis of the ld equation see @xcite .",
    "mld is the theory defined by the maxwell equations ( [ eqn : cea m eq for ji ] ) coupled to ( [ eqn : cea effective lorentz ] ) via ( [ current ] ) .",
    "the main aim of our research , of which we present results in this and the follow up paper @xcite , is in fact the description of electromagnetic phenomena without self - field divergences .",
    "that is why we focus on another formulation of electrodynamics without self - fields which is suggested by the wheeler - feynman electromagnetism @xcite and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that fields are only mediators of interaction _ between _ charges .",
    "we consider the maxwell equations ( [ eqn : cea m eq for ji ] ) but we replace the lorentz force law by @xmath53 note that in contrast to ( [ eqn : cea ml+si lornetz force ] ) the self - field summand @xmath54 is excluded . we refer to this theory as ml - si ( maxwell - lorentz without self interaction ) . to connect this theory with mld we appeal to the observation done by wheeler and feynman , namely that to any solution of ml - si satisfying the extra constraint @xmath55_{-}-f[z_i]_{+}\\right)(x)= 0 , \\quad \\forall x\\in{{\\mathbb{m } } } ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] belong world lines of the charges which satisfy the ld equation .",
    "one sees this by trivial manipulations of terms .",
    "based on dirac s interpretation of the term @xmath56_{-}-f[z_i]_{+})$ ] as the field radiated by the @xmath21-th charge , ( [ eqn : absorber assumption ] ) states that the net radiation field is completely absorbed from which the name _ complete absorption condition _ ( ac ) is derived .",
    "wheeler and feynman think of this condition as being satisfied for a thermal equilibrium distribution of a large number of charges and discuss it thoroughly in @xcite . stretching notations somewhat",
    "we may rephrase the above in a formal way by @xmath57 where we understand the symbols now as sets of solutions : @xmath58 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) is the set of solutions of ml - si ( resp .",
    "mld ) which fulfill ac .    an important feature of ml - si is that it is very close to wf , the wheeler - feynman electromagnetism : wf contains no fields at all , only charges and is defined by @xmath60_++f[z_k]_-\\right)^{\\mu\\nu}(z_i(\\tau))\\;\\dot z_{i,\\nu}(\\tau)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39_+$ ] and @xmath39_-$ ] are given by ( [ eqn : lw fields ] ) . due to the implicit definition of @xmath61 in ( [ eqn : lw fields ] ) these equations",
    "involve advanced and retarded arguments and they belong mathematically to the class of neutral differential equations with unbounded delay .",
    "the connection between wf and ml - si becomes manifest when we consider the case for which the homogeneous fields vanish : @xmath62 .",
    "let us refer to this restricted theory as ml - si@xmath63 .",
    "in view of ( [ eqn : forcedeco ] ) and ( [ eqn : cea ml - si lornetz force ] ) the world lines appearing in the solutions of ml - si@xmath63 are wf world lines , i.e. they fulfill ( [ eqn : wf eqn ] ) . in short : @xmath64it is important that the reader appreciates the difference between ml - si and wf .",
    "there is no solution theory of wf , since the equations contain time - like advanced and retarded arguments .",
    "the problem of existence of dynamics of wf is in fact famously difficult , since it is unclear how to even start a theory of solutions . on the other hand ,",
    "ml - si is mathematically an initial value problem and at least the notion of local existence and uniqueness of solutions is clear .",
    "now it seems that with ( [ eqn : crucial ] ) all is clear , because wf is simply ml - si with the homogeneous fields being zero .",
    "but there is a catch",
    ": one has no idea for which _ initial _ fields it is the case that the homogeneous field fulfills @xmath65 or equivalently @xmath66_++f[z_k]_-\\right)$ ] . in other words",
    "we do not know the initial conditions which define ml - si/(@xmath67 ) .",
    "nevertheless ( [ eqn : crucial ] ) allows us to get a handle on the question of existence of solutions of wf which we present in the follow up paper @xcite . however , to be able to apply ( [ eqn : crucial ] ) to the wf problem we must be sure that the linard - wiechert fields ( [ eqn : lw fields ] ) generated by wf world lines are within the class of fields of ml - si/(@xmath67 )",
    ". now some solutions of wf are known , namely the so called schild solutions @xcite which describe charges rotating around each other on stable orbits . such world lines with non - vanishing acceleration for large times generate linard - wiechert fields ( [ eqn : lw fields ] ) that are in general not square integrable .",
    "we must therefore prove a general existence of dynamics result for ml - si where we allow fields which are not square integrable .",
    "now that we have explained the role of the theory ml - si , which under the condition ac ( cf .",
    "( [ eqn : absorber assumption ] ) ) describes the observed radiation phenomena , we must step back .",
    "ml - si avoids the singular self - fields which make the dynamics ill - defined from the start .",
    "but that does not mean that ml - si allows the existence of _ global _ solutions for _ all _ initial conditions .",
    "in fact , to establish existence of global solutions some notion of _ typical _ initial conditions must be invoked , since ml - si ( for opposite charges ) is very analogous to masses interacting via gravitation , hence scenarios like explosions may be possible ; see for example @xcite . however , such considerations are at this early stage of research not in our focus and , for simplicity , we consider @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "i.e. the theories with extended charges where singularities do not even occur when charges pass through each other .",
    "we establish here the global existence and uniqueness of @xmath1 and by the same token that of @xmath0 .",
    "the charge density @xmath3 we consider is rigid .",
    "global existence and uniqueness of solutions of @xmath0 for one particle and square integrable initial fields , has been settled by two different techniques : while in @xcite one exploits the energy conservation to gain an priori bound needed for global existence , a grnwall argument was used in @xcite .",
    "recent results are on the long - time behavior of solutions in @xcite and @xcite and on conservation laws in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a generalization to a spinning , extended charge was treated in @xcite .",
    "for the mathematical analysis it is convenient to express @xmath1 and @xmath0 in non - relativistic notation using coordinates . the electric and magnetic field of each charge are defined by @xmath68 , @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the defining equations are @xmath70 together with @xmath71    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath17",
    ". the equations in the right - hand column of ( [ eqn : maxwell equations ] ) are also called the _",
    "maxwell constraints_. we denote the partial derivative with respect to time @xmath72 by @xmath73 , the divergence by @xmath74 and the curl by @xmath75 .",
    "vectors in @xmath76 are written as bold letters , e.g. @xmath77 . at time",
    "@xmath72 the @xmath21-th charge is situated at position @xmath78 in euclidean space @xmath76 and has momentum @xmath79 .",
    "it carries the classical mass @xmath80 .",
    "the geometry of the @xmath21-th rigid charge is given in terms of a charge distribution ( or form factor ) @xmath81 which is assumed to be an infinitely often differentiable function with compact support , denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "the factors @xmath83 denote the sign of the masses ( negative masses are useful to analyze dynamical instability when taking the point - particle limit to mld ) .",
    "each charge is associated with an own electric and magnetic field @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which are @xmath76 valued functions on @xmath76 .",
    "whereas in the classical literature one usually considers only one electric and magnetic field , we have given every charge its own field to allow exclusion of self - fields : the matrix coefficients @xmath86 for @xmath87 allow to switch on or off the coupling of the @xmath7-th field to the @xmath21-th particle .",
    "this yields @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 the corresponding system of equations formally define ml and ml - si , respectively .",
    "the existence and uniqueness theory build in the following will neither depend on a particular choice of the coupling matrix @xmath91 , nor on the masses @xmath47 , nor on a particular choice of the charge distributions @xmath82 . for notational simplicity we shall now denote - in slight abuse of notation - the theory for any choices of the coupling matrix @xmath91 simply by @xmath0 .",
    "we intend to arrive at a well - posed initial value problem for given positions and momenta @xmath92 as well as electric and magnetic fields @xmath93 at time @xmath94 for which we define the function space for the fields . as we remarked in the introduction",
    "we wish to incorporate linard - wiechert fields produced by any time - like charge trajectory with uniformly bounded acceleration and momentum as cauchy data ( e.g. consider the bounded orbits of the schild solutions @xcite ) .",
    "we shall show in the follow up paper @xcite that such fields decay as @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "hence , in general these fields are not in @xmath97 and that is why we establish the initial value problem for a bigger class of fields :    [ def : weighted spaces ] we define the class of weight functions @xmath98 for any @xmath99 and open @xmath100 we define the space of weighted square integrable functions @xmath101 by @xmath102 for regularity arguments we need more conditions on the weight functions . for @xmath103",
    "we define @xmath104 and @xmath105    the choice of @xmath106 is quite natural ( compare @xcite ) as for most estimates it allows to treat the new measure @xmath107 almost as if it were translational invariant .",
    "clearly , @xmath108 is in @xmath106 . applying its definition twice we obtain for all @xmath99 the estimate @xmath109 which states that @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , the weight @xmath111 is in @xmath106 because @xmath112 and therefore the desired linard - wiechert fields are in @xmath113 for @xmath114 . in the follow up paper @xcite it is shown that @xmath115 . with this we can define the space of initial values :    [ def : phasespace ] we define @xmath116 any element @xmath117 consists of the components @xmath118 , i.e. positions @xmath119 , momenta @xmath120 and electric and magnetic fields @xmath121 and @xmath122 for each of the @xmath17 charges .",
    "if not noted otherwise , any spatial derivative will be understood in the distribution sense , and the latin indices @xmath123 run over the charge labels @xmath124 .",
    "we also need the weighted sobolev spaces @xmath125 for any @xmath103 .",
    "we will rewrite @xmath0 using the following operators @xmath126 and @xmath127 :    [ def : operator_a ] for a @xmath118 we defined @xmath128 and @xmath126 by the expression @xmath129 on their natural domain @xmath130 furthermore , for any @xmath131 we define @xmath132    [ def : operator_j ] together with @xmath133 we define @xmath134 by @xmath135 for @xmath118 .",
