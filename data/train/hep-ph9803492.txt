    "in their existing estimation@xcite , there is not so much difference of the neutron edms between in the susy su(5 ) gut model and in the standard model except the large @xmath3 settings , because the cp violating phase only in the quark sector of the mass matrix is taken into account , and such phase in the higgs sector is essentially neglected . generally speaking , according to the kobayashi - maskawa theorem @xcite ,",
    "a mass matrix consisted of @xmath4 or more components can include the complex phase to violate cp .",
    "thus , we introduce the complex phase into the higgs sector of the mass matrix , because the higgs / higgsino superfields have five components in this model , and the existence of this new phase is one of the features of the susy su(5 ) gut model in contrast to the standard model or mssm . when trying to estimate the neutron edm in the susy su(5 ) gut model , this new mechanism to violate cp should be taken into consideration . in the following sections , all the estimations are carried out with including this new mechanism to violate cp symmetry .",
    "in this section , we present a sequence of the derivation from the general theory of susy su(5 ) gut to the estimation of the neutron edm .      in the susy",

    "it is well - known that most of the symmetries in this model , like susy , are broken in our real world ; the sequence to break the symmetries down is as follows :    1 .",
    "the original su(5 ) symmetry is breaking to su(3)@xmath24su(2)@xmath24u(1 ) with the energy scale getting lower by the higgs mechanism of the heavy higgs bosons in 24-representation .",
    "moreover , the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously by added the soft breaking terms@xcite as : @xmath25 where , @xmath26 s are the scalar fields , @xmath27 stands for the trilinear scalar terms , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the two higgs multiplets , and @xmath30 s are the gauge fermions .",

    "3 .   furthermore ,",
    "su(2 ) symmetry is spontaneously breaking to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry as usual : @xmath35 the observations of the neutron edm are hold in this energy region .      in order to estimate the edm of a quark current ,",
    "the shapes of one - loop graphs shown in fig.1 are regarded .",
    "the representations of each particles coincide with their physical states , where the explicit forms of the representations are shown in appendix b. the diagrams including the virtual loop of the chargino , neutralino or the gluino can generate the cp - odd contributions to the current amplitude .",
    "therefore , the contributions of these three kinds of the diagrams are taken into account . the graphs including the virtual loop of the heavy gauginos ( _ i.e. _ , x - ino or y - ino ) and the heavy higgsinos are also possible to contribute cp - oddly , however , they are neglected . roughly speaking , since the edms are proportional to the inverse of the virtual particle masses ;",
    "the edm values of such graphs including heavy virtual particles are extremely small compared to the graphs of the charginos , neutralinos , or the gluino .",
