    "the simulation of dynamical processes within the theory of general relativity plays an important role for understanding astrophysical phenomena , for studying the stability of equilibrium configurations by introducing small perturbations and evolving in time and for predicting the properties of the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "an ideal way of analyzing such processes carefully would be the construction of explicit solutions to einstein s field equations .",
    "however , due to the mathematical complexity of these equations , even stationary configurations can be described in terms of analytic expressions in only a few exceptional cases .",
    "therefore , the only chance for tackling time dependent processes is the application of numerical methods .",
    "nevertheless , in order to come as close as possible to an explicit solution , it is desirable to find mathematical descriptions and numerical procedures that permit the computation of a very accurate approximation to the solution in question .    as we demonstrate in this paper , a promising approach towards this goal",
    "is the combination of highly accurate ( pseudo- ) spectral methods with the fruitful concept of conformally compactified space - times are replaced by other conditions at the boundaries of these domains . ] . by means of spectral methods ,",
    "general relativistic equilibrium configurations have been obtained with almost machine accuracy @xcite .",
    "dynamical relativistic problems have also been studied utilizing spectral methods ( with respect to the spatial directions , combined with finite difference methods in time direction ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "( for a comprehensive overview of the applications of spectral methods in general relativity see @xcite . )",

    ", i.e. conformally compactified space - times , was introduced by penrose @xcite in 1964 ( for an overview on this topic see  @xcite ; numerical studies can be found in @xcite ) . within this scheme",
    "we are able to carry out the numerical calculations up to infinity . as a consequence",
    ", we have no need of numerical outer boundaries at a finite physical distance . at such finite boundaries",
    "one usually imposes particular conditions in order to complete the mathematical problem .",
    "these conditions have to be compatible with the differential equation to be solved and should lead to a well - posed problem .",
    "( pseudospectral methods are particularly sensitive with respect to this issue . in the worst case ,",
    "the numerical simulation breaks down after some time when the errors arising due to incompatible boundary conditions accumulate . )",
    "however , in any case the physical meaning of such boundary data and their influence to the solution is unclear .",
    "that is why we prefer the conformal compactification .",
    "an additional important feature of the conformal approach is the precise determination of gravitational wave signals at null infinity @xmath0 , which is located at _",
    "finite coordinate distance_. hence one avoids approximative wave extraction techniques at _ finite physical distance_.    within the conformal concept , hyperbolic differential equations become singular at null infinity .",
    "although it is possible to carry out an appropriate regularization in some special cases ( for einstein s field equations , a suitable reformulation in terms of friedrich s regular conformal field equations  @xcite can be used ) , we demonstrate here that this degeneration of the equations permits a careful numerical treatment .",

    "in this section we describe the numerical procedure for solving the wave equation with the boundary conditions and or for the two types of mathematical problems  the hyperboloidal ibvp and the cauchy problem ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ibvp ] ) .",
    "the numerical method consists of the following ingredients :    1 .",
    "mapping of the physical domain onto a unit square ( or onto several unit squares ) by introducing appropriate coordinate transformations .",
    "the coordinates being defined on the unit square(s ) are referred to as _",
    "spectral coordinates_. 2 .",
    "expressing the wave function  @xmath39 in terms of another unknown function such that the initial conditions are satisfied automatically .",
    "3 .   expansion of this unknown function in terms of a truncated series of _ chebyshev polynomials _ with respect to the spectral coordinates .",
    "a particular finite resolution for the numerical approximation is chosen and appropriate grid points in the spectral coordinates on the unit square(s ) are identified .",
    "4 .   formulation of an _ algebraic system of equations _ for the values of the unknown function at the coordinate grid points .",
    "this system results from the evaluation of the wave equation and the boundary conditions within the spectral approximation scheme being chosen .",
    "calculation of the solution of this system by means of the _ newton - raphson method_.    these points are described in some detail in the following subsections .",
    "smooth functions can be expressed in terms of spectral chebyshev expansions provided these functions are defined on an interval or , for more - dimensional functions , on a cross product of intervals .",
    "for this reason we introduce an appropriate coordinate mapping through which the physical domain is obtained as the image of the unit square ( in the 1 + 1-dimensional problem considered here ) .    for the hyperboloidal ibvp we use the coordinate transformation",

    "therefore , in the case of the standard cauchy problem , it is necessary to introduce a singular coordinate mapping through which the wave function becomes analytic with respect to the spectral coordinates . to this end",

    "@xmath39 is then analytic everywhere in the domain of dependence . in particular",
    ", for the standard cauchy problem it follows that @xmath39 possesses a continuous and differentiable transition at @xmath65 .",
    "the particular choice of the spectral coordinates is not unique .",
    "also the boundary @xmath65 ( in the cauchy problem ) could have been chosen to be at a different location ( e.g. at @xmath66 with @xmath67 ) .",
    "although our choice ( @xmath68 ) represents a _ characteristic _ curve of the wave equation , in general the curve does not need to possess specific features with respect to the underlying equation .      a prescribed set of initial conditions for the wave equation , to be imposed at @xmath41 ( i.e. at @xmath57 ) , can be satisfied automatically through a specific ansatz for the wave function @xmath39 . for given functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 we replace @xmath39 ,",

    "for example , at @xmath102 , the condition @xmath103 reduces to @xmath104 which is already satisfied for the spherically symmetric initial data .",

    "[ sec_alg ] ) @xmath189 and @xmath190 note that in the limit @xmath191 one recovers the boundary conditions of the _ linear _ wave equation .    as an example we choose the particular solution obtained for @xmath131",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ plotnl ] in [ appendix ] ) .",
    "again , we read off the corresponding initial data and apply our numerical method to solve the ibvp .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ solnonlin ] .",
    "we have solved the hyperboloidal ibvp for both a small and a large time interval ( left and right panel in fig .  [ solnonlin ] ) .",
    "one finds a numerical accuracy of about @xmath192 to @xmath193 correct digits .",
    "hence , the solution is nearly as precise as the corresponding example solution of the _ linear _ wave equation with @xmath131 , cf .",
    "an important point in the preceding discussion of the wave equation is the degeneracy at @xmath0 , which is a consequence of the conformal approach .",
    "this degeneracy provided us with a particular first order boundary condition to be imposed at @xmath0 .",
    "as an alternative to the numerical solution of this _ singular _ equation , we investigate in this section a _",
    "regularized _ version .",
    "the motivation behind this study is our future goal of solving the einstein equations numerically on a conformally compactified space - time .",
    "note that a regular formulation of einstein s equations can be identified ( friedrich s regular conformal field equations , @xcite ) .    for the derivation of the regularized wave equation , consider two conformally related @xmath83-dimensional metrics @xmath194 and @xmath195 with @xmath196 where @xmath197 is a conformal factor .",
    "then , the relation @xmath198 holds , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath199 and @xmath10 denote the ricci scalars of the two conformal metrics , and @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the wave operators and @xmath202 . ] . in our case",
    "we choose @xmath203 [ cf .  ] . with @xmath204 , @xmath44 ( flat minkowski space - time ) , @xmath205 , and with the definition @xmath206",
    "we obtain @xmath207 hence , equivalently to the singular equation @xmath208 , we may study the regular equation @xmath209    this equation does _ not _ reduce to a first order boundary condition at @xmath32 . for the completeness of the algebraic system discussed in section [ sec_alg ] we therefore need to require the nonlinear second order wave equation as a condition there .",
    "( this second order boundary condition can be imposed since no information from outside  can encounter the numerical domain , i.e. no ingoing characteristic crosses the boundary in question . )",
    "again we study an explicit example by looking at the hyperboloidal ibvp ( c ) in tab .",
    "[ tab ] , but this time we solve the _ regular _ wave equation .",
    "it turns out that this formulation of the problem also permits highly accurate numerical solutions .",
    "however , instead of @xmath138 correct numerical digits ( as in fig .",
    "[ solaf]c ) we obtain @xmath193 digits , thereby loosing one order in the numerical accuracy .    note that @xmath210 possesses a similar accuracy as the normal derivative @xmath97 with respect to ingoing characteristics . in particular ,",
    "the content of outgoing radiation at @xmath32 , described by @xmath211 is similarly precisely given by @xmath210 ( calculated from the regularized wave equation ) and by @xmath97 ( calculated from the singular wave equation ) .",
    "we conclude that , remarkably , our spectral algorithm is applicable to both regular and degenerate wave equations . for the fully spectral scheme , the particular formulation of a given equation seems to play a subordinate role .",
    "in this paper , we constructed numerical solutions of hyperbolic equations utilizing a fully pseudospectral scheme . combining this method with the concept of conformal infinity",
    ", we were able to obtain highly accurate solutions .",
    "interestingly , by means of the method presented , hyperbolic equations can be handled quite similarly to elliptic equations .",
    "there is no principal difference between the treatment of the spatial coordinate @xmath55 and that of the time coordinate @xmath56 in the chebyshev approximation .",
    "the formulation of boundary / initial values is , however , fundamentally different for elliptic and hyperbolic problems . in an elliptic problem , at each boundary _ one _ first order condition is required , i.e. a condition which contains no second order normal derivative with respect to the boundary in question . on the other hand",
    ", a hyperbolic problem requires knowledge of the unknown function and its normal ( time- ) derivative at the initial slice , i.e. _ two _ first order conditions there .",
    "the future boundary @xmath42 is treated like an interior point , i.e. the hyperbolic equation provides a second order condition there .",
    "note that any attempt to impose a first order condition at this boundary must fail  not only for our pseudospectral algorithm but for any numerical scheme .",
    "the method being presented possesses a highly implicit character .",
    "the time evolution is not performed successively , moving from one time slice to the next , but the entire system is solved simultaneously instead . as a consequence , it turned out that for all our numerical examples it was not necessary to respect a courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition .",
    "in fact , the spatial collocation points could be distributed much more densely than the time points .",
    "we have demonstrated that for solutions which admit a rapidly converging chebyshev expansion , the method leads to an accuracy of up to @xmath138 or @xmath212 correct digits ( for a double precision code ) . in all examples",
    "being discussed , the numerical error ( @xmath121 ) is close to the analytical error ( @xmath127 ) , i.e. the algorithm proves to be very effective .",
    "furthermore , a geometric convergence rate is exhibited , i.e. the error decreases exponentially with the resolution .",
    "our results encourage us to attempt to develop similar numerical techniques to solve the dynamical einstein equations . as an interesting area of application",
    "we envision time evolution problems of perturbed axisymmetric equilibrium configurations ( as e.g. rotating stars , rings or black holes with surrounding matter ) .",
    "consequently , the method would permit a highly accurate stability analysis of such objects and a careful investigation of the emitted gravitational waves at @xmath0 .    in order to apply our pseudospectral scheme to such problems",
    ", it will be necessary to cover the space - time with more than a single computational domain .",
    "( at least separate domains for matter and vacuum regions are required . ) for the treatment of non - spherically symmetric equations ( i.e. higher dimensional problems ) , the computationally expensive direct matrix inversion in the newton raphson method needs to be replaced by an iterative inversion method , as already mentioned earlier .",
    "we believe that through the implementation of appropriate technical details our method becomes applicable to the solution of such physically interesting problems .",
    "we would like to thank helmut friedrich , jrme novak , silvano bonazzola , and david petroff for many valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through the collaborative research centre sfb / tr7 gravitational wave astronomy .",
