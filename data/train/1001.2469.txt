    "the hard inelastic exclusive photo(electro ) production processes : @xmath11 with a large rapidity gap and proton dissociation into hadrons draw a lot of attention recently ( v is vector @xmath12 meson , charmonium @xmath13 , or bottomium ) .",
    "( such processes can be dubbed hard inelastic diffractive ( hid ) processes , in order to distinguish them from the diffractive processes , when the final particle remain a proton : @xmath14 ) .",
    "these processes with @xmath15 were extensively studied experimentally at hera @xcite due to a reasonably large cross section and a clean final state - production of an isolated charmonium state with large transverse momentum which is separated from the proton remnants by a large rapidity gap .",
    "theoretically this process is advantageous , since the large charmonium mass @xmath16 makes it possible to evaluate cross section of the process in perturbative qcd , for different values of transverse momentum transfer @xmath1 and virtuality of the photon @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the qcd factorization theorem has been proved @xcite for diffractive photo ( electro ) production of vector mesons at least for the case of the longitudinal photon putting the calculations of diffractive cross sections on the solid theoretical basis .",
    "processes where proton remains intact are strongly suppressed at large @xmath4 by the nucleon form factor and will be considered briefly only .",
    "moreover , the charmonium photoproduction is to be probed soon at ultraperipheral collisions at lhc @xcite for significantly larger energies .",
    "the cms and atlas detectors are well suited for such an investigation since they cover large rapidity intervals",
    ". the alice detector may be capable of studying this process in a certain rapidity range as well .",
    "phenomenological analysis of the h1 and zeus data on diffractive charmonium production @xcite , carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite within framework of the qcd factorization theorem has demonstrated that the experimental data can be described if the energy dependence of two body pqcd scattering amplitude would be significantly slower at large @xmath1 , than at @xmath17 .",
    "recently , a new experimental data on the photoproduction process @xmath18 was reported @xcite .",
    "this data also indicate a rather dramatic slowing down of the dependence of the cross section of this process on the energy with increase of @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent within the experimental uncertainties with the phenomenological analysis of ref .",
    "the observed behavior differs @xcite from the predictions which assumed that the energy dependence of the amplitudes describing two body processes @xmath19 can be evaluated in terms of the bfkl approximation with the coupling constant independent of t @xcite , or with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the novel qcd effect discovered in this paper is that the pattern of energy dependence of cross section of the hid on @xmath4 , observed at hera , follows from the dglap approximation of pqcd .",
    "the amplitude of the hard two body collisions has a rather simple form in a wide interval of high energies where the double logarithmic ( dl ) approximation is legitimate : f = f_dl(x_1,x_2 , m^2_x , t , q^2 , m^2_v)f(x , m^2_x , t ) .",
    "[ f ] within the dglap approximation @xcite the function @xmath21 is obtained by summing large @xmath22 terms , that arise in the integration over parton transverse momenta in the domain where @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the parton involved in the large @xmath4 elastic scattering .",
    "variables @xmath25 are the fractions of the proton momentum carried by gluons exchanged in @xmath4 channel which are attached to a parton of the proton ( for the explicit definition of @xmath26 see section 2 . ) . since at large @xmath4 transverse momenta of exchanged gluons are large , @xmath25 are not vastly different .",
    "note that it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite , that increasing with energy dl terms provide a good description of the structure functions of proton measured at small @xmath27 at hera .",
    "this observation suggests that at hera energies @xmath28 .",
    "( we normalise @xmath21 and @xmath29 in such a way that @xmath30 at low energies . )",
    "the function @xmath28 within the lo dglap approximation to pqcd , but it is a function of energy within the bfkl and resummation models @xcite . this is because these approaches take into account the contributions that increase with the energy but do not contain double logarithmic ( dl ) terms .",
    "we estimate energy dependence of @xmath29 in the paper .",
    "the effect is small at hera energies but may become noticeable at significantly higher energies .    in the kinematic region @xmath31 the energy dependence of hard amplitudes is determined by @xmath21 .",
    "the equation [ f ] differs in this kinematic range from the pomeron exchange expression @xmath32 often used to describe the data .",
    "in particular , dl approximation predicts strong dependence of phenomenological @xmath33 on @xmath5 and on incident energy ( i.e. non universality , dependence on the external conditions ) .",
    "this non universality of @xmath34 specific for dglap approximation has been observed at hera at @xmath17 @xcite : f_2(x , q^2)~(r(q^2)(1/x ) ) , r(q^2)~0.05(q^2/^2 ) . [ x ]    in the kinematical region @xmath35 , @xmath21 is energy independent .",
    "hence the energy dependence of the cross section is determined by the function @xmath29 which does not contain large logarithms from the integration over parton transverse momenta and which is equal to one at hera energies .",
    "thus pqcd predicts a sharp decrease with @xmath1 of the rate of the rise with energy of the photo(electro ) production cross sections as compared to forward scattering at hera energies .",
    "the estimates of the kinematic range dominated by double logarithms @xcite show that the universal pomeron behavior may be valid only for the energies well beyond the kinematical region : @xmath36 occupied by double logarithms , i.e. when the dl terms disappear . at @xmath37",
    "this condition corresponds to the kinematics far beyond the kinematical range of hera .",
    "the explicit analysis of the phase - space constraints on the multi regge kinematics due to the energy - momentum conservation shows that even at ultraperipheral processes at the lhc ( where @xmath38 down to @xmath39 can be reached ) these constraints limit the possibility of the onset of the pomeron behavior to the kinematic range @xmath35 . it will be very interesting to look for onset of a pomeron behavior in pqcd in ultraperipheral collisions in this particular kinematic region .",
    "let us note that the dominance of the dl terms at small @xmath27 in a wide kinematical range is a common feature of dglap , one of saddle points in the improved bfkl , and the resummation models ( see the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the improved bfkl approach @xcite double logarithmic terms",
    "are accounted properly in the same way as in the resummation models .",
    "thus the energy dependence given by@xmath21 should disappear with increase of @xmath1 in all approaches as long as the contribution of the bfkl saddle point can be neglected .",
    "in other words , our results will remain quantitatively correct also in these approaches if one treats correctly the collinear terms and includes the energy momentum conservation constraints .",
    "the difference may reveal itself only at the energies far beyond hera . on the contrary",
    "the contribution of the bfkl saddle point @xcite in the inverse mellin transformation has no dl terms and therefore it does not lead to a peculiar dependence on @xmath4 of the rate of increase of the cross section with energy discussed in the paper .",
    "we solve the dglap evolution equations in the form of the dl approximation in a large interval of @xmath4 .",
    "it is known that the dl approximation gives quantitative description of the hera data on the structure functions of a proton @xcite .",
    "technically , the main effect related to the increase of @xmath1 is the following . in the case of @xmath17 the strong energy dependence of qcd cross section arises because the energy dependent terms @xmath40 are enhanced by the factor @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an initial virtuality .",
    "this factor originates from the integration over transverse momenta in the range @xmath43 . for @xmath44 the effective range of integration changes to @xmath45 , leading to the decrease of the rate of the energy increase with the increase of @xmath1 . at @xmath46",
    "the dl terms disappear all together .",
    "then the energy dependence may arise due to either nonperturbative initial condition for qcd evolution or the terms that do not contain integration over large transverse momenta .",
    "since the intermediate state invariant mass of the @xmath47 system at large @xmath1 is significantly larger then the masses of charmonium states we can approximate @xmath48 at @xmath49 with unequal @xmath25 by the nonforward parton distribution with @xmath50 .",
    "it was shown that at small @xmath27 and large scale controlling hardness of the process this approximation does not introduce significant uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the nonforward parton distributions for diffractive z boson production were studied also in ref .",
    "@xcite in the kinematical region : @xmath51 which differs from the kinematical region of hid ( @xmath52 ) considered in this paper .",
    "cross section of this process is strongly suppressed at large t as compared to that for hid by the square of nucleon form factor",
    ". moreover impulse approximation = qcd factorization should be modified at large t where two gluon scattering off two different partons becomes preferable .",
    "besides , the dependence on the running coupling constant derived in our paper within dglap approximation , differs from the one suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the onset of the black disc limit for the processes with large rapidity gap may occur in the kinematics where @xmath24 would be sufficiently small , i.e. in the kinematics where the gap between @xmath2 and the system @xmath53 is relatively small .",
    "the distinctive signature of this regime is a significantly slower decrease of cross section with @xmath1 as compared to pqcd regime .",
    "note also that in the black regime inelastic diffraction is suppressed . in the discussed process",
    "this will lead to a further slowing down of the increase of the cross section with energy at fixed @xmath54 or perhaps even to a decrease of the cross section with energy .",
    "this effect is amplified with increase of @xmath55 since the transverse distribution of gluons becomes more localized in the transverse plane .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the kinematics of the hid process . in sec .",

    "iv we evaluate the energy dependence of the amplitudes of hard diffractive processes for the kinematics achieved at hera . in sec .",
    "v we discuss briefly dependence on energy of the cross section of dvcs process as a function of @xmath4 . in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the directions for the future progress .",
    "the theoretical framework for the calculation of inelastic diffractive processes in the high energy processes has been developed in the seventies and it is the so called triple - pomeron limit @xcite . the original approach used independence of pomeron trajectory on external conditions - the property of the soft qcd .",
    "it has been understood later @xcite how these ideas can be adjusted to evaluate the cross sections of the hard processes with large rapidity gap directly in pqcd where the qcd factorization substitutes the pomeron pole factorization .",
    "the analogue of the triple `` pomeron '' vertex is calculable within the pqcd ( see fig .  1 and discussion below ) .",
    "the natural variables in these processes are the the invariant mass of hadronic states produced in the proton dissociation @xmath56 , the square of the transverse momentum transfer @xmath57 and the square of the invariant energy for @xmath58 elastic scattering : ss_q|q+ `` parton   j''=x_js - q^2 , [ k1 ] @xmath59 is an invariant energy squared of a full proton - photon system .",
    "these quantities are connected by the kinematic relation x_j =- t/(m^2_x - m^2_p - t ) , [ int ] the rapidity gap for sufficiently large momentum transfer -t and invariant energy s is given by y=. [ k3 ] finally , there exists a kinematical boundary on @xmath1 . for the forward scattering in the kinematics",
