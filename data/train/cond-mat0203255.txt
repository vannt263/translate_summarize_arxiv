    "latest advances in nanotechnology make it possible to growth quantum dot  ( qd ) superlattices  @xcite . in view of the analogy between atoms and qds",
    ", it is expected that strongly confined levels overlap when qds are closely packed .",
    "although this analogy can not be complete since carriers in qds are influenced by phonons , defects and interface states , the resulting collective levels will depend on the particular arrangement of qds . in this sense",
    ", qd arrays grown by molecular beam epitaxy can be completely random  @xcite , partially regimented  @xcite or may be regularly stacked ( high regimentation )  @xcite .",
    "electronic states in highly regimented qds are adequately described within envelope - function approximation with a three dimensional kronig - penney model and the occurrence of miniband have been established  @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of periodicity observed in random qds superlattices demands different approaches .    in the present work",
    "we introduce a two - dimensional effective - mass model to study the effects of scattering by disorder on electron transmission through random quantum - dots superlattices . to this end ,",
    "the ben daniel - duke equation is discretized , boundary conditions are discussed and scattering solutions are found by means of the transfer - matrix method for _ any _ arbitrary array of qds . the model is worked out in a two - dimensional space for computational limitations , although it will be clear that generalization to three dimensions is rather straightforward .",
    "finally , we present the numerical results for the transmission coefficient through random arrays of coupled qds and the main conclusions of the work .",
    "we consider the ben daniel - duke equation with constant effective mass @xmath0 at the @xmath1 valley for the electron envelope function @xmath2 . in order to find numerically the single electron states ,",
    "the whole sample is divided into three different regions , namely left ( i ) and right ( iii ) contacts and the random qds ( ii ) , where scattering by disorder takes place .",
    "figure  1 shows a schematic view of the three spatial regions .",
    "we then consider a mesh with lattice spacings @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , respectively .",
    "defining @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we obtain the following discrete effective - mass equation @xmath9 the potential term @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) is given by the conduction - band edge energy at the point @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , disorder enters the equation through this diagonal term .",
    "contacts are characterized by flat band conditions , @xmath12 , in the absence of applied electric field .",
    "clearly , the effects of the applied field can be easily taken into account within the present approach by adding a linearly varying potential of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the applied field .",
    "in order to solve the tight binding - like equation  ( [ discrete ] ) we use the transfer matrix method based on the solutions calculated for each slide of the system along the @xmath6 direction . for the sake of simplicity in the calculation , we define @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) as a vector whose components are @xmath17 ( m=1,  ,m ) . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the number of mesh divisions in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , respectively .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ discrete ] ) can be cast in a more compact form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 identity and null matrices respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 splits into the form @xmath25 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix @xmath26 are @xmath27 while nonvanishing off - diagonal elements equal @xmath28 .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 depends on the boundary conditions to be specified later .",
    "we can obtain the expression of the envelope function amplitudes in the left contact as a function of the amplitudes in the right one @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the transfer matrix for the heterostructure .",
    "the envelope functions within the contacts will be determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions are open in the @xmath6 direction , and periodic on each slide , namely in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "consequently , all elements of @xmath26 vanish except @xmath32 .",
    "the former conditions imply plane wave solutions in the @xmath6 axis , and the latter yield an energy discretization on @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "this discretization results in a number of transverse channels equal to the number of points in the transverse mesh direction . considering @xmath10 to be constant at the contacts , that is , considering perfect leads so no voltage drop occurs within regions i and iii , and setting @xmath33 , a particular solution of eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) is given by    @xmath34    at the left contact while at the right contact we have @xmath35    where the normalization constant is choosen to ensure that all the _ propagating _ modes carry the same current @xmath36 and @xmath37 + 1 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] these expressions remain valid for an applied electric field @xmath14 provided the electronic momentum @xmath38 is substituted within region @xmath39 in the following way @xmath40 + 1 \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the lenght of region @xmath43 .",
    "the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 appearing in equations ( [ solutioni ] ) and ( [ solutioniii ] ) are the _ reflection _ and _ transmission _ matrices and they are responsible for the channel _ mixing _ due to scattering events .",
    "thus , @xmath46 represents the probability amplitude for an electron impinging in channel @xmath47 to be reflected into the chanel @xmath48 .",
    "note that the solution within region ii is unknown .",
    "actually , we are not interested in this solution since all the physics of the scattering problem is contained in the _ mixing _ matrices @xmath45 and @xmath44 . in particular",
    ", we can compute the conductance . from the landauer - bttiker formalism@xcite",
    ", the zero temperature two - leads multichannel conductance can be calculated using de fisher - lee formula  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the trace of the matrix .",
    "in order to describe epitaxially random qd superlattices , we consider they are arranged on a nonregular lattice ( configurational disorder ) .",
    "but , in addition , there exists another source of disorder due to spatial inhomogeneities that make the shape to be slightly different ( morphological disorder ) . to mimic both types of disorder we assume an array of rectangular qds , randomly displaced from the regular lattice sites , whose size also change randomly from dot to dot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to avoid the profusion of free parameters , we consider that the energy of the confinement potential @xmath51 provided by the high bandgap semiconductor is the same for every qd .",
    "this is not a serious shortcoming since spatial inhomogeneities of the conduction - band offset and fluctuations of individual qds shapes yield essentially the same results .",
    "in addition , our model could easily deal with nonconstant values of @xmath51 if further improvements are required .",
    "we will separate the effects of configurational and morphological disorder for the sake of clarity .",
    "configurational disorder means that every qd shifts its position @xmath52 while its size @xmath53 remains unchanged ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are random uncorrelated variables with zero mean and distributed according to box probability functions of width @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . to simulate the change of the shape ( morphological disorder ) we consider that the qd is enlarged along the @xmath58 axis an amount @xmath59 while its center stays on a regular lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , where @xmath59 is uniformly distributed with zero mean and width @xmath60 .",
    "as a working example , we have performed several numerical calculations in order to study the effect of both configurational and morphological disorder over the conductance of random qds superlattices made of gaas - in@xmath61ga@xmath62as heterojunctions .",
    "we have considered regimented and disordered @xmath63 arrays of qds to elucidate the effects of randomness .",
    "the conduction - band offset , @xmath51 , is taken to be @xmath64 of the difference of the gaps @xmath65 in strained gaas - in@xmath61ga@xmath62as heterojunctions , where @xmath66ev .",
    "for definiteness we set @xmath67 and consequently @xmath68ev .",
    "in addition , since we are mainly interested in the effects of the coupling between the qds through the high bandgap semiconductor rather in the confined levels of individual qd , we have taken @xmath69 in units of the bare electron mass , corresponding to the embedding semiconductor .",
    "let us mention that the the model can be easily generalized to include a different effective mass inside the qds .",
    "the size of the regimented qds is @xmath70 with @xmath71 nm and @xmath72 nm . the separation between centers in the regimented array is @xmath73 and @xmath74 nm along the @xmath75 and @xmath58 axes , respectively .",
    "the number of mesh points along the two spatial directions are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    as typical results of our simulations , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the conductance versus fermi energy , measured from the conduction - band edge in in@xmath61ga@xmath62as , in the absence of applied field .",
    "solid line corresponds to regimented qds .",
    "the coupling between the qds splits the energy levels and results in the formation of minibands  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we observe the occurrence of two well - defined minibands below the barrier when disorder is absent , in agreement with previous results  @xcite .",
    "each band is characterized by four main conductance peaks and each peak is the convolution of four peaks that can not be resolved except for the lower one in the higher miniband ( see inset of fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "transport though the miniband changes as soon as some degree of randomness is considered in the model , as expected .",
    "mean size and separation between qds as well as fluctuations around those values strongly depend on the growth conditions ( e.g. growth temperature ) and subsequent thermal treatments  @xcite . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the conductance for configurational ( @xmath78 nm and @xmath79 nm ) and morphological ( @xmath80 nm ) disorder , obtained by averaging over @xmath81 realizations of the disorder . as a main point",
    ", we notice that electronic states in the array of random qds behaves like an amorphous material since the conductance strongly decreases while the allowed energies broadens due to the fluctuations of qd energy levels for each realization of the disorder .    concerning the effects of a uniform applied electric field ,",
    "we have computed the conductance for a given fermi energy ( @xmath82ev ) as a function of the applied bias @xmath83 .",
    "the potential was assumed to drop uniformly across region  ii .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the conductance versus applied bias for regimented as well as random qd superlattices .",
    "regimented qd superlattices present three well - defined negative @xmath84 regions due to resonant tunneling through the qds .",
    "the observed peak - to - valley ratios become worse as soon as disorder is included in the calculation , especially in the case of configurational disorder .",
    "in summary , we have presented a method to study electron transport through random qd superlattices .",
    "the method is based on the transfer matrix formalism applied to the discrete ben daniel - duke hamiltonian for the electron envelope function .",
    "a careful analysis of the scattering solutions under appropriate boundary conditions ( periodic and open along the lateral and longitudinal directions , respectively ) allows us to obtain the two - channel conductance . for regimented qds ( regular array of qds )",
    "the conductance shows clear signatures of the miniband structure , as previously predicted by a kronig - penney model for strongly coupled qds  @xcite .",
    "however , the novelty of the model lies in the fact that random qd superlattices can also be studied . to this end",
    ", two models of disorder ( configurational and morphological ) have been introduced .",
    "disorder reduces the conductance due to anderson localization of the envelope functions and broadens the allowed energy bands .",
    "the characteristic @xmath85@xmath83 presents several regions of negative @xmath84 , although the peak - to - valley ratios strongly decrease due to disorder .",
