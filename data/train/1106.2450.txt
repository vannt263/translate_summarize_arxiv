    "another important local characteristic of the vacuum state is the vev of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "similar to the field squared , the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is decomposed into pure topological and boundary induced parts . in the analysis of vev of the energy - momentum tensor ,",
    "only integer value of @xmath38 has been considered in this paper .",

    "the normal vacuum force acting on the plate is determined by the component @xmath114 evaluated on the boundary .",
    "this force is given by the expression ( [ pressure1 ] ) for massive fields , and by ( [ pressure2 ] ) for massless ones .",
    "note that for a flat boundary in minkowski spacetime the normal stress vanishes and the effective force in the geometry under consideration is induced by the presence of the string .",
    "for massless field in a @xmath115dimensional cosmic string spacetime the pressure is given by ( [ pressure3 ] ) .",
    "the analytical results obtained in this paper explicitly show that the presence of a cosmic string increases the vacuum polarization effects induced by the boundary when compared with the corresponding ones in minkowski spacetime .",
