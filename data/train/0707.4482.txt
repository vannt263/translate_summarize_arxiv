    "strong evidence has been unearthed by many independent studies , spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum , that powerful ( @xmath16whz@xmath17 ) high - redshift ( @xmath18 ) radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) are the progenitors of today s massive spheroids and giant ellipticals , seen in the early stages of their formation .",
    "large radio luminosities indicate the presence of a supermassive black hole , while deep near - ir observations betray large stellar masses , making hzrgs amongst the most massive known baryonic systems in the distant universe ( e.g.  best , longair & rttgering 1998 ; de breuck et al .  2002 ; seymour et al .  2007 ) .",
    "another extreme property of hzrgs is the preponderance of luminous , morphologically complex ly@xmath14 halos , extending up to 200kpc from the central radio galaxies ( e.g.  reuland et al .",
    "2004 ) . in several cases ,",
    "strong hi absorption has been seen in ly@xmath14 , suggestive of vast reservoirs of neutral gas ( e.g.  hippelein & meisenheimer 1993 ; van oijk et al .",
    "1997 ; de breuck et al .  2003 ; wilman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the first pointed submillimeter ( submm ) observations of hzrgs demonstrated that a large fraction of such systems are extremely luminous in the rest - frame far - ir waveband ( @xmath19 ) and contain large amounts of dust ( @xmath20  dunlop et al .",
    "1994 ; chini & krgel 1994 ; ivison et al .  1995 ; hughes , dunlop & rawlings 1997 ) .",

    "( 2001 ) and reuland et al .",
    "( 2004 ) confirmed these initial findings and showed that the dust content of hzrgs , as gauged by the 850-@xmath0 m luminosity , increases strongly with redshift : @xmath21 out to @xmath22 .",
    "this was interpreted as a tendency for hzrgs to host younger stellar populations at higher redshifts since far - ir luminosities can be powered by either an agn or starburst activity but large dust masses require vigorous recent star formation . even though hzrgs undoubtedly host powerful agns , starburst activity is therefore known to contribute substantially to their extreme far - ir luminosities",
    "; indeed , the lack of a correlation between radio power and submm luminosity seems to exclude a scenario in which the agn is the dominating power source ( archibald et al .",
    "furthermore , a handful of hzrgs are known to harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas ( @xmath23  e.g.  papadopoulos et al .",

    "this revealed extended ( @xmath2430kpc ) dust emission around the central radio galaxies and an apparent over - density of smgs ( by a factor of two compared to blank - field surveys ) , suggestive of many vigorous starbursts occuring within a few mpc of the central hzrgs .    these observational data all tally with current models of hierarchical structure formation , in which galaxy formation is anti - hierarchical and heavily biased towards regions of high density .",
    "the various source over - densities suggest hzrgs are excellent markers of the densest and most vigorous star - forming regions in the early universe .",
    "hzrgs thus constitute an important population for benchmarking current models of galaxy formation , particularly at the high - mass end .",
    "the suitability of hzrgs for probing galaxy formation and evolution is furthered by the fact that hzrgs are 1 ) possible to identify in low - frequency radio surveys as ultra - steep - spectrum ( uss ) radio sources ( chambers et al.1996 ; de breuck et al .",
    "2000 ) which , when combined with near - ir colour criteria , provide a highly efficient and relatively unbiased ( in particular with respect to their dust properties ) selection scheme , and 2 ) have accurate radio positions and extreme properties ( e.g.large rest - frame optical luminosities ) which aid their study .",

    "it should be noted that while we have been unable to obtain a spectroscopic redshift for j065051.4 , we feel that the likelihood of this source not being part of the same system as 4c41.17 is small , given its proximity to the radio galaxy and the fact that weak , extended ( sub)mm emission is seen to bridge the two sources ( appendix a , fig .",

    "2000 ) . nevertheless , labs such as j065043.4 , with ly@xmath14 emission extending beyond @xmath84kpc , are very rare ; only a dozen or so have been found .",
    "it is unclear what powers these very extended labs .",
    "plausible explanations are a large - scale superwind stemming from a massive , dust - enshrouded starburst ( taniguchi & shioya 2000 ; ohyama et al .",
    "2003 ) , a buried qso ( haiman & rees 2001 ; weidinger et al .",
    "2005 ) , or simply cooling radiation from infalling gas within a dark matter halo ( e.g.  haiman et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "j065043.4 is undetected at 24-@xmath0 m  unusual but not unique for an smg ; its single emission line , ly@xmath14 , is perfectly normal ( chapman et al .  2005 ) .",
    "it is the third known submm - bright lab and all three have different properties  typical of this intriguing , heterogeneous population ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "a more detailed study of j065043.4 is in progress ( greve et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "we have conducted wide - field imaging at ( sub)mm , mid - ir and radio wavelengths of the luminous , @xmath85 radio galaxy , 4c41.17 .",
    "in addition to the radio galaxy itself , we robustly confirm two bright sources previously detected by scuba in its immediate vicinity .",
    "of another three very faint sources detected by scuba , we tentatively confirm one at 350-@xmath0 m .",
    "a further nine sources are detected ( at the 3.5-@xmath3 level ) at 1200-@xmath0 m in this field .",
    "thus a total of 14 ( sub)mm galaxies are found within a @xmath86 radius of 4c41.17 .",
    "using our radio and 24-@xmath0 m data we find statistically significant counterparts to 8/14 ( 57 per - cent ) of our smgs .",
    "we targeted six of these robust counterparts spectroscopically using lris on keck , and were able to infer reliable spectroscopic redshifts in four cases .",
    "all four were found to lie at redshifts well below that of the radio galaxy , thus ruling out any physical association with 4c41.17 . comparing the spectroscopic redshifts with redshifts derived from the 1.6-@xmath0 m stellar feature suggest that the latter is a reliable photometric redshift indicator . of four smgs with no spectroscopic redshifts",
    "we use the 1.6-@xmath0 m stellar bump to estimate their redshifts and find only one to be consistent ( within the errors ) with the redshift of 4c41.17 .",
    "armed with our spectroscopic redshifts , we find that nearly half of the smgs apparently associated with 4c41.17 are in fact foreground sources .",
    "we have constrained the over - density of smgs within a 50  region of 4c41.17 to be @xmath10 that of the typical surface density observed in blank fields .",
    "this drops off as a function of distance from the radio galaxy , with an apparent scale - length of @xmath72 .",
    "deeper , wider ( sub)mm surveys of of hzrgs are needed to improve the statistics on source over - densities and to probe the filamentary structures expected to be channeling material into these regions .",
    "these surveys should be complemented by high - resolution ( sub)mm interferometry and deep radio imaging to pin - point positions determine source morphologies .",
    "finally , deep spectroscopy is required to test for membership of a hzrg - related proto - cluster , although the imminent arrival of broad - band heterodyne receivers suggests co spectroscopy may prove to be a more efficient way of determining redshifts for these smgs .",
    "we are grateful to darren dowell and colin borys for helpful discussion relating to sharc - ii observations and data reduction .",
    "we thank andrew blain for providing us with 350-@xmath0 m number counts predictions .",

    "this is further strengthened by the fact that the source also has a x - ray counterpart detected by chandra .",
    "we find the 24-/1200-@xmath0 m association to be statistically significant ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "we note that k1 , apart from being the reddest irac source and the only x - ray source within the error circle , also coincides with the peak of the ( blended ) 24-@xmath0 m emission .",

    "in fact , we find a statistically significant 1200-/24-@xmath0 m association ( @xmath95 ) for k1 .",
    "moreover , lris spectroscopy of k1 yields a redshift of @xmath96 ( fig.[figure : spectra - smgs]b ) , which is within the redshift distribution of blank - field smgs ( chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) thus further suggesting that this is the correct counterpart .",
    "it is possible , however , that k1 is part of a composite system which include the bluer component k2 . from the estimated 24-@xmath0 m flux of the third irac source within the error beam ( table 4 )",
