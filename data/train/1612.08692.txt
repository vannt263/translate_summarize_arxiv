    "constructing embedded minimal surfaces in a given @xmath2-manifold is a difficult problem . if there are incompressible surfaces in the manifold one can minimize area in the isotopy class of such a surface to produce a minimal surface by a result of meeks - simon - yau @xcite .",
    "the only technique that works in full generality with no assumptions on the metric or manifold is the min - max technique of almgren - pitts and later refined by simon - smith @xcite . in this approach",
    "one considers sweep - outs of the manifold and the smallest slice needed to  pull over \" the manifold is a smooth embedded minimal surface .",
    "recently , marques - neves have used this technique and higher parameter families to construct infinitely many minimal surfaces in manifolds with positive ricci curvature @xcite . in full generality",
    "however it is very hard to control the genus of the limiting minimal surfaces beyond the genus bounds proved in @xcite ( which built on earlier work of simon - smith @xcite and de lellis - pellandini @xcite ) .",
    "see colding - de lellis @xcite for an exposition of the min - max theory .",
    "if the manifold has some symmetries , one can hope to control the genus of the minimal surfaces produced from a min - max procedure . toward that end , in the late 80s pitts - rubinstein @xcite proposed considering the situation when one has a finite group of isometries @xmath3 acting on a @xmath2-manifold . then one can consider sweepouts where each sweepout surface is preserved by the group and run a min - max procedure that only includes such equivariant surfaces .",
    "they claimed one should be able to produce @xmath3-equivariant minimal surfaces this way .",
    "the main result of this paper ( theorem [ main ] ) is that this procedure conjectured by pitts - rubinstein in fact works .",
    "it was further proved in @xcite that after performing finitely many neck - pinch surgeries on the the min - max sequence , the remaining components align themselves as covering about the limiting minimal surfaces with the expected multiplicities .",
    "since we are restricted here to equivariant sweepouts , any neckpinch must _ also _ be equivariant .",
    "this severely limits the type of degeneration that occurs and will allow us to control the genus of the limiting minimal surfaces in most cases .",
    "in fact , we will show that in round @xmath0 , many ( if not all ) of the known embedded minimal surfaces can be generated from our equivariant min - max process .",
    "one might object that only considering equivariant deformations one should not be able to produce a surface critical with respect to _ all _ variations .",
    "but there is a very old principle in mathematics and mathematical physics formulated by palais @xcite called the  principle of symmetric criticality .",
    "\" it says roughly speaking that if one has a functional on a space with a symmetry , and there is a symmetric point in the space where the functional has zero derivative in directions that have the symmetry , then the point is actually critical with respect to all deformations .",
    "this is why one can expect to produce globally minimal surfaces when one is only looking at sweepouts and comparison surfaces that are also equivariant .",
    "+ as a simple illustration of this principle , if one has a smooth @xmath3-equivariant surface @xmath4 and the area of @xmath4 has zero variation among equivariant deformations , then we can easily show it must be a smooth minimal surface ( see theorem 1 in @xcite ) . indeed by the first variation formula , for any vector field @xmath5 defined on a neighborhood of @xmath4 we have @xmath6 since @xmath4 is equivariant ,",
    "so is the vector @xmath7 and we can thus plug @xmath7 into and obtain by stationarity among equivariant deformations : @xmath8 whence @xmath9 identically .    the idea of finding minimal surfaces in a singular quotient manifold @xmath10 and then lifting to produce a minimal surface in @xmath11 goes at least as far back as hsiang - lawson @xcite",
    "this is how w.y .",
    "hsiang constructed examples of non - equatorial minimal spheres embedded in high dimensional spheres @xcite . in previous work",
    "the analysis amounts to finding geodesics on the quotient space . to our knowledge",

    ", @xmath20 has the structure of a trivalent graph ( see for instance section 2.3.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , we can stratify the set @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 consists of geodesic segments that connect ( potentially ) in the finitely many vertices comprising the set @xmath23 .",
    "three segments meet at each point in @xmath23 . along each segment in @xmath22",
    "the isotropy subgroup is @xmath24 for some @xmath25 .",
    "points in the singular set @xmath23 look locally like a cone over a two - dimensional spherical orbifold .",
    "at such a vertex in @xmath23 where three edges are meeting ( indexed by their isotropy groups of orders @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) , we have as possibilities : @xmath29 which correspond to the classification of @xmath12-d spherical orbifolds .",
    "it will be convenient to set @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to remember that @xmath32 will not have the same trivalent structure as its projection @xmath20 .",
    "let us call a smooth connected segment in @xmath33 an _ arc of constant isotropy _ if the isotropy group at all points is the same and the segment is maximal with respect to this property .",
    "if not a closed curve , such an arc of constant isotropy has points in @xmath34 as its endpoints .",
    "+ aside from a group action , the other notion we need to state our main result is that of a @xmath3-sweepout :    [ gsweepout ] if @xmath11 is a closed @xmath2-manifold and @xmath3 a finite group of orientation - preserving isometries .",
    "a _ @xmath3-sweepout _ of @xmath11 is a family of closed sets @xmath35 , continuously varying in the hausdorff topology such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath36 is a smooth embedded surface for @xmath37 varying smoothly 2 .",

    "the surfaces @xmath36 for @xmath37 intersect @xmath32 transversally    in fact , v. forces the surfaces to intersect @xmath33 orthogonally .",
    "it follows that for @xmath37 , each surface @xmath36 intersects each arc of constant isotropy a fixed number of times ( see lemma [ intersect3 ] ) .",
    "note that iv .",
    "is already implied by lemma [ actions ] and the fact that the surfaces @xmath36 are smooth .",
    "given such a @xmath3-sweepout @xmath35 we may define the @xmath3-equivariant saturation @xmath44 identically as in @xcite except where  isotopy \" is replaced by ",
    "equivariant isotopy \" ( see definition [ eqisotopy ] ) .",
    "we can then define the min - max width ( where throughout this paper @xmath45 denotes @xmath12-dimensional hausdorff measure ) : @xmath46}\\mathcal{h}^2(\\lambda_t).\\ ] ]    it follows easily as in proposition 1.4 in @xcite that @xmath47 ( one is restricting to equivariant isotopies so @xmath48 is at least as large as the non - equivariant width considered in @xcite using all isotopies ) .",
    "we can then consider a sequence of sweepouts @xmath49 the area of whose maximal slice converges to @xmath48 .",
    "from @xmath49 we may then choose a sequence of slices @xmath50 with area converging to @xmath48 .",
    "such a sequence of surfaces we will call a _ min - max sequence_.    we can now state our main results .",
    "our following theorem on equivariant min - max was announced in some form in 1988 by pitts - rubinstein @xcite but the author is not aware of a published proof .    [ main ] let @xmath11 be a closed orientable riemannian @xmath2-manifold and let @xmath3 be a finite group of orientation preserving isometries acting on @xmath11 such that @xmath10 is an orientable orbifold without boundary .",
    "let @xmath35 be a @xmath3-sweepout of @xmath11 by surfaces of genus @xmath51 .",
    "then we have the following :    1 .",
    "there exists a min - max sequence @xmath52 converging as varifolds to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are smooth embedded pairwise disjoint minimal surfaces and @xmath55 are positive integers .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 contains an embedded @xmath3-equivariant minimal surface .",
    "2 .   @xmath56 3 .   for @xmath57 large enough , after performing finitely many @xmath3-equivariant neck - pinch surgeries on @xmath52 and discarding some components , each remaining component of @xmath52 is isotopic to one of the @xmath54 or to a double cover .",
    "after this surgery process , for each @xmath58 , there are @xmath55 components of the min - max sequence isotopic to @xmath54 if @xmath54 is orientable , and @xmath59 components isotopic to a double cover if @xmath54 is non - orientable .",
    "item c ) implies the genus bound with multiplicity : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the subcollection of @xmath54 that are orientable , and @xmath62 denotes the subcollection that are non - orientable .",
    "5 .   if @xmath63 and @xmath64 then @xmath32 intersects @xmath54 orthogonally at @xmath15 .",
    "6 .   if @xmath63 and @xmath65 and either @xmath54 is orthogonal to @xmath32 or else @xmath32 is tangent to @xmath54 at @xmath15 , in which case @xmath54 has even multiplicity and @xmath54 contains the arc of constant isotropy containing @xmath15 . 7 .",
    "@xmath66 can only intersect @xmath34 at a point @xmath15 with isotropy group @xmath67 .",
    "a component of @xmath66 containing such a point has even multiplicity . in this case ,",
    "such a component contains @xmath68 of the arcs of isotropy @xmath69 intersecting at @xmath15 ( if @xmath70 , there are three possible such pairings , otherwise a unique set of such arcs ) .",
    "a few remarks about theorem [ main ] are in order :    theorem [ main ] is trivial if @xmath3 acts freely on @xmath11 , for in this case @xmath10 is a smooth manifold and one can run the min - max theory relative to a heegaard splitting of @xmath10 and lift the resulting minimal surface up to @xmath11 to produce a @xmath3-equivariant minimal surface .",
    "thus the content of the theorem is in the situation when @xmath3 acts non - freely and where @xmath10 is an orbifold .    even though only one parameter is used , because of the symmetry imposed on the sweepouts , the surfaces we produce will have high morse index in general .",
    "it would be interesting to determine this index .",
    "the surfaces we produce should have equivariant index @xmath40 .",
    "[ typeofneck]let us explain the meaning of _ @xmath3-equivariant neck - pinch surgeries _ in the statement of theorem [ main]c .",
    "such neck - pinches consist of two varieties : the first type is an _ ordinary neck - pinch _ which is the removal of a cylinder from a surface and attachment of two disks so that the union of disk and cylinder bound a ball , all disjoint from the singular set @xmath32 .",
    "if such a neck - pinch is performed , there are @xmath71 isometric copies of the neck - pinch which must also be performed concurrently to preserve equivariance . the second type of neck - pinch we call a _",
    "@xmath24-neckpinch_. here the cylinder removed is centered around an arc of isotropy @xmath24 , and the two disks one adds in each intersect the singular arc once orthogonally .",
    "the ball bounded by the two disks and cylinder contain only a piece of the arc of @xmath24 isotropy . in this case , there @xmath72 isometric copies of the neck - pinch which must be performed concurrently .    regarding items e , f , when no isotropy subgroups are @xmath69 we can prevent the min - max sequence from becoming tangent (  creasing \" into ) to the singular set .",
    "however , if the isotropy subgroup is @xmath69 at a point , the min - max sequence _ can _ potentially press into the singular set ( though we know of no instance where this actually happens ) . to see the relevance of the order of the cyclic group , consider @xmath73 acting on @xmath74 by rotations of angle @xmath75 about the z - axis .",
    "when @xmath76 , the only plane passing through the origin that is @xmath24-equivariant is the horizontal plane : @xmath77 which is perpendicular to the singular set .",
    "the problem is that for @xmath70 , any planes of the form @xmath78 is also @xmath69-equivariant . thus a stable equivariant minimal surface can _ contain _ the singular set .",
    "worse yet , for each @xmath79 one has a @xmath69-equivariant stable surface : @xmath80 that is disjoint from the singular set and yet as @xmath81 these surfaces converge with multiplicity two to the plane @xmath82 containing @xmath20 .",
    "thus in principle a min - max sequence could push with even multiplicity into the singular set .",
    "this behavior along curves of @xmath69 isotropy is not a problem for the regularity theory ( since the failure of compactness of stable @xmath69-equivariant surfaces amounts to the formation of multiplicity , which anyway is allowed in the theory ) but it is a problem when we want to control the genus of the min - max surface .",
    "for instance in order to double the clifford torus , the relevant group contains an involution that sends @xmath83 to @xmath84 in @xmath85 and creates a curve contained in a clifford torus with isotropy subgroup @xmath69 .",
    "the min - max sequence may therefore converge to the clifford torus with multiplicity two . in joint work with f. c. marques and a. neves",
    "@xcite we introduce the  catenoid estimate \" to deal with this issue that arises in the min - max approach to doubling constructions .    , stable geodesics can converge into the cone point to give a degenerate geodesic with multiplicity 2 . ]    since we will see that min - max sequences are approximated by stable minimal surfaces , another way to see why the sequences can not crease into the singular set when the isotropy group is not @xmath69 is to consider geodesics on the two - dimensional cones with cone angle @xmath86 .",
    "if the cone angle is very close to @xmath87 , stable geodesics pass through the singular point .",
    "but we are only interested in the orbifold regime where @xmath88 for some @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 , stable geodesics always avoid the singular point .",
    "the case @xmath91 is the borderline case where there exists a degenerate geodesic going from the base to the tip of the cone and back ( see figure 1 ) . the key point to take away",
    "is that @xmath69 area minimizing surfaces do satisfy a compactness theorem provided one allows the limit to have multiplicity .    after proving existence and regularity of equivariant minimal surfaces",
    ", we then apply our construction to the study of minimal surfaces in round @xmath0 .",
    "the classical minimal surfaces in @xmath0 are the equatorial two - spheres and the clifford torus and for a long time these were the only known surfaces .",
    "then in 1970 lawson produced a minimal surfaces of every genus @xcite .",
    "his technique was to study a symmetry group acting on the sphere , solve the plateau problem for a polygon inscribed in the fundamental domain of the group action , and reflect about the edges to produce a closed embedded surface .",
    "karcher - pinkall - sterling @xcite used the same technique to produce nine minimal surfaces associated with the platonic solids ( their method was somewhat different in that in each fundamental domain they solve a free - boundary problem rather than plateau problem for a fixed quadrilateral ) .",
    "more recently choe - soret @xcite used lawson s technique to produce new minimal surfaces .",
    "the only other technique that has been successful is that of kapouleas - yang @xcite who used gluing techniques to desingularize two nearby clifford tori by connecting them via many catenoidal necks . the gluing method has been applied also by wiygul @xcite who constructed minimal embeddings resembling  stacks \" of several nearby clifford tori .",
    "finally kapouleas @xcite recently succeeded in doubling the equatorial @xmath12-sphere .",
    "see brendle s survey @xcite for more discussion of these results",
    ".    we will give a min - max construction of many of these surfaces and then construct eight new infinite families that resemble doublings and desingularizations of stationary varifolds in the round @xmath2-sphere .",
    "these examples all appear in the original table in the announcement @xcite .",
    "our methods are entirely different from kapouleas and lawson s in that they are variational and global in nature  we are simply doing morse theory on the space of equivariant surfaces in a given manifold . the morse - theoretic approach is geometrically very natural , though the global nature of the sweepouts required could be a disadvantage in some cases as one can not restrict to a tubular neighborhood of the surfaces one wants to double or desingularize .",
    "one definite advantage of our methods is that while in gluing constructions one always has to take the genus inserted along desingularizing curves to be large , in the min - max setting there is no such restriction .",
    "we expect that most if not all embedded desingularizations and doublings can be given a variational interpretation .",
    "+ the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the main issues involved in the construction . in section 3",
    "we will prove a weak version in the setting of geometric measure theory of the symmetric critical points principle .",
    "this will allow us to use the  pull - tight \" argument of colding - de lellis to produce an equivariant stationary varifold .",
    "in section 4 we will prove the regularity of the stationary varifold produced by the min - max procedure . in section 5",
    "we address the topology of the limiting minimal surfaces .",
    "finally in section 6 we turn to examples and give new constructions of old minimal surfaces in @xmath0 and produce many new examples . +   + _ acknowledgements : i am grateful to renato bettiol for pointing out the work @xcite , baris coskunuzer for some conversations and brian white for some discussion of proposition [ minimizing ] .",
    "i also thank fernando marques , andr neves and toby colding for their interest in this work . _",
    "we explain the main points and difficulties of the construction in a more technical way . we will be only working with isotopies that are @xmath3-equivariant .",
    "the formal  pull - tight \" procedure of colding - de lellis allows one to work in this restricted family and produce a @xmath3-stationary varifold .",
    "we will prove that @xmath3-stationary varifolds are in fact stationary which is a weak version of the principle of symmetric criticality explained above .",
    "thus we can find min - max sequences converging to a stationary varifold @xmath92 .",
    "we then prove that our min - max sequence is almost minimizing ( in the sense introduced by almgren @xcite and later by pitts ) in annuli .",
    "this is after all an abstract purely combinatorial argument using only the metric space property of the ambient space .",
    "thus by the regularity theory in colding - de lellis @xcite we immediately obtain regularity away from @xmath32 . but a stationary varifold that is smooth away from a one - dimensional set can be quite far from being smooth  for instance two planes intersecting orthogonally in @xmath74 is @xmath93-equivariant and smooth away from a line .",
    "the point is that we _ do _ have the almost minimizing property in annuli centered around points in the singular locus of the group action @xmath32 .",
    "the only difference is that in such annuli  almost minimizing \" means restricted to isotopies that are equivariant .",
    "we can minimize among equivariant isotopies in such annuli to produce a @xmath3-equivariant minimal surface @xmath94 that is stable among equivariant deformations ( @xmath3-stable ) .",
    "but we will prove that @xmath3-stability implies stability among all variations as long as the surfaces in the sweepout intersect @xmath32 transversally , which we are assuming ( see items iv ) and v ) in definition [ gsweepout ] ) .",
    "this implication uses standard facts about the first eigenfunction of schrdinger operators .",
    "thus locally we obtain stable replacements @xmath94 and one can use the classical estimates to schoen @xcite to produce a convergent subsequence , a  replacement \" @xmath95 for @xmath96 in an annulus around the singular set .",
    "this is morally what is preventing the min - max sequence from  creasing \" to form an  x \" with multiplicity 2 .",
    "it then follows as in @xcite that a stationary varifold that has smooth replacements in the above sense is itself a smooth minimal surface .",
    "we also need that the @xmath3-stable replacements @xmath94 are in fact smooth minimal surfaces .",
    "the way this was handled in the work of colding - de lellis is by constructing smooth replacements for them and appealing to the replacement theory again .",
    "here one uses that the minimizing sequence for the restricted @xmath97-problem that was used to produce @xmath94 , is actually by a squeezing lemma minimizing among _ all _ isotopies in a small enough ball",
    ". then one can use the fact that a minimizing sequence for area ( in the sense of meeks - simon - yau @xcite ) has a smooth limit . in our case what is needed",
    "is to prove that given a small ball @xmath98 centered around @xmath20 of isotropy @xmath24 and an equivariant surface in the ball with boundary @xmath99 , one can minimize area among @xmath3-equivariant competitors to produce a smooth minimal surface with boundary @xmath100 .",
    "one can even assume the genus of @xmath4 is zero .",
    "if @xmath101 and one is thus seeking an equivariant area - minimizing disk , then it follows from the work of meeks - yau @xcite that _ any _ minimizing disk is in fact equivariant . since by almgren - simon @xcite such a minimizing disk is smooth , this would complete the proof . if @xmath102 and the curves bound multiple planar domains , the issue of whether the minimizing surface is equivariant seems more delicate . the meeks - yau cut - and - paste argument",
    "to prove that minimizers are equivariant does not appear to work ( see the example of annuli on page 227 in @xcite ) .",
    "there is a symmetrization procedure of lawson @xcite to construct from a minimizing current an equivariant current with the same area but genus may incease in this process and so it is not directly applicable to our setting .",
    "an elementary example going back to federer ( section 5.4.17 in @xcite ) in one lower dimension illustrates that the question of whether equivariant minimizers are minimizers among all competitors is quite delicate : consider four points at the vertices of a square .",
    "such a configuration is @xmath93-equivariant but the minimizing one dimensional current with such a boundary consists of the union or two vertical or horizontal line segments , neither of which is @xmath93-equivariant .",
    "thus to prove regularity of equivariant minimizers in this setting ( proposition [ minimizing ] ) , we adapt ideas of almgren - simon @xcite to perform appropriate neckpinches on the equivariantly minimizing sequence and do a replacement procedure so that the sequence consists of disks in a small ball about the singular axis .",
    "this allows us to reduce to the case of disks where the equivariantly minimizing limits and limits minimizing among all isotopies coincide .",
    "if @xmath103 we give a second argument based on ruling out the various singularities that can occur at @xmath20 .",
    "the case @xmath70 is special because as observed earlier , the minimizing sequence may contain segments of the singular axis .",
    "+ in summary we need the following three ingredients :    1 .   @xmath3-stationary @xmath104 stationary 2 .",
    "@xmath3-stable @xmath104 stable 3 .",
    "a minimizing sequence for the equivariant plateau problem for planar domains has a regular limit .",
