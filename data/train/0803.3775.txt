    "we construct a likelihood function @xmath36 , which depends on cosmological parameters like @xmath9 and those describing the dark energy model , as well as on the nuisance parameters .",

    "* ) . if two random variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 are independent and have probability distribution functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , then variables @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are also random with probability distribution functions    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a dirac delta function .",

    "best fit values and confidence level constraints on dark energy parameters are sensitive to the assumed priors for the baryonic mass density and the hubble parameter .",

    "the alternate set of priors we use is @xmath55 @xcite and @xmath56 @xcite , one standard deviation errors .",
    "we define best fit values as pairs of values of cosmological parameters for which the likelihood function reaches its maximum . 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath57 confidence level contours are defined as sets of points in the parameter space with likelihood equal to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 of the maximum value of the likelihood respectively .",
