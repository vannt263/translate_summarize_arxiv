    "we compare our models with observations , as shown in figure  [ fig : fp_modeling](d ) .",
    "this suggests that although the models predict a significant offset in the kormendy relation , the effect is more subtle on the fp .",
    "hence , the clear difference between the _ observed _ blue- and red - cored galaxies on the fp ( figure  [ fig : fp_r ] ) seems beyond what can be modeled by a simple addition of young stars .",
    "instead , one needs to consider that blue - cored galaxies indeed have on average lower velocity dispersions than the general sample .    to further illustrate this point ,",

    "however , a significant fraction  roughly 30  per cent which might depend on data selection strategy  features blue cores ( positive color gradients ) .",
    "evidence is presented , suggesting that these blue - cored galaxies have undergone a recent episode of star formation that is centrally concentrated .",
    "most are blue also in terms of integrated @xmath32 colors and show strong central h@xmath2 absorption line strengths and/or emission ratios that are consistent with star forming populations . combining sdss and _ galex _ uv photometry",

    "they also tend to have a lower stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we investigate their environmental dependence and star formation properties .",
    "blue - cored galaxies exhibit a tendency to live in lower density environments compared to red - cored galaxies and , if found in close pairs , have a preference for a late - type companion . on the other hand , red - cored galaxies , which are relatively massive , are located on the red sequence as shown in the integrated @xmath32 color - magnitude relation , and those with emission lines reside in the liner region of a bpt diagram .",
    "based on a simple model that overlays a young stellar component over an old population , our sample gives a mass fraction in young stars below 2  per cent with age 100@xmath3800  myr in the central regions of blue - cored galaxies .",
    "furthermore , these positive color gradients in early - type galaxies are visible only for @xmath270.5  @xmath271.3 billion years after a star formation event .",
    "although this centrally located star formation episode can decrease the effective radius and increase the mean surface brightness , the fp of the ( majority of ) low mass blue - cored galaxies can not be reproduced by any amount of recent star formation on a red - cored galaxy .",
    "instead , they require a lower velocity dispersion , i.e. blue - cored and red - cored early - type galaxies are , perhaps fundamentally , different populations , mainly split with respect to stellar mass or velocity dispersion .    from the perspective of our investigation on the optical color gradients ,",
    "we conclude that star - forming early types are not simply the star - forming counterparts of the quiescent ones .",
    "while many parameters are connected to each other in degenerate manners , the most important role seems to be played by galaxy mass .",
    "star - formation _ dichotomy ( between the star - forming and quiescent early types ) is consistent with that of @xcite and also with the _ kinematic _ dichotomy previously addressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is compatible to the axis ratio distribution analysis of @xcite . on the other hand , small early types",
    "are suggested to be a product of early - type and late - type merger , in which case the cold gas from the late - type component would linger in the merger remnant and get used for residual star formation .",

    "<S> we have investigated the radial @xmath0 color gradients of early - type galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr6 in the redshift range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of massive early - type galaxies show a negative color gradient ( red - cored ) as generally expected for early - type galaxies . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> roughly 30  per cent of the galaxies in this sample show a positive color gradient ( blue - cored ) . </S>",
    "<S> these `` blue - cored '' galaxies often show strong h@xmath2 absorption line strengths and/or emission line ratios that are indicative of the presence of young stellar populations . combining the optical data with _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) ultraviolet photometry , we find that _ all _ blue - cored galaxies show uv@xmath3optical colors that can only be explained by young stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that most of the residual star formation in early - type galaxies is centrally concentrated . </S>",
    "<S> blue - cored galaxies are predominantly low velocity dispersion systems , and tend to live in lower density regions . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model shows that the observed positive color gradients ( blue - cored ) are visible only for a billion years after a star formation episode for the typical strength of recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the observed effective radius decreases and the mean surface brightness increases due to this centrally - concentrated star formation episode . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the majority of blue - cored galaxies may lie on different regions in the fundamental plane from red - cored ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> however , the position of the blue - cored galaxies on the fundamental plane can not be solely attributed to recent star formation but require substantially lower velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> our results based on the optical data are consistent with the residual star formation interpretation of yi and collaborators which was based on _ galex _ uv data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a low - level of residual star formation persists at the centers of most of low - mass early - type galaxies , whereas massive ones are mostly quiescent systems with metallicity - driven red cores . </S>"
