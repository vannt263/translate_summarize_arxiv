    "supersymmetry and its dynamical breaking in flat spacetime have been extensively investigated , for reviews , see refs . .",
    "their characters such as calculability and metastability can be unambiguously computed in a consistent and simple framework of oraifearitaigh model , when we accept the metastable vacua from the beginning .",
    "dedicated analysis on these models , including computing coleman - weinberg potential for pseudomoduli , taught us a great deal on the subtleties of the model building , especially on the lifetime of meta - stable vacuum .",
    "as an example , iss model , the phenomenologically long - lived lifetime of meta - stable vacuum is guaranteed by the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 @xmath2 which is the ratio of mass of quarks and dynamical scale . in this work we examine a similar problem in anti de - sitter spacetime ( @xmath0 ) , i.e. , susy breaking and its metastability in deformed background .",
    "this issue has been investigated in ref .",
    "based on goldstino effective action@xcite . here",
    "we concentrate directly on the model construction of susy breaking and demonstrate manifestly that meta - stable vacuum is generic without r - symmetry .    in the following part of this section",
    ", we present the basic methodology of this paper and figure out the physical significance of it .",
    "the studies of supersymmetry in @xmath0 were first carried out in , then generalized to wess - zumino model in and conformal field theory in .",
    "exhaustive studies on this subject show explicitly that conditions for preserving supersymmetry are @xmath3 and corresponding scalar potential is @xmath4 eq.([f - flatness ] ) constitute @xmath5 equations for @xmath5 complex variables and generally result in a discrete set of vacua .",
    "in addition , the transformation law for chiral multiplets in @xmath0 is listed as follows @xmath6 in order that supersymmetry algebra in @xmath0 closes on these fields , killing spinor equation for @xmath7 must be imposed @xmath8 since there is no chiral rotation for @xmath7 which can be seen from eq.([killing spinor ] ) .",
    "that means r - symmetry is explicitly broken in @xmath0 . recall that r symmetries play a crucial role for susy breaking collected into a theorem of nelson and seiberg@xcite : in order that a generic lagrangian breaks supersymmetry , the theory must possess an r symmetry . here",
    "we demonstrate manifestly that the theorem still holds in @xmath0 in terms of some well - known models .    in section @xmath9",
    ", we set up a general analysis on poloyni model and its interesting deformation .",
    "we observe that susy breaking with single chiral superfield is impossible unless @xmath10 is permitted .",
    "meta - stable susy breaking is still available when we take a special hierarchy between couplings .    in section @xmath11 , we focus our attention on the simplest oraifeartaigh model with superpotential @xmath12 we find that in the flat spacetime limit , quantum corrections generally result in local minima near the origin .",
    "interestingly , this model is identical to the deformation of poloyni model when we match the parameters appearing in the model .    in section @xmath13",
    ", we construct models with non - canonical kahler potential .",
    "we show that for a wide range of parameters , there are no supersymmetric vacua and thus spontaneously break supersymmetry .",
    "finally , we provide some general comments on iss model when it is put in @xmath0 .",
    "the considerations of susy breaking in flat spacetime are illustrated by poloyni model with linear superpotential @xmath14 an important point in implementing poloyni model for @xmath0 should be noted .",
    "we mentioned that decomposition to real and imaginary parts of chiral superfield is favored for dealing with complicated theories .",
    "@xmath15 supersymmetry is restored obviously from deformed f - flatness conditions ( [ f - flatness ] ) , @xmath16 moving to general wess - zumino model , we follow the computation procedure of poloyni model .",
    "we found that susy breaking model is highly constrained in @xmath0 , i.e. , there is only one model violating ( [ f - flatness ] ) .",
    "@xmath17 after detailed computation , we have @xmath18 generically , there are always supersymmetric vacua due to the explicitly broken r - symmetry .",
    "supersymmetry can be broken if the following constraints are satisfied @xmath19 obviously , these two equations are not compatible .",
    "susy breaking appears to be impossible for wess - zumino model .",
    "the novelty here is that once we set the coupling @xmath20 to be zero from the outset .",
    "subsequent study shows that it would induce supersymmetry breaking by adapting the choice of parameter : @xmath21 we see that in this type of superpotential , the complex scalar becomes massless @xmath22 , which is above the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xmath23@xcite .",
    "the spontaneously broken susy vacuum is thus stable in @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to generalize to two - field situation @xmath24 so far we have examined global properties of susy breaking in @xmath0 , let us start to analyze the local version of meta - stable susy breaking .",
    "the scalar potential written in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for wess - zumino model @xmath27 the solutions satisfying @xmath28 are @xmath29 there is one additional solution which is not susy vacua @xmath30 according to the multi - value function stationary point theorem , we learn that if @xmath31 is continuous at @xmath32 , and exist second - derivative , @xmath33 .",
    "denote @xmath34    1 .",
    "if @xmath35 and @xmath36 , it is minima , 2 .   if @xmath35 and @xmath37 , it is maxima .    for wess - zumino model @xmath38 additionally , we require the tunneling amplitude @xmath39 is highly suppressed .",
    "combine the three constraints ( [ constraint1])([constraint2 ] ) over the parameters of the model , we find there is actually a parameter range satisfying the above constraints @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath20 being small . upon to this point , we mentioned that meta - stable susy breaking is present .",
    "consider the behavior of poloyni model with deformed kahler potential @xmath42 this theory is not renormalizable .",
    "it should be regarded as quantum field theory with cutoff @xmath43 . at first glance ,",
    "the conditions for supersymmetric vacua become @xmath44 taking a special hierarchy suppresses the tunneling amplitude @xmath45 and redefine @xmath46 where underlying assumption is @xmath47 . substituting into ( [ f ] )",
    "simplifies the derivation of supersymmetric vacua . @xmath48",
    "expand the scalar potential to the order @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively @xmath51 differentiate eq.([simplifiedv ] ) with a and b , we get the stationary points of scalar potential near the origin @xmath52 when the hierarchy ( [ hierarchy ] ) is taken , the analysis is simplified and framed in a conventional language that meta - stable vacuum is stabilized due to the fact that it is far away from supersymmetric vacua .",
    "our main example of meta - stable supersymmetry breaking in this paper is greatly simple : oraifeartaigh model @xmath53 supersymmetry is restored as poloyni model in @xmath0 . in order to have control over our theory ,",
    "we take all parameters appearing in theory greatly larger than @xmath54 . in this scenario ,",
    "theory is still treated as flat spacetime supersymmetry , only the vacuum is deformed .",
    "therefore , quantum correction is the same as flat spacetime",
    ". we can regard it as either coleman - weinberg potential@xcite or effective kahler potential@xcite . for simplicity , we choose the second one .",
    "the general procedure is listed as follows ,    1 .",
    "find pseudomoduli in the original superpotential without considering curvature effects . here",
    "@xmath55 is pseudomoduli .",
    "2 .   fix the field value to derive the reduced superpotential .",
    "the original oraifeartaigh model is then reduced to @xmath56 3 .",
    "quantum corrections are collected into the effective kahler potential . @xmath57 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the good point of this method is that it respects the idea of non - renormalization theorem for superpotential .",
    "while the bad one is that it is only applicable for the case where susy breaking is small 4 .",
    "expand the one - loop kahler potential @xmath58 notice that @xmath59 has nothing to do with physics if we decouple dynamical gravity , so it can be ignored safely .",
    "@xmath60 works as correction to inverse kahler metric , and suppressed by loop - factor , it is also safely ignored .",
    "so the relevant effective kahler potential becomes @xmath61    eq.([effective ] ) is the same as meta - stable susy breaking case at eq.([metastable ] ) if we identify @xmath62 in the simplified description of theory , meta - stable susy breaking is induced by including the considerations of quantum corrections .",
    "working in canonical kahler potential means @xmath0 superalgebra can reduce to poincare superalgebra at the limit of @xmath63 .",
    "abandoning this requirement has very important impact on the distribution of supersymmetric vacua@xcite .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath64 following the same computational procedure , we derive a set of discrete of supersymmetric vacua @xmath65 assuming @xmath66 ruins the existence of physically supersymmetric vacua .",
    "another example is intended to the deformed oraifeartaigh model @xmath67 if the mass of fields are larger than @xmath54 , theory will break susy without requiring theory has flat spacetime limit .",
    "recently , aharony et al .",
    "have explored supersymmetric gauge theories in @xmath0 with @xmath68@xcite and @xmath69@xcite . in flat spacetime , meson and baryon are good candidates of degrees of freedom at low energy .",
    "when @xmath70 , seiberg duality@xcite guarantees the existence of weakly coupled magnetic theory at ir . in that regime , iss model has rank - condition susy breaking @xmath71 moving far away from the origin , non - perturbative effects@xcite restore supersymmetry .",
    "the dangerous pseudomoduli space is stabilized by coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "we encounter lots of questions when putting iss model in @xmath0 .",
    "the first one is that we are not sure whether or not seiberg duality holds in this background . to define the consistent model in @xmath0",
    ", boundary conditions should to be imposed . with different types of boundary conditions , coming different physics . for",
    "now , we just take a schematic method to analyze the theory and comment the possible results in the flat spacetime limit .",
    "there are lots of changes for the moduli space even in this limit .",
    "for example , the runaway for @xmath72 is regulated in @xmath0 .",
    "for iss model , the rank condition breaking mechanism does not exist , @xmath73 supersymmetry is not broken in ir .",
    "there is no need to include non - perturbative effects .",
    "the interesting point is that there is still meta - stable vacua when non - calculable quantum corrections are introduced for kahler potential as what we have done in oraifeartaigh model @xmath74 based on former experience , we can show that there will be meta - stable vacuum far away from the supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "exploring properties of susy breaking is interesting topic even though the background is not flat . in this work",
    "we show that explicitly broken r - symmetry can restore supersymmetry .",
    "we have executed the analysis in various types of models .",
    "first we examined the simplest poloyni model which does not break supersymmetry in @xmath0 . after doing concrete calculations for wess - zumino model , we find supersymmetry can not be broken unless @xmath75 .",
    "another way to break supersymmetry is meta - stable susy breaking which is achieved by an effective field theory description with cutoff @xmath43 and poloyni - type superpotential .",
    "its uv completion can be regarded as oraifeartaigh model in special flat spacetime limit .",
    "the interesting point is that some information about susy breaking for iss model in @xmath0 can also be obtained in this effective field theory description .",
    "furthermore , if we give up the canonical kahler potential requirment , susy can be broken in global vacuum easily ."
