    "the subject of high critical temperature superconductors starting from an early proposal of anderson ( anderson , 1987 ) polarizes significant forces around the hubbard model , its extensions and derivatives ( dagotto , 1994 ) . on this line ,",
    "taking the fact into account that high temperature superconductivity generally emerges in systems with a pronounced planar structure ( smith , manthiram , zhou , goodeneough and market , 1991 ) , the two - dimensional square lattice version of the hubbard model in its extended version is intensively used as a starting point for describing superconducting properties of this type of materials ( micnas , ranninger and robaszkiewicz , 1990 ) . as a consequence , within the last few years the hubbard hamiltonian containing nearest neighbour ( _ nn _ ) interaction and hopping terms , has been extensively studied ( de boer , de chatel , franse and de visser , 1995 ) and the emergence of superconductivity has been rigorously demonstrated in some conditions ( de boer , korepin and schadschneider , 1995 ) in these systems . in the last period , however , a great number of results directed our attention to the importance of extending the interaction and hopping range in such type of an analysis .",
    "the stimulating observations can be summarized as follows .",
    "concerning the kinetic energy term , koma and tasaki starting from the approximation - free study of two - point correlation functions at finite temperatures in low dimensional extended hubbard models containing more than _ nn _ hopping terms ( koma and tasaki , 1992 ) sharply demonstrated the fact that electron hopping with higher than _ nn _ terms plays a fundamental role in various condensation phenomena in itinerant - electron systems .",
    "the importance of hopping - range in building up the phase diagram was also emphasized in an exact manner for finite- ( tasaki , 1995 ) and infinite-_u _ ( verges , guinea , galan , van dongen , chiappe and louis , 1994 ) hubbard models .",
    "furthermore , as it was pointed out by veilleux _",
    "( veilleux , dar , chen , vilk and tremblay , 1995 ) within a model containing only _ nn _ hopping the fermi surface topology and the filling dependence of both the hall coefficient and the uniform magnetic susceptibility are qualitatively wrong , a disagreement that can not be removed perturbatively . on the other hand ,",
    "incorporating also next - nearest neighbour ( _ nnn _ ) hopping the band structure becomes more realistic and all the above mentioned physical quantities , as well as the position of neutron scattering intensity maxima , have the correct qualitative behaviour ( lavagna and stemmann , 1994 , littlewood , zaanen , aeppli and monien , 1994 ) .",
    "following this line of reasoning it is important to mention that the relative influence of density of state ( dos ) effects - like van hove singularities ( blumberg , stojkovic and klein , 1995 ) - and fermi surface topology effects - like nesting ( gulcsi , bishop and gulcsi , 1995 ) - on pairing are extremely important in describing superconducting properties of high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "while both van hove singularity and nesting occur simultaneously at half filling in the usual _ nn _ model , there is no nesting when _ nnn _ hopping is present ( veilleux _ et al . _ and",
    "references cited therein ) and the influence of saddle point effects ( abrikosov , 1995 , abrikosov , 1994 ) can be taken more accurately into consideration .",
    "furthermore , the presence of hopping exceeding _ nn",
    "_ terms in range was observed , in particular , by thermopower measurements in related systems ( ponnambalam and varadaraju , 1995 ) and was found to be consistent with angle - resolved photoemission data ( fehrenbacher and norman , 1995 ) and gap symmetry analysis ( odonovan and carbotte , 1995 ) too .",
    "we also would like to mention that the ratio of _ nn _ to _ nnn _ hopping amplitudes is clearly known for a broad spectrum of high-@xmath0 materials ( brenig , 1995 ) .",
    "concerning the interaction terms , it is known from exact studies of phase diagrams related to extended hubbard models in higher than one dimension ( strack and vollhardt , 1994 ) that contributions exceeding _ nn _ distances in range can significantly influence the emergence of condensed phases . up to this moment such type of studies have been carried out on magnetic phases , however , the relevance of the obtained results to superconductivity is quite straightforward ( strack and vollhardt , 1995 ) .",
    "similarly , the non - negligible character of _ nnn _ interaction contributions was clearly pointed out experimentally .",
    "for example , the importance of _ nnn _ type off - site interactions was revealed in the interpretation of auger core - valence line shapes ( verdozzi and cini , 1995 ) , which allows the direct observation and measurement of interparticle interaction strength and its distance dependence in valence bands of solids ( verdozzi , 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , king _ et al .",
    "_ based on angle resolved photoemission data ( king _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) , clearly underline that model hamiltonians containing interaction terms only up to the _ nn _ ones are not sufficient for the proper description of the electronic structure near the fermi energy ( @xmath3 ) in _ ncco _ type materials .",
    "they also conlude that _ nnn _ interactions are _ very _ important and models including only _ nn _ interactions in @xmath4 planes are unable to explain related clear experimental facts .",
    "the interpretation of two - magnon raman scattering in high-@xmath0 materials ( specially the @xmath5 and @xmath6 finite intensity peaks ) also requires second - nearest neighbour or even longer - range contributions to be incorporated at the level of the interaction terms ( brenig ) .",
    "moreover , the importance of _ nnn _ terms in developing basic properties of extended hubbard models has been claimed ( di stasio and zotos , 1995 ) , their effect on screening processes and as well as on phase diagram configurations has been studied ( van den brink , meinders , lorenzana , eder and sawatzky , 1995 ) , the relevance to _ ybco _ materials has been emphasized for various conditions ( grigelionis , tornau and rosengren , 1996 ) and their importance in loss of antiferromagnetic order has been discussed ( kampf , 1994 ) .    stimulated by these findings we present an extensive study of superconducting phase diagram of the extended hubbard model containing more than nearest neighbour contributions , in order to provide a systematic image about the importance of the longer range contributions .",
    "the study is given in two dimensions , based on a traditional hartree - fock type decoupling procedure in terms of the green s function description allowing , however , arbitrary gap symmetry .",
    "the dos is treated exactly , and the stable superconducting state is chosen on the basis of a free - energy type analysis . such type of a _ systematic _ investigation , incorporating the effects of _ nnn _ terms too , has not been presented so far in literature .",
    "our results emphasize the importance of interaction and hopping terms _ exceeding _",
    "nearest neighbouring distance in range in building up superconducting characteristics of the system described by an extended hubbard type model . in particular , the emergence of superconducting phases of different symmetry at a given point of the phase diagram , critical temperatures , zero temperature gap amplitude values , @xmath7 ratios , doping and temperature dependences are strongly influenced by the presence of _ nnn _ terms .",
    "based on the results we conclude that the effect of _ nnn _ terms is not marginal but essential in the description of basic superconducting properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "this is a first - order transition between two superconducting phases of different symmetry close to the phase boundary lines . a similar double transition between _ s _ - and @xmath76-wave states has been deduced by dahm",

    "furthermore , at a fixed value of the doping , for strong repulsive on - site interactions and not excessively low @xmath86 values , the @xmath87-symmetry phase represents not only a possible solution but it is the most stable superconducting phase among all the solutions of the gap equation .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviour has been conjectured in various circumstances ( mierzejewski and zielinski , 1995 , gufan , vereshkov , toledano , mettout , bouzerar and lorman , 1995 ) . concerning the spin and charge density wave states not taken explicitly into account in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we expect their influence to be minor in the non - paramagnetic domain of the phase diagram . in this respect",
    "we would like to note that the nesting condition is hindered by doping in general , so its effect is reduced at low temperatures ( inaba , matsukawa , saitoh and fukuyama , 1996 ) and following this line , doping usually enhances the emergence of superconductivity ( scalapino , 1995 , iglesias , bernhard and gusmao , 1995 ) .      from this paragraph on , besides _ nn _ terms , _ nnn _ contributions are also incorporated in the model hamiltonian . as a first step , in order to obtain a clear image about modifications arising in the phase diagrams _ purely _ due to the presence of hopping terms exceeding _ nn _ distance in range , all the previously used interaction terms are kept unchanged but a more complex kinetic energy contribution is introduced in the present paragraph .",
    "this step also enables us to get an overall picture on how properties related to superconductivity are modified by dos effects due to long - range hopping , without mixing these effects with the effects of _ nnn _ two - particle interaction terms . to accentuate the relevance to high-@xmath88 materials",

    "_ related to the stability of the @xmath110 state .",
    "concerning triplet pairing we note that the states with @xmath121- , @xmath113- and @xmath114-symmetry never have lower free - energy in the coupling constants space under study than the triplet pairing state of standard @xmath80-wave symmetry .",
    "if now the @xmath122 case is considered , the phase diagram significantly changes , as it is shown in fig .",
    "the most important feature of this figure is , that the @xmath43-symmetry solution never reaches the level of a stable superconducting state within the analyzed @xmath24 region for @xmath123 for slight dopings .",
    "this result is in accordance with the observation of fehrenbacher _ et al .",
    "_ , where it is claimed that in the presence of on - site repulsion with small _ nnn _ attractions ( @xmath124 ) , the stable superconducting state of @xmath43-symmetry can be realized in the limit of @xmath125 only at relatively high values of the doping .",
    "figure  [ fig6](a ) and ( c ) show the @xmath48 phase diagram of the model with @xmath126 at two doping values ( @xmath69 and @xmath119 ) in the @xmath127 plane .",
    "the phase boundary between the @xmath76 and @xmath110 phases moves slowly into the domain of @xmath76 phase with increasing values of the doping , that is , higher doping favors states of @xmath110-symmetry over states of @xmath76-symmetry .",
    "furthermore , as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( c ) , the @xmath87-@xmath110 phase boundary is linear and strongly affected by doping . for small values of @xmath81",
    "it coincides with the @xmath128 line with @xmath129 , while for larger doping values it is shifted away and @xmath130 becomes smaller than @xmath131 .",
    "this leads to the following interesting feature : changing the doping continuously the symmetry of the stable superconducting state changes and a transition between the two different _",
    "d_-like pairing states ( from @xmath42-symmetry to @xmath41-symmetry ) takes place for small , fixed values of the coupling constants .",
    "this transition line within the @xmath75 phase diagram , suggested by detailed investigations , is of first order .",
    "examining phase boundaries between the @xmath80 and @xmath110 or @xmath76 superconducting states , one can see them moving upward with increasing doping into the @xmath76-symmetry phase .",
    "however , large _",
    "interaction ( @xmath132 ) and small _ nn _ attraction ( @xmath133 ) favors superconducting pairing state of @xmath76 or @xmath110 symmetry , depending on the sign of @xmath24 , an observation that holds even for heavily doped systems .",
    "turning now to the @xmath82 case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) and ( d ) , it can be observed that the triple - point moves downward in the @xmath134 region with increasing the temperature .",
    "the phase boundary of the @xmath87 phase modifies more rapidly with increasing _",

    "the stability of the @xmath110 phase against thermal fluctuations , in comparison with the same stability of @xmath76 phase , is again striking .    in the light of figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , one can conclude that small @xmath138 and large attractive _ nnn _ coupling @xmath24 favors @xmath110 pairing , while small @xmath120 and strong attractive _ nn _ coupling @xmath23 gives rise to stable @xmath76 pairing .",
    "these results emphasize the correctness of the conjecture made by wenger and stlund ( wenger _ et al . _ ) related to the stability of different _ d _ symmetry species , who also claimed that third - neighbour attractive interaction could lead to a stable * k*-dependent _ s_-wave within the phase diagram , especially in the presence of repulsive closer - neighbour interactions .",
    "the electron doping versus hole doping behaviour is examplified with fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where doping dependence of gap amplitudes and free - energy are shown for a certain set of coupling constants . having a glance at fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) one can see that besides the gap amplitudes , phase also changes ( i.e. sign change of @xmath51 in the presented figure ) emerge for different solutions at a critical value of doping .",
    "more interestingly , fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) predicts the stable superconducting state to have @xmath43-symmetry in the electron doped regime even for repulsive on - site couplings .",
    "this suggests that the symmetry of the pairing state in electron doped materials ( for example in _ ncco _ ) might be explained without assuming attracion in the on - site interaction channel .",
    "systematic study of the electron doped case is under progress .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we focus our attention on the effects accentuately caused by _",
    "interaction terms in @xmath0 , in zero temperature gap - amplitude and in the ratio of @xmath98 . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath23 is set to be zero in this study .",
    "this particular choice results in an order parameter of the form @xmath139 , ( i.e. only _ s _ and @xmath111 components ) .",
    "the values of @xmath22 and @xmath24 are tuned so that the emerging @xmath43-symmetry pairing state becomes the stable superconducting state for the chosen set of interaction parameters .",
    "the effect of @xmath24 on the mentioned quantities is presented in the figure .",
    "we note , that for @xmath140 values a similar analysis can be done leading essentially to the same features .",
    "first of all , fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) shows the @xmath24 dependence of the gap amplitudes at zero temperatures .",
    "one can immediately realize the exponential type behaviour of @xmath141 versus @xmath142 for small , @xmath143 values . at the same time",
    ", @xmath144 has a linear dependence on @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath24 dependence of the critical temperature is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) for the @xmath43-symmetry solution . a good fit to the numerically calculated points can be obtained by the @xmath145}$ ] relation , where @xmath146 .",
    "such type of @xmath0 behaviour related to non - on - site interactions is not unusual .",

    "[ fig8](c ) the @xmath148 values are plotted versus @xmath149 for the two components of the @xmath43 solution . in the @xmath150 case ( where the order parameter has the form of @xmath151 ) this ratio is about @xmath152 and hence corresponds to the _ bcs _ predicted value",
    "however , if _ nnn",
    "_ interaction is turned on an @xmath111 component of the order parameter develops rapidly resulting in an increase ( decrease ) of the ratio _",
    "r _ for the @xmath111 ( _ s _ ) channel .    based on these results",
    "it can be seen that nonzero next - nearest neighbour coupling , besides the emergence of different possible superconducting species , also influences the main characteristic properties of the superconducting phase .",
    "the superconducting phase diagram of the two - dimensional extended hubbard model containing hopping and interaction terms with spatial dependences exceeding nearest neighbour distance in range has been systematically analyzed in mean - field approximation .",
    "the possible superconducting phases of different symmetry were taken into account unrestrictedly . for building up the phase diagrams ,",
    "the emerging phase was choosen on the basis of a free - energy ( or at @xmath75 ground state energy ) analysis of all the possible solutions of the gap equations for every fixed set of coupling constants , temperature and doping values .",
    "main characteristics of different superconducting phases including critical temperatures @xmath88 , zero temperature gap amplitudes @xmath1 , @xmath153 ratios , temperature and doping dependences were also studied in detail for every domain of the phase diagram .",
    "the obtained results clearly underline the importance of next nearest neighbour terms ( both hopping and interaction contributions ) in determining the prominent superconducting properties of the system .",
    "the present paper explored such a parameter domain of the phase diagram which has not been investigated so far systematically in literature starting with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where in the presence of only nearest neighbour terms , non half - filled band case was also investigated .",
    "starting from this level different next - nearest neighbour contributions were taken gradually into consideration within the extended hubbard hamiltonian , their effects being systematically presented in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig8 ] and analyzed in detail with physical implications being emphasized , especially those connected to the presence of next - nearest neighbour terms .    on this line",
    "the following interesting features deserve attention : double phase transitions with decreasing temperature ( following the emergence of a superconducting state at @xmath154 the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter changes at @xmath155 in a first - order phase transition ) ; quantum phase transitions at zero temperature between pairing states of different symmetry driven by doping ; enhancement in the resistance of the stable superconducting phase against thermal pair - breaking effects in the presence of interaction terms exceeding nearest neighbour distance in range ; increase in the @xmath75 gap - amplitude over @xmath88 ratio for some symmetry species ; the main superconducting properties become more sensible with respect to doping ; strong asymmetry between hole and electron doped cases ; rich spectrum of stable superconducting states of different symmetry ( in the presence of repulsive on - site and in some cases even for repulsive nearest neighbour interactions , the @xmath43 symmetry is favored for electron , and a @xmath156-wave type order parameter for hole doping values ) ; elimination of * k*-independent order parameters even at half - filling , and so on .",
    "we strongly hope , that the presented results will constitute a valuable starting point for further theoretical investigations related to the effect of long - range contributions in building up superconducting properties of the system under study .",
