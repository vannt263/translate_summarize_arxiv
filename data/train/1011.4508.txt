    "barred galaxies often reveal a striking difference in star formation activity between the bar and outer spiral arms(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) . most star forming regions ( h@xmath1 emission ) are associated with the outer spiral arms rather than with the bar , even when both host a similar amount of molecular gas .",
    "the difference is often attributed to strong shear motions along the bar , by which giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) could be pulled apart and disrupted before the ignition of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand , according to @xcite , the observed velocity gradient in a bar is not large enough to shred gravitationally - bound gmcs .",
    "unfortunately , previous studies suffered from large uncertainties in measurement of gas surface density , due to the poor image quality ( fidelity ) of interferometer observations , or to low sensitivity and resolution even when the observations from a single dish telescope are included .",
    "interferometers have the intrinsic missing flux problem , and can not measure the gas surface density accurately .",
    "most interferometric studies covered only a central bar region including the nucleus , and did not extend to outer spiral arms , because of the limited field - of - view .",
    "they studies concentrated on nuclear gas condensations and the gas fueling galactic centers(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , and did not contrast the difference between the bar and outer spiral arms . at low resolution ,",
    "the velocity gradients and gas surface densities appear similar in the inner bar and outer spiral arms , perhaps because of beam dilution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we quantitatively study the star formation rate ( sfr ) and efficiency ( sfe = sfr/@xmath4 ; the ratio of the sfr to the molecular gas mass ) at a high resolution over the disk of the barred galaxy ngc 4303 , using new molecular gas data at high quality .",
    "we capitalize on the recent development of the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) interferometer , and the 25 beam receiver ( bears : @xcite ) and on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping technique ( @xcite ) at the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope ( nro45 ) .",
    "the combination of carma and nro45 solves the missing flux problem , providing the best image fidelity and quality , and enabling accurate measurement of gas surface density .",
    "our measurement is based on the fundamental transition @xmath5 of co , which has often been used to derive the gas surface density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we occasionally refer to `` molecular gas '' as `` gas '' for simplicity in the rest of the paper .",
    "we also investigate the star formation activity in the context of the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) law ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ks law is the observational correlation between the area averaged sfr ( @xmath6 [ @xmath7 yr@xmath8 kpc@xmath9 ) and gas surface density ( @xmath10 [ @xmath7 pc@xmath9 ) as a power law : @xmath11 .",
    "this correlation of @xcite spans a wide range , 5 orders of magnitude in @xmath10 and 7 in @xmath6 , with @xmath12 = 1.4 @xmath13 0.15 using a sample of 61 nearby spiral and 36 starburst galaxies .",
    "most recent studies concentrate on the ks law at high spatial resolutions , and use local gas and star formation rate densities rather than the averages over galactic disks .",
    "the power law index is a topic of interest , since it could indicate the physical origin of the correlation .",
    "a linear correlation , @xmath14 , would indicate that the star formation efficiency is a constant over a large range of gas surface density ; in other words , the mere presence of the gas is sufficient for star formation . on the other hand , a super - linear correlation , @xmath15",
    ", may suggest that additional conditions or trigger mechanisms , such as gas dynamics , also play critical roles .",
    "@xcite averaged their data azimuthally as a function of galactic radius for 7 gas rich galaxies , and obtained @xmath16 and 1.7 ( for two different extinction models ) .",
    "@xcite used the locally averaged parameters ( 520 pc aperture ) around h@xmath1 and 24 @xmath17 m peaks in m 51 , and obtained @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite studied the ks law for 18 nearby galaxies at 750 pc resolution and derived @xmath19 .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the ks law breaks down at a smaller scale ( 180 pc ) .",
    "this may indicate that the mechanism for triggering star formation operates at a scale smaller than 500 pc , and that star formation is triggered by the environment of gmcs at a scale @xmath20 500 pc .",
    "we study the relation between the gas and star formation at a scale of @xmath3 250 pc .",

    "it is a member of the virgo cluster ( d = 16.1 mpc ; @xcite ) , whose bar and spiral arms are resolved spatially and kinematically with carma ( table [ table:4303 ] ) .",
    "even a glance at an h@xmath1 image is enough to recognize the striking difference in star formation activity between the bar and spiral arms in this galaxy ( see @xcite figure 5 ) .",
    "the co emission from has been observed with various radio telescopes , i.e. , the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro : @xcite ) , nobeyama millimeter array ( nma : @xcite ) , berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima : @xcite ) , and the nro45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we observe with nro45 and carma and combine the data to obtain a high fidelity image .",

    "we observed the @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) line emission ( @xmath22 = 115.2712 ghz ) toward the barred spiral galaxy ngc 4303 with nro45 and carma .",
    "the combination of nro45 and carma interferometer data provides an unprecedented level of image fidelity at a high resolution .",
    "interferometers have an intrinsic limitation : they can not obtain the shortest spacing components in @xmath23 plane , and thus are not sensitive to the most extended structures .",

    "this area covers the optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "we alternated between continuous scans in ra and dec , as systematic noise appears dominantly along the direction perpendicular to the scan , which causes it to cancel out when the scans are combined .",
    "the 25 beams draw a regular 5@xmath31 stripe in a single scan , which is finer than the nyquist spacing of the 15@xmath31 nro45 beam  no spatial information is missed , which is critical in producing good @xmath23 coverage and in combining with carma data .",
    "we construct data cubes only for the 5@xmath32 @xmath24 5@xmath32 area covered by all 25 beams ( figure [ fig : observation ] ) .",

    "we produced separate data cubes for the scans taken in the ra and dec directions and combine them using the basket - weave method in _ nostar_. lower weights were applied to the data at small wave - numbers in the scan directions in the fourier domain , which significantly reduces the systematic noise in the combined map .",

    "we adopted a 19 point hexagonal mosaic pattern with 30@xmath31 spacing ( i.e. , the nyquist spacing of a 10.4-m primary beam ; figure [ fig : observation ] ) .",

    "the pointing offset vector between the radio and optical pointings was measured at the beginning of the observations .",
    "we used the data reduction package _ miriad _ ( @xcite ) for calibration and data analysis .",

    "the combined image achieved higher angular resolution than the nro45 map and recovered the flux missing in the carma map .    by utilizing _ miriad _ and new routines that we developed , we combined nro45 and carma data in the following way : +    1 .",
    "deconvolution of single dish map with single - dish beam + the point spread function ( psf ) of the nro45 map is a convolution of the nro45 beam pattern and the spheroidal function that we applied to regrid the data points and create the final data cube .",

    "a comparison of the total flux in the nro45 , carma , and combined images clearly shows that the missing flux has been completely recovered ( table [ table : comparison ] ) .",
    "we obtained archival h@xmath1 ( @xcite ) and k - band @xcite images from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) and a 24 @xmath17 m image ( p.i .",

    "the co emission is concentrated in the central 40@xmath31 ( @xmath3 3.2 kpc ) , which includes the offset ridges and circumnuclear disk . in particular",
    ", the circumnuclear disk shows a circular structure ( @xmath38 = 4@xmath264 @xmath3 350 pc ) , extending from 1541.3 km s@xmath8 southeast of the nucleus to 1611.5 km s@xmath8 to the northwest in the velocity channel maps ( figure [ fig : ch_comb1 ] , figure [ fig : ch_comb2 ] ) .",

    "the carma mosaic covered the circular area with a radius of @xmath50 .",

    "both co and h@xmath1 emission appear clearly along stellar spiral arms , and the h@xmath1 arms are offset toward the leading side of the co arms .",
    "similar offsets are evident between co and 24 @xmath17 m emission .",
    "the 24 @xmath17 m emission is at the leading side of the co emission .",
    "these offsets are due to the delay of star formation from the accumulation of gas in the spiral arms ( @xcite ) ; approximately , an offset would be @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the angular speed of the gas and pattern speed of spiral arms , respectively , and @xmath57 is the timescale of star formation . the sites of star formation are resolved in our observations .",
    "the analysis of local star formation rate and efficiency should take this into account , since the parental gas and star forming regions would not be correlated at the high spatial resolution .",
    "this means that the ks law breaks down at this resolution .",
    "we need to smooth the data before characterizing the spatial variation of the star formation efficiency in  4.2 .",
    "figure [ fig : off ] ( a ) , ( b ) show a close - up of the offset between co ( black contours ) and h@xmath1 emissions ( greyscale ) . in the upper panels , the arrows indicate the direction of gas flow , assuming pure azimuthal rotation and a time lag between star formation and gas accumulation in spiral arms .",
    "figure [ fig : off ] ( c ) shows the phase diagrams of co ( contours ) and h@xmath1 ( greyscale ) .",
    "again , the h@xmath1 emission is found predominantly at the leading side of the co spiral arms over the entire range of radii ( over 40@xmath31 , @xmath3 3.1 kpc ) .    the offsets between the co and h@xmath1 arms range from 0 to 1 kpc , with an average of @xmath58 pc at radius , @xmath38 @xmath59 40@xmath31 ( @xmath3 3.1 kpc ; i.e. , the area we define as outer spiral arms in  4.4 ) .",
    "thus , we will smooth the data to the spatial resolution of @xmath3 500 pc for later discussions ; it also especially affects the analysis of sfe .",
    "we will discuss this further in @xmath21 4.4 .",
    "@xcite introduced a new method to estimate the timescale of star formation using these offsets , measuring the offset / time lag between gas accumulation and star formation .",
    "@xcite applied this method to and 24 @xmath17 m data .",
    "their offsets @xmath20 250 pc ( calculated from their paper ) , are translated to the timescale of @xmath3 1 myr . on the other hand , @xcite used co and h@xmath1 data for ngc 4303 , and derived the offsets of 7001000 pc and the timescale of @xmath3 10 myr , an order of magnitude longer than the @xcite results .",
    "our offsets are closer to those in @xcite . to understand this discrepancy , we compared 24 @xmath17 m and h@xmath1 images , and found no significant offsets between the two .",
    "thus , h@xmath1 traces the locations of star forming regions as well as 24 @xmath17 m .",
    "the discrepancy may come from the difference of co and .",
    "if the emission traces the gas dissociated by star formation , and not the natal gas for star formation , it explains the small offsets between and 24 @xmath17 m emissions .",
    "our simple analysis with co and h@xmath1/24 @xmath17 m favors the longer star formation timescale of @xcite in case of ngc 4303 .",
    "these results should be confirmed with a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "we compare the star formation rate ( sfr ) and star formation efficiency ( sfe ) between the bar and outer spiral arms , as well as within other components ( i.e. , circumnuclear disk , inter - arm regions ) , at the spatial resolution of @xmath58 pc .",
    "the sfe is the ratio of the sfr to the gas mass within an aperture , namely @xmath60 = \\frac{\\text{sfr } [ \\text{m}_{\\sun } \\text{yr$^{-1}$}]}{m_{\\text{h}_2 } [ \\text{m}_{\\sun } ] } , \\label{eq : sfe}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the molecular hydrogen gas mass .",
    "we calculate the sfr and gas mass within an aperture and use the averaged parameters to derive the sfe .",
    "we smooth our co and h@xmath1 images to the same resolution as the 24 @xmath17 m image ( 6@xmath31 resolution ) in order to correlate the parental gas and star forming regions .",
    "this resolution corresponds to a linear size of @xmath3 500 pc , similar to the linear resolution at which @xcite find the correlation between gas surface density and associated star formation rate .",
    "a sfr map is shown in figure [ fig : sfr_sfe ] ( a ) .",
    "high sfrs are apparent in intense star forming regions which are sparsely distributed along the spiral arms , as well as in the circumnuclear disk .",
    "however , sfrs are lower in the bar , even though the gas surface densities along the bar offset ridges are as high as those in the spiral arms .",
    "the low sfr in the bar has been suggested qualitatively by previous studies ( most systematically by @xcite ) , and we discuss this quantitatively in the following sections .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr_sfe ] ( b ) shows a map of the sfe .",
    "low sfes are seen in the bar ( especially around the offset ridges ) and in the inter - arm regions . exceptionally high sfes appear at the leading side of the co arms .",
    "this indicates that the offsets between h@xmath1 and co emission are not fully smoothed out even at the resolution of @xmath58 pc ( see @xmath21 3.2 ) , even though the parental gas shows a fair correlation with sfr @xcite .",
    "we first compare the gas surface density ( @xmath10 ) , area averaged sfr ( @xmath6 ) , and sfe between the bar and spiral arms on the basis of azimuthal averages ( figure [ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "the average values are derived in 1 kpc ( 12@xmath268 ) width annuli , which is enough to average out the spatial offsets ( see @xmath21 3.2 ) .",

    "figure [ fig : point ] ( a ) shows the definitions of nucleus , bar , and outer spiral arms .",
    "the nucleus might include a portion of the bar region ; however , we are mainly interested in the differences between the bar and spiral arms , so it does not affect our analysis .",

    "the definitions of the nucleus , bar , and spiral arms are indicated with arrows in figure [ fig : radial ] ( a ) .",
    "sfe drops abruptly from the circumnuclear disk to the bar , and increases toward the spiral arms ( figure [ fig : radial ] ( c ) ) .",
    "quantitatively , the average sfe is about twice as high in the spiral arms as in the bar .      the star formation efficiency ( sfe , eq .",
    "[ eq : sfe ] ) is a correlation between star forming regions and their parental gas .",
    "we have resolved the scale where the star forming regions and gas are spatially separated ; therefore , we have to smooth the data to derive a sfe with physical importance .",
    "@xcite found a good correlation between the surface densities of sfr and gas mass at the 500 pc scale .",
    "this is similar to the typical separation of h@xmath1 and co emission that we see in ngc 4303 (  [ sec : resolvedsf ] ) .",
    "we smooth h@xmath1 and our co images to the scale of the spitzer 24 @xmath17 m image ( @xmath63 ; @xmath58 pc ) , and compare local sfr and sfe between the bar and spiral arms at this scale .",
    "four regions ( i.e. , bar , spiral arms , inter - arms regions , and circumnuclear region ) are defined as in figure [ fig : point ] ( b ) .",
    "the circumnuclear region is a 6@xmath31 diameter circle ( @xmath58 pc ) , based on a near - infrared ( nir ) image of prez - ramrez et al .",
    "we define the bar as an ellipse with the deprojected major and minor axis diameters of 40@xmath31 @xmath24 26@xmath31 ( 3.1 @xmath24 2.0 kpc ) , based on a k - band image .",
    "this definition yields an ellipticity similar to the one derived by @xcite based on a near infrared @xmath64-band image , and a major axis diameter consistent with the determination of @xcite .",
    "the spiral arms and inter - arm regions are separated by eye using the k - band image .",
    "figure [ fig : point ] ( b ) shows our definitions overlaid on the @xmath65-band image .",
    "figure [ fig : hist ] shows the histograms of @xmath10 ( left ) , @xmath6 ( center ) , and sfe ( right ) for the spiral arms and bar ( top and bottom ) .",
    "high gas surface density regions are present only in the bar , but not in the spiral arms",
    ". however , high sfr and sfe regions appear only in the spiral arms and are absent in the bar . therefore , high sfr and sfe are evident in the spiral arms in the local average , as well as in the azimuthal average .",
    "we calculate the excesses of sfr and sfe in each region with respect to the averages over the entire disk excluding the nucleus ( table 4 ) .",
    "the sfr and sfe in the bar are 10 @xmath66 and 30 @xmath66 smaller than the disk averages , respectively .",
    "star formation activity in the bar is low compared to the entire disk . on the contrary , the sfr and sfe in the spiral arms are about 10 @xmath66 and 40 @xmath66 higher than those over the disk , respectively .",
    "active star formation preferentially occurs in the spiral arms .",
    "sfr and sfe are about 30 @xmath66 and twice as high in the spiral arms as in the bar .",
    "the results confirm quantitatively the notion that star formation in bar is less than in spiral arms .",
    "the effect of the spatial offsets between h@xmath1 and co emissions is significantly reduced by the smoothing to estimate local sfe ( @xmath3 500 pc resolution )",
    ". however , it still shows some residual effects in sfes , since the average of this offset is also @xmath3 500 pc .",
    "if the offset is below 500 pc , parent gmcs and star forming regions exist within our resolution for sfe discussions .",
    "if the offset is above 500 pc , we can not recognize both parent gmcs and star forming regions within the resolution .",
    "sfes obtained in such a region will not fairly represent the local sfe .",
    "this produces sfes above 10@xmath67 yr@xmath8 are the artifacts ( figure [ fig : sfr_sfe ] ) .",
    "the sfr and sfe are the highest in the nuclear region .",
    "the azimuthal averages of @xmath68 and sfe ( figure [ fig : radial ] ( a ) , ( c ) ) clearly show this tendency , being about 5 times and twice higher than the disk averages , respectively .",
    "the locally averaged sfe in the nucleus is also high .",
    "the locally averaged sfr and sfe are higher by a factor of 6.9 , and 1.3 , respectively than those of the entire disk region .",
    "we , however , note that ngc 4303 is suggested to harbor an agn in addition to a starburst ( e.g. @xcite ) , and our analysis could suffer from agn contamination .",
    "we checked the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the nucleus in 124 @xmath17 m , using the archival data ( _ catalog of infrared observations _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "we found a flat spectrum from 1024 @xmath17 m , similar to agn spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , 24 @xmath17 m emission from the nucleus is dominated by the agn .",
    "this indicates that the much higher values of sfr in the nucleus are overestimated .",
    "we adopt the standard conversion factor @xmath43 . however , there are some arguments supporting a metallicity - dependent @xmath43 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "has a relatively large radial metallicity gradient ( @xcite ) , which may affect the result that sfe is low in the bar ( inner disk ) and high in spiral arms ( outer disk ) .",
    "we confirmed as follows that this does not change the results ( except for the nucleus , where metallicity is exceptionally high ) .",
    "the average metallicities ( 12 + @xmath69[o / h ] ) in the nucleus , bar , and spiral arms ( the definition is same as figure [ fig : point ] ( b ) ) are 9.5 , 9.3 , and 9.2 from @xcite . if we adopt the @xmath43-metallicity relation of @xcite , the gas surface densities decrease , and the average sfes increase ( by a factor of 4.2 , 2.3 , and 1.8 ) respectively . the difference in sfe between the bar and spiral arms is reduced only by 30 @xmath66 .",
    "this is too small to change the trend that the sfe is roughly a factor of two higher in spiral arms than in bar .",
    "a significant effect appears only in the nucleus , where a much higher metallicity results in a significantly higher sfe ( a factor of 2  4 higher than that from the standard @xmath43 ) .",
    "the kennicut - schmidt ( ks ) law shows a tight correlation between the gas surface density @xmath70 and sfr density @xmath6 @xcite as we mentioned in @xmath21 1 .",
    "the difference in sfe between the bar and spiral arms may affect this correlation .",
    "figure [ fig : ks ] ( a ) shows the surface densities of gas ( @xmath71 [ m@xmath72 pc@xmath9 ) and area averaged star formation rate ( @xmath6 [ m@xmath72 yr@xmath8 pc@xmath9 ) for our data at @xmath3 500 pc resolution .",
    "we use the same axis ranges as those in figure 9 of @xcite , spanning five orders of magnitude in @xmath71 and seven orders of magnitude in @xmath68 , a range which covers from normal spiral galaxies to circumstellar starburst .",
    "the central region of our data could be contaminated with agn , and the sfr calculated form 24 @xmath17 m could be overestimated.therefore , we fit straight lines to two sets of data , i.e. , with and without the central region , to see the effect of agn on the ks fits .",
    "figure [ fig : ks ] ( a ) shows our least square fit results : the orange and blue solid lines are for the data with and without the central region , and are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the contamination of agn apparently increases the index @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis of @xcite might have been contaminated with agns , which are typically found in galaxies with circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "figure [ fig : ks ] ( a ) compares our result with those from previous studies .",
    "the solid black line is the result of @xcite ; @xmath12 = 1.4 @xmath13 0.15 .",
    "they calculated gas surface densities with co data ( gas density ) , and and co data ( total gas density ) .",
    "the grey region indicates the scatter in kennicutt ( 1998 , their @xmath75 9 ) .",
    "dashed lines are the fit in @xcite ; the large and small dashes are the fits for and co ( @xmath12 = 1.56 @xmath13 0.04 ) , and for co - only ( @xmath12 = 1.37 @xmath13 0.03 ) , respectively .",
    "the dotted line is from @xcite , and is for @xmath12 = 0.96 @xmath13 0.07 .",
    "our result , @xmath12 = 0.67 , is closer to @xcite , than to @xcite , though it s smaller than the linear correlation @xmath12 = 1 .",
    "our data lie roughly in the range of kennicutt ( 1998 , grey region ) , although some data points deviate from the exact range .",
    "the deviations occur on the spiral arms , where the offsets between the gas and star forming regions are large (  4.4 ) . at the 500 pc resolution ,",
    "the ks law is present , but suffers slightly from the offset effect .",
    "two types of scatter appear in figure [ fig : ks ] ( a ) , ( b ) .",
    "one is the scatter of ngc 4303 itself , i.e. , its deviation from the average of galaxies , and the other is within the disk of ngc 4303 .",
    "the distribution of our points is concentrated in a small region , and the scatter within the galaxy is smaller than that of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scatter among galaxies seems dominant .",
    "overall , ngc 4303 fits on the plot of @xcite , but has slightly higher sfe than the average .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath6 show one order of magnitude scatters in figure [ fig : ks ] ( b ) , which is consistent with the results of bigiel et al .",
    "( 2008 , their @xmath75 4 ) .",
    "therefore , an order of magnitude scatter of star formation activity is common at a sub - kpc scale .",
    "@xcite showed that sfe varies strongly with local conditions .",
    "since the ks law breaks down at the scale of a few 100 pc , we could attribute the variation of sfe to local environments at the scale of a few 100 pc .",
    "one of the key environmental factors might be galactic dynamics ( e.g. spiral arms ) .",
    "we verify a scatter of ngc 4303 itself among nearby galaxies , i.e. a scatter from the ks law . rough estimation of scatter shows that our results are a factor of @xmath3 5 higher than the that of @xcite .",
    "however , the ks plot has a @xmath13 1 order of magnitude scatter , as we discussed in  5.1 .",
    "even though our data are the fit by @xcite , they are still within the scatter ( grey region ) .",
    "we observed the barred spiral galaxy in the @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) line with nro45 and carma .",
    "the combination of nro45 and carma provided an unprecedented high image fidelity as well as a high angular resolution ( 3@xmath262 @xmath3 250 pc ) , which are critical for the accurate measurements of gas surface density and mass at high resolution .",
    "we discussed sfr and sfe quantitatively .",
    "our results are summarized as follows : +    1 .",
    "co emission is detected over the entire disk , i.e. , almost everywhere including interarm regions and the downstream side of the bar .",
    "there are remarkable concentrations along the offset ridges of the bar and in the ring structure in the nucleus ( r @xmath76 kpc area ) .",
    "the gas in the spiral arms extend from the end of the offset ridges toward the outer region .",
    "the surface densities in the outer spiral arms and offset ridges are similar at high resolution",
    ". 2 .   spatial offsets between h@xmath1 and co peaks",
    "exist along the spiral arms .",
    "h@xmath1 emission is seen at the downstream side of gas flow , while the co emission is upstream of the gas flow .",
    "the delay of star formation from the formation of gmc on spiral arms would cause such offsets .",
    "3 .   the azimuthal averaged sfe decreases steeply from the circumnuclear disk to the bar , and increases toward the spiral arms .",
    "the comparison of sfe in the bar and spiral arms shows that sfe is about twice as high in the arms as those of in the bar .",
    "extreme @xmath68 and sfe are found in the spiral arms , but not in the bar , indicating that the trigger of star formation is related not only to the amount of available gas , but also to the environment , such as galactic dynamics around spiral arms and the bar .",
    "the presence of the active star forming regions along the spiral arms confirms the visual impression that star formation is more active in spiral arms , or reduced significantly in bar .",
    "the sfe derived with a metallicity - dependent @xmath77 does not change the conclusion , i.e. higher sfe in the spiral arms than in the bar , since the difference between the bar and the spiral arms is reduced by only around 30@xmath66 .",
    "however , sfe in the circumnuclear regions is a factor of 2  3 higher than the results with the sfe derived by a standard @xmath77 , since metallicity of the circumnuclear is significantly high .",
    "the ks law appears to break down at our highest spatial resolution ( @xmath78 pc ) ; due to the spatial offsets we find between parental gas and star forming regions .",
    "the correlation reappears if we smooth the images to @xmath58 pc resolution .",
    "the least squares fit of all data in the ks law is @xmath73 .",
    "ngc 4303 lies roughly in the range of @xcite , though it has slightly higher sfe than average value among nearby galaxies .",
