    "the functions @xmath4 are solutions of second order ordinary differential equations .",
    "the symmetry group of laplace s equation is the conformal group and equivalence between various separable coordinate systems is established by the existence of a conformal transformation which maps one separable coordinate system to another .    in general , the coordinate surfaces ( called confocal cyclides )",

    "since the book by bcher is quite old and uses very geometrical methods , we will present our results independently of bcher s book .",

    "as far as we know this general theory has never before been applied to the dirichlet problems considered by bcher .",

    "we take the sphero - conal coordinate system as known but we present the needed facts in section [ sphero ] . the well - known stereographic projection is dealt with in section [ stereo ] which also explains the appearance of the factor @xmath27 in ( [ 1:sep ] ) .",
