    "this paper reports the first observation of the decay @xmath0 and a measurement of its branching ratio .",
    "the analysis was carried out on data taken during 2002 by the na48/1 experiment at the cern sps , which also recently reported the first observation of the decay @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the physics interest of the @xmath0 decay is that it measures the indirect cp violating contribution of the decay @xmath5 , thereby allowing the direct cp violating component of the @xmath6 decay to be extracted .",
    "this can provide input to the determination of the imaginary part of the element @xmath7 of the cabibbo , kobayashi , maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "in addition , the decay @xmath0 can be used to study the structure of the @xmath8 form factor .",
    "this is particularly interesting if combined with the @xmath4 results since both decays are expected to be dominated by the exchange of a single virtual photon ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the beam line and detector built by the na48 collaboration to measure the @xmath10 parameter @xcite from a comparison of @xmath11 decays was used , with the modifications described below .",
    "the experiment was performed at the cern sps accelerator and used a 400gev proton beam impinging on a be target to produce a neutral beam .",
    "the spill length was 4.8s out of a 16.8s cycle time .",
    "the proton intensity was fairly constant during the spill with a mean of @xmath12 protons per spill .",
    "the neutral kaon beam line was modified as follows : the  beam was blocked and a small , additional sweeping magnet was installed above the  collimator . in order to reduce the number of photons in the neutral beam , primarily from @xmath13 decays , a platinum absorber 24 mm thick was placed in the beam between the target and the main sweeping magnet which deflected charged particles into the collimator .",
    "the 5.1 m long  collimator , with its axis at an angle of 4.2mrad to the proton beam direction , selected a beam of neutral long - lived particles ( , , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 s , etc . ) . on average , there were @xmath18 decays per spill in the fiducial volume downstream of the collimator , with momenta between 60 and 200gev ( and a mean energy of @xmath19gev ) .",
    "an average of 0.017  decays were expected for every  decay within the first three  lifetimes from the end of the collimator .      in order to minimize interactions of the neutral beam ,",
    "the collimator was immediately followed by a 90 m long evacuated tank .",
    "the tank was terminated by a 0.3% radiation length(@xmath20 ) thick kevlar window , except in a region close to the beam which continued in a vacuum pipe through the centre of the downstream detectors .",
    "the tracking was performed with a spectrometer housed in a helium gas volume .",
    "it consisted of two drift chambers before and two after a dipole magnet with a horizontal transverse momentum kick of 265mev .",
    "each chamber had four views , each of which had two sense wire planes .",
    "the resulting space points were typically reconstructed with a resolution of 150@xmath21 m in each projection .",
    "the spectrometer momentum resolution was parameterised as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is in gev .",
    "this gave a resolution of 3mev on the reconstructed kaon mass in  decays .",
    "the track time resolution was 1.4ns .",
    "the detection and measurement of electromagnetic showers were performed with a 27@xmath20 deep liquid krypton calorimeter ( lkr ) .",
    "the energy resolution was parameterised as @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is in gev .",
    "the calorimeter was subdivided into 13,500 cells of transverse dimension 2 cm @xmath26 2 cm , which resulted in a transverse position resolution better than 1.3 mm for single photons with energy above 20gev .",
    "the @xmath13 mass resolution was 0.8mev , while the time resolution of the calorimeter for a single shower was better than 300ps .",
    "a scintillator hodoscope was located between the spectrometer and the lkr .",
    "it consisted of two planes , segmented in horizontal and vertical strips respectively , with each plane arranged in four quadrants .",
    "the time resolution for the hodoscope system was 200ps .",
    "downstream of the lkr calorimeter was an iron - scintillator sandwich hadron calorimeter(hcal ) , followed by muon counters(muc ) which consisted of three planes of plastic scintillators , each shielded by an 80 cm thick iron wall .",
    "the first two planes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , consisted of 25 cm wide horizontal ( @xmath27 ) and vertical ( @xmath28 ) scintillator strips , with a length of 2.7 m .",
    "the third plane , @xmath29 , consisted of horizontal strips of width 44.6 cm and was mainly used to measure the efficiency of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 counters .",
    "the central strip in each plane was split with a gap of 21 cm to accommodate the beam pipe .",
    "the fiducial volume of the experiment was principally determined by the lkr calorimeter acceptance , together with seven rings of scintillation counters which surrounded the decay volume to veto activity outside this region .",
    "the detector was sampled every 25ns , and samples were recorded in time windows of @xmath30ns .",
    "the extended time window allowed the rate of accidental activity to be investigated from the time sidebands .",
    "the trigger selection for  candidates consisted of a first - stage hardware trigger followed by a second - stage software trigger .",
    "the hardware trigger , for the first 40% of the data taken , selected events satisfying the following conditions :    * at least one hit in each of the horizontal and vertical planes of the hodoscope , within the same quadrant ; * at least three hit wires in at least three views of dch1 integrated over 200ns ; * a track vertex located within 90 m of the end of the collimator ; * no hit in the two ring scintillator counters farthest downstream ; * a two - muon signal ( @xmath31 ) from the muon counters .    the @xmath31 signal required at least two hits in each of the first two muon counter planes ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .    for the last 60% of the data taken , a second , parallel",

    "the @xmath32 signal was similar to the @xmath31 signal but allowed one of the first two muon planes ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) to contain only a single hit .",
    "the addition of the @xmath32 trigger significantly improved the trigger acceptance for the @xmath0 signal , as discussed below in section  [ sec : trig_effy ] .",
    "the software trigger ( for the entire data set ) required :    * at least two tracks in the drift chambers that were not associated with energetic(@xmath335gev ) clusters in the lkr ; * less than 10gev in the hadronic calorimeter ; * at least one hit in the first two muon counter planes .",
    "events that satisfied the trigger conditions were recorded and reprocessed with improved calibrations to obtain the final data sample .",
    "the signal channel  required the identification of two muons of opposite charge accompanied by two additional clusters ( photons ) in the lkr .",
    "the kaon energy was estimated from the sum of the track momenta and cluster energies and was required to be between 60 and 200gev .",
    "the invariant mass , @xmath34 , for the two muons from a @xmath0 decay is limited by kinematics to : @xmath35 where the lower limit corresponds to @xmath36 , while the upper limit is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the known mass was used as a constraint(see eq .",
    "[ eq : zk ] below ) to reconstruct the longitudinal vertex position using information from the charged tracks and the clusters .",
    "the invariant mass , @xmath38 , of the two photons was reconstructed using the measured positions and energies of the two clusters , assuming this vertex position .",
    "the total invariant mass , @xmath39 , was calculated using the vertex reconstructed from the charged tracks alone , with the known @xmath13 mass imposed as a constraint to improve the kaon mass resolution .",
    "the similarity between the kinematics of the 0pipi  and channels allowed the former channel to be used to evaluate the resolutions @xmath40 and @xmath41 on @xmath42 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "these were measured to be @xmath43mev and @xmath44mev , in agreement with a detailed monte carlo simulation based on geant  @xcite .",
    "a signal region and a control region were defined in the @xmath45 plane :    * _ signal region : _ + @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; * _ control region : _ + @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the signal and control regions were kept masked until the analysis cuts were finalised in order to keep the event selection unbiased . the cuts to reject the background",
    "were set using both data and monte carlo simulation .",
    "an extended control region was used to estimate the contributions from various backgrounds .      in order to identify muons , charged tracks reconstructed in the spectrometer",
    "were extrapolated to the muc planes and associated with muc hits using cuts on the spatial separation and time difference between the extrapolated track and the muc hit .",
    "multiple scattering was taken into account before applying the spatial cut , and light propagation along the muc strips was taken into account before applying the time - difference cut . for muons with momentum greater than 10gev , the efficiency of the muc counters was found to be @xmath50 .",

    "three quantities related to the decay vertex were computed :    * _ total vertex , @xmath58_. + to compute the longitudinal vertex position , @xmath58 , the kaon mass was assumed and the kinematical information from all the particles involved in the decay was used . the distance from the vertex to the lkr calorimeter , @xmath59 , was calculated as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the separation between the @xmath62th and @xmath63th particles in the lkr plane after linearly extrapolating charged tracks from before the spectrometer magnet , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the energy and the momentum of the @xmath62th particle .",

    "* _ @xmath13 vertex , @xmath69 _ . + the @xmath13 vertex position along the beam direction , @xmath69 , was computed in a similar way to the total vertex , but used only the two photon clusters and imposed the @xmath13 mass instead of the kaon mass as a constraint .",

    "the signal and control regions were unmasked .",
    "six events were found in the signal region , and none in the control region ( see fig.[fig : events ] ) .",
    "the kinematical quantities for these events are summarised in table  [ tab : events ] .",
    "there are two categories of background : _ physical background _ and _ accidental background_. physical background was defined as that due to a single kaon decay , for example @xmath76 , where the two charged pions decayed into muons .",
    "accidental background was caused by the overlap of particles coming from two separate decays that happened to be in time and faked the signal , for example , an overlap between the decays @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , where two photons missed the detector .",
    "the accidental background contained two components : ( a ) overlapping fragments from different proton interactions in the target ; and ( b ) fragments from associated production ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) due to a single proton interaction .",

    "using monte carlo simulation , the acceptance for @xmath85 decays in na48 was found to be @xmath86 .",
    "this small value originates from a geometrical acceptance of about 20% together with the low probability that the invariant mass of the two photons is consistent with the @xmath13 mass .",
