    "due to the explosive growth of wireless devices and data services , increasing network capacity has become a critical target for the current and future wireless networks . as well concluded from pioneer research",
    ", intercell - inteference is a key factor limiting the overall spectral efficiency offered by wireless technologies @xcite .",
    "schemes turning interference from nuisance to the users benefit , such as cooperative multipoint ( comp ) processing has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the central idea is to allow for joint processing by multiple transmitters , thereby turning the interference to useful signals @xcite .",
    "the two main forms of comp processing are interference coordination and data sharing . in the latter ,",
    "data for a specific is transmitted from multiple base stations ( bss ) , which is the focus of this paper .",
    "the promise of multicell bs cooperation is often seen under the assumption that the backhaul network is able to deliver an enormous signaling overhead from a central processor ( cp ) to all bss . in practice ,",
    "the capacity of the backhaul communications is limited , especially , with wireless backhauling @xcite .",
    "therefore , a number of recent research efforts have investigated solutions to optimize various performance measures in finite - capacity backhaul networks for different system models .",
    "those include , e.g. , sum rate maximization @xcite , joint backhaul and power minimization @xcite , energy efficiency maximization @xcite , and backhaul usage minimization @xcite . to deal with the backhaul constraint in particular , the aforementioned works have adopted a bs - user link selection scheme where each bs in the network transmits data to only a proper subset of users in order to reduce the backhaul consumed .",
    "this paper is to explore the optimal performance of maximizing the sum rate of cooperative multicell downlink under limited backhaul capacity constraints .",
    "in particular , we propose a beamforming design to maximize the achievable sum rate while satisfying per - bs backhaul capacity , per - bs power constraints , and user - specific signal - to - interference - noise ( sinr ) requirements .",
    "the latter condition ensures the minimum quality of service for each user regardless of the user s location in a cell . to cope with the backhaul limitation ,",
    "a bs - user link selection scheme is necessary and will be studied in this paper .",
    "thus , the resulting problem is in fact a joint beamforming and bs - user link selection design which naturally leads to a mixed - boolean non - convex program ( mbnp ) , which is generally known to be np - hard and optimal solutions are hard to derive .",
    "a suboptimal solution based on reweighted @xmath0-norm was proposed for a similar problem in the considered context @xcite .",
    "although this approach yields solutions with reasonably low complexity , its achieved performance in relation to the optimal one has not been investigated yet . to fill this gap",
    ", we propose an algorithm that achieves a global optimum of the design problem .",
    "the proposed method is based on a discrete monotonic optimization ( dmo ) framework which is difficult to connect to the original problem formulation .",
    "in particular , the hidden monotonicity of the considered problem is exposed by a novel proposed transformation .",
    "this then facilitates an efficient customization of a discrete brach - reduce - and - bound ( dbrb ) method to find a global optimum .",
    "numerical results are provided to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed optimal algorithm and the performance gains over known methods .",
    "consider a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) downlink transmission of wireless systems where there are @xmath1 multiple - antenna bss , each is equipped with @xmath2 antennas , jointly serving @xmath3 single - antenna users .",
    "suppose that all bss in the network are connected to a cp through backhaul links of limited capacity .",
    "we also assume that the cp has the data of all users and perfectly knows the associated channel state information ( csi ) and the necessary control information .",
    "the data symbol for user @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 , assumed to have unit energy , i.e. , @xmath6=1 $ ] .",
    "herein , we adopt linear precoding , i.e. , @xmath5 is multiplied with beamformer @xmath7 before being transmitted by bs @xmath8 . accordingly , under flat fading channels , the received signal @xmath9 of user @xmath4 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( row ) vector representing the channel of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the additive white gaussian noise at user @xmath4",
    ". for notational simplicity , let @xmath14\\in\\mathbb{c}^{1\\times mb}$ ] and @xmath15^{t}$ ] @xmath16 be the aggregate vectors of all channels and beamformers from all bss to user @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we also denote by @xmath17 the beamforming vector encompassing all @xmath18 .",
    "we further assume that single - user decoding is performed . in this regard ,",
    "the intercell - interference is treated as gaussian noise , and thus the sinr at user @xmath4 can be written as @xmath19 the data rate of user @xmath4 is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bandwidth . to simplify the notation",
    ", we will drop @xmath21 in the sequel .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the selection preference variable where @xmath23 indicates that transmission link between bs @xmath8 and user @xmath4 is active and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "the backhaul usage of bs @xmath8 is the sum of data streams of its served users given by @xmath25 which is upper bounded by a link capacity @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 . to reduce the backhaul usage ,",
    "bs @xmath8 can turn off transmissions to some users .",
    "that is , the cp does not deliver those users information to bs @xmath8 .",
    "also , beamformers associated to inactive transmissions are forced to be zero , i.e. , @xmath28 if @xmath24 . to capture this relation ,",
    "we introduce the constraint @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents a soft power level of @xmath31 and will be optimized under the considered power constraint .",
    "based on the above discussions , the problem of joint beamforming design and bs - user link selection which maximizes the sum rate subject to user - specific sinr requirements , per - bs backhaul capacity and power constraints can be formulated as    [ prob : gen : problem ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the per - user targeted sinr , and @xmath34 is the per - bs transmit power budget .",
    "we also denoted @xmath35^{t}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{bk}$ ] and @xmath36^{t}\\in\\mathbb{r}_{+}^{bk}$ ] .",
    "herein is added to ensure each user is always served by at least one bs .",
    "note that user - specific sinr constraint can be represented as an soc constraint following the results in @xcite as @xmath37 it is now clear that problem belongs to the class of mbnp due to the boolean variable @xmath38 , the nonconvex objective and the nonconvex constraint . recall that a suboptimal solution for this problem was proposed in @xcite using a sparsity inducing norm approach .",
    "thus , there is a need to understand its achieved performance , and to see if there is a room for improvement .",
    "we derive an algorithm which globally solves by customizing a state - of - the - art global discrete optimization technique namely discrete monotonic optimization .",
    "this framework has been applied to find a global optimum of different mbnp problems in wireless communications @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that although continuous monotonic optimization ( mo ) @xcite can also handle discrete constraints in by writing @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "however it potentially returns only approximate solutions by a finite number of iterations .",
    "thus , dmo has been developed in @xcite to compute exact optimal solutions . in this section",
    ", we will adapt the discrete branch - reduce - and - bound strategy in dmo , to solve the design problem . before proceeding further",
    ", we remark that basic concepts of the mo such as _ increasing function _ , _ normal cone _ and _ box _ are used throughout the rest of this section .",
    "their definitions can be found in @xcite and are omitted in this paper due to space limitation .",
    "the current formulation of the design problem is not amendable for a direct application of the dbrb since does not hold the monotonicity property w.r.t . the involved variables .",
    "thus , a further proper translation is required . for this purpose ,",
    "let us introduce new slack variable @xmath40 and rewrite as    [ prob : se : epi ] @xmath41    where @xmath42^{t}$ ] .",
    "the equivalence between and can be verified as holds with equality at the optimum .",
    "now we can observe that a better objective of is always achieved if we keep increasing each of @xmath40 as long as it is still in the feasible set of .",
    "in addition , the feasibility of @xmath43 is established depending on @xmath38 as can be seen in .",
    "furthermore , constraint is monotone w.r.t . @xmath43 and @xmath38 .",
    "these three observations imply that is suitable for a direct application of the dbrb to find the optimal solutions of @xmath43 and @xmath38 . before describing the details",
    ", we introduce new notations for the ease of exposition .",
    "let @xmath44^{t}\\in\\mathbb{r}_{+}^{n_{x}+n_{z}}$ ] be the variable vector of interest where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are dimensions of the boolean and continuous vectors @xmath38 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath47 be the feasible set of problem , i.e. , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath47 is normal and finite since it is upper bounded by the power and backhaul constraints .",
    "additionally , the feasible set @xmath47 is contained in a box @xmath50\\in\\mathbb{r}_{+}^{n}$ ] whose vertices are determined as follows .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 since @xmath54 . on the other hand",
    ", variable @xmath40 is bounded below by @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , we can verify @xmath56 .",
    "that is to say , for @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 . to sum up , the lower and upper vertices of box @xmath61 are given by @xmath62\\\\   & { \\bf b}=[{\\bf 1}_{n_{x}},\\ \\left\\ { \\min\\{b\\bar{c},\\ \\log(1+b\\bar{p}\\|{\\bf h}_{k}\\|_{2}^{2}/wn_{0})\\}\\right\\ } _ { k=1}^{n_{z}}],\\vspace{-3mm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote vectors of all zero and one values of the size given in the subscripts , respectively . at this line , problem can be compactly rewritten as @xmath66 we are now ready to describe the dbrb algorithm to solve optimally .",
    "generally , this method is an iterative procedure consisting of three basic operations at each iteration : _ branching _ , _ reduction , _ and _ bounding_. more specifically , starting from the box @xmath67 $ ] , we iteratively divide it into smaller and smaller ones , remove boxes that do not contain an optimal solution , search over remaining boxes for a better optimal solution until fulfilling the stopping criterion .",
    "different to the continuous procedure , to guarantee the exact solution of the boolean variable , @xmath68 first elements on the cutting plane of boxes are adjusted to be dropped in the boolean set during the branching and reduction operations .",
    "the adjustment rule is motivated by the monotonicity property to ensure not cutting off any feasible solution @xcite .",
    "the algorithm terminates when the size of boxes containing the optimal solution is small enough .",
    "dbrb algorithm is described in alg .",
    "brb ] where details are given as follows .",
    "for notational convenience , we denote by @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 the current best objective ( _ cbo _ ) , the set of boxes containing an optimal solution at iteration @xmath73 , the upper bound and lower bound value of @xmath74 over box @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "we start iteration @xmath73 by selecting a box in @xmath70 and splitting it into two smaller ones .",
    "a candidate box @xmath76 for branching is picked up by the improving bound rule @xcite , i.e. , @xmath77 . the selected box @xmath78 $ ] is then bisected along the longest edge , i.e. , @xmath79 , to create two new boxes which are of equal size as @xmath80 & \\bm{\\text{if } } j\\leq n_{x},\\\\ { } [ { \\bf p},\\ { \\bf q}-{\\bf e}_{j}(q_{i}-p_{i})/2 ] & \\bm{\\text{if } } j > n_{x } , \\end{cases}\\\\ v_{\\text{c}}^{(2)}=\\begin{cases } [ { \\bf p}+{\\bf e}_{j},\\ { \\bf q } ] & \\bm{\\text{if } } j\\leq n_{x},\\\\ { } [ { \\bf p}+{\\bf",

    ", it possibly contains segments which are either infeasible solutions to or solutions resulting in a smaller objective than @xmath69 .",
    "thanks to the monotonicity property , we can remove those portions of no interest by a cutting procedure referred as reduction operation .",
    "suppose that the input of this operation is box @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 is assumed to contain an optimal solution .",
    "we aim at reducing the size of the solution set without loss of optimality by searching for a smaller box @xmath84 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath85\\subset[{\\bf p},{\\bf q}]$ ] such that an optimal solution must be contained in @xmath86 .",
    "that is , if all vectors belonging to portion @xmath87 result in a smaller objective value ( @xmath88 ) and/or be outside the feasible set of ( @xmath89 ) , the portion @xmath87 must be cut off .",
    "on the other hand , we remove the portion @xmath90 $ ] if any vector in the set is infeasible to .",
    "mathematically , for each @xmath91 , we can replace @xmath92 by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 similarly , vertex set @xmath96 is replaced by @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 in and can be found easily by the bisection method . for @xmath102 , the output of the reduction task should be nested in the boolean set , i.e. , @xmath103 since they correspond to the boolean variable .",
    "thus , by replacing @xmath104 into for @xmath102 , we can quickly achieve that @xmath105 .",
    "if it results in @xmath106 , we then replace @xmath107 into and achieve @xmath108 . as have been proved in @xcite that the reduction procedure above does not drop off any feasible solution of .",
    "we refer the output of the reduction operation with the input box @xmath82 $ ] as @xmath109)$ ] .",

    "cbo_. the upper and lower bounds of box @xmath109)=[{\\bf p}^{\\prime},{\\bf q}^{\\prime}]$ ] can be simply computed as @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , due to the monotonic increase of the objective . however , this often results in slow convergence rate .",
    "instead , we now consider a better bound computation for box @xmath85 $ ] as follows .",
    "recall that problem is np hard due to the boolean variable @xmath38 and nonconvex constraints , .",
    "nevertheless , we can compute the upper bound of @xmath74 by a convex relaxation of .",
    "that is , we replace the left side of by its convex envelope , i.e. , @xmath117 where @xmath118 for @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath121 and @xmath122 correspond to elements in @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the right side of can be replaced by its lower bound as @xmath125 then , by treating @xmath38 as a continuous variable vector , the upper bound of @xmath74 is computed by solving the following socp problem    [ eq : se : socp : bound ] @xmath126    where is the soc representation of when @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath128 be the optimal objective where @xmath129 denotes the solution of .",
    "although @xmath130 may not be feasible to as discrete constraint is neglected , we can still achieve that @xmath131 @xcite .",

    "we can establish @xmath132 by some insights gained from the optimal solution to .",
    "particularly , we can see that the smallest elements of soft power level @xmath134 imply the less contribution of corresponding transmission links in satisfying .",
    "to this point , a feasible selection vector @xmath38 may be determined by turning off those transmission links ( i.e. , force @xmath135 if @xmath136 is small enough and set the remaining ones @xmath1371 ) . on the other hand ,",
