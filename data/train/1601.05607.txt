    "as the first force recognized among the four fundamental interactions , gravity is mysterious and fascinating because of its unique feature .",
    "gravity is universal , which is well known from the epoch of newton s theory .",
    "nothing could escape the control of gravity , from the falling of apple towards the earth , to the motion of moon in the sky . in einstein s general relativity , gravity is related to the geometry of curved spacetime .",
    "this beautiful and elegant idea significantly influences our world view .",
    "spacetime is curved by matter / energy , while the motion of object is along the `` straight '' line ( geodesic ) of the curved spacetime .",
    "general relativity has passed all experimental tests up to now . however , there is intrinsic conflict between quantum theory and general relativity .",
    "lots of efforts have been made to quantize gravity , but no success has been achieved yet .",
    "gravity is extremely weak compared to the other fundamental forces , so it is usually ignored in micro - physics .",
    "nonetheless , on the scale of universe , things are mostly controlled by gravity because it is long - range and has no screening effect .",
    "one century has passed since einstein established general relativity , but only a few solutions to the field equation have been found , among which three solutions are most famous and useful . the most simple case is for static and spherical spacetime , and the solution was derived by schwarzschild just one month after einstein s field equation .",
    "the schwarzschild solution indicates also the existence of black hole , where everything is doomed to fall towards the center after passing through the event horizon . consider a non - vancum case with ideal fluid as source",
    ", the field equation could be transformed to tolman - oppenheimer - vokoff equation@xcite , which could be applied to the interior of pulsar - like compact stars .",
    "based on the so - called cosmological copernicus principle , friedmann equation can be derived with the assumption of homogenous and isotropic universe , which sets the foundation of cosmology .",
    "these three solutions of einstein s field equation represent the most frontier topics in modern astrophysics .    at the late stage of stellar evolution ,",
    "how does the core of massive star collapse to a black hole ? or equivalently , how is normal baryonic matter squeezed into the singularity ? what s the state of compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) before collapsing into a black hole ?",
    "we are focusing on these questions in this chapter . in the standard model of particle physics , there are totally six flavours of quarks . among them , three ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 ) are light , with masses @xmath19 mev , while other three flavours ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , with mass @xmath23 mev , are too heavy to be excited in the nuclear energy scale , @xmath24 mev .",
    "however , the ordinary matter in our world is built from @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks only , and the numbers of these two flavours tend to be balanced in a stable nucleus .",
    "it is then interesting to think philosophically about the fact that our baryonic matter is 2-flavour symmetric .",
    "an explanation could be : micro - nuclei are too small to have 3-flavour symmetry , but bigger is different .",
    "in fact , rational thinking about stable strangeness dates back to 1970s@xcite , in which bodmer speculated that so - called `` collapsed nuclei '' with strangeness could be energetically favored if baryon number @xmath25 , but without quantitative estimation of the minimal number @xmath26 .",
    "bulk matter composed of almost _ free _ quarks ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 ) was then focused on@xcite , even for astrophysical manifestations@xcite .",
    "cbm can manifest as a pulsar if the mass is not large enough to form a black hole , and strange quark matter could possibly exist in compact stars , either in the core of neutron star ( i.e. , mixed or hybrid stars@xcite ) or as the whole star ( strange quark star@xcite ) . although the asymptotic freedom is well recognized ,",
    "one essential point is whether the color coupling between quarks is still perturbative in astrophysical cbm so that quarks are itinerant there . in case of non - perturbative coupling ,",
    "the strong force there might render quarks grouped in so - called _ quark - clusters _ , forming a nucleus - like strange object@xcite with 3-flavour symmetry , when cbm is big enough that relativistic electrons are inside ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) .",
    "anyway , we could simply call 3-flavour baryonic matter as _ strange matter _ , in which the constituent quarks could be either itinerant or localized .",
    "why is big cbm strange ?",
    "this is actually a conjecture to be extensively discussed in the next section , but it could be reasonable .",
    "besides being meaningful for understanding the nature of sub - nucleon at a deeper level , strangeness would also have a consequence of the physics of super - dense matter .",
    "the discovery of strangeness ( a general introduction to murray gell - mann and his strangeness could be found in the biography by johnson@xcite ) is known as a milestone in particle physics since our normal baryons are non - strange .",
    "nonetheless , condensed matter with strangeness should be worth exploring as the energy scale @xmath28 at the nuclear and even supra - nuclear densities .",
    "previously , bulk strange object ( suggested to be 3-flavour _ quark _ matter ) is speculated to be the absolutely stable ground state of strong - interaction matter , which is known as the bodmer - witten s conjecture.@xcite but we are discussing a general conjecture in next subsections , arguing that quarks might not be necessarily free in stable strange matter , and would still be hadron - like localized as in a nucleus if non - perturbative qcd effects are significant ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) and the repulsive core keeps to work in both cases of 2-flavour ( non - strange ) nuclear matter and 3-flavour ( strange ) matter . in this sense ,",
    "protons and neutrons are of 2-flavour quark clusters , while strange matter could be condensed matter of quark clusters with strangeness ( i.e. , strange quark - clusters ) .",
    "summarily , it is well known that micro - nuclei are non - strange , but macro - nuclei in the form of cbm could be strange .",
    "therefore , astrophysical cbm and nucleus could be very similar , but only with a simple change from non - strange to strange : `` 2 '' @xmath30 `` 3 '' .",
    "we are explaining two approaches to this strange quark - cluster matter state , bottom - up and top - down , respectively as following .",
    "micro - nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons , and there is an observed tendency to have equal numbers of protons ( @xmath31 ) and neutrons ( @xmath32 ) . in liquid - drop model ,",
    "the mass formula of a nucleus with atomic number @xmath33 consists of five terms , @xmath34 where the third term is for the symmetry energy , which vanishes with equal number of protons and neutrons .",
    "this nuclear symmetry energy represents a symmetry between proton and neutron in the nucleon degree of freedom , and is actually that of @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks in the quark degree@xcite .",
    "the underlying physics of symmetry energy is not well understood yet . if the nucleons are treated as fermi gas , there is a term with the same form as symmetry energy in the formula of fermi energy , known as the kinetic term of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "but the interaction is not negligible , and the potential term of symmetry energy would be significant .",
    "recent scattering experiments show that , because of short - range interactions , the neutron - proton pairs are nearly 20 times as prevalent as proton - proton ( and neutron - neutron by inference ) pairs,@xcite which hints that the potential term would dominate in the symmetry energy .",
    "since the electric charges of @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks is + 2/3 are -1/3 respectively , 2-flavour symmetric strong - interaction matter should be positively charged , and electrons are needed to keep electric neutrality .",
    "the possibility of electrons inside a nucleus is negligible because the nuclear radius is much smaller than the compton wavelength @xmath35 , and the lepton degree of freedom would then be not significant for nucleus .",
    "therefore , electrons contribute negligible energy for micro - nuclei , as the coupling constant of electromagnetic interaction ( @xmath36 ) is much less than that of strong interaction ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the kinematic motion of electrons is bound by electromagnetic interaction , so @xmath38 . from heisenberg s relation , @xmath39 , combining the above two equations , we have @xmath40 , and the interaction energy is order of @xmath41 .",
    "however , bigger is different , and there might be 3-flavour symmetry in gigantic / macro - nuclei , as electrons are inside a gigantic nucleus . with the number of nucleons @xmath42 , the scale of macro - nuclei should be larger than the compton wavelength of electrons @xmath35 .",
    "if 2-flavour symmetry keeps , macro - nucleus will become a huge thomson atom with electrons evenly distributed there .",
    "though coulomb energy could not be significant , the fermi energy of electrons are not negligible , to be @xmath43",
    ". however , the situation becomes different if strangeness is included : no electrons exist if the matter is composed by equal numbers of light quarks of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 in chemical equilibrium . in this case , the 3-flavor symmetry , an analogy of the symmetry of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in nucleus , may results in a ground state of matter for gigantic nuclei .",
    "certainly the mass difference between @xmath7/@xmath8 and @xmath10 quarks would also break the 3-flavour symmetry , but the interaction between quarks could lower the effect of mass differences and favor the restoration of 3-flavour symmetry . if macro - nuclei are almost 3-flavour symmetric , the contribution of electrons would be negligible , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the new degree of freedom ( strangeness ) is also possible to be excited , according to an order - of - magnitude estimation from either heisenberg s relation ( localized quarks ) or fermi energy ( free quarks ) . for quarks localized with length scale @xmath46 , from heisenberg s uncertainty relation ,",
    "the kinetic energy would be of @xmath47 , which has to be comparable to the color interaction energy of @xmath48 in order to have a bound state , with an assumption of coulomb - like strong interaction .",
    "one can then have if quarks are dressed , @xmath49 as @xmath37 may well be close to and even greater than 1 at several times the nuclear density , the energy scale would be approaching and even larger than @xmath50400 mev .",
    "a further calculation of fermi energy also gives , @xmath51 if quarks are considered moving non - relativistically , or @xmath52 if quarks are considered moving extremely relativistically .",
    "so we have the energy scale @xmath53 by either heisenberg s relation or fermi energy , which could certainly be larger the mass difference ( @xmath54 ) between @xmath10 and @xmath55 quarks , however , for micro - nuclei where electron contributes also negligible energy , there could be 2-flavour ( rather than 3-flavour ) symmetry because @xmath10 quark mass is larger than @xmath55 quark masses .",
    "we now understand that it is more economical to have 2-flavour micro - nuclei because of massive @xmath10-quark and negligible electron kinematic energy , whereas macro / gigantic - nuclei might be 3-flavour symmetric .",
    "the 2-flavour micro - nucleus consists of @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks grouped in nucleons , while the 3-flavour macro - nucleus is made up of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 quarks grouped in so - called strange quark - clusters .",
    "such macro - nucleus with 3-flavour symmetry can be named as strange quark - cluster matter , or simply strange matter .      besides this bottom - up scenario ( an approach from the hadronic state )",
    ", we could also start from deconfined quark state with the inclusion of stronger and stronger interaction between quarks ( a top - down scenario ) .",
    "the underlying theory of the elementary strong interaction is believed to be quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , a non - abelian _",
    "su_(3 ) gauge theory . in qcd ,",
    "the effective coupling between quarks decreases with energy ( the _ asymptotic freedom_)@xcite .",
    "quark matter ( or quark - gluon plasma ) , the soup of deconfined quarks and gluons , is a direct consequence of asymptotic freedom when temperature or baryon density are extremely enough . hot quark matter could be reproduced in the experiments of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "ultra - high chemical potential is required to create cold quark matter , and it can only exist in rare astrophysical conditions , the compact stars .    what kind of cold matter can we expect from qcd theory , in effective models , or even based on phenomenology ? this is a question too hard to answer because of ( i ) the non - perturbative effects of strong interaction between quarks at low energy scales and ( ii ) the many - body problem due to vast assemblies of interacting particles . a color - superconductivity ( csc ) state",
    "is focused on in qcd - based models , as well as in phenomenological ones@xcite .",
    "the ground state of extremely dense quark matter could certainly be that of an ideal fermi gas at an extremely high density .",
    "nevertheless , it has been found that the highly degenerate fermi surface could be unstable against the formation of quark cooper pairs , which condense near the fermi surface due to the existence of color - attractive channels between the quarks .",
    "a bcs - like color superconductivity , similar to electric superconductivity , has been formulated within perturbative qcd at ultra - high baryon densities .",
    "it has been argued , based on qcd - like effective models , that color superconductivity could also occur even at the more realistic baryon densities of pulsar - like compact stars@xcite .",
    "can the realistic stellar densities be high enough to justify the use of perturbative qcd ?",
    "it is surely a challenge to calculate the coupling constant , @xmath56 , from first principles . nevertheless , there are some approaches to the non - perturbative effects of qcd , one of which uses the dyson - schwinger equations tried by fischer et al.,@xcite who formulated , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 with @xmath63 the typical momentum in gev , and that @xmath56 freezes at @xmath64 . for our case of",
    "assumed dense quark matter at @xmath65 , the chemical potential is @xmath66 gev , and then @xmath67 gev@xmath68 .",
    "thus , it appears that the coupling in realistic dense quark matter should be greater than 2 , being close to 3 in the fischer s estimate presented in eq.([dse ] ) .",
    "therefore , this surely means that a weakly coupling treatment could be dangerous for realistic cold quark matter ( the interaction energy @xmath69 mev could even be much larger than the fermi energy ) , i.e. , the non - perturbative effect in qcd should not be negligible if we try to know the real state of compact stars .",
    "it is also worth noting that the dimensionless electromagnetic coupling constant ( i.e. , the fine - structure constant ) is @xmath70 , which makes qed tractable .",
    "that is to say , a weakly coupling strength comparable with that of qed is possible in qcd only if the density is unbelievably and unrealistically high ( @xmath71 ! with @xmath72 @xmath73 the baryon density of nuclear matter ) .",
    "quark - clusters may form in relatively low temperature quark matter due to the strong interaction ( i.e. , large @xmath56 ) , and the clusters could locate in periodic lattices ( normal solid ) when temperature becomes sufficiently low .",
    "although it is hitherto impossible to know if quark - clusters could form in cold quark matter via calculation from first principles , there could be a few points that favor clustering .",
    "_ experimentally _ , though quark matter is argued to be weakly coupled at high energy and thus deconfined , it is worth noting that , as revealed by the recent achievements in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments , the interaction between quarks in a fireball of quarks and gluons is still very strong ( i.e. the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma , sqgp@xcite ) .",
    "the strong coupling between quarks may naturally render quarks grouped in clusters , i.e. , a condensation in position space rather than in momentum space .",
    "_ theoretically _ , the baryon - like particles in quarkyonic matter@xcite might be grouped further due to residual color interaction if the baryon density is not extremely high , and quark - clusters would form then at only a few nuclear density .",
    "certainly , more elaborate research work is necessary .",
    "for cold quark matter at @xmath74 density , the distance between quarks is @xmath50 fm @xmath11 the planck scale @xmath75 , so quarks and electrons can well be approximated as point - like particles .",
    "if q@xmath76-like clusters are created in the quark matter@xcite , the distance between clusters are @xmath77 .",
    "the length scale @xmath46 and color interaction energy of quark - clusters has been estimated by the uncertainty relation , assuming quarks are as dressed ( the constituent quark mass is @xmath78 mev ) and move non - relativistically in a cluster .",
    "we have @xmath79 fm if @xmath80 , and the color interaction energy @xmath81 could be greater than the baryon chemical potential if @xmath82 .",
    "the strong coupling could render quarks grouped in position space to form clusters , forming a nucleus - like strange object@xcite with 3-flavour symmetry , if it is big enough that relativistic electrons are inside ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) .",
    "quark - clusters could be considered as classical particles in cold quark - cluster matter and would be in lattices at a lower temperature .    in conclusion",
    ", quark - clusters could emerge in cold dense matter because of the strong coupling between quarks .",
    "the quark - clustering phase has high density and the strong interaction is still dominant , so it is different from the usual hadron phase , and on the other hand , the quark - clustering phase is also different from the conventional quark matter phase which is composed of relativistic and weakly interacting quarks . the quark - clustering phase could be considered as an intermediate state between hadron phase and free - quark phase , with deconfined quarks grouped into quark - clusters .      in summary , there could be some similarities and differences between micro - nuclei and macro - nuclei , listed as following .",
    "_ similarity _ 1 : both micro - nuclei and macro - nuclei are self - bound by the strong color interaction , in which quarks are localized in groups called generally as quark - clusters .",
    "we are sure that there are two kinds of quark - clusters inside micro - nuclei , the proton ( with structure @xmath83 ) and neutron ( @xmath84 ) , but do nt know well the clusters in macro - nuclei due to the lack of detailed experiments related .",
    "_ similarity _ 2 : since the strong interaction might not be very sensitive to flavour , the interaction between general quark - clusters should be similar to that of nucleon , which is found to be lennard - jones - like by both experiment and modeling . especially , one could then expect a hard core@xcite ( or repulsive core ) of the interaction potential between strange quark - clusters though no direct experiment now hints this existence .    _ difference _ 1 : the most crucial difference is the change of flavour degree of freedom , from two ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) in micro - nuclei to three ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 ) in macro / gigantic - nuclei .",
    "we could thus have following different aspects derived .",
    "_ difference _ 2 : the number of quarks in a quark - cluster is 3 for micro nuclei , but could be 6 , 9 , 12 , and even 18 for macro nuclei , since the interaction between @xmath85-particles could be attractive@xcite so that no positive pressure can support a gravitational star of @xmath85-cluster matter .",
    "we therefore call proton / neutron as light quark - clusters , while the strange quark - cluster as heavy clusters because of ( 1 ) massive @xmath10-quark and ( 2 ) large number of quarks inside",
    ".    _ difference _ 3 : a micro nucleus could be considered as a quantum system so that one could apply quantum mean - field theory , whereas the heavy clusters in strange matter may be classical particles since the quantum wavelength of massive clusters might be even smaller than the mean distance between them .",
    "_ difference _ 4 : the equation of state ( eos ) of strange matter would be stiffer@xcite than that of nuclear matter because the clusters in former should be non - relativistic but relativistic in latter .",
    "the kinematic energy of a cluster in both micro- and macro - nuclei could be @xmath86 , which is much smaller than the rest mass ( generally @xmath87 ) of a strange quark - cluster .",
    "_ difference _ 5 : condensed matter of strange quark - clusters could be in a solid state at low temperature much smaller than the interaction energy between clusters .",
    "we could then expect solid pulsars@xcite in nature although an idea of solid nucleus was also addressed@xcite a long time ago .",
    "the 3-flavour symmetry may hint the nature of strong interaction at low - energy scale .",
    "let s tell a story of science fiction about flavour symmetry .",
    "our protagonist is a fairy who is an expert in qcd at high energy scale ( i.e. , perturbative qcd ) but knows little about spectacular non - perturbative effects .",
    "there is a conversation between the fairy and god about strong - interaction matter .",
    "god : `` i know six flavours of quarks , but how many flavours could there exist in stable strong - interaction matter ? ''    fairy : `` it depends ... how dense is the matter ?",
    "(: the nuclear saturation density arises from the short - distance repulsive core , a consequence of non - perturbative qcd effect she may not know much . ) ''    god : `` hum ... i am told that quark number density is about 0.48 @xmath73(@xmath74 ) there . ''",
    "fairy : `` ah , in this energy scale of @xmath88 gev , there could only be light flavours ( i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 ) in a stable matter if quarks are free . ''",
    "god : `` two flavours ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) or three flavours ? ''    fairy : `` there could be two flavours of free quarks if strong - interaction matter is very small ( @xmath16 ) , but would be three flavours for bulk strong - interaction matter (: the bodmer - witten s conjecture ) . ''",
    "god : `` small 2-flavour strong - interaction matter is very useful , and i can make life and mankind with huge numbers of the pieces . we can call them atoms . ''    fairy : `` thanks , god !",
    "i can also help mankind to have better life . ''",
    "god : `` but ... are quarks really free there ? ''    fairy : `` hum ... there could be clustered quarks in both two and three flavour (: a bodmer - witten s conjecture generalized ) cases if the interaction between quarks is so strong that quarks are grouped together .",
    "you name a piece of small two flavour matter _ atom _",
    ", what would we call a 3-flavour body in bulk ?",
    "''    god : oh ... simply , a _",
    "strange _ object because of strangeness .",
    "cold strange matter with 3-flavour symmetry could be in a solid state because of ( 1 ) a relatively small quantum wave packet of quark - cluster ( wave length @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the separation between quark - clusters ) and ( 2 ) low temperature @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is the interaction energy between quark - clusters )",
    ". the packet scales @xmath93 for free quark - cluster , with @xmath94 the rest mass of a quark cluster , but could be much smaller if it is constrained in a potential with depth of @xmath95 mev ( 2 @xmath96 ) . a star made of strange matter would then be a solid star .",
    "it is very fundamental to study static and spherically symmetric gravitational sources in general relativity , especially for the interior solutions .",
    "the tov solution@xcite is only for perfect fluid .",
    "however , for solid strange stars , since the local press could be _ anisotropic _ in elastic matter , the radial pressure gradient could be partially balanced by the tangential shear force although a general understanding of relativistic , elastic bodies has unfortunately not been achieved@xcite",
    ". the origin of this local anisotropic force in solid quark stars could be from the development of elastic energy as a star ( i ) spins down ( its ellipticity decreases ) and ( ii ) cools ( it may shrink ) .",
    "release of the elastic as well as the gravitational energies would be not negligible , and may have significant astrophysical implications .",
    "the structure of solid quark stars can be numerically calculated as following . for the sack of simplicity , only spherically symmetric sources are dealt with , in order to make sense of possible astrophysical consequence of solid quark stars . by introducing respectively radial and tangential pressures , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the stellar equilibrium equation of static anisotropic matter in newtonian gravity is@xcite : @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote mass density and the gravitational constant , respectively , and @xmath102 . however , in einstein s gravity , this equilibrium equation is modified to be@xcite , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is introduced . in case of isotropic pressure , @xmath105 , eq .",

    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) that the radial pressure gradient , @xmath106 , decreases if @xmath107 , which may result in a higher maximum mass of compact stars .",
    "one can also see that a sudden decrease of @xmath98 ( equivalently of elastic force ) in a star may cause substantial energy release , since the star s radius decreases and the absolute gravitational energy increases .",
    "starquakes may result in a sudden change of @xmath108 , with an energy release of the gravitational energy as well as the tangential strain energy .",
    "generally , it is evident that the differences of radius , gravitational energy , and moment of inertia increase proportionally to stellar mass and the parameter @xmath108 .",
    "this means that an event should be more important for a bigger change of @xmath108 in a quark star with higher mass .",
    "typical energy of @xmath109 is released during superflares of sgrs , and a giant starquake with @xmath110 could produce such a flare@xcite .",
    "a sudden change of @xmath108 can also result in a jump of spin frequency , @xmath111 .",
    "glitches with @xmath112 could occur for parameters of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "it is suggestive that a giantflare may accompany a high - amplitude glitch .",
    "how to create macro - nuclei ( even gigantic ) in the universe ? besides a collapse event where normal baryonic matter is intensely compressed by gravity , strange matter could also be produced after cosmic hadronization.@xcite strange matter may manifest itself as a variety of objects with a broad mass spectrum , including compact objects , cosmic rays and even dark matter .      in 1932 , soon after chandrasekhar found a unique mass ( the mass limit of white dwarfs ) , landau speculated a state of matter , the density of which `` becomes so great that atomic nuclei come in close contact , forming one _ gigantic nucleus_''@xcite .",
    "a star composed mostly of such matter is called a `` neutron '' star , and baade and zwicky even suggested in 1934 that neutron stars ( nss ) could be born after supernovae .",

    "more kinds of pulsar - like stars , such as x - ray pulsars and x - ray bursts in binary systems , were also discovered later , and all of them are suggested to be nss .    in gigantic nucleus , protons and electrons combined to form the neutronic state , which involves weak equilibrium between protons and neutrons . however , the simple and beautiful idea proposed by landau and others had one flaw at least : nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) are in fact _ not _ structureless point - like particles although they were thought to be elementary particles in 1930s .",
    "a success in the classification of hadrons discovered in cosmic rays and in accelerators leaded gell - mann to coin `` _ quark _ '' with fraction charges ( @xmath115 ) in mathematical description , rather than in reality@xcite .",
    "all the six flavors of quarks ( @xmath116 ) have experimental evidence ( the evidence for the last one , top quark , was reported in 1995 ) .",
    "is weak equilibrium among @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 quarks possible , instead of simply that between @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks ?    at the late stage of stellar evolution , normal baryonic matter is intensely compressed by gravity in the core of massive star during supernova .",
    "the fermi energy of electrons are significant in cbm , and it is very essential to cancel the electrons by weak interaction in order to make lower energy state .",
    "there are two ways to kill electrons as shown in fig  [ f1 ] : one is via _ neutronization _",
    ", @xmath117 , where the fundamental degrees of freedom could be nucleons ; the other is through _ strangenization _ , where the degrees of freedom are quarks . while neutronization works for removing electrons , strangenization has both the advantages of minimizing the electron s contribution of kinetic energy and maximizing the flavour number , the later could be related to the flavour symmetry of strong - interaction matter .",
    "these two ways to kill electrons are relevant to the nature of pulsar , to be neutron star or strange star , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "there are many speculations about the nature of pulsar due to unknown non - perturbative qcd at low energy . among different pulsar models , hadron star and hybrid / mixed star",
    "are conventional neutron stars , while quark star and quark - cluster star are strange stars with light flavour symmetry . in hadron star model , quarks are confined in hadrons such as neutron / proton and hyperon , while a quark star is dominated by de - confined free quarks .",
    "a hybrid / mixed star , with quark matter in its cores , is a mixture of hadronic and quark states .",
    "however , a quark - cluster star , in which strong coupling causes individual quarks grouped in clusters , is neither a hadron star nor a quark star . as an analog of neutrons",
    ", quark - clusters are bound states of several quarks , so to this point of view a quark - cluster star is more similar to a _",
    "real _ giant nucleus of self - bound ( not that of landau ) , rather than a `` giant hadron '' which describes traditional quark stars . different models of pulsar s inner structure are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .    , width=377 ]    it is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that conventional neutron stars ( hadron star and hybrid / mixed star ) are gravity - bound , while strange stars ( strange quark star and strange quark - cluster star ) are self - bound on surface by strong force .",
    "this feature difference is very useful to identify observationally . in the neutron star picture ,",
    "the inner and outer cores and the crust keep chemical equilibrium at each boundary , so neutron star is bound by gravity .",
    "the core should have a boundary and is in equilibrium with the ordinary matter because the star has a surface composed of ordinary matter .",
    "there is , however , no clear observational evidence for a neutron star s surface , although most of authors still take it for granted that there should be ordinary matter on surface , and consequently a neutron star has different components from inner to outer parts .",
    "being similar to traditional quark stars , quark - cluster stars have almost the same composition from the center to the surface , and the quark matter surface could be natural for understanding some different observations .",
