    "the low temperature resistivity in good metals is well within the mott - ioffe - regel ( mir ) limit , @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the lattice constant .",
    "however , in a large class of strongly correlated systems like @xmath9-transition metal oxide compounds and most notably in the strange metal regime of doped cuprates ( high @xmath10 superconductors ) at optimal doping the resistivity far exceeds the mir limit  @xcite and hence can not be characterised by diffusive transport of coherent quasi - particle states in the limit of weak scattering .",
    "other signatures of a bad metal include a thermopower of order @xmath11 , the absence of a drude peak in the optical conductivity , and a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the hall constant and thermopower .",
    "@xcite    there have been a range of theoretical attempts to understand the incoherent regime of transport , especially for the strange metal phase of doped cuprates ( high @xmath10 superconductors ) at optimal doping .",
    "recently , there is a string theory based approach to understand transport in the incoherent regime  @xcite .",
    "string theory , originally proposed as a possible theory for quantum gravity , is mathematically consistent but yet has no experimental verification . in the following paragraph we briefly describe how a string theory based approach has been proposed to describe transport in condensed matter systems .    maldacena conjectured  @xcite that the large @xmath12 limit of certain supersymmetric conformal field theory ( cft ) has correspondence to super gravity in anti - de sitter spaces in higher dimension .",
    "this is known as the _ ads / cft correspondence _ or _",
    "gauge / gravity duality_. the most famous example of ads / cft correspondence states that iib string theory in the product space @xmath13 is dual to large @xmath14 limit of @xmath15 supersymmetric @xmath16 yang - mills theory on the four dimensional boundary .",
    "further ads / cft correspondences relate fluid dynamics to event horizon dynamics of a black hole in anti - de sitter space . in the hydrodynamic regime ( long wavelength limit ) of the correspondence , einstein s equations of general relativity reduce to the navier - stokes equation for fluid mechanics .",
    "classical fluids are characterised by transport coefficients such as shear viscosity and diffusion constant . using the ads / cft correspondence kovtun _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the ratio , @xmath17 , of the shear viscosity ( @xmath18 ) and the entropy density ( @xmath19 ) and proposed a lower bound @xmath20 .",
    "such a bound is respected in classical fluids like water , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite , and in experiments on cold degenerate fermi gases in the unitary limit  @xcite .",
    "however , some violations of this bound have been reported @xcite .",
    "inspired by the bound on the viscosity and also using the ads / cft correspondence hartnoll recently proposed  @xcite a lower bound for the diffusion constant , @xmath21 in the incoherent regime of transport in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "but , except near quantum critical point , condensed matter systems are probably neither relativistic nor conformal  @xcite .",
    "so , this proposal needs to be tested against model based calculations .",
    "the temperature dependent diffusion constant , @xmath22 , is related to the temperature dependent conductivity , @xmath23 , through the _ nernst - einstein relation _",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the _ charge compressibility_. for completeness we give a derivation of this relation in the appendix . because of the above relation knowledge of the charge diffusion constant , @xmath22 , may help us to better understand the electrical conductivity , @xmath23 .",
    "experiments on cold degenerate fermi gases in the unitary scattering limit show a quantum limit to the spin diffusion constant  @xcite , @xmath26 .",
    "this bound is also supported by theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "however , experiments on a two - dimensional fermi gas found a value @xmath27 that was more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the proposed bound  @xcite . but spin diffusion in charge neutral systems such as cold atomic gases has no obvious relation to charge diffusion in charged quantum fluids such as strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "for example , in a mott insulator the charge diffusion constant is zero but the spin diffusion constant is non - zero .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that in a bad metallic phase close to the mott insulator that the charge diffusion constant is much smaller than the spin diffusion constant . in the present article",
    "we do a model based calculation of the charge diffusion constant in a hubbard model , and explore the possible existence of a lower bound to the charge diffusion constant and its possible relation to spin diffusion in atomic gases .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the single band hubbard model and its solution under single site dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "we also briefly describe dmft self - consistency using iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) as a solver for the impurity problem arising under single site dmft . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly introduce calculation of transport and thermodynamic quantities under the single site dmft approximation . then in sec .",
    "iv we show our results for a single band hubbard model on the bethe lattice at half - filling .",
    "we find clear violation of hartnoll s proposed bound , even when the bare fermi velocity @xmath3 is replaced by the low - temperature renormalised velocity , @xmath5 . finally , in sec .",
    "v we conclude and briefly consider how relaxing some of our assumptions may modify the results .",
    "we consider the single band hubbard model with nearest neighbor hopping , described by the hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the hopping amplitude @xmath31 is the chemical potential and @xmath32 is coulomb repulsion for a doubly occupied site .",
    "this is probably the simplest model which incorporates nontrivial strong correlation effects . but",
    "this model has an exact solution only in one dimension and study of this model in higher dimension involves various approximations .",
    "static mean field descriptions like the hartree - fock decomposition of the quartic term @xmath33 only shifts the local chemical potential . because of the complete neglect of the quantum fluctuations this approximation does not generate any new energy scale ( e.g. the fermi liquid coherence scale ) which can become relevant at low temperature regions .",
    "however , as in the case of classical mean field theory for the ising model , in the limit of of large dimension , @xmath34 , ( or large connectivity @xmath35 ) the model reduces to an effective single impurity model provided the scaling @xmath36 is made on a @xmath37-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice  @xcite . under this approximation",
    "we neglect all spatial fluctuations yet fully retain quantum dynamics for the single site .",
    "the self - energy @xmath38 only depends on frequency and not wave vector .",
    "this is known as the dynamical mean field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) .",
    "it has been found dmft gives a good description of the mott metal - insulator transition with increasing correlation strength , @xmath32 , and the crossover from a fermi liquid to bad metal with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dmft has been found to give a quantitative description of the temperature dependence of the resistivity  @xcite and the frequency dependent optical conductivity  @xcite for organic charge transfer salts that are described by a two dimensional hubbard model at half - filling  @xcite . combining dmft with electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory",

    "the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 characterise a given site @xmath43 and @xmath44 characterise the effective bath arising from electrons at all other sites . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are effective parameters characterising the dispersion of the bath and its coupling to the local site . @xmath45 and @xmath46 or equivalently the bath green s function , given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 can be calculated self consistently by solving the impurity problem iteratively .",
    "the solution of the impurity problem is the toughest part and usually involves use of numerical methods such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) , or the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) .",
    "we use iterated perturbation theory ( ipt )  @xcite as it is easy to implement , computationally cheap , and captures the essential physics in the parameter regime we are interested in , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the critical value of @xmath32 at which the mott metal - insulator transition occurs . for example",

    "second , there is the issue of how to evaluate the fermi velocity in the dmft approximation , in the limit of infinite dimensionality , @xmath34 . since , @xmath114 appears in the expression for _ transport density of states _ in eq .",

    "the advantage of calculating scaled diffusivity is that it does not depend on universal constants such as @xmath124 or material dependent constants such as the lattice constant , @xmath1 , and the unit cell volume , @xmath125 , and the temperature appears only as a dimensionless scaled quantity .",
    "we now turn to comparison with the proposed bound for the spin diffusion constant . in a similar spirit we use @xmath126 as a generalized definition for inverse mass .",

    "the resistivity is well within the mott - ioffe - regel limit in the entire temperature range up to @xmath135 .",

    "as we increase @xmath32 , the resistivity smoothly crosses the mott - ioffe - regel limit and in the strongly correlated regime ( @xmath174 and above ) the resistivity far exceeds the mir limit .",
    "this is due to the sharp crossover from the strong coupling ( fermi liquid ) regime to the local moment ( bad metal ) regime in the strong correlation regime and is consistent with the picture of fragile quasi - particles states in the strong correlation regime .    in elemental crystals",
    "one can distinguish metals and insulators by the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",

    "for example , a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity in a bad metal is seen experimentally in a number of organic charge salts .",
    "( see for example the inset of figure 2(a ) of ref . ) .",
    "thus it is important to note that even though the derivative @xmath175 changes sign for some curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistivityvstfnu ] there is no metal - insulator transition , i.e. all the curves are for the metallic phase .",

    "[ fig : scaleddiffusivityhartnoll ] we show the scaled diffusivity , @xmath179 , as a function of temperature ( @xmath4 ) for various correlation strengths ( @xmath32 ) . in the weakly correlated regime ( @xmath137 ) and moderately correlated regime ( @xmath150 and @xmath180 ) the scaled diffusivity satisfies hartnoll s bound . however in the strongly correlated regime , @xmath174 and above , the scaled diffusivity shows violation of hartnoll s bound in the low temperature region .",
    "but at high temperatures @xmath152 the scaled diffusivity satisfies hartnoll s bound .",
    "it is important to mention that the kink like behaviour at around @xmath181 for @xmath147 is closely related to the sharp crossover between the fermi liquid fixed point and the local moment fixed point in the effective single impurity anderson model . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : scaleddiffusivityhartnoll ] the violation of hartnoll s bound in strongly correlated systems is in the crossover region between coherent ( fermi liquid ) regime and incoherent ( local moment ) regime . the magnitude of violation increases with increasing @xmath32 due to increased sharpness in crossover region .",
    "in the high temperature region , where the resistivity is roughly linear in @xmath4 the scaled diffusivity is well above the hartnoll s bound , provided one uses the renormalised fermi velocity .    finally , we compare the charge diffusivity to the quantum limit of the spin diffusion constant , @xmath182 , experimentally observed  @xcite and theoretically calculated  @xcite in the degenerate fermi gas in the unitary limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaleddiffusivityatomic ] we show the scaled diffusivity , @xmath183 , as a function of temperature for various @xmath32 .",
    "the scaled diffusivity also violates the quantum limit of spin diffusion constant , @xmath184 .",
    "the violation is severe in the strongly correlated regime .",
    "all the temperature dependence is ultimately due to inherent temperature dependence of self energy , @xmath38 .",
    "it is important to mention that spin diffusion in charge neutral systems like the degenerate fermi gas in the unitary limit has no clear relation to charge diffusion in electron liquids . in charged systems",
    "there are dynamical screening effects while such screening effects are not present in neutral atomic gases such as the strongly interacting degenerate fermi gas at feshbach resonance .",
    "most interestingly in a mott insulator the charge diffusion constant is zero while the spin diffusion constant is finite .",
    "the differences illustrate different mechanisms for charge and spin transport in strongly correlated systems and one should not necessarily expect any simple relationship between the spin and charge diffusion constants .    for a degenerate non - interacting fermi gas in three dimensions",
    "the charge diffusion constant is given by @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the fermi wave vector and @xmath187 is the mean free path .",
    "in the weak scattering limit @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "so , just like the upper limit ( mir ) of resistivity we can define lower limit for the charge diffusion constant @xmath190 . in the weakly interacting quasi - particle regime of transport",
    "the limit will be renormalized to @xmath191 .",
    "the quantum spin diffusion limit in degenerate fermi gas will roughly correspond to @xmath192 for charge diffusion in a condensed matter system and the diffusion will correspond to transport through coherent quasi - particle states .",
    "we have studied the conductivity , charge compressibility , and charge diffusivity in a single band hubbard model using single site dynamical mean field theory .",
    "the calculated resistivity far exceeds the mir limit in the strong correlation regime .",
    "the transport in the weakly correlated region can be characterized by diffusive scattering of coherent quasi - particle states but in the strongly correlated bad metal state the transport is incoherent .",
    "the charge compressibility decreases with increasing @xmath32 which corresponds to the fact that in the correlated regime , the energy cost to create a charge fluctuation increases with increasing @xmath32 . then using the nernst - einstein relation we calculated the charge diffusivity in the system . in the weakly and moderately correlated systems",
    "the scaled diffusivity respects hartnoll s bound at all temperatures .",
    "however , in the strongly correlated systems the bound is violated in the crossover region between the coherent fermi liquid regime and incoherent local moment regime . in the high temperature region ( @xmath152 ) particularly in the region where resistivity is roughly linear in @xmath4 the bound is found to be respected for all interaction strengths .",
    "we also compared the calculated charge diffusivity against the quantum limit of spin diffusion observed in the degenerate fermi gas in the unitary limit .",
    "the calculated diffusivity strongly violates the quantum limit of spin diffusion in the incoherent regime .",
    "so , within the single site dmft approximation we do not observe any quantum limit to charge diffusion in the strongly correlated incoherent regime .",
    "hartnoll s proposed bound is based on the ads / cft correspondence and various conservation laws in fluids .",
    "but within single site dmft approximation there is energy conservation but no momentum conservation at a given site . on the other hand",
    ", the spatial fluctuations neglected in single site dmft can be systematically incorporated through other approximations such the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite in which momentum is conserved within the cluster , bath as well as at the boundary of the cluster should be able to address this issue",
    ". one might also consider how vertex corrections could modify the results .",
    "for a doped hubbard model it was found in a 4 site dca calculation that the vertex corrections to the optical conductivity were not significant , except very close to the mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "a study of the doped two - dimensional hubbard model using a two - particle self - consistent approach found that vertex corrections altered the calculated resistivity by less than a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "as has been pointed out @xcite the interacting many electron system in strongly correlated materials so far has no gravity description and hence the strongly coupled gauge theory has no dual description . to be more precise , holographic quantum systems associated with known gravity descriptions have no direct relation with strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "furthermore , the ads / cft correspondence only describes conformally invariant field theories and except for one dimensional systems at a quantum critical point , it is not clear that strongly correlated electron systems are conformally invariant  @xcite .",
