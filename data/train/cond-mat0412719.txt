    "water has been studied extensively because it is a fundamental liquid with unique properties . for example , its boiling point under atmospheric pressure , 100@xmath0c , is unusually high for its molecular weight , 18 .",
    "in addition , its volume decreases as it melts , unlike other liquids .",
    "moreover , it has an anomalous density maximum at 4@xmath0c .",
    "these characteristics have been studied in detail using various methods .",
    "consequently , many models have been suggested .",
    "nevertheless , no definite mechanism has been established to explain these anomalous behaviors of water , even though each model can explain some specific phenomena .    one sensitive method to investigate molecular states in solid and liquid forms",
    "is the positron annihilation lifetime ( palt ) method .",
    "when positrons are injected into a liquid , some of them form positroniums with the surrounding electrons .",
    "the positronium lifetime is determined by the rate of annihilation between the positron in the positronium and surrounding electrons , also known as pick - off . as described later , according to the ps - bubble model @xcite , the lifetime should be longer at higher temperatures in liquid water .",
    "however , vrtes @xmath3 @xcite showed that the positronium lifetime has a general decreasing trend for higher temperature , although it oscillates between 38@xmath0c  to 60@xmath0c .",
    "we measured palt in liquid water between 0@xmath0c   and 50@xmath0c .",
    "this paper explains that the positron lifetime decreases smoothly as the temperature rises .",
    "this behavior is explainable by combining the ps - bubble model and a two - state mixture model of water .",
    "this section explains palt and the ps - bubble model .",
    "positrons injected in material can undergo three different processes , each with a different lifetime .",
    "the shortest lifetime ( @xmath4 ) occurs by a formation and annihilation of @xmath5-positronium ( @xmath6-ps ) in which the spins are anti - parallel .",
    "in that situation , the electron forming @xmath6-ps with the positron is captured from the surrounding molecules .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath6-ps in vacuum , @xmath7 0.1 ns , is too short to be affected by surrounding matter .",
    "the second lifetime ( @xmath8 ) is caused by positron annihilation without forming a bound state .",
    "the third lifetime ( @xmath9 ) results from formation of an @xmath1-positronium ( @xmath2-ps ) with parallel spins .",
    "the @xmath2-ps has an intrinsic lifetime of 142 ns in vacuum .",
    "however , in material , the lifetime is typically several nanoseconds because it annihilates with an electron in the surrounding molecules . as a result of this pick - off process",
    ", @xmath9 is sensitive to the electron - state of the surrounding substance . in liquid",
    ", @xmath2-ps is generally considered to push out the surrounding molecules and form a ps - bubble .",
    "the wave function of @xmath2-ps exudes from the surface of ps - bubble , which comprises electrons from surrounding substances .",
    "the overlap of @xmath2-ps wave function and an electron wave function of the surroundings determines the pick - off rate . in the ps - bubble model",
    ", the wave function of @xmath2-ps is trapped inside a spherical infinite - depth well potential whose radius is the sum of the radius of the ps - bubble and the exuding depth .",
    "therefore , @xmath9  is a function of the ps - bubble radius @xcite .",
    "nakanishi @xmath3 introduced a semi - empirical correlation between @xmath9 and the ps - bubble radius @xcite as : @xmath10^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath9  is measured in nanoseconds , @xmath11 is the ps - bubble radius , and @xmath12 is the exuding depth of the @xmath2-ps wave function into the surrounding electron wave functions . in this model , @xmath11 is determined by the balance between the zero - point energy of @xmath2-ps and the surface tension of the surrounding substance .",
    "the balance is represented as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the zero point energy of @xmath2-ps and @xmath15 is the surface tension of bulk water .",
    "@xmath14 is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electron mass and @xmath18 is the momentum of @xmath2-ps .",
    "for the case of water , @xmath15 decreases as the temperature rises ; thereby the bubble becomes larger . by this argument alone , @xmath9 is longer for higher temperatures .",
    "we employed the positron annihilation lifetime technique using @xmath19na as a positron source .",
    "@xmath19na is put in the sample center .",
    "positrons emitted into the sample are annihilated through the process mentioned in the previous section . when @xmath19na emits a positron",
    ", it simultaneously emits a 1275 kev photon .",
    "when a positron is annihilated with an electron , two 511 kev photons are emitted . in light of those facts , we measured the time difference between the emission of 1275 kev photon and the emission of two 511 kev photons .",
