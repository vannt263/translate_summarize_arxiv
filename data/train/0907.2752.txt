    "the cosmic ray data from akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) @xcite , fly s eye @xcite , hires @xcite and pierre auger @xcite are helping us to understand the physics of the energetic cosmic ray particles coming from the outer space .",
    "the important questions to be addressed are , what are their origin , mechanisms of production , composition and how they propagate through the interstellar medium .",
    "due to the low flux of cosmic rays at ultrahigh energies @xmath0ev large scale detectors have to operate for many years to collect significant amount of signals from the ultrahigh energy universe .",
    "the composition of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays is quite unknown .",
    "so far it has been determined using the hadronic interaction models and extrapolating the values of the particle interaction cross sections measured at low energies to ultrahigh energies .",
    "novel methods of determining the composition of ultra high energy cosmic rays is a topic active research @xcite .",
    "the highest energy cosmic ray event of energy @xmath1ev was detected by fly s eye experiment @xcite .",
    "hires experiment , the upgraded version of fly s eye experiment , studied the highest energy cosmic rays in the energy range of @xmath2ev to over @xmath3ev using the atmospheric fluorescence technique .",
    "they reported the presence of gzk ( greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ) @xcite suppression in the spectrum which is due to the interaction of very high energy cosmic ray protons and nucleons with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) is designed to study cosmic rays with energies more than @xmath4eev . with its two sites in the two hemispheres",
    "this observatory is going to cover the entire sky .",
    "the northern site is going to be built in south east colorado , usa . the southern site located in mendoza , argentina has 1600 water cherenkov surface detector stations covering 3000 @xmath5 and 24 fluorescence telescopes to record air shower cascades produced by cosmic rays .",
    "recently they have published results based on data taken between 1 january 2004 to 31 august 2007 @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray protons of energy more than 57eev are expected to be deflected by only a few degrees due to the galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields during their propagation .",
    "27 events have been detected with energies more than @xmath6eev @xcite .",
    "out of these events 20 correlate with at least one of the 442 agn ( active galactic nuclei ) at distances less than @xmath7mpc .",
    "their results are consistent with a gzk suppression in the cosmic ray spectrum . their correlation studies with extragalactic sources imply that the cosmic ray flux is not isotropic .",
    "either the agn or other astrophysical objects with similar spatial distribution are generating the extreme energy cosmic rays .",
    "two events correlate with radio galaxy cen a within less than @xmath8 and several lie in the vicinity of its radio lobe near the super galactic plane .",
    "15 events can be correlated with seyfert galaxies among the closest agn .",
    "more observational and theoretical investigations are necessary to confirm the sites of extreme energy cosmic ray production . at lower energy the deflection of cosmic ray protons",
    "are expected to be much more . as a result",
    "it is difficult to trace their origin .    inside the cosmic accelerators both protons and neutrons are expected to be present , as the shock accelerated relativistic protons will produce neutrons in various interactions like @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "neutrons have a short lifetime and are not expected to reach the earth from distances of the order of 1 mpc",
    ". however , a small violation in the lorentz invariance ( li ) can lead to the stability of neutrons above a certain energy @xcite .",
    "also , protons become unstable and may decay to neutrons above a certain energy in this case .",
    "the prospect of exploring the possible minute violation in li with energetic gamma ray and cosmic ray data has been studied in great detail by many physicists earlier @xcite . even extremely tiny violations in li can change the physics of cosmic rays drastically @xcite . in the present work we have calculated the expected number of neutron events from the closest radio - galaxy centaurus a ( cen a ) in the eev energy range for different degrees of violation in the li .",
    "it is shown that by comparing the observed event rate with our results it is possible to probe an extremely small value of this violation .",
    "we briefly mention about the formalism of vli used in the present work .",
    "the details are discussed in the original paper @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper assumed different maximum attainable velocities ( mavs ) @xmath11 for different particles .",
    "the dispersion relation of the form @xmath12 describes a particle of type a moving freely in the preferred frame . for the neutron decay ( @xmath13 )",
    "scenario the different mavs for neutron , proton , electron and neutrino are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 respectively . considering @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the speed of light ) and using relativistic kinematics it is shown in @xcite that neutron decay is forbidden above energy @xmath20 , whose expression is given by @xmath21^\\frac{1}{2}ev\\ ] ] similarly protons become unstable ( @xmath22 ) above energy @xmath23 @xmath24^\\frac{1}{2}ev\\ ] ] in the above expressions @xmath25 denotes the extent of vli .",
    "a small vli can give rise to stable neutron events as neutrons do not decay and protons may decay to stable neutrons above energies @xmath20 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "cen a ( ngc 5128 ) is the most promising source for uhecrs detected by pao .",
    "high flux of @xmath26-rays with energy @xmath27 gev have been detected from cen a @xcite .",
    "previously h.e.s.s @xcite experiment detected gamma rays above @xmath28 gev from this source .",
    "the flux had an upper limit of @xmath29 .",
    "this source was also observed earlier by egret @xcite above 100mev . extrapolating the spectrum measured by egret with spectral index 2.4 above 190gev one obtains photon flux comparable to that measured by h.e.s.s .",
    "more observations have been carried out on cen a in the recent past .",
    "h.e.s.s experiment has collected @xmath30-ray data from cen a above @xmath31 gev @xcite .",
    "the data can be fitted with photon index @xmath32 .",
    "fermi gamma ray space telescope has measured the flux @xmath33",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 from this source above 100mev .",
    "it is twice the flux measured by egret @xcite . in the past few years the high energy particle emission from cen",
    "a has been investigated in various papers @xcite . here",
    "we have explored the possibility of probing vli of the order of @xmath37 at eev energy with cen a as a source of cosmic rays .",
    "protons are expected to be shcok accelerated to very high energy inside this radio galaxy .",
    "neutrons can be produced inside the source in proton proton or proton photon interactions .",
    "these particles decay in a short time .",
    "however , a small vli can stop the neutrons from decaying .",
    "the stable neutrons would be detectable by pao or other large scale cosmic ray detectors .",
    "the neutron flux ( number of neutrons @xmath38 ) can be expressed as a power law in energy @xmath39 we have assumed a fraction @xmath40 of the total proton flux is converted to neutron flux inside the source .",
    "these neutrons have energy more than @xmath20 which is determined by the degree of violation @xmath41 in li .",
    "the shock accelerated protons may become unstable above a energy @xmath23 due to vli and give rise to neutrons .",
    "the neutron flux produced in this way is @xmath42    we have used the total integrated exposure @xcite to calculate the number of neutron events expected in pa detector .",
    "the integrated exposure of pao is @xmath43 @xmath5 yr sr during @xmath44 jan 2004 to @xmath45 aug 2007 . for a point source exposure per steradian ( @xmath46 )",
    "has been used where @xmath47 sr . the relative exposure due to",
    "the angle of declination @xmath48 is @xmath49 for cen a. pao has detected @xmath50 events above @xmath51 eev from the direction of cen a. we have normalised the cosmic ray flux from the source using these two events . with different values of cosmic ray spectral index @xmath52 and neutron production efficiency",
    "@xmath40 the expected numbers of neutron events above the threshold energy @xmath20 have been calculated .",
    "the cosmic ray flux is not significantly attenuated during propagation due to interactions of neutrons with the photon background as cen a is only 3.8 mpc away .",
    "charged cosmic ray particles will be deflected in all directions by the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "these magnetic fields are not known to us very well .",
    "one may try to estimate the deflections of cosmic rays assuming the field remains unchanged over a certain length .",
    "the angle of deflection in the galactic magnetic field of strength of the order of a few @xmath53 g with a coherence length of order @xmath54 1 kpc may be expressed as @xmath55 where the total distance traversed @xmath56 is about 20kpc @xcite .",
    "we have assumed @xmath57 g in drawing fig.1 .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation @xmath58 due to intergalactic magnetic field ( @xmath59 ) , coherence length @xmath60 travelling a distance @xmath61 is shown in fig.1 . using the expression given below .",
    "@xmath62 at eev energy the protons will be deflected by large angles as one can see from fig.1 . as a result the proton background ( from all sources including cen a ) to the neutron events from cen a at this energy is expected to be isotropic .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have discussed about a possibility of probing small values of vli at eev energy using large scale cosmic ray detectors .",
    "the two events detected within @xmath8 of cen a have been used to normalise the cosmic ray flux from the direction of cen a. in future if more cosmic ray sources are identified close to us then they can be used to probe vli in the same way .",
    "a large number of neutron events within @xmath63 of the source would be a signature of vli at eev energy .",
