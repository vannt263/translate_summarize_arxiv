    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) contain a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) primary onto which material is transferred from a low - mass ( @xmath2 ) late - type , essentially normal main sequence ( ms ) star ( spectral type @xmath0a - m ) , with longer period systems containing a sub - giant .",
    "there are @xmath0190 luminous ( @xmath3 ergs@xmath4 ) lmxbs known in our galaxy ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2007 ) .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are very similar , but have white dwarf ( wd ) primaries at a @xmath5 factor reduction in luminosity and have orbital periods that range from hours to @xmath6 d. while the flux from lmxbs is predominantly in x - rays which originate from the inner accretion disc and the ns surface ( where applicable ) , the flux from cvs is predominantly in the optical and originates from the entire accretion disc , the hot spot(s ) on the wd surface and the disc - mass - transfer stream impact region .",
    "( for details see e.g. frank , king & raine 1992 ) .    long - term , non - orbital , quasi - periodic variations on timescales of @xmath0tens - hundreds of days in lmxbs were discovered early in x - ray astronomy ( see charles et al .",
    "2008 for a recent review ) .",
    "these `` super - orbital '' periods are thought to be related to the properties of the accretion disc , and there are two basic mechanisms actively under consideration : radiation - induced warping ( ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) and precession ( whitehurst & king 1991 ) of the accretion disc .",
    "radiation pressure from the intense x - rays arising near the compact object causes the warping of the accretion disc , while tidal forces in high mass - ratio binaries lead to the precession of the accretion disc ( an effect first observed in cvs , see e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "either of these effects can lead to the periodic obscuration of the compact object in x - ray binaries , causing a super - orbital modulation in the x - ray flux ( clarkson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the stability criteria established by ogilvie & dubus ( 2001 ) suggest that this effect should not arise in most lmxbs , however it is observed , for example , in the long - period lmxb cygx-2 ( clarkson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the presence of even longer - term quasi - periodic variations ( on the order of decades ) has been predicted in cvs as a consequence of the modulation in the mass transfer - rate due to a solar - type magnetic - activity cycle occurring in the donor star ( applegate & patterson 1987 , warner 1988 ) .",
    "the donor stars in short - period lmxbs and cvs are tidally locked and therefore rotate at the orbital period of the binary system , which is @xmath7 d for most systems .",
    "this rapid rotation is expected to generate much stronger magnetic fields ( schrijver & zwaan 1992 ) .",
    "long - term variability changes in the surface activity of stars ( such as starspot activity ) have been detected on timescales of decades ( baliunas 1985 ) , similar to the @xmath011 yr magnetic - activity cycle of our sun .",
    "applegate ( 1992 ) suggested that magnetically active donors become more oblate as their outer layers are spun up , due to angular momentum distribution changes brought about by their magnetic activity . as a result , the volume of the roche lobe changes during the magnetic cycle , while the volume of the donor remains unchanged .",
    "the magnetic activity cycle therefore governs the roche - lobe volume and the structure of the donor , which will be varying in oblateness as the cycle progresses .",
    "such a variation will modulate the amount by which the donor overfills the roche lobe and therefore the mass transfer rate will also vary on the magnetic - activity time - scale ( as discussed by richman , applegate & patterson 1994 for cvs , hereafter r94 ) .",
    "considering the similarities between lmxbs and cvs , it is not unreasonable to expect similar longer - term modulations in lmxbs for the same reason . online archival datasets now allow for a detailed investigation of long - term variations in the lightcurves of x - ray sources . here",
    "we report on an analysis of the @xmath013-year x - ray history of lmxbs contained in the rxte / asm datasets .    shortly before completing this paper , we became aware of durant et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "while they mention similar long - term timescales of the x - ray flux modulations in the 16 brightest persistent lmxbs contained in the rxte asm datasets , we propose here a mechanism which would explain the observed dichotomy between atoll and z sources , and for the origin of these long time - scales .",
    "the all sky monitor ( asm ) aboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) is provided and operated by the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) .",
    "the asm has observed the x - ray sky since early 1996 by scanning approximately 80% of the sky during each orbit of the satellite , providing monitoring of a source every @xmath090 minutes for at least 90 seconds .",
    "the asm contains three rotating scanning shadow cameras ( ssc ) , allowing positional measurement of previously unknown sources to within 3 arcmin precision and providing individual monitoring sessions , which are referred to as `` dwells '' .",
    "data are available in four energy bands : 1.5 - 3 kev ( a ) , 3 - 5 kev ( b ) , 5 - 12 kev ( c ) and a sum - band 1.5 - 12 kev ( a+b+c ) .",
    "data for each energy band are reduced independently by taking background effects into account and made available as dwell - by - dwell or one - day - averages .",
    "data are reduced and compiled weekly by the asm team and made publically available . for full details",
    "see levine et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the asm monitoring began on 20 february 1996 , and for this paper we were able to employ datasets spanning more than 13 years .",
    "therefore these archival datasets contain the long - term intensity history of all x - ray sources in the rxte catalogue . the fact that rxte is sensitive in the soft x - ray regime ( 2 - 10 kev ) is particularly useful for the studies of lmxbs , since their largest flux contribution comes from soft x - rays .",
    "the full asm lightcurves of all 44 significantly detected lmxbs ( average flux @xmath8 0.5 counts s@xmath4 ) were considered for further analysis .",
    "transients were excluded ( aql x-1 , groj1655 - 40 , gx339 - 4 , h1743 - 322 , 4u1543 - 47 , 4u1608 - 52 , 4u1630 - 47 , xtej1550 - 564 , xtej1701 - 462 and xtej1859 + 226 ) , since their outburst(s ) are the only reason these sources were detected above the @xmath9 level .",
    "4u1820 - 30 was excluded , since it is almost certainly a triple system ( chou & grindlay 2001 ) , which would have additional dynamics compared to the other lmxbs and is therefore not relevant in our analysis here .",
    "cir x-1 was also excluded , since its highly eccentric orbit ( murdin et al .",
    "1980 ) will introduce large phase - dependent changes in the donor s roche lobe .",
    "asm one - day - average sum - band lightcurve data were plotted on scales appropriate for showing long - term behaviour , and from visual inspection of those lightcurves , it became apparent that some sources display large amplitude , very long - term modulations that appear periodic or quasi - periodic in nature .",
    "they are : gx3 + 1 , gx9 + 1 , gx9 + 9 , gx354 - 0 , 4u1636 - 536 , 4u1708 - 40 , 4u1735 - 444 , 4u1746 - 37 and serx-1 .",
    "these are all classified as atoll sources , with the exception of the x - ray burster 4u1708 - 40 .",
    "re - examining all the atoll sources , there appear to be very long - term modulations in all of them , although to a lesser extent than those sources listed above .",
    "furthermore , all the z sources display remarkably steady lightcurves over the long - term .    for the plots , the liu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) classifications for lmxbs were added in square brackets ( see the caption of fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] for a description of these classifications ) .",
    "our subsequent analysis focussed on the z and atoll sources , since they appear to represent the two extremes in long - term periodic behaviour .",
    "therefore , the remaining sources ( 4u1254 - 69 [ b , d,(sb ) ] , 4u1556 - 60 , 4u1624 - 49 [ d ] , her x-1 [ p , d , e ] , 4u1708 - 40 [ b ] , mxb1730 - 335 [ t , g , b , d , r ] , ks1731 - 260 [ t , b,(sb ) ] , 4u1822 - 000 , 2a1822 - 371 [ p , e ] , gs1826 - 238 [ t , b ] , grs1915 + 105 [ t , d , m , r ] , 4u1957 + 11 [ u ] ) were not considered further .",
    "the variability analysis was conducted on asm dwell - by - dwell data , which were rebinned into 10-day bins , using the prescribed filters@xmath10 for constructing asm averages .",
    "these are : @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for scox-1 ) , number of sources in the field of view @xmath13 , earth angle @xmath14 , exposure time @xmath15 seconds , long - axis angle : @xmath16@xmath17 , short - axis angle : @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "additional filters applied are : background counts @xmath20 , hardness ratio : @xmath21 , flux error @xmath22 , number of datapoints per bin @xmath23 to give the most reliable dataset .",
    "we include data up to 13 august 2009 ( @xmath24 mjd @xmath25 ) .",
    "since the long - term modulations displayed in these lightcurves have timescales that exceed or are comparable to the observational baseline , we can not make use of the usual period analysis tools such as periodograms . in order to estimate the time - scale of these long - term variations ,",
    "single sine - waves were fitted to all the atoll sources . in the case of gx9 + 9 a linear term",
    "was added ( cf .",
    "harris et al .",
    "2009 , who also noted the presence of the @xmath0 1500 d modulation ) .",
    "the results for the 8 atoll sources which display the most significant long - term modulations , are contained in table [ comparea1 ] ( and their lightcurves in fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] ) .",
    "the results for the remaining atoll sources are included in table [ comparea2 ] ( and fig .",
    "[ lc2 ] ) .",
    "although the z sources appear to display remarkably steady lightcurves over the long - term , they can also be fitted with single sine - waves , but with much lower amplitudes .",
    "the results of their fits are contained in table [ comparez ] and fig .",
    "[ lc3 ] .",
    ".asm properties of the 8 significantly modulating atoll sources [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     uncertainties in the values obtained are included in the tables in parentheses .",
    "the binned data flux errors were adjusted by a factor , so as to obtain fits for which @xmath26 .",
    "this gives more sensible errors on the sine - wave parameters , since the errorbars for the binned data are extremely small in comparison to the larger flux variations ( which dominate ) .",
    "the factors applied , to the sources that show the largest scale systematic variations , were : 43.4 for cyg x-2 , 36.8 for 4u 1705 - 44 and 32.9 for sco x-1 .",
    "the factors applied to the rest of the sources range from 1.5 - 14.7 , which are comparable to the factor of 3.1 required for a constant fit to the crab .",
    "the f - statistic was calculated for the 2 models of a constant fit and a single sine - wave fit to the data . for gx9 + 9",
    "the simpler model considered was a linear variation with time .",
    "the calculated f - values are included in tables [ comparea1 ] , [ comparea2 ] & [ comparez ] .",
    "f - values @xmath27 are obtained , indicating that the inclusion of additional terms ( the sine wave ) is highly significant ( @xmath28 confidence ) .",
    "the f - values are highest in those sources where we could detect long - term variation by simple visual inspection .",
    "even the lowest f - values determined @xmath29 are still highly significant , indicating that all the sources considered here were better fitted with a single sine - wave than with a constant value .",
    "flux modulations of @xmath30 of the average flux values are present in the atoll sources , with the exception of the superburster 4u1636 - 536 and the burster gx13 + 1 .",
    "it is possible that the modulation detected in 4u1636 - 536 represents a superburst , rather than the long - term modulations we consider to be present in the other sources ( which may also be the case for ks1731 - 260 ) .",
    "gx13 + 1 is classified as an atoll source , but it shares certain properties with z sources ( liu et al .",
    "indeed , we find that its amplitude for the very long - term modulation rather agrees with those found in the z sources , than with those obtained for the atoll sources .",
    "flux modulations are @xmath3113% for the z sources , with the brighter sources having the lower amplitudes .",
    "both atoll and z sources contain ns primaries , but z sources have fluxes that are @xmath00.5 - 1@xmath32 , whereas atoll sources and bursters have fluxes @xmath00.01 - 0.5@xmath32 ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "once at the eddington limit ( @xmath32 ) , z sources are unlikely to show any x - ray flux modulation due to additional changes in the mass transfer rate .",
    "however , atoll sources would be expected to modulate their flux in response to overall changes in the mass transfer rate .",
    "the results show that , in general , atoll sources have larger amplitude in the very long - term modulations than z sources , which occur on very long - term timescales in both types .      a mechanism for modulating the mass transfer rate over long timescales has been proposed for cvs ( applegate & patterson 1987 , warner 1988 ) .",
    "given the similarities between cvs and lmxbs , we decided to investigate whether this mechanism might also be applicable to lmxbs .",
    "our current x - ray observational baseline for lmxbs is too short to cover multiple cycles and thereby establish the stability of these variations . however , given the similarity of these timescales to those exhibited by solar - type stars , we use the approach of r94 for cvs , and see if it is also applicable to lmxbs .",
    "the mechanism proposed in r94 to be responsible for long - term variations in cvs is due to magnetic activity cycles in the donors .",
    "they calculate the variation in the mass transfer rate ( @xmath33 ) which is associated with the observed orbital period variation ( @xmath34 ) brought about by this mechanism in cvs .",
    "r94 proposed that changes in the rotation of a thin outer shell ( mass @xmath35 ) of the donor ( mass @xmath36 ) , rotating with angular velocity ( @xmath37 ) , will affect the orbital period .",
    "they calculate that : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "they noted that the applegate ( 1992 ) variable differential rotation rates follow the hall ( 1990 ) and hall ( 1991 ) differential rotation - orbital period relation , and consequently applied that relation to the orbital periods for cvs to obtain @xmath40 .",
    "they furthermore assume that @xmath41 and calculate a @xmath33 which is consistent with the observed long - term flux variations in cvs , but consider the observed @xmath34 to be the best evidence for long - term cycles with a preferred timescale of decades ( 5 - 30 yrs ) , reminiscent of solar - like magnetic cycles ( warner 1988 ) .",
    "they also find that cvs show quasi - periodic brightness fluctuations over that timescale .",
    "we apply equation ( 1 ) to the lmxb gx9 + 9 , which has @xmath42 hrs ( kong et al .",
    "2006 ) , and for which @xmath43 has been found spectroscopically by cornelisse et al .",
    "we consequently obtain @xmath44 .",
    "cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found no significant change in orbital period over the @xmath011 yr rxte / asm baseline .",
    "considering the result for @xmath34 , we would not expect to detect a change in the orbital period in the rxte / asm dwell - by - dwell data , since the @xmath45 implied is @xmath0 60 times smaller than the error in @xmath1 .",
    "such a change in p will cause a corresponding change in the size of the donor s roche lobe ( @xmath46 ) and therefore modulate the mass transfer rate @xmath47 by an amount determined by r94 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the photospheric scale - height of a main sequence donor .",
    "assuming the standard paczyski ( 1971 ) relation for the size of the donor s roche lobe gives @xmath50 and if the donor in gx9 + 9 also follows the cv secondary relation of @xmath51 , then @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( see r94 ) .",
    "therefore a maximum flux modulation of @xmath54 is expected by virtue of the orbital period variation and we actually observe @xmath0 8 @xmath55 over a period @xmath56 yrs .",
    "in fact , this result regarding the expected maximum flux modulation will apply to all the lmxbs mentioned in this paper , for the whole range of long - term periods determined from the fitted sine - waves .",
    "the flux modulations determined from the fitted sine - waves for the sources considered are @xmath57 .",
    "it is therefore quite plausible that the long - term modulations observed in the rxte asm lightcurves of the lmxbs , originate from magnetic activity cycles in the donor , just as has been proposed for cvs .",
    "long - term variation in the mass transfer rate due to the magnetic activity cycle of the donor , should therefore translate into long - term quasi - periodic modulations of the x - ray flux for sources in which the additional material can be accreted onto the ns without violating the eddington limit , such as atoll sources and bursters .",
    "however , in z sources very little ( if any ) of the additional material will be accreted and much lower amplitude ( if any ) long - term x - ray flux modulations are expected as a result of the magnetic activity cycle of the donor .    therefore , we conclude that rxte asm lightcurve data may now provide the first evidence for very long - term quasi - periodic modulations of the x - ray flux as a result of the modulation in the mass transfer - rate due to a solar - type magnetic - activity cycle in the donor star , similar to those proposed for cvs .",
    "asm results were provided by the asm / rxte teams at mit and at the rxte science operations facility and guest observer facility at nasa s goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
