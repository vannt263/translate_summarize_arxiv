    "the famous courant s theorem @xcite about nodal domains of eigenfunctions of differential operators states that    [ couthm ] let @xmath3 be a self - adjoint second order elliptic operator on a domain @xmath4 with arbitrary boundary conditions .",
    "if its eigenfunctions are ordered according to increasing eigenvalues , then the nodes of the @xmath2-th eigenfunction @xmath5 divide the domain into no more than @xmath2 subdomains .",
    "the subdomains defined in the theorem are called nodal domains and are the connected components of the complement of the nodal set @xmath6 , which are separated by the nodes , or zeros , of eigenfunctions of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a schrdinger operator on @xmath7\\subset { \\mathbb r}$ ] , that is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the laplacian and @xmath10 some potential , courant s theorem becomes : _ the nodes of the @xmath2-th eigenfunction @xmath5 divide @xmath4 into exactly n nodal domains_. besides , the zeros of eigenfunctions of @xmath3 have an interlacing property : _ between two zeros of @xmath5 , there is exactly one zero of @xmath11 . _",
    "analogues of courant s result on graph have recently received increasing attention , see for example @xcite and the recent book @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors davies _",
    "_ prove an analogue of courant s theorem on graph .",
    "contrary to the situation when @xmath4 is a manifold , since a function on a graph is only defined on the set of vertices , an eigenfunction can change its sign without passing through zero , hence the nodes are not well defined .",
    "so , davies _",
    "_ introduce the notion of sign graph , which is a connected set of vertices , on which the eigenvector has the same sign , and prove the analogue of courant s result , about the maximal number of sign graphs of eigenvectors of a schrdinger operator .",
    "their proof are based on courant s minimax theorem , see @xcite , and some straightforward algebra . in @xcite",
    ", biyikolu proves an analogue of courant s theorem for trees : he characterises the maximal number of sign graphs of an eigenvector of a generalised laplacian , and gives a computational algorithm to find an eigenvector with minimum number of sign graphs . in particular",
    ", he proves that if @xmath12 is an eigenvector associated to the @xmath2-th ordered eigenvalue @xmath13 without a vanishing coordinate , then @xmath12 has exactly @xmath2 sign graphs",
    ". he also characterises the maximal number of sign graphs for eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than one .    here , we will prove the analogue of courant s result for schrdinger operator on finite trees , under the assumption that all the eigenvalues are simple .",
    "this recover the previous result of biyikolu @xcite for simple eigenvalues .",
    "we will also prove the analogue of the interlacing property of eigenfunctions .",
    "since on a tree there is a unique path connecting two vertices , we can extend a function by linearity on edges , which allows us to define the zeros of an eigenfunction .",
    "the situation becomes then very similar to what happens in the real unidimensional case .",
    "both proof of courant s nodal theorem and of the interlacing property of eigenfunctions of a schrdinger operator on a tree follow the lines of the proof of courant @xcite , which is based on green s formula .",
    "let @xmath14 be a finite tree , where @xmath10 is the set of vertices and @xmath15 the set of edges , with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles .",
    "this means that on a tree , any two points ( possibly on the edges ) are connected by a unique path .",
    "we note for @xmath18 , @xmath19 if there is an edge connecting @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are said to be neighbours , or adjacent .",
    "we choose some vertex @xmath22 with only one neighbour and call it the root of the tree .",
    "this gives an orientation of the edges , the positive orientation being the direction connecting the root @xmath22 and the vertices .",
    "we note @xmath23 the edge starting from @xmath20 and ending at @xmath21 .",
    "we consider weighted trees , that is there is a function @xmath24 such that @xmath25 let for @xmath19 , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is called the length of the edge connecting @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "we define the derivative operator @xmath37 by @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "its adjoint @xmath40 is then given by @xmath41 , for @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath9 is called the _",
    "laplacian _ on @xmath0 , and for @xmath44 , we have for all @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath9 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath28 .",
    "if we see @xmath32 as a vector in @xmath47 , then @xmath9 can be seen as a @xmath48 symmetric matrix whose entries are given by @xmath49 we can also introduce the notion of schrdinger operator . let @xmath50 be some function on @xmath10 , which plays the rle of some potential . define @xmath51 .",

    "suppose @xmath13 is of multiplicity @xmath67",
    ". then any eigenvector corresponding to @xmath13 has at most @xmath68 strong sign graphs .    for our context of schrdinger operators",
    ", we will make the    the eigenvalues of @xmath53 are all simple , i.e. @xmath69 .    the theorem of davies _",
    "_ becomes then : @xmath13 has at most @xmath2 strong sign graphs .",
    "we make this assumption because there exists some examples of eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues @xmath13 of multiplicity",
    "greater than one , which have more than @xmath2 strong sign graphs .",
    "for example , this counterexample is taken from @xcite .",
    "consider the tree which is a star with four edges .",
    "let the weight @xmath70 equal one for all edges , and look at the laplacian @xmath9 .",
    "its eigenvalues are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , so @xmath74 has multiplicity @xmath75 .",
    "an eigenvector associated with @xmath74 is @xmath76 , hence @xmath77 has @xmath75 @xmath78 strong sign graphs , see figure  [ star ] .",
    "let @xmath12 be a function on @xmath10 , and @xmath79 its linear extension on edges .",
    "a nodal domain of @xmath79 is a maximal connected path on which @xmath79 is of constant sign .",
    "since a tree is connected , this notion is well defined .",
    "the different nodal domains of @xmath79 are then separated by the zeros of @xmath79 .",
    "a nodal domain of @xmath79 can also be seen as a subtree of @xmath0 with some incomplete edges .",
    "let @xmath4 be a strong sign graph of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath23 be an edge with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "this implies that @xmath79 must vanish on the interval @xmath830,l(x , y)]$ ] .",
    "hence , @xmath4 defines uniquely a nodal domain @xmath84 of @xmath79 , because , since @xmath79 is linear on any edge , we can not have two zeros on the same edge , and a nodal domain contains at least one vertex .",
    "so , a function @xmath12 having @xmath2 strong sign graphs is equivalent to @xmath79 having @xmath2 nodal domains .",
    "we end this section by looking at zero vertices of eigenvectors .",
    "let @xmath12 be an eigenvector of @xmath53 with eigenvalue @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a zero vertex of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "then , @xmath87 , and we have @xmath88 since @xmath89 for all @xmath19 , two cases are possible : we have either @xmath90 for all @xmath91 , and @xmath20 is said to belong to a zero graph , or @xmath20 is adjacent to both strict signs .",
    "we remark that a nodal domain of @xmath79 can not end at endpoints of the tree , or else an endpoint @xmath20 would be a zero vertex and the unique neighbour of @xmath20 would be of strict sign , which is not possible by what we have seen above .",
    "since @xmath92 on a zero graph , we identify a zero graph as a unique zero of @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath12 be some function on @xmath10 .",
    "the set @xmath93 is a forest , that is , a disjoint union of trees .",
    "let @xmath4 be one of this trees .",
    "then @xmath4 is a strong positive sign graph of @xmath12 , so @xmath4 determines a nodal domain @xmath84 of @xmath79 .",
    "let us introduce some boundary sets : @xmath94 since @xmath64 for all @xmath80 , we have @xmath95 for all @xmath96 , otherwise @xmath21 would be in @xmath4 .",

    "we have @xmath99 the boundary of @xmath84 ( depending on @xmath12 ) is then defined by @xmath100 this boundary set is defined in the same way for @xmath4 a strong negative sign graph .",

    "we have the analogue of the green s formula ,    let @xmath51 be a schrdinger operator .",
    "let @xmath30 be functions on @xmath10 , and @xmath103 their linear extension on edges .",

    "since @xmath101 is the usual derivate , we have @xmath113 for @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "hence , we have @xmath115 so the proposition is proved .",
    "as in the classical result of courant , we can now prove the nodal theorem and the interlacing property of the zeros of eigenvectors of @xmath53 .",

    "suppose that @xmath123 does not change sign on @xmath84 , and say @xmath124 on @xmath84 .",
    "this implies that @xmath125 , for all @xmath80 . by green s formula",
    ", we have @xmath126 the left hand side of the above expression is then negative .",
    "since @xmath127 on the edges @xmath128 , and @xmath124 on @xmath84 , then the right hand side is non - negative .",
    "so there is a contradiction , and @xmath123 must vanish and change sign on @xmath84 . using the same argument on all of the strong sign graphs of @xmath12 , we conclude that @xmath123 has at least one more nodal domain than @xmath79 . by the theorem of davies _",
    ", if all eigenvalues @xmath13 of @xmath53 are simple , then @xmath5 has at most @xmath2 strong sign graphs , and hence @xmath117 has at most @xmath2 nodal domains .",
    "so , we deduce from this by iteration , that @xmath117 has exactly @xmath2 nodal domains , and hence @xmath5 has exactly @xmath2 strong sign graphs . indeed , since @xmath129 is chosen everywhere positive , it has only one strong sign graph . since @xmath130 must vanish and change sign on it , two cases can occur .",
