    "in recent years the off - equilibrium properties of extended systems have represented a very active field of research .",
    "in fact , while the present understanding of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium is rather satisfactory and is based on well established theoretical methods , the comprehension of their dynamical aspects is far from complete , in spite of massive experimental and theoretical investigations @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall focus attention on the density functional method , which represents a powerful and widely used tool to investigate the static properties of many particles systems @xcite and consider the possibility of extending this approach to off - equilibrium situations .",
    "some authors have already employed similar approaches on a purely phenomenological basis by analogy with the popular ginzburg - landau time dependent equation and the cahn - hilliard equation , but these methods are not applicable to the highly structured density profiles that one observes at the onset of crystallization .",
    "the density functional ( df ) formalism , with advanced models for the non - local functional dependence of the helmholtz free energy on the density distribution , has provided a good framework to study the solid - liquid transition and other highly structured systems .",
    "there have been previous attempts to derive a dynamic density functional ( ddf ) theory from the microscopic equations of motions @xcite- @xcite , so that the density functional approximations developed for systems at equilibrium might be extended to the dynamics of these systems .",
    "however , none of these proposals is fully satisfactory as we shall demonstrate , while the derivation that we consider makes direct contact with the equilibrium df formulation and is therefore consistent with thermodynamic requirements .    the theoretical foundations of the density functional methods are based on the concept that the intrinsic helmholtz free energy of a fluid that exhibits a spatially varying equilibrium density @xmath1 , is a unique functional @xmath0 $ ] and is independent of the applied external fields for a given intermolecular potential .",
    "an exact knowledge of @xmath0 $ ] allows obtaining in a self - consistent fashion the profile @xmath1 and all the n - point correlations via functional differentiation . when dealing with non - equilibrium situations , caused by some changes of the external constraints , such as the temperature , the pressure , or electric field",
    ", it would be extremely useful to have similar methods at our disposal .",
    "mode coupling theories @xcite provide a kinetic approach to the dynamic of supercooled fluids and structural glass transitions , but fail to predict the crystallization process . in in other cases the phase ordering dynamics of liquids has been based on schematic model hamiltonians of the ginzburg - landau type , which neglect the microscopic structure or on heuristic approximations for the free energy @xcite .    in principle",
    "the density is not the only relevant variable in a dynamical description .",
    "the velocity distribution and correlation are crucial in the understanding of hydrodynamic modes , while they do not appear in the equilibrium df for classical fluids .",
    "however , one could argue following cohen and de schepper @xcite that when the density is large , the momentum and the energy flow quickly through the system via collisions , while the density variable decays slowly .",
    "the hydrodynamic modes should become irrelevant for the dynamics of dense and strongly structured systems ; the only relevant variable should be the density distribution , as in the equilibrium case , and the use of the equilibrium @xmath0 $ ] is a promising starting point to include the effects of the density correlations .    in the present study",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems with such `` relaxational dynamics '' , in which the velocity distribution plays no relevant role . instead of starting directly with the newtonian dynamics of the particles",
    ", we force the irrelevance of the velocity distribution at microscopic level and begin from the stochastic brownian equations of motion of a system of @xmath2 particles interacting via two - body forces . in the equilibrium limit",
    ", as a very long time average of the dynamic evolution , the newtonian and the brownian equations of motion should give the same results and be equal to those of the equilibrium statistical ensemble .",
    "the relaxational dynamics of dense systems has also to be similar for the two types of microscopic dynamics : the rapid flow of momentum and energy due to particle - particle collisions in the newtonian dynamics , is given ( most efficiently ) by the bath in the brownian dynamics .",
    "of course , there are cases ( including some of the examples analyzed in this work ) for which the newtonian and the brownian dynamics have very different results . in those cases our proposed df approach to the dynamics",
    "would still be useful for systems following the brownian equation of motion , like colloidal particles in a bath , but it would not be appropriate for systems in which the microscopic dynamics is newtonian and the velocity distribution becomes relevant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we derive the dynamic density functional theory starting from the stochastic equations of motion of the particles and discuss the main features of the resulting ddf approach . in section 3",
    "we apply the method to few systems of hard molecules in one dimension , for which the exact equilibrium free energy density functional is known ; the comparison between the ddf and the averages over the langevin simulations gives a clear view of the validity of our proposal . in section 4",
    "we explore the same systems but using now approximate forms for @xmath0 $ ] , of the same type as those developed for realistic systems in three dimensions ; in this way we analyze the effects of the approximations used for @xmath0 $ ] , which would be unavoidable in the practical use of the ddf formalism . in 5",
    "we draw the conclusions , discuss previous approaches and present the future perspectives .",
    "one considers an assembly of @xmath2 brownian particles of coordinates @xmath3 interacting via an arbitrary pair potential @xmath4 and experiencing an external field @xmath5 . neglecting the inertial term and the hydrodynamic interaction their motion",
    "can be described by the following set of coupled stochastic equations : @xmath6 + { \\bf\\eta}_i(t ) \\label{eq : uno}\\ ] ] where the term @xmath7 represents the influence of the thermal bath and has the properties : @xmath8 and @xmath9 where the average is over the gaussian noise distribution and @xmath10 run over @xmath11 .",
    "the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 give the mobility and the diffusion coefficient of the particles , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : sette ] ) is a stochastic equation for the total instantaneous density @xmath28 and is not an average , thus it is a sum of @xmath2 spikes located at the positions of the particles at the positions of the particles at time @xmath29 .",
    "the connection with the df formalism was made by dean @xcite in the following terms : the helmholtz free energy density functional , @xmath30= t \\int d { \\bf r } \\rho({\\bf r } ) [ \\log(\\rho({\\bf r } ) ) -1 ] + \\int d r \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\ v_{ext}({\\bf r } ) + \\delta f[\\rho ] , \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] contains the exact ideal gas entropy and the external potential contribution in the first two terms , while the third one includes the effects of interactions and correlations between the particles and its exact form is known only for very few systems .",
    "the first two terms in the bracket of ( [ eq : sette ] ) correspond precisely to the contributions of the ideal gas and the external potential to @xmath31 , and within an implicit mean field approximation it was observed that the third term in the bracket of ( [ eq : sette ] ) can also be cast in terms of the functional derivative of @xmath32 $ ] . in a slightly different language",
    "the analysis by kawasaki @xcite led to the same type of proposal : a dynamic density functional equation for @xmath33 in term of the functional derivative of @xmath0 $ ] and a remaining stochastic contribution , from the noise term in ( [ eq : sette ] ) .",
    "however , the use of the equilibrium functional @xmath0 $ ] only makes sense with an ensemble averaged density distribution .",
    "the delta - function peaks in @xmath33 would give infinite contributions to the first term in ( [ eq : f ] ) , because they correspond to a single microscopic state and not any statistical ensemble average . to make the connection between ( [ eq : sette ] ) and",
    "a density functional description one has to implement some kind of averaging over the instantaneous distribution of particles .    within the microscopic brownian dynamics",
    "the obvious way to proceed is to average over the realizations of the random noise @xmath34 .",
    "we denote by brackets , @xmath35 , the results of this averaging and in particular we define the noise - averaged density @xmath36 . in the equilibrium limit ,",
    "when the system has been allowed to relax for long enough time under the brownian dynamics , this average would correspond precisely to the gibbsian equilibrium average . in the study of the dynamics , out of equilibrium , the density @xmath37 has to be interpreted as an ensemble average , as in a collection of colloidal systems with the colloidal particles at the same initial conditions but with different ( thermalized ) microscopic states for the bath .",
    "we may hope , without demonstration , that this brownian ensemble may also give an accurate description of dense systems with newtonian dynamics near the crystallization , for which the ensemble should be interpreted as a collection of systems with the same initial positions but different ( thermalized ) velocities for the particles .    when we proceed to take the noise average over the brownian evolution equation ( [ eq : sette ] ) the first effect is to cancel out the noise contribution in the last term .",

    "the simplest mean field approximation assumes @xmath45 and gives a closed equation for @xmath43 , but it would give quite pathological results for the molecular core repulsions .",

    "one can get approximated results breaking the chain at any level .",
    "the so called kirkwood superposition approximation , replaces the three - point correlation by a product of two - point correlations as the next step after the mean field approximation and may already give reasonable results for hard core interactions .    here",
    "we propose a different strategy , a density functional approach in which the two - point correlation function may be approximated with the help of equilibrium free energy density functionals .",
    "the excess free energy density functional @xmath32 $ ] in principle contains all the equilibrium correlation structures in the system and , although the exact functional form is known only for very few systems , there are workable and very accurate approximations for most systems of interest .",
    "we may use the information contained in @xmath32 $ ] , about the correlation structure at equilibrium , to approximate @xmath47 in a system out of equilibrium . in this way we get a generic , closed , dynamic density functional relation for @xmath43 equivalent to ( [ eq : dfid ] ) with a clear interpretation of the approximations involved .    let us consider an equilibrium state of the system characterized by an arbitrary profile @xmath48 ( the subscript @xmath49 indicates the equilibrium average ) , which we shall eventually take equal to the profile @xmath43 at a given instant @xmath29 .",

    "however , the trajectories that lead to the minima of @xmath64 are not necessarily along the directions corresponding to the maximum slope .",
    "the continuity equation , implies that the local conservation of particles is built in and imposes important constrains on the local changes of @xmath68 .    for any system with a finite number of particles",
    "there is a unique canonical equilibrium density distribution , @xmath48 , which corresponds to the unique local ( and global ) minimum of the exact free energy density functional @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "however , the use of approximations for @xmath0 $ ] may lead to the existence of several local minima in which the dynamics of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : df],[eq : decrease ] ) may get trapped ; this deserves further comment .",
    "notice first that these local minima of the free energy density functional , and the barriers between them , can not be directly associated to the local minima , and to the barriers , of the potential energy in the langevin description .",
    "consider the dynamics of an ideal brownian gas in an external potential with two local minima , separated by a barrier @xmath72 ; the langevin representation requires the gaussian noise @xmath69 to allow the particles to go over the barrier .",
    "the probability of such a jump is proportional to @xmath73 and , for large barriers , it sets the scale of time for the equilibration of the system .",
    "the same time scale appears in the exact fokker - planck representation ( [ eq : dfid ] ) through a different mechanism : the free energy landscape has a single minimum , at the equilibrium density @xmath74 , there are no free - energy barriers and the deterministic time evolution is set by the particle current ( [ eq : current ] ) along the functional path to equilibrium . when the equilibration requires moving particles across a large potential barrier , the relaxation time is imposed by the density there , @xmath75 , which may produce a very weak current even if the gradient of the local chemical potential is large .",
    "the presence of different local minima in approximate free energy density functionals is often found in the use of the density functional formalism for equilibrium properties .",
    "the usual interpretation is that the global minimum gives the true equilibrium state , while other local minima are associated with metastable states , and phase transitions are described as the crossover of different minima @xcite .",
    "this is a ( generalized ) mean - field level of description , in which the phase transition is described in terms of an order parameter related to the one - particle distribution functions .",
    "the exact description should always give convex thermodynamic potentials and it requires the description of the phase transitions in terms of the n - particle correlations , rather than in terms of a one - particle order parameter .    in the present context , the use of approximate free energy density functionals with more than one local minima poses a problem of interpretation .",
    "when the deterministic time evolution ( [ eq : df ] ) gets trapped at a metastable state it can never reach the true equilibrium state . in previous attempts to use @xmath0 $ ] for dynamics ,",
    "both dean @xcite and kawasaki @xcite have kept an extra random noise term in ( [ eq : df ] ) , as a remnant of the original random noise in the langevin dynamics .",
    "this random noise , allows the system to jump over any metastability barrier in a finite time but it leaves the problem of identifying its origin and intensity . from our analysis",
    "it is clear that the use of the free energy density functional makes sense only for the density @xmath76 , averaged over the realizations of @xmath69 in the langevin dynamics , and this averaging gives the deterministic equation ( [ eq : df ] ) .",
    "we proceed here to explore the results of the deterministic ddf formalism and come back to this point in the conclusion section .",
    "the practical use of ( [ eq : df ] ) to study problems like the growth of a liquid drop from an oversaturated vapour seems to be limited .",
    "the classical lifshitz - slyozov - wagner theory @xcite for the late stages of growth , beyond the critical droplet size , is given directly from ( [ eq : df ] ) , even if we use the simplest local density approximation for @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "however , any available approximations for @xmath0 $ ] , will be unable to describe the early stages of nucleation , as they do not include the effects of long - range critical - like correlations",
    ". however , we now have density functional approximations with a good description of the short range correlation structure in highly packed systems . the df description of the freezing of a liquid @xcite,@xcite or the study of fluids confined to narrow pores @xcite are the most remarkable achievements of the non - local density functionals developed in the last decades .",
    "we believe that the ddf formalism may be used to study the dynamics of densely packed fluids taking full advantage of the description of the correlation structure at short range , given by suitable approximations for the equilibrium @xmath0 $ ]",
    ". the most interesting ( and difficult ) problem would be the study of a closely - packed system , which has not crystallized .",
    "the langevin description ( [ eq : uno ] ) may give extremely slow dynamics since either the random noise has to take the system over large energy barriers ( like in the ideal gas described above ) , or it has to produce rearrangements which are only possible through unlikely correlations of many particles .",
    "within the deterministic dynamic density functional approach ( [ eq : df ] ) this situations may be seen in two possible ways :    \\1 ) the free energy landscape becomes rough and displays many local minima , whose number grows exponentially with the size of the system @xcite , and within our description the system would remain indefinitely trapped in any of these minima , unless it is annealed at a higher temperature .",
    "the idea is that when a uniform liquid is forced to have a density larger than the one corresponding to a liquid at coexistence with the solid , the system starts developing inhomogeneous patterns , which are associated with local minima of the free energy .",
    "one conjecture relates the origin of the glassy behavior in liquids to the existence of these minima , as an extension of the well founded theory of mean - field spin - glasses @xcite , @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) alternatively , the free energy landscape @xmath0 $ ] may be smooth , with a single minimum , because the correlations required to relax the system are described well enough by the free energy functional . in this case , the system will never get really frozen , until it reaches the true equilibrium state , but the dynamics may become so slow that it may appear to be frozen in any practical computation .",
    "the slow dynamics of ( [ eq : df ] ) may be a result of having very low density along current path ( again , as in the ideal gas above ) or of requiring very unlikely ( but not impossible ) correlations of many particles .",
    "this case would correspond to the conjecture that the glassy behaviour in liquids is due to a divergence in the viscosity , and in the relaxation times , rather than to the existence of a metastable freezing.    within the dynamical density functional approach having one or the other way would be a result of using a worse of a better approximation for @xmath0 $ ] . the configurations with a very large escape time , when described by a good density functional , may appear like permanent stable states when the dynamics is described with a poorer approximation for @xmath0 $ ] . in the next section , we present explicit results for a simple model in one dimension which displays these features and illustrates how the structure of the nearly - frozen states may be given by simple df approximations , while the actual calculation of the escape time may require a density functional giving good account of the many - particle correlations .",
    "since neither the correctness nor the feasibility of the approach presented have been tested so far , we shall begin comparing the two levels of description : the brownian dynamics and df dynamics and in order not to introduce unnecessary sources of discrepancies we consider a one dimensional hard - rod system , whose exact equilibrium df is known @xcite , @xcite and which includes strong correlation effects due to the infinite repulsion between the particles .",
    "long ago , percus @xcite was able to determine the exact form of the free energy density functional for an assembly of hard rods of length @xmath77 .",

    "it is worthwhile to point out that @xmath84 is just the two - point equilibrium correlation function @xmath85 evaluated at contact , i.e. when @xmath86 , so that this term takes into account the collisions of the rod at @xmath87 with the remaining particles on the right hand side .",
    "similarly the other term describes the interactions with the left sector .",
    "when the density profile varies very smoothly ( compared with the hard - rod length ) the second term may be written in terms of the local chemical potential and the compressibility and one obtains a diffusion equation with a renormalized constant .",

    "there is a clear enhancement of the effective expansion rate , because the rods at the two ends of the packet have a strong bias towards moving away from the the packet .",

    "the slope of @xmath98 goes to the ideal value , but the enhanced expansion at small @xmath29 produces a shift of the values with respect to the ideal gas .",
    "the comparison between the ddf and the average over 2000 langevin simulations again shows the same overall trend and also the same dependence with @xmath2 , but the ddf gives always a slightly larger expansion rate .",
    "the case with @xmath95 offers a clear explanation for this discrepancy : with a single rod in the system there should be no collisions and the results should be those of the ideal gas , but the second term in the ddf equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) , obtained with the exact @xmath0 $ ] , still gives a contribution , unless @xmath100 for any @xmath87 .",
    "the reason is that in the exact @xmath0 $ ] ( [ eq : percus ] ) , as for any density functional used in the ddf , the density distribution has to be interpreted in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "it corresponds to a system in contact with a particle reservoir , in which the chemical potential is set to give the average value of @xmath2 ; however , the configurations contributing to the density distribution may have any number of particles . in the system with @xmath101",
    ", there would be contributions from the density distributions with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , ... ( compensated with the contribution with @xmath104 ) , and these contributions include the effects of the collisions .    in general , the fluctuation in the number of particles opens a relaxation path which is not present in the langevin simulations , carried with fixed @xmath2 .",
    "this extra relaxation path produces the faster damping of the oscillations in the density profiles and the larger diffusion rate of the ddf .",
    "the effect is important only in the intermediate stage of the expansion because for @xmath105 the compressibility of the the system is too low to have important fluctuations in @xmath2 and for @xmath99 the system is so diluted that the total effect of collisions is negligible .",
    "in figure([fig : tres ] ) we display the density profiles for a system of four hard rods falling to the bottom of a parabolic potential well , @xmath106 , with @xmath107 . at @xmath90",
    "the rods are located at @xmath108 and @xmath109 , well separated from each other . during the first stages of the time evolution each rod follows a steady drift due to the external force and , at the same time , they develop gaussian peaks of increasing width , due to the random diffusion . the collisions between the two rods at each side of the potential well become important for @xmath110 ; later the two packets collide and relax to the equilibrium density distribution , which is reached for @xmath111 , within our numerical precision .",
    "the results of the ddf and the average over 2000 langevin simulations are in good agreement , although small discrepancies may be observed both in the early drifting peaks and in the final ( equilibrium ) profiles .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies is again the difference between the langevin simulation with fixed @xmath2 and the grand - canonical ddf .",
    "the final equilibrium density distribution with the langevin simulation corresponds to the canonical ensemble and for systems with small number of particles it is known to be different from the grand - canonical distribution @xcite . in our case , the difference depends on the value of the parameter @xmath112 , in the external potential : for @xmath113 the rods are very tightly packed , the compressibility is very low and the fluctuations in the number @xmath2 are very small ; for @xmath114 the final equilibrium profile is very broad , without oscillations , and the effect of the collision is too weak to produce observable differences ; but for intermediate values @xmath115 the difference between the canonical and the grand canonical ensemble may be quite important and it is reflected in the different time evolution predicted by the ddf and by the langevin simulations .",
    "the use of a canonical @xmath0 $ ] in the ddf equation ( [ eq : df ] ) would , in all probability , give a better agreement between the two methods , but unfortunately we are not aware of any explicit canonical density functional for interacting particles .",
    "nevertheless , the use of the equilibrium @xmath0 $ ] to include the role of the molecular correlations is always an approximation , so that even without considering the difference in the thermodynamic ensemble , it was not obvious that the agreement between the ddf and the langevin simulation would be as good as observed in the preceeding figures",
    ".      the third check of the theory , being considered , is the relaxation in a system which requires strongly correlated motions of all the particles .",
    "we place the hard rods in a periodic external potential @xmath116 , with minima at any integer values of @xmath87 .",
    "the hard - rods length is taken as @xmath117 , so that two rods can not be at the bottom of nearest - neighbour wells .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions with total length @xmath118 and set @xmath119 rods , which at the initial time are at the bottom of every second well of @xmath120 .",
    "the equilibrium density distribution , which may be obtained directly by the minimization of the exact free energy density functional , has the full symmetry of the the external potential , so that the relaxation process has to shift ( on average ) half a particle from the initially occupied wells to those wells which are initially empty .",
    "however , the jump of a rod over the barrier , to the next potential well , is not compatible with keeping the next rod at the bottom of its potential well .",
    "the system has to pay the extra energy of keeping the two consecutive rods away from the minima or it has to relay on a correlated motion of the @xmath2 rods , to shift from one subset of minima to the other one .    in figure ( [ fig : cuatro ] ) we present the time evolution of the density profiles with @xmath121 showing different times , for both the ddf equation ( [ eq : df],[eq : rho ] ) and the average of the langevin simulations over @xmath122 realizations of the noise . in both cases",
    "the relaxation is slow ( compared with the previous examples ) and it becomes much slower for increasing values of @xmath123 or @xmath77 . in agreement with our general prediction",
    "eq.([eq : decrease ] ) , the system flows to the unique equilibrium state , density peaks grow at the positions of the potential wells which were initially empty until the exact equilibrium density profile is obtained .",
    "the comparison of the result clearly shows that the ddf equation , with the exact percus free energy , approaches the equilibrium state faster than the average of the langevin simulation .",
    "this difference is related again to the use of different statistical ensembles : the canonical langevin equation keeps constant @xmath2 while the grand - canonical @xmath0 $ ] allows for fluctuations in the number of particles , keeping only the average .",
    "the changes in @xmath2 in the ddf open a new relaxation path and gives a faster relaxation , even is the final equilibrium density profiles in the canonical and the grand - canonical ensembles are very similar .    to get a quantitative description of the relaxation times",
    "we define an order parameter which gives , at any time , the relative difference between the occupation of the odd and the even potential wells , @xmath124 .",
    "the initial condition sets @xmath125 and the final equilibrium state corresponds to @xmath126 . both in the case of the ddf and of the langevin dynamics we observe a pure exponential decay , @xmath127 so that whole process may be described by the relaxation time @xmath128 . the importance of the particle correlations in the slowing of the relaxation dynamics is shown in figure ( [ fig : cinco ] ) through the dependence of the relaxation time with on the size of the hard - cores , @xmath129 , keeping the same external potential . both the langevin dynamics and",
    "the ddf show a fast decrease of @xmath128 , by nearly two orders of magnitude , when the rod size decreases from @xmath117 to @xmath130 , which makes the occupancy of neighbour potential wells easier .",
    "the increase of the external potential amplitude , for fixed @xmath117 , produces similar results , as presented in figure ( [ fig : seis ] ) . the relaxation time grows faster than exponentially with @xmath123 , and the results of the ddf follow from below the general trend of the langevin dynamics , over several order of magnitude for @xmath128 . for comparison we present in the same figure the relaxation times for the ideal gas in the same external potential .",
    "the conclusion is that the ddf formalism , with the the exact equilibrium free energy density functional , is able to reproduce qualitatively the low relaxational dynamics of a system produced by the packing constraints of molecular hard cores . in our example the final equilibrium state , with equal occupancy of all the potential wells ,",
    "represents a superposition of highly correlated states , in which all the particles are in alternate wells , either in the odd or the even positions . the relaxation from the asymmetric initial state requires strong correlations , with all the particles moving together or in cascade , and the unlikelyness of these correlations gives the long relaxation time .",
    "this process may be regarded as a ( very simplified ) simile of the relaxation from a very dense , non - crystalline initial state : the approach to equilibrium may require the correlated rearrangement of many molecules , the unlikelyness of these correlations produces relaxation times which are so long that the system may appear as frozen in an ill crystallized state .",
    "the one - dimensional hard - rod system provides an interesting test to the ddf , because we may use the exact equilibrium density functional .",
    "unfortunately , given the hamiltonian describing a set of @xmath2 interacting particles in a d - dimensional space , the exact free energy functional is in general unknown , since the exactness would be equivalent to calculating the exact partition function of the model in any external potential .",
    "consequently one must rely on suitable approximation schemes and , in the case of repulsive hard - core interactions , there exist several approximate methods which yield accurate results @xcite .",
    "the requirements imposed are : first , one must recover the thermodynamic properties of the homogeneous fluid ; second , one must reproduce the structure of highly inhomogeneous systems ; finally , the approximation must satisfy a number of exact relations .    among the most successful density functionals approximations for the free energy of hard spheres we have those known under the generic name of weighted density approximations ( wda ) .",
    "the main assumption is that for each particle , at some point @xmath131 , there is a contribution to the excess free energy , @xmath132 , which is a local function of a weighted density @xmath133 , obtained by averaging the true density profile @xmath134 over a small region centered at @xmath131 : @xmath135    the excess free energy per particle , @xmath136 , is obtained from the bulk equation of state and the weight function is set to get a good ( approximate ) description of the bulk correlation structure .",
    "different recipes have been used and in general they require a density dependent weight function @xcite , @xcite . however",
    ", even the simplest version in which @xmath137 is taken to be density independent and equal to the normalized mayer function , @xmath138 , is enough to give a qualitative description of the hard - sphere freezing @xcite .    in this section",
    "we explore the consequences of using the ddf formalism , ( [ eq : df ] ) with approximate forms for @xmath0 $ ] , so that the molecular correlations are represented by an approximation to the true equilibrium correlations . to carry out this analysis we study the same systems described in the previous section but instead of taking the exact percus density functional , ( [ eq : percus ] )",
    ", we use an approximate description of the hard rods similar to those developed for hard spheres .",
    "in particular , the wda for hard rods with the exact bulk equation of state and the zeroth - order constant weight function takes @xmath139 =    \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } dx \\",

    "there is also a different combination of the functions evaluated in ( [ eq : rho ] ) and in ( [ eq : rhowda ] ) , but it is easy to check that in the low density limit , truncating at second order in the density , both equations become identical .",
    "this reflects that the wda includes the exact leading term of the molecular correlations in a density expansion , while the higher - order terms are approximated . for the equilibrium properties",
    "it is known that this type of zeroth - order wda overestimates the effects of the hard - core packing and it becomes more accurate when the weight function is allowed to depend on the weighted density .",
    "the results obtained with this approximate free energy for the problems a and b in the previous section are qualitatively similar to those with the exact @xmath0 $ ] . in the free expansion of a dense state the wda keeps the oscillations in @xmath146 for a longer time than the results with ( [ eq : rho ] ) , reflecting the overestimation of the hard core packing , but the mean square displacements are very similar to those in figure ( [ fig : uno ] ) .",
    "the equivalent trends are observed in the problem b ; although there is some difference between the exact and the wda equilibrium states , the dynamics is rather similar .",
    "we have also checked , in some cases , that the use of a better wda approximation , with the density dependence of the weight function expanded up to second order , gives results closer to those with the exact @xmath0 $ ] . in this way we have checked that the practical use of the ddf formalism does not depend on having the exact equilibrium @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the use of wda or other density functional approximations opens a wide road for the study of the dynamical properties of many systems , with a level of approximation comparable to the accuracy of the results for the equilibrium properties .",
    "the system studied in the last subsection provided the most severe test for the ddf , since it was the case in which the molecular correlations played the most important role , and this system is the one in which the the use of an approximated @xmath0 $ ] may lead to qualitative differences .",
    "we have solved ( [ eq : df ] ) with ( [ eq : rhowda ] ) for the same system of @xmath119 hard rods in a periodic external potential as before and look for the relaxation from the asymmetric density distribution . for the system presented in figure ( [ fig : cuatro ] ) , with @xmath117 and @xmath121 , there is a qualitative difference with the results of using the exact @xmath0 $ ] . with the wda free energy the time evolution of @xmath146 goes to a stable very asymmetric profile , with an order parameter @xmath147 , indicating that the particles remain mainly in the potential wells where they are initially located .",
    "the freezing of the initial asymmetry is only possible because the wda equilibrium free energy for this system has two different minima , with positive and negative values of @xmath148 , instead of the single minimum with @xmath126 given by the exact @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the approximate inclusion of the hard - core correlations in the wda is not good enough to average over the two types of configurations which appear as separated equilibrium states and , for the same reason , the ddf equation can not include the dynamic path between the two types of configurations .    for lower values of the external potential ( or higher temperature )",
    "we find that the final order parameter predicted by the wda decreases , as in a phase transition . indeed , the splitting of the equilibrium state is nothing but a spurious phase transition predicted by an approximate @xmath0 $ ] . below a critical value of @xmath149",
    "the wda recovers a single symmetric equilibrium state with @xmath126 .",
    "the relaxation time diverges as we approach the phase transition and it is presented in figure ( [ fig : seis ] ) together with the results of the exact @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this divergence is obviously a spurious result of the approximation used for @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the only reasonable interpretation is that whenever an approximate free energy density functional has different local minima , in which the ddf equation may get trapped , the exact dynamics of the system would require rather long times to relax the density along the the functional path related to the order parameter of the spurious phase transition .",
    "the ddf with the wda is good enough to identify the slow density path , along the parameter @xmath148 , and it is good enough to describe the relaxation dynamics along other functional directions , but it can not be used to describe the relaxation of @xmath148 .    we have checked that on improving the wda , by including the density dependence of the weight function , the spurious phase transition is shifted towards larger values of @xmath123 . again a better approximation for the equilibrium free energy functional also gives a better account of the molecular correlations in the ddf equation , since it is able to find relaxation paths which were not seen by simpler df approximations .",
    "however , when @xmath123 goes beyond a new threshold value ( i.e. when the exact relaxation time becomes too large for the approximate @xmath0 $ ] ) the spurious phase transition reappears .    we have also tested the predictions of the ddf with an even simpler approximation for the equilibrium density functional .",

    "the assumption leading to this result is that the correlation structure in the system out of equilibrium is replaced by that in the equilibrium system with the same density distribution .",

    "<S> we present a new time - dependent density functional approach to study the relaxational dynamics of an assembly of interacting particles subject to thermal noise . starting from the langevin stochastic equations of motion for the velocities of the particles we are able by means of an approximated closure to derive a self - consistent deterministic equation for the temporal evolution of the average particle density . </S>",
    "<S> the closure is equivalent to assuming that the equal - time two - point correlation function out of equilibrium has the same properties as its equilibrium version . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in time of the density depend on the functional derivatives of the grand canonical free energy functional @xmath0 $ ] of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the static solutions of the equation for the density correspond to the exact equilibrium profiles provided one is able to determine the exact form of @xmath0 $ ] . in order to assess the validity of our approach we performed a comparison between the langevin dynamics and the dynamic density functional method for a one - dimensional hard - rod system in three relevant cases and found remarkable agreement , with some interesting exceptions , which are discussed and explained . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider the case where one is forced to use an approximate form of @xmath0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally we compare the present method with the stochastic equation for the density proposed by other authors [ kawasaki , kirkpatrick etc . ] and discuss the role of the thermal fluctuations . </S>"
