    "a particle in a @xmath0-function potential @xmath1 and particle in a box of size @xmath5 that runs from @xmath6 to @xmath7 are two pedagogical examples discussed in introductory quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite the first is often used to model short - ranged , elastic impurities whereas the second serves as a model for semiconductor quantum dots and quantum wells at low temperatures . in the first case ,",
    "when @xmath8 , the spectrum develops a single bound state with negative energy @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the particle , and the continuous spectrum at positive energies remains unchanged . in the second case ,",
    "all states are localized within the box and have discrete energy eigenvalues given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the characteristic energy scale for the box .",
    "the problem of particle in a box with a @xmath0-function potential has been recently investigated  @xcite using perturbative expansion in the strength of the @xmath0-function potential @xmath13 .",
    "one salient feature of this problem is that the perturbation affects the energies of all eigenfunctions that do not vanish at @xmath14 ; this is in marked contrast to a particle in @xmath0-function potential .",
    "@xcite    we point out in this note that the aforementioned problem is solvable in both , weak coupling @xmath2 and strong coupling @xmath3 , limits . in either limit _",
    "the attractive and repulsive potentials have identical spectra _ except for a single bound - state that appears for the attractive potential ; identical spectra are naturally expected when the @xmath0-function perturbation vanishes , @xmath2 .",
    "the strong - coupling result raises a question regarding the completeness of eigenfunctions in these two cases ; the attractive potential has one more eigenstate - the bound state - in the spectrum compared to the repulsive potential .",
    "we show that the contribution of the bound state to the completeness relation vanishes when @xmath4 .",
    "we numerically obtain the spectra for intermediate values of @xmath15 and compare them with perturbative corrections to the strong - coupling results .",
    "let us consider a particle in a box with @xmath0-function potential inside it , @xmath16 where @xmath17 . the time - dependent schrdinger equation implies that the eigenvalues @xmath18 and eigenfunctions @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 the eigenfunctions @xmath19 are continuous and vanish outside the box . at positive energies , the ( unnormalized ) eigenfunctions are given by @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 is the smaller ( greater ) of ( @xmath23 ) , and the eigenenergies are @xmath24 . when @xmath25 the corresponding eigenfunction is @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 .",
    "integrating eq.([eq : sch ] ) over a small interval ( @xmath28 ) gives the quantization conditions @xmath29 & = & 0,\\\\ \\label{eq : discont2 } v\\sinh(v)+\\lambda\\sinh(pv)\\sinh[(1-p)v ] & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined ( dimensionless ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the dimensionless @xmath0-function strength @xmath32 .",
    "first we will discuss the negative - energy solution .",
    "eq.([eq : discont2 ] ) has no nonzero solution if @xmath33 . for @xmath8",
    ", a small-@xmath34 and large-@xmath34 expansion shows that it has exactly one nonzero solution when @xmath35 .",
    "the critical strength @xmath36 required for the negative - energy state increases as the @xmath0-function is moved closer to one of the walls . for a `` strong '' attractive potential , @xmath37 , we recover the result for a free - particle with @xmath0-function perturbation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig : bound ] shows the spectra @xmath40 for different strengths of the attractive potential obtained by numerically solving eq.([eq : discont2 ] ) , and verifies the results we have derived analytically .",
    "next we will focus on the ( more interesting ) positive energy solutions .",
    "when @xmath41 the eigenvalues @xmath42 are determined by eq.([eq : discont1 ] ) . in the weak coupling limit @xmath2",
    "we recover the well - known result , @xmath43 . in the strong coupling limit @xmath3 , the solutions of eq.([eq : discont1 ] )",
    "are given by @xmath44 this spectrum is the _ same irrespective of the sign of the potential _ and it is symmetric in @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the strong - coupling limit corresponds to two infinite wells with widths @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectra for both attractive ( blue - solid ) and repulsive ( red - dotted ) potential when @xmath48 .",
    "recall that the spectrum for particle in a box is horizontal lines at @xmath49 . in the strong - coupling limit",
    ", we see that the @xmath50-state for attractive potential ( blue - solid ) and the @xmath51-state for the repulsive potential ( red - dotted ) approach each other .",
    "@xcite to better understand eq.([eq : pboxdelta ] ) , let us consider the spectrum for a specific case , say @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , the low - lying states @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are marked by the circles .",
    "the rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the states with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "since either gives the same value of @xmath58 , the degeneracy in the strong - coupling limit is doubled . in general , a double - degeneracy at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) arises when @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "in particular , at the symmetric point @xmath63 the entire spectrum , given by @xmath64 , is doubly - degenerate and represents the symmetric and antisymmetric states in a double quantum well . for a finite @xmath65 , eqs.([eq : discont1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pboxdelta ] )",
    "give the following perturbative correction  @xcite @xmath66\\ ] ] when @xmath67 and a corresponding expression with @xmath68 provided @xmath69 .",
    "eq.([eq : corr ] ) shows that near the strong - coupling limit , the repulsive potential _ suppresses _ the energy and attractive potential raises it .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the weak - coupling limit  @xcite where the first order perturbative correction is given by @xmath70.\\ ] ] this unusual behavior arises because , in contrast to all other potentials , the @xmath0-function spectrum is well - defined in the strong - coupling limit , and is the same irrespective of the sign of the potential .",
    "we conclude the note with a comment on the completeness relation .",
    "the completeness of eigenfunctions in the attractive and repulsive cases implies that @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the _",
    "normalized _ positive - energy eigenfunctions , and the _ normalized _ negative - energy eigenfunction is given by @xmath74 with @xmath75 \\left[\\sinh(2p\\kappa a)- ( 2p\\kappa a)\\right]+\\left[p\\rightarrow ( 1-p)\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in the strong - coupling limit , @xmath76 and eq.([eq : norm ] ) implies that @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the contribution to eq.([eq:1negative ] ) from the negative - energy state vanishes in the strong - coupling limit , as the two spectra at positive energies converge .",
