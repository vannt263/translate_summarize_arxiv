    "we describe the calibration of the low frequency circuitry for voltage bias and current measurement and the microwave components used to define the environment of the junction and to measure the emitted radiation .",
    "in addition to the components depicted in fig .  1 in the paper , the low frequency circuit includes multipole rc low pass filters in the bias line ( cutoff at @xmath110 ) and the current measurement lines ( cutoff at @xmath111 ) , several capacitors to ground and a copper powder filter between readout resistor and bias t ( see fig .  [ setupdetail ] ) .",
    "_ calibration _ of the division factor of the voltage divider used for biasing the sample is performed in situ by reading out the applied bias voltage through one of the lines used for current measurements ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we use a lock - in technique for this measurement and minimize the critical current of the junction so that the current through the sample is negligible .",
    "the @xmath16 nicr resistor used for current measurement can not be calibrated in situ due to large lead resistances , but we have verified that a resistor from the same batch does not deviate from its nominal value by more than @xmath112 at the operating temperature of our refrigerator .",
    "the microwave chain ( see fig .  [ setupdetail ] ) consists of the junction , the resonator , a bias t , a @xmath113 attenuator , a triplexer with crossover frequencies 4 and @xmath17 , two 4 to @xmath17 isolators at base temperature , an isolator at @xmath114 , a cryogenic amplifier at @xmath115 with @xmath116 noise temperature , a @xmath117 attenuator at @xmath115 followed by a room temperature amplification and measurement chain .",
    "the isolators protect the sample from the amplifier noise in their working range from 4 to @xmath17 .",
    "the triplexer , working from dc to @xmath109 , connects the sample to the microwave chain only in the 4 to @xmath17 range . outside this range",
    "the sample is connected to cold @xmath118 loads so that the sample `` sees '' a cold @xmath118 load throughout the @xmath109 frequency range of the triplexer .",
    "reflections due to the insertion loss of the triplexer are suppressed by the @xmath113 attenuator .    _ calibration _ of the resonator impedance @xmath4 and the gain of the microwave chain from the sample to the top of the refrigerator is performed in situ because the superconducting resonator must be cooled below its critical temperature and the amplifier gain and cable attenuation depend on temperature .",
    "we perform both calibrations using quasiparticle shot noise as white current noise reference .",
    "we bias the junction at @xmath119 , far above the gap voltage @xmath120 of our junction , where the current noise is in good approximation @xmath121 at frequencies @xmath122 . in order to separate this noise from the noise floor of the cryogenic amplifier ,",
    "we then apply small variations of the bias voltage and measure the corresponding changes in the measured microwave power with a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the conversion of @xmath90 into emitted microwave power depends on the environment impedance @xmath4 seen by the junction and its tunneling resistance @xmath123 .",
    "first , only a fraction @xmath124 of the current noise is absorbed by the environment , but this factor is close to 1 ( @xmath125 ) as @xmath126 is much larger than the environment impedance .",
    "the current noise in the environment has then to be multiplied by @xmath127 to obtain the microwave power emitted by quasiparticle shot noise : @xmath128 the emitted power depends on @xmath4 , therefore @xmath4 and the gain of the microwave chain can not be calibrated independently .",
    "we solve this problem by making the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the gain of the microwave chain is frequency independent in the 5 to @xmath43 range .",
    "2 .   the integral over the peak in @xmath26 from 5 to @xmath43 corresponds to calculations based on the resonator geometry .",
    "assumption 1 is justified by a previous calibration of the gain of the amplifiers , found to be constant in the 5 to @xmath43 range within 0.5 db , and by observing that the noise floor of the amplifier in this experiment in the same 5 to @xmath43 range deviates by less than @xmath129 from its mean value , meaning that the gain and attenuation after the input of the cold amplifier are almost frequency independent .",
    "however , frequency dependent attenuation between the sample and the cryogenic amplifier is not detected this way and can be source of slight inconsistencies .",
    "assumption 2 relates to the fact that the integral over @xmath26 , proportional to the characteristic impedance of the resonance , mainly depends on the transmission line impedance of the quarterwave segment closest to the junction , less on the second segment , and only very weakly on the load impedance beyond the resonator .",
    "for example , the characteristic impedance of the resonance changes by less than @xmath130 when the the load impedance is changed from @xmath118 to any value between @xmath131 and infinity .",
    "therefore we can get an accurate estimate of this integral from the impedance of the resonator segments , even in the presence of imperfections in the line impedance seen from the resonator .",
    "we calculate the characteristic impedance of our quarterwave segments from the designed resonator geometry , checked with an electron microscope and the well known stackup of our sample .",
    "we obtain characteristic impedances @xmath132 and @xmath133 , resulting in a characteristic impedance of the resonance mode of @xmath134 . the fact that @xmath46 theory using this resonator impedance accurately fits the relative heights of first and second order peaks in fig .",
    "2 indicates that this estimation of the resonator impedance is correct .    with these two assumptions we can use eq .  ( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) to separately calibrate the power gain and @xmath4 .",
    "to calibrate the power gain in figs .  2 and 3 we compare the measured shot noise signal to eq .",
    "( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) integrated over the bandwidth of our measurement ranging from 5 to @xmath43 .    in order to determine the spectral dependence of @xmath4 we use a narrow band pass filter ( as for the data in fig .  4 ) to measure a signal proportional to @xmath135 . to extract @xmath26 from the emitted power using eq .",
    "( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) , one would need to know @xmath136 , which is not measured independently . to circumvent this difficulty , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) iteratively to calculate @xmath4 : we start with the calculated impedance @xmath137 in the denominator and in each step calculate a new @xmath138 , normalize it using assumption 2 , and then calculate @xmath139 using the kramers - kronig relations with @xmath138 in the 5 to @xmath43 range where @xmath135 was measured and @xmath137 outside this range .",
    "this procedure converges quickly and yields a precise determination of @xmath26 because @xmath140 and therefore only has a small influence on the extracted @xmath26 .",
    "we give here two derivations of expression ( 5 ) in the paper .",
    "the first one follows the derivation of coulomb blockade in @xcite and treats photon emission as fluctuations in the cooper pair tunneling rate .",
    "the second derivation explicitly evaluates photon emission and absorption rates in a mode of the electromagnetic environment .",
    "the josephson element is described by the hamiltonian @xmath141 and the current operator through the element is @xmath142 the current - current correlator function is then @xmath143 to arrive at the last line we have noted that at non - zero dc bias voltage @xmath1 terms @xmath144 with the same sign in the exponential average to zero .",
    "we decompose the phase difference across the tunnel element @xmath145 into the deterministic part @xmath146 and a fluctuating random phase @xmath147 caused by the fluctuations in the electromagnetic environment .",
    "we use the gaussian character of the noise of the linear environment to rewrite @xcite : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the ( superconducting ) phase - phase correlation function across the impedance , so that ( [ eq : curcor ] ) becomes @xmath150 the ( non - symmetrized ) current noise density @xmath151 is directly the fourier transform of the current  current correlator @xmath152 @xmath153 ( wiener khinchin theorem ) which yields immediately @xmath154 with @xmath155  the fourier transform of @xmath58 . assuming that the mode of the environment at frequency @xmath71 is in the ground state , i.e.  @xmath156 , the current noise gives rise to a photon emission rate density @xmath157        the hamiltonian of the total system is @xmath159 with @xmath160 here @xmath161 is the hamiltonian describing the environment of impedance @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath163 and @xmath164 describe the mode at frequency @xmath165 . a second constraint on @xmath163 and @xmath164 imposed by the requirement that the sum of the resonator impedances approaches @xmath4 , giving @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the spacing between adjacent modes , supposed to be constant .",
    "the cooper pair tunneling rate can now be calculated using fermi s golden rule : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the probability for mode @xmath170 to be in state @xmath171 before the tunneling event .",
    "we assume that the tunneling rate is low so that the environment can reach thermal equilibrium before each tunneling event and the @xmath169 describe thermal equilibrium states .",
    "this equation can be seen as the definition of @xmath46 , the probability density for the environment to absorb energy @xmath57 when a cooper pair tunnels .",
    "calculating @xmath46 by evaluating this sum is possible but cumbersome , so usually the approach from ref .",
    "@xcite is taken .    in order to calculate the rate for emitting photons at frequency @xmath71 we treat mode @xmath172 at @xmath173 separately and keep track of the photon number difference @xmath174 .",
