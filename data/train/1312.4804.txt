    "@xcite was questioned in the papers  @xcite , using different quark - models and approaches , see also the ballpark prediction for hlbl in ref .",
    "the pion - loop contribution was analyzed in ref .",
    "the authors stressed the importance of the pion - polarizability effect and the role of the axial - vector resonance @xmath23 , which are not included in the models used in refs .",
    "@xcite . depending on the value of the pion - polarizability and the model for the @xmath23 resonance",
    "used , a large variation was seen .",
    "the issue was taken up in ref .",
    "@xcite where different models for the pion - loop were studied .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath23 resonance was attempted , but no finite result for @xmath0 could be achieved . with a cutoff of @xmath4 , a result close to the earlier estimate in ref .",
    "@xcite was obtained .",
    "reference  @xcite also pointed out that the very small ( absolute ) value for the pion - loop in ref .",
    "@xcite could be due to the fact that the hls model used in ref .",
    "@xcite has a wrong high - energy behavior and that there is some cancellation between positive and negative contributions in the pion - loop in hlbl .",
    "concerning the future , maybe lattice qcd will provide a reliable calculation of hlbl at some point , see ref .",
    "@xcite for some promising recent results . in the meantime",
    ", only a close collaboration between theory and experiment can lead to a better controlled estimate for hlbl . on the theory side ,",
    "the hadronic models can be improved by short - distance constraints from perturbative qcd to have a better matching at high momenta .",
    "one can also use dispersion relations to connect the theory with experimental data , e.g. in @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "also the issue about whether the dressing of the bare constituent quark - loop leads to a suppression or an enhancement needs to be studied further .",
    "this problem is also related to the question whether there is any double counting involved .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the information on various processes ( decays , form factors , cross - sections ) of hadrons interacting with photons at low and intermediate momenta , @xmath25 , can help to constrain the models .",
    "important experiments which should be pursued include more precise measurements of the ( transition ) form factors of light pseudoscalars with possibly two off - shell photons in the process @xmath26 and the two - photon decay width and the ( double ) dalitz decays of these mesons .",
    "this could further reduce the error of the dominant pseudoscalar exchange contribution  @xcite . concerning the pion - loop contribution , in addition to studying @xmath27 , measurements of the pion - polarizability in various processes , e.g.  in radiative pion decay @xmath28 , in radiative pion photoproduction @xmath29 or with the hadronic primakoff effect @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( with some nucleus @xmath32 ) , can help to improve the models  @xcite . for the development of models with the axial - vector resonance @xmath23 and estimates of the sizable axial - vector contribution , information about the decays @xmath33 would be useful as well .",
    "finally , to extract the needed quantities from experiment will also require the development of dedicated monte carlo programs for the relevant processes  @xcite .",
    "if the recent results for the quark - loop and pion - loop are taken at face value , one obtains the range @xmath34 .",
    "while the new approaches raise some important issues and point to potential shortcomings in the previously used models , these calculations are also still preliminary and further studies are needed .",
    "therefore , the estimate @xmath35 from refs .",
    "@xcite still seems to give a fair description of the current situation .",
