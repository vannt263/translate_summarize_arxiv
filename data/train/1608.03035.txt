    "as such , the observed spectrum , image and visibility are important indicators to determine the flow dynamics when the accretion flow within several schwarzschild radii of the black hole is optically thin enough to be observed ( at mm / sub - mm wavelengths in the case of sgr a@xmath0 ) , and are therefore important topics to be explored .    in the pioneering work of @xcite , the authors investigate the observational appearance of the accretion flow and the shadow of sgr a@xmath0 at mm / sub - mm wavelengths .",

    "this implies that observations at optically thin ( i.e. mm / sub - mm ) wavelengths are crucial to determine the flow dynamics and discriminate between different models .    in what follows",
    ", we adopt the best - fit parameters ( @xmath60 , inclination angle @xmath62 ) constrained by the model fitting for 1.3  mm ( 230  ghz ) vlbi observations in @xcite , which are also consistent with @xcite .",
    "we assume hybrid populations of thermal and non - thermal electrons , which obey a relativistic maxwellian distribution and a power - law distribution in energy , respectively .",
    "the non - thermal electrons follow a power - law distribution with a spectral index of 1.25 ( which corresponds to an energy index of 3.5 ) , and a lower cutoff lorentz factor of @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , similarly to @xcite , the spatial distributions of the temperature and density of these populations are described by @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the normalizations of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , which are equivalent to specifying the accretion rate , are chosen to fit the observed spectrum and are therefore functions of black hole spin and inclination angle .",
    "in such a description , the electron populations decreases rapidly when approaching the funnel region , @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting emission is considered as synchrotron emission from the hybrid populations , with the magnetic field strength determined via , in physical units , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "recent 1.3-mm observations with the eht have detected linear polarization on scales of several @xmath73 , indicating the existence of a magnetic field structure which is predominantly stochastic but also partially ordered on event horizon scales @xcite . however , while the magnetic field configuration is associated with differential motion within the flow via the coupling between the plasma and the magnetic field , the field configuration resulting from different flow dynamics is unclear .",
    "here we adopt the angle - averaged emissivity @xmath74 in @xcite for computing thermal synchrotron emission , and the absorption coefficient @xmath75 is obtained via kirchoff s law . for non - thermal emission ,",
    "the emissivity @xmath76 and absorption coefficient @xmath77 are taken from @xcite , by applying a fixed pitch angle of @xmath78 .",

    "the spectrum includes only thermal synchrotron emission ( @xmath80 ) as shown by dots , for the case of a keplerian flow . for all model spectra ,",
    "thermal synchrotron emission dominates the mm / sub - mm range close to the spectral peak , and non - thermal synchrotron emission is necessary to explain the observed spectrum at lower frequencies .    in order to understand the importance of general - relativistic effects , the empty circles shows the profile for the case where the frequency shift @xmath81 of the radiation is neglected ( i.e.  set to @xmath82 ) in the general - relativistic radiative transfer calculation . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath83 is the photon frequency , @xmath84 is its covariant four momentum , @xmath85 is the four velocity of a fluid particle , and the subscripts `` 0 '' and  @xmath86 \" denotes quantities evaluated , respectively , in the local co - moving frame of the flow and of a distant observer . in the lower - frequency region , the surrounding accretion flow remains optically thick and the observed emission is dominated by the photosphere located far from the black hole .",
    "the frequency shift correction is therefore unimportant in this region .",
    "the self - absorbed synchrotron emission in this part of spectrum is dominated by @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy in the dynamics of the three models results in similar spectral profiles .    as the flow becomes optically thin at several hundred  ghz ( i.e. mm / sub - mm wavelengths ) , the emission from the flow within a few @xmath73 of the black hole becomes observable and the black hole shadow is revealed . in general the frequency shift reduces the observed luminosity , shifting the thermal peak to lower frequencies . the energy shift due to doppler effects arising from the toroidal motion of the flow results in a larger luminosity in the case of a keplerian flow compared to other cases with less significant toroidal motion ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : omega ] for the differences between different flow dynamics ) .",
    "the profiles of keplerian and free - fall cases may be taken as the limiting case of a sub - keplerian riaf , and therefore represent the boundaries of all possible sub - keplerian flows ( i.e. , all possible values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "interestingly , observational data which show variations at different observation epochs are also located within these boundaries .",
    "this indicates that the averaged behavior of non - stationary riaf flow dynamics at different observation epochs may cause the observed variations .",
    "simultaneous atacama large mm / sub - mm array ( alma ) observations at @xmath88 ghz , @xmath89 ghz and @xmath90 ghz will be extremely useful in constraining these models in the optically thin window ( @xmath91  ghz ) .",
    "the corresponding black hole shadow images at @xmath92  mm are dominated by thermal synchrotron emission as shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "the position angle of the bh spin is set to be @xmath93 east of north , close to the best - fit parameter of a keplerian rotating - flow in @xcite . for the case of a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "frame - dragging effects due to the rotation of spacetime are absent , and consequently the luminosity contrast between the left- and right - hand sides of the image ( divided by the projection of the rotation axis of the flow ) are purely determined by the motion of the flow . in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ]",
    "the image of the keplerian model has the largest luminosity contrast ( top left panel ) , and the image of the free - falling flow is axisymmetric ( bottom left panel ) . for the case of a kerr black hole , the resulting shadow image is asymmetric even for a flow in free - fall , with the brighter side corresponding to photons which are doppler boosted into the observer s line - of - sight by frame - dragging ( see e.g. fig . 1 of @xcite ; compare also with the @xmath38 profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] ) .",
    "consequently , the resulting crescent structure from the brighter side is the combined effect of both the fluid dynamics and black hole spin in general .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] , we also show the distributions of the visibility amplitude and phase , which are fourier - transformed from the model image and observables of the vlbi , along with @xmath94-coverages of future eht observations with telescopes at eight different sites ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in spite of different dynamics , for all cases the visibility amplitudes perpendicular to the spin axis are smoother and more extended compared to the direction parallel to the spin axis .",
    "such characteristics may be used for determining the orientation of the black hole spin , as suggested in @xcite . in addition , these three models exhibit significantly different visibility distributions not only at baselines longer than @xmath95  g@xmath96 traced in future full - array observations , but also at shorter baselines already observed in previous campaigns @xcite with us stations at california ( carma ) , arizona ( smt ) and hawaii ( sma , jcmt and cso ) .",
    "these baselines are indicated in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "therefore the dynamics of a riaf are an important factor in interpreting both previous eht observations as well as future observations .    for a more detailed comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] we show the visibility amplitudes of three models on eht baselines and also the data of eht observations in 2009 @xcite and 2013 @xcite .",
    "the angular - broadening due to scattering effects @xcite was corrected with the scattering kernel in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , year - to - year variations in the visibility amplitude can be well - explained simply through the dynamics , without changing other parameters like the black hole spin and inclination angle .",
    "one of the most notable differences between the 2009 and 2013 data is the behavior at long us baselines between the us mainland ( smt , carma ) and hawaii , with baseline lengths of @xmath97  g@xmath96 ; the amplitude decreased with baseline length in 2009 , while it increased in 2013 .",
    "the behavior of the 2009 data can be well - explained with the keplerian model , as already demonstrated in previous studies @xcite .",
    "in the case of the keplerian model , since the black hole shadow is partially covered and smoothed by emission from the approaching side of the toroidal flow , the visibility amplitude has a gaussian - like behavior in the nee - sww direction , where long us baselines are distributed ( see top middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the rising amplitudes in the 2013 data suggest that the black hole shadow should be more clear than in previous years , which can be well reproduced with sub - keplerian or free - fall models .",
    "this indicates that year - to - year structural variations in sgr a@xmath0 on event - horizon scales potentially reflect the non - stationary dynamics of a riaf , whilst simultaneously suggesting that consideration of the flow dynamics is essential in understanding and interpreting data from mm / sub - mm vlbi observations .",
    "we considered three different accretion flow models : ( i ) a keplerian shell rotating outside the isco and infalling with constant angular momentum inside the isco ( e.g. @xcite ) , ( ii ) a sub - keplerian flow ( to mimic the flow motion of a riaf ) , and ( iii ) a flow in free - fall with zero angular momentum at infinity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the sub - keplerian nature of a riaf is important for modeling black hole images at mm / sub - mm wavelengths , and hence crucial for interpreting the observed vlbi visibility and variability of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "our semi - analytic model of riaf dynamics are constructed through a combined description of both keplerian and free - fall fluid motion , and are therefore everywhere sub - keplerian . as first noted by @xcite , if a hydrodynamical flow has a radial profile which is everywhere sub - keplerian , plasmas in the vicinity of the black hole are then able to flow into higher latitudes near the horizon , @xmath98 , resulting in a quasi - spherical geometry .",
    "that is , the height @xmath99-to - cylindrical radius @xmath48 ratio follows a profile @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which is consistent with the assumption of the spatial populations described in equations ( [ eq : p1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p3 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that we assume our riaf model characterises a stationary flow state for given values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( which respectively control @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the flow ) , and that we assume these values may vary from observation to observation due to the sufficiently long dynamical time scale between observations .",
    "in addition , magnetic effects are ignored .",
    "the simple model is useful for future exploration of the parameter space , providing a quick , flexible overview of the most likely flow dynamics ranges .",
    "we plan to perform further detailed analysis using the closure phase data recently published in @xcite , which will prove useful to constrain the dynamics of the accretion flow as well as the black hole spin , its inclination angle , and position angle .",
    "while grmhd simulations with an initial equilibrium torus ( @xmath100 ) have successfully simulated sub - keplerian accretion flows when a stationary state is reached ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further examination of how @xmath102 is affected by the presence of a magnetic field will be important to understand the spatial distribution of plasma in the very vicinity of the event horizon .",
    "for example , it has been discussed in @xcite that the accumulated polar magnetic flux can compress the flow height when approaching the horizon , resulting in @xmath103 ( see top panel of fig .",
    "11 in @xcite and fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "such an understanding is directly related to the shadow image when the flow becomes optically thin .",
    "in addition , compared to that of a simulation in which an initial equilibrium torus is adopted , it is expected that the resulting fluid dynamics of a simulation in which mass is continuously injected onto the grid would be more closer to a free - fall scenario .",
    "such boundary conditions have been applied in many hydrodynamical or mhd simulations with a pseudo - newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "future comparison between different grmhd simulation results and our model parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 will help to improve the modelling of riaf flows .",
