    "massive star clusters ( @xmath3 ) should form @xmath4 stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) through normal stellar evolution , and , as long as bh birth kicks are sufficiently low , most should be retained initially in the cluster @xcite . with masses of @xmath5 ,",
    "the bhs quickly segregate toward the dense central region of the cluster where they interact dynamically to form binaries with either a normal star or another compact remnant as a companion .",
    "these binaries can evolve to produce x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) or merging compact object binaries potentially detectable by future ground - based gravitational wave ( gw ) observatories ( ligo , virgo ; @xcite ) .",
    "these systems could be found either inside clusters or in the field after being dynamically ejected .",
    "it is well known that the formation rate per unit mass of xrbs is orders of magnitude larger in massive clusters than it is in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which suggests that stellar dynamics must play an essential role in producing xrbs in present - day clusters .    for several decades , observations , theoretical arguments , and simulations",
    "have all suggested that old globular clusters ( gcs ) should have very few ( perhaps @xmath6 ) bhs remaining at present .",
    "while many xrbs had been discovered in galactic gcs @xcite , they had all been clearly identified as accreting neutron stars ( ns ) ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , there were no good candidates for bhs in extragalactic gcs ( for a review of gc x - ray sources as of 2006 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of bhs from gcs was explained with simple theoretical arguments based on the prediction that all bhs should rapidly concentrate near the cluster center through dynamical friction from the low - mass background stars @xcite .",
    "eventually the bhs would succumb to the so - called spitzer `` mass - segregation instability '' @xcite and form a very dense subsystem within the cluster core that consists primarily of bhs and is dynamically decoupled from the other stars .",
    "the small-@xmath7 sub - cluster of bhs has a very short relaxation time , so it should promptly undergo its own core collapse , begin to form hard binaries through three - body interactions , and subsequently eject single and binary bhs .",
    "this sub - system should then completely evaporate within at most a few gyr , leaving behind a gc essentially devoid of bhs well before reaching the @xmath8  gyr ages typical of galactic gcs .",
    "several other theoretical studies later confirmed these predictions through numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    over the last few years , however , our understanding of bhs in dense star clusters has taken a dramatic turn .",
    "the old story began to change when the first bh xrb candidate was identified inside an old gc in the galaxy ngc  4472 @xcite .",
    "several more bh candidates have subsequently been discovered in extragalactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite discovered _ two _ bhs inside of the galactic gc m22 .",
    "these stellar bh candidates are the first ever to be identified in a milky way gc , as well as the first to be discovered through radio observations . by assuming that these systems are bh  white - dwarf ( wd ) binaries , strader et al",
    ".  were able to use published theoretical models by @xcite to estimate the fraction of present - day bhs in gcs that are actively accreting from a wd companion .",
    "they estimate that the detection of two accreting bhs in m22 implies a total number of @xmath9 bhs .",
    "the same group recently found another bh in a different galactic gc , m62 , also through radio observations @xcite .",
    "several additional candidates may soon be added to this list ( strader , private communication ) .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "several recent studies have provided hints that old clusters might actually be able to retain significant numbers of bhs .",
    "@xcite used @xmath7-body simulations of clusters with bhs to explain the trend of increasing spread in core radius with cluster age that is observed in the magellanic clouds .",
    "they found that a population of retained bhs could provide a heat source for some clusters , offering a possible explanation for the observed spread in the radii of magellanic cloud clusters . in some of their models , significant numbers of bhs ( as many as @xmath10 ) were retained for @xmath11  gyr .",
    "@xcite presented a scaled - down direct @xmath7-body model of m22 . at an age of 12  gyr ,",
    "their model contains 16 bhs ( about 1/3 of the initially - retained population ) , which is consistent with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "our own preliminary monte carlo study by @xcite suggested that some clusters may retain as many as hundreds of bhs for 12  gyr .",
    "the long - term survival of such a large number of bhs is explained by the fact that the bhs do not become spitzer unstable on the whole , but instead the majority of the bhs remain well mixed with the rest of the cluster throughout the entire 12  gyr evolution .    a very different study by @xcite focused on the evolution of two - component clusters consisting of a population of bhs co - existing within a background cluster of low - mass stars .",
    "they provide analytic calculations as well as direct @xmath7-body simulations which both suggest that the flow of energy between the sub - cluster of bhs and the rest of the stars is ultimately determined by the cluster as a whole . from this",
    "it follows that the rate of energy production in the bh subsystem , as well as its evaporation rate , is also regulated by the whole cluster .",
    "this implies that bhs can be retained for much longer than previously thought ( i.e. , for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the initial half - mass relaxation timescale ) because their dynamical evolution happens on the evolutionary timescale of the whole cluster , as opposed to that of the bh subsystem .",
    "this suggests that the long - standing assumption that bhs actually decouple from clusters , which is the basis for the argument that old clusters should be deplete of bhs , may no longer hold true .    while the theoretical arguments presented in @xcite are interesting and suggestive , these two - component models can not be directly compared to real gcs , which have a broad spectrum of stellar and bh masses , as well as larger total cluster masses .",
    "several more - realistic studies have now predicted the survival of at least some bhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there is still no definitive answer as to _ how many",
    "_ might actually be hiding in old gcs at present , nor whether models that do retain many bhs will look like observed galactic gcs .",
    "the answers to these questions can help to constrain the initial populations of bhs and bh kicks , both of which are still highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , the topic of stellar bhs in clusters is worthy of further theoretical study .    in this paper",
    ", we present a large grid of monte carlo simulations of realistic , large-@xmath7 , milky - way - like gcs and address the question of retention of bhs in clusters and the dynamical evolution of clusters with bhs .",
    "we are most interested in understanding whether clusters can retain significant numbers of bhs all the way to present and still have observable properties similar to the gcs in our own galaxy .",
    "our focus , therefore , is on clusters that initially retain most of the bhs that form , under the assumption that bhs receive small birth kicks ( compared to nss ; see section  [ methodoverview ] ) .",
    "this work has been made possible by the recent parallelization of our code , which has provided the speed up necessary to simulate star clusters with up to @xmath14 stars , large populations of bhs , and realistic stellar physics @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we give an overview of our computational method , including a new comparison with a direct @xmath7-body study focusing on bhs .",
    "we provide the initial conditions that we have used for our calculations in section  [ ics ] .",
    "the results of our 42 simulations are described in detail in section  [ results ] . finally in section  [ discussionconclusions ]",
    "we summarize our results , compare to previous studies , discuss the uncertainties in our assumptions , and give our conclusions .",
    "we use a monte carlo ( mc ) method for modeling the dynamical evolution of gcs . while the direct @xmath7-body method is more accurate than mc schemes",
    ", it can only simulate clusters with up to @xmath15 due to the poor scaling with @xmath7 ( computation time @xmath16 ) . in order to model large mw gcs with initial @xmath7 up to @xmath14 , and to cover the large parameter space of relevant initial conditions",
    ", we must employ a more approximate technique .",
    "in mc methods , the computation time scales as @xmath17 , which makes it feasible to model realistic gcs and to study the evolution of rare objects , such as bhs .",
    "our mc implementation is a variation of the so - called  orbit - averaged monte carlo method \" developed by @xcite for solving the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the details of our method are described in many previous studies @xcite where we have also shown our results to be in excellent agreement with direct @xmath7-body simulations . here",
    "we highlight the most important details for our study of bhs in clusters .",
    "we treat the cluster on a star - by - star basis , which makes it possible to layer on complexity , such as stellar evolution and strong binary interactions .",
    "stars and binaries are evolved according to the stellar evolution fitting formulae and interacting binary evolution calculations of sse and bse ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we use the modified stellar remnant formation prescription of @xcite , which is based on the theoretical calculations of @xcite . in this prescription , bhs can form either through  direct collapse \" ( i.e. , with no supernova explosion ) or through partial fallback of material that was initially expelled in a supernova explosion , depending on the mass of the stellar core just before bh formation",
    ". the range of initial masses that form bhs , as well as the formation mechanism and the final bh masses , are all dependent on the details of the stellar evolution scheme and metallicity . for @xmath18 ,",
    "our implementation produces bh masses in the range @xmath19 .",
    "stars with initial masses @xmath20 directly collapse into bhs at the end of their lifetime , while those with initial masses between @xmath21 form bhs through fallback .",
    "all nss and some bhs receive natal kicks assumed to be generated by the asymmetric ejection of mass during a supernova explosion .",
    "ns kicks are drawn from a maxwellian distribution with @xmath22  km s@xmath23 .",
    "we assume momentum - conserving kicks , which means that bhs , being significantly more massive than nss , receive much smaller kicks ( if any ) .",
    "we follow the prescription of @xcite to reduce the bh kick magnitude ( initially drawn from the ns kick distribution ) according to the amount of material that falls back onto the final bh after the supernova explosion . in this",
    "prescription , bhs that form via direct collapse do not receive any natal kick , as there is no associated explosion . for compact object binaries bse",
    "calculates the orbital evolution due to emission of gw radiation , which is important for tracking the mergers of bh  bh binaries .",
    "once a binary is ejected from the cluster , however , it is no longer evolved with our code , even though these bh  bh binaries can still potentially merge in the field . for these systems , we estimate the merger time using a simplified timescale for gw inspiral in the weak - field limit @xcite based on the properties at the time of ejection .",
    "in addition to two - body relaxation , it is also important to accurately model the dynamics of _ close _ binary encounters .",
    "we choose strong binary - binary ( b - b ) and binary - single ( b - s ) using mc sampling based on the cross - section for a close interaction between the pair of neighboring objects .",
    "these interactions are then integrated directly using ` fewbody ` , which allows for many important effects within binary systems , such as exchanges , ionization , hardening of binaries , and ejections , all of which are relevant for the evolution of bhs in clusters .",
    "we have recently implemented a simplified prescription for three - body binary formation , a process that is expected to produce an important population of hard bh binaries @xcite , and is therefore extremely important for this study .",
    "if three single stars experience a close resonant encounter , it is possible for two of the stars to become gravitationally bound to one another , with the third star carrying away the extra energy .",
    "the probability of binary formation is usually quite low , and realistically only becomes significant under the extreme conditions expected at the core of a cluster which has been driven to collapse by a population of bhs . for non - compact stars",
    "three - body binary formation is never important , as it would require a density so high that physical collisions would instead have become dominant much earlier @xcite .",
    "therefore we restrict our attention to bhs .",
    "in addition , we are only interested in dynamically hard binaries @xcite , as only those are expected to survive within the cluster environment .",
    "our simplified prescription relies on the calculation of the rate at which three neighboring single bhs will form a hard binary . using the calculated rate and the current timestep",
    ", we can estimate the probability that the three - body system will result in binary formation , and then use mc sampling to select which systems will actually form a new binary .",
    "our implementation follows @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where the binary formation rate is expressed in terms of the binary hardness ratio ( binary binding energy to background star kinetic energy ) @xmath24 here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the masses of the two stars assumed to form a binary , @xmath27 is their separation at pericenter , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the local average mass and velocity dispersion .    keeping both the geometric and gravitational focusing contributions to the cross section",
    ", we construct an expression for the rate of binary formation for the selected neighboring three stars .",
    "we calculate the rate at which two stars with masses @xmath25 and @xmath26 will form a binary with hardness @xmath30 during a close encounter with a third star of mass @xmath31 using @xmath32 , \\label{eq : gamma}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the local number density and @xmath34 is the average relative velocity at infinity , both of which are computed using a subset of nearby stars ( see section  [ methodnbody ] for details ) .",
    "we only form binaries with @xmath35 , with the specific value chosen for each new binary from a distribution according to the differential rate , d@xmath36/d@xmath37 , with lower limit @xmath38 .",
    "after a binary is formed , the new properties of all involved objects are calculated from conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "the mc approach requires the calculation of local average of several physical quantities .",
    "for example , both the physics of three - body binary formation described above and the selection of the relaxation time depend on the local number density , velocity dispersion , and average stellar mass at a specific radius in the cluster @xcite . however , it is not the case that these averages should be computed over the same number of stars . while three - body binary formation should depend only on the properties of neighboring stars ,",
    "the relaxation time step must be applied to the entire cluster .",
    "we both expect and require three - body binary formation to be more sensitive to local spikes in number density and velocity dispersion than the cluster - wise relaxation time .",
    "therefore , we must adjust the number of stars used for computing these averages , depending on the scale of the physics in question .",
    "as in previous works using our mc code @xcite we determine the optimal code parameters by comparing to direct @xmath7-body simulations with identical initial conditions . since the primary focus of this study is the retention of bhs , we choose for our main test the idealized two - component models recently studied by @xcite , which provides a simplified description of the evolution of a population of stellar - mass bhs in a cluster .",
    "these models are a realization of standard plummer spheres populated by a large population of low - mass stellar objects and a smaller population of massive objects , considered to be bhs .",
    "we consider models with an individual mass ratio of @xmath39 , and a total cluster mass ratio of @xmath40 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the masses of individual particles , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the total masses of each component .",
    "we performed comparison simulations with @xmath43 and @xmath44 particles , although only the @xmath43 runs are illustrated here .    in figure  [ fig:2species64k ]",
    ", we compare the cluster properties as reported by the @xmath7-body simulations of @xcite to those computed by our mc code .",
    "empirically , we find optimal agreement by computing the average quantities over the nearest 40 stars for two - body relaxation , and the nearest 6 stars for three - body binary formation .",
    "in particular , the evaporation rate of the bh subcluster in our simulations matches the @xmath7-body results very well .",
    "furthermore , we find that our mc approach correctly reproduces the time evolution of the half - mass radius to within 8% after @xmath45 @xmath7-body time units .    of the measured cluster properties , only the core radius can not be reproduced perfectly by the mc approach . immediately following core collapse",
    ", the measured core radius for the mc model differs from the @xmath7-body results by as much as 65% .",
    "this is to be expected : once mass segregation and core collapse have occurred , the dynamics of the core is primarily driven by the bh subsystem , which has dynamically decoupled from the cluster in these idealized models .",
    "modeling accurately the internal dynamics of a sub - system with @xmath46 particles using an orbit - averaged mc approach is very challenging ; however , as the bhs are ejected , and the core becomes populated with a larger number of lower mass stars , the validity of the mc approach is restored , and the core radius better agrees with the direct @xmath7-body results .",
    "additionally , the core radius is known to be very sensitive to stochastic physical effects , such as three - body binary formation , so that the agreement between two different models can at best be statistical @xcite .",
    "new techniques are under investigation that will correctly evolve the subcluster dynamics while maintaining the speed of the mc approach . for the present study ,",
    "we are encouraged by our earlier results presented in @xcite which suggest that in _ realistic _ gcs",
    "the bhs might actually never decouple from the cluster on the whole , in which case a mc approach is appropriate .",
    "using the results of the calibration as described in section  [ methodnbody ] , we have calculated the dynamical evolution of 42 cluster models with a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "all models are initialized as king models @xcite , with stellar masses chosen in the range @xmath47 according to the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite , which is a broken power - law of the form @xmath48 , with @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "once the single stars are drawn from the imf , we randomly choose @xmath53 stars to be the primary member of a binary ( where @xmath53 is the total number of primordial binaries ) .",
    "the secondary masses are drawn from a distribution that is uniform in the mass ratio within the range @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the primary star mass .",
    "the semi - major axes of the binaries are chosen from a distribution flat in @xmath56 , where the hardest binary has @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the radii of the binary components , and the softest binary is within the local hard - soft boundary ( i.e. , all primordial binaries are initially hard ) .",
    "the binary eccentricities are chosen from the thermal distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we vary the initial number of stars ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ) , the initial king concentration parameter ( @xmath63 , 5 , 7 ) and the galactocentric distance @xmath64 , which in our models corresponds to three different metallicities ( @xmath65 at @xmath66 kpc , @xmath67 at @xmath68 kpc and @xmath69 at @xmath70 kpc ) .",
    "the choice to vary metallicity as a function of @xmath64 was motivated by the observations of the milky way gc population , which show a correlation between @xmath64 and @xmath71 , with larger metallicities being found closer to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "these initial conditions form a @xmath72 grid of 27 cluster models .",
    "each of these models has initial virial radius @xmath73 pc and binary fraction @xmath74% .",
    "we will call these 27 models our _ standard models _ , and name them according to the values of the three parameters @xmath7 , @xmath75 , and @xmath64 ( e.g. ` n8w5rg20 ` has @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath70 kpc , with metallicity @xmath78 set by @xmath64 ) .",

    "the bh mass spectrum depends significantly on the metallicity assumed . in the @xcite remnant prescription",
    "used here the bh masses range from @xmath19 for @xmath78 and @xmath18 , but at higher metallicities ( @xmath65 here ) , mass loss from stronger stellar winds causes the upper end of the bh mass function to be truncated at about 20  @xmath89 . for @xmath18 , about 36% of the bhs are formed through partial fallback , and only these bhs receive natal kicks .",
    "the rest of the bhs are formed through direct collapse .",
    "we start by describing the qualitative evolution common to all of our cluster models , and in later sections we describe in more detail the properties of the retained and ejected bh populations , as well as observable cluster properties . in what follows ,",
    "whenever it is reasonable to show the results for all of our models we do so , but for cases when this is not possible , we have chosen three pairs of models ( each with different @xmath7 ) that are identical except for one parameter , to allow us to see the effect that the virial radius , the binary fraction , and the galactocentric distance together with metallicity , have on our results .",
    "the pairs of models we selected are ` n2w5rg8 ` and ` n2-b ` ( @xmath90  pc and @xmath83  pc ) , ` n8w5rg8 ` and ` n8-e ` ( @xmath91 and @xmath86 ) , and ` n16w7rg2 ` and ` n16w7rg20 ` ( @xmath66  kpc with @xmath65 and @xmath70  kpc with @xmath78 ) .    most of the bhs form within about 10  myr and promptly begin to sink due to dynamical friction against the lower - mass background stars .",
    "the timescale for segregation of a bh from the half - mass radius to the core is @xmath92 @xcite where @xmath28 is the average stellar mass , @xmath93 is the mass of the bh , and @xmath94  gyr is the half - mass relaxation time . since this timescale is dependent on @xmath93 , the most massive bhs tend to sink the fastest , driving a central collapse .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : lagrad ] , which shows the lagrange radii for the six representative models . by looking at the lagrange radii separately for the bhs ( solid lines ) and for the non - bhs ( dotted lines )",
    ", we see a clear separation of these two populations , with the bhs becoming more centrally concentrated than the lower - mass stars . a small subset ( about 1% ) of",

    "the other 99% of the bh mass remains confined to roughly the same region for all time as the rest of the cluster slowly expands .",

    ", the bhs segregate from the lower - mass stars , forming a _ short - lived _ cusp of mostly bhs . in the deepest part of the collapse , the central @xmath96 objects are _ all _ bhs .",

    "these core oscillations occur frequently , anywhere from @xmath98 times over 12  gyr , depending on the model ( see figure  [ fig : lagrad ] ) .",
    "the frequency and depth of the oscillations both depend on @xmath7 ( i.e. , deeper and more frequent for larger @xmath7 ) .",
    "the oscillations also tend decrease in frequency and become more shallow over time . following the initial phase of bh segregation and rapid ejection ( up to about a gyr ) ,",
    "the number of oscillations per gyr decreases from as many as a few tens per gyr ( from 12 gyr ) down to just a few per gyr near the end .",
    "we show the evolution of the total number of bhs present in each model in figure  [ fig : ret_bhs_time ] .",
    "we see most of the bhs forming up to about 10  myr , as expected , and then after about 100  myr , once the most massive bhs have segregated , the number of bhs starts to decrease as they are ejected through strong binary encounters in the core .",
    "the number of bhs continues to decrease all the way to 12  gyr , but the rate slows down over time .",
    "the majority of our low- , intermediate- , and large-@xmath7 models end with roughly 50100 bhs , 400800 bhs , and 10002000 bhs , respectively . while larger-@xmath7 models have more bhs at 12  gyr than lower-@xmath7 models , they also eject a greater number of bhs in total .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass_time ] shows the evolution of total cluster mass for all models .",
    "after a period of rapid mass loss driven by early stellar evolution of massive stars , the cluster mass loss rate tends to slow continually over time .",
    "most of our models lose about half of their mass by 12  gyr , but the most compact clusters ( with initial @xmath99pc ) and those at the smallest galactocentric distances ( @xmath66  kpc ) , which have the smallest tidal radii , lose mass at faster rates .",
    "in fact , among our low-@xmath7 models , the three with @xmath66  kpc ( ` n2w5rg2 , n2w5rg2 , n2w7rg2 ` ) nearly completely evaporate within about 6  gyr ( dotted lines in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : mass_time ] ) , and the model with @xmath83  pc ( ` n2-b ` ) has lost more than 80% of its mass by the end of the simulation . the mass loss rate does not change significantly over the range @xmath100  kpc .",
    "the final structural properties for all of our models are shown in table  [ table : final_properties ] .",

    "the initial bh mass spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : bh_mass_functions ] , and aside from the normalization , the only factor that significantly affects the mass function is the metallicity @xmath71 . since massive and metal - rich stars lose more mass via stellar winds , they form less massive bhs than do lower metallicity stars ( see lower right panel ) .",
    "our models retain between @xmath101 of the bhs _ initially _ , depending primarily on @xmath64 ( and @xmath71 ) and @xmath81 .",
    "the reason for the @xmath64 and @xmath71 dependence of the initial retention fraction is twofold : first , a bh with a given position and kick speed will escape more easily from the cluster with the smaller tidal radius . additionally , since models with smaller @xmath64 also have larger @xmath71 , the bhs produced have lower masses and will therefore tend to receive stronger kicks , making these objects even more likely to be ejected upon formation .",
    "more compact clusters ( small @xmath81 ) can retain initially formed bhs more easily .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ret_bhs_binaries ] we show the distribution of single and binary bhs as a function of time for our six representative models . here",
    "we see that almost all of the retained bhs remain as single stars throughout the cluster evolution , in agreement with our earlier results @xcite .",
    "there are usually no more than a few tens of bh binaries of any type inside the clusters at any given time , and are usually made up of comparable numbers of bh  bh and bh  non - bh binaries .",
    "a larger supply of primordial binaries does provide more opportunities for bhs to exchange into binaries through dynamical interactions and so we see a slightly larger number of bh binaries in models with larger @xmath80 .",
    "this effect can be seen in the center panels in figure  [ fig : ret_bhs_binaries ] , where we compare model ` n8-e ` ( @xmath102 , right ) to model ` n8w5rg8 ` ( @xmath91 , left ) .",
    "since most of the primordial binary population consists of two low - mass stars initially ( which will never become bhs ) , the number of bh  non - bh binaries is most affected by the primordial binary fraction .",
    "the other parameters seem to have only a minor effect on the number of bh binaries in clusters .",
    "the final retained bh mass distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : bh_mass_functions ] along with the initially retained population , for comparison . since the most massive bhs segregate the deepest they also interact the most frequently , and therefore tend to be the first to be ejected . over time",
    ", the maximum bh mass in the cluster is reduced from about @xmath103 initially down to about @xmath104 at 12  gyr .",
    "many of our models still contain a substantial population of @xmath105 bhs at 12  gyr .",
    "the fraction of ( initially retained ) bhs that are retained all the way to 12  gyr depends strongly on @xmath7 . for our largest-@xmath7 clusters ,",
    "the final retention fraction @xmath106 is typically about 50% , and for the lowest-@xmath7 clusters",
    "@xmath106 is only about 20% ( except for the special case of model ` n2-b ` , which we will discuss separately ) .",
    "since the initial number of bhs _ and _ the final bh retention fraction both scale with @xmath7 , the final _ number _ of bhs grows faster than linearly with @xmath7 .",
    "the final properties of the populations of retained and ejected bhs for each model are given in table  [ table : bhs ] .",
    "looking back to figure  [ fig : ret_bhs_time ] we see that models with smaller @xmath64 retain fewer bhs at 12  gyr , but this is primarily because they retained fewer bhs _",
    "initially_. although larger primordial binary fractions produce a slightly larger number of bhs in binaries , this has little impact on the final number of retained bhs .",
    "for example , comparing models with @xmath107 and @xmath85 and 50% ( ` n16-d ` and ` n16-e ` ) , the final number of retained bhs at 12 gyr is 1512 and 1556 , respectively ( see table  [ table : bhs ] for details ) .",
    "rather , it seems that three - body binaries play a much more significant role in overall bh evaporation ( although , as we will show later , the binary fraction does impact the number of ejected bh  non - bh binaries , as well as the number of in - cluster bh  bh mergers ) . by far",
    ", the initial virial radius has the greatest impact on the bh evaporation rate for models with a given @xmath7 .",
    "more compact clusters with smaller @xmath81 are more dense , and so they process their bhs at a faster rate and therefore end with significantly fewer bhs ( compare the yellow and blue curves on each panel on the right hand side of figure  [ fig : ret_bhs_time ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since the massive bhs are depleted to a greater extent , the remaining population is composed of bhs with comparatively low masses .",
    "the model with the fewest bhs remaining at 12  gyr is ` n2-b ` , our low-@xmath7 model with @xmath83 pc , which has just 9 bhs at 12  gyr , or @xmath106= 2% ( compared to 135 bhs for model ` n2-c ` with @xmath84 pc , but same initial conditions otherwise ) .",
    "we see a similar trend in bh retention in our more massive cluster models , but the contrast is not quite as stark ( 269 bhs retained in model ` n8-b ` compared to 852 in model ` n8-c ` ; 869 bhs retained in model ` n16-b ` compared to 1988 in model ` n16-c ` ) .",

    "the ejected bhs too are mostly single . in order to eject a bh binary",
    ", it typically has to participate in multiple binary interactions in order to harden enough that the recoil from some final interaction is sufficient to remove it from the cluster entirely .",
    "the binaries that are ejected , therefore , are most often bh  bh binaries , since through many strong interactions , any low - mass non - bh binary companions will be preferentially replaced by bhs .",

    "we find that most of the ( small number of ) bh  non - bh binary ejections happen early , at the time of formation of the bh , rather than through subsequent dynamics .",
    "most models have many more b - s interactions than b - b interactions , since with @xmath91 there are many more single stars than binaries , but with @xmath86 , there are about equal numbers of b - s and b - b interactions . in models with large binary fractions ( e.g. , center right panel in figure  [ fig : binint ] ) , the number of bh  non - bh ejections is greater than in models with fewer binaries , but they still occur primarily at bh formation .",

    "we see that in the high metallicity cluster ( left ) , fewer bh  non - bh binaries are ejected upon bh formation , and instead are mostly ejected dynamically .",
    "this makes sense considering that the the lower - mass bhs produced at high metallicities will receive larger birth kicks , which will unbind ( rather than eject ) more of these binaries when the bh is formed .",
    "additionally , low - mass bhs will also be more likely to interact with normal low - mass stars over time , which explains why this model ejects more bh  non - bh binaries through dynamics than in some other models .",

    "in fact , for @xmath60 and @xmath76 , the models with smaller virial radii actually eject _ fewer _ bh  non - bh binaries than those with larger virial radii .",
    "since most of the bh  non - bh binaries are ejected at the time of bh formation rather than through dynamics , we should not expect the rate of these ejections to increase with the higher interaction rates occurring in more compact clusters .    in figure",

    "we show the masses of the components ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) of bh  bh binaries ejected from all models .",

    "this follows from the fact that it is easier to eject a binary from a less massive cluster due to its lower escape speed , therefore most of these binaries get ejected before they have a chance to tighten to sub - au separations . on the right panel we show the semi - major axis and the companion mass for the 227 ejected binaries containing a bh with a non - compact stellar companion .",
    "recall that most of these binaries are ejected within about 10 myr , which is why the majority of these systems have massive companions that have not yet evolved into compact objects ( note that once ejected , these objects are no longer evolved ) .",
    "there is no obvious trend with @xmath7 , but there is a weak correlation between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , with the binaries containing more massive companions tending to have slightly larger separations .",
    "the dynamics that leads to bh evaporation also produces very tight bh ",
    "bh binaries , many of which merge within the 12  gyr .",
    "these mergers can either occur while the binary is still bound to the cluster or in the field after being ejected .",
    "for all of our models combined , we produce 4096 merging systems over the 12  gyr of evolution . of these mergers ,",
    "about 85% occur post - ejection in the field and the other 15% occur inside clusters .",
    "nearly 71% of the mergers are produced in the large-@xmath7 models , about 26% in the intermediate-@xmath7 models , and just under 3% in the lowest-@xmath7 models .",
    "the numbers of mergers per model are given in table  [ table : bhs ] .",
    "the strong @xmath7-dependence of the merger rate is caused by two effects .",
    "first , we saw that more massive clusters processed more bhs , and therefore ejected a greater number of bh  bh binaries .",
    "also , since more massive clusters tend to eject _",
    "tighter _ binaries , it turns out that a greater fraction of the ejected binaries actually merge within 12  gyr .",
    "the binary fraction has the next biggest impact of the merger rate , enhancing the rate of post - ejection mergers slightly , but dramatically increasing the rate of in - cluster mergers ( going from @xmath97 to @xmath113 binaries , the number of in - cluster mergers for our models increases from 0 to 8 , 0 to 56 , and 3 to 156 , in order of lowest to highest @xmath7 ) .",
    "this means that it is not only dynamically formed hard three - body binaries that produce bh ",
    "bh mergers , but also bh  bh binaries that form and harden through b - b and b - s interactions . just over @xmath114 of the mergers occur within the first gyr ( about 1700 mergers ) , and the rate per gyr decreases dramatically over time , with only about 100 mergers occurring over the last gyr .",
    "if we assume that our models describe the mw gcs reasonably well , we can make a very crude estimate of the present - day merger rate by extrapolating to the current total population of about 150 gcs .",
    "multiplying our merger rate ( 100 gyr@xmath23 during the last gyr ) for @xmath115 models by a factor of 3 ( to get 150 clusters ) gives us a total merger rate of @xmath116 per mweg per myr .",
    "this crude estimate agrees with the merger rate that we calculated previously @xcite , although that rate was averaged over 12  gyr , which is clearly not reasonable considering how the merger rate decreases over time .",
    "here we use only the mergers that occurred in the last gyr , making it more appropriate for representing the current merger rate from @xmath11 gyr old gc systems .",
    "this is comparable to the",
    " realistic \" merger rate from primordial binaries in galactic fields reported in @xcite , however other more recent studies have predicted both higher @xcite and lower @xcite field merger rates .",
    "our estimate is still far too crude to accurately predict the true merger rates from populations of gcs , especially since we see such extreme differences in merger rate across our models .",
    "ideally , the merger rate calculation should factor in how good of a fit our models are to the mw gc population and then weigh the contribution from each model accordingly .      in order to know whether our models are a good representation of reality we must compare observable properties for our models to those of real galactic gcs .",
    "among these key observable properties are the core radius ( @xmath117 ) , the ratio of the core radius to the half - light radius ( @xmath118 ) , the central ( 3d ) luminosity density ( @xmath119 ) , and the total cluster mass ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "we calculate these four values for each of our models at the final time of 12  gyr , except for the three models that evaporated prior to 12  gyr , which are not included in the following analysis .",
    "since the cluster mass is a straightforward quantity in our models , here we do the simplest thing and report our theoretical total cluster mass , which is the sum of the masses of all the individual stars , including dark remnants .",
    "the other three quantities are much more sensitive to the distribution of dark versus luminous stars , and so we must do a bit more work to obtain values that can reasonably be compared to the ones that observers would actually calculate . since observations of gcs are generally in the @xmath121-band , we start by converting the bolometric luminosity for each star as given by bse to @xmath121-band luminosities using the standard stellar library of @xcite . from there , the half - light radius @xmath122 is simply the radius that encloses half of the light ( in the @xmath121-band ) .",
    "the core radius is a less straightforward quantity , but one that is important for its use in identifying the dynamical state of a gc .",
    "there are many different definitions of the core radius , and the resulting values can vary by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the core of a cluster is the central region over which the density and velocity dispersion are roughly constant .",
    "more quantitatively , the core radius is sometimes defined as the radius at which the surface luminosity density drops to half the central value . to calculate @xmath117",
    ", observers generally construct a surface brightness profile ( sbp ) , and then measure where the density drops to half the central value .",
    "alternatively , a king model can be fit directly to the sbp .",
    "both of these techniques require radial binning of the stars , which introduces noise ( since bright stars are rare ) and arbitrariness ( choosing a magnitude cutoff to remove brightest stars , choosing the bin size ) . in order to eliminate the need for binning and to smooth out the noise associated with small numbers of bright stars , we have instead opted to use a new and straightforward approach for calculating @xmath117 that uses the _ cumulative _ luminosity profile . to this",
    "we fit the integrated form of a king density profile , and extract the best fit value of @xmath117 .",
    "we find that this function provides an excellent fit to the integrated light profiles of our models .",
    "we describe our technique in more detail in the appendix .",
    "finally we calculate the 3d central luminosity density , @xmath123 ( in units of @xmath124/pc@xmath125 ) within two different fractions of the core radius , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . for comparison , we have also calculated @xmath117 using the bolometric luminosities output by our code , and from a sbp constructed for each of our models using a technique similar to that in @xcite .",
    "we find that the different techniques produce reasonable agreement , and we do not find any systematic bias in the values obtained via these three different methods .",
    "we show the cumulative luminosity profiles and sbps for our six representative models in the appendix .",
    "the observable properties for all models are given in table  [ table : observables ] .    [ !",
    "t ]    in figure  [ fig : gc_comparison ] we compare @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath123 , and @xmath128 for our models to the actual values observed in mw gcs . all the galactic gc data is taken from the @xcite catalog ( 2010 edition ) , except for the total cluster mass , which is from @xcite .",
    "the properties of the mw gcs are represented as histograms , and the colored tick marks indicate the final values for our models .",
    "our @xmath76 models produce final clusters with roughly the median gc mass of about @xmath129 , and with our three different choices for @xmath7 , the models span most of the range of mw gc masses . to model the largest mw clusters , we will have to extend our initial @xmath7 to larger values .",

    "although it is not apparent from figure  [ fig : gc_comparison ] , we can see in table  [ table : observables ] that there are few correlations between cluster initial conditions and final core radii .",

    "this would be expected in models with _ either _ a smaller @xmath64 , which are more tidally truncated , and hence kept more compact , _ or _ with higher @xmath71 , since they produce lower - mass bhs , which have less of an impact on the cluster , and therefore allow the cores to contract more than when more massive bhs are present .",
    "we do not find any significant correlation between core radius and binary fraction .",
    "the final overall binary fractions ( see table  [ table : final_properties ] ) are , in most cases , similar to the initial values , while in a few of our models the _ core _ binary fraction , @xmath135 , increases over time .",
    "this result is in agreement with numerical calculations by @xcite , and is attributed to an imbalance of mass segregation of binaries into the core , and destruction of binaries through strong dynamical encounters ( mass segregation wins out ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fb ] , we show the time evolution of the overall binary fraction and the binary fraction within the 10% and 50% lagrange radii for two models that display contrasting behavior . in model",
    "` n2-b ` ( top panel ) , the inner binary fraction increases steadily over time starting at around @xmath136gyr , at which point the cluster has already ejected about 42% of its bhs ; 85% of the bhs are ejected by 6 gyr .",
    "once the bulk of the bhs , especially the most massive ones , are lost , normal stellar binaries , which are much less massive than typical bhs , finally begin to segregate inward . by the end of the simulation , the binary fraction within the 10% mass bin has more than doubled . moreover , the 50% and the overall binary fractions begin to increase in the last few gyr .",
    "this is likely because of significant tidal stripping on this low - mass cluster ( @xmath137 at 12 gyr ) , which will preferentially remove single stars , now that the binaries have started to segregate inward .    _ _ [ fig : fb ]    we do not , however , see the trend of increasing core binary fraction in all models . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : fb ] , we show the evolution of the binary fractions for model ` n16w7rg20 ` , all of which actually decrease with time , even within the central 10% lagrange radius . in fact , in many of our larger-@xmath7 models , or in clusters that have longer relaxation times for other reasons ( e.g. , larger virial radius ) , the trend of increasing central binary fraction is less significant or not present at all ( on the timescale of the simulations ) .",
    "we expect the timescale for segregation of binaries to scale with relaxation time , but in our models it may have more to do with the presence of large numbers of bhs . as discussed by @xcite , the heating caused by a retained population of bhs can quench mass segregation of other objects ( e.g. , binaries ) that would have otherwise experienced significant mass segregation within a few gyr .",
    "this is similar to the case of an intermediate - mass bh quenching mass segregation by scattering stars out of the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as long as the bhs are dominating the central dynamics , as is the case for most of our models , they seem to play a role in preventing segregation of binaries into the core .    excluding the clusters that dissolved within a few gyr",

    "our goal here was to study the evolution of massive star clusters that initially retain most of their bhs in order to see whether it is possible for many bhs to remain after @xmath139gyr and still have cluster properties consistent with those of mw gcs .",
    "most of our clusters do indeed retain many bhs at the end of the simulations ( up to @xmath2 , for initial @xmath7 from @xmath140 ) , but the agreement with observable properties of mw gcs is not perfect .",
    "qualitatively , all of our models evolve quite similarly , at least during the first few gyr .",
    "the bhs quickly become very centrally concentrated , but , as a whole remain spread out over about a parsec in radius , similar to the innermost @xmath141 of the non - bh mass . at the very center ,",
    "the most massive bhs drive repeated core oscillations where a few tens of bhs collapse into a cusp , but then promptly re - expand via their own dynamics after forming three - body binaries . single and binary bhs are ejected over time , with the most massive bhs being ejected first , followed by the less massive ones .",
    "as this happens , the remaining population of lower - mass bhs becomes less efficient at driving deep core collapses and the outer envelope of the oscillating central @xmath97 bh mass slowly expands .",
    "this results in a lower central density and a gradual slowing of both the interaction rate and the bh ejection rate .",
    "while most models still have a significant population of @xmath142 bhs at the end , we find that this depends sensitively on the initial conditions , in particular quantities that have the potential to significantly modify the cluster relaxation time , such as @xmath7 and @xmath81 .",
    "clusters with shorter relaxation times ( lower @xmath7 , smaller @xmath81 ) process their bhs more quickly , and therefore end up retaining smaller fractions of their initial bh populations by 12 gyr .",
    "the mass of the most massive bound bh depends on the extent to which the bhs have been depleted .",
    "model ` n2-b ` has the smallest @xmath7 ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath81 ( 1 pc ) , and therefore the shortest relaxation time of all , and it retains just 9 bhs at 12  gyr ( about 2% of the initially retained bhs ) .",
    "similarly , models ` n8-b ` and ` n16-b ` ( larger @xmath7 , but @xmath83 pc ) retain the fewest bhs among other models with the same @xmath7 .",
    "our models have final binary fractions that agree very well with observation .",
    "the total masses and luminosity densities for our models also fit well within the parameter space of observed mw clusters .",
    "our final core radii , however , are for the most part too large to represent the bulk of mw clusters , although they do fall along the extended tail of the distribution . like the dynamics of the bhs ,",
    "the final core radii too are affected significantly by the initial virial radius .",
    "all models with @xmath90 pc have final core radii between @xmath144 pc , and those with @xmath84 pc have even larger cores ( @xmath145 pc ) , regardless of @xmath7",
    ". the only models to eventually contract down to core sizes smaller than 2  pc are the three that _ start _ much more compactly with @xmath83 pc .",
    "these models all reach a point at which the bhs are providing so little energy that the cluster as a whole stops expanding , or in the case of model ` n2-b ` , actually starts contracting ( see figure  [ fig : lagrad ] ) , as the remaining low - mass bhs start to lose their dominance at the cluster center . in the last few gyr of evolution in model ` n2-b ` the bhs become more and more integrated with the rest of the cluster , and finally the cluster core ( i.e. , the _ observational _ core , composed of luminous stars ) starts to contract , resulting in a final core size of just 0.5 pc .",
    "this model has a mass of only @xmath146 at 12  gyr , placing it at the very bottom of the mw gc mass distribution .",
    "in fact , the three most compact clusters lose mass at a faster rate overall than the comparable model with larger @xmath81 , and also end with fewer bhs and smaller cores , indicating that bh evaporation seems to be tied very closely to _ cluster _ evaporation .",
    "however , models ` n8-b ` and ` n16-b ` each have about the same final mass as the model ` n8w5rg2 ` and ` n16w5rg2 ` , respectively ( which have @xmath90 pc , but smaller tidal radii ) yet being more compact , they still eject their bhs more efficiently and therefore achieve smaller core sizes in the end .",
    "each of our models forms and ejects many bh binaries over the course of their evolution , but the majority of the bhs , both retained and ejected , are single bhs .",
    "most of the ejected binaries are bh ",
    "bh , but some bh  non - bh binaries are ejected as well . the number of ejected bh binaries , their properties at ejection , and therefore the number of subsequent bh  bh mergers ( inside and outside of the clusters ) depend primarily on @xmath7 and @xmath81 .",
    "we produce many bh  bh mergers ( more than 4000 in total ) , with at least one merger produced in each cluster .",
    "roughly 60% of the ejected bh ",
    "bh binaries actually merge within a hubble time ( we do not calculate this fraction for retained bh ",
    "bh binaries because their properties are still being modified by dynamics ) .",
    "since our models do not yet show great agreement with all relevant properties of galactic gcs , we can not yet make any reliable quantitative predictions about the numbers of interesting bh binary systems in our galaxy , or other similar galaxies .",
    "@xcite were the first to suggest that the dynamics of a population of bhs is actually regulated by the _ cluster _ , and that for this reason bhs can be retained for much longer than previously thought .",
    "in their simplified two - component cluster models they found that the bhs behave such that they meet the energy needs of the cluster , similar to the way that primordial binaries balance energy flow during the binary - burning phase @xcite .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have demonstrated that the interactions ( and subsequently the ejections ) of a segregated population of bhs can inject enough heat to cause significant core expansion in clusters .",
    "@xcite find that some point , however , there are too few bhs to balance the energy lost via relaxation , and only then can the cluster finally approach the phase that the authors call _ second core collapse _ , to distinguish it from the initial bh - driven collapse ( _ second _ core collapse therefore refers to what is usually just called _ core collapse _ ) .",
    "if the _ cluster _ drives the rate of energy flow , we should not expect the bhs to evaporate within a few cluster relaxation times .",
    "our results agree with this basic picture , and we see this very behavior play out in our model ` n2-b ` , which is actually approaching the second core collapse phase by the end of the simulation .",
    "all of our models display many deep collapses of a small number of bhs , but the formation of three - body binaries and their subsequent interactions ultimately power the re - expansion of the cusp .",
    "we find that the bhs actually spend _ most _ of their time in the _ uncollapsed _ state , which also helps to explain how it is possible for bhs to remain in clusters for so long .",
    "the bhs _ try _ to decouple via the spitzer instability , but their own dynamics ensures that they always re - couple to the cluster very quickly .",
    "@xcite also discuss the dependence of bh retention on relaxation time by comparing models of four clusters with very different initial conditions ( modeled after m4 , ngc  6397 , 47  tuc and m22 ) .",
    "the m4 and ngc  6397 models both have short relaxation times , and although they retain nearly all the bhs _ initially _ , they eject almost all of them within 12  gyr . in contrast , the 47  tuc and m22 models start with only 10% of the formed bhs initially , yet given their longer relaxation timescales most of these bhs still remain at 12  gyr",
    ". the difference , they explain , is that the models are in different dynamical states : the former two models have reached the second core collapse phase , while the latter two are far from it .",
    "they predict that clusters with long relaxation times are more likely to still contain many bhs at present .",
    "we have shown that this is true for our models as well , but to make the point more clearly we show in figure  [ fig : bhfrac_vs_n ] the relationship between the final fraction of bhs retained and the final number of bound stars for our models .",
    "this shows that the trend predicted by @xcite holds roughly for a wide range of initial conditions , although the variety of initial conditions also leads to the large amount of scatter .",
    "t ]    while these studies ( as well as our own ) agree that bh dynamics is regulated for the most part by the cluster , there are still uncertainties about initial bh populations in gcs that may impact the precise evolutionary timescale for bh evaporation , and therefore predictions for present - day clusters .",
    "the bh mass spectrum ( derived from the remnant - to - progenitor mass relationship and the upper end of the stellar imf ) is somewhat uncertain . since the most massive bhs",
    "are ejected first , and the impact of bhs on the cluster lessens with time as bhs are ejected , the bh mass spectrum could significantly affect the long - term evolution of bhs and clusters .",
    "another key uncertainty is the magnitude of birth kicks for bhs .",
    "studies attempting to constrain bh kick strengths using observations of bh xrbs have led to mixed conclusions .",
    "@xcite suggested that large kicks ( similar to those of nss ) were necessary to explain the spatial distribution of bh xrbs in the galaxy , while other studies have found that lower natal kick velocities better explain the properties of at least some specific systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are also competing theories for the origin of these kicks ( e.g. , neutrino - driven versus supernova - driven ) which lead to different predictions for the magnitudes that we should expect for bhs ( see summary in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented a new kick model that might explain how bhs could acquire kicks similar to those of nss .",
    "the model suggests that asymmetric supernova ejecta could lead to an acceleration of the remnant bh gravitationally in the same direction as the initial kick , in which case the kick momentum",
    "_ grows _ with bh mass .",
    "recent models of m22 presented in @xcite and @xcite found good agreement with observable properties of m22 by starting with very small initial retention fractions ( 10% , or about 50 bhs ) , under the assumption that bhs receive the same kicks as nss . for comparison , we have repeated 3 simulations ( ` n2w5rg8 ` , ` n8w5rg8 ` , and ` n16w5rg8 ` ) , except we allowed bhs to receive kicks identical to those of nss ( kick chosen independent of mass or fallback ) . as expected , we find that very few bhs are retained initially ( 0 , 6 , and 31 , for the three models , respectively ) , and they have little effect on their host clusters .",
    "it seems that such a small number of bhs can not power the deep collapses that we have seen in the simulations described in this work .",
    "this also helps to explain how these models that retained just 6 and 31 bhs initially , still managed to keep 5 and 19 of them ( respectively ) all the way to 12 gyr , since bh ejections tend to occur predominantly during the deep collapse phases , which are absent from the models with very few bhs .",
    "however , since the goal of this work is to better understand the evolution of clusters that retain most of their bhs initially , and to determine to what extent these clusters resemble our galactic gcs , we have chosen to focus on the effects of varying _ only _ the initial conditions of the cluster models as a whole , and have left the initial bh populations fixed , except for the differences that arise naturally from different choices for cluster parameters",
    ". the effect of bh kicks and the bh mass spectrum will be the topic of a future study .    with the growing evidence for bh xrbs in old gcs",
    ", it would also be interesting to use our models to predict the numbers and properties of bh xrbs in gcs .",
    "however , we can not trust our simple treatment of binary stellar evolution to predict the behavior of these binaries . this would require more focused binary evolution and mass transfer modeling of specific systems that form in our cluster models . a very crude analysis of the entire population of retained bh binaries with non - compact companions at 12 gyr indicates that at least some of these systems ( 28 , or about 13% ) could potentially be interesting x - ray sources at present .",
    "since we use the standard  sticky sphere \" approximation for physical collisions , our code is also not capable of predicting detailed outcomes of collisions between bhs and non - compact stars .",
    "our standard treatment leads effectively to the entire mass of the colliding objects to be entirely and immediately accreted onto the bh , ignoring completely any feedback effects ( which could lead to significant mass loss ) or the finite timescale of the accretion flow .",
    "our code can , however , predict the _ rates _ of these collisions and as a quick test we have checked how many collisions occur between bhs and non - degenerate stars in one of our large-@xmath7 models ( ` n16w5rg8 ` ) . in total",
    "there were 45 direct collisions involving a bh and a non - degenerate star , which occurred via different kinds of interactions : 23 occurred as direct s - s collisions , 18 during strong b - s interactions , and 4 during b - b interactions .",
    "most of these collisions were with main - sequence stars ( 40 ) , but there were also a few collisions with giants ( 5 ) , which , if treated in more detail would have likely led to the formation of a compact bh ",
    "wd binary remnant @xcite .",
    "about half of the collisions happen within the first gyr , and the rate declines after that .",
    "we also see 21 evolutionary mergers between a bh and a non - degenerate star , which occurred during binary stellar evolution rather than during dynamical encounters .",
    "all of these mergers were with ms stars , and they all occurred within the first 13  myr .",
    "we have not yet studied the details of these collisions and mergers , but it would be interesting to look at their properties , such as impact parameter and stellar masses , and then predict the possible observable outcomes of such events , as they could produce transient sources that would be detectable by surveys such as lsst @xcite .",
    "perhaps most importantly , on the computational side , since we find that cusps involving a few tens of bhs form repeatedly in our models , we must ask whether an orbit - averaged mc approach can model this dynamical behavior accurately .",
    "in particular , for a small-@xmath7 decoupled subsystem , the relaxation and dynamical timescales can become comparable , in which case the fokker - planck approximation , a key assumption in the mc technique , breaks down .",
    "furthermore , such a small number of particles makes the estimation of local averages highly susceptible to poisson fluctuations , which directly influences the accuracy of all dynamical calculations .",
    "the direct @xmath7-body technique does not suffer from these issues , and so it can handle the dynamics of a small-@xmath7 system quite naturally .",
    "this is most likely responsible for the difference in core radius between the two methods that was noted in figure [ fig:2species64k ] . in a bh - driven collapse ,",
    "the small number of massive particles interact on a much shorter timescale than our relaxation timestep can resolve . in order to address this",
    ", we are currently developing a new technique that will allow us to model the dynamics of these deep collapses more accurately .",
    "this hybrid @xmath7-body / monte carlo technique integrates the dynamics of the bhs ( or other massive particles ) directly with an @xmath7-body integrator , while the majority of lower - mass stars in the halo and core interact via the two - body relaxation of the mc approach .",
    "preliminary results indicate that this technique achieves similar speed to a pure mc simulation while producing core radii that agree with results observed in full @xmath7-body simulations @xcite .      starting with reasonable initial conditions describing young star clusters",
    "we have presented many simulations of gcs containing populations of hundreds to thousands of bhs . without any fine tuning of parameters",
    ", we find that our models have present - day observable properties that are consistent with the mw gcs , although our core radii are slightly large .",
    "our main conclusion is that _ if _ most bhs are retained initially , it seems that the only way to still eject most or all bhs by @xmath147gyr is to start with very compact clusters .",
    "if clusters can eject enough bhs , then the core can finally begin to contract , producing final core radii that may be in better agreement with those observed in mw clusters .",
    "most of our models , on the other hand , retain significant numbers of bhs all the way to 12  gyr ( typically @xmath148 for our lowest-@xmath7 models , and @xmath149 for our largest-@xmath7 models ) , and have rather large cores ( typically about 25 pc ) .",
    "we confirm that the bh evaporation timescale is set by the cluster evolutionary timescale as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that the bhs drive deep core oscillations during which a small number of bhs can form a steep cusp , but these always re - expand and re - mix with the other stars very quickly , and the result is that most of the time the bhs are in their uncollapsed state , well mixed with other stars .",
    "we suggest that this may explain why the bhs mostly avoid the spitzer instability , and hence why they can be retained for much longer timescales than previously thought",
    ".    it will be important to test the effect of uncertain stellar parameters , especially those pertaining to the bh populations , such as bh birth kick magnitudes and the bh mass  progenitor mass relationship , which we have not explored in this study .",
    "these parameters will undoubtably affect the subsequent dynamics of the bhs and the clusters as a whole , and may therefore also change the predictions for bh retention .",
    "if it turns out that bhs do indeed get kicks of the same magnitude as nss and so at most only @xmath11% are retained initially , then the very compact initial conditions might not be necessary to produce small cores by @xmath150  gyr , since there would be far fewer bhs to eject before the core could start to contract .    in order to derive the proper bh ",
    "bh merger rate for mw - equivalent galaxies ( and the corresponding predicted ligo detection rate ) we will first need to run additional simulations in order to fill in the gaps where we currently have poor coverage in the parameter space of observed mw gcs .",
    "we will then be able to do a detailed statistical calculation that weighs the contribution from each of our models according to how well their properties match the mw population",
    ". this calculation will be the topic of a forthcoming paper ( rodriguez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "to make a sbp requires the stars to be binned radially .",
    "the bins should be small enough in radius that the core is resolved .",
    "the tradeoff is that small bin sizes increase the random noise , since a single bright star can dominate the light for an individual bin , introducing large bin - to - bin variations . to get around this",
    ", observers generally remove the brightest stars before calculating the sbp @xcite based on a somewhat arbitrary choice of a magnitude cutoff . a detailed discussion and comparison of various techniques can be found in @xcite .    to avoid the complications of binning",
    ", we have chosen to use a new technique for calculating the core radius .",
    "our technique involves fitting a king model to the _ cumulative _ luminosity function , which is much smoother than the luminosity density ( or surface brightness profile ) because it does not require us to bin the stars .",
    "we start with the analytic approximation to the king model density profile ( equation  13 from @xcite ) , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the central 2d surface density and @xmath117 is the king core radius .",
    "we then integrate this equation over the surface area out to some distance @xmath153 , so that it is now represents the _ cumulative _ luminosity as a function of @xmath153 , @xmath154 finally , we fit this equation to the cumulative luminosity profile for each of our models to find the best values for @xmath152 and @xmath117 .    all core radii given in columns  2 and  6 of table  [ table : observables ] are calculated using this technique , based on either the bolometric or the v - band luminosities .",
    "we show the cumulative luminosity profiles and the sbps for a sample of six of our models in figure  [ fig : core_radii ] .",

    "<S> this is in contrast to previous theoretical expectations that most black holes should be ejected dynamically within a few gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by black holes ( through the spitzer `` mass segregation instability '' ) is easily reverted through three - body processes , and involves only a small number of the most massive black holes , while lower - mass black holes remain well - mixed with ordinary stars far from the central cusp . </S>",
    "<S> thus the rapid segregation of stellar black holes does not lead to a long - term physical separation of most black holes into a dynamically decoupled inner core , as often assumed previously . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the recent detections of several black hole x - ray binary candidates in galactic globular clusters , our results suggest that stellar black holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusters today , and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long - term dynamical evolution and the present - day dynamical structure of many clusters . </S>"
