    "in a 16-hour guaranteed time project ( p.i .",
    "gran olofsson ) using the spire fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) , spectra in the 4601540ghz range were obtained of 13 protoplanetary disks around herbig stars : abaur , hd100546 , hd97048 , hd163296 , ttau , hd142527 , hd144432 , rytau , hd104237 , hd36112 , hd169142 , hd100453 and twhya .",
    "the data were processed in hipe 9 , followed by subtraction of a median background signal obtained from the off - center detectors .",
    "all spectra show a smoothly rising dust continuum , while only the first five of the above list show detectable line signal .",
    "the disk emission lines , presented in fig .  [ fig : spectra ] , are unresolved both spatially ( the spire fts beam is 4217@xmath0 ) and spectrally ( @xmath1 @xmath2 4001300 ) .",
    "spectral lines are fitted using a dedicated fourier transform line fitter tool ( available online at ` www.uleth.ca/phy/naylor/ ` ) .",
    "table  [ t : linedetections ] lists lines detected in at least one target besides t tau .",
    "first , it is evident from the observations that the continuum and co lines toward ttau originate in an extended protostellar envelope rather than in a much smaller disk .",
    "this is likely also the case for the cold h@xmath3o vapor .",
    "second , the n@xmath4 line toward hd163296 is @xmath5@xmath6 times brighter than what is predicted by current ( x - ray ) irradiated disk models ( e.g. , aresu  2011 ) , even when invoking x - ray luminosities much higher than appropriate for hd163296 . since n@xmath4 is also detected in all off - center detectors up to 1@xmath7 away from the star , we hypothesize that a single ( external ) source is responsible for ionizing nitrogen both in the disk / jet of hd163296 and in the surrounding gaseous medium .",
    "finally , we plan to use the unique set of 43 to 1312 lines of co and @xmath8co ( @xmath9 @xmath2 50500k ) to characterize warm gas in the herbig protoplanetary disks .",
