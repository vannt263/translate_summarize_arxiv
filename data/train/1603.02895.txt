    "nowadays the growing interest to underwater explorations necessitates design of appropriate and efficient underwater communication methods and systems . in comparison to the traditional underwater communication method , namely acoustic communication",
    ", the optical counterpart has three interesting advantages : higher bandwidth , lower time latency and higher security .",
    "these unique features make underwater wireless optical communication ( uwoc ) as a powerful alternative for high speed and large data underwater communications .",
    "however , presently uwoc systems have the capability to communicate through ranges that are typically less than @xmath5 m , which hampers their widespread usage .",
    "this impediment is mainly due to the three degrading effects in uwoc channels , i.e. , absorption , scattering and turbulence which cause loss , inter - symbol interference ( isi ) and fading on the propagating light wave , respectively .",
    "although , many worthwhile researches have been carried out to investigate the performance of free - space optical ( fso ) communication systems over turbulent atmosphere channels @xcite , study and design of appropriate uwoc systems yet have received less attention .",
    "the primary works in uwoc area have mainly focused on investigating the absorption and scattering effects of underwater optical channels @xcite . meanwhile , uwoc channel impulse response has been modeled using monte carlo ( mc ) approach in @xcite .",
    "also a cellular uwoc network based on optical code division multiple access ( ocdma ) technique has been proposed in @xcite while potential applications and challenges of such a network is elaborated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , beneficial application of serial relaying on the performance of ocdma - based underwater users is investigated in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "turbulence - induced fading in uwoc channels has been studied in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the average ber of an uwoc system with respect to the log - normal distribution for fading statistics has been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "also in @xcite the authors have proposed spatial diversity technique , i.e. , multiple - input multiple - output transmission over uwoc links , to mitigate degrading effects of turbulence - induced fading ; and therefore to improve the system performance .    the research in this paper is inspired by the need to design an uwoc system to support longer ranges communications with realistic transmit powers .",
    "it has been shown that all the above mentioned impairing effects of uwoc channels are incremental functions of distance @xcite .",
    "this distance dependency motivates us to design some intermediate nodes , namely relay nodes , in order to divide a long communication distance to shorter ones each with much reduced absorption , scattering and fading effects .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider multi - hop transmission over turbulent underwater optical channel .",
    "relay nodes operate based on bit detect - and - forward ( bdf ) strategy , i.e. , each intermediate node only detects the received signal from the previous node and forwards the detected signal to the next node .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the channel and system models are described . in section iii",
    ", we analytically derive the ber expressions of a single - hop uwoc link as the building block for end - to - end ber evaluation .",
    "we also apply photon - counting method to evaluate the system ber in the presence of shot noise . in section iv",
    ", we use the results of section iii to analyze the end - to - end performance of multi - hop uwoc systems . in section v , we provide the numerical results for our derived analytical expressions as well as mc simulations .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section vi .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , uwoc channel imposes absorption , scattering and turbulence on the propagating light wave . in order to include the absorption and scattering effects",
    ", we apply monte carlo method to simulate the uwoc channel impulse response similar to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we denote this fading - free impulse response of the @xmath6th hop by @xmath7 .    on the other hand , to take into account the @xmath6th hop turbulence effects we multiply @xmath7 by a fading coefficient @xmath8 , which for weak oceanic turbulence can be modeled as a random variable ( rv ) with log - normal probability density function ( pdf ) @xcite as ; @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the mean and variance of the gaussian distributed log - amplitude factor @xmath12 . to guarantee that fading neither attenuates nor amplifies the average power , we normalize fading coefficients as @xmath13=1 $ ] , which implies that @xmath14 .    for light wave with instantaneous intensity @xmath15 , scintillation index is defined as @xmath16-\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}^2[{i_{i}}]}\\right)/{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}^2[{i_{i}}]}$ ] , which is thoroughly studied for optical plane and spherical waves propagating in underwater turbulent channel @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for weak optical turbulence , scintillation index relates to the log - amplitude variance as @xmath17 .          as it is illustrated in fig . 1",
    ", we consider an uwoc system with @xmath18 intermediate relay nodes in a serial topology .",
    "each of the relay nodes operates based on bdf strategy , i.e. , each @xmath6th node as @xmath19th node , relay @xmath20 as @xmath6th node , and destination @xmath21 as ( @xmath22)th node . ] after detecting the received optical signal , transmits the detected signal with the average transmitted power per bit of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the transmitted data sequence of the @xmath6th node has the form @xmath24 , in which @xmath25 is the bit duration time and @xmath26 is the @xmath27th time slot transmitted bit of the @xmath6th node , representing on - off keying ( ook ) modulation .",
    "@xmath28 is the @xmath27th time slot transmitted optical signal of the @xmath6th node , which has the average power of @xmath23 . for the sake of fairness , we assume that the total transmitted power per bit of multi - hop transmission is equal to the transmitted power per bit of single - hop transmission , i.e. , @xmath29 .    the received optical signal of the @xmath6th node after propagating through underwater optical channel with aggregated impulse response of @xmath30 can be expressed as ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denotes the convolution operation .",
    "each receiver , either within the relay nodes or in the destination performs symbol - by - symbol processing , which is suboptimal in the presence of isi @xcite . in other words ,",
    "each receiver integrates over each @xmath25 seconds and compares the result with an appropriate threshold to detect the received optical signal .",
    "it is worth noting that various noise components , namely signal - dependent shot noise , background light , dark current and thermal noise , all affect the aforementioned detection process .",
    "in this section , we analytically obtain the average ber of single - hop transmission .",
    "we also apply photon - counting method @xcite to evaluate the @xmath6th node conditional ber in the presence of shot noise .      as discussed above , various noise components , i.e. , signal - dependent shot noise , background light , dark current and thermal noise all affect the system performance .",
    "since these components are additive and independent from each other , in this subsection we model them as an equivalent noise component with gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that the signal - dependent shot noise is negligible with respect to the other noise components and hence the noise variance is independent from the incoming optical signal power @xcite . based on eq .",
    ", the @xmath19th time slot integrated current of the receiver output can be expressed as ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the photodetector responsivity , @xmath38 is the photodetector quantum efficiency , @xmath39 c is electron charge , @xmath40 is planck s constant , @xmath41 is the optical source frequency and @xmath42 denotes the channel memory .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath43 refers to the isi effect and @xmath44 interprets the desired signal contribution , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath46 is the receiver integrated noise component , which has a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath47 @xcite .    assuming the availability of channel state information ( csi )",
    ", the receiver compares its integrated current over each @xmath25 seconds with threshold value of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the conditional probability of error when ",
    "@xmath49 \" is sent , can be obtained as ; @xmath50}{2\\sigma_{t_b}}\\!\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the gaussian - q function .",
    "the final ber can be obtained by averaging the conditional ber over fading coefficient @xmath52 and all @xmath53 possible data sequences for @xmath54s , as follows ; @xmath55f_{{\\tilde{h}}}(\\tilde{h})d{\\tilde{h}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of log - normal underwater fading channel , the averaging over fading coefficient in can be effectively calculated using gauss - hermite quadrature formula ( ghqf ) [ 21 , eq .",
    "( 25.4.46 ) ] as follows ; @xmath56 in which @xmath57 is the order of approximation , @xmath58 , are the weights of the @xmath57th order approximation and @xmath59 is the @xmath60th zero of the @xmath57th - order hermite polynomial , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the parameter @xmath62 in is defined as ; @xmath63      in the previous subsection , we dealt with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) model , which considers the incoming optical signal as a constant coefficient ( conditioned on @xmath52 ) and all the noise components as an equivalent additive gaussian rv .",
    "this model , however is straightforward and common @xcite , does not consider the shot noise effect induced by the fluctuating nature of optical signals . in other words ,",
    "due to the statistical nature of light as a stream of photons , in optical systems the signals have random fluctuations which can be modeled by poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "also signal - dependent shot noise , dark current and background light can be modeled as poisson distributed rvs , while thermal noise induced by the receiver electronic circuit is usual to be considered as a gaussian distributed rv @xcite . in this circumstances , either saddle - point or gaussian approximations , which are based on photon - counting methods",
    ", can be used to evaluate the system ber in the presence of shot noise . in this subsection",
    ", we apply photon - counting methods to evaluate the conditional ber of the @xmath6th node .",
    "when the ( @xmath64)th node transmits data bit @xmath65 on its @xmath19th time slot , the photo - detected count signal generated by the @xmath6th node integrate and dump circuit can be modeled as @xmath66 , in which @xmath67 is a gaussian distributed rv with mean zero and variance @xmath68 , corresponding to the @xmath6th node thermal noise .",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are boltzmann s constant , the receiver equivalent temperature and load resistance , respectively . moreover based on , conditioned on @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 is a poisson distributed rv with mean ; @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the @xmath6th hop channel memory and @xmath77 , in which @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the mean photoelectron count rates of background light and dark current of the @xmath6th node , respectively .",
    "now , based on saddle - point approximation , the conditional ber of the @xmath6th node can be calculated as @xcite ; @xmath80 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the @xmath6th node threshold . @xmath82 and @xmath83 are conditional probabilities of error for  on \" and  off \" states , respectively and are defined as ; @xmath84}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\left(m^{(i)}_1e^{s_1}+\\sigma_{th } ^2 + 1/s^2_1\\right)}},\\label{39}\\\\     & q_+(\\beta^{(i)}\\!,s_0)\\!=\\!\\frac{{\\rm exp}\\left[m^{(i)}_0\\!\\left(e^{s_0}\\!-\\!1\\right)\\!+\\!{s^2_0\\sigma_{th } ^2}/2\\!-\\!s_0\\beta^{(i)}\\!-\\!{\\rm ln}|s_0|\\right]}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\left(m^{(i)}_0e^{s_0}+\\sigma_{th}^2 + 1/s^2_0\\right)}}.\\label{40 }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown that the parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath81 can be obtained by numerical solving of the following set of equations @xcite ; @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 as solving the above equations may be cumbersome and time consuming , gaussian approximation , which is simple and fast but is not as accurate as saddle - point approximation , can be used to evaluate the conditional ber based on photon - counting methods .",
    "in fact , gaussian approximation approximates all the poisson rvs with gaussian distributed rvs , where each of the approximated rvs has the same mean and variance , and then leads to the following equation for the system conditional ber @xcite ; @xmath90 hereafter , for the sake of brevity we denote the @xmath6th node conditional ber with @xmath91 , which can be obtained using one of eqs . , or .",
    "in this subsection , we analyze the end - to - end ber of the relay - assisted uwoc system relying on the @xmath6th node conditional ber , obtained in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath92 denote the number of nodes that incorrectly detect their previous node s @xmath19th time slot transmitted bit .",
    "for this case , the conditional end - to - end correct detection probability @xmath93 can be obtained as ; @xmath94 in which @xmath95 is the fading coefficients vector and @xmath96 implies the transmitted data sequences of all transmitters .",
    "@xmath97 is the conditional probability that @xmath98 nodes out of @xmath22 nodes incorrectly detect the received bit .",
    "obviously , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the end - to - end conditional ber can be evaluated as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 specifies the set of all the even numbers in the set @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the integer portion of the real value @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath97 for @xmath107 can be obtained as ; @xmath108\\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] averaging @xmath109 over @xmath96 and @xmath110 results into @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is defined as ; @xmath113 in which @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the joint pdfs of @xmath116s and @xmath117s , respectively .",
    "since @xmath118s are independent with identical probability and @xmath117s are also independent , eq . reduces to a similar form of eq . except that @xmath91s are replaced by @xmath119s which are the averaged form of @xmath91s and",
    "are defined as ; @xmath120 replacing instead of @xmath91 in eq . results in @xmath112 , and eventually the end - to - end average ber can be evaluated as @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the end - to - end average ber of uwoc systems with serial bdf relaying can be obtained through one - dimensional integrals which in the case of weak oceanic turbulence leads to a closed form solution , using ghqf as demonstrated in .",
    "it is worth noting that in some common scenarios ( e.g. , the following two cases ) @xmath112 and therefore the average ber can be expressed more explicitly .    *",
    "the form of eq .",
    "suggests that @xmath112 decreases rapidly for larger values of @xmath98 , since it is proportional to the product of the bers of @xmath98 nodes .",
    "therefore , to simplify the average end - to - end ber expression , we make an assumption : however , it is possible to detect a bit correctly at the destination despite of incorrect detection in some of the intermediate relay nodes , i.e. , when @xmath121 , we neglect these fortunate events and assume that a bit can be correctly detected at the destination if and only if all the receivers detect without an error ( i.e. , when @xmath122 ) .",
    "this assumption is valid particularly when each hop has a good performance , i.e. , a small @xmath119 . in this case , the average end - to - end ber can be evaluated as ; @xmath123 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * suppose that all links have the same average ber of @xmath124 .",
    "this is a valid assumption for example when all hops have the same link length and water quality and all receivers have the same structure . in this case , the average ber of the system can be obtained as follows ; @xmath125",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results for the relay - assisted uwoc system ber . we also obtain the system ber using numerical simulations to verify the accuracy of our derived analytical expressions .",
