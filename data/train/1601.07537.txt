    "the need for dark matter and dark energy to reconcile einstein s general relativity ( gr ) with observations , together with the lack of other tangible evidence for their existence , motivates the study of alternative gravity theories aiming to achieve similar success without resort to the dark sector .",
    "conformal gravity ( cg ) , like gr , employs a metric to describe gravity as curved space - time .",
    "but the cg field equations , which dictate how matter and energy generate space - time curvature , arise from a local symmetry principle , conformal symmetry , which holds for the strong , weak and electro - magnetic interactions , but is violated by gr .",
    "conformal symmetry means that stretching the metric by a factor @xmath9 , and scaling all other fields by appropriate powers of @xmath10 , has no physical effects .",
    "in particular , local conformal transformations preserve all angles and the causal relations among space - time events , but physical distances , time intervals , and masses change , so that only local ratios of these quantities have physical significance .    unlike gr , and many related alternative gravity theories , terms allowed in the cg action",
    "are highly restricted by the required conformal symmetry .",
    "gr s einstein - hilbert action adopts the ricci scalar @xmath11 , leading to einstein s famous 2nd - order field equations , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the einstein tensor , @xmath14 is newton s constant , and @xmath15 is the cosmological constant .",
    "these terms are excluded in cg because @xmath15 and @xmath14 build in fundamental scales , and @xmath11 violates conformal symmetry .",

    "the most recent fits @xcite to a sample of 111 galaxies require invoking the quadratic potential @xmath61 to counter the rising @xmath63 potential on the outskirts of particularly large galaxies like malin  1 . the required scale , @xmath89  @xmath90  mpc@xmath91 , is plausibly identified with the observed size of typical structures in the cosmic web . for the @xmath92 point mass illustrated in fig .

    "the role of @xmath8 in sourcing @xmath36 has been previously investigated @xcite , but the best cg analysis of galactic rotation curves to date @xcite omits this effect , arguing that it is negligible . in our view conclusions about the success of cg in fitting galaxy rotation curves",

    "we argue below that even though @xmath8 is very nearly constant , its radial gradient is large enough to significantly alter predictions for galaxy rotation curves , and moreover the effect on the rotation curve is to cancel that of the linear potential .",
    "null geodesics ( photon trajectories ) are independent of conformal transformations , and those of the mk metric are well studied @xcite .",
    "a major challenge to cg is that a linear potential with @xmath95 is needed to fit galaxy rotation curves , and this produces light bending in the wrong direction , away from the central mass rather than toward it , making it difficult to account for observed gravitational lensing effects .",

    "<S> we discuss the effect of a conformally coupled higgs field on conformal gravity ( cg ) predictions for the rotation curves of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the mannheim - kazanas ( mk ) metric is a valid vacuum solution of cg s 4-th order poisson equation if and only if the higgs field has a particular radial profile , @xmath0 , decreasing from @xmath1 at @xmath2 with radial scale length @xmath3 . since particle rest masses scale with @xmath4 , their world lines do not follow time - like geodesics of the mk metric @xmath5 , as previously assumed , but rather those of the higgs - frame mk metric @xmath6 , with the conformal factor @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the required stretching of the mk metric exactly cancels the linear potential that has been invoked to fit galaxy rotation curves without dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also formulate , for spherical structures with a higgs halo @xmath8 , the cg equations that must be solved for viable astrophysical tests of cg using galaxy and cluster dynamics and lensing .    </S>",
