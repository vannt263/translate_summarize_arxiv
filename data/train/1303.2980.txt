    "in the local universe , ngc 6240 ( @xmath10=@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a unique galaxy , in the throes of a violent merging event and on its way to becoming an elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is experiencing intense star formation ( e.g. , @xmath12 yr@xmath2 in yun & carilli 2002 ; @xmath13 yr@xmath2 in engel et al .",
    "2010 ) . with @xmath14 just below @xmath15 , the luminosity threshold for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , sanders & mirabel 1996 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) , ngc 6240 is expected to become an ulirg when the galaxies coalesce and a final starburst is triggered @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray images @xcite of the central region of ngc 6240 revealed two gravitationally interacting active supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) separated by 1.5 ( @xmath10.7 kpc ) .",
    "these sources are characterized by the highly absorbed hard x - ray spectra typical of compton thick active galactic nuclei ( agns ; * ? ? ?",

    "they each have an observed luminosity of @xmath16 erg s@xmath2 , and show prominent neutral fe k@xmath4 lines at 6.4 kev present in the spectra of both nuclei @xcite .    limited by the number of counts , marginal evidence of an h - like fe line in the spectral fit and extended hard x - ray emission in the morphology",
    "was also suggested by @xcite .",
    "this line emission could be associated with a spatially resolved , multi - temperature hot gas outflow , powered by the starburst activity that dominates the 0.5 - 3 kev x - ray emission ( @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",

    "_ xmm_-newton observations @xcite resolved the fe k line complex into three narrow lines , the neutral fe k@xmath4 , , and a blend of with fe k@xmath18 . using a three - zone model , @xcite further identified that the emission lines of higher ionization ions ( e.g. , line ) originated from the inner 2.1 kpc region .",
    "xmm_-newton data , however , do not have the resolution to resolve spatially the line - emitting regions .    in this paper , we focus on the spatially resolved 5.5 - 8 kev x - ray emission of the innermost central @xmath15 kpc ( @xmath19 ) region in ngc 6240 based on new , and archival , _ chandra _ imaging .",
    "this choice of hard energy range allows us to investigate the origin of the high temperature gas and the highly ionized iron emission .",
    "a detailed study of the extended soft x - ray halo has been presented in a companion paper @xcite . a third paper ( wang et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) will discuss the extended soft x - ray emission in the @xmath20 region .",
    "taking advantage of the order of magnitude deeper imaging , along with subpixel resolution , we are able to firmly establish the presence and the spatial distribution of the hard x - ray emission . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a luminosity distance of @xmath21 mpc to ngc 6240 ( 1 = 492 pc ) , based on the concordance cosmological parameters ( @xmath22 = 70.5 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath23=0.27 , @xmath24=0.73 ; komatsu et al .",
    "ngc 6240 was observed on may 31 , 2011 with the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for 146 ks ( obsid 12713 , pi : fabbiano ) .",
    "the binary nucleus of ngc 6240 was placed near the nominal aimpoint of the backside - illuminated , low energy sensitive s3 chip .",
    "the acis data were reprocessed with the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations software package ( ciao ; version 4.4 ) using the latest _",
    "chandra _ calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.5.1 .",
    "the net exposure time was 144 ks after screening for brief periods of elevated background .",
    "the archival acis s3 observation ( obsid 1590 , previously presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shown in this work was taken on february 22 , 2002 with a total exposure of 37 ks .",
    "we reprocessed the acis data to generate a new level 2 event file that has the latest calibration and the subpixel resolution algorithm (  edser  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) applied .",
    "we checked for x - ray counterparts of the optical and near infrared point sources in the field of view using the naval observatory mergered astrometric dataset catalog ( nomad ; zacharias et al .",
    "2004 ) , and compared the positions of all the bright point - like x - ray sources across the observations .",
    "we verified the accuracy of the absolute astrometry to within @xmath251 native pixel ( 0.492 arcsec ) , thus no further relative offsets were applied .",
    "the event files were all reprojected to the coordinate frame of obsid 12713 , and the four images were merged using ciao tools reproject_events and dmmerge . because the effective area of the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) zeroth - order image is about 60% of acis - s at 6.4 kev , we also make use of two archival deep hetg observations ( pi : canizares ; obsid 6908 , 159 ks , observed on may 16 , 2006 ; obsid 6909 , 143 ks , observed on may 11 , 2006 ) , providing an equivalent of 180 ks acis - s imaging in the fe k band .",
    "therefore , the combined depth of our imaging data reaches @xmath1363 ks , which improves by an order of magnitude over the first acis image of ngc 6240 ( komossa et al .",
    "2003 ) in the 5.5 - 8 kev range .",
    "the first - order chandra heg spectrum is quite faint , which was previously presented in shu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) but only focused on measurement of the intrinsic width of the neutral iron k@xmath4 emission line .",
    "we obtained the heg spectra from the tgcat database ( http://tgcat.mit.edu/ ) and combined the first orders of the grating data ( the positive and negative arms ) .",
    "the extraction aperture was @xmath26 arcsec centered on the brighter northern nucleus . given the complex diffuse emission , using a larger extraction window will yield unreliable redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) because of blurring of spatial - spectral information along the dispersion direction . for reference ,",
    "the spectral resolution of heg is @xmath27 kev at 6.4 kev ( @xmath28 , fwhm ) and the systematic uncertainty in the heg wavelength calibration is @xmath10.01 kev ( @xmath1430 km s@xmath2 ) at 6.4 kev .",
    "table  [ tab0 ] summarizes the _ chandra _ acis and hetg observations used in our work .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the _ chandra _ acis image of the inner @xmath29 ( @xmath112 kpc across ) region of ngc 6240 in the 5.5 - 8 kev band extracted from the merged data , together with an archival _ hst _ acs / wfc f814w image ( cycle 14 program 10592 , pi : a. evans ) , highlighting the highly disturbed optical morphology of ngc 6240 .",
    "the two nuclei are resolved as the brightest x - ray point sources in the center , with peak emission separated by 1.5 ( 710 pc ) , matching the nuclear compact radio source positions ( e.g. , n1 and n2 in the 8.4 ghz map of colbert et al .",
    "1994 ; n1 and s in the 1.4 and 5 ghz maps of beswick et al .  2001 ; north and south black hole positions in max et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "diffuse emission is clearly present ( figure  [ fig1]b ) , extending to @xmath30 ( @xmath15 kpc ) .",
    "hereafter we refer this region as the central region of ngc 6240 .",
    "the x - ray morphology resembles a `` heart '' with loop - like features in the south , the north - east , and the north - west directions ( figure  [ fig1]b ) . a comparison between the observed surface brightness profile and that of a point source further confirms the presence of significant hard x - ray emission reaching @xmath31 radial distance .",
    "figure  [ fig1b ] shows the excess of hard x - rays over the scattered emission in the wings of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the radial profile flattens past 10 , where background emission dominates .",
    "chandra _ psf shown in figure  [ fig1b ] was created simulating a point source at the same position on the detector as the center of ngc 6240 in the single observation of the longest exposure ( obsid 12713 ) using the _ chandra _ ray tracer ( chart ) and the marx simulator .",
    "this psf was then rescaled to match the combined 5.5 - 8 kev counts from the two nuclei .",
    "since the nuclei are separated by 1.5 , and we are interested in demonstrating the presence of extended emission several arcseconds from the nuclei , this is an adequate procedure .",
    "for the investigation of extended emission close to the nuclei ( e.g. , between the nuclei ) , we have performed a more complex 2-d image fitting with two psf components , described in the next section .",
    "previous work by boller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) identified ionized fe k emission lines from the presence of a collisionally ionized plasma with a temperature @xmath32 kev , producing the ( at 6.7 kev ) and ( at 6.93 kev ) k@xmath4 recombination lines .",
    "boller et al . also inserted in their fit the neutral or low ionization fe k@xmath4 line ( expected at 6.4 kev ) and k@xmath18 line ( at 7.058 kev ) , each modelled with a gaussian line .",
    "such fluorescent lines of large ( up to few kev ) equivalent widths ( ews ) arise from large column density gas which strongly attenuates directly viewed x - rays from the agns .    to shed light on the spectral properties of the spatially resolved central region",
    ", we extracted the spectra of both nuclei and all the emission in the 10-radius circle .",
    "figure  [ fig2a]a compares the acis spectra of the central region of ngc 6240 ( circle in figure  [ fig1 ] , all emission within @xmath33=10 , @xmath15 kpc from the nuclei ) and the innermost region containing the two nuclei ( ellipse in figure  [ fig1 ] , full lengths of the axes @xmath34 ) .    the complex fe k line structure detected in _ xmm_-newton spectra @xcite is clearly present in the _ chandra _ acis spectra ( figure  [ fig2a ] ) and contributes most counts , in contrast to the low continuum in the same region .",
    "approximately 80% of this continuum comes from the innermost region enclosing the nuclei .",
    "there are notable differences between the two spectra , which are further illustrated in figure  [ fig2a ] showing the residual spectrum excluding the nuclei .",
    "following @xcite , we added four narrow gaussian emission lines ( representing neutral fe k@xmath4 , , , and fe k@xmath18 ) to a highly absorbed power law continuum to fit the spatially resolved spectra ( the northern nucleus , the southern nucleus , and the extended emission within @xmath30 , i.e. , nuclei+diffuse ) .",
    "this phenomenological approach is adopted to identify the spatial distribution of the line emission , and a more physically meaningful model will be used in the later section . to prevent oversubtraction of diffuse emission from the hot gas in the nuclear region",
    ", we did not exclude the innermost region when evaluating the hot gas content in the @xmath35 emission ; instead , we included nuclear components to represent the contribution from the agns .",
    "figure  [ fig2a ] also shows a hint for two peaks in the line , which resembles double peaked emission line profiles seen in the optical spectra of agn with bi - conical outflows ( e.g. mrk 78 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is statistically insignificant : the probability that the model with one more gaussian component improves over the current fit is only 80% based on a likelihood ratio test ( 10000 simulations ) performed using xspec .",
    "in fact , the energy resolution of the acis s3 detector is 0.2 kev ( fwhm ) at 6.4 kev whereas the apparent double peaks are separated by 0.05 kev , therefore we suggest that it is not a real resolved feature .",
    "the and k@xmath18 lines are blended together at the spectral resolution of the acis ccd , therefore we fixed the k@xmath18 line center energy at 7.058 kev ( rest frame ) and scaled the line intensity according to the theoretical ratio ( 1/8.8 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relative to the k@xmath4 line .",
    "the best - fit centroid energies , ews , and line fluxes , and associated 1-@xmath36 errors are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "although the first - order _ chandra _ heg spectrum is faint , we attempted to spectroscopically resolve the various fe features .",
    "the grating spectrum was rebinned for a minimum s / n ratio of 3 and was fitted with the similar model consisting of an absorbed power law continuum plus gaussian lines using xspec .",
    "again we caution that the best - fit value of @xmath37 for the simplistic power law continuum model is not physically meaningful but simply parameterization .",
    "we recovered a @xmath38 km s@xmath2 for the fek@xmath4 6.4 kev line , consistent with the @xmath39 km s@xmath2 reported in shu et al .",
    "interestingly , the fexxv line at 6.7 kev is marginally resolved at @xmath40 significance with the measured @xmath41 km s@xmath2 , implying a large velocity range in the hot gas kinematics .",
    "furthermore , the heg spectrum does not resolve this line into two peaks , although it shows the line is broad ( @xmath42 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "more counts would have allowed finer binning to attempt resolving the broad line into two or more kinematic components .",
    "the line fluxes further confirm that the emission is spatially extended while the neutral fe k@xmath4 emission is concentrated at the nuclei .",
    "the neutral or weakly ionized fe k@xmath4 line emission at 6.4 kev ( centered at 6.25 kev in the observer frame ) is also mostly associated with the nuclei , with @xmath115% of the total fe i k@xmath4 emission in the extended region ( figure  [ fig2a ] ) . at the 6.4 kev energy , the psf scattering of nuclear emission to the larger radii",
    "can not be neglected , which is @xmath110% .",
    "taking this into account , the spatially extended fe i k@xmath4 emission is at 5% of the total .",
    "the emission is fully accounted for by the innermost nuclear emission , indicating that the mostly ionized h - like iron is confined in this region .",
    "in contrast , @xmath130% of line emission appears to originate in the extended region outside of the nuclear region ( taking into account of the psf contribution ) . in the following",
    "we will investigate the morphology of this emission .",
    "given that the xmm spectra @xcite come from a larger region , the similarity of the fluxes with our _ chandra _ measurements excludes significant fe emission beyond @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis above shows that the agns alone in ngc 6240 can not account for the observed fe k complex , except for the fe k@xmath4 and k@xmath18 emission ( the latter fainter and blended with ) , which is due to fluorescence of neutral or low ionization material near the agns .",
    "guided by the spectra ( figures  [ fig2a ] and  [ fig2 ] ) , we extracted _ chandra _ narrow - band line images to investigate the morphology of the emission line gas .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows images in the 5.5 - 6 kev continuum band that is free from any significant line emission , the fe k@xmath4 line ( 6 - 6.4 kev ) and the line ( 6.4 - 6.7 kev ) . the blended and fe i k@xmath18 emission was examined but not shown here , since it does not show any evidence for emission beyond the nuclear region . although the line emission dominates in these narrow bands , the contribution of the continuum has been removed from the images regardless , assuming a single power law with a photon index ( @xmath43 ) from the spectral fit of the continuum in the central region . the contribution from the continuum in the emission line bands",
    "is calculated using the photon index and the counts in 5.5 - 6.0 kev , taking into account the difference in the effective areas .",
    "given that the starburst likely dominates the extended emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we further confirmed that the following results do not change adopting a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( kt@xmath16 kev for the hot gas ) to approximate the flat continuum .",
    "the continuum - subtracted line emission images clearly show that the 6.4 kev fe i k@xmath4 line peaks at the dual nuclei , with weak emission extending to @xmath44 from the nuclei and contributing @xmath110% of the total @xmath1900 fe k@xmath4 counts .",
    "the emission is also centrally peaked at the nuclear region with a dominating southern nucleus , but it appears more extended to the southwest and to the east ; the @xmath30 region outside of the nuclei contains @xmath140% of the @xmath1500 total counts .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the results from spectral analysis above .",
    "to extract more morphological information from the data , we performed image restoration using the expectation through markov chain monte carlo ( emc2 ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of this method with _",
    "images was demonstrated with a number of astronomical imaging studies @xcite .",
    "the emc2 deconvolution is more effective for preserving diffuse features compared to other psf - deconvolution algorithms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "only the single deep imaging observation ( obsid 12713 ) and the associated psf were used to minimize the psf variations across multiple observations .",
    "the psf - deconvolved images , shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , provide the highest resolution view of the central region .",
    "in particular , the faint diffuse emission is more obvious in figure  [ fig4]c .",
    "close examination of the images suggests the possibility of some extended hard x - ray emission in the region between the two nuclei , especially in the fe xxv band ( and perhaps in the fe k@xmath4 band ; see figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , evaluating the significance of this emission is very difficult because of the close separation ( 1.5 ) of the nuclei .",
    "the psf wings of the two x - ray point sources overlap in this region and enhance the emission here , which needs to be taken into account . simulating two point sources",
    "convolved with the psf , we performed 2-d image fitting to subtract the psf on the 5.5 - 8 kev image , as well as individual narrow band images , using sherpa .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "for the 5.5 - 8 kev image that has most counts , besides the clear extension to the southwest and the northeast ( already noted above as the extended central region ) , the residual image further indicates that there is extended emission in the region between the two nuclei , immediate north of the southern nucleus , at @xmath110  @xmath36 significance level when evaluated using a @xmath45 box region . for the narrow band images ,",
    "the statistics are poorer ; nevertheless , this extended feature is seen in all three residual images .",
    "its significance ranges from @xmath16  @xmath36 in the line emission to @xmath13  @xmath36 in the fe k@xmath4 line emission .",
    "we further checked for possible contamination from the psf artifact found in acis data . using the ciao tool make_psf_asymmetry_region",
    ", this artifact should lie in position angle @xmath46 in our data .",
    "given that this psf asymmetry feature may contain only 5% of the flux , it would have in any case minimal impact on our results .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the hard x - ray morphology of the center of ngc 6240 with a number of high spatial resolution images available in other wavelength ranges , aiming to find clues for the physical origin of the extended x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the absolute astrometry of our _ chandra _ acis image is excellent , indicated by the agreement between the coordinates of the x - ray and the radio nuclei ( @xmath10.2 accuracy , see max et al .",
    "2007 for a further astrometry discussion ) .",
    "we first compare the 5.5 - 8 kev emission with the optical h@xmath4 emission morphology from _",
    "f673n image @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig6a]a .",
    "the 5.5 - 8 kev image was adaptively smoothed with ciao tool dmimgadapt using a gaussian kernel with smoothing scales of 1 pixel to 20 pixels , to better visualize structures in the diffuse emission . as a separate approach , the same 5.5 - 8 kev image with the psf deconvolution applied",
    "is also shown in figure  [ fig6a]b .",
    "the optical peaks are not aligned with the x - ray nuclei due to obscuration . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have previously shown that on 10 ( 4.9 kpc ) scale , the h@xmath4 emission and the soft x - ray emission share a similar morpholgy consisting of filaments and loops .",
    "the overall morphology of the soft x - ray emission in our deep image ( wang et al .",
    "2013 ) is similar to that shown in komossa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) but with finer structure details , closely following the optical h@xmath4 emission .",
    "such morphological correspondence is seen but less obvious in the hard x - ray emission , except for the bright h@xmath4 filament to the east and the loop to the northwest of the nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig6a]c and  [ fig6a]d further compare the h@xmath4 morphology with images in the 5.5 - 6 kev continuum band and the band .",
    "a close morphological correspondence between the h@xmath4 and the hard x - rays can be found at the base of an incomplete loop to the west of the nuclei ( figure  [ fig6a]c and d ) , and at the filament to the south and east of the southern nucleus ( figure  [ fig6a]d ) .",
    "next we compare the 5.5 - 8 kev image with the [ feii ] 1.644  @xmath47 m line emission @xcite in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the [ feii ] emission in ngc 6240 could be produced by shocks in supernova remnants ( snrs ; see van der werf et al .",
    "1993 for detailed discussion on possible excitation mechanisms ) , and is brightest at the locations of the two nuclei , consistent with the presence of nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "the two [ feii ] emission peaks fall close to the x - ray nuclei , with a slight offset ( 0.2 ) to the north relative to the x - ray northern nucleus .",
    "we find a close correlation of the spatially extended emission with the near ir h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) 2.12  @xmath47 m emission obtained with keck ii @xcite .",
    "previous work @xcite noted that the h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) emission in ngc 6240 does not follow the stellar light but peaks between the two nuclei , which is thought to be excited by shocks @xcite .",
    "to compare h@xmath3 and our x - ray images , the astrometry of the h@xmath3 image was first registered using an ir - bright star ( 2mass j16530119@xmath480224138 , @xmath49=10.4 mag ) in the field .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows a remarkably good correspondence between the observed ( top panel ) , and especially the deconvolved ( lower panel ) fe xxv line emission and the h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) 2.12  @xmath47 m emission .",
    "finally we compare the fe i k@xmath4 emission with the cold molecular gas distribution in the nuclear region , traced by the co(3 - 2 ) emission obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) from u et al .",
    "figures  [ fig8]a and  [ fig8]b show that the co emission resembles a ` bridge ' or filament between the two nuclei , with the bright peak offset to the north of the southern fe i k@xmath4 peak .",
    "the evidence for fluorescent fe i emission from this cold gas is marginal at most , with fe k@xmath4 emission extending to the north of the southern nucleus at 3  @xmath36 significance level .      to extract the physical parameters of the highly ionized gas responsible for the and emission",
    ", we fitted the 5.59  kev spectra of the @xmath35 region .",
    "the contribution from the lower temperature gas ( e.g. , @xmath50 kev and @xmath51 kev components ; boller et al .",
    "2003 ) found in previous studies is negligible in this energy range .",
    "we adopted an absorbed single temperature thermal plasma ( @xmath52 ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ) model for the collisionally ionized gas producing the highly ionized and emission lines , plus zero - width gaussian lines centered at 6.400 kev and 7.058 kev ( rest frame ) as the neutral fe k@xmath4 and k@xmath18 lines , respectively . a photoionized origin for the was not considered as this was previously ruled out by the detailed photoionization calculation given by @xcite .",
    "the continuum contribution from the two nuclei is accounted for by including an absorbed power law component , representing the reflected nuclear emission .",
    "the gaussian line components were also subject to this absorption column . the absorption column ( @xmath53 @xmath54 ) , the photon index ( @xmath55 ) and the normalization ( @xmath56 ) are fixed to be the best fit values combining the two nuclei .",
    "the abundance @xmath57 is fixed at solar values @xcite .    the spectrum with the best - fit model is plotted in figure [ fig9 ] , which is well represented with a @xmath58 .",
    "the temperature of the hot plasma is @xmath59 kev with an absorption column of @xmath60 @xmath54 .",
    "the observed 0.58 kev luminosity is @xmath6110@xmath62  @xmath63 and @xmath6410@xmath65  @xmath66 after correction for absorption .",
    "the normalization is @xmath67 , in units of [ @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the angular size distance to ngc 6240 ( cm ) , @xmath70 is the electron density ( @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 the hydrogen density ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we obtain an emission measure ( e.m.@xmath73 ) of @xmath74 @xmath71 , where @xmath75 is a volume filling factor .",
    "it is unlikely that all the hot plasma emission is affected by a high column , given the clumpy morphology and the spatial extent .",
    "fortunately , because we are working in the hard x - ray range , the absorption corrected luminosity is less vulnerable to the uncertainty in the absorption column .",
    "previous studies ( boller et al . 2003 ) and the broad band fit indicate an absorption column of @xmath76 @xmath54 is reasonable outside of the nuclear region .",
    "this implies that our absorption corrected luminosity could be over - estimated by a factor of 2 ( or 0.3 dex in @xmath77 ) . to investigate the impact of the soft x - ray thermal components that are clearly present ( komossa et al .  2003 ,",
    "netzer et al .",
    "2005 ) , we modeled the broad band spectrum of the extended emission ( the same @xmath35 region ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9a ] shows the 0.38 kev band acis spectrum ( grating zero - order spectra were not combined because of low effective area in the soft x - ray band ; see discussion in nardini et al .",
    "the best fit model components are overplotted including two more thermal components with lower temperature ( @xmath78 kev , @xmath79 kev ) , each subjected to an absorption column ( @xmath80 @xmath54 , @xmath81 @xmath54 ) .",
    "the high temperature component has a similar @xmath82 kev that is consistent with the previous fitted value .",
    "fixing their abundances at solar values gives statistically unacceptable fit ( @xmath83 ) and allowing for variation relative to solar abundance improves the fit to ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "remaining residuals are a few peaks higher than model predicted line emission at line energies corresponding to mgxii ( rest frame 1.47 kev ) , sixiv ( 2.01 kev ) and sxvi ( 2.62 kev ) , indicating likely anomalous abundances for these elements .",
    "indeed netzer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested these elements have @xmath12 times higher abundance .",
    "a word of caution is that the soft x - ray emission over a large spatial scale suffers from blending of thermal plasma of inhomogeneous absorption , temperature , and abundance , therefore spatially resolved studies in small regions is preferred . for our purpose of evaluating the contamination from these components to the hard energy range , we only add in gaussian lines to improve the fit ( @xmath85 ) which are shown in figure  [ fig9a ] .",
    "we evaluated that the declining hard tails of the  soft x - ray spectral components only contaminate the 5.58 kev spectral range at 8% level , which has a minimal impact on the derived @xmath86 ( @xmath87 @xmath54 when the hard tails from the softer x - ray components are accounted for ) .    using the line emission as a tracer for the extent of the hottest thermal component , which is confined within the central @xmath88",
    ", we can obtain the volume of the thermal gas emitting hard x - rays , @xmath89 @xmath90 , assuming a spherical geometry .",
    "this implies @xmath91 @xmath71 .",
    "following the calculations done in richings et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the 70 million k gas contains a total mass of @xmath92 and a thermal energy of @xmath93 ergs .",
    "since we assumed solar abundance , this implies the total iron mass in the highly ionized plasma @xmath94 . note that we also explored fitting with abundance left free and the best fit model gives @xmath95 with a lower @xmath96 kev , which has minor impact on the above estimated values .",
    "in addition , there is a degeneracy between the flat powerlaw component ( which is most effectively contrained by the very hard end of the spectrum ) and the hot thermal component ( most effectively constrained by the line assuming fixed solar abundance ) .",
    "we find that a 0.05 dex increase in the normalization for the powerlaw component corresponds to a 0.09 dex decrease in the thermal component .",
    "when non - solar abundance is allowed , it leads to a 0.19 dex decrease in the normalization for the thermal component .",
    "this has negligible impact to our discussion later on the energetics of the hot gas .",
    "the filling factor of the hot gas is poorly constrained observationally . nevertheless , hydrodynamic simulations by strickland & stevens ( 2000 ) suggest that @xmath75 ranges between 0.1% to 10% for x - ray bright galactic winds . in the starburst region",
    "@xmath75 is considered to be higher than in the large scale wind , close to 100% ( strickland & heckman 2007 ) . to facilitate our discussion , we assume @xmath97 and caution the large uncertainty on this value .",
    "we consider that this is reasonable average value for the large volume spanned by the hot gas ; the true filling factor is most probably close to unity in the innermost x - ray brightest region and @xmath98 in the outer sphere .",
    "however , we also note that the dependence on @xmath75 is relatively weak for the hot gas mass and thermal energy ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we have unambiguously detected diffuse hard ( 5.5 - 8 kev ) x - ray emission in the central region of the merging galaxy ngc 6240 .",
    "the fe k@xmath4 and k@xmath18 fluorescent lines in ngc 6240 have been firmly associated with the photoionized gas of high column density and low ionization close to the agn ( e.g. , komossa et al .",
    "2003 , netzer et al .",
    "most of the observed line flux is explained by the emission from the ngc 6240 nuclei , and the spatial concentration at the nuclear positions is consistent with this interpretation . even with the long exposure , we do not find strong evidence that the dense molecular clouds in the nuclear region are producing fluorescent fe lines .",
    "the excess of fe i k@xmath4 counts in the co bridge between the nuclei ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) is marginal ( 3@xmath36 significance ) when the scattered counts from both agn are excluded .    what is the origin of the highly ionized gas emitting the line that extends over 5 kpc in ngc 6240 ? given the lirg nature of ngc 6240 characterised by a high sfr ( 25 m@xmath100 yr@xmath2 , engel et al .",
    "2010 ) , we first estimate the contribution to hard x - ray emission by the ensemble of x - ray binary ( xrb ) systems in the starburst . using the correlation between the galaxy - wide 210 kev luminosity and the sfr provided by the _",
    "survey of lirgs ( lehmer et al .",
    "2010 , table 4 ) , the expected @xmath101 from the xrb population is @xmath102 erg s@xmath2 in the 210 kev band , adopting a @xmath103  m@xmath100 yr@xmath2 ( engel et al .",
    "this is only 5% of the observed 210 kev luminosity of the extended hard x - ray emission , strongly indicating that the diffuse emission is dominated by hot gas .",
    "such hard x - ray emission is most likely associated with the thermal gas from merged supernova ( sn ) ejecta and stellar winds present during a starburst .",
    "the he - like line emission is also observed in other well known starburst galaxies like",
    "ngc 253 and m82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ulirg arp 220 @xcite , and the integrated spectrum of a number of lirg / ulirg systems @xcite , suggesting the existence of similar high temperature plasma .",
    "it is worth noting that the observed diffuse hard x - ray emission in ngc 6240 here is almost 100 times more luminous than that observed in the classic superwind system m82 ( @xmath104 erg s@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    using optical imaging and spectroscopy to identify outflow in the warm ionized medium , heckman et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have shown ngc 6240 to host a superwind .",
    "superwinds are believed to be driven by the thermal and ram pressure of an initially very hot ( @xmath105 k ) , high - pressure ( @xmath106 k @xmath71 ) and low - density wind . according to the starburst driven superwind model , a hot gas bubble of internally shocked wind material with a temperature of several kev forms in the region of intense starformation ( chevalier & clegg 1985 , suchkov et al .",
    "1994 , strickland & heckman 2007 ) ; this hot gas eventually flows outward as a high - speed ( few 1000 km s@xmath2 ) wind .",
    "here we detected and spatially constrained for the first time thermal x - ray emission from such hot ( @xmath107 mk ) gas in ngc 6240 , likely the thermalized sn ejecta within the vicinity of the starburst region .    to further investigate whether the thermal energy content of the hot gas could be powered by thermalization of sne shocks , we need to estimate the kinetic energy input from the sne during the starburst",
    ". the resulting heating by sne shocks should at least be comparable to @xmath108 , considering that there are lower temperature phases and the gas has also bulk kinetic energy .",
    "the most often quoted sn rate for ngc 6240 is @xmath109 yr@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will be used next , although we note there is a small range of estimates .",
    "engel et al .  ( 2010 ) calculated a lower sn rate of 0.3 yr@xmath2 assuming 20 myr of continuous star formation at 25 m@xmath100 yr@xmath2 , based on the measured k - band luminosity .",
    "using the correlation between [ feii ] 1.257  @xmath47 m and the sn rate recently found by @xcite from a sample of nearby starburst galaxies ( equation 2 and figure 9 therein ) , we find a higher but comparable sn rate ( @xmath13 yr@xmath2 ) . assuming a fraction ( @xmath110 , chevalier & clegg 1985 , thornton et al .",
    "1998 ) of the kinetic energy input ( @xmath111 ergs per sn ) is converted into thermal energy of the hot gas , the total energy deposited during the past @xmath112 myr of most recent starburst @xcite is @xmath113 ergs , which is comparable to @xmath114 ergs . adopting a 10% filling factor for the hot gas results in a larger @xmath108 and a larger deficiency ( @xmath115 for @xmath110 ) , but it does not impair our conclusion , considering that the thermalization efficiency can be higher than the adopted value of 0.1 in an environment where many sne are exploding @xcite , which will yield a larger @xmath116 that is still consistent with @xmath108 .",
    "these estimates demonstrate that the observed diffuse thermal gas traced by the highly ionized iron line emission in ngc 6240 is consistent with being heated by sne shocks in the starburst .",
    "the cooling time of this thermal gas is @xmath117 myr , slightly larger than the starburst duration , which implies that such x - ray bright phase will be short lived once the starburst ceases .",
    "following @xcite , another useful check is the comparison between the ejected iron mass from sne and the observed iron mass .",
    "adopting @xmath118 as the ejected iron mass per type ii sn @xcite and the average sn rate of @xmath109 yr@xmath2 , the expected iron mass for the 20 myr starburst is @xmath119 , which can easily account for the observed @xmath120 considering not all the iron ejecta are currently x - ray emitting .",
    "therefore this comparison also supports the above scenario that starburst is the origin for the 70 mk gas .",
    "however , the morphological comparison showed some interesting correspondences and differences : ( 1 ) in the nuclear region , while and [ feii ] both peaks ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) at the radio nuclei , bright h@xmath3 emission is observed between the nuclei ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) ; ( 2 ) h@xmath3 and the x - ray emission share similar morphology at the ` arms ' extending southeast and southwest of the southern nucleus ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) , which is not seen with the [ feii ] emission . why do the near - ir h@xmath3 and the x - ray emission share similar extended morphology , but not [ feii ] ?",
    "we suggest that these differences can be attributed to two aspects .",
    "first , there are presence of shocks in different velocity ranges .",
    "secondly , the physical scales of snr is much localized compared to starburst - driven winds .",
    "@xcite suggested that the [ feii ] emission in ngc 6240 may originate in shocks associated with snrs during the starburst in the nuclei , based on the high [ feii]/br@xmath121 ratio .",
    "when dust grains are destroyed by fast shocks , the fe abundance in the gas phase is enhanced .",
    "thus it is straightforward to expect that the [ feii ] and the highly ionized fe emission peaks at the nuclei of ngc 6240 , where the intense star formation activities are and young snr are produced @xcite .",
    "note that in the southern nucleus is @xmath13 times brighter than the northern one ( see figure  [ fig7 ] and table  [ tab1 ] ) , in agreement with a ratio of @xmath12 found in [ feii ] and implying a higher sn rate in the southern nucleus .    from the x - ray perspective , the gas is heated to the high temperature producing the observed hard x - ray emission by the thermalization of the kinetic energy from an ensemble of sne and winds from massive stars , inside the starburst region , and by internal shocks in the superwind at larger radii ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 , norman & ikeuchi 1989 , heckman et al .",
    "emission also peaks at the the radio nuclei and the peaks of [ feii ] emission ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we can assume that we observe the shocked wind matter , whose temperature then gives us a measure of the shock velocity . for non - radiative , strong shocks in a fully ionized monoatomic gas ,",
    "the post - shock temperature is @xmath122 , where @xmath47 is the mean mass per particle and @xmath123 is the boltzmann constant ( mckee & hollenbach 1980 ) . for the observed hot gas ( @xmath124 kev , or @xmath125  k ) , we obtain a shock velocity @xmath126 km s@xmath2 .",
    "other than shocks driven by the starburst , such high velocity shocks are unlikely to be induced by the merger process in ngc 6240 : even in direct collision systems like the taffy galaxy ( ugc 12914/5 ) , the progenitors collided at @xmath1600 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the merging galaxies in ngc 6240 have well passed the first encounter , without showing morphology like the ring galaxies exemplifying such a strong direct collision , and the estimated collision velocity from the co line width is only between 150 and 300 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the bright h@xmath3 emission observed between the nuclei of ngc 6240 has been interpreted to originate in global dissipative shocks resulting from the collisions of the ism of the merging disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the shock velocity was constrained to be at most 40 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the fainter large scale ` arms ' of h@xmath3 emission extending se and sw of the southern nucleus needs a different explanation , as it closely follows the x - ray emission .",
    "as fast outflows ( several thousand km s@xmath2 ) driven by the starburst are expected ( e.g. , heckman et al .  1990 ,",
    "fabbiano et al .  1990",
    "; see veilleux et al .",
    "2005 for a review ) , this large scale h@xmath3 emission can be interpreted as originated from molecular material entrained and shocked by the superwind .",
    "the thermal velocity of this 6 kev gas , estimated as the adiabatic sound speed @xmath1271260 km s@xmath2 ( assuming solar abundance ) , is much higher than the escape velocity @xmath128 , which is @xmath1210 km s@xmath2 at @xmath129 kpc using the dynamical mass @xmath130 in @xcite .",
    "therefore the expanding hot bubble can `` blow out '' to larger radial distance such as the 5 kpc extent seen here . following a simple model of a shock propagating in an inhomogeneous ism in @xcite , the high velocity shock ( @xmath131 km s@xmath2 ,",
    "see above ) in the low density wind responsible for the emission will slow down significantly when encountering a layer of cold molecular gas .",
    "the decreased shock speed @xmath132 can be estimated using the density contrast between the x - ray gas ( @xmath133 @xmath71 ) and the molecular cloud ( @xmath134 @xmath71 ) , following @xmath135 ( spitzer 1978 , equation [ 12 - 39 ] ; note this is different from the shock jump condition ) .",
    "the expected @xmath136 km s@xmath2 agrees well with the velocity constraint from shock excitation for the observed h@xmath3 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have also shown that the hard x - ray emission shares similar characteristics with the optical h@xmath4 emission ( figure  [ fig6a ] ) , with a few filaments and loops that are more apparent in the soft x - rays ( komossa et al .",
    "2003 , wang et al .",
    "the overall picture is that previous models , consisting of multi - temperature , multi - zone thermal plasma powered by starburst can explain the observed emission properties given that the outflows ( and consequently shocks ) have a large velocity range : the hard x - rays are associated with fast shocks driven by sne explosions and the soft x - rays / h@xmath4 related to slower shocks associated with mass loaded starburst winds .",
    "more evidence supporting this scenario also comes from the presence of high velocity h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission in the ` arms ' region , based on prominent wings in the h@xmath3 1 - 0 s(1 ) line ( with full width at zero intensity of @xmath11600 km s@xmath2 ; van der werf et al . 1993 ; engel et al . 2010 ) and h@xmath4 line profile @xcite , tracing the ambient gas entrained and shocked by the superwind . in a very recent co(1 - 0 ) interferometry observation of ngc 6240 , @xcite further identified evidence for a shock wave that propagates eastward from the nuclei .",
    "one of the resolved structures of blue shifted co emission is spatially coincident with the se h@xmath3 filament ( max et al . 2005 ) , which is also associated with h@xmath4 and soft x - ray emission .",
    "the derived kinetic power of the outflowing co gas is @xmath137 erg s@xmath2 , with an estimated age @xmath138 years .",
    "this implies a total kinetic energy of @xmath139 ergs .",
    "recall that the available kinetic input from the multiple sne explosions during the starburst is @xmath140 ergs ( @xmath111 ergs per sn @xmath141 2 yr@xmath2 @xmath142 yr ) , there seems no deficit in the energy budget .",
    "however , we can not yet draw conclusion that no additional energy injection is required , until a full tally of the bulk kinetic energy and thermal energy of the outflowing gas in other phases is available for ngc 6240 . under the assumption that the 70 million k gas is volume filling ( @xmath143 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) , its @xmath144 would exceed the available kinetic energy provided by the recent starburst by @xmath145 ergs , implying additional kinetic power input such as from an agn outflow or multiple star forming episodes .",
    "in fact , the thermal energy content in the large scale ( @xmath1100 kpc ) soft x - ray halo ( @xmath146 kev ) in ngc 6240 identified by@xcite is estimated to be @xmath147 ergs , which hints at additional energy input from a widespread , enhanced star formation proceeding at steady rate over @xmath1200 myr @xcite besides the most recent nuclear starburst .",
    "lastly , we note that a good spatial correlation is also expected if the h@xmath3 emission is excited by localized x - ray irradiation of molecular clouds @xcite . however , this was concluded unlikely @xcite , since the required sn rate of 7 yr@xmath2 @xcite is much higher than the inferred rate from radio , infrared , and our x - ray measurement .",
    "thus we conclude that propagation of fast shocks originated in the starburst driven wind into the ambient dense gas can account for the large scale x - ray and h@xmath3 morphological correspondence .",
    "combining new and archival _ chandra _ observations of ngc 6240 , we have obtained the deepest x - ray image of the central @xmath148 kpc ( @xmath149 ) of the merging ulirg ngc 6240 with sub - arcsecond resolution .",
    "studying the hard x - ray emission centered at fe k complex and comparing to images in other wavebands , here for the first time we clearly resolved hard extended emission with its extension established , and assessed the nuclei contribution to the hard emission separately .",
    "such a hard extended emission was predicted to be the innermost manifestation of superwinds .",
    "so far , the superwind nature of ngc 6240 had been studied mostly in the h@xmath150 , molecular gas , and soft x - rays .",
    "we summarize our findings as follows :    1 .",
    "the x - ray emission from the pair of active nuclei and the diffuse hot gas is resolved in detail . extended x - ray emission from @xmath0 kev",
    "( @xmath170 million k ) hot gas was found over a spatial scale of 5 kpc , indicating the presence of fast shocks with velocity of @xmath12200 km s@xmath2 .",
    "2 .   the observed luminosity of the 70 million k temperature gas is @xmath151 erg s@xmath2 , with a total mass of @xmath152 and thermal energy @xmath114 ergs , assuming a filling factor of 1% for the hot gas .",
    "the total iron mass in the highly ionized plasma is @xmath153 .",
    "both the energetics and the iron mass in the hot gas are commensurate with the expected injection from the starburst , assuming an average sn rate of 2 yr@xmath2 that is in agreement with its high star formation rate and estimates from non - thermal radio emission and [ feii ] luminosity .",
    "3 .   the spatial distribution of the highly ionized gas emitting peaks together with the [ feii ] emission around the radio nuclei , associated with the high concentration of young snrs during the nuclear starburst . the extended emission shows a remarkable correspondence to the large scale morphology of h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) s(1 ) line emission and h@xmath4 filaments .",
    "propagation of fast shocks originated in the starburst driven wind into the ambient dense gas can account for this morphological correspondence .",
    "the fe i k@xmath4 emission peaks at the active nuclei .",
    "no evidence for fluorescent fe i emission is found in the co filament connecting the two nuclei .",
    "although the above superwind scenario accounts for the extended hard x - ray emission and observational evidence in other wavebands , we can not yet rule out additional energy injection in the central region of ngc 6240 ( e.g. , heating by an agn outflow ) . given the poorly constrained volume filling factor of the x - ray emitting gas",
    ", the thermal energy of the hot gas may exceed the available kinetic energy provided by the sne explosions during the most recent starburst ( @xmath154 ergs for @xmath143 ) , implying additional energy input such as from an agn outflow or more complex star formation activities besides the recent nuclear starburst ( see discussion in nardini et al .",
    "a full tally of the bulk kinetic energy and thermal energy of the outflowing gas in other phases is crucial for the evaluation of energy budget in the ngc 6240 system .",
