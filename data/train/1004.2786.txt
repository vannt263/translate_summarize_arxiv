    "a nearly - flat - band system is an electronic system whose one or more bands in the single - particle spectrum can be made arbitrarily narrow by continuously adjusting some parameters of the system , without destroying its structure . to make this phrase more explicit ,",
    "let us consider a tight - binding description of an electronic system . in this description",
    "a single - particle system is given by a graph that consists of a set of sites , with assigned values of external potentials , and a set of bonds connecting the sites , associated to non - vanishing hopping intensities .",
    "such a graph is _ connected _ if any two sites are connected by a sequence of bonds .",
    "graphs of nearly - flat - band systems constitute a class of connected graphs , for which it is necessary to tune the hopping intensities and on - site external potentials , or only one of those sets of parameters , to get one or more degenerate energy levels , the so called _ non - dispersive bands or flat bands _ , whose degeneracy is proportional to the number of lattice sites . as a result of the tuning ,",
    "the hopping intensities and on - site external potentials satisfy some relations , which constitute _ sufficient conditions _ for flat bands .",
    "note , however , that there are connected graphs ( bipartite graphs ) whose spectrum does contain a flat band , and no tuning of hopping intensities is required @xcite .",
    "to each site of a graph there corresponds its _ neighborhood _ , that is the set of all the sites connected with it by bonds .",
    "the _ topology _ of a graph is specified by the set of all the neighborhoods .",
    "it is the topology , and not the geometry , of the underlying connected graph , that decides whether flat bands can appear in a system . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no characterization of the topology of graphs that admit flat bands .",
    "only examples , sometimes of classes , of graphs where nearly flat bands do appear are known @xcite .    by perturbing continuously the sufficient conditions for the flat band , that have to be satisfied by hopping intensities and on - site external potentials , we transform a flat - band system into a nearly - flat - band system . this definition of a nearly - flat - band system , via a flat - band system is a theoretical , mathematical one .",
    "the theoretical limit of non - dispersive band constitutes a nonphysical system that can not be realized in experiment .",
    "the residual entropy of multi - electron free flat - band system , whose flat band is partially filled , is finite , which violates the iiird law of thermodynamics , and there is no fermi surface . the iiird law is violated also in interacting systems ; see @xcite for examples , where the ground - state degeneracy in an interacting case was calculated exactly .",
    "moreover , the density of states of those systems is singular . in experiments , we can only attempt at constructing a nearly - flat - band system , where by suitably adjusting the parameters of the underlying system we can make one or more bands arbitrarily narrow , at least in principle",
    ".    nevertheless , flat - band systems are worth of theoretical studies , since they are more simple for analysis than nearly - flat - band systems , and moreover it might happen that some of their features are stable against perturbations that transform a flat band into a nearly - flat band .",
    "a prominent example of such a feature is ferromagnetism , and quite naturally the first model studied was the paradigmatic hubbard model : @xmath0 where the sums are over all the sites @xmath1 of the underlying graph , and over projections , @xmath2 , of the electron spin on some axis ; @xmath3  the matrix elements of a single - particle hamiltonian between states localized at sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 give the hopping intensities and on - site external potentials ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 , stand for the electron creation and annihilation operators , respectively ; the term proportional to @xmath8 represents a strongly screened coulomb repulsion . when the underlying graph is bipartite , lieb @xcite proved the existence of _ unsaturated ferromagnetism _ in the ground state ( that is , for given number of electrons the total spin of the ground state is a fraction of the maximal one ) , when it is a line graph  a proof of _ saturated ferromagnetism _ in the ground state ( the total spin of the ground state is maximal )",
    "was given by mielke @xcite , and when it belongs to tasaki class  the corresponding result was obtained by tasaki @xcite . in all those cases there is a flat band in the single - electron spectrum , and on switching on the hubbard repulsion the paramagnetic ground state of a free multi - electron system turns into a ferromagnetic one , for a special value of electron density ( or a narrow interval of densities ) and any nonzero value of the hubbard on - site repulsion @xmath9 .",
    "the latter statement means that paramagnetic ground state turns into a ferromagnetic one without any competition between the kinetic and potential energies ( the hubbard repulsion is needed only to lift the macroscopic degeneracy ) , which is another non - physical feature of flat - band systems .",
    "the flat - band ferromagnetism discovered by mielke and tasaki appeared to be robust against perturbations of the flat band .",
    "the proofs of this fact for nearly - flat band systems can be found in @xcite .    while there is a number of theoretical examples of nearly - flat - band systems",
    "( see the papers quoted above ) , we do not know of any measurements performed on real nearly - flat - band systems .",
    "there have been a few proposals of experimental realizations of nearly - flat - band systems such as : atomic quantum wires @xcite , quantum - dot super - lattices @xcite or organic polymers @xcite",
    ". however , the most promising seems to be a realization as cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "due to a very good control of system parameters in the latter case , such a realization would open new possibilities of investigating the mechanism of nearly - flat - band ferromagnetism , inaccessible in other experimental realizations , and beyond the scope of present - day theoretical methods . in this perspective , it is already interesting and challenging to determine theoretically characteristic low - temperature thermodynamic properties of the aforementioned systems .",
    "in this paper , we provide a resume of our investigations of the question : how to recognize a nearly - flat - band ferromagnet by means of thermodynamic measurements ?",
    "in view of the high sensitivity of the considered systems to details of the underlying graph , it would be naive to expect that some general answer , good for any type of such systems , can be given .",
    "we have chosen to concentrate on nearly - flat - band systems described by the hubbard hamiltonian , with the lowest band nearly - flat and separated from the upper bands by a gap , which we call the _ principal gap _ , to distinguish it from any other gap in the spectrum of the system .",
    "moreover , we set the hubbard @xmath9 to be small compared to the value of the principal gap , and the electron density not to exceed @xmath10 , which is the density of those electrons that can be accommodated in the nearly - flat band .",
    "for instance , the tasaki models @xcite and some related models @xcite belong to this class .",
    "one can argue , however , that our thermodynamic results , to be presented below , hold as well for a wider class of systems .",
    "this class includes systems where there are two groups of bands : low - energy bands and high - energy bands with the nearly - flat band being the highest band in the group of the low - energy bands , and separated by a principal gap from the upper bands @xcite .",
    "another group of systems that belongs to this class are the systems where the flat band sticks to a dispersive one in a few points of the brillouin zone , as in the mielke class of models ( see a remark in @xcite and numerical results in @xcite ) .",
    "to minimize the burden of large volume computer work we have performed calculations for the hubbard model whose graph is a one - dimensional lattice , decorated with additional sites located in the middle between the sites of the lattice ( known also as a @xmath11-chain @xcite or a sawtooth chain @xcite ) . for appropriate hopping intensities and external potentials",
    "the lower band of the model is flat and the ground state is ferromagnetic for any @xmath8 , provided the electron density is @xmath12 .",
    "this model belongs to tasaki class of models @xcite .",
    "there are many ways of perturbing the system to get a nearly - flat - band system , whose ground state is ferromagnetic only for sufficiently large @xmath9 . in our calculations we chose the tasaki perturbation @xcite , whose advantage is that the ferromagnetic ground state and its energy are known explicitly .",
    "the real matrix elements @xmath3 of the perturbed model can be chosen as follows ( with the lattice constant of the one - dimensional lattice set to unity ) : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , for an integer @xmath4 , where @xmath18 is the parameter of tasaki perturbation ; up to a factor it amounts to the width of the nearly - flat band .",
    "one finds that the width of the lower band is @xmath19 , that of the upper band ",
    "@xmath20 , and the gap between the bands is @xmath21 .    for comparison ,",
    "we consider also a fictitious noninteracting electron system , not born by a hamiltonian , whose single - particle spectrum consists of two bands , with some dispersion relations , separated by a gap .",
    "the advantage of this model is that the width of the lower band , @xmath22 , the upper band @xmath23 , and the gap between the bands , @xmath24 , can be varied independently , what facilitates observing their impact on thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "we start our considerations of thermodynamic quantities with the entropy per particle , @xmath25 , as a function of temperature , @xmath26 ( throughout the paper @xmath26 is measured in energy units ) , and volume per particle , @xmath27  the inverse of electron density , @xmath28 .",
    "practically , since this entropy is not directly observable , we consider a simply related and accessible to direct measurements quantity  the isochoric heat capacity per particle ( briefly specific heat ) , @xmath29 , for specified values of electron density @xmath28 . the heat capacity at constant volume ,",
    "is ideally suited for our purposes , since it describes a response of a system to heating , exclusively due to thermal excitations .",
    "in contrast to other heat capacities , the isochoric heat capacity contains no contribution of a mechanical or chemical work done by the system .",
    "such an extra contributions blur the response of the system to heating , making it more difficult to identify the system as a nearly - flat - band system .    taking into account the variety of graphs and spaces of parameters of nearly - flat - band systems",
    ", we can claim that ground states of a nearly - flat - band electronic systems are typically paramagnetic , that is the total spin @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of electrons .",
    "this is true even if we restrict the variety of graphs to those that admit ferromagnetic ground states , that is states whose @xmath32 , for suitable values of system parameters .",
    "the reason is that if the underlying graph admits ferromagnetism , rather limited values of electron densities , nearly - flat band widths and hubbard repulsion @xmath9 are required to make the ground state ferromagnetic . quite generally , there is no ferromagnetism , in the above sense , if the electron density and/or hubbard repulsion @xmath9 are too small , and/or the nearly - flat band  too wide .",
    "a principal gap in a single - particle spectrum induces a gap in the spectrum of the corresponding many - electron noninteracting system and interacting system described by the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the spectra of these many - electron systems can be split into a lower part and an upper part . as a result ,",
    "plots of @xmath29 consist of two , low - temperature and high - temperature , humps . as long as our system is paramagnetic , the low - temperature hump is due to low - energy excitations , that is excitations whose energies do not exceed the width of the lower part of energy levels ( the width of the nearly - flat band in the noninteracting case ) .",
    "the high - temperature hump is , in turn , due to high - energy excitations , whose energy does exceed the gap between the low - energy group and the high - energy group of energy levels ( the principal - gap width in a free nearly - flat - band system ) .",
    "consequently , the position of the low - temperature hump is of the order of the width of the nearly - flat band , while that of the high - temperature one is shifted by an energy of the order of the principal gap , at least for not too large @xmath9 .",
    "the degree of overlap of the two humps , i.e the extent and the depth of the well between them , depends mainly on the ratio of the principal gap and the width of the lower band .",
    "the larger this ratio is the better the separation of the humps . for sufficiently large gaps , the bottom of this well reaches zero and is flat",
    "of course , @xmath29 tends to zero if @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "these features are well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cv2b ] , where results for the two - band noninteracting system are shown .",
    ", of the noninteracting two - band model , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( in arbitrary energy units ) , and partially filled lower band , for a decreasing sequence of lower - band widths @xmath22 and for the flat band .",
    "temperature is in a logarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in particular it is clear that this morphology of the @xmath29 plot is no characteristic of a nearly - flat - band system",
    ". it can be observed in any system of the class described above , interacting or noninteracting , where instead of a nearly - flat band there is just a narrow band .",
    "in contrast to a narrow - band system , in a nearly - flat - band one we can exploit the possibility of shrinking the lower band , while preserving the structure of our system . on decreasing @xmath22 , starting from sufficiently small value , the low - temperature hump moves , of course , towards zero and almost linearly in @xmath22 , its half - width shrinks , while its maximum remains essentially unchanged .",
    "these effects can be seen in fig .",

    "temperature is in a logarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the theoretical limit of flat band , we are left with one , high - temperature hump , which may be separated from zero temperature by a visible plateau of zero value , provided the principal gap is large enough .",
    "this is because there is practically no low - temperature excitations from the flat band .    now , suppose that the underlying graph , the electron density , and the hubbard repulsion @xmath9 are such that for those widths of the nearly - flat band that are smaller than some threshold value , @xmath38 ( which depends on @xmath9 ) , the paramagnetic ground state changes into a ferromagnetic one .",
    "starting measurements with the values of @xmath22 somewhat larger than @xmath38 , and then repeating them for a decreasing sequence of values above @xmath38 , one observes the above described `` evolution '' of the low - temperature hump ( see fig .",
    "[ hub1 ] ) .",
    "however , below @xmath38 the gapless low - temperature excitations of a paramagnet ( of hole - particle type ) turn into ferromagnetic excitations  the magnons .",

    "in the previous section we discussed the heat capacity per particle at constant volume , which is proportional to the second derivative with respect to temperature , @xmath26 , of the fundamental thermodynamic function , the helmholtz free energy per particle as a function of @xmath26 and volume per particle , @xmath27 .",
    "an analog of this thermodynamic quantity , biased by finite - size effects , can be calculated numerically for small hubbard systems , with fixed volume and particle number , by means of the canonical ensemble .",
    "formally , the heat capacity at constant chemical potential , per unit volume , @xmath40 , is another quantity of this kind .",
    "it is proportional to the second derivative with respect to temperature of the fundamental thermodynamic function , the grand - canonical potential per unit volume ( i.e. minus the pressure ) as a function of temperature and chemical potential , @xmath41 .",
    "this is , however , an unusual heat capacity , since it refers to open systems that are in thermal equilibrium with particle reservoir of given chemical potential .",
    "consequently , in a plot of @xmath40 versus @xmath26 , different points correspond , in general ( depending on @xmath41 , the electron density at constant @xmath41 , @xmath42 , can be monotonic or not ) , to systems with different amount of matter .",
    "an analog of this thermodynamic quantity , biased by finite - size effects , can be calculated numerically for small hubbard systems , with fixed volume and chemical potential , by means of the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "of course , @xmath43 can be related to @xmath44 , which is the isochoric heat capacity per unit volume , by the thermodynamic identity : @xmath45 the difference between those two heat capacities , @xmath46 , is born by the chemical work that an open system does exchanging matter with matter reservoir when heated .    in a free system ,",
    "whose spectrum consists of a flat band only , @xmath29 vanishes identically , since there are no excitations in this system .",
    "in contradistinction to @xmath29 , @xmath43 can be nonzero , due to the chemical work , the heated system does exchanging matter with a matter reservoir .",
    "in such a system the electron density is a function of the activity @xmath47 only ; we used here the fact that we can always set the energy of the flat band to zero .",
    "hence , the second term of identity ( [ cmu ] )  the chemical work term can be written as @xmath48 in a free system , with only a flat band , @xmath49 , therefore the chemical work term , is nonzero unless the chemical potential coincides with the energy of the flat band . consequently , there is just one hump in a plot of @xmath43 for @xmath50 , located at low temperatures , if @xmath51 is small . the size and",
    "the position of this hump is sensitive to the value of the chemical potential .",
    "if a flat band is accompanied by some upper bands , separated by a gap from the flat one ( like in the systems considered in the previous section ) , the above statements concerning low - temperature hump remain qualitatively true at sufficiently low temperatures and for sufficiently small @xmath51 .",
    "additionally , such a system contributes significantly to @xmath43 at high - temperatures ; there is a high - temperature hump in the plot of @xmath43 , which coincides essentially with @xmath44  the isochoric heat capacity per unit volume .",
    "small @xmath51 guarantees that the low- and high - temperature humps are well separated .    a weak perturbation that turns a flat - band system into a nearly - flat - band one ,",
    "could have influenced significantly only the low - temperature hump .",
    "unlike the low - temperature hump in @xmath29 plot of a free nearly - flat - band system , which is due to thermal excitations from a nearly - flat - band , and therefore is sensitive to the width of this band ( its position moves towards zero temperature as the perturbation decreases ) , the low - temperature hump in @xmath43 is due to exchange of matter , and its position and shape are quite insensitive to the width of the nearly - flat band .",
    "thus , a weak perturbation of the flat band does not change essentially the two - hump @xmath43 plot of the flat - band case .",
    "the above observations are well illustrated in figs .",

    "temperature is in a logarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    now , consider the hubbard model ( [ hubbard ] ) whose graph is specified in section 2 . in the absence of perturbation ( @xmath52 ) , the lower band in the single - particle spectrum is flat and is separated by a gap from the upper band .",
    "there is a basis of the flat - band eigensubspace that consists of localized eigenstates . in terms of slater determinants of those localized single - particle eigenstates",
    ", one can construct a basis of the ground - state eigensubspace of the hubbard model , for any hubbard repulsion @xmath8 , provided the number of electrons does not exceed half - filling of the flat - band @xcite .",
    "derzhko et al @xcite have demonstrated that those bases , as well as ground - state - eigensubspace bases of some similar flat - band hubbard models @xcite , can be mapped onto a fictitious hard - core lattice gas . the ground - state is paramagnetic , and the many - electron excited states are separated by a gap from the ground state , for any filling that is smaller than half - filling of the flat - band .",
    "consequently , for such fillings , at sufficiently low temperatures that make excitations above the ground state very unprobable , the response of the system to heating amounts essentially to that of the hard - core gas corresponding to the macroscopically - degenerate ground state .",
    "since there are no excitations in a closed hard - core gas , @xmath53 vanishes identically .",
    "in contrast , the chemical work term ( [ work ] ) , which in the case under consideration and in many other cases can be calculated analytically , is nonzero for @xmath50 . therefore , there is just one hump in a plot of @xmath43 for @xmath50 , at low temperatures .",
    "a weak perturbation of the flat - band ( @xmath54 ) does not bring essential changes to this low - temperature hump .",
    "it is given essentially by the chemical work term of the hard - core gas corresponding to the ground state of the flat - band limit of the considered nearly - flat - band hubbard model .",
    "therefore , all the above described features of the low - temperature hump of @xmath43 plot in free nearly - flat - band systems , in particular its insensitivity to the width of the nearly - flat band , remain valid in the considered hubbard model .",
    "these observations apply also to other hubbard systems mentioned in section 2 .",
    "it is the derivative @xmath55 that differentiates between hard - core gases and/or flat band systems and makes the shape of the low - temperature hump specific for a system .",
    "those differences are not dramatic ; they are hidden in fine details of the shape of the low - temperature hump ( see the plots in @xcite ) .",
    "naturally , at high temperatures , there develops a high - temperature hump due to excitations above the ground state , much like in the case of a free systems considered above , and it amounts essentially to the specific heat per unit volume , @xmath56 .",
    "the overall picture of @xmath43 plot in the considered hubbard models is qualitatively the same as those in free nearly - flat - band systems considered in the previous paragraph .",
    "the described above features of @xmath43 plot are well illustrated by the plots displayed in @xcite , for the hubbard model considered in this paper , and in @xcite for other hubbard models with flat or nearly - flat - bands .",
    "the data for all those plots were obtained from exact diagonalization of small hubbard systems , with the number of sites in their graphs between 10 and 20 .",
    "apparently , looking at a @xmath43 plot on can hardly infer whether the underlying system is a nearly - flat - band ( flat - band ) hubbard system .",
    "summing up , we propose an answer to the question asked in the title of our report . we argue that the isochoric heat capacity per particle , @xmath29 , is a good candidate , a sufficiently sensitive thermmodynamic quantity , to measure . at the heart of our answer",
    "is the fact that in the case of nearly - flat - band systems we can vary the width of the nearly - flat lower band , and make it as narrow as we wish .",
    "then , we can watch how @xmath29 plot `` evolves '' with the decreasing width of the lower - band , at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "this low - temperature `` evolution '' provides a signature of a nearly - flat band paramagnet , paramagnet - ferromagnet transition , and nearly - flat - band ferromagnet .",
    "a thermodynamic measurement performed only for a single value of a nearly - flat - band width is not sufficient for this purpose .",
    "we demonstrate also that the heat capacity at constant chemical potential , per unit volume , versus @xmath26 , @xmath43 , is not a suitable quantity to measure , since it depends weakly on the width of a nearly - flat - band and is sensitive to the value of the chemical potential kept constant .",
    "the shape of @xmath43 plot is no characteristic of a nearly - flat - band ( flat - band ) hubbard system .",
    "one can ask naturally , whether such thermodynamic characteristics of closed systems like the coefficient of thermal expansion or the isothermal compressibility can be used to recognize nearly - flat - band paramagnets and ferromagnets .",
    "our studies of the nearly - flat - band two - band model suggest that those quantities can be used to detect nearly - flat - band hubbard paramagnets . however , those quantities are not well defined and can not be calculated for small lattice systems .",
    "therefore , we have no data for hubbard systems with ferromagnetic ground state to check if those quantities are suitable also for detecting nearly - flat - band ferromagnets .",
