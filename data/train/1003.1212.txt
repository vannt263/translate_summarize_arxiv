    "various colloidal systems are ideal models for the investigation of crystal nucleation and crystal growth processes . whereas in atomistic systems , nucleation rates or interfacial free energies are hardly experimentally accessible from direct measurements , in colloidal systems the much larger length and time scales allow to determine these properties , at least in principle .",
    "for instance , _ in situ _ measurements of static structure factors in hard sphere - like colloidal systems using light scattering techniques resulted in estimates of nucleation rates and have given insight into the applicability of classical nucleation theory @xcite . moreover , confocal microscopy gives a direct access to particle trajectories and thus , similar as in a computer simulation , any quantity of interest can be computed from the positions of the particles .",
    "recently , several experimental studies using confocal microscopy @xcite have revealed various properties of solid - liquid interfaces .",
    "however , a direct estimate of anisotropic interfacial free energies in colloidal systems has not been possible so far .",
    "two paradigms of colloidal model systems that can be realized experimentally are hard spheres and hard spheres with a short - ranged attractive interaction ( colloid - polymer mixtures ) . due to the short - range of the interactions ,",
    "these model systems are also well - suited for theoretical studies ( e.g.  in the framework of density functional theory @xcite ) and for computer simulations . as far as the solid - fluid transition in hard spheres",
    "is concerned , various molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) techniques have been used to estimate thermodynamic properties such as the coexistence pressure @xcite , kinetic growth coefficients @xcite , and interfacial free energies @xcite . for the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model of colloid - polymer mixtures ( see below ) , mc studies @xcite have provided estimates for the solid - liquid phase boundaries in a wide range of model parameters . however , to our knowledge , interfacial free energies for solid - fluid interfaces have not been determined so far for the ao model .    despite the efforts that have been recently undertaken",
    ", the examination of solid - liquid interfaces even for hard - sphere and hard - sphere - like systems is still subject to various problems .",
    "in particular , the role of finite - size effects has not been investigated in a systematic manner .",
    "recently @xcite , we have made a first preliminary step to fill this gap considering the solid - liquid interfaces of hard spheres and of the metallic system ni . in the latter work , we have estimated the coexistence pressure and the interfacial stiffness @xmath12 ( see below ) using constant - pressure mc simulations of solid - liquid inhomogeneous systems . to estimate @xmath12 , a result of capillary wave theory ( cwt )",
    "was employed , according to which for a rough interface the mean - squared width of the interface grows logarithmically with the lateral size of the system .",
    "thus , we have made use of finite - size effects to compute the interfacial stiffness @xmath12 .    in the present work ,",
    "much more extensive calculations are performed to determine the coexistence pressure and various interfacial properties .",
    "in addition to the hard - sphere system , the ao model for colloid - polymer mixtures is considered . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is much more difficult to compute interfacial properties for the latter colloid - polymer model than for the hard sphere system due to a slower growth kinetics as well as smaller - amplitude capillary fluctuations along the interface .",
    "however , we show that both for the hard sphere system and the ao model accurate values for the coexistence pressure are obtained without the requirement of extrapolation from relatively small system sizes to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the interaction models are introduced and the main details of the simulation are given .",
    "the results on the solid - fluid coexistence pressure are worked out in sec .",
    "[ sec : coex ] , followed by the introduction of local order parameters and the discussion of the interfacial structure in sec .",
    "[ sec : order ]",
    ". then , sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the one - component hard sphere model can be considered as the simplest model with a solid - liquid transition . for a system of hard spheres of diameter @xmath3 ,",
    "the interaction potential is defined by @xmath13 with @xmath14 the distance between two particles .",
    "the freezing of hard spheres has been first observed in early molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . in these simulations , systems of @xmath15 particles",
    "were considered . in this work ,",
    "systems of up to @xmath16 particles are investigated ; in particular to obtain a reliable estimate of the interfacial stiffness @xmath17 .    to a very good approximation",
    ", the equation of state for the fluid phase of the hard sphere model is given by the analytical carnahan - starling equation @xcite and to a lesser degree for the solid by the hall equation @xcite .",
    "accurate values for the thermodynamic properties of the bulk solid are provided by empirical fits to computer simulations @xcite . since any allowed hard - sphere configuration has zero potential energy , the solid - fluid transition in the hard - sphere system",
    "is completely driven by entropy and temperature @xmath8 plays the role of a scaling factor . as a result , the thermodynamic properties are fully controlled by the packing density @xmath18 ( or , by the pressure @xmath19 in case of fluctuating total volume @xmath20 ) . at first glance , it seems to be surprising that hard spheres solidify since one may expect the entropy of an ordered solid phase to be always lower than that of the disordered fluid phase .",
    "however , at sufficiently high packing fractions , the spheres in a solid fcc configuration have locally more freedom to move than in a fluid at the same packing fraction , and the resulting higher number of possible microstates for the solid phase corresponds to a higher entropy .",
    "experimentally , the repulsive interactions between hard sphere colloids can be modified by the addition of non - adsorbing polymers .",
    "although the pairwise colloid - polymer as well as the polymer - polymer interactions are repulsive , an effective attraction between the colloids in colloid - polymer mixtures is induced entropically by a depletion effect @xcite .",
    "plane , assuming a polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath21 . throughout this work , we consider either @xmath22 ( hard sphere model ) or @xmath0 ( marked by the horizontal line).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a simple model for colloid - polymer mixtures is the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite where a hard sphere interaction is assumed between colloids as well as between colloids and polymers while polymer particles do not interact with each other .",
    "the limits of this approximation are discussed elsewhere  @xcite . in this two - component model , the strength of the attractive interactions between the colloids is controlled by the density of polymer particles and the range of attraction by the size ratio between polymers and colloids , @xmath23 ( with @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to the diameter of polymers and colloids , respectively ) .",
    "if one considers the system to be coupled to a polymer reservoir , the fugacity of polymers @xmath24 ( or the polymer reservoir packing fraction @xmath25 ) can be regarded as the analog of inverse temperature in a molecular system and the phase diagram can be displayed in the @xmath26 plane ( corresponding to the temperature - density plane in a molecular system ) . at @xmath27",
    "the coexistence region reduces to the case of pure hard spheres , whereas the increase of the polymer fugacity @xmath24 broadens the coexistence region , corresponding to a higher coexistence packing fraction of the solid phase and a lower one of the fluid phase ( fig .",

    "the ao model provides a good description of a colloid - polymer mixture .",
    "modifications of this model that lead to a more reliable description have been proposed elsewhere @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ao model can be simplified in terms of the computational load by integrating out the polymers degrees of freedom and represent the colloid - polymer mixture as a one - component system of colloidal particles that interact with each other via an effective interaction potential . while for @xmath28 , this potential is a sum of two - body , three - body and higher - body terms , for @xmath29 it reduces to a pair potential given by @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath14 the distance between two colloids and @xmath31 ( with @xmath7 the boltzmann constant ) .    in this work , the fluid - to - solid transition of the hard sphere system and the ao model , as described by the potential ( [ eq_vao ] ) , is studied using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the isothermal - isobaric @xmath32 and @xmath33 ensembles , i.e.  at constant pressure @xmath19 , temperature @xmath8 and particle number @xmath34 ( in the @xmath33 ensemble",

    "mc simulations were carried out using a standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "the trial moves were particle displacements and a rescaling of the volume for one mc cycle @xcite .",
    "the maximum particle displacement was chosen such that the acceptance rate maintained constant at 30% for particle displacements and at 10% for volume s rescaling . to optimize the speed of the simulation for large system sizes , a cell - linked neighbor list was used @xcite .",

    "inhomogeneous systems are prepared where the crystal phase in the middle of an elongated simulation box is surrounded by the fluid phase , separated by two planar interfaces ( note that two interfaces appear due to the use of periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "when solid and liquid are in equilibrium at the pressure @xmath44 , the thermodynamic driving force is zero and the average total volume @xmath45 of the system does not change as a function of time , i.e.  the crystal neither grows nor melts . in this manner ,",
    "@xmath46 can be identified as the pressure where the time derivative @xmath47 vanishes .    to prepare an inhomogeneous system at a given pressure",

    "the crystal grows or melts , dependent on the pressure at which the system is considered , and thus , the coexistence point is estimated as the state where the total volume of the system does not change with time . despite the simplicity of this analysis",
    ", there are several pitfalls when applying this method .",
    "first , interactions between the interfaces due to periodic boundary conditions have to be eliminated .",
    "therefore , we have done test runs with various ratios of @xmath62 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath63 was found to be an optimal choice for the avoidance of interaction effects between the interfaces .",
    "second , finite - size effects need to be quantified to obtain reliable estimates of various properties at coexistence , such as the pressure or the interfacial stiffness .",
    "therefore , we have considered various system sizes with @xmath64 , 4320 , 6860 , 10240 , 20000 , 67500 , and 160000 particles .",
    "third , the crystal - liquid interfaces have to be prepared such that no artificial strains are generated in the crystalline region .",
    "in particular , the use of the isotropic @xmath32 ensemble is not appropriate for the simulation of solid - liquid coexistence .",
    "the uniform volume moves in @xmath32 simulations lead inevitably to strains in the @xmath36 plane of the crystal , since the number of lattice planes can not change in these moves .",
    "thus , the lateral dimensions of the system need to be fixed such that they are commensurate with the chosen integer number of lattice planes ( note that the lattice spacing at a given pressure is known from the bulk simulations of the pure fcc phase ) .",
    "then , the volume is allowed to fluctuate in @xmath65 direction ( perpendicular to the interfaces ) , keeping the pressure in that direction ( @xmath35 ) constant .    to generate crystal - fluid samples at various pressures , first independent solid and fluid samples were simulated .",
    "the solid was put into a simulation box with dimensions @xmath66 , thereby aligning the ( 100 ) plane of the fcc crystal perpendicular to the @xmath65-axis .",
    "the box length @xmath67 was chosen such that it corresponds to the solid density at the considered pressure . at the same density ,",
    "a starting configuration for the fluid was generated by putting the particles randomly in a box of size @xmath68 .",
    "then , the box dimensions of the fluid in @xmath69- and @xmath70-direction were kept fixed and the fluid was equilibrated by a mc simulation in the @xmath33 ensemble .",
    "after @xmath71 mc cycles , solid and fluid samples were sufficiently thermalized and put together into a simulation box of approximate size @xmath72 ( applying periodic boundary conditions in all three spatial dimensions ) , followed by further simulations in the @xmath33 ensemble . in the latter runs , the positions of the solid particles were fixed for the first @xmath16 mc cycles to equilibrate the crystal - fluid interface without melting away the crystal due to an unfavorable local packing of particles in the interface region after matching the fluid slab with the solid slab .",
    "then , the solid particles were released for the rest of the simulation .",

    "first , order parameters have to be identified that allow to distinguish between solid - like and fluid - like local order around a particle .",

    "[ fig13 ] , the prediction ( [ eq_width ] ) is confirmed : both for the hard spheres and the ao mixture , the mean - squared width @xmath125 exhibits a logarithmic divergence with respect to the lateral dimension @xmath67 . within the statistical errors , the two order parameters @xmath106 and @xmath93 yield similar results . from the fits with eq .",
    "( [ eq_width ] ) , we estimate for the ( 100 ) orientation @xmath139k@xmath140 for the hard sphere system and @xmath141k@xmath142 for the ao mixture .",
    "the value of @xmath12 for the hard sphere system roughly agrees with previous estimates , obtained by other methods ( for a discussion of this issue , see refs .",
    "we have investigated the fluid - to - crystal transition of two paradigmatic colloidal model systems using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations at constant pressure .",
    "inhomogeneous systems have been prepared where the crystal phase in the middle of an elongated simulation box is separated from the fluid phase by two interfaces .",
    "we have demonstrated that mc simulations with this setup allow for reliable estimates of the coexistence pressure , @xmath4 , and the interfacial stiffness , @xmath12 . both for the hard sphere system and the ao mixture",
    ", our methodology allows for the simulation of relatively large systems and thus , the coexistence pressure @xmath4 can be computed without relying on error - prone extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand ,",
    "we have presented a method for the calculation of @xmath12 that makes use of finite - size effects due to the capillary - wave broadening of the interface .",
    "so far , this method has been mainly applied to polymer interfaces @xcite , liquid - vapor interfaces @xcite , isotropic - nematic interfaces @xcite or interfaces in ising systems @xcite , but not to solid - fluid interfaces , as in this work ( an exception is of course our recent preliminary work on hard spheres and nickel @xcite ) .",
    "it requires a systematic variation of the system size and relatively small statistical errors to resolve the logarithmic divergence of the mean - squared interfacial width , as predicted in the framework of capillary wave theory ( cwt ) . with respect to the latter issues ,",
    "the determination of @xmath12 is much more difficult for the ao mixture than for the hard sphere system .",
    "first , in the relevant range of colloid packing fractions @xmath49 mass transport processes of the ao fluid in the bulk and in the interface region are much slower than in the hard sphere system .",
    "therefore , much longer simulation runs are necessary for the ao model , to achieve comparable statistics as in the hard sphere system .",
    "second , the interfacial stiffness @xmath12 for the ao model is about a factor of two higher than in the hard sphere system , associated with lower - amplitude capillary fluctuations at comparable system sizes .",
    "thus , the signal - to - noise ratio is worse for the ao model when one analyzes the interfacial fluctuations .",
    "however , despite the latter difficulties , the estimate of @xmath12 from the interfacial broadening works also well for the ao model .",
    "cwt can be of course only applied to the analysis of interfacial properties , if rough , non - faceted interfaces are considered .",
    "otherwise , there would be no divergence of the width of the interface with increasing lateral size of the system .",
    "for the case of the model systems considered in this work , the applicability of cwt is justified since we observe the logarithmic growth of the mean - squared interfacial width as a function of the lateral dimension @xmath67 . to further rationalize the use of cwt , we plan to study the fourier spectrum of interfacial fluctuations from which one can alternatively determine the interfacial stiffness .",
    "moreover , we plan to investigate the possibility of a roughening transition of the ao model where the solid - fluid interface changes from a faceted to a rough interface with long - wavelength capillary wave fluctuations .",
