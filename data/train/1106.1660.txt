    "we can determine kinematic distances for all but two of the h  iiregions in our sample .",
    "kinematic distances are derived using the measured source velocity and a rotation curve model for the galaxy . for all kinematic distances",
    "we use our measured hydrogen rrl velocities ( see table  [ tab : line ] ) and the @xcite rotation curve model . in the inner galaxy ,",
    "rotation curve models have two possible distances for each measured velocity , a `` near '' and a `` far '' distance .",
    "this problem is known as the `` kinematic distance ambiguity , '' or kda , and to resolve it one must use auxiliary data . for h",
    "ii  regions , h  i  along the line of sight , which emits at 21@xmath16 , will absorb against the broadband h  ii  region continuum . h  i  is nearly ubiquitous in our galaxy and emits at all allowed velocities .",
    "the maximum velocity of detected absorption in an h  i  spectrum in the direction of an h  ii  region can distinguish between the near and the far distance ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we conclude that the near distance is more consistent with the h  i  absorption spectrum , whereas for s90 the h  i  absorption spectrum supports the far distance . for two additional inner galaxy sources",
    "not included in @xcite , s76 and w48 , there is no public h  i  data at sufficient angular resolution to perform the h  ie / a method .",
    "for these two sources , we assume the kda resolution given in @xcite and place both sources at the near kinematic distance .",
    "one additional source , g39.728@xmath170.396 , is part of the gbt h  ii  region discovery survey @xcite , and we use the far kinematic distance from l.anderson et al .",

    "there are seven h  ii  regions whose rrl velocity is within 10@xmath18  of the tangent point velocity , which is the maximum velocity along the line of sight : g78.03 + 0.6 , g79.42 + 2.4 , g80.88 + 0.4 , g81.25 + 1.1 , s106 , s108 , and s112 .",
    "the kda resolutions for such sources are unreliable and we therefore locate them at the tangent point distance .",
    "the remaining 62 sources are in the outer galaxy and are thus not affected by the kda .",
    "there are two sources with kinematic distances that are clearly incorrect .",
    "for orion  a ( `` oria '' in tables  [ tab : prop]-[tab : cont ] ) , the measured rrl velocity of @xmath19@xmath18  is not defined for its galactic location in the @xcite rotation curve .",
    "we instead use a distance of 0.4@xmath0@xcite , which was derived using vlbi maser parallax measurements .",
    "s235 is located near the galactic anti - center and the measured velocity of @xmath20@xmath18  produces an unreliable kinematic distance using the @xcite rotation curve .",
    "we instead use a distance of 1.6@xmath0  for this source @xcite , as in @xcite .",
    "we choose to use kinematic distances here since we are able to derive kinematic distances to almost all of our sources , thus providing a homogeneous sample for our electron temperature analysis .",
    "the radial gradients , moreover , do not suffer from the kda since they only depend on @xmath11 . reliably detecting azimuthal structure , however , does require @xmath12  and that we resolve the kda . in future work we shall make further analyzes of the galactic distribution of nebular @xmath14  by including spectroscopic and trigonometric parallaxes , especially those made using vlbi measurements of h  ii  region masers .",
    "it is the case , however , that the @xmath21% errors typically found for kinematic distances are much smaller than the separation between a source s near and far kinematic distance .",
    "we should thus have sufficient accuracy in the distances that we use here to resolve azimuthal structure in the @xmath14  distribution on scales of approximately a few kpc .",
    "here we discuss rrl and continuum observations at x - band ( 8 to 10@xmath22 ) toward 81 galactic h  ii  regions with the gbt .",
    "the spectral line data consist of total power , position switched spectra in which a reference position ( off ) was observed offset @xmath23 minutes in right ascension from the source and then the target position ( on ) was observed .",
    "the reference and target positions were observed for 6 minutes each for a total of 12 minutes . the gbt auto - correlation spectrometer ( acs )",

    "these spectra included 7 hn@xmath26 rrls ( 87  to 93 ) that span the range of the x - band receiver with half - power beam - widths ( hpbws ) from 73 to 90 arcsec .. this sub - band includes the h114@xmath27 and h130@xmath28 rrls that are used to monitor system performance . ] the center rest frequencies were : 8045.60495992323 , 8300.0 , 8584.82315062037 , 8665.3 , 8877.0 , 9183.0 , 9505.0 , and 9812.0 mhz .",
    "we measured the h  ii  region continuum emission with the gbt digital continuum receiver ( dcr ) by scanning in r.a . and decl .",
    "through the center of the source at a frequency of 8665@xmath24  and a bandwidth of 320@xmath24 .",
    "the catalog target coordinates were updated based on gbt pointing observations in r.a .",
    "and decl.that is , we peaked up on each h  ii  region .",
    "each continuum observation consisted of 4 scans , whereby the telescope was driven at a rate of 80 arcmin per minute in both the forward and backward directions in r.a .",
    "and then in decl .",
    "data were simultaneously taken at two orthogonal , circular polarizations and were sampled every 0.1s  over an angular path 40 arcmin in length .",
    "details of the data reduction and calibration are discussed in appendix  [ sec : app ] . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio the 7 hn@xmath26 rrls were averaged . in the final averaged rrl spectra we excluded the h90@xmath26 rrl because nearby , higher order rrls made it difficult to measure a good spectral baseline .",
    "the averaging process required three steps : ( 1 ) the velocity scale of the 88  to 93  rrls were re - gridded to the velocity scale of the 87  rrl ; ( 2 ) the rrl spectra were shifted to match the doppler tracked 89  rrl ; and ( 3 ) the intensity scale was adjusted to correct for the different hpbws by assuming gaussian source brightness distributions and hpbws .",
    "the primary goal here is to calculate the nebular electron temperature which is a function of the line - to - continuum ratio .",
    "since the electron temperature is derived from this ratio of two intensities , many observing errors cancel and therefore a relative flux scale calibration is sufficient .",
    "we used all target sources with a continuum antenna temperature @xmath29@xmath30  to derive an average relative calibration accurate to within 5% .",
    "the data were analyzed using tmbidl , an idl single - dish software package .",
    "the line and continuum parameters were determined after the data reduction and calibration .",

    "the qf is a measure of data quality taking into account the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath41 , the baselines , confusion , and the gaussian fit .",
    "the errors in the gaussian fit and the @xmath38 baseline noise yield a quantitative measure of the data quality , but these metrics do not assess systematic uncertainties .",
    "for example , a poor fit of the baseline can result in significant errors in the peak intensity that are not reflected by the formal errors .",
    "for the continuum data the qf was determined by visual inspection of the data , including the baseline and gaussian fits as is described in @xcite .",
    "the qf scale ranges from a ( excellent ) to d ( poor )",
    ".    visual inspection of the spectral line data revealed little variation in the quality of the spectral baselines  the spectral baselines were excellent . unlike the 140 foot telescope spectra",
    ", the unblocked aperture of the gbt yields significantly improved spectral baselines .",
    "moreover , we selected h  ii  region targets with a single component h rrl so there was no line confusion . for these reasons we derived the qf for the h rrls quantitatively using the @xmath41 and the percent error in the gaussian fit of the line area , @xmath42 .",
    "we assigned the spectral line qf in the following way : a ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) ; b ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) ; c ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) ; or d otherwise . the qf s are listed in the last column of tables  [ tab : line ] and [ tab : cont ] .",

    ", the lte electron temperature should be a very good approximation to the real average nebular electron temperature .",
    "non - lte effects , such as stimulated emission and pressure broadening from electron impacts should be small .",
    "helium rrl emission was not detected in 27 of the 81 h  ii  regions . in these cases",
    "we estimated an upper limit for @xmath13 by assuming @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is consistent with gas at @xmath14  = 8000@xmath30  and a hydrogen fwhm line width of 25@xmath18 . in all cases",
    "the upper limit is larger than the canonical value of the he / h abundance ratio ( 0.08 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that we lack the sensitivity to detect helium emission in these objects and not that these h  ii  regions have low excitation . for sources with no detected helium emission we therefore assume @xmath56 and list them with zero errors in table  [ tab : prop ]",
    "nonetheless , the electron temperature is not very sensitive to @xmath13 . using equation  [ eq : te ] and parameter values typical of our h  ii  region sample , a 10% change in @xmath13 results in only a 0.6% change in @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross - cal ] compares the electron temperatures derived for nebulae that are in both the gbt and 140 foot samples .",
    "we only plot sources that have a qf of c or better for both line and continuum data . for these 16 objects",
    "the mean value of the electron temperature is @xmath57@xmath30  and @xmath58@xmath30  for the gbt sample and the 140 foot sample , respectively .",
    "while there is no systematic variation in electron temperature there are differences in @xmath14 that are significantly larger than the formal error .",
    "the error bars shown in figure  [ fig : cross - cal ] correspond to the measurement errors and do not include calibration errors .",
    "we estimate that errors in @xmath14 due to calibration are less than 5% for the gbt ( see appendix b ) and less than 10% for the 140 foot telescope ( see  5.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "since the telescope hpbw s vary by a factor of 2.4 , moreover , we are sampling different volumes of nebular gas and so can not rule out true fluctuations in @xmath14 within each nebula that can vary by as much as 10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the electron temperature radial gradient is plotted in figure  [ fig : tergal ] for the gbt sample ( top panel ) and the green bank sample ( bottom panel ) . only sources with qfs c or better for both the line and continuum data are included . for clarity we do not display the electron temperature errors which are typically less than 5% .",
    "as was also found by @xcite , these errors are significantly smaller than the dispersion of the data points .",
    "for example , using the gbt sample the @xmath38 of the measured electron temperatures relative to the fitted value is 854@xmath30 , or 9% of the mean electron temperature .",
    "the dispersion for the green bank sample is larger , especially for @xmath59@xmath0 .",
    "this can be explained by the presence of azimuthal structure because the azimuth range sampled by our h  ii  regions with @xmath59@xmath0  is larger ( see figure  [ fig : azrgal ] and below ) .",

    "this corresponds to a 20% change in @xmath14  for s209n and a 10% change in the slope . since @xmath71@xmath0  for s209n it has significant leverage in the fit for @xmath62 .",
    "we explored azimuthal structure in the electron temperature gradient by dividing the data into three azimuth ranges : @xmath72 ; @xmath73 ; and @xmath74 .",

    "we excluded the 90  rrl sub - band since it was difficult to determine a good baseline near the carbon rrl due to nearby higher order rrls .",
    "we calculated ratios of @xmath164 for h91/ih91 ( ll ) ; @xmath165 for h91/ih91 ( rr ) ; @xmath166 for h91/ah91 ( ll ) ; and @xmath167 for h91/ah91 ( rr ) .",
    "to within the uncertainty the h91 and ih91 intensities are identical  this should be the case if the interpolation is done properly .",
    "there is a measurable systematic offset when comparing the h91/ah91 ratios , however , that should stem from errors in the @xmath160 values and any systematic errors in our averaging technique .",
    "these offsets are less than 5% .",
    "there is no systematic effect of these ratios with respect to either the continuum intensity or angular size .",
    "the dispersion in h91/ah91 is a result of fitting spectral baselines and gaussian profiles , random noise , weather fluctuations , elevation gain fluctuations , etc .",
    "it is therefore a good measure of the uncertainties in our observing and data analysis procedures .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol ] plots the rrl polarization ratios , ll / rr , for h91 , ih91 , and ah91 .",
    "we calculate polarization ratios of @xmath168 for h91 ; @xmath169 for ih91 ; and @xmath170 for ah91 .",
    "the polarization ratios are also not a function of either the continuum intensity or angular size .",
    "the h91 polarization ratios are about 3% from unity , well within the expected @xmath160 uncertainties of 10% .",
    "the polarization ratios for the other rrls show similar results . to within the uncertainty the h91 and ih91 polarizations ratios",
    "are identical , again as expected .",
    "the ah91 polarization ratios are within 2% of unity , consistent with random errors in @xmath160 .",
    "that is , if the errors in determining @xmath160 are random they should average to unity given enough rrl sub - bands .",
    "moreover , the dispersion in the distribution should decrease as @xmath171 . from figure",
    "[ fig : pol ] we see a decrease in the dispersion from 0.0101 to 0.0043 when we compare the single sub - band h91 to the averaged ah91 .",
    "this is consistent with the six rrl sub - bands used in the average .",
    "based on the h91/ah91 ratios for each polarization we derived and applied corrections factors of cf = @xmath166 for ll and cf = @xmath167 for rr .",
    "overall we deem that the relative calibration scale is accurate to within 5% .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of our derived electron temperatures by calculating both measurement and calibration errors .",
    "the measurement errors are listed in table  [ tab : prop ] and were calculated by propagating the uncertainty in the hydrogen and helium rrl line intensity and width , together with the continuum intensity uncertainty .",
    "the average measurement error is @xmath172 with respect to the electron temperature .",
    "the calibration errors are estimated to be @xmath173 ( see  [ sec : cal ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of our electron temperatures should therefore be @xmath174% or better .",
    "this does not include systematic errors which are difficult to determine .",
    "if we could estimate any systematic error we would remove it !",
    "our sources , however , were selected to minimize potential systematic errors .",
    "for example , determining the baseline or zero level for the continuum intensity is one potential source of systematic error .",
    "this is particularly difficult for sources located in complex regions where extended emission often exists in the baseline region . for such cases our data analysis procedures will systematically underestimate the continuum intensity and therefore the electron temperature .",
