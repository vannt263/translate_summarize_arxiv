    "here we present the slave - fermion mean - field results for the @xmath59 model with @xmath33 , that allow us to interpret the physical origin of the kinetic antiferromagnetism found numerically with the dmrg method .",
    "first , we briefly introduce the slave - fermion mean - field treatment @xcite of the @xmath59 model , @xmath104 where the sum @xmath105 is over all the @xmath65 sites of the cluster and all the @xmath80 neighbors connected with @xmath65 by the exchange interaction @xmath106 and hopping term @xmath107 the @xmath59 model is the strong coupling @xmath108 limit of the hubbard model , with @xmath109 , and it is written in terms of the projected electronic operators , @xmath110 with @xmath111 forbidding the electronic double occupancy at each site . for @xmath3 , @xmath112 , and both models are identical .",
    "the projected electronic operators can be represented in term of schwinger bosons @xmath113 and spinless fermions @xmath114 @xmath115 this replacement , together with the constraint @xmath116 at each site @xmath65 , is a faithful representation of the original fermi algebra .",
    "the spin can be written in terms of the schwinger bosons as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the vector of pauli matrices , while the slave fermion @xmath119 corresponds to the charge ( hole ) degree of freedom .",
    "we replace ( [ cproj ] ) in the @xmath59 hamiltonian ( [ tj ] ) and we obtain @xmath120 ,   \\label{tjslave}\\ ] ] where we have defined the singlet @xmath6 operators @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xcite , while @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) is related with the antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) correlations between sites @xmath65 and @xmath126 , while @xmath127 represents the probability that a hole hopes from @xmath65 to @xmath126 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ tjslave ] ) involves quartic terms in slave operators , and thus we appeal to a mean - field decoupling @xcite in order to solve it approximately . also , we approximate the local constraint ( [ const ] ) by its average over all the lattice , enforced by a lagrange multiplier @xmath128 .",
    "the resulting mean - field hamiltonian is @xmath129 to obtain this expression we replace the bilinear operators @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 by its ( real ) averages , assuming a translational invariant solution . also , we introduce the chemical potential @xmath133 to control the hole doping @xmath134 . after transforming to the fourier space , we get @xmath135 + { \\rm cte . } ,   \\label{tjk}\\ ] ] where the hole dispersion is @xmath136 while @xmath137 and @xmath138    now we have a quadratic hamiltonian ( [ tjk ] ) , that can be straightforwardly diagonalized by means of a bogoliubov transformation of the schwinger bosons to new bosonic operators @xmath139 s @xcite : @xmath140 where the boson dispersion is @xmath141 finally , the mean field parameters @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 can be computed in a self consistent way @xcite .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ mf ] ) approximates the complicated @xmath59 model by two one - body terms : a fermionic tight - binding - like one , describing the motion of holes , and a bosonic term , corresponding to the spin fluctuations of the system .",
    "it should be noticed that both terms are interdependent , as the hole dispersion depends on the ferromagnetic parameter @xmath82 while the bosonic dispersion depends on @xmath144 , providing a coupling between the charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "once we obtain the mean field hamiltonian , it is a simple task to calculate the ground state physical properties of the system as a function of @xmath73 , @xmath145 and hole doping , @xmath146 in particular , the existence of magnetic order is manifested in the bose - einstein condensation of the bosons at @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the magnetic wave vector @xcite . in fig . 2 of the manuscript we show the mean field local magnetization of the triangular @xmath59 model as a function of @xmath149 in order to illustrate the ordering effect of kinetic antiferromagnetism in this lattice .",
    "in a future publication @xcite , we will present a detailed study of the mean field phase diagram of the @xmath59 model on the triangular and square lattices . hereafter",
    ", we report the mean field results for the special case of interest in this work , that is , @xmath33 .",
    "nel , ferromagnetic , and the collinear stripe order , for @xmath33 and @xmath4 in the triangular lattice.,width=264 ]    for @xmath33 , the @xmath150 factors vanish identically , consequently hamiltonian ( [ tjk ] ) is already diagonal and there is no need of a bogoliubov transformation . instead",
    ", it is imperative to condense the schwinger bosons , in order to satisfy the averaged constraint ( [ const ] ) . considering bose condensation at different momenta @xmath151",
    ", we can calculate the energy of magnetic phases ( if the phases are locally stable , that is , they satisfy the self - consistent mean - field equations ) characterized by different magnetic wave vectors @xmath148 s . in particular , for the triangular lattice and @xmath85 , we evaluate the energy of the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath152 ) , the @xmath2 nel order ( @xmath153 ) , and a collinear stripe order ( @xmath154 ) , that is favorable for intermediate doping and @xmath95 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ enertpos ] we show the energy _ per site _ of the three phases as a function of hole doping , calculated for a large cluster ( @xmath155 sites ) that represents the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it can be seen that , at the mean - field level , the ferromagnetic phase is the ground state for all the doping range considered , although the 120@xmath89 nel order has a very close energy for doping @xmath156 .",
    "the collinear stripe phase always has a much larger energy , and so it is not stabilized by the kinetic energy alone .",
    "it should be stressed that after an exhaustive search for solutions of the mean - field equations for finite doping , we have always found that the ferromagnetic phase is the ground state . in the case of only one hole doped away half - filling , we will show in the next section that the ferromagnetic phase is degenerate with the @xmath2 nel order .",
    "the energy of both phases is @xmath157 ; while this is the exact ferromagnetic phase energy , it is clearly rather above the exact 120@xmath89 nel phase energy found by our dmrg calculations and exact diagonalization @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to note that , once @xmath158 , the 120@xmath89 nel state is strongly favored over the ferromagnetic one @xcite , because the exchange interaction select the 120@xmath89 magnetic pattern in the triangular lattice @xcite .    for @xmath159",
    ", it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ enertneg ] that the ferromagnetic phase is also the ground state for all doping , but now its energy is well separated from the energies of the other phases considered ( 120@xmath89 nel phase and a representative spiral phase , with magnetic wave vector @xmath160 ) . for negative @xmath11 nagaoka s theorem is valid , and it is believed that ferromagnetism is very stable for further doping @xcite .",
    "nel , ferromagnetic , and spiral @xmath160 phases , for @xmath33 and @xmath161 in the triangular lattice.,width=264 ]    so , for @xmath85 and @xmath162 the mean - field approximation does not capture that @xmath2 nel order is the unique ground state , as it is degenerate with the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this failure has to do with the mean - field character of the approach , in which we approximate the actual many - body problem by one - body terms . from previous experience @xcite",
    ", we expect that the inclusion of gaussian fluctuations above the mean - field solutions will put the slave - fermion predictions in consonance with our dmrg and exact diagonalization @xcite results , lowering the 120@xmath89 nel energy while leaving unchanged the already exact ferromagnetic energy .",
    "for the @xmath59 model on the square lattice with first and second neighbor hoppings , with @xmath112 and @xmath163 , we obtained analogous results to the triangular lattice . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the ferromagnetic phase is clearly the ground state , in accordance with the nagaoka s theorem . for @xmath164",
    "although the ferromagnetic phase is the ground state for all doping considered ( @xmath165 ) , its energy is very close to the energy of the usual @xmath166 nel state , being both states degenerate for one hole doped away half - filling .",
    "again , this result does not agree with the dmrg prediction of a unique antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "although the mean - field theory fails to obtain the correct antiferromagnetic ground states for @xmath33 , in the next section we argue that it is a very helpful approach to elucidate the physical mechanism behind the phenomenon of kinetic antiferromagnetism .",
    "in this section we limit ourselves to the case of one hole doped , relevant for our work .",
    "we analyze why the 120@xmath89 nel order ( @xmath166 ) is one of the ground states , along with the ferromagnetic one , of the mean field hamiltonian ( [ tjk ] ) for the triangular lattice ( square lattice ) .",
    "the answer lies in the release of the hole kinetic energy frustration thanks to the hole motion on the antiferromagnetic background , and we believe that this mechanism can be used to interpret the kinetic antiferromagnetism . in the one hole case , the ground state energy of the system corresponds to the energy of the bottom of the hole dispersion , @xmath74 ( [ edisp ] ) .",
    "this energy dispersion is a tight - binding like , with the hopping terms @xmath73 renormalized by the ferromagnetic mean - field parameter @xmath75 @xmath76 . on one hand , this renormalization can induce a spin - berry phase , while , on the other hand , it could lead to the vanishing of the hopping amplitude between certain neighbor sites . although , the mechanism is the same for both lattices , the details differ , so we analyze each case separately .        for @xmath162",
    "the analysis of the mean - field equations shows that the @xmath82 parameters take their classical values , @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "so , for the ferromagnetic phase , @xmath152 , the hole dispersion takes the form @xmath173,\\ ] ] while for the 120@xmath89 nel order , @xmath174 , @xmath175.\\ ] ]    the minimum and maximum ( maximum and minimum ) of the ferromagnetic energy dispersion occur at the momenta @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively , for @xmath4 ( @xmath159 ) : @xmath178 as a consequence , the hole motion is frustrated ( unfrustrated ) for @xmath85 ( @xmath159 ) .      in the 120@xmath89 nel phase , on one hand , the hole dispersion bandwidth is halved .",
    "this results from the fact that the effective hopping @xmath81 between sites @xmath65 and @xmath126 is proportional , through the modulus of @xmath82 , to the overlap of the spin wavefunctions pointing in the direction of the local magnetization at each site , similar to what happens in the double exchange mechanism @xcite , @xmath183 where @xmath79 is the angle between spins at sites @xmath65 and @xmath126 . on the other hand",
    ", the negative sign acquired by the @xmath184 parameter turns upside down the hole dispersion with respect to the ferromagnetic case .    as the energy of @xmath59 model , with @xmath33 and one hole",
    "doped away half - filling , coincides with the bottom of the hole dispersion energy , for @xmath159 the ferromagnetic phase is the ground state , with a significantly lower energy than the 120@xmath89 nel state .",
    "the mean - field approximation gets the exact ground state energy , @xmath185 , and it satisfies nagaoka s theorem . as it is shown in fig .",
    "( [ enertneg ] ) ferromagnetism clearly prevails for further doping .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath93 the hole motion in the ferromagnetic state is frustrated , while the kinetic energy frustration is released in the 120@xmath89 state thanks to the negative @xmath184 parameter . at the mean - field level",
    "this release gives rise to the degeneracy of the ferromagnetic and the 120@xmath89 nel phases . while the mean - field ferromagnetic energy is the exact one ( @xmath186 ) , the mean - field energy of the 120@xmath89 state is approximate , and it is necessary to use more sophisticated techniques beyond mean - field , like the dmrg computations we perform in our work or the exact diagonalization by haerter and shastry @xcite , to capture the stabilization of the 120@xmath89 phase over the ferromagnetic one .",
    "it is worth to notice that the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the 120@xmath89 phases computed by dmrg , @xmath187 , is relatively large ( @xmath188 of the ferromagnetic energy ) , indicating that many - body effects beyond mean - field are really important .    in spite of this discrepancy of the mean - field approximation",
    ", we believe that it is a very helpful approach because we can extract from it the main ingredient of the physical mechanism that gives rise to the kinetic antiferromagnetism in these extremely correlated systems : in kinetically frustrated situations when nagaoka s theorem is not valid , the kinetic frustration can be released if the hole moves in certain antiferromagnetic backgrounds , lowering its energy with respect to the ferromagnetic state ( when quantum fluctuations beyond mean - field are considered ) .",
    "the sum of the ( complex ) phases of the @xmath82 parameters around a closed loop is the spin - berry phase acquired by the hole when it runs through the loop , and it is also half the solid angle subtended by the spins on the loop @xcite . while in the ferromagnetic phase ( like in any collinear phase ) the subtended solid angle vanishes , in the 120@xmath89 nel phase this angle is @xmath189 for each unit triangle , and its associated spin - berry phase is @xmath190 ( related to the negative sign of @xmath184 @xcite ) .",
    "so , we can summarize that in the triangular lattice the mechanism of kinetic antiferromagnetism consists in the release of the kinetic frustration by means of the spin - berry phase acquired by the hole as it moves along the 120@xmath89 magnetic pattern .      in the square lattice with hopping terms to first and second neighbors",
    ", the hole dispersion ( [ edisp ] ) is @xmath191 + 4t_2\\left[b_3 \\cos\\left(k_x+k_y\\right)+   b_4 \\cos\\left(-k_x+k_y\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where the @xmath168 s parameters correspond to the first neighbors @xmath169 and @xmath192 , and to the second neighbors , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "as the @xmath12 sign is irrelevant , we take @xmath197 in the following . for @xmath198 ,",
    "the minimum ( maximum ) of the ferromagnetic energy dispersion occurs at the momenta , @xmath199 or @xmath39 ( @xmath200 ) for @xmath201 @xmath202 while for @xmath40 the minimum ( maximum ) occurs at the momenta @xmath203 ( @xmath199 or @xmath39 ) : @xmath204      for the @xmath166 nel phase , the first neighbor @xmath82 parameters vanish identically because of the antiparallel orientation of the spins , while @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , the hole dispersion is @xmath208 as it is well known for this kind of mean - field approximations , the holes can only propagate along the ferromagnetic sublattices .",
    "the minimum and maximum ( maximum and minimum ) of the hole dispersion now are located at momenta @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively , for @xmath88 ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath211    for @xmath40 , the unique ground state of the @xmath59 model , with @xmath33 and one - hole doped away half - filling , is the ferromagnetic phase , with the optimal kinetic energy @xmath212 well separated from the nel phase energy ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "as in the triangular case , the mean - field approximation gives the exact ground state energy and satisfies nagaoka s theorem .",
    "for @xmath88 the ferromagnetic and nel states are degenerate at the mean field level ( @xmath214 ) . as in the triangular case ,",
    "the ferromagnetic phase mean - field energy is the exact one , while the mean - field nel energy is approximate .",
    "our dmrg computations shows that the nel phase is the true ground state , with an energy @xmath215 well below the mean - field value .    in the square lattice model",
    ", we can also conclude that the origin of the kinetic antiferromagnetism is intimately related with the release of the kinetic energy frustration in the nel phase . in this case ,",
    "the kinetic frustration release is caused by the vanishing of the frustrating first neighbor hopping amplitudes in the @xmath166 nel state , and not by the appearance of a non - trivial spin - berry phase like in the triangular lattice .",
    "so far , we have found two examples",
    "where if the @xmath59 model with @xmath33 equivalently , the @xmath3 hubbard model is kinetically frustrated , there is a ground state degeneracy between a determined antiferromagnetic state and the ferromagnetic one at the mean field level .",
    "the selected antiferromagnetic state is the one which allows the release of the kinetic frustration .",
    "our dmrg calculations allow us to affirm that in these cases , the antiferromagnetic state is the true ground state of the model , indicating that the phenomenon of kinetic antiferromagnetism seems to be quite ubiquitous in kinetically frustrated systems . here , we briefly extend this kind of reasoning to other systems .",
    "* we consider the mean - field analysis for the square lattice model with arbitrary @xmath216 .",
    "we find that for any negative @xmath13 there is no kinetic frustration and , therefore , the nagaoka ferromagnetic state is the unique ground state . on the other hand , for positive @xmath13",
    "there is kinetic frustration . if @xmath217 ( @xmath12 sign is irrelevant ) the usual @xmath5 nel and the ferromagnetic states are degenerate , while if @xmath218 the ferromagnetic phase is the only ground state , with an energy difference relative to the nel phase , @xmath219 based in the previous examples , we expect that , in an exact calculation , the @xmath5 nel phase will be the ( only ) ground state for @xmath217 .",
    "we can push further our prediction : the ferromagnetic energy is the exact one , while the antiferromagnetic energy can still decrease if we go beyond the mean - field approximation , and taking into account that previous dmrg computations give energy differences between the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic states of the order of @xmath220 , we propose that the nel state will be the ground state as long as @xmath221 , that is , for @xmath222 .",
    "our preliminary dmrg results confirm this prediction , as we find that for @xmath223 the ground state has @xmath5 nel order , while for @xmath224 the ground state is ferromagnetic . *",
    "the anisotropic triangular lattice has hopping @xmath11 along the @xmath225 vectors , and @xmath226 along the @xmath227 and @xmath228 vectors . for negative @xmath11 , independently of the @xmath226 sign , the system is kinetically unfrustrated and the mean - field approach yields a ferromagnetic ground state , with an energy well separated from the antiferromagnetic phases . for positive",
    "@xmath11 , the kinetic energy is frustrated , and we find two different mean - field regimes : _ i _ ) for @xmath229 the ferromagnetic state is degenerate with a spiral phase characterized by a wave vector @xmath230 with @xmath231 going continuously from 0 ( @xmath232 ) to @xmath189 ( @xmath233 ) ; _ ii _ ) for @xmath234 the ferromagnetic phase is the only ground state . drawing on arguments similar to those put forward in the @xmath91 square lattice model",
    ", we expect a kinetic antiferromagnetic ground state for @xmath235 and a ground state with ferromagnetic order for @xmath236 .",
    "preliminary dmrg results confirm again this prediction , but the wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phases are different from the mean - field ones .",
    "dmrg yield a 120@xmath89 nel order for @xmath237 while @xmath238 for @xmath239 with @xmath231 going from @xmath240 ( @xmath241 ) to @xmath242 ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "the prevalence of the 120@xmath89 nel phase would indicate that this order optimize the release of the kinetic energy frustration , but more work is needed to assert this affirmation .",
    "* finally we consider the @xmath3 hubbard model on the kagom lattice . for negative @xmath11",
    "there is no kinetic frustration , and the mean - field recovers the exact nagaoka ground state , while for positive @xmath11 we find that the ferromagnetic phase is degenerate with mean - field 120@xmath89 magnetic orders , like the @xmath244 and @xmath245 states @xcite .",
    "we speculate that , at the mean - field level , any state that obeys the condition of zero total spin at each triangle , that is , any classical ground state of the kagom heisenberg model , will be degenerate in energy with the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we leave for future investigations the very interesting analysis of kinetic antiferromagnetism on the kagom lattice .",

    "<S> @xmath68 is a bosonic term that represents the spin fluctuations due to the heisenberg term , and it vanishes when @xmath69 @xcite . after a mean field decoupling , we get @xmath70 where the hole kinetic energy dispersion takes the form @xmath71 ( @xmath72 are the relative position vectors of the sites connected by @xmath73 ) .    in the one hole case , the ground state energy of the system corresponds to the bottom of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this energy dispersion is tight - binding like , with the hopping terms @xmath73 renormalized by the ferromagnetic mean - field parameter @xmath75 @xmath76 . </S>",

    "<S> when the system is kinetically frustrated , these two features of the hopping renormalizations act releasing the hole kinetic energy frustration as the hole moves through certain antiferromagnetic patterns . </S>",
    "<S> now we describe how this release works in the triangular and square lattice cases . _ </S>",
    "<S> triangular lattice : _ for the ferromagnetic state all @xmath83 parameters are equal to @xmath84 , consequently the hole motion is frustrated for @xmath85 . on the other hand , in a @xmath2 nel order </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath86 become negative and the others remain positive since @xmath87 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these negative @xmath77 s turn upside down the hole dispersion , releasing the kinetic frustration of the hole motion . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the flux of the @xmath77 s parameters in a closed loop is the solid angle subtended by the magnetic order , and consequently it is associated with the spin - berry phase detected by the hole ( see supplemental material for details @xcite ) . _ </S>",
    "<S> square lattice : _ in this case , when @xmath88 the hole motion in a ferromagnetic state is frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the @xmath5 nel order the vanishing of the effective first - neighbor hopping terms , due to their antiparallel spins @xcite , removes the frustrating loops , releasing the kinetic frustration .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that , at the mean field level , the 120@xmath89 nel ( @xmath5 nel ) state is degenerate with the ferromagnetic one in the triangular case with @xmath85 ( square lattice with @xmath90 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this degeneracy is that , although the hole motion through the antiferromagnetic states is not frustrated , there is a hole dispersion bandwidth reduction due to the hopping renormalizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , strictly speaking , the mean field numerics does not show the stabilization of the kinetic antiferromagnetism over the nagaoka s state . however , after considering the combined effects of quantum interference and strong - correlation physics beyond the mean field approximation ( like our dmrg predictions ) , the actual kinetic antiferromagnetism emerges . </S>",
    "<S> despite the mean field discrepancy , we strongly emphasize that the mean field approach allows to find one of the main ingredient of the kinetic antiferromagnetism , that is , the release of the kinetic frustration .    using the insight we gained from the mean field approach </S>",
    "<S> , we can predict the appearence of this novel kinetic antiferromagnetism phenomenon in other kinetically frustrated systems , like the anisotropic triangular lattice and the @xmath91 square lattice with @xmath92 preliminary dmrg results show the ubiquity of kinetic antiferromagnetism in these systems ( see supplemmental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we remark that the kinetic antiferromagnetism mechanism is completely different to the exchange one , and in general the ground state selected by this itinerant mechanism does not have to be necessarily the classical ground state of the related heisenberg model . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath3 kagom hubbard model with one hole doped and @xmath93 may be a promising candidate for the search of unconventional kinetic antiferromagnetism physics @xcite .    finally , if we lift the condition of infinite @xmath94 it is possible to study the synergy between _ real _ and _ virtual _ kinetic processes , in order to highlight the crossover from the heisenberg regime , governed by the exchange interactions , to the kinetic antiferromagnetic one , governed by the kinetic energy . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show the local magnetization of the ground state @xmath2 nel order of the triangular @xmath59 model predicted by the mean field approach and dmrg @xcite , as a function of @xmath95 for doping @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> there is fairly good qualitative agreement between both methods , and for larger values of @xmath95 the order parameter is close to the heisenberg value calculated within each approach , @xmath97 @xcite and @xmath98 @xcite , while @xmath46 increases with decreasing @xmath95 , until it reaches the classical value for @xmath99 in both methods </S>",

    "<S> the arrows indicate the @xmath33 and heisenberg @xmath46 limits.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    _ conclusions . _ using the density matrix renormalization group </S>",
    "<S> , we find that classical antiferromagnetic ground states can be realized in extremely correlated electronic systems with frustrated kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the @xmath3 hubbard model , with one hole doped away half filling , on the positive @xmath11 triangular lattice , and on the square lattice with positive second neighbor hoppings . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a mechanism responsible for this kinetic antiferromagnetism , that is , the release of the kinetic energy frustration driven by , depending on the system , the spin - berry phase acquired by the hole while moving around an antiferromagnetic background , or the vanishing of the effective hopping amplitude along the frustrating loops . </S>",
    "<S> this new mechanism for itinerant antiferromagnetism is quite ubiquitous for one hole doped away half filling in kinetically frustrated lattices @xcite , being also relevant in more general situations , like finite @xmath0 regime and low doping cases , as the mean - field results seem to indicate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that recent experiments @xcite were able to generate gauge fields which induce frustrated motion of ultracold bosons in triangular optical lattices , opening up the possibility to observe related kinetic antiferromagnetism phenomena .    </S>",
