    "hydrostatic equilibrium in physical systems bound by newtonian gravitation is achieved essentially under electrically neutral conditions@xmath2 .",
    "a comparison between the repulsive coulomb force and the attractive gravitational force shows that for systems such as the sun , charge accumulation can not be significantly larger than @xmath3 . for systems with intense gravitational field such as compact stars",
    "the newtonian theory does not lead to correct equilibrium conditions , here modifications in the gravitational field equations consistent with the general theory of relativity must be introduced .",
    "this leads to the general relativistic hydrostatic conditions ( the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff or tov equations ) for equilibrium in relativistic stars .",
    "the relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium conditions for electrically charged systems imply that charge contained by these systems can be very large .",
    "it is estimated that both in non - rotating as well as rotating cases@xmath4 the amount of net charge contained in a compact charged star can be as high as @xmath0 .  in case of a non - rotating charged compact star ( electar )",
    "the spacetime is modified by the electrical energy density . here",
    "the effect of charge appears as an addition to the total mass of the star(system ) , hence the its energy density .",
    "for rotating gravitational systems frame - dragging of spacetime is a typically relativistic effect with no analogue in classical theories of gravitation@xmath5 . in the case of a neutral massive object , a neutron star for instance , the spacetime dragging effects both material as well as radiative processes in vicinity of the star .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of charge on the spacetime outside a rotating electrically charged relativistic system , such as a charged compact star .",
    "in particular we ask if the dragging of spacetime influenced by the presence of electric charge on a relativistic star . in section 2",
    "the problem is formulated assuming a slowly rotating mass with an axially symmetric metric describing the spacetime around the gravitational source .",
    "the form of the metric is then determined using einstein field equations coupled to the maxwell equations .",
    "this leads to a modified formula for lense - thirring spacetime dragging frequency , given in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the main conclusions and give a summary of the paper .",
    "we consider an electrically charged , slowly rotating star of total mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 enclosing a net electric charge @xmath8 . the spacetime exterior to the star",
    "is described by the metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dragging frequency of a local inertial frame at the location @xmath11 outside the star .",
    "the spacetime exterior to the charged star will be explicitly determined using the coupled einstein - maxwell equations , @xmath12 supplemented with the stress energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field given by @xmath13 where the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath14 is given by the maxwell equations : @xmath15 for electric charge density @xmath16 we define the electric field @xmath17 as @xmath18 then for the components @xmath19 and @xmath20 the stress tensor can be expressed as @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the electric energy density of the star . for @xmath23",
    "the spherical symmetric parts of the einstein field equation coupled to the maxwell equation give @xmath24 @xmath25 the first of einstein field equations gives the metric component @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the modified mass . also adding these two equations together and solving the resulting expression we get @xmath29 .",
    "corresponding to the axially symmetric part of the einstein field equations @xmath30 we obtain the following equation @xmath31 in terms of the net charge @xmath32 the last equation can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 . in this equation the dragging frequency outside the star is modified by the electrical energy due the presence of a net electric charge in the star .",
    "equation ( 12 ) can not be solved exactly , however for @xmath36 it is possible to obtain a physically interesting solution to ( 12 ) , such as for the case of a charged compact star . under this approximation equation",
    "( 12 ) becomes  @xmath37 where we define @xmath38 .",
    "we notice that equation ( 13 ) has a regular singular point at @xmath11 whereas equation ( 12 ) has a removable singularity at @xmath39 also .",
    "solution to equation ( 13 ) can be obtained by standard integration procedure , which gives @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42are constants of integration .",
    "equation ( 14 ) is only an approximate solution of the original equation ( 12 ) . however",
    "a comparison between numerical solutions to equation ( 12 ) and solution ( 14 ) shows that solution matches correctly to the exact solution for @xmath43 .",
    "a drawback of the solution ( 14 ) seems to be its non - reducibility to the case of an uncharged electrically neutral object , that is the limit when @xmath44 . to investigate this",
    "more fully we expand the exponentials in ( 14 ) in a power series , after some simplification we have @xmath45 separating terms independent of @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 here the first two term gives the correct solution to equation ( 14 ) for the chargeless case .",
    "for the remaining terms in equation ( 16 ) it can be seen that as @xmath46 approaches zero , the terms in parentheses  together become vanishingly small for a fixed value of @xmath11 .    in the figure ( 1 )",
    "we give exact numerical solutions of equation ( 12 ) for different values of @xmath46 .",
    "for comparison with the approximate formula ( 14 ) for modified lense - thirring frequency , plots are given in figure ( 2 ) , between the dragging frequency @xmath10 and the radial distance @xmath11 .",
    "in both cases we take @xmath48 and @xmath49 in gravitational units @xmath50 .",
    "figure ( 3 ) consists of plots for the spherically symmetric part of the metric @xmath26 as a function of distance @xmath11 for various values of net charge @xmath46 inside the star .",
    "we notice that the modified lense - thirring frequency has the same profile in each case for different values of charge @xmath46 .",
    "we have studied the spacetime around a rotating electrically charged massive object within the context of the general theory of relativity .",
    "the spacetime metric is determined using the coupled set of einstein - maxwell field equations for the case of a rotating electrically charged system .",
    "these equations are then solved to obtain analytical expressions for the metric components .",
    "the solutions obtained show that the presence of charge effects the spacetime in a twofold way .",
    "firstly , it modifies the total energy density hence the total mass of the system .",
    "this in turn effects the spherically symmetric part of the spacetime metric ( figure 3 ) .",
    "secondly , the axially symmetric part of the metric due to the rotation of the system modifies the lense - thirring spacetime dragging around the gravitating object(figure 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we obtain an analytical formula for the modified lense - thirring dragging frequency which is applicable to the case of charged compact objects under the approximation @xmath36 .",
    "we find that charged massive object ( such as a charged compact star ) is not only more strongly gravitating due to the enhanced total mass ( energy density ) , but if rotating the dragging of spacetime around the massive object is modified also .",
    "this effect has important implications for electrically charged gravitationally bound stellar systems .",
    "for instance a free falling inertial observer ( zamo ) with velocity four vector @xmath51 circling the star at fixed radial distance will not only need larger potential energy to keep itself in orbit , but also will revolve faster due to the enhanced dragging frequency .",
    "estimated charge contained in an electrically compact star can be as high as @xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to the mass increase of about ten to twenty percent mass of the star in a neutral condition@xmath52 .",
    "observationally the detection of such effects , for instance around a charged electric star ( electar ) , seems therefore quite feasible ."
