    "a non - self - conjugate particle with a non - zero spin can have a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) if the combined transformation of charge conjugation ( c ) and parity ( p ) is not an exact symmetry . in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions , cp violation is generated by the kobayashi - maskawa ( km )",
    "the electron edm generated from the km mechanism is about @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the expected muon edm in the sm is about @xmath12 .",
    "these values are more than 13 orders of magnitude below the current experimental limits .",
    "therefore , precise measurements of the electron and the muon edms might reveal new sources of cp violation beyond the sm .",
    "several experiments have been carried out to search for a neutron edm ( @xmath13 ) and an electron edm ( @xmath14 ) . at present , the experimental upper limits on @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite at 95% c.l .",
    "are @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",

    "a significant electric dipole moment for the electron or the neutron can be generated if cp violation is mediated by higgs - boson exchange . in a non - supersymmetric model with multi - higgs doublets , for flavor symmetry to be conserved naturally to a good degree , a discrete symmetry is usually required . in a two higgs doublet model",
    ", there will be no cp violation from the higgs sector if the discrete symmetry enforcing natural flavor conservation is exact . if this symmetry is broken only by soft terms , cp violation can be introduced and the flavor changing interaction can be kept at an acceptably low level as well @xcite .",
    "the edm of an elementary fermion , generated from higgs - boson exchange , has dominant contributions from one - loop or two - loop diagrams . intuitively , the one - loop contributions are proportional to the product of two yukawa couplings @xmath19 ; while the leading two - loop contributions are proportional to only one yukawa coupling @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fermion mass and @xmath22 gev is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs field .",
    "the exact one loop result actually goes like @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson .",
    "the two - loop contributions dominate for the electron edm because its one - loop contributions are greatly suppressed . for the muon edm",
    ", the one - loop contributions could be comparable to those from two - loop diagrams for large @xmath25 .",
    "several studies have confirmed that a significant electron edm can be generated if higgs - boson exchange mediates cp violation in a two higgs doublet model with yukawa interactions of model ii @xcite . in this model ,",

    "diagrams with the charged higgs boson ( @xmath26 ) can also contribute to the electron edm .",
    "however , recent measurements on the decay rate of @xmath27 by the cleo collaboration @xcite constrain the mass of the @xmath26 in the model ii to be at least three times larger than the @xmath3 boson mass @xcite , and contributions from the @xmath26 are therefore not expected to be significant . for the muon edm",
    ", the two loop contributions involving the @xmath2 quark as well as the @xmath3 boson were found to be dominant and to satisfy a simple scaling relation @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion did not take into account potentially important two loop contributions involving the @xmath5-quark and the @xmath6-lepton .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the first complete calculation for the muon edm in a two higgs doublet model with cp violation generated from higgs - boson exchange and yukawa couplings of model ii .",
