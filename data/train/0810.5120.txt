    "vz  cephei ( also known as bd  + 70  1199 and gsc  04470 - 01334 ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 , j2000.0 ; @xmath11 ) was discovered photographically as a variable star by @xcite , who classified it to be of type `` is ? '' , a rapid irregular variable .",
    "@xcite made the first spectral type assignment as g0 .",
    "its discovery as an eclipsing binary is due to @xcite , who determined a period of 1.18336 days and showed it to have unequal minima .",
    "the system was included by @xcite in his photometric surveys of eclipsing binary stars .",
    "because of its relatively late spectral class , @xcite had it as a target in his program to search for late - type ( f  k ) eclipsing binary stars .",
    "he concluded on the basis of 4 spectrograms that both stellar components were likely hotter than g0 .",
    "no determinations have been made of the physical properties of the stars , and the system has generally been neglected except for measurements of the times of eclipse made by a number of investigators since 1994 .",
    "we began our investigation for the same reason popper did : to test theoretical predictions of the properties of low - mass stars .",
    "we and other authors have previously found that in some of these binary systems the absolute properties are not well described by standard stellar evolution theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find below that vz  cep also shows some anomalies compared to standard models , even though its components are both more massive than the sun .",
    "photometric times of minimum light of vz  cep available from the literature are collected in table  [ tab : minima ] .",
    "eclipse ephemerides determined by weighted least squares separately from the 15 primary minima and the 13 secondary minima gave the same period within the errors .",
    "a joint fit of all the measurements was then performed enforcing a common period but allowing the primary and secondary epochs to be free parameters .",
    "scale factors for the internal errors were determined by iterations separately for the two types of measurements in order to achieve reduced @xmath12 values near unity .",
    "this solution resulted in a phase difference between the two epochs of @xmath13 , not significantly different from 0.5 . for our final ephemeris",
    "we imposed a circular orbit , and obtained @xmath14 the uncertainties of the fitted quantities in terms of the least significant digit are shown in parentheses .",
    "the final scale factors for the published internal errors were similar to those in the previous fit , and were 1.38 for the primary and 2.42 for the secondary .",
    "we adopt this ephemeris for the spectroscopic and photometric analyses below .",
    "vz  cep was placed on the observing list at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) in 2003 january , and was observed until 2007 june with an echelle spectrograph on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( mount hopkins , az ) . a single echelle order 45  wide centered at 5188.5",
    "was recorded with an intensified reticon photon - counting diode array , at a resolving power of @xmath15 .",
    "the strongest lines in this window are those of the  @xmath16 triplet .",
    "a total of 39 spectra were obtained with signal - to - noise ratios ranging from 19 to 47 per resolution element of 8.5  kms@xmath17 .",
    "radial velocities were measured with the two - dimensional cross - correlation technique todcor @xcite .",
    "templates for the primary and secondary were selected from a large library of synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.kurucz ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculated spectra cover a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath18 ) , rotational broadenings ( @xmath19 when seen in projection ) , surface gravities ( @xmath20 ) , and metallicities .",
    "solar metallicity was assumed throughout , along with initial values of @xmath21 for both components .",
    "the temperatures and rotational velocities for the templates were determined by running extensive grids of two - dimensional cross - correlations and seeking the best correlation value averaged over all exposures , as described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the secondary component in vz  cep is some 5 times fainter than the primary , and we were unable to determine its temperature independently .",
    "we therefore adopted the results from other estimates described below , and chose the nearest value in our library , which is 5750  k. due to the narrow wavelength range of our spectra the derived temperatures are strongly correlated with the assumed surface gravities .",
    "the secondary @xmath20 presented in  [ sec : dimensions ] is very close to the value we assumed , but the primary @xmath20 is intermediate between 4.0 and 4.5 , so we repeated the calculations above using the lower value , and interpolated .",
    "the results for the primary are @xmath22  k and @xmath23  kms@xmath17 , and for the secondary we obtain @xmath24  kms@xmath17 .",
    "radial velocities were derived with template parameters near these values .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of the cfa velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "possible systematics in the radial velocities that may result from residual line blending in our narrow spectral window , or from shifts of the spectral lines in and out of this window as a function of orbital phase , were investigated by performing numerical simulations as described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , we generated artificial composite spectra by adding together copies of the two templates with scale factors in accordance with the light ratio reported below , and with doppler shifts for each star appropriate for each actual time of observation , computed from a preliminary orbital solution .",
    "these simulated spectra were then processed with todcor in the same manner as the real spectra , and the input and output velocities were compared .",
    "experience has shown that the magnitude of these effects is difficult to predict , and must be studied on a case - by - case basis .",
    "corrections were determined for vz  cep based on these simulations and were applied to the raw velocities .",
    "the corrections for the primary star are small ( under 1  kms@xmath17 ) , but for the secondary they are as large as 11  kms@xmath17 , and as expected they vary systematically with orbital phase or radial velocity ( see figure  [ fig : rvcorr ] ) .",
    "similarly large corrections have been found occasionally for other systems using the same instrumentation ( e.g. , ad  boo , gx  gem ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the impact of these corrections is quite significant for vz  cep : the minimum masses increase by 4% for the primary and 1.9% for the secondary , and the mass ratio decreases by 2.1% .",
    "the final velocities in the heliocentric frame , including the corrections for systematics , are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] and have typical uncertainties of 1.3  kms@xmath17  for the primary and 3.8  kms@xmath17  for the fainter secondary .",
    "-0.5 in -0.25 in -0.7 in    preliminary single - lined orbital solutions using the primary and secondary velocities separately indicated a zero - point difference between the two data sets ( i.e. , a difference in the systemic velocity @xmath25 ) , which is often seen by many investigators in cases where there is a slight mismatch between the templates used for the cross - correlations and the spectra of the real stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerous tests with other templates did not remove the offset .",
    "this most likely arises in our case because of stellar parameters ( particularly the rotation ) that fall in between the template parameters available in our library of synthetic spectra , which come in rather coarse steps of 10  kms@xmath17  at the high rotation rates of vz  cep .",
    "we therefore included this velocity offset as an additional free parameter in the double - lined orbital fit , and we verified that when doing so the velocity semi - amplitudes ( which determine the masses ) are insensitive to the exact template parameters within reasonable limits , and are essentially identical to those resulting from separate single - lined solutions .",
    "our final orbital fit is presented in table  [ tab : specorbit ] .",
    "no indication of eccentricity was found , as expected for such a short period , so only a circular orbit was considered in the following .",
    "a graphical representation of the observations and our best fit , along with the residuals , is shown in figure  [ fig : rvorbit ] .",
    "-0.1 in -0.2 in -0.1 in    the light ratio between the primary and secondary was determined from our spectra following @xcite , accounting for the difference in line blocking between the primary and the much cooler secondary .",
    "after corrections for systematics analogous to those described above , we obtained @xmath26 at the mean wavelength of our observations . a further adjustment to the visual band taking into account the temperature difference between vz",
    "cep a and b was determined from synthetic spectra integrated over the @xmath0 passband and the spectral window of our observations , and resulted in @xmath27 .",
    "differential photometry of vz  cep was obtained at the ursa observatory on the university of arkansas campus at fayetteville , ar .",
    "the ursa observatory sits atop kimpel hall and consists of a meade f/6.3 , 10-inch schmidt - cassegrain telescope with a santa barbara instruments group st8en ccd camera inside a technical innovations robodome , all controlled by a macintosh g4 computer in an adjacent control room inside the building .",
    "the field of view is 20@xmath28 .",
    "images of vz  cep ( @xmath29 ) and the two comparison stars gsc  04470 - 01497 ( @xmath30 ) and gsc  04470 - 01622 ( @xmath31 ) , both of which are within 6  of the target , were taken with typical integration times of 60 seconds through a bessell @xmath0 filter . with an overhead of about 30 seconds to download the images from the camera ,",
    "the observing cadence was typically 90 seconds per image .",
    "a `` virtual measuring engine '' application written by lacy was used to determine the brightness of the variable and comparison stars , to subtract off the sky brightness , and to correct for differences in airmass .",
    "a total of 5473 images were gathered between 2001 march 5 and 2003",
    "september 7 .",
    "differential magnitudes were formed between the variable star and the magnitude corresponding to the sum of the fluxes of the two comparison stars . these are listed in table  [ tab : photometry ] , and shown graphically in figure  [ fig : photometry ] along with our modeling described below .",
    "expanded views of the primary and secondary eclipse are given in figure  [ fig : photometry1 ] and figure  [ fig : photometry2 ] .",
    "the typical precision of these measurements is about 0.007 mag , which is comparable to that expected from photon statistics ( @xmath80.006  mag ) .",
    "the comparison stars are not known to be variable .",
    "the mean magnitude difference between the two was constant with a standard deviation of 0.0095  mag over 67 nights , which is what would be expected for individual magnitudes with a typical error of 0.007  mag .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis of the individual differences was performed to search for periodic signals in either star , but none were detected .",
    "-0.6 in -0.1 in -0.75 in    -0.6 in -0.1 in -0.75 in    -0.6 in -0.1 in -0.75 in    we have previously found @xcite that the ursa photometry is significantly improved by removal of small nightly zero - point variations .",
    "thus 67 nightly corrections were made to the original magnitudes based on a preliminary photometric orbital fit .",
    "this procedure reduced the residual standard deviation by about 15% , a small but significant amount .",
    "examination of these offsets , which are typically smaller than 0.01  mag , revealed no detectable pattern as a function of orbital phase .",
    "such a pattern might be expected , for instance , if there were perturbations in the light curve due to spots on either star ( assuming synchronous rotation ) .",
    "we thus consider the nightly offsets to be instrumental in nature .",
    "the corrected photometry was fitted with the nde model @xcite , with all observations being assigned equal weight . in this model",
    "the stars are represented as biaxial ellipsoids , and despite the relatively large radius of the primary of vz  cep relative to the separation ( see below ) , its ellipticity of 0.016 , as defined by @xcite , is still well below the maximum tolerance of 0.04 @xcite , and thus the model is expected to be adequate for this case .",
    "we return to this below .",
    "we used the jktebop implementation of @xcite with a linear limb - darkening law , consistent with our findings @xcite that with the amount and precision of our data , non - linear limb - darkening laws do not improve the accuracy of the fits significantly .",
    "the following quantities were allowed to vary in this unconstrained solution : the central surface brightness @xmath32 of the secondary ( cooler ) star relative to the primary , the sum of relative radii @xmath33 , the ratio of radii @xmath34 , the orbital inclination @xmath35 , the limb - darkening coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 , a phase offset , and the magnitude at quadrature .",
    "the following quantities were kept fixed : the orbital eccentricity @xmath38 , the mass ratio from the spectroscopic solution @xmath39 , and the gravity brightening exponents @xmath40 and @xmath41 , set by the temperatures and surface gravities following @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the adjustable parameters were estimated with a monte carlo technique in which we generated 500 synthetic light curves , solved for the parameters , and calculated the standard error of each parameter .",
    "this process yielded uncertainty estimates accurate to two significant digits , which is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "these `` unconstrained '' results are given in table  [ tab : ebopfits ] .",
    "tests allowing for non - zero eccentricity and third light gave statistically insignificant values for those quantities .",
    "-0.05 in -0.15 in 0.2 in    the @xmath0-band light ratio @xmath42 from this fit is consistent with our spectroscopic value from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] , but formally less precise . in similar systems with partial",
    "eclipses , the _ accuracy _ of the parameters ( more than their precision ) is sometimes compromised because of strong correlations among variables and the relatively flat bottom of the @xmath12 surface in the least - squares problem ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such systems it is often the case that more accurate results are obtained by applying the spectroscopic light ratio as an external constraint .",
    "we have done this here by first computing a grid of solutions for a range of fixed values of @xmath43 .",
    "we then interpolated in the smooth relation obtained between the light ratio and @xmath43 to our value of @xmath44 , and derived @xmath45 .",
    "interpolations of all other quantities to this value of @xmath43 were then carried out .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : constraint ] for some of the key light - curve parameters .",
    "note that @xmath46 , the rms residual of the fit , changes very little for @xmath43 between 0.65 and 0.75 , demonstrating that the radius ratio can not be determined accurately from photometry alone without an external constraint .",
    "the results for the light curve parameters from this constrained fit are listed in table  [ tab : ebopfits ] , and are adopted for further use .",
    "the uncertainties have been propagated directly from the error in the spectroscopic light ratio ( see figure  [ fig : constraint ] ) , and include also a contribution from the statistical uncertainties derived from a separate solution in which @xmath43 was fixed at the best - fit value and all other parameters were left free .",
    "the fitted linear limb - darkening coefficients from this constrained solution tend to be somewhat smaller than predicted by theory .",
    "we find , for example , marginal differences of 0.10 ( @xmath81.3@xmath46 ) for both stars compared to the calculations by @xcite , and more significant differences of 0.19 ( 2.5@xmath46 ) compared to the coefficients by @xcite .",
    "these differences are similar in magnitude ( and in this particular case , of the same sign ) as those reported , e.g. , by @xcite , and may be due to shortcomings in the theoretical model atmospheres although observational errors can not be ruled out . for further comparisons between theory and observations",
    "the reader is referred to the recent work of @xcite .",
    "adopting coefficients from the tables by @xcite leads to values of the relative radii that are larger by 1.1% for the primary and 1.7% for the secondary ( 1.6@xmath46 and 0.5@xmath46 , respectively ) .    as a test of the reliability of the geometric parameters",
    ", we carried out solutions with two other light - curve modeling programs that are more sophisticated than the one we have used .",
    "one is the wink program @xcite , which adopts a better approximation to the stellar shapes as triaxial ellipsoids , rather than the simpler biaxial ellipsoids in ebop , and includes a more detailed treatment of reflection effects .",
    "the version we used has been modified and extended as described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the other program is the wilson - devinney code ( wd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in its most recent ( 2007 ) release , which uses roche geometry .",
    "light curve solutions with these two codes were performed for a fixed value of @xmath47 ( as closely as allowed by the different input quantities ) to permit a direct comparison with our constrained jktebop fit , and with the same limb - darkening law and coefficients as used earlier .",
    "the wink fit delivered marginally smaller relative radii that differ from our jktebop results by @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( i.e. , less than 0.4% ) , and an inclination angle that was only @xmath50 larger .",
    "the wd fit gave @xmath51 , @xmath49 , and @xmath52 .",
    "these results are thus not significantly different from those of the simpler model we have used , as expected from the relatively small ellipticity of the stars mentioned earlier .    the individual temperatures were determined from the central surface brightness parameter @xmath32 slightly adjusted for limb darkening to correspond to the disk average ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absolute visual flux scale of @xcite , and an estimate of the mean system temperature used as the initial value for the primary .",
    "the latter was then improved by iteration until convergence .",
    "the mean system temperature is based on accurate strmgren photometry for vz  cep reported by @xcite .",
    "interstellar reddening was estimated using the calibration of @xcite and the method of @xcite , which resulted in @xmath53 and an intrinsic color index of @xmath54 .",
    "the calibration by @xcite was then used to derive a mean system temperature of @xmath55  k , assuming solar metallicity .",
    "the individual temperatures derived in this way are @xmath56  k and @xmath57  k for the primary and secondary , respectively , which correspond to spectral types of approximately f3 and g4 @xcite .",
    "the primary @xmath18 is identical to our spectroscopic estimate in ",
    "[ sec : spectroscopy ] .",
    "the temperature difference based the light curve is of course better determined than the absolute values : @xmath58  k. use of a different color / temperature calibration for inferring the mean system temperature , such as that by @xcite , yields results only @xmath830  k hotter .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric solutions above lead to the masses and radii given in table  [ tab : absolute ] .",
    "also included are the predicted projected rotational velocities , calculated under the assumption of synchronism with the orbital motion .",
    "the secondary value is consistent with our measured @xmath19 from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] , but the expected value of @xmath59  kms@xmath17  for the primary seems somewhat larger than our spectroscopic estimate of @xmath23  kms@xmath17 . at face value",
    "this would indicate sub - synchronous rotation of that component , which is unexpected in a short - period binary such as vz  cep . since the primary star dominates the light of the system , we investigated the possibility that there might be a photometric signal produced , for instance , by rotational modulation from surface features on that component .",
    "for this we examined the residuals from our adopted light curve solution .",
    "a lomb - scargle power spectrum did not indicate any significant periodicities within a factor of two of the orbital frequency , although the primary star is likely to be too hot for spots to be important ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "there are no measurements of the chemical abundance of vz  cep .",
    "our own spectroscopy is inadequate for this , and the combined - light strmgren indices along with the calibration by @xcite indicate [ fe / h ] @xmath60 , in which the uncertainties include photometric errors as well as the scatter of the calibration .",

    "as measured here we find the distance to the system to be @xmath61  pc ( similar distances are obtained separately for each component , indicating the consistency of the measured properties ) .",
    "discrepancies described in the next section between our effective temperature estimates and the @xmath18 values predicted by stellar evolution models prompted us to attempt a deconvolution of the combined - light photometry of vz  cep , as a check on both the color excess and the temperature difference between the components .",
    "we used tables of standard strmgren indices by @xcite and @xcite , and synthesized binary stars for a range of primary indices and a fixed @xmath0-band light ratio given by our spectroscopic estimate of @xmath27 .",
    "we explored a wide range of @xmath62 values . at each reddening we determined the intrinsic indices for the primary and secondary that provide the best match to the system values of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 as measured by @xcite , in the @xmath12 sense .",
    "we found the best agreement for @xmath67 , in excellent accord with our earlier determination based on the combined light .",
    "the measured @xmath63 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 indices are reproduced to well within their uncertainties , and @xmath64 is within 1.8@xmath46 .",
    "making use of the same color / temperature calibration by @xcite invoked earlier , the intrinsic indices for each star from this photometric deconvolution yield temperatures of 6670  k and 5690  k , once again in very good agreement with the light curve results .",

    "the absolute masses of vz  cep have formal relative errors of 1% or better .",
    "the radius of the primary is similarly well determined , while that of the faint secondary is good to about 3.7% .",

    ". however , these stars are all in very different evolutionary states so that their radii span a range of 33% and their effective temperatures differ by up to 360  k. they are therefore of little help in understanding the discrepancies with theory noted above for vz  cep .",
    "only one other well measured binary has one component with a mass similar to that of the secondary of vz  cep , but that star ( ek  cep  b ) is considered to be in the pre - main sequence stage @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : radteff ] highlights the main disagreement between the models and the measurements for vz  cep , which is that the temperature difference predicted from theory for the measured masses and surface gravities is much smaller than all of our estimates .",
    "solar metallicity models , which appear to fit the properties of the primary well , indicate @xmath76  k , and this is reduced further to 660  k when considering the higher metallicity of @xmath73 .",
    "the uncertainty in these determinations is difficult to quantify , but a useful measure may be obtained by propagating the uncertainty in the measured masses , which results in @xmath7750  k. uncertainties from physical inputs to the models are unlikely to add much to this due to the differential nature of the comparison . in this paper",
    "we have made three empirical determinations of @xmath78 , as follows : 1 ) @xmath79  k , based on the @xmath32 value from our light - curve analysis along with the visual flux scale of @xcite and our spectroscopic brightness ratio ( used as an external constraint ) ; 2 ) @xmath80  k , from photometric deconvolution based on the measured strmgren indices and the spectroscopic brightness ratio (  [ sec : dimensions ] ) , along with the color / temperature calibrations of @xcite ; 3 ) @xmath81  k , directly from a primary temperature estimate based on spectroscopy (  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ) and an assumed temperature for the secondary similar to estimates for that star from the other two methods .",
    "while these three determinations are not completely independent , their consistency despite the widely different ingredients reinforces our conclusion that the model @xmath82 is at least @xmath8250  k too small .",

    "the study of v1061  cyg by @xcite suggested that the problem is not confined to m dwarfs , but extends up to masses almost as large as that of the sun ( 0.93  m@xmath2 in the case of v1061  cyg  b ) . at the same time , the radii of these stars appear too large compared to theory , and both discrepancies are generally attributed to the effects of stellar activity in these short - period , tidally synchronized and rapidly rotating systems .",
    "there is little doubt that the vz  cep system is active , judging by its strong x - ray emission as recorded by rosat @xcite .",
    "we estimate its x - ray luminosity to be @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is in cgs units ) , and @xmath85 .",

    "the mass of vz  cep  b is slightly larger than that of the sun , but it still has a thin convective envelope representing about 1.3% of the total mass , which suggests that star may in fact be responsible for most of the x - ray emission given that the primary has no convective envelope .",
    "another indication is given by the rossby numbers of the stars ( ratio @xmath89 between the convective turnover time and the rotational period ) .",
    "for the primary we estimate @xmath90 , which according to ( * ? ?",
    "* fig .  6 ) clearly places it among the inactive stars .",
    "the secondary , on the other hand , has @xmath91 .",
    "stars in this regime tend to be very active and have photometric variability due to spots with amplitudes as large as @xmath80.4 mag .",
    "detection of this expected variability is difficult in vz  cep because of the faintness of the secondary .",
    "nevertheless , we examined the nightly residuals from our adopted solution near the primary minimum , where the contrast is more favorable , and we see only occasional systematic deviations on one or two nights .",
    "however , similar deviations are seen at the secondary eclipse , and also outside of eclipse , which leads us to believe these are residual instrumental errors rather than real changes in the light level caused by spottedness on the secondary ( see  [ sec : photometry ] ) .",
    "if we consider the properties of the primary of vz  cep to be relatively well described by theory for a metallicity near solar , then the secondary shows a temperature difference compared to models in the same direction as mentioned above for other active stars ( i.e. , lower than predicted ) .",
    "however , we see no indication that its radius is larger than predicted ( figure  [ fig : massrad ] ) , which we would have expected not only from the evidence displayed by other systems but also from recent theoretical studies of the effects of chromospheric activity ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "as described in previous sections , we have carried out a variety of tests to explore the possibility of systematic errors in our mass , radius , or temperature determinations , including a careful examination of biases in our velocity measurements , and sanity checks of our light - curve analysis with results from more sophisticated modeling programs .",
    "we were unable to demonstrate any significant errors that would explain the discrepancies in the preceding paragraph .",
    "for example , matching the model @xmath78 with the @xmath82 measured from the light curve would require a change in the mass ratio to @xmath92 , much lower than allowed by the spectroscopy , regardless of the choice of cross - correlation templates ( see  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "conversely , deriving a smaller temperature difference from the light curve to match the models would require an increase in @xmath32 to values that are unrealistic and would bring strong disagreement with the light ratio from spectroscopy .",
    "additionally , this would leave the other two empirical estimates of @xmath78 unchanged , and a discrepancy would remain .",
    "as indicated earlier , we see no evidence for third light at a level that would make much difference .",
    "the adjustments required in each of the quantities mentioned above , and others we experimented with , are so large compared to the uncertainties that a combination of effects is unlikely to resolve the issue either .    at the suggestion of the referee ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : baraffe ] a comparison with an alternate set of models by @xcite , which allows us to explore the effect of differences in the mixing length parameter @xmath93 .",
    "previous studies of the radius and temperature discrepancies for active low - mass stars have indicated that a value of @xmath93 lower than appropriate for the sun , representing a reduced overall convective efficiency , provides a much better match to the observations of these objects .",
    "consequently , we show a solar - metallicity evolutionary track for a solar - like mixing length parameter for the radiative primary ( @xmath94 in these models ) , and tracks for three values of the mixing length parameter for the secondary star ( @xmath94 , 1.5 , and 1.0 ) , which , as mentioned earlier , we believe to be the more active member of the system . for reference , triangles on each track mark the age of 1.4  gyr , which we found in figure  [ fig : radteff ] to provide the best match for @xmath95 using the yonsei - yale models . the @xcite model for the primary",
    "is seen to be similar to the corresponding solar - metallicity yonsei - yale model ( dashed line , reproduced from figure  [ fig : radteff ] ) . a reduction of the mixing length parameter for the secondary star leads to the expected systematic decrease in effective temperature , and an increase in radius .",
    "a secondary model with @xmath93 between 1.0 and 1.5 , when paired with the standard @xmath94 model for the primary , would appear to give approximately the correct temperature difference for the system .",
    "however , the measured radius of vz  cep  b is somewhat smaller than predicted , in agreement with our earlier conclusion that this star appears normal in size ( compared to standard models ) .",
    "the 13% difference between our measured @xmath19 for the primary and the predicted synchronous velocity is somewhat puzzling , and is significant at the 2.5-@xmath46 confidence level .",
    "we do not believe errors in the spectroscopic measurements are to blame since all 39 of our individual spectra consistently give values smaller than predicted .",
    "a reduction in the predicted value could be accomplished with an increase in @xmath43 , but it would have to be much larger than allowed by our photometric solutions , and would once again bring disagreement between the photometric and spectroscopic light ratios .    at the moment we are unable to offer an explanation for the differences noted above , and based on the tests just described we are inclined to believe that the measurements are accurate and that the system is affected in some way that the models do not account for , most likely having to do with chromospheric activity .",
    "it would also appear that our understanding of the effects of chromospheric activity ( reduced convective efficiency , spot coverage ) on the global properties of stars is still incomplete , since we see here only the effect on the temperature predicted by recent models that account for these phenomena @xcite , but not the effect on the radius .",
    "vz  cep thus presents a challenge to theory .",
    "further progress in understanding these differences may be made by obtaining complete light curves in multiple passbands , which would give a better handle on the temperature issue .",
    "higher signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopy would also help in refining the @xmath19 measurements for the primary and secondary , in constraining the abundance , and perhaps also in providing a more direct determination of the effective temperatures and revealing whether emission is present .",
