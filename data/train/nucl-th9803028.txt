    "in a recent study of the @xmath0 reaction at energies close to threshold , it is found that the angular distributions of the outgoing particles are isotropic , in agreement with the assumption that the reaction proceeds as a @xmath5 transition@xcite .",
    "several model calculations@xcite of s - wave pion production , which are based on a single nucleon and a pion rescattering mechanism , under estimate the cross section by a factor of 3 - 5 .",
    "inspired by a study of @xmath6-decay in nuclei , which indicates that the axial charge of the nuclear system is enhanced by heavy meson exchanges and , by using a simple operator form of the nn potential , lee and riska@xcite have shown that meson exchange currents could explain the scale of the cross section .",
    "adding to the single nucleon and rescattering terms a z - graph describing various heavy meson exchanges , horowitz et al.@xcite performed similar calculations based on explicit one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model for the nn interaction as well as for the evaluation of meson exchange contributions .",
    "the contribution from the rescattering term depends on the off - shell behavior of the @xmath7 scattering amplitude .",
    "there are several approaches based on field theoretical models which allow such extension to be made but the results are model dependent . in the traditional phenomenological treatment@xcite , the off mass - shell and on mass - shell amplitudes are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "recently , several groups@xcite have shown that the off mass - shell @xmath8n rescattering amplitude is enhanced strongly with respect to the on mass - shell amplitude .",
    "hernandez and oset@xcite by applying current algebra and pcac constraints argue that this enhancement may bring the calculated cross section for the @xmath0 reaction into agreement with experiment .",
    "however based on detailed momentum - space calculations , hanhart et al.@xcite conclude that the enhancement of the rescattering amplitude due to offshellness falls a bit too short to explain the scale of the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "park et al.@xcite , cohen et al.@xcite and sato et al.@xcite have applied a chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath9pt ) , including chiral order 0 and 1 lagrangian terms .",
    "they have shown that the off mass - shell @xmath8n elastic scattering amplitude is enhanced considerably but has an opposite sign with respect to the on mass - shell amplitude .",
    "because of this difference in sign , the rescattering term and the born term contributing to the @xmath0 reaction interfere destructively , making the theoretical cross sections much smaller than experimental values and thus suggesting a significant role for heavy meson exchanges in @xmath3 production .    in the present work we report on a covariant obe model calculations based on the mechanism depicted in fig .",

    "the half off mass - shell amplitudes for the conversion processes , hereafter denoted by @xmath15 , are taken as the sum of three terms corresponding to the s , u and t - channels displayed in fig .",
    "one important aspect of this mechanism is that at the @xmath3 production threshold , the transferred 4-momentum is space - like , @xmath16 .",
    "this is very much the same kinematic as occurring in @xmath3 electroproduction through vector meson exchanges , and we apply a formalism similar to the one applied for electroproduction amplitudes@xcite calculations .",
    "the formalism to be applied is consistent with the obe picture of the nuclear force and accounts for relativistic effects , crossing symmetry , energy dependence and nonlocality of the hadronic interactions .",

    "their model was based on correlated @xmath18 exchange and constrained by using quasiempirical information about the @xmath19 amplitudes .",
    "hanhart et al.@xcite used the t - matrix obtained in this model to calculate the rescattering term for @xmath0 .",

    "the lesson to be learned here is that many small terms added up coherently can explain a seemingly large discrepancy , at a time when other small terms which counteract to balance their effects are disregarded . under these circumstances it seems essential to preserve crossing symmetry at all stages of the calculations and treat all contributions on an equal basis .",

    "we have used the scattering length @xmath193 fm and an effective range @xmath194 fm of ref.@xcite .",
    "the s11 and s13 @xmath8n scattering lengths are taken to be @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively@xcite .    to compare the results from the two approximations we draw in fig .",
    "9 the partial cross sections corresponding to production via a @xmath2 meson t pole mechanism . for neutral pion production ,",
    "the cross sections calculated using the two approximations are practically identical .",
    "we note though that approximation i does not account for final meson - nucleon interactions . to see how influential the @xmath8n fsi can be ,",
    "we draw in fig .",
    "10 the cross section corrected for fsi interactions assuming pure i=@xmath197 and i=@xmath198 interactions for the outgoing @xmath3n pairs .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section differ significantly for the two channels .",
    "but , when the @xmath8n interactions are taken in the proper isospin combination , their overall contribution to the fsi factor almost cancels out , leading to an energy dependence practically identical with the one obtained with charged pp fsi ( small dash curve ) only .",
    "we want to stress here that this is an accidental consequence of the fact that the @xmath3p interaction over the allowed i=1/2 and i=3/2 isospin channels averages to zero , making contributions from diagrams with @xmath3p interactions ineffective . this may not be the case for charged pions and @xmath10 meson production@xcite .",
    "we have calculated s - wave pion production in @xmath0 using a covariant obe model , where a boson b created on one of the incoming protons is converted into a neutral pion on the second . the amplitude for the conversion process @xmath199 are taken to be the sum of s and u pole terms and when allowed a meson pole term in a t - channel . to be consistent with the obe picture of the nn interaction we have considered contributions from all of the @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "both the scale and energy dependence of the cross section are reproduced rather well .",
    "based on a covariant quantum field theory , the transition operator must be fully covariant and as such it includes contributions from irreducible connected diagrams only , each involving large momentum transfer . the operator @xmath173 , eqn .",
    "48 , and likewise the calculated amplitude preserve crossing symmetry and relativistic covariance throughout the calculations .",
    "furthermore , terms which involve three meson vertices are written in a general form .",
    "as an example , the lagrangian corresponding to a @xmath26 vertex , in addition to non derivative terms , includes derivative @xmath200 and @xmath201 interaction terms .",
    "the off - shell properties of the various partial production amplitudes are taken into account explicitly . for vector and scalar mesons ,",
    "offshellness is contained in the nucleon form factor and has a marginal influence .",
    "a pseudovector coupling for the pseudoscalar particles , as assumed in this work , introduces an extra factor of @xmath32 to the amplitude .",
    "consequently for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 , each of the s and u nucleon pole terms at @xmath202 becomes a factor of @xmath203 higher in comparison with its value on mass shell . to account for the off mass shell behavior of the @xmath2-meson pole term",
    ", we have used adler s consistency conditions and the isospin even @xmath3p scattering length to write the @xmath26 vertex in a rather general form . taking all of the s , u and t - channel contributions into account",
    ", we have found that the @xmath204 conversion amplitude off the mass shell is more than a factor @xmath205 higher in comparison with its on mass shell value .",
    "consequently , the @xmath8 exchange contribution to the amplitude for the @xmath0 reaction dominates the production process and brings the calculated cross section to agree with data .",
    "we have found that the contribution from a @xmath2-meson pole in a t - channel dominates pion production at threshold . a term as such accounts effectively for two - pion exchange contributions .",
    "the @xmath26 vertex used to calculate this contribution depends rather strongly on the @xmath8n @xmath2-term .",
    "however , even if we use a value , @xmath206 , which is unrealistically too low , a t - channel @xmath2 pole term amounts to more than a factor of two higher a contribution than that of the s and u - channel nucleon poles .",
    "it seems quite impossible to disregard such an important contribution to the production process .",
    "neither the overall contribution from all meson exchanges , nor any of the various meson exchange contributions , from s and u nucleon pole terms only , can reproduce data for this process .",
    "in fact , various contributions of a similar size are found to interfere destructively and including all of these in a consistent manner , yields a production amplitude far below what would be required to explain data .",
    "this conclusions seems unavoidable and independent on the approximation used to account for isi and fsi corrections .",
    "a meson production in nn collisions necessarily involves large momentum transfer .",
    "thus , two - pion exchanges which describe short range interactions are expected to play an important role . in a traditional covariant obe model such contributions are represented by an effective scalar @xmath2-meson pole term . in @xmath9pt calculations these should result from expanding the existing calculations to include one loop two - pion diagrams .",
    "recently , we have extended the existing @xmath9pt calculations@xcite taking into account all tree and loop diagrams up to chiral order d=2 .",
    "with these one loop contributions added , it is found that in analogy with a dominant @xmath2 meson pole term , there are substantial contributions from isoscalar - scalar two - pion t - channel exchanges@xcite .",
    "in summary , two - pion exchanges play an important role in the production of @xmath3 in @xmath207 . by taking these into account",
    ", we have demonstrated that a covariant obe model can explain the existing near threshold neutral pion production data .",
