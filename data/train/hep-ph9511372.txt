    "in the collision of two heavy ions one can generate for a very short time an atomic system with an effective charge which is the sum of the charges of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this is possible because electrons with a wavelength of 1/@xmath0 fm can not resolve structures far below this scale . for the short time",
    "such a collision takes an electron becomes very strongly bound .",
    "its binding energy can actually exceed twice its rest mass .",
    "this happens if the combined atomic charge is larger than roughly 173 , depending on the amount of shielding by the other electrons .",
    "fig.1 gives an impression of the relevant atomic processes in such an ` overcritical ' heavy ion collisons .",
    "these processes have been extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally . with the exception of @xmath1-electron production in u+pd collisions at 6.1 mev / u the theoretical and experimental results",
    "have been found to agree perfectly within their uncertainties , which are typically 10 - 20 percent . + the technical treatment of strong field problems is basically always the same .",
    "because the coulomb - potential is so strong it can not be treated as perturbation but has to be included into the fundamental hamiltonian .",
    "for the special case of two colliding heavy ions this reads @xmath2 with @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the nuclear charge density and the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for projectile and target .",
    "it is also practical to include the dominant part of the electron - eclectron interaction , which describes shielding of the ion charges , in the potential .",
    "thus @xmath7 can , e.g. , be chosen as @xmath8 implying a slater approximation for the exchange term . in writing down this hamiltonian",
    "we have made the monopole approximation , i.e. higher multipoles of the coulomb - field are neglected .",
    "one can go beyond this approximation , but it was found that the contributions from higher multipoles are negligable .",
    "@xmath9 is used to calculate the time - independent eigenstates of the two - ion system .",
    "time dependence enters through the varying distance vector between the two ions @xmath10 .",
    "the time - dependent dirac - equation can be converted to a system of coupled differential equations by expanding the wave functions according to @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 these equations have to be solved for a given trajectory @xmath10 .",
    "the square of the expansion amplitudes @xmath14 taken at large @xmath6 leads to the occupation probability for the state @xmath15 . in this way many experiments were described with high accuracy . figure 2 and 3 are typical examples and one could show dozens of similar plots .",
    "however , the most interesting process in figure 1 , namely the process c which is called ` spontaneous pair production ' could not be observed so far and theoretical calculations show that to observe it would require the two ions to stick together much longer than usual .",
    "it is generally agreed that for the rather broad class of nuclear reactions summed over in the experiments so far , such long sticking times can not be expected . + in spite of this fact positron experiments at gsi found pronounced positron lines @xcite and even extremely sharp electron - positron coincidence lines @xcite .    at the time of their discovery it was tempting to interpret these lines as signal for the decay of a new particle , possibly the axion .",
    "new experiments and further theoretical investigations of many low - energy phenomena showed , however , conclusively that this is no valid possibility ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "we summarized these results already early on as folllows : ` ... we have to conclude that we did not find any scenario that would allow to describe the production of an x particle with the required properties without very unnatural assumptions . '",
    "( 1986 , @xcite ) and ` ... therefore , it is tempting to conjecture that some of the experiments are unreliable . '",
    "( 1988 , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the present situation of these lines is the following : recent epos @xcite and orange @xcite experiments at gsi could not reproduce the line observed early although the detectors were improved to give much better statistics ( especially for epos ) . a completely independent experiment at argonne national laboratory called apex",
    "did not find any indication for lines @xcite . at the same time it became clear that nuclear pair - conversion was less well understood than assumed , such that at least some of the data from recent years might be due to conversion , a possibility which is still excluded for the early much larger line structure .",
    "it is unclear , how this has to be interpreted , but definitely there is presently no compelling evidence for any process more exotic than nuclear pair conversion .",
    "a very interesting possibility opened by high - z atoms is to test qed in a non - perturbative regime .",
    "qed is a divergent field theory , and the three basic divergences : vacuum polarization , self energy , and vertex correction have to be renormalized .",
    "this renormalization procedure in a coulomb - potential differs from that in free space , which results in finite corrections to basically all physical quantities .",
    "the complete understanding of these corrections is indispensible for a reliable description of processes taking place in external fields . in frankfurt",
    "we have a long tradition in calculating these @xcite and presently a number of projects are under work .",
    "let me just make a few comments on one of them , which is related to our work on channeling .",
    "+ _ delbrck scattering _ ,",
    "i.e. the scattering of a photon off the coulomb - field of an atom ( see figure 6 )    was carefully measured already some time ago @xcite .",
    "systematic deviations from the lowest - order theoretical prediction were found for high - z atoms , indicating that for these the higher order terms , proportional to @xmath16 , are important .",
    "a direct perturbative calculation of the next order graph is extremely involved and anyway one would like to calculate this graph exactly in all orders of @xmath17 .",
    "this is in fact possible if the perturbative propagator is substituted by the exact propagator for the dirac - operator including the coulomb - field @xmath18 we decomposed the propagator again into contributions of definite angular momentum and inserted these into the calculation of the vacuum polarization graph .",
    "the resulting calculation is very demanding , involving thousends of angular momentum states , and requiring many numerical and analytic tricks to ensure convergence .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "some results are given in the table for photons with the energy @xmath19 for the scattering angle @xmath20       obviously one finds corrections with respect to the lowest - order result for sufficently large @xmath21 .",
    "these investigations are still continued to get complete systematic results for all photon energies and scattering angles . + in another investigation we treated _ channeling _ by solving the dirac equation , starting from first principles .",
    "again this calculation was extremely involved .",
    "however , it constitutes the first completely relativistic calculation for this problem .",
    "if the physics of channeling were qualitatively similar to that of strong fields this should show up in specific relativistic effects .",
    "in fact we got rather satisfactory results ( see figure 7 and 8 , and @xcite ) , but we found    no specifically relativistic effects .",
    "it is usually argued that the relevant mass is very large @xmath22 , such that one can perform quasi - classical calculations .",
    "our results confirm this and show at the same time that for such effectively very heavy particles no phenomena occur which would be similar to overcritical binding in heavy atoms . as a by - product of this calculation we obtained the distribution of the radial distance from the channeling axes at which photons are emitted ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "again details can be found in our publication @xcite .",
    "+    a similar conclusion was also reached by the following investigation .",
    "we studied again the delbrck graph from figure 6 , but this time for the axially symmetric field of a channeling axis .",
    "the calculation was much simplified by the fact that this problem is two - dimensional rather than three - dimensional .",
    "the physical motivation was that a photon couples also to the channeling fields due to virtual production of electron - positron pairs , and this interaction could lead to a channeling of photons with a very small angle relative to the channeling axis , see @xcite .",
    "one result is shown in figure 10 , where the average rotation angle around the    channeling axis during the passage of a photon through the central part of the channeling potential is shown as a function of the angle of incidence @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 would imply complete channeling , i.e. the photon would be bound to the channel .",
    "obviously we are very far from this point , even for very small angles .",
    "for details see @xcite .",
    "again , no substantial increase of the effect with increasing photon energy was observed .",
    "such an increase would have indicated a prolonged existence of the virtual electron - positron pair and thus a stronger interaction with the channeling potential ) was observed .",
    "+ cutting a long discussion short , we would like to argue that the channeling effect is basically different from the effects in over - critical coulomb - fields for the following reason : the fundamental process underlying all effects is the separation of an electron - positron pair in a strongly space - dependent potential . the energy gained by this charge separation is a measure for the size of the novel effets up to the point where it allows the electron and positron to become real , which would be spontaneous pair production . in the channeling situation",
    "the electric fields becomes , however , only strong due to a lorentz boost ( into the rest system of , e.g. , the electron ) .",
    "the same boost introduces also an magnetic field which confines the electron and positron to a radial distance of the size of a landau orbit @xmath25 .",
    "thus the crucial quantity ( electric field strength ) @xmath26 ( radial separation of electron and positron ) is proportional to @xmath27 , which is basically independent of the electron velocity , i.e. the lorentz factor @xmath28 .",
    "thus no typical overcritical field effects can be expected .",
