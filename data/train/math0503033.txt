    "in @xcite , etnyre and honda explored the methods of convex surface theory in contact geometry as a tool for the classification of legendrian and transverse knots ( up to legendrian or transverse isotopy , respectively ) .",
    "their main result was that legendrian resp .",
    "transverse torus knots in @xmath3 with the standard tight contact structure @xmath4 are classified by their topological knot type and the so - called classical invariants : thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath5 and rotation number @xmath6 in the legendrian case , self - linking number in the transverse case .",
    "regarding the former case , the only previous work in that direction had been the corresponding result for unknots ( in any tight contact @xmath7manifold ) , due to eliashberg and fraser  @xcite . in the transverse case ,",
    "there are also results due to eliashberg , etnyre , birman - wrinkle and menasco ; see  @xcite for references .    the aim of the present note is to apply the methods of etnyre and honda to the study of certain legendrian and transverse links , where we obtain analogous positive results .",
    "the first knot type whose legendrian realisations , by contrast , are not determined by the classical invariants was found by chekanov  @xcite ; this and further examples of links with that property are described in @xcite and  @xcite .    in order to avoid undue repetition , we assume that the reader is familiar with the contact geometric concepts discussed in section  2 of  @xcite",
    ". we shall also have to appeal to a number of results from convex surface theory as discussed in section  3 of that paper , and many of our reasonings are parallel to those employed by etnyre and honda , so we advise the reader to have a copy of their paper at hand ( and better also a copy of honda s fundamental paper  @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , we have tried to give additional details whenever this seemed to clarify the exposition . for a brief introduction to convex surface theory one may also consult  @xcite ; for a survey on knots in contact geometry see  @xcite .",
    "our first result concerns the ( oriented ) link @xmath8 in @xmath0 , with @xmath9 a trivial knot and @xmath10 a cable of @xmath9 , that is , a torus knot on the boundary @xmath11 of a tubular neighbourhood @xmath12 of  @xmath9 .",

    "homologically ( on @xmath11 ) , @xmath10 is equivalent to @xmath20 with @xmath21 coprime integers .",

    "our choice of notation is more convenient for arguing in analogy with  @xcite .",
    "the only crucial point , anyway , is the distinction between positive and negative torus knots , determined by the relative sign of @xmath26 and  @xmath27 . )",
    "we now consider legendrian realisations of such links .",

    " implicitly , but completely  the range of the classical invariants realised by cable links . this amounts to a complete classification of such links .",
    "by methods analogous to the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] , we can also prove a result about legendrian torus knots in the @xmath1jet space @xmath29 of the circle with its standard contact structure  @xmath30 .",

    "thus , by the theorem of eliashberg and fraser  @xcite , the contactomorphism type of @xmath44 does not depend on the specific choice of  @xmath37 .    given a legendrian knot @xmath42 in @xmath2 homotopic to @xmath45 times a generator of the fundamental group @xmath46",

    "there we also justify the above formulae for the classical invariants . our proof is based on the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] ; this again allows one to determine the range of the classical invariants .",

    "we compute @xmath467 which is homotopic through nonvanishing sections of @xmath84 to the vector field  @xmath468 .",
    "this proves that @xmath469 .",
    "the same considerations as for the standard contact structure on @xmath243 ( defined likewise by @xmath470 , now with @xmath471 ) apply to show that in the front projection to the @xmath454plane we have @xmath472 with @xmath473 the number of cusps oriented upwards or downwards , respectively .",
