    "interference alignment was first considered in @xcite as a coding technique for the two - user mimo x channel , where it was shown to achieve multiplexing gains strictly higher than that of the embedded mimo interference channel , multiple - access channel , and broadcast channel taken separately . while requiring perfect channel knowledge , this coding technique is based only on linear precoding at the transmitters and interference suppression filtering at the receivers .",
    "this transmission technique was later generalized to the @xmath0-user interference channel @xcite , where it was shown to achieve almost surely a sum - rate multiplexing gain of @xmath1 per time and frequency dimension . in comparison , independent operation of @xmath0",

    "section [ section_success_prob ] derives expressions for the outage probability , while section [ section_simres ] presents simulation results and performance comparisons .",
    "let us introduce the model for the clustered wireless ad hoc network .",
    "the clustering of nodes may be due to geographical factors , hot spots with a high user density or induced by the channel access scheme .",

    "[ fig : sample_cluster_process ] . a neyman - scott process results from homogeneous independent clustering applied to a stationary poisson process @xcite .",
    "the cluster process consists of a parent poisson process of density @xmath4 .",
    "the parent points themselves ( depicted by crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_cluster_process ] ) are not included but serve as reference points for the daughter points that are scattered independently and with identical distribution around the position of the parent points . the scattering density function @xmath5 is chosen as @xmath6 with the vector @xmath7 containing the two dimensional coordinates relative to the parent point .",
    "hence , each point is scattered using a circularly symmetric normal distribution with variance @xmath8 . since the scattering density of the representative cluster is isotropic",
    ", the whole cluster process @xmath2 is isotropic . here",
    ", we assume that the number of points @xmath9 in a representative cluster @xmath10 is fixed .",
    "the clusters form a partition of @xmath2 .",
    "the overall intensity of the cluster process is therefore the product of the parent process intensity and the number of nodes per cluster @xmath11 .    , a fixed number of cluster points @xmath12 and scattering parameter @xmath13 .",
    "parent points are depicted by crosses and daughter points by circles , width=264 ]    we can write the point process as a random set @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the coordinate of the point in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "let us denote the set of indices of the points @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a subset of @xmath18 containing the indices of @xmath10 .",
    "each transmitter @xmath19 is assumed to transmit at unit power .",
    "the receivers , depicted by squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_cluster_process ] , are not considered a part of the process .",
    "that is , the model excludes the partner selection problem and focuses on the notion of a common distance that information travels in the network @xcite .",
    "every transmitter and receiver is equipped with @xmath20 and @xmath21 antennas , respectively .",
    "the transmitters inside of a cluster @xmath10 use a spatial interference alignment ( ia ) scheme @xcite in order to suppress the interference that they cause to each other , i.e. the members of the same cluster @xmath10 cooperate and adjust the spatial structure of their transmitted signals in order to avoid interfering with each other .",
    "the rest of the network @xmath22 contributes non - aligned interference . while not optimal in general , treating the inter - cluster interference as noise is , in fact , optimal in the gaussian weak interference regime @xcite . in particular , this case arises when the cluster density @xmath4 is small .",

    "the discrete - time signal received at a given time instant is the superposition of the signals transmitted by the @xmath9 transmitters of the considered cluster @xmath10 , and the transmitters of the rest of the network @xmath22 , weighted by their respective channel gains and path - loss coefficients .",
    "namely , the signal at receiver @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the scalar signal transmitted by node @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the associated precoding vector which will be further specified in subsection [ subsection_feasible ] .",

    "@xmath34 is a noise term , accounting for the thermal noise generated in the radio frequency front - end of the receiver and interference from sources other than the considered transmitters @xmath35 .",
    "our aim is to suppress the intra - cluster interference inside of each cluster @xmath10 individually , by means of spatial ia .",
    "more specifically , we use ia with multiplexing gain one for each of the @xmath9 transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "this strategy is suboptimal in general , but chosen for analytical tractability .",

    "the receiver uses a projection vector @xmath38 on the subspace orthogonal to the intra - cluster interference in order to suppress unintended signals from transmitters @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining dimension of the received signal space is used for interference free communication with the intended transmitter .",
    "therefore , for every cluster @xmath10 , ia is achieved in the spatial domain with degree of freedom one iff there exists @xmath40 unit - norm vectors ( precoding vectors ) @xmath37 and @xmath41 unit - norm vectors ( interference suppression vectors )",
    "@xmath42 such that , for all @xmath36 , @xmath43 under the assumption that the channel coefficients @xmath44 are drawn independently and identically from a continuous distribution , it appears from @xcite , @xcite that the existence ( with probability one ) of an ia solution depends solely on the dimensions of the problem ( @xmath45 , and not on the particular channel realization . in the particular case of multiplexing gain one , solutions exist for the @xmath9-user interference channel iff @xmath46 the iterative algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* algorithm 1 ) or for symmetric mimo systems the closed - form solution in @xcite can be used to find the precoding and interference suppression vectors .",
    "let us now analyze the input - output relation of the system after interference suppression inside the clusters .",
    "projecting the receive signal @xmath47 ( [ intfchannel ] ) onto the orthogonal subspace of the interference , using @xmath42 , suppresses all intra - cluster interference .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath50 , @xmath51 is a scalar coefficient with the same variance as the components in @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , the effective noise term @xmath53 , is a scalar gaussian coefficient with the same variance @xmath54 as the noise vector @xmath34 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , an equivalent scalar input - output relation of the system after interference suppression yields @xmath56 which can be interpreted as a system with single antenna terminals where the intra - cluster interference has been completely suppressed , as pictured in fig .",

    "* appendix ii ) it is shown that the success probability ( when we neglect the noise @xmath64 ) is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 and independent of the mean @xmath63 .",
    "we denote the two dimensional integral in ( [ equ_pr_succ_fixed ] ) by @xmath67 .",
    "the integral over @xmath68 in @xmath69 originates from the campbell - mecke theorem applied to the homogeneous poisson parent process .",

    "since we found an upper bound on @xmath75 , we lower bound @xmath67 in ( [ equ_pr_succ_fixed ] ) with ( [ equ_jensons ] ) as @xmath88 shifting the integrand in ( [ equ_int_lb ] ) towards direction @xmath89 and change of variables leads to an equivalent expression for the lower bound on @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath90 where the first equality comes from a change of the cartesian coordinates @xmath91 into polar coordinates , i.e. @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
