    "the final state of a high energy hadronic collision is inherently extremely complicated .",
    "hundreds or even thousands of particles will be recorded by detectors at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , making the task of reconstructing the original ( simpler ) hard event very difficult .",
    "this large number of particles is the product of a number of branchings and decays which follow the initial production of a handful of partons .",
    "usually only a limited number of stages of this production process can be meaningfully described in quantitative terms , for instance by perturbation theory in qcd .",
    "this is why , in order to compare theory and data , the latter must first be _ simplified _ down to the level described by the theory .",
    "jet clustering algorithms offer precisely this possibility of creating calculable observables from many final - state particles .",
    "this is done by clustering them into jets via a well specified algorithm , which usually contains one or more parameters , the most important of them being a `` radius '' @xmath0 which controls the extension of the jet in the rapidity - azimuth plane .",
    "one can also choose a recombination scheme , which controls how partons ( or jets ) four - momenta are combined .",
    "the choice of a _ jet algorithm _",
    ", its _ parameters _ and the _ recombination scheme _ is called a _ jet definition _ @xcite , and must be specified in full ( together with the initial particles sample ) in order for the process @xmath1 to be fully reproducible and the final jets to be the same .",
    "while ( almost ) any jet definition can produce sensible observables , not all of them will produce one which is _ calculable _ in perturbation theory .",
    "for this to be true , the jet algorithm must be _ infrared and collinear safe _ ( irc safe ) @xcite , meaning that actions producing configurations that lead to divergences in perturbation theory , namely the emission of a very soft particle or a collinear splitting of a particle into two ) must not produce any change in the jets returned by the algorithm .",
    "the importance for jet algorithms to be irc safe had been recognized as early as 1990 in the ` snowmass accord ' @xcite , together with the need for them to be easily applicable both on the theoretical and the experimental side .",
    "however , many of the implementations of jet clustering algorithms used in the following decade and a half failed to provide these characteristics : cone - type algorithms were typically infrared or collinear unsafe beyond the two or three particle level ( see @xcite for a review ) , whereas recombination - type algorithms were usually considered too slow to be usable at the experimental level in hadronic collisions .",
    "this deadlock was finally broken by two papers , one in in 2005 @xcite , which made sequential recombination type clustering algorithms like @xmath2 @xcite and cambridge / aachen @xcite fast , and one in 2007 , which introduced siscone @xcite , a cone - type algorithm which is infrared and collinear safe . a third paper introduced , in 2008 , the anti-@xmath2 algorithm @xcite , a fast , irc safe recombination - type algorithm which however behaves , for many practical purposes , like a nearly - perfect cone .",
    "this set of algorithms ( see table  [ table : safe - algs ] ) , all available through the fastjet package @xcite , allows one to replace most of the unsafe algorithms still in use with fast and irc safe ones , while retaining their main characteristics ( for instance , the midpoint and the atlas cone could be replaced by siscone , and the cms cone could be replaced by anti-@xmath2 ) .",

    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : areas ] .",
    "jet areas are amenable , to some extent , to analytic treatments @xcite , or can be measured numerically with the tools provided by fastjet .",
    "these analyses disprove the common assumption that all cone - type algorithms have areas equal to @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , depending on exactly which type of cone algorithm one considers , its areas can differ , even substantially so , from this naive estimate : for instance , the area of a siscone jet made of a single hard particle immersed in a background of many soft particles is @xmath6 ( this little catchment area can explain why other iterative cone algorithms with a split - merge step , like the midpoint algorithm in use at cdf , have often been seen to fare ` well ' in noisy environments ) .",
    "one can analyse next the @xmath2 and the cambridge / aachen algorithms , and see that their single - hard - particle areas turn out to be roughly @xmath7 .",
    "finally , this area for the anti-@xmath2 algorithm is instead exactly @xmath5 .",
    "this fact , together with its regular contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : areas ] , explains why it is usually considered to behave like a ` perfect cone ' .",
    "jet areas also allow one to use some jet algorithms as tools to measure the level of a sufficiently uniform background which accompanies harder events .",
    "this can be accomplished by following the procedure outlined in @xcite : for each event , all particles are clustered into jets using either the @xmath2 or the cambridge / aachen algorithms , and the transverse momentum @xmath8 and the area @xmath9 of each jet are calculated .",
    "one observes that a few hard jets have large values of transverse momentum divided by area , whereas most of the other , softer jets have smaller ( and similar ) values of this ratio . the background level @xmath10 , transverse momentum per unit area in the rapidity - azimuth plane , is then obtained as @xmath11 the range @xmath12 should be the largest possible region of the rapidity - azimuth plane over which the background is expected to be constant .",
    "the operation of taking the median of the @xmath13 distribution is , to some extent , arbitrary .",
    "it has been found to give sensible results , provided that the range @xmath12 contains sufficiently many soft background jets  at least about ten ( twenty ) of them , if only one ( two ) harder jets are also present in @xmath12 , are usually enough @xcite .",
    "to a certain extent , and within certain limits , the background to a hard collision created by the soft particles of the underlying event ( eu ) can be considered fairly uniform .",
    "it becomes then amenable to be studied with the technique introduced in the previous section .",
    "this constitutes an alternative to the usual and widespread approach ( see for instance @xcite ) of triggering on a leading jet , and selecting the two regions in the azimuth space which are transverse to its direction and to that of the recoil jet .",
    "these two regions are considered to be little affected by hard radiation ( in the least energetic of them it is expected to be suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath14 ) , and therefore one can expect to be able to measure the ue level there .     determination of the background level @xmath10 of a toy - model random underlying event , as a function of the radius parameter @xmath0 .",
    "each point is the result of averaging over many different realizations .",
    "the parameters have been adjusted to roughly reproduce the situation expected at the lhc.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    this way of selecting the ue can be considered a _",
    "topological _ one : particles ( or jets ) are classified as belonging to the ue or not as a result of their position . on the other hand , the median procedure described in the previous section",
    "can be thought of as a _ dynamical selection _ :",
    "no a priori hypotheses are made and , in a way that changes from one event to another , a jet is automatically classified as belonging to the hard event or to the background as a result of its characteristics ( namely the value of the @xmath15 ratio ) .",
    "one can further show that this selection pushes the possible contamination from perturbative radiation to very large powers of @xmath14 : for a range @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 , perturbative contamination will only start at order @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , suggesting that the perturbative contribution is minimal .",
    "a sensible criticism of this procedure is that the ue distribution is not necessarily uniform , and may for instance vary as a function of rapidity .",
    "a way around this is then to choose smaller ranges , located at different rapidity values , and repeat the @xmath10 determination in each of them . of course care",
    "will have to be taken that the chosen ranges remain large enough to satisfy the criterion on the number of soft jets versus hard ones given in the previous section : for instance , a range one unit of rapidity large can be expected to contain roughly @xmath22 soft jets for @xmath21 , which makes it marginally apt to the task list before taking the median @xcite . ] .",
    "a final word should be spent on which values of the radius parameter @xmath0 can be considered appropriate for this analysis . roughly speaking , @xmath0 should be large enough for the number of ` real ' jets ( i.e. containing real particles ) to be at last larger than the number of ` empty jets ' ( regions of the rapidity - azimuth plane void of particles , and not occupied by any ` real ' jet ) .",
    "it should also be small enough to avoid having too many jets containing too many hard particles .",
    "analytical estimates @xcite and empirical evidence show that for ue estimation in typical lhc conditions one can expect values of the order of 0.5  0.6 to be appropriate .",
    "much smaller values will return @xmath23 , while larger values will tend to return progressively larger values of @xmath10 , as a result of the increasing contamination from the hard jets .",
    "[ fig : ue ] shows results obtained with a toy model where 100 soft particles with @xmath24 gev are generated in a @xmath25 region .",
    "ten hard particles , with @xmath26 gev , can be additionally generated in the same region .",
    "one observes how , after a threshold value for @xmath0 , @xmath10 is estimated correctly for the soft - only case , while when hard particles are present they increasingly contaminate the estimate of the background .",

    "[ fig : pu - ue ] shows the determination of @xmath10 in a simulated dijet event at the lhc , with and without pileup . in both cases the general structure of the toy - model in fig .",
    "[ fig : ue ] can be seen , though it is worth noting that in the ue case ( left plot ) the slope can vary significantly from event to event , and also according to the monte carlo tune used @xcite . the larger particle density ( and probably higher uniformity ) of the pileup case allows for an easier and more stable determination .",
    "distributions of @xmath10 from the ue over many simulated lhc dijet events ( @xmath27 gev , @xmath28 ) , using different monte carlos and different ue tunes .",
    "preliminary results.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    once a procedure for determining @xmath10 is available , one can think of many different applications .",
    "one possibility is of course to tune monte carlo models to real data by comparing rho distributions , correlations , etc .",
    "a preliminary example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : css ] , where studying the distribution of @xmath10 can be seen to allow one to discriminate between ue models which would otherwise give similar values for the average contribution @xmath29 .",
    "more extensive studies are in progress @xcite .",
    "yet another use of measured @xmath10 values is the _ subtraction _ of the background from the transverse momentum of hard jets .",
    "@xcite proposed to correct the four - momentum @xmath30 of the jet @xmath31 by an amount proportional to @xmath10 and to the area of the jet itself ( the susceptibility of the jet to contamination ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a four - dimensional generalization of the concept of jet area , normalized in such a way that its transverse component coincides , for small jets , with the scalar area @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "one can show @xcite that such subtraction of the underlying event can improve in a non - negligible way the reconstruction of mass peaks even at very large energy scales .",
    "a similar procedure is also being considered @xcite for heavy ion collisions , where the background can contribute a huge contamination , even larger than the transverse momentum of the hard jet itself ( partly because of this , one usually speaks of ` jet reconstruction ' in this context , rather than just ` subtraction ' ) .",
    "initial versions of this technique have already been employed at the experimental level by the star collaboration at rhic in @xcite , where irc safe jets have been reconstructed for the first time in heavy ion collisions .",
    "since 2005 numerous developments have intervened in jet physics .",
    "a number of fast and infrared and collinear safe algorithms are now available , allowing for great flexibility in analyses .",
    "tools have been developed and practically implemented to calculate jet areas , and these can used to study various types of backgrounds ( underlying event , pileup , heavy ions background ) and also to subtract their contribution to large transverse - momentum jets .",
    "these new algorithms and methods ( as well as the ones not mentioned in this talk , like the many approaches to jet substructure , see e.g. @xcite , useful in a number of new - physics searches ) are transforming jet physics from being just a procedure to obtain calculable observables to providing a full array of precision tools with which to probe efficiently the complex final states of high energy collisions .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers of mpi@lhc08 in perugia for the invitation to this interesting conference , as well as gavin p. salam and sebastian sapeta for collaboration on the ongoing underlying event studies , and gregory soyez and juan rojo for the work done together on related jet issues ."
