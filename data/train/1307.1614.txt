    "heavy fermions form a class of rare - earth based intermetallic compounds that has attracted sustained attention.@xcite recent years have seen intensive effort , both in theory and experiment , to understand the unusual properties exhibited by these materials over a temperature range above a quantum critical point ( qcp).@xcite the most typical cases involve a zero - temperature transition from an antiferromagnetically ordered state to a paramagnetic heavy fermi - liquid .",
    "a particularly notable feature of the quantum - critical regime is the non - fermi liquid behavior , which has been observed in transport , thermodynamic , and other properties in a number of compounds .",

    "a microscopic theory of local quantum criticality@xcite has been formulated in terms of extended dynamical mean - field theory ( edmft),@xcite in which the kondo lattice model is mapped to an effective quantum impurity problem : the bose - fermi kondo model ( bfkm ) with self - consistently determined densities of states for the fermionic conduction band and for the bosonic bath .",

    "for @xmath171 the flows approach a plateau characteristic of the slow variation close to the unstable fixed point and eventually move away to the k fixed point .",
    "for @xmath172 we see the same critical values , which then move towards the lm fixed point .",
    "notice that in this latter regime the states tend to become doubly degenerate and can be fitted to a spin - dependent potential scattering term corresponding to a finite @xmath173term .",

    "one sees that some of these critical flows do not change with @xmath143 . for the rest , it is more difficult to determine if the eigenvalues are indeed changing continuously as in the @xmath110 sector .",

    "although it is difficult at this stage to make strong statements about the nature of these critical excitations we can attest at least to the fact that in the @xmath110 case they appear to change continuously with @xmath143 .",
    "a reasonable scenario is that the extra dissipation provided by increased @xmath143 requires an increased renormalized effective @xmath186 at the critical point .",
    "some evidence for this is also provided since one requires an increasing bare @xmath187 * * with increasing @xmath143 in order to bring the flows closer to the critical surface .",
    "the fact that the spectrum changes provides evidence that we are dealing with a line of unstable fixed points extending from the @xmath177 bfkm * * and having the same set of critical exponents as the former . in the alternate scenario alluded to above , a flow to a different unstable fixed point would produce essentially the same critical eigenvalues for all @xmath188cases . a schematic flow diagram for the transverse - field bfkm * * showing a line of critical fixed points extending from the @xmath177 * * case * * is given in fig .",

    "we close this section by noting that the @xmath190 eigenstates in the k phase do not recover the @xmath191 symmetry characteristic of a simple kondo singlet suggesting that there is a residual splitting due to the transverse field . as shown in fig .",

    "we have carried out numerical renormalization - group studies of the bose - fermi kondo model in the presence of a transverse field @xmath178 for different values of the coupling to a dissipative bosonic bath with a bath exponent @xmath195 .",
    "we found that the system can be tuned across a second - order quantum phase transition between a local - moment phase and a kondo screened phase .",
    "we also found that the transition is characterized by critical exponents identical to those of the @xmath164bfkm for @xmath196 , and exhibits hyperscaling .",
    "a continuously varying critical spectrum suggests that these new fixed points are lying on a line of critical fixed points extending from the known @xmath164bfkm * * critical point .",
    "our results are interesting in their own right .",
    "furthermore , in the ising - anisotropic kondo lattice model , a transverse field introduces quantum fluctuations in the local - moment component . through the extended dynamical mean field theory , a self - consistent bose - fermi kondo model with ising anisotropy and a transverse local field provides the means to study the ising - anisotropic kondo lattice model with a transverse field .",
    "the results reported here will therefore have implications for the kondo - destruction transitions in the lattice model .",
    "in particular , our evidence for the line of unstable fixed points in the bose - fermi kondo model suggests a line of kondo - destruction quantum critical point in the lattice model , as in the proposed global phase diagram .",
