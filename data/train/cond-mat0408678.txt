    "when reducing the size of magnetic particles to the nanoscale , surface and finite - size effects play a dominant role on establishing their peculiar low temperature magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "reduction of the magnetic ordering temperature and spontaneous magnetization as particle size is reduced @xcite , increased coercivities and high closure fields in the hysteresis loops @xcite are often attributed to the frustration associated to broken bonds and disorder present at the particle surface . however , in real samples , these effects are usually masked by the presence of particle size distributions and by the magnetic interactions between the particles ( often mentioned as a possible source of their spin - glass - like behavior ) , making it very difficult to discern what is the real contribution of surface effects alone on the magnetic properties . moreover",
    ", current experimental techniques do not allow to probe surface microscopic structure in geometries such as those of a nanoparticle , a fact that forces to assume phenomenological models for surface anisotropy .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations constitute a benchmark to probe different models since , by modeling magnetic ions as classical @xcite or ising spins @xcite , the interatomic interactions , the local magnetic anisotropy directions and the values of anisotropy constants can be easily varied while taking into account the exact geometry of the underlying lattice of magnetic ions . here",
    ", we will present results of mc simulations aimed to understand the influence of surface anisotropy on the magnetic properties and hysteresis of a single nanoparticle , neglecting the effects of interactions with other particles .",
    "since most of the peculiar low temperature magnetic properties of nanoparticles are more clearly observed in ferromagnetic oxides , we will consider here a particle with lattice geometry of maghemite ( @xmath1-fe@xmath2o@xmath3 ) , a ferrimagnetic compound in which the magnetic ions sit on two sublattices ( @xmath4 ) with different coordination .",
    "we have considered particles with spherical shapes of diameters @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the lattice constant).the @xmath7 magnetic ions will be modeled by heisenberg classical spins @xmath8 of unit magnitude with the following interaction hamiltonian in temperature units @xmath9+\\sum_{i= 1}^{n_{s}}\\left[k_s(\\vec{s}_i \\cdot \\hat n_i)^2 \\right]\\ .    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is an extension to heisenberg spins of our previous model for ising spins in which the first term accounts for the n.n .",
    "exchange interaction , with @xmath10 the ( intra)inter - sublattice ( negative ) exchange constants ( see @xcite for numerical details ) and the second represents the interaction with the external field @xmath11 ( this can be translated to physical units through the relation @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the magnetic moment of fe ions ) .",
    "the last two terms have been introduced to differentiate the magnetic anisotropy at the @xmath14 core spins , @xmath15 ( uniaxial along the z - axis ) , from that at the @xmath16 surface spins ( those in the outer unit cell ) , @xmath0 , which will be considered to point along the local radial direction @xmath17 due to breaking of crystalline symmetry at particle boundaries .",
    "our goal is to understand the change in the magnetic properties as @xmath0 is increased from @xmath18 for different particle diameters @xmath19 .",
    "some of the details of the mc method as implemented in our simulations can be found in previous works @xcite .     to the projection along the local easy - axes @xmath20 as a function of the surface",
    "anisotropy constant @xmath21 .",
    "the inset in ( a ) shows the total magnetization along the z - axis @xmath22 .",
    "below : snapshots of the corresponding @xmath23 configurations of a spherical particle with @xmath24 obtained after cooling from a disordered state at high @xmath25 are displayed for representative values of @xmath0 in the two regimes . ]    in order to characterize the influence of the surface anisotropy on the magnetic order at low temperatures , we have first performed simulations to find the equilibrium configurations at low @xmath25 . for this purpose ,",
    "we start from a disordered configuration of spins at a high temperature ( @xmath26k ) and follow a progressive cooling down to @xmath27 in constant temperature steps @xmath28k in absence of magnetic field . in order to better characterize the magnetic ordering of the states achieved at @xmath27 ,",
    "we have also computed the quantity @xmath29 , which indicates the departure of spins from alignment along the local easy - axis ( @xmath30 in this case ) . in fig .",
    "[ eq_maghemite_phase_fig ] , we present the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the configurations corresponding to @xmath21 ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 for particles with diameters @xmath35 . the curves in this figure , indicate ferrimagnetic order along the z - axis when @xmath36 and @xmath37 and radial alignment of spins when @xmath38 and @xmath39 . as can be clearly seen , at a value @xmath40",
    ", there is a change in the magnetic order of the configurations as marked by the sharp decrease of @xmath41 and @xmath42 to zero and the increase of @xmath43 to 1 .",
    "for @xmath44 the particle has a ferrimagnetic ordered core along the z - axis ( see left upper snapshot in fig .",
    "[ eq_maghemite_phase_fig ] ) with surface spins that progressively deviate towards the radial direction as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this gives rise to the formation of vortex - like structures that extend to the particle core , as can be seen in the right upper snapshot in fig .",
    "[ eq_maghemite_phase_fig ] . for @xmath45 , the net magnetization of the particle tends towards zero .",
    "this is due to the fact that the department of surface spins towards the radial direction is transmitted to the core via the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , giving rise to hedgehog - like structures ( see ower snapshots in fig .",
    "[ eq_maghemite_phase_fig ] ) .     for different values of @xmath0 as indicated .",
    "the different panels stand for ( a ) the total magnetization , ( b ) the contribution of the core to @xmath20 , and ( c ) the contribution of the surface to @xmath20 . ]",
    "we have also simulated the hysteresis loops of particles with diameters @xmath35 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we initially apply a strong enough magnetic field along the z - axis strong that is subsequently varied in steps @xmath46 k during which the magnetization is averaged over 1000 mc steps at each field value . in fig .",
    "[ hist_d5_fig ] , we present hysteresis loops for a particle with @xmath24 for representative values of @xmath0 .",
    "let us first notice that , as surface anisotropy increases , the hysteresis loops change from quasi - squared shape , indicating that the dynamics of the particle may be described as the quasi - uniform rotation of the magnetization due only to the non - compensated spins , to more elongated shape with higher closure fields as observed in oxide particle systems @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the formation of disorder states at the particle surface due to increased anisotropy and frustration due to finite - size effects .",
    "this change in the reversal mechanism can be more clearly analyzed by comparing panels ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ hist_d5_fig ] , where , for values of @xmath45 , we see that surface spins reverse by forming radial structures ( @xmath47 along the loop ) that induce the subsequent reversal of the core @xcite .",
    "further insight into the reversal mechanism can be gained from the dependence of the coercive field @xmath48 and remanent magnetization @xmath49 on @xmath0 presented in fig .",
    "[ hc(ks)_maghemite_fig ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath48 and the decrease in @xmath49 observed in fig .",
    "[ hc(ks)_maghemite_fig ] , are clear indications of a change in the magnetization reversal mechanism from quasi - coherent to a surface dominated process @xcite .",
    "the snapshots of the remanent configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ hc(ks)_maghemite_fig ] demonstrate the formation of a shell with disordered spins pointing towards the radial direction which increases in thickness as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this last feature also explains the obtained dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath49 on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 increases with decreasing size as observed by tronc and coworkers in experiments with maghemite particle dispersions @xcite .     and",
