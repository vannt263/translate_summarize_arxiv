    "selection , random genetic drift and mutations are the processes underlying darwinian evolution . for a long time",
    "population geneticists have analyzed the dynamics in the simplest setting consisting of two genotypes evolving under these processes @xcite . in those studies",
    ", a genotype represents an individual s genetic makeup , completely determining all relevant properties of the individual .",
    "a key concept is the so - called fitness of a genotype which represents the selection pressure for the individuals .",
    "the fitness defines the expected number of offspring an individual will produce . thus , selection acts on fitness differences preferring individuals with higher fitness over individuals with lower fitness .",
    "usually it is assumed that individuals have fixed fitnesses defined by their genotype alone @xcite . yet",
    ", experimental studies have revealed that many natural systems exhibit frequency - dependent selection @xcite , which means that an individual s fitness not only depends on its genotype , but also on its interactions with other individuals and hence on the frequency of the different genotypes in the population .",
    "although such frequency - dependent selection had already been studied early by crow and kimura @xcite , only recently has it received more attention @xcite . in these theoretical and computational studies ,",
    "individuals interactions are represented by interaction matrices from game theory .",
    "this leads to a frequency dependence where the fitness depends directly on the interaction parameters in a linear way .",
    "however , fitness may depend on many diverse factors such as cooperation ( i.e. individuals acting together to increase their fitness @xcite ) and resource competition , so that certain systems may exhibit frequency - dependent fitness that is nonlinear .",
    "for example , in experiments certain hermaphrodites exhibit such nonlinear fitness - dependence @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the impact of such nonlinear dependencies on coevolutionary dynamics has not been investigated theoretically .    in this article",
    "we show that nonlinear frequency dependence @xcite may induce new stable configurations of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we study the impact of asymmetric mutation probabilities on the dynamics @xcite , which was also neglected in most models until now @xcite . as in previous works on coevolutionary dynamics we base our work on the moran process in a non - spatial environment which is a well established model to study evolutionary dynamics and",
    "was already used in many applications @xcite .",
    "the moran process is a stochastic birth - death process which keeps the population size constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a two - genotype model the system becomes effectively one - dimensional , so that the dynamics may be described by a one - dimensional markov chain with transition rates defined by the moran process .",
    "we derive the stationary probability distribution of the system dynamics via its fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "sharp maxima of the distribution reveal metastable points of the dynamics and a multitude of such maxima lead to stochastic switching dynamics between multiple stable points .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model details and in section iii we derive the fokker - planck equation describing the probabilistic dynamics of the population .",
    "using this equation we derive the stationary probability distribution that describes the long - time behavior of the system . in section",
    "iv we analyze this probability distribution , which yields information about the impact of nonlinear frequency - dependent selection and of different mutation probabilities on the coevolutionary dynamics . in section",
    "v we give a summary and discuss our results .",
    "consider a population of @xmath0 individuals evolving in a non - spatial environment , meaning that the population is well - mixed so that each individual interacts with all other individuals at all times . in this population",
    "the individuals may assume one out of two genotypes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the population sizes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) evolve according to the time - continuous moran process described in the following , cf .",
    "the number of individuals @xmath3 of genotype @xmath1 completely determines the state of the system as @xmath6 . at all times",
    "the interactions of the individuals determine the actual ( frequency - dependent ) fitness , so that an individual s fitness of genotype @xmath1 or @xmath2 is defined by a fitness function @xmath7 or @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the fitness functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 may be any functions with the only condition that @xmath9 for all @xmath10 $ ] as negative fitness is not defined . at rate",
    "@xmath11 an individual of type @xmath1 produces an identical offspring which may mutate to genotype @xmath2 with probability @xmath12 .",
    "this applies analogously to genotype @xmath2 .",
    "then one individual of the population is chosen randomly to die , so that the population size @xmath0 stays constant and the variables @xmath13 change maximally by @xmath14 .",
    "this is the so - called moran process which was originally introduced for a population of two genotypes with fixed fitnesses and no mutations occurring , cf .",
    "however , this process is easily generalizable to more genotypes and frequency - dependent selection in the way described above , cf .",
    "@xcite .    note that in our model the rate of reproduction of e.g. type @xmath1 is directly determined by the term @xmath15 as e.g. in @xcite . in other models",
    "the fitness is first normalized so that the rate of reproduction is given by @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 \\label{eq : meanfitness}\\ ] ] is the population s mean fitness . while in both of these models the events",
    "occur with the same probability , the times between the events differ by a common factor determined by the mean fitness ( [ eq : meanfitness ] ) .",
    "thus , these models exhibit a quantitatively different time course , but the same event sequences .    until now ,",
    "usually linear functions have been considered for @xmath18 . however , in many applications nonlinear functions seem more appropriate @xcite .",
    "for example , cooperation effects in game theory induce functions linearly increasing in @xmath3 , so that @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this would mean that fitness increases infinitely with the population size of genotype @xmath1 . yet , in any habitat there is only a limited amount of resources available for living .",
    "therefore , fitness should decline when the population of one genotype becomes too large as all of the individuals will compete for the same resources .",
    "we conclude that a fitness function including these two effects has to contain a nonlinear factor , e.g. @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "here we choose a quadratic nonlinear factor as a simple example . naturally , all other nonlinear functions could be applicable as well .",
    "note that linearly increasing fitness functions such as @xmath19 and @xmath23 lead to quadratic relations for the _ mean _ fitness @xmath24 ( see equation ( [ eq : meanfitness ] ) ) of the population which becomes @xmath25 the quadratic factor originates from the fact that the linear fitness function in ( [ eq : meanfitness ] ) is multiplied by the number of individuals leading to a quadratic dependence on @xmath26 , e.g. @xmath27 .",
    "this factor enters the replicator equation in evolutionary game theory , thus leading to a quadratic fitness dependence in standard game theoretic problems @xcite .",
    "however , this does not imply nonlinear interactions and thus fitness effects such as presented in equation ( [ eq : fitnessfunction ] ) .",
    "therefore , the fitness functions that can be generated by evolutionary game theory are a special case of the functions that occur in the theory presented here",
    ". fitness functions as for example presented in equation ( [ eq : fitnessfunction ] ) will  as we show in this article  lead to dynamics with more complex stability properties . usually , when analyzing the dynamics of such a model system as described above , it was assumed either that no mutations occur at all ( @xmath28 ) @xcite or that the mutation probabilities are equal ( @xmath29 ) @xcite . however , usually mutation probabilities can be highly diverse @xcite .",
    "this has been considered in some examples @xcite , but until now the effect of different mutation probabilities in the introduced model system has not been studied systematically . here",
    ", we explicitly study the effects caused by asymmetric mutation rates ( see e.g. figure [ fig : asymmetricexample ] ) .",
    "in the following we assume the fitness of the individuals to be given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 with the interaction functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the model system is effectively one - dimensional with the variable @xmath34 completely describing the system state @xcite . at each event @xmath35 may change by at most @xmath36 depending only on the actual state of the system , so that the dynamics are markovian .",
    "let the transition @xmath37 occur with the rate @xmath38 .",
    "then this rate is determined by the fitnesses and mutation probabilities in the following way :    * each individual in the population receives offspring with rate @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "this means that genotype @xmath1 receives one offspring with rate @xmath41 .",
    "* such an offspring increases the population @xmath1 with probability @xmath42 , and population @xmath2 in case it mutates with probability @xmath12 . * one individuum is chosen uniformly to die belonging to genotype @xmath2 with probability @xmath43 .",
    "* equivalently the number of individuals of genotype @xmath1 can increase if genotype @xmath2 receives one offspring , which mutates to genotype @xmath1 with probability @xmath44 , and one individuum of @xmath2 is chosen to die .",
    "taken these processes together the transition rate for @xmath37 is@xmath45 decreasing @xmath35 to @xmath46 is equivalent to increasing the number of individuals of genotype @xmath2 , so that the transition rate@xmath47 is obtained analogously .",
    "the master equation of the markov chain is then given by@xmath48 where we define @xmath49 .",
    "as also @xmath50 , the system has reflective boundaries at @xmath51 and @xmath52 . if @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) then @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is an absorbing state of the dynamics",
    "it is possible to derive the exact solution to such an equation similarly to the derivations in @xcite which we do in appendix b. however , the obtained solutions are not very explicit and their implications are hard to grasp .",
    "it is thus more useful to advance to the fokker - planck equation @xcite describing the system in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "as previous works have shown , this approximation already leads to very good results for moderate population sizes of @xmath57 , cf .",
    "we use the transformation @xmath58,\\qquad s=\\frac{t}{n},\\qquad{\\tilde{\\mu}}_{ij}=\\mu_{ij}\\cdot n,\\\\[0.1 cm ] \\rho(x , s)=p_{xn}(sn)n,\\qquad\\tilde{g}_{j}(x)=g_{j}(xn)\\cdot n \\label{eq : rescaledinteraction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yielding the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the scaling factors are derived in appendix a where the derivation of the fokker - planck equation in the scaling limit @xmath59 is shown in detail ( equation ( [ eq : appfpe ] ) ) .",
    "this leads to@xmath60x(1-x)-\\delta{\\tilde{\\mu}}\\right)\\rho(x , s)\\big]+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\big[x(1-x)\\rho(x , s)\\big]\\label{eq : fpe}\\ ] ] with the normalization condition @xmath61 for all @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 are the rescaled interaction functions defined in ( [ eq : rescaledinteraction ] ) , @xmath65 is the rescaled mean mutation rate and @xmath66 is the rescaled mutation rate difference .",
    "these functions have to be rescaled to obtain a non - degenerate limit , the so - called weak selection regime .",
    "notice , that the drift term @xmath67x(1-x)-\\delta{\\tilde{\\mu}}\\ ] ] contains three different effects .",
    "the fitness difference at each point @xmath68 causes a selective drift , the mean mutation rate causes a drift directed to @xmath69 and the mutation rate difference causes a one - directional drift towards one of the boundaries @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the diffusion term@xmath72 reflects the undirected genetic drift .",
    "if fitness differences are on a scale of @xmath73 , then mutation , selection and genetic drift all act on the same scale @xcite . then the dynamics are characterized by an interplay of these different effects . on the other hand , in the strong selection regime  where fitness differences are on a scale @xmath74 ",
    "genetic drift becomes negligible and the dynamics in the bulk of the system become deterministic for large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , as the factor @xmath75 vanishes for @xmath76 and @xmath77 the effects of mutations play an important role . clearly , without mutations @xmath70 and @xmath71 are absorbing states , but even in the strong selection regime they become non - absorbing for any positive mutation rate .",
    "this is reflected in the form of the drift term @xmath78 , as only the factors reflecting mutations @xmath79 remain non - zero in the limits @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    for a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fpe ] ) the stationary distribution is @xcite@xmath80 with the potential@xmath81 which is defined up to a constant irrelevant to our calculations as it is canceled by the normalization@xmath82 thus",

    "this stationary distribution contains contributions from the above mentioned four different effects :    1 .",
    "genetic drift is reflected by @xmath87 which diverges for @xmath88 at the boundaries .",
    "the mean mutation rate @xmath89 causes the balancing term @xmath90 .",
    "3 .   the asymmetry in the mutation probabilities causes the term @xmath91 which diverges at one boundary and vanishes at the other .",
    "all frequency - dependent selection effects are contained in the exponential factor @xmath92dx}$ ] which can take various shapes .",
    "what are the possible shapes for the stationary distribution @xmath93 in the form given by equation ( [ eq : generalsolution ] ) ?",
    "until now , the term @xmath91 representing the asymmetric mutation probabilities has not been considered to our knowledge and the interaction functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the selection term were considered to be at most linear in @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "we should therefore be interested in the effects of nonlinear interaction functions and asymmetric mutation rates .",
    "let us first analyze the dynamics for nonlinear interaction functions @xcite describing the effects of cooperation and limited resources as described by equation ( [ eq : fitnessfunction ] ) , so that@xmath96 already with @xmath97 such interaction functions induce dynamics stochastically switching between three metastable points .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : firstexample ] , where the theoretically calculated stationary distribution from equation ( [ eq : generalsolution ] ) is shown together with data from simulations with a population of @xmath98 individuals which is enough to obtain almost perfect fitting ( cf . also figure [ fig : nplot ] ) .",
    "the fitness functions ( figure [ fig : firstexample]b ) both show at first an increase on increasing the number of individuals of genotype @xmath1 or @xmath2 from @xmath99 due to cooperation effects and then a strong decrease due to resource competion .",
    "as the resulting fitness functions are asymmetric , also the stationary distribution is asymmetric .",
    "there is a maximum at @xmath70 due to genetic drift .",
    "selection drives the dynamics towards a metastable state at @xmath100 , because for @xmath101 genotype @xmath1 is fitter than @xmath2 thus increasing in frequency and for @xmath102 genotype @xmath1 is less fit than @xmath2 thus decreasing in frequency ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : firstexample]b ) .",
    "the maximum of the stationary distribution is thus exactly at the point where @xmath103 . for @xmath104",
    "again genotype @xmath1 is fitter than @xmath2 and thus the dynamics are driven towards @xmath71 by selection as well as genetic drift .",
    "the mutational force induced by @xmath105 increases the height of the maximum at @xmath100 driving the system away from the maxima at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "interestingly , for asymmetric mutation rates ( @xmath111 ) the factor @xmath91 always diverges in the interval @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath113 it diverges for @xmath76 , otherwise for @xmath77 .",
    "this can cause the emergence of a maximum of the stationary distribution at @xmath70 ( or resp .",
    "@xmath71 ) . figure [ fig : asymmetricexample ] shows an example where due to asymmetric mutation rates a maximum occurs at @xmath71 , when for @xmath97 there is an absolute minimum at @xmath71 as this stable state minimizes the population s mean fitness .",
    "this means , that the system dynamics are mutation dominated near @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum located at @xmath70 for @xmath97 is shifted for @xmath113 to values @xmath114 causing a minimum of the stationary distribution at @xmath70 .",

    "for instance figure [ fig : mutplot]b illustrates a shift of an existing stable point , which completely vanishes for high @xmath124 .",
    "we conclude that asymmetric mutation rates can cause the emergence of new stable states ( as in figure [ fig : asymmetricexample ] ) , the disappearance of existing ones ( as in figure [ fig : mutplot ] ) , and shift existing stable states to new positions .    ) for three different symmetric ( @xmath97 ) mutation rates : @xmath121 ( blue , solid ) , @xmath125 ( red , long dashed ) and @xmath126 ( green , short dashed ) .",
    "this illustrates that for low mutation rates the dynamics stay close to the system s edges for long times .",
    "here , differences in the mutation rates only slightly affect the shape of the stationary distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "( b ) shows that for high mutation rates ( @xmath127 ) the dynamics are drawn stronger towards the middle . here",

    "we quantified the quality of the fokker - planck approach for an example ( cf . figure 4 ) where the difference of simulation data and theoretical solution became almost not detectable for population sizes larger than @xmath147 .",
    "actually , if the system exhibits absorbing states then the fokker - planck method does not work to study the corresponding quasi - stationary distributions .",
    "instead , wkb methods are more appropriate to describe the system dynamics as for example in @xcite , where fixation resulting from large fluctuations was studied . in our model system",
    "no such absorbing states exist , as long as the mutation rates are positive ( @xmath172 ) and therefore the fokker - planck equation is appropriate to describe the system dynamics .",
    "we identified the individual effects of selection , mean mutation rate and mutation difference as well as genetic drift and derived the stationary probability distribution as determined by the fokker - planck equation . analyzing the distribution",
    ", we found that asymmetries in the mutation probabilities may not only induce the shifting of existing stable points of the dynamics to new positions , but also lead to the emergence of new stable points .",
    "thus , a genotype that has a selective disadvantage can anyway have a stable dynamical state where its individuals dominate the population due to a higher mutational stability ( see figure [ fig : asymmetricexample ] ) .",
    "further we found , that dynamic fitness leads to multiple stable points of the dynamics induced by selection and also genetic drift .",
    "we showed an example ( figure [ fig : firstexample ] ) where three stable points exist , two caused by selection and one by genetic drift .",
    "we conclude that frequency - dependent fitness together with asymmetric mutation rates induces complex evolutionary dynamics , in particular if the interactions imply nonlinear fitness functions . theoretically , there is no limit for the number of stable points that the dynamics can exhibit ( see figure [ fig : multiplestability ] ) .",
    "all in all , we interprete our results such that in real biological systems multiple metastable equilibria may exist , whenever species interact in a way complex enough to imply a fitness that nonlinearly depends on frequency . as a consequence , one species may exhibit a certain frequency for a long time before a sudden shift occurs and then a new frequency prevails .",
    "such a change may thus occur even in the absence of changes of the environment ; it may be induced as well by a stochastic switching from one metastable state to another due to complex inter - species interactions .",
    "the moran process is a standard tool to gain theoretical insights into experimental data @xcite . of course",
    ", we do not propose here that any experimental setup may be exactly described by the moran process .",
    "however , we think that it should be feasible to develop an experiment where two different mutants evolve with asymmetric mutation rates . to find an experimental setup where the two genotypes also exhibit nonlinear fitness could however prove more difficult .",
    "rather , our study is a theoretical study indicating that nonlinear fitness may be the cause of multible stable states when observed in experimental data .    for further studies on systems with more genotypes it should be useful to combine our considerations presented here with the work of traulsen et al .",
    "@xcite , where an analysis of systems with more than two genotypes was carried out .",
    "extending those results it may be possible to gain a better understanding of the effects of nonlinear interactions for many different genotypes . also , it may be interesting to study the effects of changing interactions , where the interactions change according to the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , our study might serve as a promising starting point to investigate how nonlinear frequency dependencies impact evolutionary dynamics in complex environments .",
