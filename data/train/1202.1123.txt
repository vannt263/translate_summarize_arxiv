    "many studies on the possible magnetic field decay of neutron stars have been done previously , based on the observed statistics of their periods ( @xmath6 ) and period derivatives ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "some of these studies relied on population synthesis that includes complicated observational selection effects , unknown initial parameters of neutron stars , and not completely understood models of radio emission of pulsars@xcite ; consequently no firm conclusion can be drawn on if and how the magnetic fields of neutron stars decays ( see refs.@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "alternatively some other studies used the spin - down or characteristics ages , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the initial spin period of the given neutron star ) , or @xmath10 if @xmath11 , as indicators of the true ages of neutron stars and found evidence for their dipole magnetic field decay@xcite .",
    "however , as we have shown recently , their spin - down ages are normally significantly larger than the ages of the supernova remnants physically associated with them , which in principle should be the unbiased age indicators of these neutron stars@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this age mismatch can be understood if the magnetic fields of these neutron stars decay significantly over their life times , since the magnetic field decay alters the spin - down rate of a neutron star significantly , so that @xmath12@xcite .",
    "pulsars are generally very stable natural clocks with observed steady pulses .",
    "however significant timing irregularies , i.e. , unpredicted times of arrivals of pulses , exist for all pulsars studied so far ( see ref.@xcite for an extensive reviews of many previous studies on timing irregularies of pulsars ) .",
    "the timing irregularies of the first type are  glitches \" , i.e. , sudden increases in spin rate followed by a period of relaxation ; it has been found that the timing irregularies of young pulsars with @xmath13 years are dominated by the recovery from previous glitch events@xcite . in many cases the neutron star recovers to the spin rate prior to the glitch event and",
    "thus the glitch event can be removed from the data satisfactorily without causing significant residuals over model predictions . however in some cases , glitches can cause permanent changes to both @xmath6 and @xmath14 of the neutron star , which can not be removed from the data satisfactorily .",
    "these changes can be modeled as permanent increase of the surface dipole magnetic field of the neutron star ; consequently some of these neutron stars may grow their surface magnetic field strength gradually this way and eventually have surface magnetic field strength comparable to that of magnetars over a life time of 10@xmath15 years@xcite .",
    "these are the first studies that linked the timing irregularies of pulsars with the long term evolution of magnetic fields of neutron stars .",
    "the timing irregularies of the second type have time scales of years to decades and thus are normally referred to as timing noise .",
    "hobbs et al .",
    "carried out so far the most extensive study of the long term timing irregularies of 366 pulsars@xcite .",
    "besides ruling out some timing noise models in terms of observational imperfections , random walks , and planetary companions , some of their main conclusions are : ( 1 ) timing noise is widespread in pulsars and is inversely correlated with @xmath16 ; ( 2 ) significant periodicities are seen in the timing noise of a few pulsars , but quasi - periodic features are widely observed ; ( 3 ) the structures seen in the timing noise vary with data span , i.e. , more quasi - period features are seen for longer data span and the magnitude of @xmath17 for shorter data span is much larger than that caused by magnetic braking of the neutron star ; and ( 4 ) the numbers of negative and positive @xmath18 are almost equal in the sample .",
    "proper understanding of these important observations not only can lead to better understanding of the internal structures of neutron stars , but can also be important for using some millisecond pulsars for gravitational wave detections .",
    "in particular it is of high interests if some of the long term timing noise can be modeled and removed reliably from data , thus improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detections substantially .",
    "it is extremely desirable if a physical model of neutron stars can catch and even predict the main features and long term variations of the timing noise of pulsars , since such a model will ensure that no signal of gravitational waves is removed when modeling the observed timing noise . some of the observed periodicities have been suggested as due to free precessions of neutron stars@xcite .",
    "some strong quasi - periodicities have been identified recently as due to abrupt changes of the magnetospheric regulation of neutron stars , perhaps due to varied particle emissions@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that such varied magnetospheric particle emissions is also responsible for the observed long term timing noise@xcite .",
    "alternatively it has been suggested that the propagation of tkachenko waves in a neutron star may modulate its rotational moment of inertia , and thus produce the observed periodic or quasi - periodic timing noise@xcite . because none of the above processes may permanently change the properties of neutron stars",
    ", we can collectively represent all the above modulations as some sort of oscillations of the observed surface magnetic field strengths of neutron stars , as shown below .    in this work we first model the evolution of the dipole magnetic field of a neutron star as a long term power - law decay modulated by one or several components of oscillations .",
    "we then calculate the spin - down history of a neutron star within the magnetic braking model with the prescribed dipole magnetic field .",
    "the timing noise is then calculated and compared with data .",
    "we show that all main observed features of neutron star s timing noise can be reproduced satisfactorily . in the end",
    "we compare our model with other recently developed models of neutron star s timing noise .",
    "attributing the observed @xmath12 to the long term decay of the magnetic field of a neutron star@xcite , we found that the magnetic field decay should follow a power - law form , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , in good agreement with the field decay process dominated by the ambipolar diffusion mechanism@xcite with constant core temperatures@xcite .",
    "we further found that the core temperatures of magnetars , normal radio pulsars and millisecond pulsars are approximately @xmath21 k , @xmath22 k , and @xmath23 k , respectively@xcite .",
    "the neutron star free precession , inferred from the observed periodic timing noise@xcite , is phenomenologically equivalent to periodic oscillation of its apparent surface magnetic field @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the angle between the magnetic axis and spin axis of the neutron and varies slightly as the neutron star precesses periodically .",
    "similarly the observed strong quasi - periodicities of timing noise can also be phenomenologically modeled as modulations of the observed surface magnetic fields of these neutron stars , which are obtained from the observed @xmath6 and @xmath7 of neutron stars .",
    "we therefore model the evolution of the dipole magnetic field of a neutron star as a long term power - law decay modulated by one or several components of oscillations , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the neutron star age , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the starting time and initial surface dipole magnetic field strength of the neutron star , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the amplitude , phase and period of the oscillating magnetic field of the @xmath33-th component , respectively .    assuming pure magnetic dipole radiation as the braking mechanism for a pulsar s spin down , we have , @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is assumed to be a constant , @xmath37 is its dipole magnetic field at its magnetic pole , @xmath38 is its radius , @xmath39 is its moment of inertia .",
    "we then have , @xmath40 simple calculations show that the value of the first term in the right part of the above equation is much less than the observed @xmath41 as reported in ref.@xcite",

    "is given , @xmath46 for a young pulsar with @xmath47  yr , it is very likely that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ nu_ddot2 ] ) dominates and thus it is generally anticipated that @xmath48 .",

    "( [ nu_ddot2 ] ) gives @xmath54  hz  s@xmath53  s@xmath53 , consistent with observations .",
    "on the other hand , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ nu_ddot2 ] ) dominates for an old pulsar , and thus both positive and negative @xmath41 should be observed with almost equal possibilities .",
    "this is in general agreement with observations@xcite .",
    "in estimating @xmath41 from observations , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath41 are obtained by fitting the phases of all pulses observed to the third order of its taylor expansion over a period of time , @xmath57 we can therefore estimate @xmath41 for a pulsar from @xmath58 where @xmath59 . as shown later , @xmath60 and @xmath32 is on the order of years , therefore @xmath61 for young pulsars .",
