    "intense laser and particle beams interacting with plasma can force plasma electrons to relativistic energies . under the appropriate plasma conditions ,",
    "energy gained by the plasma electrons can be used to create short - lived coherent structures in the plasma .",
    "these structures ( such as linear electron waves and bubble ) have been extensively studied and employed as accelerating and focussing systems for charged - particle beams .",
    "the structures created in the plasma have spatio - temporal scales that are defined by the characteristic of the plasma . the spatial scales by the plasma skin - depth , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "and the temporal scales by the plasma frequency , @xmath3 .",
    "it should be noted that the wakefield theory assumes fixed background ions .",
    "in addition to this , the plasma structures are used only over a few plasma electron periods . however",
    ", when these plasma structures evolve over time , ion - dynamics which occurs over ion - acoustic wave times @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) becomes significant .",
    "for instance , in electron - proton plasma , @xmath6 . if plasma density , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these timescales are important to understand the upper limits of the repetition - rate ( and hence luminosity ) in a future plasma collider @xcite .",
    "also , highly relativistic plasmas are created in astrophysical entities such as active galactic nuclei ( agn such as centaurus - a ( ngc-5128 ) , m-87 ) and lab - based hot plasmas can better explain phenomenon such as the relativistic jets emanating from agns .",
    "these particle jets interact with surrounding gravitationally heated hot plasma and can exhibit phenomenon such as self - focussing , hosing and radiation generation .",
    "the plasma wave is _ coherent _ under the cold - plasma approximation as seen from its dispersion characteristic , @xmath10 which under , @xmath11 is excited over a narrow - band mode centered around @xmath0 .",
    "however , if the plasma is thermally inhomogeneous or the electrons have a large thermal spread the plasma wave mode begins to lose its narrowband characteristic .",
    "when a plasma wave evolves in time , plasma spatial inhomogeneities , driver spatial non - uniformity and ion motion introduce a new set of frequencies into the plasma . with non - linearity and instability driven phase mixing between these modes , the plasma wave further de - coheres and equilibriates into random thermal motion .",
    "this increase in the entropy of the system follows from the second law of thermodynamics which makes the energy distribution equipartitioned between all possible modes of a system , driving it towards equilibrium .    in a future plasma collider ,",
    "the need for high luminosity would require each plasma stage to be re - used within a finite interval ( depending upon the drive bunch - train design ) .",
    "the fraction of drive - bunch energy coupled into the plasma that is absorbed by the accelerated - bunch has been shown to be @xmath12 under optimal non - linear beam - loading which implies significant energy leftover in the accelerating plasma structure .",
    "hence the next drive bunch would be affected by the thermalization of the wake from the previous pulses . in this paper",
    "we discuss the long - term evolution of a wake - perturbed plasma in terms of its temperature and density profile .",
    "we look at the electron momenta to determine if unabsorbed energy from a previous drive - bunch could heat the plasma to relativistic temperatures ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we use simulations to estimate the plasma diffusion timescales . past experimental work",
    "have imaged about 10 plasma periods behind the driver @xcite .",
    "the planar electron plasma wave in 1-d can be denoted as @xmath14 . the force equation of the plasma wave acting on a single plasma electron is @xmath15 . therefore , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . from the electron velocity we can estimate the kinetic energy of the single electron in the plasma wave , @xmath18 .",
    "if all the plasma electrons are picked up by the plasma wave , we can estimate the kinetic energy density of the electrons in the plasma wave as @xmath19 .",
    "the field energy density in the plasma wave fields is @xmath20 .",
    "using @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 . as @xmath23",
    ", there is an energy exchange between the kinetic energy of the oscillating electrons and the electric field of the wave .",
    "if the beam - loading of the plasma wave by an accelerated beam is @xmath24 , the energy leftover in the plasma can be estimated as @xmath25 .",
    "we study the density and temperature distribution of the plasma ( electrons and ions ) over @xmath26 cycle of @xmath3 and @xmath27 cycle of @xmath4 .",
    "to study the lte of a laser wakefield in the plasma , we use @xmath28 osiris@xcite pic code with eulerian specification of the plasma dynamics .",
    "we initialize the plasma density to @xmath29 with background ions of @xmath30 and pre - ionized singly - charged state .",
    "we have intentionally chosen a relatively high density plasma because @xmath31 .",
    "we resolve and reference the real time in simulation to the laser period @xmath32 thereby the dynamics within a single plasma cycle is simulated in just @xmath33 laser cycles .",
    "we discretize the space with 20 cells per skin - depth ( @xmath34 ) in the longitudinal and 10 cells per @xmath34 in the transverse direction .",
    "the simulation space size is chosen as 300 @xmath34 x 600 @xmath34 .",
    "we use absorbing boundary conditions for fields and particles of all species .",
    "the laser pulse is chosen to be a circularly polarized gaussian pulse with normalized vector potential @xmath35 with pulse width of @xmath36 .        from the simulations we observe that a plasma bubble is excited by the laser pulse , as seen in fig .",

    "[ lte - ion - density - evolution][a ] .",
    "we observe that the bubble oscillates for about 20 plasma periods .",
    "the more the oscillations are delayed in time , the more the bubble s transverse size decreases and the electron sheath around the bubble curves with smaller radii towards the back of the bubble .",
    "we also observe at the end of the bubble oscillations that the density of electrons in the sheath around the bubble reduces and the electron density is modulated further away from the axis of the bubble in the transverse direction . such a weak bubble with curved electron sheath",
    "may be observed around @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ lte - electron - density - evolution][b ] .        at later times",
    "we also observe that neighboring plasma bubbles merge into each other and the electrons in the sheath execute motion around the merged ion cavity .",
