    "beginning with the groundbreaking binary black hole evolutions of pretorius  @xcite and the development of the moving puncture method  @xcite , it has recently become possible to solve einstein s equations numerically for the inspiral , merger , and ringdown of two black holes in a binary orbit .",
    "already these simulations have provided tests of post - newtonian approximations  @xcite , have allowed initial exploration of the orbital dynamics of spinning binaries  @xcite , have determined the recoil velocity of the final black hole when the masses are unequal  @xcite , and have led to the discovery of dramatically large recoil velocity from certain spin configurations  @xcite .",
    "waveforms from these numerical simulations are important for gravitational - wave detectors such as ligo and lisa .",
    "this is not only because detected waveforms can be compared with numerical models to measure astrophysical properties of the sources of gravitational radiation , but also because the detection probability itself can be increased via the technique of matched filtering  @xcite , in which noisy data are convolved with numerical templates to enhance the signal .",
    "however , binary black hole simulations are time consuming : a single simulation following approximately 10 orbits , merger , and ringdown typically requires a few weeks of runtime on approximately 50 or 100 processors of a parallel supercomputer , and typically such a simulation produces waveforms of only modest accuracy .",
    "this large computational expense precludes , for example , producing a full template bank of numerical waveforms covering the entire parameter space of black hole masses and spins .",
    "hence there has been much interest in construction of phenomenological analytical waveforms  @xcite that can be computed quickly and are calibrated by a small number of numerical simulations . while the accuracy of typical simulations is sufficient for creating ligo detection templates , it is most likely inadequate for ligo parameter estimation and is far from what is required for lisa data analysis  @xcite .",
    "one approach to increasing the accuracy and efficiency of simulations is to adopt more efficient numerical methods .",
    "in particular , a class of numerical techniques known as spectral methods holds much promise . for smooth solutions ,",
    "the errors produced by spectral methods decrease exponentially as computational resources are increased , whereas the errors of finite difference methods , the methods used by the majority of binary black hole simulations , decrease polynomially .",
    "indeed , spectral methods have been used to produce very accurate initial data for binary black holes and neutron stars  @xcite , and they have been used to produce the longest and most accurate binary black hole inspiral simulation to date  @xcite .",
    "however , a key difficulty with time - dependent spectral binary black hole simulations has been handling the merger of the two holes . for example , the spectral simulations described in  @xcite are very accurate and efficient , but they follow only the inspiral of the two black holes , and fail just before the holes merge .",
    "this is sufficient for some applications , such as comparing post - newtonian formulae with numerical results during the inspiral and finding accurate analytic templates that match the numerical inspiral waveforms  @xcite , but for most purposes the merger is the most crucial part of the process : for instance the gravitational - wave emission is the strongest during merger , and details of the merger determine the recoil velocity of the final black hole .",

    "this code evolves a first - order representation  @xcite of the generalized harmonic system  @xcite .",
    "we handle the singularities by excising the black hole interiors from the computational domain .",
    "our outer boundary conditions  @xcite are designed to prevent the influx of unphysical constraint violations  @xcite and undesired incoming gravitational radiation  @xcite , while allowing the outgoing gravitational radiation to pass freely through the boundary .",
    "we employ the dual - frame method described in ref .",
    "@xcite : we solve the equations in an `` inertial frame '' that is asymptotically minkowski , but our domain decomposition is fixed in a `` comoving frame '' that rotates with respect to the inertial frame and also shrinks with respect to the inertial frame as the holes approach each other .",

    "the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are determined by a dynamical control system as described in ref .",
    "this control system dynamically adjusts @xmath11 and @xmath12 so that the centers of the apparent horizons remain stationary in the comoving frame .",
    "note that the outer boundary of the computational domain is at a fixed comoving radius @xmath15 , so the inertial - coordinate radius of the outer boundary @xmath16 is a function of time .",
    "the gauge freedom in the generalized harmonic system is fixed via a freely specifiable gauge source function @xmath17 that satisfies the constraint @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the spacetime christoffel symbols . to choose this gauge source function ,",
    "we first define a new quantity @xmath20 that has the following two properties : ( 1 ) @xmath20 transforms like a tensor , and ( 2 ) in inertial coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "we choose @xmath17 so that the constraint equation  ( [ e : ghconstr ] ) is satisfied initially , and we demand that @xmath22 is constant in the moving frame , _",
    "i.e. , _ that @xmath23 .",
    "if the inspiral runs described above are allowed to continue without any modification of the algorithm , then as the binary approaches merger , the horizons of the black holes become extremely distorted and the dynamical fields begin to develop sharp ( but numerically convergent ) features near each hole .",
    "these features grow rapidly in time , eventually halting the simulation before merger .",
    "this is due to a gauge effect : the gauge condition used during the inspiral , namely fixing @xmath17 in time in the comoving frame , was chosen based on the idea that each black hole is in quasiequilibrium in this frame .",
    "once the black holes begin to interact strongly , this gauge condition no longer allows the coordinates to sufficiently react to the changing geometry , and coordinate singularities develop .",
    "therefore we must modify our gauge conditions in order to handle merger . because the inspiral gauge works so well before merger",
    ", we choose to remain in that gauge until some time @xmath24 , and then we change ( smoothly ) to a new gauge .",
    "we have experimented with several gauge conditions  @xcite , but so far the simplest gauge choice that works , and the one used in the simulations presented here , is based on the gauge treatment of pretorius  @xcite : we promote the gauge source function @xmath17 to an independent dynamical field that satisfies @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the curved space _",

    "a different gauge choice that causes similar coordinate expansion of the horizons was introduced in ref .",
