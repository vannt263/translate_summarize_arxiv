    "the presence of the superconducting energy gap leads to a selective tunneling of high - energy quasiparticles out of the normal metal in a normal metal - insulator - superconductor ( nis ) tunnel junction .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon generates a heat current from the normal metal to the superconductor ( also referred to as `` cooling power '' ) .",
    "the heat transfer through nis junctions can be used for the realization of microcoolers .",
    "@xcite present state - of - the - art experiments allow the reduction of the electron temperature in a normal metal lead from 300 to about 100 mk , offering perspectives for on - chip cooling of nanosized systems , such as high - sensitive detectors and quantum devices .",
    "@xcite    the cooling power of tunnel junctions depends on several parameters , some of them controllable .",
    "for example the cooling power can be optimized by controlling the voltage across the junction .",
    "a maximized cooling effect is reached at a voltage bias just below the superconducting energy gap @xmath5 .",
    "larger values of voltage , @xmath8 , lead to a larger charge current @xmath9 through the junction and hence to larger values of the joule heating power , i.e. to a negative cooling power .",
    "a limitation of the performance of a nis microcooler arises also from the fact that nonequilibrium quasiparticles injected into the superconducting electrode accumulate near the tunnel interface .",
    "@xcite as a consequence hot quasiparticles may tunnel back into the normal metal , leading to a reduction of the cooling effect .",
    "@xcite in order to overcome this problem a so called quasiparticle trap,@xcite made of an additional normal metal layer has been attached to the superconducting electrode , removing hot quasiparticles from the superconductor .",
    "recently , it was also shown that a small magnetic field enhances relaxation processes in a superconductor and leads to significant improvement of the cooling power in nis junctions.@xcite improved cooling performance can be also achieved by proper tuning of the tunneling resistances of the individual nis tunnel junctions in a double junction sinis cooling device . @xcite    another important limitation for nis microcoolers arises from the intrinsic multi - particle nature of current transport in nis junctions which is governed not only by single - particle tunneling but also by two - particle processes due to the andreev reflection.@xcite while the single - particle current and the associated heat current are due to quasiparticles with energies @xmath10 , at low temperatures or high junction transparencies the charge transport in nis junctions is dominated by the andreev reflection , i.e. by subgap processes .",
    "the andreev current @xmath11 does not transfer heat through the ns interface but rather generates the joule heating @xmath12 . at low enough temperatures this heating exceeds the single - particle cooling.@xcite the interplay between",
    "the single - particle tunneling and andreev reflection sets a limiting temperature for the refrigeration @xmath13.@xcite    one way to decrease @xmath13 is to decrease the nis junction transparency .",
    "however , large values of the contact resistance hinder carrier transfer and lead to a severe limitation in the achievable cooling powers . in order to increase the junction transparency and at the same time to reduce the andreev current ,",
    "it was suggested to use materials where the proximity effect is suppressed , such as ferromagnets , ferromagnetic insulators , and half - metals .",
    "in particular giazotto _",
    "_ studied theoretically a ballistic normal metal - ferromagnet - superconductor structure within a phenomenological model and predicted an enhancement of the cooling efficiency compared to nis junctions.@xcite the reason for that increase lies in the suppression of the andreev reflection due to the band structure of the ferromagnetic metals .",
    "the electron involved in andreev reflection and its time - reversed counterpart ( hole ) must belong to opposite spin bands ; thus , suppression of the andreev current occurs in a fs junction and its intensity depends on the degree of the electron polarization at the fermi level which is proportional to the exchange field of the f layer.@xcite the enhancement of the cooling efficiency by the magnetic - field - driven tunable suppression of the andreev reflection in superconductor / two - dimensional electron gas nanostructures was also studied in ref .  .",
    "note that theoretical studies of electron cooling in sf proximity systems were performed only in the ballistic case , @xcite while real metallic systems are in the diffusive limit .",
    "moreover , ferromagnets show in general a multi - domain structure that was not considered in previous articles .    in this work we present a quantitative analysis of the thermoelectric transport in nis microcoolers with a diffusive ferromagnetic interlayer consisting of two magnetic domains with arbitrary direction of magnetization (",
    "so called `` superconducting triplet spin - valve''@xcite ) .",
    "based on the quasiclassical keldysh green functions formalism we compute the electric and heat currents through the junction .",
    "we show that the enhancement of the cooling power with respect to the nis case , as proposed in ref .  , only works if the exchange field of the ferromagnetic interlayer @xmath3 is much larger than the superconducting order parameter @xmath5 .",
    "however , the cooling power shows a minimum value for @xmath7 .",
    "we also study the dependence of the cooling power on the angle @xmath4 between the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic domains . in the case of weak ferromagnets ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath14 , the antiparallel configuration @xmath15 leads to higher values of the cooling power and smaller values of @xmath13 . by increasing @xmath3 this behavior",
    "is reversed and the mono - domain configuration ( @xmath16 ) is more favorable for the refrigeration . for large values of the exchange field ,",
    "@xmath17 , the cooling power is almost independent on @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we formulate the theoretical model and basic equations .",
    "in particular , we obtain the expressions for the electric and the heat current and identify the contributions corresponding to single - particle and andreev tunneling events . in section",

    "[ panelv ] , [ panelw ] and [ panelt ] the optimal voltage @xmath135 depends on the temperature @xmath182 , tunneling parameter @xmath60 and magnetic configuration angle @xmath4 . for the exchange field equal to the superconducting gap the maximal cooling power @xmath192 is largest in the antiparallel configuration , while for larger @xmath193 the largest value @xmath192 is in the parallel configuration , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ pvsh10 ] .",
    "[ panelw ] shows that the cooling power has also a maximum as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "increasing @xmath60 the cooling power first linearly increases as single electron tunneling dominates . for larger values of the tunneling parameter",
    ", the andreev current heating dominates over the single - particle cooling and leads to a rapid decrease of the cooling power , which tends to zero at a certain onset point .",
    "as the exchange field increases , the role of andreev processes becomes less important , therefore the onset shifts towards larger values of @xmath60 .",
    "this means that for higher exchange field in the ferromagnetic interlayer one may use weaker tunnel barriers for the microcooler fabrication , which leads to higher amplitudes of the cooling power [ see fig .",

    "we show the temperature dependence of the cooling power . at @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the critical temperature of the superconductor ,",
    "the cooling power becomes negative for all voltages .",
    "this value of the temperature holds for a wide range of parameters.@xcite the existence of such a maximal temperature is due to the increase of the number of thermally excited quasiparticles which produce enhanced joule heat . by lowering the temperature the cooling power at optimal bias first increases and reaches a maximum . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the joule heat due to andreev processes causes the cooling power to decrease . at a certain temperature @xmath196",
    ", the cooling power tends to zero , which defines the lower limiting temperature for the cooling regime . as follows from fig .",
    "[ panelt ] , the temperature @xmath196 decreases when increasing the exchange field ; this is because the andreev current and the associated joule heat are suppressed by the exchange interaction in the ferromagnet .",

    "[ panelt ] that the minimum cooling temperature in the parallel @xmath197 and antiparallel @xmath198 configuration satisfy : @xmath199 for @xmath185 , while @xmath200 for @xmath166 . for @xmath179 [ fig .",

    "2 . ]    a common feature of fig .",
    "[ panelv ] , [ panelw ] and [ panelt ] is that for rather small value of the exchange field , @xmath185 , the antiparallel configuration is more favorable for cooling [ see ( a ) panels ] . for larger exchange field @xmath204 , on the contrary",
    ", the parallel configuration is favorable for cooling [ see ( b ) panels ] .",
    "as expected , in the case of strong enough ferromagnet [ @xmath179 ] the thickness of f@xmath0 layer @xmath206 and the superconducting condensate practically does not penetrate into f@xmath1 layer .",
    "thus the cooling power is @xmath4-independent [ see ( c ) panels of figs .",
    "[ panelv ] , [ panelw ] and [ panelt ] ] .",
    "we have developed a quantitative theory of charge and heat transport in normal metal - superconductor tunnel junctions with an intermediate ferromagnetic bilayer . we have assumed that the magnetizations of the ferromagnets form an angle @xmath4 and focused our study on the cooling power of such a structure .    in the previous works",
    "it has been suggested that the larger the exchange field the more efficient the cooling.@xcite in this case the enhancement of the cooling is due to the suppression of the andreev processes and therefore suppression of the joule heating , released in the normal metal electrode .",
    "however , our results have shown that this hypothesis is only valid in the case of strong ferromagnets [ @xmath17 ] . for weak ferromagnets with an exchange field comparable to the superconducting order parameter",
    "@xmath5 the cooling power shows a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath3 , with a minimum at @xmath7 ( in mono - domain case ) that corresponds to a maximum in the andreev current @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , around this minimum the cooling power of the sif@xmath0f@xmath1n structure is even lower than the one of the nis junction .",
    "we have also shown that in the two - domain case , a finite value of @xmath4 shifts the minimum of cooling power to larger values of @xmath3 if the thickness of f@xmath0 is comparable to the magnetic length @xmath160 . in this case , the effective exchange field @xmath159 acting on the cooper pairs is gradually reduced as @xmath4 increases from @xmath162 to @xmath32 .",
    "the minimum then is at @xmath208 which corresponds to larger values of the bare @xmath3 .",
    "thus , for exchange fields @xmath209 the antiparallel magnetic configuration ( @xmath210 ) of magnetization leads to larger values of the cooling power .",
    "such small exchange fields can be realized in weak ferromagnetic alloys,@xcite or in hybrid structures consisting of ferromagnetic insulators in contact with superconductors.@xcite for values of @xmath3 larger than @xmath5 , the parallel configuration ( @xmath211 ) is the one that leads to larger values of the cooling power . for values of @xmath17",
    "the cooling is almost independent of @xmath4 .",
