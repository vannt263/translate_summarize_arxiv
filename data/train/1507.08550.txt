    "interstellar extinction curves ( isecs ) are now available for many lines of sight in the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) , in the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc , lmc ) , in m31 , in nearby galaxies , and increasingly in objects at high redshift .",
    "the isecs have a great variety of shapes .",
    "this evidence may seem to suggest that grain models must be complex , allowing for different carriers for each of the different components of the isecs .",
    "however , all the measured extinction profiles are clearly members of the same family , and in fact , isecs can be phenomenologically described by means of a very limited number of empirical parameters @xcite .",
    "such a smooth topological transition among extinction profiles may be naturally interpreted as the response of dust to the local physics .",
    "dust grains are composed mainly of silicates and carbons , as made clear by spectroscopic evidence and depletion data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are formed in the envelopes of cool stars and in novae and supernovae , and are destroyed in shocks , but with different efficiencies , silicates being more resistant than carbons @xcite .",
    "even if the silicates and carbons can be produced as separate populations , the destruction of solid carbons to atoms and small molecules will lead to carbon deposition on silicate cores . according to the scenario originally envisaged by @xcite , gaseous carbon in diffuse clouds",
    "is gradually deposited on silicate cores in hydrogen rich @xmath1 form , and is eventually annealed and darkened to graphitic ( h - poor ) @xmath2 kind by the interstellar radiation field . in other words , dust is not immutable and is expected to evolve in time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such dust formation and evolution scenario has been implemented in a model   the [ cm]@xmath3 model @xcite   successfully applied to a sample of 329 galactic lines of sights @xcite by @xcite .    subsequently , the carbon evolution prescriptions of this scenario were condensed in a set of timedependent equations , describing carbon deposition onto the silicate cores and its following photo - darkening , and matched to the observationally based inferences of dust physical parameters @xcite , closing the circle .",
    "most of the isecs in the @xcite sample correspond to dust mantles that restarted growing after being almost completely removed , with the leftover fully rehydrogenated , by , e.g. , occasional shocks .",
    "a natural extension of this work is its application to ( and test with ) environments markedly different from the interstellar medium of the solar neighborhood , in which the life cycle of the interstellar medium is known to be very different either globally , e.g. , much more frequent shocks as in starburst galaxies , or locally , because of independent observational constraints on individual lines of sight . in this paper",
    "we shall apply the [ cm]@xmath3 model to a number of lines of sight in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , whose data have been provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these two irregular dwarf galaxies are nearby ( @xmath4  kpc ) , gasrich , actively star - forming , and have sub - solar metallicities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the smc average isec presents a featureless profile with no 217.5 nm bump and a steep far ultraviolet rise , while the lmc one shows a hint of the bump and a firm far - ultraviolet rise , stronger than in the mwg but less sharp than in the smc .",
    "we describe the specific lines of sight , their known physical properties , and how they are modelled in section  [ mod ] , the resulting characterisation of dust grains along such extinction paths in section  [ res ] , section  [ discussection ] contains our discussion and the last section summarises our conclusions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite exploited a collection of newly taken and archive data to obtain individual extinction curves for a total of 24 lines of sight : 19 for lmc and 5 for smc .",
    "the list of sight lines reported in table  [ one ] contains also their absolute visual magnitude , @xmath5 , the ratio of total to selective extinction , @xmath6 , and the gas to dust ratio expressed as @xmath7 @xmath8  mag@xmath9 .",
    "this quantity has been constructed for specific lines of sight using data taken from @xcite and references therein : the atomic hydrogen column density is derived from absorption lyman-@xmath10 profiles in all cases but sk-69  279 , for which we used data from the hydrogen 21 cm emission ; the molecular hydrogen column density is obtained from _ fuse _ h@xmath11 absorption measurements when available , or otherwise exploiting the relation linking @xmath12 to @xmath13 , as found by @xcite for the mwg .",
    "in addition to individual lines of sight , we also considered the `` average '' extinction curves given by @xcite for the smc bar , the lmc  2 supershell ( ss ) , and the overall lmc average .",
    "these average extinction curves were treated exactly as the individual ones , to see if this resulted in a sensible description of representative dust properties for the areas they refer to .",

    "the variancecovariance matrix for the bestfitting parameters , measuring how tightly they are constrained by the fit , is obtained by synthetic statistics , by repeating the fit multiple times on data perturbed according to their errors .",

    "the differential equations thus constitute a oneparameter system : solutions starting from the same initial conditions , but with different photodarkening times , have no other points in common but the starting point and the asymptotic limit .",
    "of course , the evolutionary model also has a parametric dependence on the assumed environmental conditions , i.e. the elemental abundances and so on .",

    "[ pahtable ] we also report the charge dispersion , @xmath70 $ ] , a measure of the homogeneity of the charging within the pah distribution .",
    "the total absolute column density of carbon locked in pahs is not an outcome of the fit , since we are dealing with normalized extinction , but it can derived through the absolute extinction ( see table  [ one ] ) .",
    "the statistics of the mc sample are relatively small ( 24 lines of sight in total ) . nevertheless , some trends are already clear .",
    "the fitting results presented in table  [ classictable ] occupy a slightly larger volume of the parameter space with respect to the galactic corresponding values . in particular , while for the mwg lines of sight the size distribution of classical grains is always bimodal with no exceptions ( see table  1 in @xcite ) , with a gap in size @xmath71 between @xmath72 and 200  nm , there are a few mc lines of sight for which the size distribution shows a negligible gap ( i.e. azv214 , sk-69  228 and one of the degenerate solutions for azv23 ) . in general , while there is considerable scatter in both , median values of @xmath73 are smaller in the mcs with respect to those we previously found for the mwg .",
    "the same can be seen if one compares the fits for the average mwg isec to the average isecs for the mcs .",
    "another important difference between the two samples resides in the predominant presence of @xmath1 carbon mantles in the mcs .",
    "the @xmath74 fraction is different from zero only in four cases , namely sk-68 26 , sk-69  256 , sk-69  210 , and azv23 ( see table  [ classictable ] ) , while in the mwg carbonaceous mantles tend to be overwhelmingly aromatic .",
    "this is particularly significant as mcs have generally stronger radiation fields than the mwg ( up to ten times higher , @xcite ) .    from figs .",
    "[ smcfitcurves ] and [ lmcfitcurves ] , it is evident that classical dust dominates the extinction profile , with some exceptions in the bump spectral region . in only one isec",
    "( sk-69  256 ) pahs may be dominant in the whole range , depending on which of the formally acceptable solutions is the real one .",
    "the pah charge dispersion decreases with increasing pah charge ( fig .",
    "[ charge ] ) suggesting that when the mixture charge is not negligible all molecular species tend to assume the same charge value , as characteristic during e.g. , photoionization ( modulo the differences in the photo - absorption cross - sections ) . on the other side ,",
    "large charge dispersions are expected when a superposition of different environments , with different physical conditions , are crossed by a line of sight . in this case",
    "the average charges of individual regions merge to a median , close to zero , value , but with a large spread around it .",
    "figure  [ abundances ] shows in graphical form the total abundances of c and si locked in dust and pahs that we obtained in this work for the sightlines to the mcs examined here , also listed in table  [ masstable ] , compared with the corresponding values we previously obtained for the mwg @xcite and with some reference values for the total elemental abundances .",
    "the level of compatibility of the amounts of si and c locked in dust in the mcs with abundance constraints is at least as good as that for the mwg , with a similar fraction of data points exceeding mildly the nominal ( average ) budget of available si , c constraints almost always respected , one spectacular failure for lmc , one for the smc and one for the mwg ( not visible , because it falls out of the plot ) .",

    "they can be compared with the results of @xcite , obtained fitting a dust emission model to herschel data .",
    "while of course our data points are very sparse , compared to all the pixels in the maps of the mcs , as used by @xcite , they do fall in the same area of the @xmath83@xmath84 plane covered by their data , and are therefore fully consistent with them .",
    "this is rather interesting , since the two datasets were obtained using completely different observations ( emission versus absorption ) and dust models .     and normalized @xmath2 mantle carbon fraction , with relative errors for the smc ( red asterisks ) , the lmc ( blue asterisks ) , and the mwg ( pale grey symbols ) . the black symbol marked `` mw '' represents the values corresponding to the average galactic isec .",
    "values corresponding to average isecs in the mcs are also indicated .",
    "mwg data are taken from @xcite . ]    in @xcite we outlined a selfconsistent evolutionary scenario for dust in the diffuse ism ( dism ) in the mwg . in such model , silicate grain particles , being relatively longlived , progressively accrete c atoms in an hrich environment ( the dism ) , thereby forming aliphatic carbonaceous mantles .",
    "the older layers of these mantles are progressively photoprocessed to aromatic , while new aliphatic material simultaneously continue to deposit on top of them .",
    "the deposition of carbon is assumed to be proportional to the rate of collisions of c atoms onto dust grains , with a sticking factor calibrated to match observational constraints on co abundances .",
    "since dust evolution is modelled in diffuse and translucent clouds , which are rich in atomic h , all freshly deposited carbonaceous material is assumed to be highly hydrogenated , i.  e. aliphatic . upon uv irradiation , carbonaceous material",
    "is assumed to be dehydrogenated , becoming more and more aromatic . to simplify the model , carbonaceous material , instead of having a continuous",
    ", smooth transition between deeper , older , and thus more aromatic material , and freshly deposited , aliphatic material , is represented as just two layers , the deeper one completely aromatic , the other completely aliphatic . occasionally , shocks peel away most of this material , restarting the cycle and ejecting the fragments of carbonaceous mantles into the gas , where they can possibly be a source of pahs .",
    "shocks are not explicitely included in the set of differential equations giving the time evolution of the grain mantles , but are taken into account in terms of `` instantaneous '' episodes , removing most of the carbonaceous mantles , rehydrogenating the small leftover , and putting back into the gas phase the resulting carbon ; the time evolution , according to the differential equations of the model , is then resumed from these new initial conditions .    upon trying to use this kind of evolutionary scenario to interpret the isecs observed in the mcs , as shown in fig.[mcevofig ] ,",
    "it is apparent that the annealing time scale must be almost always much longer than the average time between mantleshattering events .",
    "the annealing scale is defined by the competition between energetic processing by uv radiation ( and cosmic rays ) and rehydrogenation by hot h atomic gas , turning aromatic carbonaceous material back into aliphatic . in the mwg ,",
    "rehydrogenation was deemed to be by and large negligible , but this may be not the case in the mcs .",
    "carbonaceous mantles in the mcs result from the fit to be almost always completely aliphatic , with only few exceptions .",
    "this points to significantly higher starformation activities , and associated supernova rates , and/or much longer photoprocessing timescales , possibly due to more effective rehydrogenation .",
    "this is in agreement with the current star formation rates in the mcs ( @xmath85 in the smc , @xcite and @xmath86  @xmath87  yr@xmath9 in the lmc , @xcite ) that per unit area are an order of magnitude higher than in the mwg ( @xmath88  yr@xmath9 , @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "observations of stellar populations in dwarf galaxies suggest that the star formation bursts are sporadic , separated by millions to billions of years even in isolated systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . according to their starformation histories @xcite",
    ", the mcs appear to be typical members of this class of galaxies .",
    "mctype isecs may be then prototypical of dwarf galaxies of low metallicity , with high gas content ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the mwg dism",
    "the photo - darkening time is @xmath89  yr @xcite , @xmath90 being local fluctuations around the average intensity of the interstellar uv radiation field .",
    "such time should be compared with lifetime of carbon mantles against sputtering ( whose estimate is not a trivial task ) . assuming a plausible shock frequency of @xmath91  yr@xmath9 @xcite",
    ", we derive that dust mantles in the mwg dism have enough time to be converted in aromatic structure .",
    "@xcite show that the evolutionary age of isecs peaks at times of few myr ( assuming typical diffuse interstellar conditions ) comparable to the probable average age of diffuse clouds . translating these considerations to the dism in the mcs",
    ", we may conclude that the carbon recycling time must be much shorter than the local photodarkening time , @xmath92  yr ( @xmath93 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such result should be taken with care , as many effects are concurring in dust destruction and formation processes .",
    "for instance , small grains are more susceptible to destruction by sputtering in shock waves than large grains @xcite , because larger grains decouple from the gas and are therefore less exposed to ions . in strong shocks ,",
    "graingrain interaction may lead to shattering and thus to the creation of smaller grains @xcite , which are then more likely to be sputtered away .",
    "hence , the timescale of dust destruction may be inversely proportional to the abundance of dust , since the rate of collisions is proportional to the grain number density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although pahs are clearly less abundant in the mcs than in the mwg ( see table  [ pahtable ] ) , a potential problem in our description of the carbon cycle in galaxies is posed by the the sharp decline of the source of aromatic material in the dism , since most of dust mantles are destroyed before they experience a substantial annealing .",
    "pah formation rates in the cold , carbonrich winds of evolved stars are too slow , the injection time being approximately 2  gy .",
    "surveys in smc also revised down the contribution of agb stars to dust production ( e.g. , @xcite ) . without a net positive contribution from supernovae to the dust budget , this suggests that dust must grow in the dism or be formed by another yet unknown mechanism ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recent _ herschel _ photometric and spectroscopic observations of the supernova 1987a by @xcite may suggest that supernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium , from local to high - redshift galaxies .",
    "however , the point is controversial as it depends on the efficiency of supernova remnants in destroyng interstellar grains .",
    "@xcite determined dust lifetimes in the mcs exploiting the available data of supernova remnants for these galaxies .",
    "these authors inferred dust lifetimes in the mcs significantly shorter then in the mwg , as the cumulative dust production rates by agb stars and supernovae are one order of magnitude lower than dust destruction in interstellar shocks produced by the expansion of supernova remnants    conversely , we are left with the puzzle of what becomes of the aliphatic fragments released into the dism of the mcs by the shattering events .",
    "@xcite proposed that they should be rapidly evaporated into polyyines , and thereafter quickly photodissociated under dism conditions .",
    "they would therefore have a negligible effect on the extinction .",
    "if instead a significant population of aliphatic carbonaceous nanoparticles were able to survive for a significant time , thereby achieving nonnegligible abundances , they should be visible both in extinction , exhibiting @xmath94 features contributing mainly to the nonlinear faruv rise , and given their small sizes possibly producing aliphatic ch emission .",
    "indeed , some emission in the aliphatic ch stretch at 3.4  @xmath95 m is detected toward the mcs @xcite .",
    "classical dust extinction is generally larger than pah extinction with a few exceptions . in these latter cases ,",
    "the pah contribution dominates only in the bump region . in all these relatively `` pahrich '' cases ,",
    "the classical size distribution is strongly bimodal , with a gap ranging from 40 to 130 nm , with a tendency to increase the non linearity of the faruv rise with increasing size breaks .",
    "all the remaining isecs are reproduced with classic grain size distributions that tend to have markedly lower gaps ( see table  [ classictable ] ) .",
    "in @xcite we concluded that , in the framework of [ cm]@xmath3 model , bumpless extinction curves are not necessarily lines of sight devoid of pahs , but rather that the @xmath96 pah absorption can be very effectively masked by a large gap between the maximum size limit of small dust grains and the minimum size limit of large ones .",
    "mwg data were not conclusive since mc - type isecs are rare in our galaxy .",
    "the present results suggest a different interpretation based on the fact that some isecs show a more or less weak non - linear far - uv rise without showing an appreciable bump .",
    "this is particularly evident in the smc sub sample . in the lmc",
    "the most evident trends are small bumps with linear far - uv rises . within the current model dust populations , for the smc - type isec",
    "the only possibility is the introduction of pahs that , through @xmath97 absorptions , may produce such rise .",
    "however , as a by product , pah molecules exhibit @xmath96 transitions who generate the bump .",
    "thus , the only viable solution , for bumpless isecs , is the removal of mid - size grains , whose extinction power falls in the bump region , from the grain size distribution .",
    "this may be interpreted in two alternative ways .",
    "the first one is that we must be missing an @xmath98dominated carbon component , whose sizes are intermediate between small solids and macromolecules .",
    "this is also hinted by the numerical tendency during the fitting procedure to go below the lowest limit of 5 nm in particle size , that is systematic for all the lines of sight in the mwg and in the mcs .",
    "such small particles might be carbon mantle fragments , possibly produced during some destructive events ( as discussed in the previous paragraph ) , such as e.  g. nanodiamonds @xcite .",
    "the second interpretation is instead that in our model we are missing no important component contributing to extinction , and hence the fact that pahs are abundant only if middlesized dust grains are absent is real , and must have a sound physical explanation .",
    "one might argue that if an interstellar cloud , and the dust therein , underwent some shocks in its history , they may have shattered middlesized grains , producing fragments ( small grains ) and releasing pahs from the disrupted carbonaceous mantles .",
    "this would be a consistent explanation for the mwg , where carbonaceous mantles are almost entirely aromatic , so that their disruption would indeed produce pahlike fragments .",
    "but in the mcs carbonaceous mantles result to be almost entirely aliphatic , so their destruction can hardly be a viable source of pahs .    in the case of lmctype isecs the results of the fitting procedure are more straightforward than for the smctype , bumpless ones : in this galaxy pahs are present but are a minor component , their presence being only evident in the bump spectral region .",
    "the possible extra aliphatic `` mesoscopic '' component is marginal in this case .",
    "conversely , the problem of the lack of a suitable source of aromatic material is therefore more pressing for lmc than smc .",
    "we here concisely summarise the main conclusions of this work .    *",
    "the [ cm]@xmath3 dust model can very precisely match all the isecs observed in the mcs , yielding estimates for the total dust mass column density versus total hydrogen column density that are fully consistent with those obtained by @xcite in a completely different , independent way .",
    "* abundance of elements locked up in [ cm]@xmath3 models fitting the isecs in the mcs are at least as compatible with abundance constraints as those for the mwg @xcite .",
    "* when isecs have vanishingly weak bump and faruv nonlinear rise , they can be equally well fitted either by classical dust alone or by classical dust _ and _ pahs . in such cases models without pahs",
    "use much more si and c atoms , which may put them at odds with abundance constraints .",
    "* carbonaceous mantles in the mcs resulting from the [ cm]@xmath3 model fits are overwhelmingly aliphatic , whereas those in the mwg are predominantly aromatic .",
    "together with the observational constraint that radiation fields in mcs are typically 10 times stronger than the average in the mwg @xcite , in the [ cm]@xmath3 model this implies that mantleshattering events must be @xmath99 times more frequent in the mcs than in the mwg , and/or much more efficient .",
    "desorption from such mantles can not be a significant source of pahs in the mcs .",
    "* bumpless isecs with large nonlinear faruv rises can be fitted within the [ cm]@xmath3 model , but this requires a finely tuned match of the gap in the size distribution of classical dust grains , resulting in a dip in the extinction they produce that precisely cancels with the bump . either there is some hitherto not understood physical relation connecting the population of pahs with the size distribution of silicate grains in the diffuse interstellar medium , or this hints that the [ cm]@xmath3 model must be missing some component different from pahs that can can produce a nonlinear faruv rise without simultaneously contributing to the bump .",
