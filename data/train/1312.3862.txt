    "the main reason is that the interacting rate @xmath183 is proportional to the photon - neutrino scattering cross - section @xmath184 , which is very small .    to compare with the photon - neutrino scattering rate @xmath183 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the rate of generating circular polarization of laser photons presented in this letter . the quantity @xmath185 of eq .",
    "( [ v22 ] ) represents the number of circularly polarized photons of energy @xmath186 per unit area ( @xmath187 ) , unit time ( @xmath188 ) in a laser pulse .",
    "therefore the rate of generating circular polarization of laser photons can be estimated by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the time duration of a laser pulse , the effective area of photon - neutrino interaction is represented by the laser - beam size @xmath191 being smaller than the neutrino - beam size @xmath147 , and the laser repetition rate @xmath192 is the number of laser pulses per second . to have more efficiency , we assume that laser and neutrino beams are synchronized and the @xmath192 is equal to the repetition rate of neutrino beam @xmath193 , which is the number of neutrino bunches per second .",
    "in contrast with the rate of photon - neutrino scattering @xmath194 , the rate @xmath195 of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) linearly depends on @xmath196 via the @xmath185 of eq .",
    "( [ v22 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the rate @xmath195 of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) should be much larger than the photon - neutrino scattering rate @xmath183 considered in ref .  @xcite .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ v25 ] ) and ( [ rate ] ) , we obtain @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the number of photons in a laser pulse @xmath199 and the total energy of a laser pulse @xmath200 . the averaged power of linearly polarized laser beam is approximately given by @xmath201 , then eq .  ( [ rate2 ] ) becomes @xmath202 as a result , with a neutrino beam @xmath203 and a linearly polarized laser beam of energy @xmath204ev and power @xmath205mw , the rate of generating circularly polarized photons @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "this rate should be large enough for observations .",
    "we show and discuss the reason why a linearly polarized photon acquires its circular polarization by interacting with a neutrino is due to the fact that the neutrino is left - handed and possesses chiral gauge - coupling to gauge bosons . calculating the ratio of linear and circular polarizations of photons interacting with either dirac or majorana neutrinos",
    ", we obtain that this ratio in the case of dirac neutrinos is about twice less than the ratio in the case of majorana neutrinos . based on quantitative value of this ratio",
    ", we discuss the possibility of using advanced laser facilities and the t2k neutrino experiment to measure the circular polarization of laser beam interacting with neutrino beam in ground laboratories .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rate of neutrino - photon scattering was calculated by the feynman diagram of one fermion- loop with exchanging a @xmath63-boson ( neutral current channel ) .",
    "this rate is very small because the obtained cross - section of photon - neutrino is the order of @xmath208 , and it was concluded that the total probability for photon - neutrino scattering is too small to be observed ( having an event rate below 1/year ) , even at pw laser powers . in our case , the time evaluation of the @xmath5-parameter ( [ bo ] ) for the photon circular polarization can be simply written as @xmath209+\\int dt [ h^0_i,[h^0_i , v]],\\label{v5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the leading non - trivial contribution comes from the forward scattering amplitude @xmath210 $ ] , which is the order of @xmath211 , instead of @xmath212 . whereas the second term @xmath213 $ ] corresponds to the high - order contributions .",
    "this implies that our results ( [ fv2 m ] ) and ( [ v25 ] ) of generating circular polarization of laser beam by interacting with neutrino beam might be experimentally measurable .",
