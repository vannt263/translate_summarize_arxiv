    "<S> i ) . as mentioned previously , the emergence of magnetic field @xmath38 will significantly change the ground state configurations of order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> especially in the @xmath56(bec ) limit , where two fermions can form a deeply bound state , the many - body system can be viewed as a cloud of weakly interacting bosonic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> and the bosons should condense to the lowest landau level on the sphere . in the monopole field @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> , the lowest landau level is three - fold degenerate and the eigen functions(monopole harmonics ) are given by wigner - d matrices @xmath57@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this also serves as a benchmark for our many - body calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> ii ) . from eq.([eq_chi ] ) , one can see that two dimer wave functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are coupled to each other through two - body wave function @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling corresponds to the physical process that a @xmath61 molecule breaks into two fermions and recombines into a @xmath62 molecule on the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is a unique feature of curved surfaces because the angular momentum conservation would forbid the transition process on the plane . </S>",
    "<S> thus , on the many - body level , we may expect the @xmath8 cooper pairs can also be transformed into the @xmath3 cooper pairs due to the curvature effect , which can enrich possible phases of the ground state .        </S>",
    "<S> _ many - body ground state . </S>",
    "<S> _ to study the ground state of the many - body system , we apply the bcs theory . by approximating the molecule field @xmath63 by its expectation value @xmath64 ( correspondingly </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath65 is the order parameter of @xmath66 superfluid ) , we obtain the mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath67 where @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field hamiltonian is diagonalized through a bogoliubov transformation @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 is the normalized nambu spinor field on the sphere and satisfies the bdg equations , @xmath71 where @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that @xmath73 satisfies @xmath74 which preserves the particle - hole symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap equation is obtained through the variation of the ground state energy @xmath75 , which gives @xmath76 and the number equation is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the summation @xmath79 should be restricted to @xmath80@xcite .    to solve the bdg equation together with the gap equation and the number equation self consistently , </S>",
    "<S> we expand the order parameter as @xmath81 note that both the bdg equation and the gap equation preserve the so@xmath82 rotation symmetry along @xmath83 axis . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to simplify the numerics by assuming the order parameter only contains one @xmath84 component . and </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry will assure the other @xmath84 components remain zero during the iterative process .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , for different quantum number @xmath84 , we may calculate the order parameter @xmath85 separately . and </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is obtained by comparing their free energies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> _ since the effective range for @xmath0-wave scattering is approximately a constant across the feshbach resonance@xcite , we fix the ratio of effective range and the radius of the sphere @xmath86 in all calculations . </S>",
    "<S> then the ground state properties are fully controlled by two dimensionless parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is related to the fermion density @xmath90 by @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> here we only present the results of @xmath92 and @xmath93 channels since the numerics show that these are the three lowest energy channels . </S>",
    "<S> they are smooth connected to the three degenerate monopole harmonics in the bec limit . in the following , we first discuss these two cases separately and compare their free energy afterwards .    in fig.([m=0 ] ) , we plot the order parameter in @xmath92 channel @xmath94 for different @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we could see that the order parameters always vanish at the north and south pole . </S>",
    "<S> although the order parameters are real , the emergent gauge field gives nonzero velocity@xcite , which leads to a @xmath95 phase winding . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the @xmath92 solutions correspond to a phase with two vortices locate on the north and south poles respectively . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , as we tune the interaction , there are two significant phenomena demonstrating the effects of sphere from two aspects .    </S>",
    "<S> one is the change of vortex size . </S>",
    "<S> when we tune the interaction towards the bec(@xmath96 ) or the bcs(@xmath97 ) side , the vortices grow larger , which is consistent with the trend of healing length in a planar system . in the extreme bec or bcs limit , the vortex size saturates when it is comparable with the system size @xmath6 . and </S>",
    "<S> the order parameters are well approximated by monopole harmonics @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in both limits the interaction terms in the ginzburg - landau theory are negligible and the minimization of kinetic energy forces the order parameters to keep in the lowest landau level , whose wave function is given by the monopole harmonics .    </S>",
    "<S> the other is the change of the ratio between @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in subplot ( a ) and ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that the order parameter @xmath99 is much larger than @xmath100 , which means the ground state is a @xmath8 superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with the previous study on @xmath0-wave superfluid on the plane@xcite . while this conclusion changes completely in the deep bcs regime . </S>",
    "<S> since the cooper pair size grows exponentially in this limit , it will soon become comparable with the radius @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the cooper pair feels the curvature of the sphere . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the two - body process that couples @xmath99 pairs to @xmath100 pairs becomes very significant in bcs side . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our numerics shows that the system is in @xmath101 pairing instead of @xmath8 in bcs limit .     as functions of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath103 ( a ) : @xmath104 ( b ) : @xmath105,height=172 ]    in fig.([m=1 ] ) we plot the order parameters in @xmath106 channel @xmath107 for different interaction strength @xmath88 ( the @xmath108 channel are related by a reflection ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the numerics show that the @xmath106 phase only exists in bcs side , we only present the result in @xmath109 regime . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the @xmath93 channel corresponds to the configuration with a domain wall between @xmath66 phases .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to the @xmath92 phase , the size of the domain wall also increases towards the bcs limit . in the deep bcs regime , </S>",
    "<S> the domain wall moves to the equator and its size saturates when it is comparable with the radius of the sphere . and </S>",
    "<S> the order parameters @xmath110 are well approximated by monopole harmonics @xmath111 .    </S>",
    "<S> after comparing the energies of different @xmath84 channels , we obtain a phase diagram of the system . as shown in fig.([phase_d ] ) , the ground state may exhibit topological defects such as vortex pairs(@xmath92 ) or domain walls(@xmath93 ) depending on the interaction strength @xmath88 and radius @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> in the bec limit , the system is described by repulsive interacting molecules condensing at the lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> then it is straightforward to show that the interaction energy of @xmath92 channel is lower . </S>",
    "<S> numerics suggest this remains ture for the whole bec side and the phase diagram on this side can be understood .    on the bcs side , </S>",
    "<S> the system may undergo phase transitions from the @xmath93 phase to the @xmath92 phase , when we change the radius @xmath6 . recall that the domain wall energy is proportional to its length . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the domain wall phase energetically unfavored for large @xmath6 , which gives the phase transition in @xmath112 limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , in @xmath113 limit , this argument breaks down since the healing length is now comparable to the system size @xmath6 . to see what happens in this limit , we did an calculation based on ginzburg - landau theory ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it shows that the vortex pair phase has lower free energy in small @xmath6 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath93 phase can be further separated into two phases . in ( c ) phase , </S>",
    "<S> the domain wall is exactly on the equator . </S>",
    "<S> while in ( b ) phase , the z@xmath114 reflection symmetry is broken , and the domain wall moves to the northern or southern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> the z@xmath114 phase transition can be explained by a competition between the domain wall energy and the kinetic energy of the superfluid@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ we consider a microscopic model describing fermions with p - wave interaction on a sphere and study its ground state properties . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the curvature of the sphere induces an emergent magnetic monopole field coupled to the closed channel molecules , which necessarily leads to topological defects in superfluid ground state . by solving the bdg together with gap and number equations self consistently , we identify three phases with different types of topological defects and obtain the phase diagram .    </S>",
