    "a familiar and simple example of this type of phenomena is a circuit in which current flows between normal ( n ) metal elements though a superconductor ( s ) . because of andreev reflection of the quasiparticle current at the n / s boundary",
    ", the cooper pair amplitude in the superconductor is altered . in the presence of a normal metal transport current ,",
    "the superconducting order parameter developes a spatial gradient in the steady state which allows the condensate to carry current through the superconducting element .",
    "a more recent example is quantum hall bilayers which develop excitonic condensates@xcite under certain conditions and exhibit anomalies related@xcite to the influence of transport currents on interlayer phase coherence .",
    "an important class of related phenomena which has received a large amount of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite attention over the past decade is centered on the influence of transport currents on magnetization in magnetic metals , particularly ferromagnetic nanoparticles and ferromagnets containing domain walls . in this case",
    "the current - related torques exerted on the magnetization can usually be understood at least qualitatively by appealing to conservation of total spin : the magnetization torques are understood as the reaction counterpart to the action of the magnet s collective exchange field on the quasiparticles , _",
    "i.e. _ as spin - transfer torques ( stts ) . in stt physics , transport electrons can change the magnetic state of the device , by switching the orientation , or inducing microwave frequency oscillations in the orientation of magnetic layers .",
    "these phenomona hold out the promise of applications , for example for writing magnetically stored information .",
    "calculations of stts generally proceed by computing the spatial dependence of spin currents in a circuit and invoking conservation of spin angular momentum to infer the torque which acts on the magnetization .",
    "this approach has so far had mixed levels of success in predicting important quantities like critical currents for magnetization switching .",
    "most calculations to date have been based on free electron or on semi - empirical tight - binding models . in this paper",
    "we discuss a practical scheme for estimating the influence of transport currents on order - paramater dynamics in superconductors , magnetic metals , or hybrid systems .",
    "our approach , which is explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , starts by assuming a time - dependent mean - field theory in which the electron dynamics is described by a single - particle hamiltonian which is uniquely defined by the density - matrix of the system . in practice the most flexible and powerful choice for such a time - dependent mean - field theory",
    "will normally be spin - density functional theory , although any similar mean - field - like approximation is consistent with the procedures outlined below . hartree - fock theory , for example , has the same structure and has the advantage of being able to describe non - local exchange effects which might be important under some circumstances , for example when current is carried by a partially occupied bonding band.we then make an adiabatic approximation by assumming that the time - dependence of the single - particle hamiltonian can be ignored , and use non - equilibrium greens function ( negf ) theory to evaluate the influence of a bias voltage on the system density matrix .",
    "our implementation of negf theory is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : negf ] .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is normally appropriate since the driving terms are proportional to transport current and are typically weak compared to characteristic energy scales . since our interest is in nanoscale systems , the neglect of inelastic scattering in the system implied by the use of steady state negf theory",

    "the influence of current on order parameter dynamics follows from the dependence of the density - matrix on bias voltage for any given single - particle hamiltonian .    in the remaining sections of the paper",
    ", we apply our theory of current - induced order parameter dynamics to a co / cu / co spin - valve system , an example of transition metal ferromagnet spintronics which is of great practical importance and has recieved considerable attention . in sec .",

    "sec : conclusions ] , we review our results and outline some other interesting potential applications of this microscopic theory of order parameter dynamics in nanostructures .",
    "the practical scheme for microscopic calculation of order parameter dynamics outlined in this section is based on a previously decribed microscopic theory of spin - transfer torques in circuits containing ferromagnetic metal nanoparticles.@xcite this scheme views spin - transfer torques as a specific example of a more general class of phenomena in which collective dynamics is altered by a bias voltage because of the change it induces in the relationship between the single - particle density matrix and the effective single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "this microscopic view of current - induced order parameter dynamics in magnetic metals has consequences that might be significant in some instances , for example in circuits containing antiferromagnetic metal elements.@xcite in this section we explain the approach , using a notation that is convenient for the negf calculations we apply co / cu / co spin - valves in the body of the paper .",

    "an important distinction is that between in - plane torques , which are non - energy conserving and present only in non - equilibrium cases , and out - of - plane torques , which are the result of itinerant electron exchange , and are responsible for rkky - like interactions between layers .",

    "the relation between partitioning stt by orbital and spin - dependent hopping can be understood in the following way : when summing over orbital spin fluxes , normally intra - orbital spin currents cancel , so that such spurious contributions do not contribute to the total spin flux into / out of the atom .",
    "if there is spin - dependent hopping , such contributions do not cancel .",
    "if spin - dependent hopping is weak , however , these spurious contributions are negligible ."
