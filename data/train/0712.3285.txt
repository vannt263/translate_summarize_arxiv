    "the current cosmological paradigm , the @xmath7cdm universe , has successfully explained the overall assembly of cosmic structures @xcite . in this picture ordinary matter ( `` baryons '' ) , which emits and absorbs light , passively follows the evolution of the dark matter . this should be corrected , if we want to make a realistic theory of galaxy formation .",
    "it is necessary to include the physics of the gas and galaxy formation into the @xmath7cdm paradigm , because , after all , many observational evidences of cosmic structures come from the light emitted by galaxies .    galaxy formation is driven by a complex set of physical processes with very different spatial scales .",
    "radiative cooling , star formation and supernova explosions happen at scales less than 1  pc , but they affect the formation of a whole galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition , large - scale cosmological processes , such as gas accretion through cosmic filaments , and galaxy mergers , control the galaxy assembly . as a result ,",
    "a complex interplay between very different processes drives the formation of galaxies .",
    "cosmological gasdynamical simulations have become useful tools to study galaxy formation .    in early cosmological simulations",
    "`` galaxies '' formed with too small disks and a significant fraction of angular momentum was lost @xcite .",
    "the situation has improved in the last years .",
    "@xcite show that a sub - kpc resolution is necessary to prevent an artificial loss of angular momentum .",
    "recent improvements in both the resolution and modeling of the feedback have resulted in simulations with extended galactic disks @xcite .",
    "however , simulated galaxies are still too concentrated , and more realistic simulations with better resolution and better physics are needed to reproduce the shape of the rotation curves of observed galaxies .",
    "current simulations lack the necessary resolution to follow correctly the effect of supernova explosions in the ism . because of this lack of resolution ,",
    "the modeling of stellar feedback has relied on ad - hoc assumptions about the effect of stellar feedback at scales unresolved by simulations ( 0.2 - 1 kpc ) .",
    "early attempts to introduce stellar feedback into simulations found the obstacle of a strong radiative cooling .",
    "the energy deposited by supernova explosions was quickly radiated away without any effect in the ism @xcite .",
    "several shortcuts have been proposed to get around this over - cooling problem .",
    "the most common method is to artificially stop cooling when the stellar energy is deposited @xcite this approach prolongs the adiabatic phase of supernova explosion ( the sedov solution ) to about 30 myr .",
    "the motivation behind this ad - hoc assumption is that the combination of blastwaves from different supernova explosions and turbulent motions produces hot bubbles much larger than individual supernova remnants and last longer .",
    "all this effects are not resolved with the current resolution .",
    "they do not develop in a self - consistent way .",
    "instead , the delay in the cooling is introduced by hand .",
    "the problem is that other effects can be missed at the same time due to a lack of resolution and an inaccurate modeling of feedback .",
    "another method is to introduce a sub - resolution model in which the energy from supernova explosions is stored in an unresolved hot phase , which does not cool and looses energy through the evaporation of cold clouds @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the only effect of stellar feedback is to regulate the star formation : the hot gas is coupled with the cold phase through cloud formation and evaporation . as a result , this high entropy gas is artificially trapped within the galactic disk .",
    "thus , galactic winds are introduced in a simplified way in order to reproduce other natural effects of stellar feedback , such as galactic outflows .",
    "an alternative approach assumes kinetic feedback instead of thermal feedback @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the energy from supernova explosions or stellar winds is transfered to the kinetic energy of the surrounding medium .",
    "this energy is not dissipated directly by radiative cooling . however , in order to resolve this effect accurately , simulations should be able to resolve the expansion of individual supernova explosions or the stellar winds from individual stars .",
    "currently , this is not possible . at larger scales ,",
    "the picture is more complicated .",
    "different blastwaves from different supernova explosions can collide , dissipating their kinetic energy .",
    "the same dissipation of energy happens in collisions of stellar winds in stellar clusters .",
    "so , it is commonly assumed that most of the kinetic energy from stellar feedback is dissipated into thermal energy at the smallest scales resolved by simulations .",
    "nevertheless , this feedback - heated gas can expand . as a result",
    ", thermal energy can be transfered to kinetic energy .",
    "the net results are flows at large scales powered by the thermal feedback .",
    "however , feedback heating should dominates over radiative cooling : only in this case those flows are produced .",
    "to summarize , the main problems of current simulations of galaxy formation are the lack of the necessary resolution and too simplified models of the complex hydrodynamic processes in the multiphase ism .",
    "the galactic ism has a very wide range of densities and temperatures ( for review see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "three distinct phases are distinguished : the dense cold gas ( giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) , cold hi gas or diffuse clouds ) with densities above 10 @xmath1 and temperatures bellow 100 k , the warm component with densities between 0.1 and 1 @xmath1 and temperatures of several thousands degrees , and the hot phase with temperatures above @xmath8 k and densities bellow @xmath9 @xmath1 .",
    "this multiphase medium is set by the competition of cooling and heating mechanism and the onset of thermal instabilities .",
    "the hot ism component @xmath10 k ) is usually associated with gas heated by shocks .",
    "they can be produced by turbulent motions driven by gravitational and thermal instabilities .",
    "however , these turbulent driven shocks can only heat the gas up to @xmath11  k @xcite .",
    "only supernova explosions and stellar winds can produce larger gas temperatures @xcite .",
    "2d and 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the ism have enough resolution ( parsecs ) to resolve the multi - phase nature of the ism and to explore complicated effects of stellar feedback on different scales @xcite .",
    "there is much to learn from these simulations .",
    "however , they typically focus on conditions in the solar neighborhood , which are different from what one may expect during early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "not always they follow the whole gas cycle : cooling , star formation , and stellar feedback .",
    "for example , @xcite include star formation but artificially restrict the rate of supernova explosions around a fixed value",
    ". however , this rate could be much higher in large star forming regions . as a result",
    ", the effect of stellar feedback is underestimated in these regions .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of the stellar feedback in the ism , such as the formation of hot bubbles and super - bubbles is resolved .",
    "it is crucial to understand where and how the energy from massive stars is released back to the ism .",
    "while a large fraction of massive stars are found in stellar clusters and ob associations , 10 - 30% are found in the field , away from any molecular cloud or stellar cluster @xcite .",
    "this population have peculiar kinematics .",
    "their velocity dispersion is about 30  km  s@xmath3 , much higher than the velocity dispersion of the population of massive stars in clusters ( 10 km s@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "some of these stars have large peculiar velocities , up to 200 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is why they are called runaway stars .",
    "the current scenario of the origin of runaway stars is the ejection of these massive stars from stellar clusters .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms of this ejection .",
    "one possibility is the ejection due to a supernova explosion in a close binary system @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is the ejection due to dynamical encounters in the crowded regions of stellar clusters @xcite . in spite of the fact that a significant fraction of the stellar feedback occurs far from star forming regions ,",
    "no attention has been paid to its effect on the galaxy formation .",
    "we first study the effect of stellar feedback in the ism , using simulations of a kpc - scale piece of the ism with few parsecs resolution .",
    "then , we check if this picture holds when the resolution is degraded to the resolution that our cosmological simulations can achieve at high redshift .",
    "finally , we study the effect of stellar feedback in galaxy formation at high redshift using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the necessary conditions in which stellar feedback dominates over radiative cooling .",
    "section 3 describes all details of the modeling of stellar feedback .",
    "section 4 shows kpc - scale simulations of the ism .",
    "section 5 describes the cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "finally , section 6 is the discussion and conclusion . throughout the paper we give quantities in physical units .",
    "the thermodynamical state of the gas depends on two competing processes : heating from stellar feedback and cooling from radiative processes .",
    "they appear as source and sink terms of internal energy in the equation of the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the internal energy per unit volume , @xmath14 is the pressure of the gas , and * v * is its velocity .",
    "parameter @xmath15 is the heating rate due to stellar feedback , and @xmath7 is the net cooling rate from radiative processes .    the heating rate from stellar feedback can be expressed as the rate of energy losses from a young and active single stellar population with a given density , @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the specific rate of energy losses of the stellar population according to its age .",
    "the cooling rate can be expressed as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hydrogen number density .",
    "now , we can ask ourselves under which conditions the feedback heating dominates over the radiative looses . using the expression , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gas density",
    ", @xmath23 is the molecular weight per hydrogen atom and @xmath24 is the hydrogen mass , the condition for heating @xmath25 can be expressed as : @xmath26 using typical values , we can rewrite the condition for the heating regime in the following way : @xmath27 @xmath28 the cooling rate , @xmath29 is a strong function of gas temperature .",
    "so , the temperature and the density of the gas are two key properties in establishing the cooling or the heating regimes .",
    "the following two examples illustrate common situations .    at temperatures around @xmath30",
    "k , the cooling rate is close to its maximum value .",
    "we use @xmath31 erg s@xmath3 @xmath32 as a fiducial value . in this case eq.([eq:4b ] ) shows that the heating overcomes the cooling only at very low densities @xmath33 @xmath34 optimistically assuming that the ratio of densities , @xmath35 is about unity . as a result , stellar feedback is not able to heat the gas beyond @xmath30 k for densities higher than 0.1  @xmath36 and typical values of @xmath37 this is the well known overcooling problem for simulations , which allow cooling only to a temperature of @xmath30  k at which the star formation is assumed to happen . the energy from stellar feedback is radiated away very efficiently and the thermal feedback can not play any role",
    ". in this case one needs to invoke `` subgrid physics ''  a guess how the system should react to the energy released by the stars .",
    "the situation is completely different if the gas is allowed to cool to 100 k. the cooling is very inefficient at that temperature : @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 @xmath32 .",
    "so , stellar feedback can produce the net gas heating even if the density is large : @xmath39 @xmath36 for @xmath40 .",
    "our conclusion is that simulations should include cooling process bellow @xmath30 k. the cold phase should be resolved in order to get a high efficiency of stellar feedback .",
    "however , heating to high temperatures is still problematic because as the gas is heated , the cooling rate increases .",
    "so , the peak of the cooling rate at @xmath30  k is a bottle - neck for heating gas to higher temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , temperatures of diffuse gas as high as @xmath41  k have been observed around star - forming regions such as the rosette nebulae @xcite , m17 @xcite , and the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "the main question is how young and massive stars can heat their surrounding medium to these high temperatures , if the original medium , in which they were born had high densities .",
    "the answer likely depends on the distance from those young stellar clusters . at small 1 - 2  pc distances",
    "it is likely to have the collisions of stellar winds @xcite . at larger distances",
    "the heating is related with the formation of superbubbles : the cumulative effect of winds and shocks generated by many young stars .",
    "one way or another , the density of gas around the young stellar population decreases and the ratio @xmath35 increases as the over - pressured bubble of gas expands .",
    "once the density goes below @xmath42 @xmath36 , eq.([eq:4b ] ) can be fulfilled even at @xmath30 k. the net result is a heating regime , in which the surrounding gas can be heated to very high temperatures . in other words ,",
    "the process starts with the expanding bubbles at low temperatures and then proceeds to a runaway overheating regime .    as an example",
    ", we consider a typical gmc with a mass of @xmath8  @xmath43   and a size of 50  pc .",
    "these are the typical values found in recent catalogs of gmcs in m33 @xcite , m31 and the milky way @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mean density is @xmath44 @xmath36 .",
    "this value seems low compared with typical observed densities of molecular clouds .",
    "however , gmcs are highly clumpy .",
    "high - density clumps are usually embedded in a low density inter - clump medium . as a result ,",
    "the volume - averaged density inside clouds is much smaller than the typical observed mass - weighted density @xcite .",
    "now , we consider an orion - like stellar cluster formed at the center of the cloud .",
    "the mass of the stellar cluster is @xmath45 @xcite . in a region of mass @xmath30",
    "@xmath43 , the stellar cluster has the ratio @xmath46 equal to 0.5 , and the condition for heating , eq.([eq:4b ] ) , is fulfilled .",
    "this heating produces an over - pressured hot bubble with a pressure 100 times higher than the surrounding unperturbed medium . as a result ,",
    "the bubble expands , the density decreases , and the ratio @xmath35 increases .",
    "then , we get a runaway bubble , which proceeds to blowing away all gas @xcite .",
    "simulations should resolve the expansion of bubbles over - pressured by stellar feedback .",
    "the density of young ( and active ) stars and the density of gas should be comparable at the smallest scales resolved by the simulations .",
    "the minimum value of the ratio @xmath47 depends on the gas density ( eq .  [ eq:4b ] ) .",
    "for moderate gas densities , @xmath48 @xmath34 the above ratio should be around 0.1 - 1 .",
    "the above condition can be achieved if the star formation efficiency , the fraction of the progenitor cloud consumed in stars is 10%-50% at the resolution scale .",
    "this high efficiency is consistent with the observed value of 10%-40% found in galactic stellar clusters , @xcite . due to the fact that 80% of the galactic star formation occurs in stellar clusters @xcite",
    ", this high efficiency of star formation should be considered in any star formation model which can resolve the sites where star formation occurs .      as we saw in the previous section , low densities",
    "are required in order to heat the gas beyond the peak of the cooling curve .",
    "stellar feedback should evacuate the gas by creating an expanding bubble around young stellar clusters .",
    "however , the over - pressured bubble expands only if the pressure gradient overcomes self - gravity .",
    "if we consider an over - pressured bubble of radius @xmath49 in a homogeneous medium of density @xmath50 , we can derive a jeans - instability type of condition . as a result",
    ", the bubble expands only if the difference in pressure with its surroundings , @xmath51 , satisfies the following relationship : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath54 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath55 is the radius in pc .",
    "the above equation sets the conditions for the bubble expansion . for the galactic plane",
    "the pressure is @xmath56 @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "for example , a region of 50  pc in radius and a density of 100  @xmath36 will only expand , if the difference in pressure is bigger than @xmath58 @xmath36  k. this can be achieved , if the bubble is over - pressured by more than 100 times .",
    "stellar feedback can produce this overpressure just by raising the temperature from 100  k to @xmath30  k. the resulted over - pressured region will expand , and the density as well as the cooling rate will decrease .",
    "so , the efficiency of stellar feedback increases , raising the temperature and pressure further .",
    "[ eq:5 ] also sets a upper limit on the resolution . using the equation of state of the ideal gas @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mean number density and t is the temperature of the gas ,",
    "the over - pressured bubble should be resolved with a spatial resolution @xmath61 , such that the expansion is resolved : @xmath62 as a result , for typical values of these over - pressured regions , the resolution should be better than @xmath63 70 pc .",
    "otherwise , the bubble can not overcome its self - gravity and can not expand .",
    "we assume a model of thermal feedback for the injection of energy from stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "the kinetic energy from these processes is efficiently dissipated into thermal energy due to shocks at scales bellow the spatial resolution .",
    "the net thermal rate @xmath64 is used to update the internal energy in each step of the simulation .",
    "this approach is rather different than the deposition of energy . instead",
    ", the energy injection from stellar feedback is treated in a self - consistent way along with the radiative looses .",
    "the heating rate from stellar feedback in a given volume element is modeled as the rate of energy losses from a set of single stellar populations present in that volume .",
    "this is just a generalization of eq.([eq:2 ] ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the mass and the age of each single stellar population .",
    "the modeling of the specific release of energy over time , @xmath68 is motivated by the results from population synthesis codes , such as starburst99 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows different models of @xmath18 and the results of a starburst99 computation with a miller - scalo imf from 0.1  @xmath43   to 100  @xmath43 .",
    "parameter @xmath18 is dominated by stellar winds from massive ob main - sequence stars and wr stars during the first few myr .",
    "later the energy is produced by core - collapse supernovae from stars more massive than 8  @xmath43 .",
    "after 40  myr , the release of energy comes from stellar winds of agb stars and other less powerful sources , and the injection rate drops 6 orders of magnitudes .",
    "supernovae ia dominate the feedback at much longer time - scales .",
    "we assume a peak of the snia rate at 1  gyr .",
    "however , this peak is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the contribution from core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this is because the energy from a population of snia is diluted over a much longer time scale than the energy from core - collapse supernovae .",
    "we model @xmath18 with a constant rate of 1.18 @xmath6910@xmath70 erg s@xmath71 over 40  myr .",
    "this is equivalent to the injection of @xmath72  erg of energy from stellar winds and supernova explosions per each massive star with @xmath73  @xmath43   during its lifetime .",
    "we assume a miller - scalo imf in the mass range @xmath74  @xmath43 .",
    "note that this constant heating rate is the sum of the contributions from all massive stars in a single stellar population .",
    "we also consider a more simple model , which we call a sn model . in this case @xmath75",
    "ergs is injected at constant rate due to stellar winds over 10 or 40  myr .",
    "then it follows a strong peak of energy release due to the supernova explosion , in which @xmath75  erg are released during @xmath8  yrs  the typical age of young supernova remnants .",
    "although the total energy released is the same in both models , the sn model takes into account the explosive nature of core - collapse supernovae .      the effect of runaway stars is implemented by adding a random velocity to a fraction of stellar particles ( 10%-30% ) .",
    "this extra velocity has a random orientation and the value is taken from an exponential distribution with a characteristic scale of 17 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this choice is motivated by hipparcos data @xcite and monte - carlo simulations @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "a gaussian distribution is also used @xcite . however , the effect of runaway stars in the ism is not very sensitive to the details of this velocity distribution .",
    "radiative cooling counterbalances feedback heating .",
    "so it is very important to have an accurate model of radiative cooling in order to study the net effect of stellar feedback in the ism .",
    "we use the model of radiative cooling described in @xcite .",
    "it is a metallicity - dependent cooling plus a uv heating due to a cosmological ionizing background @xcite .",
    "the model includes compton heating / cooling and molecular cooling .",
    "the temperature range of the model is between @xmath76 k @xmath77 k. thus , this model includes cooling below @xmath30 k and the gas can reach the thermodynamical conditions of molecular clouds . as we saw in section 2 , this is crucial for the efficiency of the stellar feedback .    the cooling and heating rates from radiative processes are tabulated using the cloudy code ( version 96b4 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) . as a result ,",
    "the net cooling rate from radiative processes , @xmath29 is available for a given density , temperature , metallicity and redshift .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed using the eulerian gasdynamics + n - body adaptive refinement tree code @xcite .",
    "the physical processes of the gas include star formation , stellar feedback , metal enrichment , self - consistent advection of metals , cooling and heating rates from metallicity - dependent cooling and uv heating due to a cosmological ionizing background .",
    "our first step in the understanding of stellar feedback in galaxies is to understand its effect in the ism at galactic scales .",
    "therefore , we run simulations of a @xmath78 kpc@xmath79 piece of a galactic disk with 8 - 16 pc resolution .",
    "these simulations fully resolve the effect of massive stars at galactic scales .",
    "so , resolution is not longer an issue .    we can use this ism - scale simulation as a benchmark for the effect of stellar feedback at galactic scales",
    "then , we can degrade the resolution to see which model of feedback reproduces the same overall picture at lower resolution .",
    "these simulations can then be used as testing grounds for these models at different resolutions .",
    "they tell us what are the necessary ingredients to reproduce the truly effect of stellar feedback at the resolution that we can afford in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "we want to see the effect of stellar feedback in the typical conditions of normal disk galaxies with moderate gas surface densities .",
    "so , we are not modeling starburst galaxies with large amounts of gas and high star formation rates .",
    "this type of study will be done in the future .",
    "a 4 kpc box of ism represents a significant piece of a galactic disk .",
    "the simulation resolves the dense galactic plane , where molecular clouds are formed .",
    "this is important to follow star formation correctly . at the same time",
    ", the simulation follows the gas at few kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "this height is similar to the scale - height of the diffuse warm phase of the ism ( cox 2005 ) .",
    "the simulation includes radiative cooling and uv heating from a uniform uv field at redshift 0 as described in section 3 .",
    "star formation happens in the highest density peaks with a density threshold of 100  @xmath36 . in each star formation event",
    ", 5  % of the mass in gas inside a volume element is converted into a stellar particle with a mass of 88  @xmath43within a time - step set by the courant condition ( @xmath63 2 @xmath6910@xmath80 yr ) .",
    "the supernova model was used for stellar feedback and snia was not included .",
    "the metallicity was assumed solar and constant throughout the simulation .",
    "the initial distribution of gas density is uniform in the @xmath81 and @xmath82 directions of the box . in the @xmath83-direction ,",
    "the density profile declines at both sides of the middle plane , @xmath84 kpc .",
    "this plane defines the galactic plane for this ism model : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the gas density in that plane and @xmath87 is the scale - height .",
    "the choice of parameters sets the conditions of a quiescent normal galactic disk , @xmath88 @xmath36 and @xmath89 pc .",
    "thus , the surface density is @xmath90 @xmath91 pc@xmath92 the system is originally in hydrostatic equilibrium with a temperature of @xmath30 k. no stars are present at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the box has open boundaries in the z - direction .",
    "so , all material that cross these boundaries escapes the system .",
    "the initial velocity field consists of a sum of plane - parallel velocity waves : @xmath93 the amplitudes are taken from a gaussian field with a tilted power spectrum , @xmath94 where k is the wavenumber , @xmath95 i , j and k are integers running from -20 to 20 ( excluding 0 ) and @xmath96 km",
    "s@xmath5 this is a typical spectrum of a compressible turbulent medium @xcite .",
    "@xmath97 @xmath98 is a random number taken from a gaussian distribution .      at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the gas starts to move according to the turbulent velocity field . as a result , the gas accumulates where different flows converge and molecular clouds @xmath36 and @xmath99 naturally appear in form of filaments and shells .",
    "however , around 90% of the volume is filled with warm and diffuse gas heated by uv background .",
    "star formation occurs in the cores of the cold phase .",
    "newly formed massive stars inject energy and a cavity filled with hot and very diffuse gas is formed .",
    "this over - pressured material expands and the net result is the formation of super - bubbles .",
    "this hot gas can not stay in the plane of the disk , as a result , the bubble expands faster in the direction perpendicular to the disk , because the density declines in that direction .",
    "the bubble develops into a galactic chimney @xcite .",
    "the chimney outflow does not look as a homogeneous , coherent flow .",
    "instead , the chimney is turbulent and has dense and cold clumps embedded into the flow .",
    "eventually , the gas expands in the halo and cools ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "another interesting feature seen in this model is a population of isolated bubbles in the warm medium .",
    "these are the results of individual supernova explosions of runaway stars      after an initial burst of star formation , the star formation rate is nearly constant for the rest of the evolution ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we found a low star formation rate surface density , @xmath100 temporally averaged over a period of @xmath101 yr ( 100 time - steps ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the expected value from the correlation between the star formation rate surface density and the gas surface density found in nearby galaxies @xcite . for a gas surface density of @xmath102 @xmath103 at t=90 myr ,",
    "the expected value from the @xcite fit is @xmath104 this is very close to our results .    as observers usually do",
    ", we also calculate the gas consumption time - scale , @xmath105 m@xmath106/sfr , in the simulated molecular clouds , assuming that gas with a density higher than 30 @xmath36 is mainly within gmcs . in our simulations , the amount of gas in molecular clouds is m@xmath106= 8 @xmath69 @xmath11 @xmath91 at t=90 myr .",
    "the star formation rate at that time is @xmath107 . as a result ,",
    "the gas consumption time - scale in the simulated clouds is @xmath108 170 myr .",
    "this is quite long compared with the typical free - fall time - scale inside molecular clouds , t@xmath109 myr for @xmath110 100 @xmath111    in our simulations , the star formation efficiency over a free - fall time - scale , the fraction of gas consumed in stars during a free - fall time - scale , is only 2.5% .",
    "this value is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a range of 0.6%-2.6% for the whole population of gmcs of the milky - way .",
    "our value is also consistent with an efficiency of @xmath63 3% found in simulations of gmcs @xcite .",
    "finally , our results also agree with the model of a turbulent - dominated gmc , described in @xcite .",
    "they give an efficiency per free - fall time - scale of 1.5%-3% for typical values of their model .",
    "after 100 myr , only 10% of the gas in the simulation has been converted into stars .",
    "our simulations still have plenty of cold ( @xmath112 k ) gas after 100 myr .",
    "the surface density of this cold gas is @xmath113 @xmath103 .",
    "this value agrees with the surface density of molecular and atomic hydrogen of @xmath114 @xmath103 found at the solar radius @xcite .",
    "however , the surface density of molecular gas is low , @xmath115 @xmath103 , compared with the observed value of @xmath116 @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "this partially explains why our star formation efficiency over a free - fall time - scale is in the higher end of the observed range .    to conclude ,",
    "stellar feedback is able to regulate star formation on galactic scales because it regulates the amount of gas available for star formation .",
    "stellar feedback heats and disperses the cold and dense gas after a star formation event . in a single star formation event , a stellar particle of @xmath63 90 @xmath91 is created .",
    "this roughly means the formation of a single high - mass star embedded in a small stellar cluster . due to the resolution",
    "limit , our simulation can not follow the details of the star formation process bellow @xmath63 10 pc scales , only the overall net effect .",
    "this effect is the formation of a small stellar cluster with an efficiency of 5% . as we pointed in  2.1 ,",
    "the star formation efficiency of galactic stellar clusters is high , regardless the details of their formation .",
    "however , although the star formation efficiency is high , subsequent feedback processes produce a low average star formation .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] also shows that the net effect of stellar feedback is to produce the hot phase of the ism .",
    "after the initial strong burst of star formation , this phase can cover up to 80% of the total volume .",
    "this represents almost the entire volume above a height of 400 pc from the galactic plane .",
    "however , pockets of warm gas are embedded in this hot flow even at 2 kpc away from the plane .",
    "it has the same inhomogeneous structure seen in the galactic fountain of figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "after 100 myr , @xmath117% of the gas is able to scape the computational volume .",
    "most of the hot gas is lost or cooled down after 100 myr . as a result ,",
    "the volume of hot gas decreases because the star formation is low and the injection of energy is lower than in the initial burst .",
    "the simulation settles into a more quiescent regime in which the volume occupied by the warm and hot phases oscillates in a self - regulated gas cycle . in this cycle ,",
    "bursts of star formation ( much smaller than the initial one ) produce super - bubbles and galactic chimneys of hot gas .",
    "therefore , the volume of hot gas increases .",
    "as the star formation fades , the bubbles cool down and the fraction of hot gas decreases until the next stellar burst .",
    "this pattern reflects the star formation history .",
    "the particular fraction of hot and warm phases at any moment does depend to the particular star formation history of 10 - 40 myr before that moment .",
    "the latter stages of the simulation offer a more representative view of the ism .",
    "the effect of the initial conditions is gone .",
    "therefore , we can study the characteristics of this feedback - driven ism .",
    "we select a snapshot at 113 myr , after the second burst of star formation . at that moment",
    ", the warm phase covers @xmath118 of the volume and the hot phase filled @xmath119 x - ray emitting gas with temperatures above @xmath120 k occupies @xmath121 of the volume inside a height of 250 pc above the galactic plane .",
    "this is roughly consistent with ism simulations with a 1-pc resolution @xcite , galactic ism models and observations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows representative slices of the box .",
    "the medium is very inhomogeneous at different scales .",
    "large bubbles of low density coexist with long filamentary structures of dense clouds .",
    "overall , the medium covers more than 6 orders of magnitude in density and temperature . the cold phase forms dense and cold clouds near the galactic plane .",
    "the warm phase fills old cooled bubbles and low - density clouds .",
    "finally , the hot phase is present in form of hot bubbles of few hundred pc wide and kpc - scale chimneys .",
    "the gas in these chimneys is flowing away from the plane with velocities exceeding @xmath122 km s@xmath5 these bubbles even break the dense plane in hot spots surrounded by cold and dense shells .",
    "all this phenomenology associated with the hot phase is driven by stellar feedback . as a result ,",
    "one effect of the stellar feedback is to sustain a three - phase ism .",
    "the distribution of temperature clearly shows the three main peaks of the three phases of the ism ( figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the two local minima correspond to thermally unstable gas .",
    "the minimum around @xmath123 k , between the peaks of the cold and warm phases , is produced by the competition of uv heating and radiative cooling .",
    "this corresponds to the unstable regime of the classical two - phase model of the ism in thermal equilibrium ( cox 2005 ) .",
    "the dip between @xmath30 and @xmath8 k results from the peak of the cooling curve .",
    "the gas cools very fast at these temperatures . as a result",
    ", it usually appears at the interface between hot and warm gas . as an exception ,",
    "old bubbles at these temperatures are present in the simulation with very low densities and far away from the plane .",
    "so , their cooling time is very long .",
    "this temperature distribution supports the temperature cuts used throughout the paper to distinguish the three phases : @xmath123 k for the cut between cold and warm phases and @xmath30 for the warm - hot cut . to summarize",
    ", this model of the ism reproduces the main properties of the temperature distribution of the ism ( cox 2005 ) and predicts that gas with very high temperatures @xmath124  k exists in the cores of galactic chimneys .",
    "this gas occupies only 5 % of the total volume and have a very small surface density of 4 @xmath6910@xmath125 pc@xmath92    these three phases of the ism are also clearly visible in the density distribution ( figure [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "we use the temperature cuts defined before to see the contribution of the different phases .",
    "thus , the hot phase dominates the low - density range , bellow @xmath126 @xmath111 the warm phase covers intermediate densities , and the cold phase dominates the high density tail above 1 @xmath111 the density distribution of any of the three phases can not be described by a single lognormal distribution , as claimed in wada & norman ( 2001 ) . instead",
    ", a combination of several lognormal distributions may give a better approximation @xcite .",
    "the distribution of velocities ( figure [ fig:7 ] ) shows two distinct features .",
    "the warm phase contribute to a strong peak around 30 km s@xmath5 the hot phase dominates the high velocity tail .",
    "it has velocities as higher as 2000 km s@xmath5 the gas with velocities in this tail can easily escape the system .",
    "this gas forms hot outflows and galactic chimneys .",
    "finally , figure [ fig:8 ] shows the distribution of the mach number , = u / c , where u is the gas velocity and c is the sound speed .",
    "the distribution shows that 80% of the volume has supersonic motions .",
    "almost all the warm phase , half of the hot phase and all the cold phase are supersonic flows .",
    "the subsonic range is dominated by the hot phase , in conclusion , the ism can hold high supersonic motions , driven by stellar feedback .",
    "the resolution in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation is much lower than the simulations of the ism presented before .",
    "so , we can wonder if this picture of stellar feedback can hold if the resolution is degraded .",
    "therefore , the same ism models have been performed with high resolution ( 14 pc ) and with low resolution ( 60 pc ) .",
    "the fraction of volume filled with each gas phase is used as a proxy to check the global effect of stellar feedback in the ism ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "left panels show that the hot phase covers a significant volume .    at low resolution and without runaway stars ( top right panel ) ,",
    "the hot gas is almost absent from the simulation .",
    "small filaments are not resolved and the subsequent star formation is suppressed in these areas which can be easily broken by stellar feedback . as a result , star formation is concentrated at the center of big clumps of gas .",
    "stars inject energy in high density regions , so this energy is radiated away without any thermodynamical effect in the medium .",
    "however , if the model of runaway stars is included , the hot phase is recovered at low resolution .",
    "stars can now migrate away from high density regions , so the injection of energy is more efficient in forming hot gas . as a result , the model with runaway stars can reproduce the effect of stellar feedback even at a resolution of 60 pc .      as a example of the conditions of the overheating regime discussed in section 2 , we can ask now how a hot bubble develops in the first place .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:10 ] shows the physical conditions of a single volume element over 10 myr .",
    "this volume develops a hot and dilute medium starting from a cold and dense phase .",
    "the gradients are computed using a 3-points finite differences expression using the adjacent cells .    at the beginning",
    ", there are no stars present inside that volume .",
    "so , there is no feedback heating . at the same time",
    ", the density is high enough so the the radiative cooling dominates over the uv background heating . as a result , the medium stays at the floor temperature of 300 k. the medium is also in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the situation drastically changes when young stars appear .",
    "they are not born inside that particular volume .",
    "instead , they are drifting slowly from adjacent cells .",
    "the result is that this young population injects energy into the medium .",
    "so , heating dominates over cooling initially .",
    "the system responds by increasing the temperature . as a result , the cooling rate increases and the medium reaches a balance between cooling and heating rates in a very short time - scale",
    "this is because the cooling time is very short in those conditions .",
    "the net result is a medium slightly hotter than surroundings so this over - pressured region expands and the density inside that volume decreases .    around @xmath30",
    "k , the cooling curve is a very steep function of temperature , so the temperature increases very slowly .",
    "but , at the same time , the density drops faster . as a result , the cooling rate decreases .",
    "this expansion is fueled by a roughly constant injection of energy from massive stars .    when the conditions of eq .",
    "[ eq:4b ] are fulfilled , the medium can pass through the peak of the cooling curve , somewhere between @xmath127 k. after that , the gas has low density and a temperature of few millions degrees . as a result",
    ", heating dominates over cooling and a hot cavity is formed .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig:10 ] shows a different situation . the volume is selected to be the high - density core of a molecular cloud formed in the low - resolution run shown in the top - right panel of figure [ fig:9 ] .",
    "stellar feedback from the stars formed in that core are able to heat the gas only to @xmath30 k. the gradients of pressure do not overcome gravity .",
    "the condition of bubble expansion is not fulfilled , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5b ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the density remains high and a hot bubble can not develop .",
    "in previous sections , we have shown that our models of stellar feedback follow the effect of supernova explosions and stellar winds in the ism with a resolution of about 50 pc .",
    "the result is the formation of super - bubbles and galactic chimneys .",

    "the density and temperature thresholds used are @xmath178 @xmath91 pc@xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 k. in spite of the fact that we allow star formation starting at @xmath183 k , in practice the vast majority ( @xmath184 ) of `` stars '' form at temperatures below 1000  k and more than half of the stars form bellow 300 k and densities larger than 10 @xmath111    as described in  2.1 , the ratio @xmath35 should be @xmath63 0.1 - 0.5 for typical conditions of dense , star - forming gas . only in this case thermal feedback can produce over - pressured hot bubbles in the sites of star formation ( eq . [ eq:4b ] ) . based on equation [ eq : sf ] , this ratio of densities can be expressed as @xmath185 as a result , thermal feedback is only efficient in dense , cold , star - forming gas if @xmath186 this sets the value of @xmath134 , because @xmath169 is set by the conditions of hydrodynamics , as explained before : @xmath187 myr . therefore , the value of @xmath134 should be in the range 2 - 20 myr , consistent with the gas consumption time - scales during the formation of galactic stellar clusters @xcite . however , this high local efficiency of star formation in high - density regions produces the observed low global efficiency , @xmath188 gyr , as discussed in  4.3 .",

    "<S> although supernova explosions and stellar winds happen at very small scales , they affect the interstellar medium ( ism ) at galactic scales and regulate the formation of a whole galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts of mimicking these effects in simulations of galaxy formation use very simplified assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a much more realistic prescription for modeling the feedback , which minimizes any ad hoc sub - grid physics . </S>",
    "<S> we start with developing high resolution models of the ism and formulate the conditions required for its realistic functionality : formation of multi - phase medium with hot chimneys , super - bubbles , cold molecular phase , and very slow consumption of gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this can be achieved only by doing what the real universe does : formation of dense ( @xmath0 h atoms @xmath1 ) , cold ( @xmath2 k ) molecular phase , where the star formation happens , and which is disrupted by young stars . </S>",
    "<S> another important ingredient is the runaway stars : massive binary stars ejected from molecular clouds when one of the companions becomes a supernova . </S>",
    "<S> those stars can move to 10 - 100 parsecs away from molecular clouds before exploding themselves as supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> this greatly facilitates the feedback . </S>",
    "<S> once those effects are implemented into cosmological simulations , galaxy formation proceeds more realistically . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we do not have the overcooling problem . </S>",
    "<S> the angular momentum problem ( resulting in a too massive bulge ) is also reduced substantially : the rotation curves are nearly flat . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy formation also becomes more violent . just as often observed in qso absorption lines , </S>",
    "<S> there are substantial outflows from forming and active galaxies . at high redshifts </S>",
    "<S> we routinely find gas with few hundred km s@xmath3 and occasionally @xmath4 km s@xmath5 the gas has high metallicity , which may exceed the solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the gas in the outflows and in chimneys can be very high : @xmath6 k. the density profile of dark matter is still consistent with a cuspy profile . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution is very high : better than 50 pc , which is 10 times better than the typical resolution in previous cosmological simulations . our simulations of galaxy formation reach the resolution of 35 pc . </S>"
