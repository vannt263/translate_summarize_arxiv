    "it has been proposed that the massive electronic state manages to appear due to either ( 1 ) the frustrated ( for nearest neighbors ) fcc crystal structure suppressing long range order to below the kondo temperature or ( 2 ) the low carrier density , metallic nature leading to an unusually low kondo temperature @xcite , or both .",

    "the observed behavior of k - w ratio suggests that the variation of @xmath202 values is due to magnetic field induced changes in @xmath203 , a supposition that seems plausible because the ground state cef degeneracy in zero field can be lifted by applied magnetic field .",
    "however there are several points about k - w scaling and ybptbi that need to be considered .",
    "first , in zero field the ground state degeneracy of ybptbi should be @xmath203 = 2 ( doublet ) or @xmath203 = 4 ( quartet ) in cubic cef @xcite . based on this",
    "we would expect @xmath203 = 4 at most , not 6 or 8 .",
    "second , the k - w ratio not only depends on the degeneracy but also on the carrier concentration , @xmath19 , as @xmath204 @xcite , which is an important correction in low carrier density systems . thus , it is necessary to consider the carrier density for lower carrier systems .",
    "although a single band model will ultimately be inadequate for ybptbi , it does provide a useful starting point ; when the carrier density , 0.04 hole per formula unit ( in a single band model ) for ybptbi at 300k , is considered , the @xmath203 = 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 manifold shown in fig .",
    "[ ybptbikw1 ] ( a ) shifts downward with the @xmath203 = 2 line falling well below the data .",
    "thus the carrier concentration within a single band model can not explain the observed behavior of k - w ratio . for ybptbi the k - w ratio may depend on cef splitting , low carrier density , and details of the multiple fermi surfaces .",
    "the multiband nature of ybptbi is clearly evidenced from quantum oscillations @xcite ( the analysis of the quantum oscillation is beyond the scope of this paper ) and can be supported from the tep results .",
    "many metals , including hf compounds , have shown correlations between @xmath35 and @xmath162 in the zero temperature limit , linking these two quantities via the dimensionless ratio , @xmath2051 , where @xmath206 is the avogadro number and the constant @xmath207 is called the faraday number @xcite . at finite temperature , near 0.4k , this relation seems not to be relevant for ybptbi .",
    "taking the values of @xmath162 = 1.2 @xmath45v / k at the onset of @xmath14 and @xmath10 = 7.4 j / mol@xmath12k@xmath13 yields @xmath208 = 0.015 .",
    "since the dimensionless ratio holds for a single carrier per formula unit , generally a larger @xmath208 value is expected when the carrier density is as low as this is ; the carrier density of 0.04 hole per formula unit implies @xmath208 = -25 . therefore @xmath162",
    "@xmath4 -20@xmath45v / k@xmath13 is expected for @xmath10 = 7.4 j / mol@xmath12k@xmath13 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ ybptbist3 ] the absolute value of @xmath162 up to 8koe is considerably lower than this value , where @xmath10 remains the same order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the low carrier density of ybptbi can not , by itself , provide a natural explanation for this small magnitude of @xmath208 .",
    "this again points toward the multiband nature of this material as a likely explanation . in order to clearly address this issue ,",
    "further experimental investigations are required below 0.35k . in multiband metals ,",
    "the tep for each band can be positive or negative , therefore , in principle , the absolute value of the weighted sum of the overall tep could be considerably reduced , compared to the single band picture . when the same amount of entropy is carried by each type of carrier a reduction of @xmath162 is expected .",
    "therefore , in addition to the ground state degeneracy and carrier concentration , the multiband ( multi - fermi surface ) effect and/or the strong anisotropy of the fermi surfaces should be considered in the k - w ratio as well as the @xmath208 value .",
    "it is worth noting that a deviation from k - w relation and @xmath208-ratio has been observed in semi - metallic hf system cenisn and such a deviation has been qualitatively explained by considering carrier density @xcite .",
    "however , the low carrier density of ybptbi , on its own , can not explain the observed behaviors .",
