    "squeezed spin states ( sss )  @xcite , in which quantum uncertainty of the collective spin in a direction orthogonal to the mean spin vector is suppressed below the standard quantum limit , have recently been realized experimentally  @xcite . in the sss of atomic systems ,",
    "entanglement between atoms is crucial for suppressing fluctuations in collective atomic spin , and therefore such systems are of potential interest in quantum information processing as well as in atomic interferometry .",
    "a number of methods to generate sss in atomic systems have been proposed , and these can be classified into several categories .",
    "a few examples that are relevant to the subject of the present paper are : ( i ) squeezing is transferred between photons and atoms via their interactions  @xcite . using this property , sss can be realized in an atomic system by copying the squeezing from the system of photons to the atoms . this scheme has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) a probe laser beam propagating through atoms establishes entanglement between the atoms , with measurement of the probe laser inducing state reduction in the atomic states , resulting in sss  @xcite .",
    "this kind of measurement - induced - squeezing scheme has also been employed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the interaction between atoms and photons confined in a high - q cavity entangles them , and states of both atoms and photons develop into squeezed states  @xcite .    in the method ( iii )",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and by us  @xcite , photons prepared in a coherent state and atoms prepared in a coherent spin state undergo interactions in a high - q cavity , and after a certain interaction time sss is realized temporarily , but not in a steady state .",
    "precise control over the initial state and interaction time is therefore required . in the present paper , a novel scheme to generate sss",
    "is proposed that combines methods ( iii ) and ( ii ) to circumvent the stringent requirements of the precise control needed for method ( iii ) .",
    "sss is thus obtained as a `` quasi - steady state '' , regardless of the initial state , by performing continuous measurement of photons in the cavity .",
    "this drastically reduces experimental difficulties in producing sss .",
    "moreover , a degree of spin squeezing proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the number of atoms , can be achieved using this method , in contrast to the @xmath2 attainable by method ( iii )  @xcite .",
