    "a main challenge remains , namely how to increase the shift of the cavity resonance beyond one linewidth . to overcome this challenge one has to delicately choose all parameters that play a role in frequency shift of the cavity resonance that involves ; 1 ) the backbone and the frequency of light relative to the backbone s electronic bandgap , 2 ) the intensity of the light pulses , 3 ) the quality factor of the cavity , and 4 ) the duration of the switch pulse . in this work",

    "the reflected signal from the cavity is spectrally filtered with a spectrometer ( acton ) and detected with a nitrogen cooled ingaas line array detector ( princeton instruments ) . therefore , the observed spectrum , without amplification and conversion factors , is a fourier transform of @xmath51@xcite @xmath52 where c is the velocity of light in free space .",
    "the field escaping from a cavity whose resonance frequency shifts in time may exhibit new frequency components where the amplitude is higher than that of the incident bandwidth limited pulse . in this case , the ratio of the reflected pulse to the reference pulse , called the transient reflectivity @xmath53 exceeds unity at the new frequency components . in this sense ,",

    "the fluence of the pulses is determined from the average laser power at the sample position and converted to peak power assuming a gaussian pulse shape .",
    "the pump beam has a larger gaussian focus ( @xmath63 ) than the probe beam ( @xmath64 ) to ensure that only the central flat part of the pump focus is probed and that the probed region is spatially homogeneously pumped  @xcite .",
    "the induced resonance frequency shift with the electronic kerr effect is determined by the temporal(@xmath36 ) and the spatial overlap of the pump and the probe beams .",
    "for this reason , once we fix the spatial alignment of the pump and probe beams we successively perform switching of the different cavities to allow for the best possible comparison .",
    "the model that we employ to calculate the time - resolved transient reflectivity @xmath65 spectra has previously been described briefly in ref .",
