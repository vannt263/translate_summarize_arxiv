    "0.3 cm    hadronic decays of the @xmath1 lepton offer a unique laboratory for studying hadronic interactions at low energies ( below the @xmath1 lepton mass @xmath7 ) .",
    "proper modeling of such processes will facilitate comparison of experiment and theoretical models and may thus offer a crucial hint toward better understanding of low energy phenomenology of strong interactions . in this work we consider the @xmath1 decay into four pions and neutrino .",
    "several models of this decay are at present in use @xcite . while refs .",
    "@xcite make an attempt to construct the lagrangian of the decay from general theoretical principles , other models are purely phenomenological using either the experimental information from @xmath1 decays like in refs .",
    "@xcite or from @xmath8 annihilation like in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "let us concentrate on the latter approach .",
    "production of four pions is one of the dominant processes of @xmath9 annihilation into hadrons in the energy range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 gev .",
    "the hypothesis of the conserved vector current ( cvc ) relates to each other the cross section of this process and @xmath12 decay @xcite .",
    "therefore , all realistic models which describe the first process should also properly describe the other one .",
    "for a recent review of theoretical predictions for various decay modes of the @xmath1 based on cvc see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .    for more than five years , two new detectors cmd-2 @xcite and snd @xcite have been studying low energy @xmath9 annihilation at the @xmath9 collider vepp-2 m at novosibirsk .",
    "their results can be used to provide a new parameterization of the form factors used in the monte carlo generators of the @xmath1 lepton . in the present paper",
    "we define the form factors which can be used as one of the possibilities in tauola @xcite , the @xmath1 decay library .",
    "the tauola package is organized in such a way that the phase space generation and calculation of the electroweak part of the matrix element are separated from the part of the code calculating the hadronic current provided by the particular model .",
    "this is convenient not only for constructing the monte carlo program , but also facilitates comparisons between different models .",
    "the technical description of the solution which allows an easy replacement of different hadronic currents is described in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we recall basic principles of how @xmath8 data can be used in defining hadronic currents for the @xmath1 lepton decay . in section 3",
    "we describe those parts of the tauola monte carlo algorithm for four pion generation and general formalism for the semileptonic / semihadronic decays which are needed for the definition of hadronic currents . in section 4",
    "we describe the new current for the @xmath13 decay of the @xmath1 while in section 5 details of the functions and constants used in this work are presented .",
    "section 6 is devoted to technical tests of our code .",
    "section 7 shows the comparison of numerical results from running the new version of tauola with the relatively old one based on the cleo parameterization @xcite which is still widely in use despite the recent significant progress achieved by cleo @xcite .",
    "chapter 8 briefly summarizes the main results of the paper .    in appendices we describe some technical aspects of our model .",
    "in particular , we tabulate the functions @xmath14 used for the definition of the hadronic current .",
    "0.3 cm    via the hypothesis of conserved vector current one can relate the charged vector current coupling to the @xmath13 system to the electromagnetic ( neutral vector ) current measured by @xmath15 .",
    "there are two possible final states in @xmath9 annihilation channel is forbidden by isospin and charge conjugation invariance . ]",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 they are accessible by a different @xmath18 component of the same @xmath19 weak current describing @xmath1 decay : @xmath20 @xmath21 the relations between processes ( [ ee ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) can be written as @xmath22 @xmath23 the prediction for @xmath24 can thus be obtained from @xmath25 data and isospin invariance . such a procedure was successfully applied in @xcite where high statistics @xmath9 data from the cmd-2 detector collected at center of mass energies ( @xmath26 ) from @xmath10 to @xmath27 gev were used @xcite . since",
    "@xmath9 experiments are performed at fixed ( at a time ) @xmath26 , the integrated decay rates of @xmath28 to the @xmath13 are well measured as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the natural way of the @xmath1 decay generation is to generate first the mass of the @xmath13 system in accordance with the experimental distribution .",
    "then , for the fixed @xmath29 , the @xmath30 decay is generated .",
    "this is why in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath31 distribution is generated independently of the differential distribution within the @xmath13 system . the program is written and optimized to get maximum possible information from the experimental data .",
    "the approach of tauola is somewhat different .",
    "a matrix element well isolated in a program module is separated into the hadronic and leptonic current .",
    "all physical assumptions on hadronic interactions are located in the hadronic current which features intermediate state resonances as well as other properties of the hard process . the phase space density generation and in particular the appropriate jacobians for mapping random numbers to phase space coordinates , which are defined independently from the particular process , are also calculated in the separate part of the code .",
    "such an approach provides flexibility in studying particular choices of hadronic currents .",
    "in addition , the @xmath32 distribution is not an input , but originates from the ( partial ) monte carlo integration of the matrix element over phase space .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use the model of @xcite in the approach of tauola which is more natural for comparison with other theoretical calculations / models .",
    "0.3 cm    the matrix element used in tauola for the semileptonic decay @xmath33 is written in the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the matrix element of the @xmath36 current , relevant for the specific final state x. in general , the current @xmath37 depends on the momenta of all hadrons . @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 denote the four - momenta of the @xmath40 and @xmath1 respectively .",

    "if a more general coupling @xmath49 for the @xmath1 current and @xmath40 mass @xmath50 are expected to be used , one has to add the following terms to @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 @xmath54 to obtain the polarimeter vector @xmath55 in the @xmath1 rest frame , it is sufficient to calculate the space components of @xmath56 and set @xmath57 .",
    "the differential partial width for the channel under consideration reads : @xmath58 the phase space distribution for the final state with four mesons plus neutrino is given by the following expression where a compact notation with @xmath59 and @xmath60 is used , @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the solid angle element of the momentum of @xmath40 in the rest frame of @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the solid angle element of @xmath70 in the rest frame of @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the solid angle element of @xmath73 in the @xmath74 rest frame , and finally , @xmath75 is the solid angle element of @xmath76 in the @xmath77 rest frame",
    ". + these formula if used directly , are inefficient for a monte carlo algorithm if sharp peaks due to resonances in the intermediate states are present .",
    "we refer to the tauola documentation @xcite for details of the algorithm actually in use . for the present paper",
    "it is enough to note that those changes affect the program efficiency , but the actual density of the phase space remains intact .",
    "no approximations are introduced .    0.4 cm",
    "0.3 cm    the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the assumption that the @xmath78 and @xmath79 intermediate states ( which well describe the experiments on @xmath2 @xcite ) , are dominant in the amplitudes @xmath80 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that various two- and three - pion invariant mass distributions predicted by the model well describe experimental observations of cleo  @xcite and aleph  @xcite .",
    "we include into consideration two most important channels of the @xmath81 decay ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) as well as the @xmath84 channel",
    ". then for the process @xmath85 the current @xmath86 reads @xmath87 for the process @xmath88 , where the @xmath51 meson also contributes , it is @xmath89 where in the following we neglect the interference between the @xmath51 and @xmath90 currents .",
