    "the electrical transport properties of carbon nanotubes ( cns ) have been the subject of much research ever since the discovery by iijima @xcite of the quasi - one - dimensional monomolecular structures .",
    "this may be due to their abilities to exhibit bloch oscillations @xcite at moderate electric field strengths .",
    "this oscillatory response makes cns inherently nonlinear and as such can perform varieties of transport phenomena . under different conditions of an external electric field ,",
    "an electron is predicted to reveal a variety of physical effects such as bloch oscillations , self - induced transparency , negative differential conductivity , absolute negative conductance @xcite , etc .",
    "we shall demonstrate in this paper two phenomena in cns , which are self - induced transparency and absolute negative conductance for the following cases respectively :    * when the cns is exposed to an a.c electric field , i.e @xmath1 * when the cns is exposed to an a.c . and d.c electric field , i.e @xmath2",
    "following ref . @xcite and using the approach similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a response of electrons in an undoped achiral single - wall carbon nanotubes subject to an external electric field , @xmath3    we use the semiclassical approximation in which @xmath4-electrons are considered as classical particles with dispersion law extracted from the quantum theory in the tight - binding approximation @xcite .    considering the hexagonal crystalline structure of zigzag and armchair cnts within tight binding approximation ,",
    "the dispersion relation is given as @xcite respectively , @xmath5^{1/2}\\label{eq : two}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath6^{1/2}\\label{eq : three}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 ev is the overlapping integral , @xmath8 is the axial component of quasimomentum , @xmath9 is transverse quasimomentum level spacing and @xmath10 is an integer .",
    "the expression for @xmath11 in eqns . and",
    "is given as @xmath12 .",
    "with the c - c bond length @xmath13 nm and @xmath14 is the plank s constant , we shall assume @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 signs correspond to the valence and conduction bands , respectively . due to the transverse quantization of the quasi - momentum",
    ", its transverse component can take @xmath18 discrete values , @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 ) . unlike transverse quasimomentum @xmath21",
    ", the axial quasimomentum @xmath8 is assumed to vary continuously within the range @xmath22 , which corresponds to the model of infinitely long cnt ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this model is applicable to the case under consideration because of the restriction to the temperatures and /or voltages well above the level spacing @xcite , i.e , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is boltzmann constant , @xmath27 is the temperature , @xmath28 is the charging energy .",
    "the energy level spacing @xmath25 is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fermi velocity and @xmath31 is the carbon nanotube length @xcite    employing boltzmann equation with relaxation time @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electron charge , @xmath35 is the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath36 is the distribution function , and @xmath37 is the relaxation time . the electric field @xmath0 is applied along cnts axis . in this problem",
    "the relaxation term @xmath37 is assumed to be constant .",
    "expanding the distribution functions of interest in fourier series as ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 here the coefficient , @xmath40 is the dirac delta function , @xmath41 is the coefficient of the fourier series and @xmath42 is the factor by which the fourier transform of the nonequilibrium distribution function differs from its equilibrium distribution counterpart .",
    "the expression @xmath41 can be expanded in the analogous series as follows @xmath43 substituting eqns . and into eqn . ,",
    "and solving with eqn .",
    "we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the bessel function of the @xmath47 order and @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , taking into account the relation @xmath49 , we represent @xmath50 in fourier series with the coefficients as follows ; @xmath51 the quasiclassical velocity @xmath52 of an electron moving along the cns axis is given by the expression @xmath53 showing that the velocity of electron is a periodic function of the momentum .",
    "the electron surface current density @xmath54 along the cns axis is also given by the expression @xmath55 or @xmath56 where the integration is carried over the first brillouin zone .",
    "substituting eqns . , and",
    "into we find the current density for the cns after averaging over a period of time @xmath57 , as @xmath58 equation can be expressed in the form @xmath59}{[1 + ( \\omega r - k\\omega)^2\\tau^2][1 + ( \\omega r + k\\omega)^2\\tau^2]}\\big ] \\nonumber\\\\              & & \\times\\sum_{s=1}^{n}f_{rs}\\epsilon_{rs}. \\label{eq : thirteen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , eqn . takes the form @xmath62\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\times\\sum_{s=1}^{n}f_{rs}\\epsilon_{rs}. \\label{eq : fourteen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the bessel function of the zeroth order , @xmath65 for zigzag cns and @xmath66 for armchair cns .",
    "the second term in the bracket of equation is less than the first term ; however when again @xmath67 coincides with the roots of the zeroth order bessel function , the first term disappears and the current becomes negative , i.e. it flows against the applied d.c field .",
    "this phenomenon is called absolute negative conductivity and was first observed by kryuchkov _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "now , substituting @xmath68 in eqn . , we obtain @xmath69 hence , we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath63 , @xmath71 is the bessel function of the @xmath72 order . for @xmath73 ,",

    "using the boltzmann s transport equation with constant relaxation time , we theoretical study the electron transport phenomena in cns . for the condition of high - frequency fields , @xmath76 , an analytical expression for the current density was obtained in equation .",
    "[ fig : one ] . from eqn .",
    "it is observed that when @xmath67 is equal to the roots of the zeroth order bessel function ( 2.4 , 4.8 , 8.4 , 11.8 , 14.8 , 18.0 ) , @xmath54 becomes zero , i.e. there is no conduction , the cns behave as an insulator .",
    "this phenomenon is called total self induced transparency first observed by ignatov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . however , when the cns is exposed to an a.c . and d.c electric fields , i.e @xmath77 and @xmath61 , we obtained expression which is an indication for absolute negative conductivity i.e. current flows against the applied d.c field . see . fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have theoretically studied the effect of a.c and d.c electric field on the transport properties of cns . it is noted that in the presence of these fields , phenomena like total self induced transparency and absolute negative conductivity are observed .",
