    "mass transfer in binaries was found to be strong and thus to lead to generally high spins between 0.4 and 0.9 and spin - orbit alignment . in @xcite the accretion during the binary evolution increases the initial bh spin only moderately implying that the initial spin is the most important parameter .",
    "observations of x - ray binaries suggest that most bhs have spin parameters exceeding 0.5 with an average @xmath13 of @xmath10.6 @xcite .",
    "these spins correspond to upper limits of the ns - bh merger rate of @xmath1@xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "@xcite showed that for soft ( stiff ) eoss the ejecta masses can be a factor 5 lower ( 1.5 higher ) compared to those for the h4 eos , which is similar to our dd2 eos .",
    "the corresponding range of uncertainty is indicated by grey shading in fig .  [",
    "fig : rate ] .",
    "this variation is consistent with the eos effects quantified for ideal fluid eoss by @xcite for another binary setup .",
    "the relatively high ejecta masses found by @xcite for the soft ls220 eos suggest that a factor of 5 might overestimate changes associated with very soft eoss",
    ". moreover , theoretical arguments favor a nuclear eos comparable to or slightly softer than dd2  @xcite .",
    "variants of the standard model of @xcite for different metallicities ( e.g. , dashed lines in fig .  [ fig : rate ] for solar metallicity and/or `` submodel '' b ) yield ns - bh merger rates between @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the dash - dotted line in fig .  [ fig : rate ] provides a rate limit independent of population synthesis studies by using the observed bh mass distribution of @xcite with a median at 7.5@xmath8 . because of the lower mean bh mass , this case yields slightly lower rates than the population models .",
    "again , for an average @xmath460.5 this rate limit is roughly compatible with the merger rate derived from population synthesis at 1/10 solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "most population models predict ns - ns mergers to be more frequent than ns - bh collisions  @xcite .",
    "the average ejecta mass of ns - ns mergers depends strongly on the high - density eos and is typically smaller than that of ns - bh mergers .",
    "in contrast to ns - bh mergers , double ns collisions produce more ejecta for soft eoss  @xcite . in this case",
    "the population averaged ejecta mass may be @xmath47 , whereas stiff eoss lead to @xmath48 ; for the dd2 eos @xmath49 amounts to @xmath1@xmath50  @xcite .",
    "average galactic ns - bh merger rate vs.  ns - ns merger rate for the dd2 eos ( reddish band ) , a stiff eos ( bluish band ) , and a soft eos ( greenish band ) .",
    "the widths of the bands represent variations with average bh spins between 0.5 and 0.7 .",
    "symbols indicate `` optimistic '' ( triangle ) , `` realistic '' ( diamond ) and `` pessimistic '' ( square ) merger rates as compiled in @xcite .",

    "the reddish band in fig .  [ fig : cor ] shows this relation between the two rates for our standard model ( dd2 , @xmath31 ) and an average @xmath13 between 0.5 and 0.7 .",
    "the two merger rates are anti - correlated : higher contributions from ns - ns mergers reduce the ones from ns - bh mergers and vice versa .",
    "such an anti - correlation also holds for different eoss but with distinct shifts because of the opposite dependences of @xmath49 and @xmath34 on the stiffness of the eos . for very soft eoss ( greenish band ) @xmath34 may be reduced by at most a factor five relative to the dd2 case , whereas @xmath53 should be @xmath1@xmath54 .",
    "if ns - bh mergers dominate , their rate limit is correspondingly higher , while for ns - ns binaries as main source the relatively large ejecta mass per event leads to tighter rate constraints .",
    "the opposite trends apply for stiff eoss ( bluish band ) , which yield stronger limits for @xmath55 but allow for more ns - ns coalescences .",
    "the intermediate ( reddish ) case implies that ns - ns mergers as additional r - process source set a strict upper bound of @xmath1@xmath56 for the ns - bh merger rate .",
    "the bluish and greenish bands represent rather extreme eos variations .    the symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor ] display `` pessimistic '' ( square ) , `` realistic '' ( diamond ) and `` optimistic '' ( triangle ) merger rates of both event types as compiled in  @xcite to estimate the gw detection probability by advanced ligo and advanced virgo .",
    "the `` optimistic '' case is practically ruled out by our estimates because already ns - bh or ns - ns mergers alone would overproduce r - process nuclei .",
    "the `` realistic '' expectations for ns - ns and ns - bh detection rates ( diamond ) are marginally consistent with our constraints .    the vertical solid line in fig .  [ fig : cor ] marks @xmath55 derived from the observed binary ns population @xcite with thin vertical lines indicating the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "only very stiff eoss allow for a substantial ns - bh merger rate that is clearly compatible with the observed double - ns population .",
    "the thick dashed line shows the sum @xmath57 , which roughly corresponds to a volumetric rate of @xmath58 derived from the observed short - grb rate and inferred jet opening angles @xcite .",
    "here we use a crude conversion from the volumetric rate to a galactic merger rate @xcite and assume that every ns - bh and ns - ns merger produces a beamed grb . giving up the latter assumption would result in a higher rate , i.e. , a curve shifted to the upper right .",
    "given the involved uncertainties the rate inferred from grbs is roughly compatible with our estimates , which might be a hint that the far majority of coms result in grbs unless another , r - process inactive source contributes to making short grbs .",
    "any rate estimates , e.g.  by population synthesis models , should be checked for consistency with the correlation given by eq .  .",
    "for instance , considering the r - process yields of ns - ns mergers , the ns - bh merger rates of  @xcite are roughly compatible with our constraint .",
    "we emphasize that our time - averaged rates are upper limits of the current merger rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our rate constraints would even become more stringent if ns - ns and ns - bh mergers were not the only sources of @xmath0 r - process elements ( for suggestions , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while eccentric coms with their higher ejecta masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might occur with significant frequencies in dense stellar systems @xcite , additional ejecta from massive nss and bh - torus systems as remnants of coms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are expected to contribute to the production of @xmath27 r - nuclei only on a lower level @xcite .",
    "conversely , our bounds would be somewhat higher if coms were less efficient in enriching the galactic gas with r - elements , which might be suggested by the fact that 50% of the short grbs exhibit projected offsets of @xmath291.5 times the half - light radii of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "we quantified an independent upper limit on the ns - bh merger rate , which , however , depends on the uncertain average bh spin . adopting a moderately big spin parameter of @xmath590.5 , the average merger rate should be @xmath60@xmath61 with an uncertainty factor of a few .",
    "we point out that the ns - bh merger rate is correlated with the ns - ns coalescence rate , and population synthesis models should be checked for consistency with our combined constraint .",
    "the gw detection rates classified as `` optimistic '' ( `` realistic '' ) for advanced ligo and virgo  @xcite are incompatible ( marginally consistent ) with our estimates considering that we deduced time - averaged rates , which are probably higher than the current rate relevant for gw detections @xcite ; but see @xcite for opposite trends .",
    "our rate limits are also roughly consistent with the possibility that ns - ns and ns - bh mergers are the dominant sources of short grbs .    for improving our estimates ,",
    "relativistic ns - bh merger simulations are needed for larger sets of high - density eoss , different ns masses and bh spin orientations . instead of time - averaged rate constraints",
    "a time - dependent analysis is desirable , accounting for the galactic metallicity evolution and a consistent treatment of the metallicity dependence of ns - ns and ns - bh populations . more observational data on bh spins and a better understanding of natal bh spins and the spin evolution would reduce uncertainties considerably .",
