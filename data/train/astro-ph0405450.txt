    "the nearest star - forming regions are dominated by populations of young low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars , or t tauri stars .",
    "hundreds of t tauri stars have now been identified in the taurus - auriga , chamaeleon , and rho ophiuchus molecular clouds at distances of @xmath6160 pc .",
    "their masses are less than @xmath72 m@xmath8 and they are the progenitors of late - type main sequence stars such as the sun . in contrast , more massive pms stars are rare in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "these elusive objects evolve rapidly onto the main sequence and can remain optically obscured during much of their pms phase .",
    "however , a few nearby optically - bright pms stars of intermediate mass ( @xmath72 - 10 m@xmath8 ) are known .",
    "they are generally categorized as herbig ae / be stars ( herbig 1960 ; herbig & bell 1988 ) , which are thought to be more massive analogs of classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) .",
    "they are often located in or near molecular clouds in the vicinity of t tauri stars and have properties similar to ctts including h@xmath0 emission , infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar material ( disks , envelopes , or both ) , and poorly - understood photometric and spectroscopic variability ( appenzeller 1994 ; finkenzeller & mundt 1984 , hereafter fm84 ; herbig 1994 ; hillenbrand et al .",
    "in addition , mass outflows are often detected ( fm84 ; garrison & anderson 1977 ; garrison 1978 ; skinner , brown , & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "one of the nearest known herbig ae stars is hd 104237 (= dx cha ) , lying in the recently discovered @xmath9 cha group at a _ hipparcos _ distance of 116 pc ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ; van den ancker , de winter , & tjin a djie 1988 , hereafter awd98 ) .",
    "this star has attracted considerable observational attention because of its proximity , optical brightness ( v = 6.6 mag ) , and relatively low visual extinction a@xmath10 @xmath1 1 mag .",
    "its properties are summarized in table 1 .",
    "it does not lie in a molecular cloud but molecular gas has been detected in its vicinity ( knee & prusti 1996 ) and age estimates range from @xmath72 - 5 my ( awd98 ; feigelson , lawson , & garmire 2003 , hereafter flg03 ; grady et al . 2004 , hereafter g04 ) .",

    "1997 ) or a7.5ve - a8ve ( g04 ) .    observations with the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ reveal a clear ir excess and a strong 10 @xmath11 m silicate feature ( meeus et al . 2001 ) . the ir excess can be modeled in terms of a passive irradiated disk with a small but uncertain outer radius of @xmath710 - 20 au ( dominik et al .",

    "observations that were obtained as part of a limited snaphsot survey of herbig stars ( flg03 ) .",
    "this snapshot survey also detected the herbig stars hd 100546 ( b9vne ) , hd 141569 ( b9.5ve ) , and hd 150193 ( a1ve ) . these high angular resolution _",
    "detections substantiate earlier reports of x - ray emission from herbig stars , including eleven x - ray detections obtained with the _ einstein _ observatory ( damiani et al .",
    "1994 ) and a surprisingly high detection rate of nearly 50% in a sample of 30 herbig ae / be stars observed by _ rosat _ ( zinnecker & preibisch 1994 , hereafter zp94 ; preibisch & zinnecker 1996 ) .",
    "the apparent presence of x - ray emission from herbig stars is difficult to explain in the context of current theories of stellar x - ray emission .",
    "herbig be stars and earlier ae stars are on radiative tracks and are not expected to have the outer convection zones needed to sustain internally - generated magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , x - ray emission from magnetically - trapped coronal plasma such as occurs in the sun and other cool stars is not expected . however , some recent evolutionary models such as those of siess , dufour , & forestini ( 2000 ) suggest that later herbig ae stars of spectral types a6e - a8e could have very thin convection zones ( giardino et al .",
    "2004 ) , thus raising the interesting possibility of incipient solar - like magnetic activity in later ae stars ( see also sec .",
    "7.3 ) . finally , it is very unlikely that the x - ray emission of herbig ae stars arises in radiative wind shocks , as may be the case for much more massive o - type stars .",
    "the instabilities that are thought to produce x - ray emitting shocks in the supersonic winds of o stars are not predicted to occur in the more benign winds of ae stars , which typically have velocities v@xmath14 @xmath12 200 - 600 km s@xmath4 and ionized mass loss rates @xmath15 @xmath16 10@xmath17 m@xmath8 yr@xmath4 ( fm84 ; skinner , brown , & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , x - ray temperatures of several kev have now been detected in herbig ae stars ( including hd 104237 ) , and such temperatures are inconsistent with the soft emission predicted by radiative wind shock models ( sy96 ) .",
    "a possible explanation of the x - ray emission from herbig stars is that it arises from faint late - type companions .",
    "however , _",
    "chandra s _ arcsecond angular resolution is now placing tight upper limits on the separation of such putative x - ray companions from the herbig star . as discussed in more detail below , _",
    "_ observations of hd 104237 show that the x - ray peak is offset by @xmath11@xmath5 from the stellar optical position , thus ruling out the faint star seen 1.365@xmath5 away by _ hst _ as the x - ray source .",
    "chandra s _ angular resolution is not sufficient to exclude the presence of a cool secondary at separations of @xmath11@xmath5 , the recent _ hst _ observations fail to find any evidence for a t tauri companion at separations 0.05@xmath5",
    "@xmath16 1.0@xmath5 ( g04 ) . this still does not rule out an unseen companion at @xmath18 @xmath16 0.05@xmath5 , but it is worth keeping in mind that other factors could lead to intrinsic x - ray emission from herbig stars themselves .",
    "of potential importance is their extreme youth and rapid rotation .",
    "their ages are usually less than a few million years ( strom et al .",
    "1972 ; hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 ) and typical rotational velocities are @xmath19sin@xmath20 @xmath12 80 - 150 km s@xmath4 ( finkenzeller 1985 ; bhm & catala 1995 ) .",
    "interestingly , a much lower value @xmath19sin@xmath20 = 12 @xmath13 2 km s@xmath4 has been measured for hd 104237 by donati et al .",
    "_ hst _ observations indicate that this low @xmath19sin@xmath20 is probably a result of the system being viewed nearly pole - on at an inclination angle @xmath20 = 18@xmath21@xmath22 ( g04 ) .",
    "because of their youth , primordial magnetic fields inherited from the parent molecular cloud may still be present , and a marginal detection of a magnetic field in hd 104237 has been reported by donati et al .",
    "it has also been suggested that the shear energy in a young rapidly - rotating star might give rise to a nonsolar dynamo , allowing an internally - generated field to be sustained in the youngest herbig stars that decays rapidly over a few million years ( tout & pringle 1995 ; vigneron et al .",
    "if magnetic fields are indeed present , they could lead to magnetic plasma confinement and x - ray emission .",
    "we present here new x - ray observations of hd 104237 obtained with _ xmm - newton _ that were motivated by the unanswered question of the origin of x - ray emission from herbig stars .",
    "the new data provide higher signal - to - noise ccd spectra and x - ray light curves than were previously available . based on the inferred plasma properties",
    ", we argue for a magnetic origin for the x - ray emission .",
    "we use previously published and archived x - ray data for a distance - limited sample of herbig stars to make comparisons with lower mass t tauri stars and classical be stars .",
    "we show that if herbig stars are the evolutionary precursors of classical be stars then a substantial falloff in the x - ray luminosities of herbig stars is expected after they reach the main sequence , and a possible link with the similar behavior predicted by shear - dynamo theory is noted .",

    "our analysis is based on ccd images , spectra , and light curves from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) .",

    "several other x - ray sources are present in the epic images , as listed in table 3 and shown in figure 3 .",
    "the source list in table 3 is based on a visual comparison of the pn and mos images with the list of pn sources detected in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev range as part of the standard _ xmm - newton _ pipeline processing .",
    "this processing uses the sas sliding box detection algorithm _ eboxdetect _ along with maximum - likelihood task _ emldetect _ for psf fitting .",
    "table 3 includes only those pn sources that were also confirmed to be present in one or both mos detectors , thus minimizing spurious detections at the risk of omitting some faint sources .",
    "candidate near - ir or optical counterparts lying within 5@xmath5 of the x - ray positions were found for 9 of the 19 sources in table 3 , two of which are late - type stars .",

    "the b9vn star @xmath9 cha lies @xmath122.2@xmath23 southwest of hd 104237 and they form a common proper motion pair . molecular gas has been detected around @xmath9 cha and it may be a young object ( knee & prusti 1996 ) , but it lacks the emission lines needed to be classified as a herbig be star .",
    "we did not detect @xmath9 cha with _ xmm - newton _",

    "the upper limit obtained from the epic pn image is log l@xmath3 ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) @xmath16 27.8 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "here we have assumed a 1 kev thermal plasma spectrum with an absorption n@xmath30 = 1.1 @xmath31 10@xmath32 @xmath33 corresponding to a@xmath10 = 0.5 mag ( knee & prusti 1996 ) , and a _ hipparcos _ distance of 112 pc .",
    "chandra _ upper limit log l@xmath3 @xmath16 27.7 ergs s@xmath4 ( flg03 ) is slightly more stringent because of _ chandra s _ much lower detector background .",
    "figure 4 shows the background - subtracted epic - pn x - ray light curve of hd 104237 in the [ 0.5 - 5 ] kev range .",
    "we have used this restricted energy range for light curve analysis in order to minimize the possibility of contamination from soft and hard background photons .",
    "no large - amplitude variations are visible in the pn light curve but a slow falloff in the count rate is apparent .",
    "this decline is also seen in the background - subtracted mos light curves and in pn light curves constructed with other energy filters including a soft filter in the range [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev and a hard filter of [ 2.0 - 5.0 ] kev .",
    "the mean count rate for the pn light curve in figure 4 is @xmath11 = 0.25 @xmath13 0.04 c s@xmath4 ( @xmath131 @xmath34 ) . during the first 4 ks of the observation",
    "the mean is @xmath11 = 0.27 @xmath13 0.03 c s@xmath4 while the last 4 ks gives @xmath11 = 0.23 @xmath13 0.03 c s@xmath4 .",
    "the probability of a constant count rate from a @xmath35 analysis of the pn light curve binned at 200 s intervals is p@xmath36 = 0.18 and smaller values p@xmath36 @xmath1 0.01 are obtained from the summed mos1 @xmath37 mos2 light curve .",
    "as an additional check for variability , we have applied the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( press et al . 1992 ) to the unbinned pn event list , using events in the [ 0.5 - 5 ] kev range from a contiguous good - time interval during the last 9880 s of the observation . for the event extraction region shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the ks test gives p@xmath36 = 0.001 .",
    "if we instead use a simpler extraction region consisting of all events inside a small circle of radius r@xmath25 = 8@xmath5 centered on hd 104237 , then the ks test gives p@xmath36 = 0.068 .",
    "the above results suggest that low - level variablity is quite likely present in the light curve .",
    "however , the origin of the variability remains ambiguous because of the nearby faint sources that are not clearly resolved from hd 104237 at _ xmm - newton s _ angular resolution .",
    "our analysis shows that the apparent low - level variability is present using source extraction regions centered on hd 104237 with radii as small as r@xmath25 = 6@xmath5 - 7@xmath5 .",
    "such a small extraction region excludes most of the photons from sources d and e , but contains photons from sources b and c in addition to those from hd 104237 .",
    "thus , sources d and e are not likely to be responsible for the variability . the most probable origin",
    "would then be hd 104237 itself , or sources b or c , or perhaps an as yet undetected close companion to hd 104237 .",
    "we emphasize that even though the _ xmm - newton _ observation has insufficient angular resolution to rule out variability from sources b or c , the two _ chandra _ observations found no significant variability in source b and showed that source c is very faint ( flg03 ) .",
    "the two _ chandra _ exposures were separated by eight months in time and provide an additional check for variability . even though the exposures were short ( @xmath123 ks each ) , there is little or no contamination of the x - ray light curves by nearby sources b , c , d , and e because of _ chandra s _ higher angular resolution .",
    "the light curves show count rate fluctuations at the 2@xmath34 level but no statistically significant variability was found in either _ chandra _ observation . however , the mean count rate during the second observation was somewhat higher than the first .",
    "the first observation detected 382 @xmath13 20 counts in 2.96 ks within a circle of radius 3.9@xmath5 centered on hd 104237 , giving a mean rate in the 0.5 - 7 kev range @xmath11 = 0.13 @xmath13 0.01 ( 1@xmath34 ) c s@xmath4 . using the same extraction region ,",
    "the second observation gave 477 @xmath13 22 counts in 2.83 ks and @xmath11 = 0.17 @xmath13 0.01 c s@xmath4 ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) .",
    "these count rates may slightly underestimate the true values because of moderate photon pileup in acis - i .",
    "the @xmath1230% higher count rate during the second observation may reflect real long - term variability , but the inferred change is of low statistical significance because of the scatter in the two light curves .    slowly declining light curves similar to that detected by _ xmm - newton _ have been seen in other pre - main sequence stars , such as the ctts haro 5 - 59 in orion ( fig .",
    "7 of skinner , gagn , & belzer 2003 ) . in some cases",
    ", the decline lasts for at least a day .",
    "the origin of such slow variability is not yet understood but possible explanations include the late decay phase of an x - ray flare that occurred prior to the observation or dynamical effects such as the rotation of an active region out of the line - of - sight .",
    "the absence of a detectable change in hardness ratio or temperature in the _ xmm - newton _ light curve of hd 104237 suggests that the slow variability was due to a change in the emission measure , perhaps through dynamical effects .",
    "obviously , longer term monitoring over timescales of days to weeks is needed to more accurately characterize the level of the variability and further constrain its origin .",
    "figure 5 shows the epic - pn spectrum , which provides a higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio for spectral analysis than the mos .",
    "three emission line features are clearly visible and are identified with transitions in the following he - like ions , where e@xmath38 is the laboratory line energy and t@xmath39 ( k ) is the temperature at which the line emits maximum power : si xiii ( e@xmath38 = 1.86 kev , log t@xmath39 = 7.0 ) , ca xix ( e@xmath38 = 3.90 kev , log t@xmath39 = 7.4 ) , and the fe k@xmath0 complex which includes fe xxv ( e@xmath38 = 6.67 kev , log t@xmath39 = 7.6 ) .",
    "the individual components of the he - like triplets are not spectrally resolved by the pn or mos detectors .",

    "_ fluorescent fe i k@xmath0 ? _ in addition to the obvious line detections listed above , our analysis of the unbinned photon event list from the pn detector shows a weak feature at an energy slightly above 6.4 kev .",
    "a gaussian fit of this feature gives a mean energy @xmath40e@xmath41 = 6.46 [ 6.36 - 6.61 ; 90% conf . ]",
    "this feature is not present in the background spectrum .",
    "if real , this feature could be a weak detection of fluorescent emission from neutral iron ( fe i k@xmath0 ) in cold material surrounding the star .",
    "such fluorescent iron lines have recently been detected by _",
    "chandra _ in other hot stars such as the classical be star @xmath42 cas ( smith et al .",
    "however , we caution that : ( i ) the statistical significance of this detection is low , ( ii ) the feature is not seen in the lower s / n mos data for hd 104237 , and ( iii ) some blending of this feature with higher energy photons from the fe k@xmath0 complex ( @xmath126.67 kev ) could be present at the spectral resolution of the pn detector ( which is @xmath120.13 kev at 6.5 kev ) .",
    "it is thus clear that more sensitive observations will be needed to determine if fe i k@xmath0 emission is indeed present .",
    "x - ray temperatures and em distribution : _ acceptable fits of the spectrum were obtained using absorbed variable - abundance multi - temperature optically thin plasma models , as summarized in table 4 .",
    "for these fits , we used the _ vapec _ model as implemented in xspec v. 11.1 .",
    "in addition , fits of comparable quality were obtained with the differential emission measure ( dem ) model _ c6pvmkl _ , which approximates the dem using a sixth order chebyshev polynomial .",
    "single - temperature ( 1 t ) _ vapec _ models were not acceptable , but satisfactory fits were obtained using both two - temperature ( 2 t ) and three - temperature ( 3 t ) models , with 3 t models giving slightly better fits as shown in figure 5 ( see also table 4 ) .",
    "the 2 t and 3 t models are qualitatively similar in that they both require cooler plasma at kt @xmath1 1 kev and a hotter component at kt @xmath12 3 kev .",
    "however , the 3 t model requires higher absorption and places a larger fraction of the total emission measure ( em ) in cooler plasma below 1 kev .",
    "acceptable fits were obtained with the 2 t and 3 t models using an fe abundance that is consistent with solar , but an overabundance is inferred for ca and perhaps ne .",

    "assuming that all of the x - ray emission attributed to hd 104237 arises in an as yet undetected t tauri companion , then the canonical relation log ( l@xmath3/l@xmath52 ) @xmath12 @xmath293.75 for tts yields a bolometric luminosity log l@xmath52 @xmath12 34.25 , or l@xmath52 @xmath12 4 - 5 l@xmath8 for the putative companion .",
    "however , this value is highly uncertain because of the scatter in the l@xmath3 versus l@xmath52 relation for tts .",
    "the alternative to the companion hypothesis is that some , or all , of the x - ray emission is due to the herbig star itself . assuming that magnetic confinement is necessary to explain the observed high - temperature plasma ,",
    "then the emission could very well arise in a corona .",
    "another possibility is a magnetically - confined wind shock , as has been proposed to explain the x - ray emission of some magnetic ap - bp stars such as iq aur ( babel & montmerle 1997 ) .",

    "@xmath12 400 - 600 km s@xmath4 typical of herbig ae stars .",
    "thus , this model can not explain the high - temperature plasma at kt @xmath2 3 kev .",
    "in late - type stars , an outer convection zone is thought to be necessary to support magnetic ( e.g. coronal ) activity via a solar - like dynamo .",
    "the region in the hr diagram where surface convection zones first appear is somewhat uncertain , as recently reviewed by favata & micela ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , the _ rosat _ detection of intrinsic x - ray emission from altair ( a7iv - v ) ( schmitt 1997 ) provides compelling evidence that surface convection is already present in some late a - type stars .",
    "the recent classification of hd 104237 as a7.5ve - a8ve based on _ hst _ observations ( g04 ) thus raises the interesting possibility that some of its x - ray emission might be associated with surface convection .",
    "however , the evolutionary tracks of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that a surface convection zone in hd 104237 would be quite thin , amounting to @xmath120.9% of the stellar radius ( assuming t@xmath48 = 7300 k , log [ l@xmath53/l@xmath8 ] = 1.42 ) .",
    "it is not obvious why such a thin convection zone would give rise to an x - ray luminosity that is @xmath71000 times greater than that of altair , which has a similar a7v spectral type .",
    "it may thus be that other factors , perhaps associated with youth , lead to elevated x - ray emission levels of herbig stars - as discussed below .",
    "it has been suggested that coronal x - ray emission could be sustained in a young rapidly - rotating herbig star via a magnetic field set up by non - solar dynamo action that is powered by rotational shear energy .",
    "this possibility was explored by vigneron et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in the theoretical framework of sheared stratified fluids .",
    "a later development of this model by tout & pringle ( 1995 , hereafter tp95 ) provides a quantitative prediction of the x - ray luminosity versus age , l@xmath3(t ) , but makes no temperature predictions . in the tp95 formulation , @xmath60^{-3 } } \\ ] ] in the above , the initial x - ray luminosity l@xmath61 depends on the stellar mass m@xmath53 , radius r@xmath53 , change in the star s angular velocity between its center and surface ( @xmath62 ) , breakup velocity ( @xmath63 ) , and two dimensionless parameters of the theory @xmath9 and @xmath42 according to ( eq .",

    "the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath42 are not well - determined empirically , with @xmath9 being the fraction of magnetic flux that is dissipated at the stellar surface to heat coronal plasma and @xmath42 the efficiency of magnetic field generation .",
    "the decay timescale t@xmath65 also depends on @xmath42 , m@xmath53 , and r@xmath53 .",

    "thus , this mechanism could sustain magnetic activity in a herbig ae star for a few million years , but drops off rapidly as t@xmath66 thereafter .",
    "a comparison of the predicted l@xmath3 from the above model with that measured for hd 104237 by _ asca _ was made by sy96 .",

    "( 2000 ) give m@xmath53 = 2.14 m@xmath8 and r@xmath53 = 3.0 r@xmath8 . in that case",
    ", the decay timescale is t@xmath65 @xmath7 2.2 my , and the model underestimates the x - ray luminosity ( table 1 ) by a factor of @xmath725 .",
    "the above calculations show that uncertainties in ages , masses , and theoretical parameters such as @xmath9 and @xmath42 currently limit observational tests of the tp95 model to order - of - magnitude comparisons .",
    "we have made additional comparisons of the predicted l@xmath3 from the tp95 model with the observed values listed for the other herbig stars in table 5 . in these comparisons",
    "we have used stellar parameters given in the literature ( i.e. awd98 ) as well as our own estimates from the siess et al .",
    "tracks , along with the fiducial values of @xmath9 and @xmath42 given above .",
    "elias 1 was excluded from this comparison since it was not included in the awd98 _ hipparcos_-based study and there are significant differences in reported values for its stellar luminosity and radius in the literature ( e.g. berrilli et al .",
    "1992 ; hillenbrand et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the model gives very good agreement for ab aur and hd 97048 , and it may be relevant that speckle techniques have so far failed to find any evidence for close companions around these two stars ( leinert , richichi , & haas 1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "however , the model tends to underestimate l@xmath3 by as much as an order - of - magnitude in other cases , as already noted above for hd 104237",
    ". the discrepancy could be even larger for the b9ve star hd 141569 if its age is t @xmath54 10 my ( awd98 ) .",
    "however , a younger age t @xmath7 5 @xmath13 3 my has been inferred based on its association with two young m - type common proper motion companions ( weinberger et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if this younger age is correct , then the model prediction is within an order of magnitude of the observed value for hd 141569 .",
    "the main results of this study are the following :    1 .",
    "new x - ray spectra of the herbig ae star hd 104237 obtained with _ xmm - newton _ provide the first clear detection of emission lines in this star , including si xiii , ca xix , and the fe k@xmath0 complex .",
    "the x - ray emission arises in an absorbed multi - temperature thermal plasma with cool ( kt @xmath1 1 kev ) and hot ( kt @xmath2 3 kev ) components .",
    "the inferred x - ray absorption is equivalent to an extinction a@xmath10 @xmath12 0.3 - 1.0 mag , with best - fit models converging toward the high end of this range .",
    "this range is consistent with that determined from optical studies .",
    "the presence of hot plasma at kt @xmath2 3 kev is not consistent with shock model predictions , but is typical of values observed in magnetically - active pms stars such as t tauri stars .",
    "we conclude that the emission arises in magnetically - confined plasma , substantiating earlier _ asca _ results .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ light curve shows signs of slow variability at the @xmath1215% level on a timescale of @xmath7hours , and a comparison of two _ chandra _ observations taken eight months apart also suggests that low - level variability may be present . more persistent time monitoring over longer timespans is needed to confirm the suspected variability and constrain the timescale(s ) .",
    "if short - term ( @xmath7hours ) variability is confirmed , it would lend further support to a magnetic interpretation for the x - ray emission .",
    "the precise nature and location of the magnetically - confined region is not yet known , but a corona around the herbig star ( or an as yet unseen close companion ) is a likely possibility .",
    "archived _ chandra _ images show that the x - ray emission peak is offset by @xmath10.6@xmath5 from the stellar optical position , which equates to a projected separation @xmath170 au at d = 116 pc .",
    "this small offset places stringent limits on the angular separation of a putative late - type x - ray companion , leaving open the possibility that some ( or all ) of the x - ray emission arises in the herbig star itself .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of a sample of ten herbig ae / be stars with reliable distances are in the range log l@xmath3 = 29.9 @xmath13 1.0 ( ergs s@xmath4 ) , which overlaps the range observed for t tauri stars .",
    "thus , x - ray emission from unseen t tauri companions is not ruled out on the basis of l@xmath3 considerations .",
    "for this distance - limited herbig star sample , we obtain a mean ratio log ( l@xmath3/l@xmath52 ) = @xmath295.4@xmath55 , which is less than for t tauri stars and greater than for classical bve stars .",
    "if the hypothesis that herbig stars evolve into classical bve stars is true , then the l@xmath3 values of herbig stars must decrease dramatically after reaching the main sequence , and such a decrease is predicted by shear dynamo models .",
    "the shear dynamo model of tout & pringle ( 1995 ) provides an alternative to the companion hypothesis for explaining x - ray emission in herbig stars .",
    "a comparison of the predictions of this model against known l@xmath3 values for a sample of nine herbig stars shows very good agreement in two cases ( ab aur and hd 97048 )",
    ". however , the model tends to underestimate l@xmath3 in all other cases by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "several factors could account for this disagreement including uncertain ages and masses , poorly - known model parameters that characterize magnetic processes , and excess x - ray emission from unseen lower mass companions .",
    "this study strongly suggests that the x - ray emission detected within 0.6@xmath5 of the hd 104237 optical position is of magnetic origin .",
    "the question that remains is whether the emission is coming from the herbig star itself , or from an as yet undetected companion .",
    "the existing _ chandra _ images show that if the emission is due to a companion , then its separation is @xmath18 @xmath1 1@xmath5 from hd 104237 .",
    "recent _ hst _ images ( g04 ) place a tighter constraint of @xmath18 @xmath10.05@xmath5 on the separation of a t tauri companion . such a close companion , if present , can not be spatially resolved with existing x - ray telescopes .",
    "even so , further progress on the companion issue may nevertheless be possible at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "for example , high - quality images and spectra comparable to those of hd 104237 could be obtained for a much larger sample of herbig stars , selected from the more than one hundred known and candidate members of the class ( th , de winter , & prez 1994 ) .",
    "a more extensive x - ray data base would provide more complete information on plasma properties ( kt , em distribution ) , the x - ray luminosity function , and positional offsets .",
    "this information could then be used in statistical comparisons to determine if the x - ray properties of t tauri stars are significantly different from herbig ae / be stars .",

    "<S> the origin of the x - ray emission from herbig ae / be stars is not yet known . </S>",
    "<S> these intermediate mass pre - main sequence stars lie on radiative tracks and are not expected to emit x - rays via solar - like magnetic processes , nor are their winds powerful enough to produce x - rays by radiative wind shocks as in more massive o - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> the emission could originate in unseen low - mass companions , or it may be intrinsic to the herbig stars themselves if they still have primordial magnetic fields or can sustain magnetic activity via a nonsolar dynamo .    </S>",
    "<S> we present new x - ray observations of the nearby herbig ae star hd 104237 (= dx cha ) with _ xmm - newton _ , whose objective is to clarify the origin of the emission . </S>",
    "<S> several x - ray emission lines are clearly visible in the ccd spectra , including the high - temperature fe k@xmath0 complex . </S>",
    "<S> the emission can be accurately modeled as a multi - temperature thermal plasma with cool ( kt @xmath1 1 kev ) and hot ( kt @xmath2 3 kev ) components . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a hot component is compelling evidence that the x - rays originate in magnetically confined plasma , either in the herbig star itself or in the corona of an as yet unseen late - type companion . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray temperatures and luminosity ( log l@xmath3 = 30.5 ergs s@xmath4 ) are within the range expected for a t tauri companion , but high resolution _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ and _ hst _ images constrain the separation of a putative companion to @xmath11@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we place these new results into broader context by comparing the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of a sample of nearby herbig stars with those of t tauri stars and classical main - sequence be stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also test the predictions of a model that attributes the x - ray emission of herbig stars to magnetic activity that is sustained by a shear - powered dynamo . </S>"
