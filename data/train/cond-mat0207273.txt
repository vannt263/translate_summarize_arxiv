    "the phenomenology of very different glassy systems ( spin glasses , structural glasses , pinned defects ) exhibits striking similarities .",
    "this is often discussed in terms of complex energy landscape , with some universal features in the organisation of valleys , saddles and barriers @xcite .",
    "mean - field models suggest that the energy landscape of some systems are hierarchical , with a self - similar organisation of valleys within valleys @xcite . this picture has been advocated to interpret @xcite the striking rejuvenation and memory effects during temperature cycling experiments , observed first in spin - glasses , but also in disordered ferromagnets , dipolar glasses , polymer glasses ( pmma ) or gelatin @xcite .",
    "another general framework to understand disordered systems is the droplet picture , developed in the context of spin - glasses and of pinned manifolds ( domain walls , vortices , etc . )",
    "the approach aims at describing the physics in terms of localized excitations of different size ( droplets ) , with an energy scale that grows with their size . as emphasized in @xcite , these two approaches",
    "are in fact complementary , and the dynamics in the droplet model is naturally hierarchical , due to the strong separation of time scales with length scales and with temperature .",
    "temperature plays the role of a microscope since the active length scales that contribute to the dynamics are very different at different temperatures .    in both pictures ,",
    "memory conservation is due to this separation of time scales with temperature @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the origin of _ rejuvenation",
    "_ , however , is different . in the hierarchical landscape framework ,",
    "a small temperature drop ( from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) reveals finer details of the random energy landscape , among which the system must reequilibrate . in other words , small length scales , that are ` unpinned ' at temperature @xmath0 , freeze at @xmath2 , thereby producing a strong out of equilibrium signal ( rejuvenation ) .",
    "this scenario can be given some precise meaning in the context of the random energy model ( rem ) close to its critical temperature @xcite , or in the generalized ( multilevel ) rem where rejuvenation and memory effects very similar to experiments can indeed be observed @xcite . on the other hand , rejuvenation effects in the droplet model",
    "have been attributed to ` temperature chaos ' : for any temperature difference @xmath3 , the equilibrium configurations at the two temperatures are completely different beyond a certain length scale @xmath4 , called the overlap length , that diverges when @xmath5 as a power - law . correspondingly , the correlation of the free - energies at the two temperatures are thought to decay with the size of the system @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "this scenario , postulated for spin - glasses in @xcite , has been given credit recently in the context of directed polymers @xcite .",
    "in this case , both analytical arguments and numerical results point towards the existence of an overlap length , although the free - energy decorrelation appears to be much slower than exponential in the size of the system . for spin - glasses ,",
    "the status of temperature chaos is still controversial and unclear as compared to the influence of other , stronger perturbations such as magnetic field changes or coupling strength changes .",
    "results in mean - field spin glasses @xcite and numerical calculations for small systems @xcite hint at extremely weak chaotic effects in temperature .",
    "this conclusion extends also to short - range systems where chaotic effects in the equilibrium properties seem to be extremely weak @xcite .",
    "chaotic effects , if any , seem to appear only for quite large systems even when @xmath8 is of order one @xcite . nevertheless , some recent spin - glass experiments were interpreted in terms of an overlap length @xcite , whereas numerical simulations of the 4d edwards - anderson model has revealed rejuvenation due to small scale freezing without chaos @xcite .",
    "( for a detailed study in the 3d edwards - anderson model and a discussion about why rejuvenation effects are not observed in simulations see @xcite ) .    in view of the controversy",
    ", we feel that more work on the subject is needed .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study in details the question of ` temperature chaos ' on the sinai model , which is the simplest model where the energy landscape is _ explicitely hierarchical _ , and for which many exact results are available @xcite .",
    "the sinai model was discussed in this context in @xcite ; preliminary results were obtained by h. yoshino , but no systematic study had been performed .",
    "the sinai model is an example of a one dimensional self - similar potential with long - range correlations . in high dimensions , this problem is equivalent to a mean - field spin - glass with a continuous replica symmetry breaking solution @xcite . in one dimension , however , there is no phase transition : the long time , large scale behaviour of the system is ruled by the zero - temperature fixed point , where the deepest minimum dominates .",
    "this is because the entropy in this model is of order one , whereas the energy scale grows as @xmath9 .",
    "since the location and energy of the minimum is temperature independent , there can not be any true temperature chaos in this problem . however , there are interesting static and dynamical crossover effects , as a function of the size of the system or of the time , that we study in details in this paper .",
    "we find that rejuvenation and memory effects are present , _ in embryo _ , in the sinai model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the sinai model . in section iii",
    "we analyze the statics of the model . in section",
    "iv we discuss the dynamics , first by studying aging in the correlation length and then by studying the a.c .",
    "susceptibility during temperature cycles . in section v we give the conclusion derived from our analysis .",
    "the sinai model belongs to a wider class of random potential models .",
    "it describes the dynamics of a point particle under the action of a random , uncorrelated force field @xmath10 which models several physical situations @xcite , such as the motion of domain wall in the random field ising model @xcite , or the motion of a dislocation kink .",
    "more recently , this model was argued to be relevant to describe some tapping experiments in sandpiles @xcite and the unzipping transition of dna @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the effective potential acting on the end point of the disordered directed polymer in 1 + 1 dimensions is also of the sinai type @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , the effective potential itself becomes temperature dependent , and the role of temperature changes in the directed polymer is much more subtle @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will study the discrete sinai model where each site corresponds to a different state or configuration with energy @xmath11 .",
    "the system consists of a box of length @xmath6 in which we generate a random potential .",
    "each sample of the random potential is constructed as follows : at each site @xmath12 $ ] , we generate a random gaussian force @xmath13 with zero mean and variance @xmath14 . all along this paper , we have taken @xmath15 in the numerical simulations .",
    "the potential in each site is the sum of the forces in the previous sites @xmath16 , and is thus a _ random walk _ as a function of the position",
    ". thus correlations ( and equivalently barriers ) grow like : @xmath17 this model has no thermodynamic transition so that in the limit @xmath18 , the physics is dominated by the @xmath19 glassy fixed point @xcite . as is obvious from eq.([eq5 ] ) , a rescaling of the length by a factor @xmath20 is equivalent to a change of the scale of the potential by a factor @xmath21 , or of the temperature by a factor @xmath22 . as far as the statics are concerned",
    ", this means that being at low temperature in a small system is equivalent to having a larger system but a higher temperature . for thedynamics",
    "a change in temperature leads to both a change in length scales and timescales .",
    "our aim is to investigate how the thermodynamic properties of the sinai model change when comparing the same system at two different temperatures . in order to probe the change in the free - energy landscape we have studied two different quantities , ( i ) the correlation function of the free - energy fluctuations at different temperatures and ( ii ) the correlation of the particle position .",
    "more precisely , we have studied the following observables :    * free - energy correlations : it consists in measuring the free energy fluctuations of the system at different temperatures averaged over the disorder : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the free energy at temperature @xmath25 and @xmath26 stands for the average over different realizations of the potential .",
    "this quantity was originally proposed by fisher and huse @xcite to study temperature chaos in the directed polymer problem .",
    "the fact that this correlation tends to zero with the size of the system shows that different energy valleys contribute to the total free - energy at different temperatures .",
    "more recently this quantity has been used to study the chaotic properties in the rem @xcite , and in the directed polymer problem when different type of perturbations are introduced @xcite , or for directed polymers on a hierarchical lattice @xcite .",
    "* fluctuations of position : a more geometrical way to visualize ` temperature chaos ' which could be of direct interest in some cases , for example the zipping and unzipping problem of dna @xcite , is to consider the following quantity .",
    "to each site @xmath27 , we associate a position @xmath28 and compute : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the thermal average at temperature @xmath25 , and @xmath31 is the disorder average .",
    "+ the study of the distance between average positions corresponding to different temperatures gives us an indication of the distance between states contributing to the partition function @xmath32 at different temperatures .",
    "if typical states contributing to @xmath32 at @xmath0 and @xmath2 are completely different , then @xmath33 will remain finite as @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath33 has an upper bound @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the value reached if the occupied sites are completely uncorrelated .    both quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 have been studied in the rem @xcite to show that even if the energy landscape is fixed ( in the sense that there is no reshuffling associated with the different valleys as temperature is changed ) , the model exhibits temperature chaos around the critical temperature , where the boltzmann weight ` condensates ' into a finite number of sites . because there is no finite temperature transition in the sinai model",
    ", one only observes mild effects under a temperature change , that are maximum around the crossover temperature @xmath39 ( see below ) .",
    "numerically we have investigated how these quantities behaves as a function of @xmath6 for different temperature changes .",
    "we have averaged over 2000 potential samples of sizes ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the thermodynamics of the sinai model has been well studied @xcite . in the large @xmath6 limit temperature",
    "is irrelevant .",
    "the system is frozen or localized in the minima of the potential , so that physical observables are governed by the ground state and its fluctuations .",
    "the free - energy grows as @xmath42 independently of temperature and the entropy reaches an @xmath6-independent value which depends on temperature @xmath43 .",
    "the free - energy fluctuations are also essentially dominated by the fluctuations of the deepest valley at any temperature .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that in the thermodynamic limit a change in temperature has no significant effect on physical observables since the ground state properties are temperature independent .",
    "+ the finite size corrections to the thermodynamic behaviour enter through the variable @xmath44 .",
    "corrections are important when @xmath45 , or @xmath46 , signaling the crossover between two different limits :    * @xmath47 : energy differences are much smaller than the temperature , so that all the sites contribute to the partition function .",
    "* @xmath48 : energy differences and barriers are huge and the particle is localized ; only a few sites within the deepest valley contribute significantly to the partition function .",
    "this crossover is clearly observed in the behavior of the fluctuations of the mean position ( in units of @xmath6 ) : @xmath49    in figure [ dxx ] we show the results for different temperatures versus the scaling variable @xmath50 defined above .",
    "the small @xmath50 behavior can be computed using a high - temperature expansion of the partition function : @xmath51 as we can see in the figure , the behavior for small @xmath50 matches nicely this prediction . for large @xmath50",
    "the system is completely governed by the @xmath19 behavior , thus average position fluctuations should approach the fluctuations of the ground state position . in figure [ dxx ]",
    "we also plot the ground - state position fluctuations as a function of @xmath9 , that converges towards @xmath52 .",
    "numerically we can see that this crossover takes place at @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath54     plotted versus the scaling variable @xmath55 for @xmath56and@xmath57 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the position fluctuations at zero temperature . for small @xmath50",
    "we have plotted the high temperature prediction @xmath58 .",
    "[ dxx],title=\"fig : \" ] 0.05 in    this static crossover can be mapped to the dynamical crossover from a brownian diffusive regime to an activated regime as we will see in the analysis of the correlation length in section [ lcorr ] .",
    "as we can see from the inset in figure [ cf ] , the free - energy correlations are a non - monotonous function of @xmath6  . for small @xmath6",
    "the free - energy at different temperatures start decorrelating but at a certain length , @xmath59 , @xmath37 reaches a minimum . then , it starts increasing back and reaches @xmath60 when @xmath34 regardless of the temperature difference ( provided it is finite ) as expected .",
    "one can distinguish between two different regimes :    * @xmath61 + for small system sizes / large enough temperatures the energy landscape is essentially flat , so that all the sites contribute to @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , in this regime a high temperature expansion is expected to yield the correct behavior of @xmath37 .",
    "the result is the following : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "* @xmath64 + in this limit the system is governed by the ground state and its fluctuations , thus we expect that for @xmath34 the correlation is perfect .",
    "however when @xmath65 is large but finite , the free energy decorrelates slightly .",
    "the behavior in the large @xmath6 limit can be understood by very simple arguments .",
    "suppose that @xmath66 is small , and that the relative temperature change is also small : @xmath67 .",
    "using @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the entropy at temperature @xmath25 , one finds : @xmath70 note that this relation is also true for the fluctuating part @xmath71 of @xmath72 . substituting ( [ eq10 ] ) into the expression for @xmath37 and expanding for small @xmath73 ,",
    "we finally get : @xmath74 we show in appendix a that the entropy fluctuations tend to a numerical constant @xmath75 that we compute in the large @xmath6 in limit . thus recalling that free - energy fluctuations scale as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 can be computed from @xcite ,",
    "we finally find the following scaling behavior for @xmath78 : @xmath79 * crossover + the crossover between both regimes will take place at a certain length @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , which yields @xmath82 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath78 actually occurs for @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests the following scaling form for @xmath78 : @xmath84 with @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "the resulting scaling plot is shown in figure [ cf ] .",
    "this scaling is acceptable only when temperature differences are not too large , as one would expect .",
    "+ 0.05 in      in figure [ dxs ] we show the curves corresponding to the average distance shift @xmath33 defined by eq.([eq2 ] ) above , for several temperature differences .",
    "again we find that this quantity is a non monotonic function of @xmath6 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the behavior of both @xmath33 and @xmath37 is similar , and the same type of argument can be used for both quantities .    * @xmath89 + in figure [ dxs ] we can see that for large temperatures",
    ", @xmath33 increases with system size .",
    "this behavior can be explained by looking at a high temperature expansion .",
    "as shown in appendix b , we find in this regime @xmath90 .",
    "* @xmath91 + in the large @xmath6 region the behavior of @xmath33 should be governed by the ground state fluctuations .",
    "one starts from the relation : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the thermal average at temperature @xmath25 .",
    "this relation is derived from the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( @xmath94 ) and integrating it assuming @xmath95 . the main contribution to @xmath33 for",
    "small temperatures will come from two nearly degenerate valleys that are a distance @xmath96 apart . restricting the thermal averages to these two valleys ,",
    "one finds : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the distance between the two valleys , and @xmath99 is their energy difference , such that @xmath100 is a positive random variable of order unity . in order to obtain @xmath33 we have to compute @xmath101",
    "this average depends on the joint probability distribution of the excitations @xmath102 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the probability distribution factorizes as @xmath103 .",
    "therefore in the limit @xmath104 we have : @xmath105 recalling that @xmath106 is the rescaled distance @xmath107 , one expects @xmath108 .",
    "provided @xmath109 , one finally finds : @xmath110 * crossover + as for the free - energy correlation , we can extract a crossover length scale which separates both regimes .",
    "the crossover length that is obtained is @xmath111 , that coincides with @xmath80 in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "again , we can try a scaling formula : @xmath113 note that the functions @xmath114 and @xmath50 are quite different .",
    "this reflects the fact that that the two observables probe different mechanisms . in figure [ dxs ]",
    "we show the scaling plot for different pairs @xmath115 .",
    "notice that _ all _ the curves display the maximum at the same value of the scaling variable @xmath116 .",
    "0.05 in      the outcome of the numerical analysis of the sinai potential is clear : in the thermodynamic limit statistical properties are governed by the @xmath19 fixed point .",
    "this means that regardless of temperature , for large enough system sizes , the system only sees the free - energy valley associated to the global minimum .",
    "effectively this situation is equivalent to say that in this limit there is no chaos in temperature since the statistical properties are those of the minimum of the potential .",
    "+ this situation is very different from what happens in the directed polymer problem .",
    "this model , as well as the sinai model , has no thermodynamic transition .",
    "it only displays a low - temperature glassy phase . in a recent paper @xcite this model",
    "has been shown to be extremely sensitive to any perturbation leading to the vanishing of correlations between systems at different temperatures ( see also @xcite for a related discussion . ) in this model this is due to existence of anomalous large excitations which have a very low free - energy cost .",
    "these excitations cost a lot of energy @xmath117 but are very favored entropically , since @xmath118 , so that these two contributions may cancel to yield a low cost in free - energy . in the sinai model",
    "these anomalous excitations do not exist because the entropy is very small ( not extensive ) and never cancels the energy cost ( @xmath119 ) of such excitations .",
    "it is interesting to compare the above crossover lengths @xmath120 with the crossover length at each temperature @xmath121 .",
    "the maximum decorrelation takes place for a system size such that @xmath122 . in this case the system at @xmath2 is already localized whereas the system at @xmath0 is still delocalized .",
    "the strong influence of temperature shift in this case is a smeared out version of the infinite susceptibility found in the random energy model @xcite . in this case there is a true finite temperature phase transition , and not a mere crossover as in the sinai case . for larger system sizes , when @xmath123 , both systems are governed by the zero temperature fixed point and correlations increase .",
    "the dynamics of this model have been well studied , both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "single - time as well as two - time quantities have been analyzed . here",
    ", we study one observable of both types ; we define in particular an ` a.c .",
    "susceptibility ' that should be closely related to the analogous observable studied in spin - glasses .    in our simulations",
    "we have used boxes of length @xmath124 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamics has been simulated by the monte carlo method using metropolis algorithm . for each realisation of the random potential , in order to sample adequately the energy landscape we have considered all possible initial conditions ( @xmath124 ) and we have averaged over @xmath125 different histories for each starting point . the total number of samples used in temperature cycling experiments is around @xmath126 .",
    "we have analyzed two different quantities :    * the correlation ( or explored ) length : @xmath127 the brackets and overline mean that we average over both the @xmath128 histories and samples respectively .",
    "the initial condition is a uniform distribution equivalent to a quench from infinite temperatures .",
    "this correlation length only gives information about the ` large scale ' mechanisms and the temperature cycling effects on this quantity can be fully explained in terms of effective times . * in order to probe ` smaller ' length scales that are more sensitive to temperature changes , we have defined the following ` a.c . '",
    "susceptibility @xmath129 : @xmath130 where the average is taken over the probability @xmath131 that a particle is at position @xmath106 at time @xmath132 , with a uniform distribution of particles at time @xmath133 . in other words",
    ", we measure the typical extra distance travelled by particles during a time @xmath134 , weighted by the dynamical distribution at time @xmath132 . such a quantity was also considered in @xcite .",
    "our main interest in this section is to study the temperature cycling experiments which are carried out in spin - glasses that have shown striking rejuvenation and memory effects @xcite .",
    "our main goal here is see to what extent these effects are already present in the sinai model .",
    "we have performed numerically the standard temperature cycling experiment : quench from infinite temperature down to @xmath0 and let the system relax during @xmath135 ; then change the temperature to @xmath136 and let the system evolve during @xmath137 and finally go back to @xmath0 .",
    "we have studied cycles with positive and negative @xmath3 for several waiting times and frequencies .      the time evolution for the correlation length at different temperatures is shown in the left panel in figure [ x ] .",
    "the growth of the correlation length depends exclusively on a temperature dependent microscopic timescale @xmath138 .",
    "this timescale is related to the crossover between two different dynamical regimes @xcite : +    * @xmath139 : short time dynamics where no barriers are present , so that in this regime we have usual brownian diffusion @xmath140 .",
    "* @xmath141 : long time , activated dynamics , with an activation time which follows an arrhenius law with a typical barrier @xmath142  @xcite , leading to @xmath143 .",
    "the crossover takes place when barriers become comparable to temperature so that activation between valleys dominates the dynamics .",
    "this crossover is directly related to the static crossover found for position or free energy correlations from a high temperature regime ( no barriers ) to a ( thermodynamic ) low temperature regime ( see section [ t ] ) .",
    "the microscopic timescale can be thus identified with the time that typically the system takes to explore this static crossover length scale @xmath144 .",

    "the main observation here is that clear rejuvenation is observed , with an effective shift time that decreases as @xmath3 increases , as in the experiments .",
    "intuitively , this corresponds to the fact that since the potential is self - similar , the _ local _ dynamics probed by @xmath129 is not sensitive to the depth of the potential valley that is currently occupied .",
    "therefore , aging at @xmath0 has already selected some low - lying valleys , but the intra - valley dynamics is insensitive to this .",
    "this argument for rejuvenation based on a hierarchical energy landscape , and in the absence of temperature chaos has been put forward in @xcite , and has been confirmed numerically in the multi - level trap model in @xcite .",
    "lower frequencies , that correspond to larger length scales , are less easily rejuvenated , as expected , since the separation of time scales is not as sharp : see figure [ teffn ] , where we show the normalized effective waiting times as a function of both @xmath175 and @xmath181 . *",
    "when heating back the system to the initial temperature @xmath0 , some memory is observed . however",
    "( i ) when the temperature difference is not very large , some effective time , accounting for the period spent at @xmath2 , must be included , as in the experiments , and ( ii ) a strong transient ` memory anomaly ' is observed , even for quite large @xmath3 s ( see plots a and b in figure [ dtn ] ) .",
    "note that we have always observed this memory anomaly to be negative , i.e ; the reference curve is reached from below .",
    "this memory anomaly is defined as : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the susceptibility just before the quench and @xmath184 corresponds to the first possible measurement at frequency @xmath165 after heating back to @xmath0 . in figs .",
    "[ deltachi ] and [ deltachir ] the dependence of the memory anomaly on different parameters , including the frequency , is shown .",
    "[ deltachi ] plot we show how the memory anomaly varies with the time @xmath169 spent at @xmath2 , for a fixed @xmath185 and @xmath186 , for the largest @xmath3 . from the inset",
    ", we see that the larger @xmath3 , the smaller @xmath187 , which agrees with the interpretation that the strong rejuvenation effect found for large @xmath3 arises from the separation of length scales . on the plot in fig .",
    "[ deltachir ] we show how the memory anomaly depends on the frequency @xmath165 .",
    "since the susceptibility at @xmath175 itself depends on @xmath165 we plot the relative variation of the susceptibility with respect to @xmath188 at fixed @xmath189 . in the inset",
    "we show @xmath190 versus @xmath165 .",
    "note that @xmath191 is always negative and decreases with increasing @xmath134 . in @xcite ,",
    "sasaki et al .",
    "find that in the anomaly can be both positive and negative when one works in the vicinity of a transition temperature . in the sinai model",
    "we have not been able to observe such a positive anomaly . for smaller @xmath3 s these effects",
    "are blurred because length scale separation becomes weak .",
    "aging at different temperatures is cumulative and @xmath192 is also larger ( see fig [ dtn ] for the @xmath193 cycle ) . for these smaller @xmath3 s",
    ", we have found that the memory anomaly becomes non monotonous with frequency . * in the positive temperature cycle experiments + we have also observed that the third stage is completely independent of @xmath175 .",
    "heating back the system to @xmath2 erases the initial aging accumulated at @xmath0 .",
    "this is expected , since the dynamics at @xmath2 allows the system to leave the traps that it had slowly explored at @xmath0 .",
    "the new relaxation at @xmath0 is aged , but the age is only due to the effect of aging at @xmath2 .",
    "this is similar to the effect observed experimentally .",
    "in this paper we studied in detail the role of temperature shifts in the simplest model where the energy landscape is explicitely hierarchical , namely the sinai model .",
    "this model has both attractive features ( there are valleys within valleys in a strict self - similar sense ) , but also one important drawback : there is no phase transition so that the model , in the large - size limit , is effectively at zero temperature .",
    "therefore , in this limit , temperature shifts do not lead to interesting phenomena : entropy in this model does not play any role , so that excitations have an enormous free - energy cost and can not be favored by the temperature perturbation , contrarily to what happens in a closely related model , the directed polymer @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , for finite sizes / finite times , some interesting crossover phenomena qualitatively reproduce the spin - glass phenomenology . in particular , dynamical rejuvenation effects in the absence of temperature chaos are observed .",
    "this rejuvenation is ascribed to the local dynamics , which is insensitive ( due to the self similar nature of the potential ) to the particular valley that has been reached during aging at a higher temperature .",
    "still , the separation of time scales / length scales with temperatures is much weaker that in experimental spin - glasses @xcite , partly due to the rather modest time scales investigated in the present study .",
    "correspondingly , abrupt rejuvenation as the temperature is decreased and strict memory when the temperature is cycled can not be achieved .",
    "rejuvenation and memory are present _ in embryo_.    in a word , the sinai model is a smeared out version of the multi - level trap model studied in @xcite , where the sequence of critical temperatures is replaced by a gradual freezing in the details of the fractal landscape .",
    "one could have studied the effect of temperature shifts in a one dimensional potential with logarithmic correlations ( rather than linear , as in the sinai case ) .",
    "this model was studied in details in @xcite and was shown to exhibit a true transition temperature .",
    "we expect the resulting temperature shift phenomenology to be very close to that of the random energy model , explored in @xcite .",
    "an extension of this model , that has an infinite sequence of phase transitions , will be presented in the near future @xcite .    *",

    "in this appendix we compute the average entropy fluctuations of the sinai model in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "as we have already said in section [ fe ] these entropy fluctuations are constant in this limit . for this computation",

    "they compute @xmath194 obtaining that the laplace transform is @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 is the variance of the random force .",
    "this result implies that we can work in terms of a dimensionless partition function @xmath198 to obtain , @xmath199 since the energy of the absolute minimum is set to zero , the entropy fluctuations can be directly computed as , @xmath200 now in terms of the dimensionless partition function we have that @xmath201 , thus when computing fluctuations of averages over @xmath202 terms which depend on @xmath203 ( and thus on @xmath25 ) cancel to yield , @xmath204 which is a constant as we expected .",
    "this constant can be evaluated by computing the averages of @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "the starting point of the calculation is derrida s integral representation of the logarithm , @xmath207 when we perform the average of @xmath208 we obtain the laplace transform given in ( [ a2 ] ) thus @xmath209 this integral can be split into two parts , the exponential integral @xmath210    where @xmath211 is the euler constant , and the part with the bessel function , @xmath212 where we have used the wronskian property of the bessel functions @xmath213 adding this two contributions we obtain that the average entropy reads , @xmath214 to compute the average @xmath215 we have to evaluate the following integral , @xmath216 the contribution arising from the first three terms in the integral can be easily evaluated from expressions ( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) to obtain : @xmath217 the last term is somewhat more tricky and can be evaluated as follows , @xmath218 in the limit @xmath219 the integral can be taylor expanded yielding , @xmath220 where the terms of order @xmath221 do not contribute when we set @xmath221 to @xmath222 . hence we can evaluate expression ( [ a13 ] ) at @xmath223 to obtain , @xmath224 adding all the contributions and taking the double limit @xmath225 and @xmath219 we obtain the following result for @xmath226 , @xmath227 which finally yields the entropy fluctuation , @xmath228",
