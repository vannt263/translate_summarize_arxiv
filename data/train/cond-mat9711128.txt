    "a vortex line in a type - ii superconductor induces spatial variations of the order parameter , @xmath0 , and magnetic field , @xmath1 .",
    "these quantities can be studied , for temperatures close to @xmath2 ( the superconducting transition temperature ) , and on length scales greater than @xmath3 ( the zero temperature correlation length ) , by using the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory . when a single small defect or impurity is present , the vortex line can lower its free energy by positioning its core at the impurity site ; this effect is known as vortex pinning .",
    "recent work by thuneberg,@xcite and others,@xcite has shown how to correctly include into the gl framework a localized impurity potential which is not necessarily weak .",
    "the pinning energy@xcite and pinning potential@xcite have already been calculated in several situations ; such quantities are the principle ingredients of macroscopic pinning theories",
    ". however , the impurity will also influence the superconductor in other interesting ways , which can be observed experimentally , using microscopic probes .",
    "for instance , both the order parameter , @xmath4 , and magnetic field , @xmath5 , are altered near the impurity .",
    "these perturbations therefore provide important insight into the nature of pinning . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the calculation of the perturbations in @xmath4 and @xmath5 constitutes a non - trivial application of the thuneberg theory .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the changes of the order parameter @xmath6 , and magnetic field @xmath7 , due to the impurity , when a vortex core is placed on a defect . near the defect",
    "these quantities can be calculated analytically .",
    "away from the defect , @xmath6 decays exponentially over the correlation length scale , @xmath8 , while @xmath7 decays exponentially over the penetration length scale @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the appropriate gl theory , and set up the general equations for our problem .",
    "these equations , ( [ eq : def1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dea1 ] ) , are the main results of this section .",
    "they are a pair of coupled , linear , partial differential equations for the impurity - induced changes in the order parameter and vector potential .    in section iii we consider in particular the spatial region close to the impurity , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are largest .",
    "in this region we are able to derive explicit expressions for the perturbations  the simplicity of the result for @xmath7 is somewhat remarkable .",
    "( [ eq : dpsi2]-[eq : da2 ] ) contain our main results . in section",
    "iv we discuss the results , and estimate the magnitude of the perturbation effects . in the appendix",
    "we calculate , numerically , the gl solutions for vortices in the absence of impurities .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper we consider a superconductor with a spin singlet , isotropic ( _ i.e. _ @xmath10-independent ) energy gap .",
    "the gl free energy , in terms of the complex order parameter @xmath11 and vector potential @xmath12 , is given , in the absence of the impurity , by @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the gauge - invariant derivative , and the local magnetic field is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 can be evaluated by using the microscopic theory of a superconducting fermi liquid .",
    "the results are @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density of states at the fermi surface , and @xmath21 represents the fermi surface average of the square of the fermi velocity .",
    "note that @xmath16 can be more generally represented as a tensor @xmath22 .",
    "however , we have considered here the isotropic case , @xmath23 .",
    "it is convenient at this point to rescale our variables in order to simplify the following equations .",
    "we will measure lengths in terms of @xmath8 ( with @xmath24 ) , and will normalize the order parameter in terms of its bulk value , @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) , for a uniform superconductor .",
    "thus we define the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath27    when an impurity is located at @xmath28 , the ( dimensionless ) gl equation acquires an extra term:@xcite @xmath29 to understand this equation , several points should be borne in mind :    \\(1 ) the effect of an impurity on the normal state quasiparticles can be represented by a potential @xmath30 for scattering from @xmath10 to @xmath31 on the fermi surface . for simplicity , we take the potential to be of @xmath32-wave form , so that @xmath33 .",
    "the impurity parameter @xmath34 , which appears in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) , is defined as@xcite @xmath35 the quasiparticle scattering cross - section is then proportional to @xmath36 . in the present theory,@xcite",
    "a `` small '' impurity implies that @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the small parameter for the expansions which follow becomes @xmath38 .",
    "however there is no restriction on the magnitude of @xmath39 .",
    "note that we consider here a general fermi surface , subject only to the symmetry constraint @xmath23 .",
    "for an @xmath32-wave order parameter and for a fermi surface with at least orthorhombic symmetry , thuneberg has shown how to go beyond the assumption that the impurity potential satisfies @xmath33.@xcite with thuneberg s generalization , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) remains valid , provided that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) is generalized appropriately .",
    "\\(2 ) to derive the gl equation  ( [ eq : gl ] ) , we coarse grain a more microscopic theory,@xcite and so lose information on length scales shorter than @xmath40 . at the gl level , the small impurity appears as a @xmath41-function driving term .",
    "\\(3 ) eq .  ( [ eq : gl ] ) should be expanded to first order in our small parameter @xmath38 .",
    "this amounts to the following linearization procedure .",
    "we write @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) in the absence of the impurity ( _ i.e .  _ with @xmath47 ) .",
    "we then expand the left hand side of ( [ eq : gl ] ) to first order in @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and set this first order piece equal to the right hand side .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath50 then represent the parts of the gl solution proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "consistent with this linearization procedure , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) involves only the unperturbed terms @xmath51 and @xmath46 .    in the presence of",
    "the impurity , the ( dimensionless ) maxwell equation also picks up an additional term ( @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 equation ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) should also be linearized in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 evaluated to first order in these quantities and @xmath52 evaluated using @xmath51 and @xmath57 .    for a given @xmath58 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) constitute a pair of linear , coupled , differential equations for @xmath59 and @xmath50 . for an application of these equations in a simpler context ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "we now specialize , and apply eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) to the case of a single vortex line which is centered on an impurity at the origin .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath57 then represent the solutions of the @xmath47 gl equations , with a single vortex at the origin .",
    "these unperturbed vortex solutions are well - studied.@xcite ( some aspects of the computations are discussed in the appendix . )",
    "the following gauge choice is most convenient : @xmath61 where we have used polar coordinates @xmath62 and taken the vortex line to be along the @xmath63-axis.@xcite at large @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 , while in the limit @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants which depend on @xmath18 and @xmath16 through the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath70 .",
    "( @xmath68 and @xmath69 should be determined numerically , as described in the appendix . )    according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) , the impurity perturbations to @xmath71 and @xmath72 take on the following form : @xmath73 thus , the order parameter magnitude will depend on @xmath63 as well as @xmath64 .",
    "further , we find @xmath74 so , the magnetic field in the presence of the impurity will now have a @xmath75 component , in addition to a perturbed @xmath76 component .",
    "using the preceding definitions ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) , ( [ eq : a0 ] ) , ( [ eq : dpsi ] ) , and ( [ eq : da ] ) , we arrive at the following pair of coupled , linear , differential equations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 note that the magnitudes of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are determined by the @xmath41-function driving term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def1 ] ) , particularly through the impurity parameter @xmath34 . we also note that since the unperturbed vortex line has a vanishing current density at the impurity site , the explicit impurity term ( [ eq : j2 ] ) in maxwell s equation is zero .",
    "thus , the changes in the magnetic field are due solely to the changes in the order parameter caused by the impurity .",
    "the rather formidable set of equations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 simplifies greatly , at distances much closer to the impurity than @xmath8 ; in our rescaled variables , this means that the results of this section are meant to cover the region @xmath82 . recalling that @xmath83 and @xmath84 both vanish linearly as @xmath85 , the proper short distance versions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dea1 ] ) become @xmath86    one advantage of the formulation we have chosen is that the equations become decoupled in the following sense : we can now solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : def12 ] ) independently for @xmath80 , and then use this result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dea12 ] ) to find @xmath81 .",
    "remarkably enough , when the analytic form for @xmath77 is inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dea12 ] ) , a simple , analytic solution for @xmath78 may also be found , leading to a simple solution for @xmath87 .",
    "the following results are obtained : @xmath88",
    "eqs .  ( [ eq : dpsi2]-[eq : da2 ] ) are the main results of this paper .",
    "they reflect the changes in the order parameter , magnetic field , and vector potential due to the impurity .",
    "we now discuss important points concerning these equations :    \\(1 ) the results hold for distances from the impurity greater than @xmath3 , but less than @xmath8 .",
    "close enough to @xmath2 , this range of validity can be reasonably large , since @xmath89^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "furthermore , any anomalies which appear in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dpsi2]-[eq : da2 ] ) as @xmath90 are not physical , since these solutions are not valid at short distances .",
    "\\(2 ) the magnitude of the order parameter near the vortex core actually increases from its unperturbed value , when the impurity is taken into account .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that scattering from nonmagnetic impurities lowers the free energy cost of gradients of the order parameter.@xcite the situation is analagous to the case of a finite concentration of impurities , where the gl coefficient @xmath16 is reduced from its impurity - free value .",
    "\\(3 ) associated with the increase in @xmath91 , circulating vortex currents are also enhanced near the defect site , causing the @xmath76 component of @xmath92 to increase .",
    "we may estimate the largest deviation of the magnetic field from its unperturbed value , @xmath93 . to do this",
    ", we estimate @xmath94 at a distance @xmath3 from the impurity .",
    "note that in real units , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "if we take @xmath97 and @xmath34 to be of order one , we finally get @xmath98 it should be possible to test both the magnitude and temperature dependence of this prediction using a suitable microscopic probe.@xcite    \\(4 ) in spite of the local perturbations to the magnetic field , impurities do not affect the quantization of vorticity ; the net flux associated with a pinned vortex remains @xmath99 in the @xmath76 direction .",
    "however , the vortex field lines , which are parallel to @xmath76 for the unperturbed vortex , now acquire a new @xmath75 component near the defect .",
    "the perturbation to the magnetic field is largest inside a radius @xmath3 of the defect [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimate ] ) ] . at a distance of order @xmath8 from the vortex core ,",
    "the perturbation field lines begin to close on themselves .",
    "full screening of @xmath100 occurs at distances of order @xmath9 .",
    "note that neither the screening of @xmath100 , nor the decay of @xmath101 over length scale @xmath8 , can emerge from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def12 ] ) and ( [ eq : dea12 ] ) , since those apply only very near the impurity .",
    "this work was supported by the director for energy research , office of basic energy sciences through the midwest superconductivity consortium ( miscon ) doe grant # de - fg02 - 90er45427 .",
    "in section iv of this paper , an estimate was made for the magnitude of @xmath102 , near the defect site , for which it was found that @xmath103 . in general , many quantities calculated near the vortex core depend sensitively on the parameter @xmath104 , regardless of the presence of a perturbing defect . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there exists in the literature no general calculation of this important quantity , nor of the quantity @xmath105 . such a calculation",
    "is therefore presented here .",
    "the results are found to agree quite well with the approximate solution of clem.@xcite    using dimensionless variables , the equations satisfied by @xmath83 and @xmath84 become @xmath106 while the boundary conditions , appropriate for a vortex core located at @xmath107 , are @xmath108 when @xmath66 , and @xmath109 when @xmath110 .",
    "( [ eq : df0 ] ) and ( [ eq : da0 ] ) can not be solved exactly , in the general case .",
    "we therefore solve the equations numerically , for fixed values of @xmath111 . to characterize our results ,",
    "we show the resulting @xmath111 dependences of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in fig .  1 , with @xmath112 for a type - ii superconductor .",
    "the results of fig .  1",
    "reflect an exact treatment of the vortex , within the gl description .",
    "an approximate , but analytic , treatment has also be provided by clem.@xcite in this scheme , only the second gl equation ( [ eq : da0 ] ) is solved .",
    "this is accomplished by using the variational form @xmath113 , which permits an exact solution for @xmath114 .",
    "the gl free energy is then constructed for the vortex line , and minimized , in terms of the variational parameter @xmath115 .",
    "clem s model thus improves and regularizes the london vortex solution , by introducing a vortex core .",
    "indeed , the results for the quantity @xmath69 ( which emerges from the conventional london theory only through _ ad hoc _ regularization ) are quite impressive ; fig .",
    "1 shows clem s approximate , transcendental solution for @xmath69 , as well as its large-@xmath111 asymptotic behavior : @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is euler s constant .",
    "although the model is not designed to provide accurate information in the vicinity of @xmath8 , we may still use it to calculate @xmath68 as shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting that the outcome has the correct qualitative behavior , but is slightly too large .",
