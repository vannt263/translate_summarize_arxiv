    "the theoretical analysis of these processes is hampered by the difficulty of computing the optical properties of nanostructured metals .",
    "standard techniques capable of providing virtually exact results to maxwell s equations can nowadays only treat either very small systems or systems with a high degree of symmetry . in this way",

    "nevertheless , approximate methods are required when computing either the optical transmission through finite arrays of holes , or the scattering coefficients of spps impinging on finite structures . regarding the scattering properties of spps ,",
    "several approaches have been developed in order to study collections of 1d scatterers ( i.e. with translational symmetry in one direction)@xcite . in the 2d case ( holes , protrusions , dimples ... ) the available theoretical formalisms",
    "are based on the coupling of dipoles , an approximation that is only valid when the dimensions of the scatterers are much smaller than the wavelength ( specially when , as usual , the polarizability of the scatterer is represented by its quasi - static value)@xcite .",
    "our first main goal is to present a method for treating the electromagnetic properties of up to thousands of _ indentations _ in a real metal .",
    "we apply this formalism for computing ( i ) how much energy goes into the different spp channels when an array of holes is back illuminated ( see ( a ) ) , and ( ii ) the scattering coefficients of spps by finite arrays of 2d indentations ( see ( b ) )",
    ".    the indentations can be either holes or dimples ( i.e. holes closed at one end ) , with arbitrary size and shape , placed at arbitrary positions .",
    "our approach is based on a modal expansion of the fields in different spatial regions .",
    "it is a non - trivial extension from the formalism previously developed for dealing with either 1d indentations in a real metal @xcite or 2d indentations in a perfect electrical conductor ( pec ) , where em fields can not penetrate @xcite .",
    "the model we shall present has already been applied to computing the plasmon coupling efficiency of a single defect ( both with circular and rectangular shape ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was used for calculating the optical transmittance through different systems : a single rectangular hole @xcite , a periodic array of rectangular holes @xcite , and a finite array of circular holes @xcite .",
    "excellent agreement was obtained in all these cases with both experimental results @xcite and fdtd simulations @xcite ( when available ) . however , no detailed account of its derivation has been presented before .",
    "our second main goal in this paper is to analyze the results on launching and decoupling of spp by metal gratings reported in @xcite .",
    "these experiments motivate our choice of geometrical parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "is devoted to presenting the theoretical framework used in the manuscript . in order to facilitate the reading , in",
    "we give an overview of the method and define the quantities studied throughout the paper .",
    "the derivation of the formalism as well as several useful expressions are given in the appendixes .",
    "in we present the optical response of a single circular hole ( illuminated by either a plane wave or a spp ) , while in we look at the scattering coefficients for arrays of circular holes .",
    "we consider a set of indentations ( either holes or dimples ) of arbitrary shape , and arbitrarily placed in a planar metal film ( infinite in the x - y plane and having finite thickness @xmath0 ) . the system can be divided in the three regions shown in .",
    "region i and region iii are dielectric semi - spaces characterized by the real dielectric constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "region ii represents the corrugated metal film with a wavelength - dependent dielectric function @xmath3 .",
    "holes or dimples could also be filled with a dielectric @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the system is illuminated by em wavefields coming from region i.    we expand the em fields on the eigenmodes of each region , and match them at the boundaries .",
    "the finite dielectric constant of the metal is taken into account by using surface impedance boundary conditions ( sibcs ) @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the results obtained with the sibcs can be understood as a second order taylor expansion in @xmath5 .",
    "the first order term ( @xmath6 ) is the result obtained within the pec approximation , and was reported in @xcite .",
    "the use of sibcs does not simply represent a quantitative improvement over results obtained with the pec approximation : it also allows for the computation of scattering of spps ( which do not exist in flat pec interfaces but already appear when sibcs are employed ) .",
    "notice however that sibc can not describe tunneling of em fields directly across the metal .",
    "therefore our method is only applicable to metal thickness larger than 2 - 3 skin depths , when direct tunneling is negligible . a cautionary remark : when dimples are considered , this restriction in thickness should be applied from the bottom of the dimple rather than from the metal surface .    .",

    "the spectral dependence on the ratio @xmath9 is shown in panel ( c).,width=453,height=226 ]    after some algebraic manipulations we end up with the following coupled system of equations for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are essentially the modal amplitudes of the electric field at the input and output interfaces of the indentations , respectively ( @xmath12 is an index labeling each waveguide mode in each indentation considered in the calculation ) .",
    "@xmath13    details of the derivation , as well as the expressions for the different quantities involved can be found in [ app : ose ] .",
    "let us just mention that the ingredients required for the calculation are the spatial dependence of waveguide modes in each indentation , and their propagation constants .",
    "these modes are analytically known for some hole geometries ; otherwise they can be numerically computed solving a 2d problem . in this section",
    "we just give the physical meaning of the different quantities in .",
    "@xmath14 represents the direct illumination over waveguide mode @xmath12 .",
    "it is proportional to the overlapping of the incident electric field with the mode in the indentation .",
    "the rest of the terms take into account the ( self - consistent ) wandering of fields between the indentations .",
    "@xmath15 is related to the bouncing back and forth of a given waveguide mode inside an indentation , due to the discontinuity that the waveguide mode faces at the end of the indentation .",
    "the main difference between holes and dimples is the presence of @xmath16 , which only appears for holes , and is related to the em field on one side of the hole due to the presence of an em field on the other side .",
    "the coupling between different waveguide modes is given by the `` propagator '' @xmath17 .",
    "this takes into account that the em field emitted by each point within object @xmath18 can be `` collected '' by the object @xmath12 .",
    "the propagator @xmath19 differs from @xmath17 in the constituent parameters only , i.e. @xmath20 is a function of @xmath2 while @xmath17 depends on @xmath1 .",
    "notice that this formalism is reminiscent of the green dyadic approach @xcite . in that method the em fields must be computed in the volume _ inside _ the indentations .",
    "in contrast , our method provides the em fields everywhere in terms of the fields _ at the openings _ of the indentations .",
    "this very compact representation allows for the treatment of the optical properties of systems involving a large number of indentations , at a relatively low computational cost @xcite .    .",

    "panel ( a ) shows the spectral dependence of the normalized - spp - emittance @xmath7 , while panel ( b ) renders the normalized - transmittance @xmath8.,width=453,height=226 ]    the price we pay is that the modal expansion formalism is approximate and relies on the sibcs , while the green dyadic method is virtually exact .",
    "the implementation of modal expansion calculations usually faces another source of inaccuracy .",
    "the required overlaps between plane waves and waveguide modes are only known for some waveguide geometries _ defined in a pec_. nevertheless with some minor corrections , waveguide modes in a pec can still yield good agreement with experimental results ( and exact calculations , when available ) .",
    "for instance , using the propagation constant of the waveguide in a real metal greatly improves the prediction of the spectral position of resonances .",
    "another improvement is to enlarge the hole side , so as to simulate the real penetration of the field at the lateral wall defining the waveguide .",
    "doing so , our method has provided good agreement with the fdtd simulation for the optical transmission through a single rectangular hole @xcite . in that case",
    ", the hole was enlarged as proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will only consider circular indentations , for which the propagation constant of waveguide modes in a real metal can be easily computed @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the waveguide modes are borrowed from those of a circular waveguide in the pec @xcite .",
    "the radius of the hole is phenomenologically enlarged by one skin depth .",
    "such enlargement provides the best agreement with fdtd simulations for an infinite periodic array of holes @xcite .",
    "as said before , once the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known , it is possible to obtain the fields everywhere . in particular , the energy power scattered into different channels can be computed by integration of the relevant time - averaged components of the poynting vector .",
    "we define @xmath22 as the total radiated power crossing a fictitious plane placed at constant z in region i. the definition of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the same as @xmath22 , except the appropriate fictitious plane is placed in region ii and iii , respectively .",
    "notice that we are maintaining the notation used in the system of equations , where primed quantities refer to region iii .",
    "the values of these quantities in terms of the set @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be found in [ sec : tw ] . in a real metal",
    ", em energy power can also leave the system as a spp wave .",
    "we define @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the energy power in the spp channel that crosses an ideal cylinder with axis parallel to the @xmath27 direction , placed in either region i or iii , respectively . details and expressions for these quantities",
    "can be found in [ sec : sw ] .",
    "we shall present results in terms of _ normalized _ emittances @xmath28 , defined as the total power @xmath29 divided by both the incident power impinging onto the area covered by indentations in region i , @xmath30 , and the total number of holes in the system @xmath31 . in other words , for each scattering channel we define a corresponding emittance as @xmath32 , independently of whether the incident field is a spp or a radiation field .",
    "however , when illumination is via a spp , @xmath30 is defined as the total power crossing the infinite imaginary strip perpendicular to the metal surface , whose base coincides with the maximum geometrical cross section of the collection of indentations .    for a lossy system",

    "it is not convenient to place the origin on the center of the array since the spp wave may not even reach the center for large arrays and strong spp scattering .",
    "hence , we place the origin at the center of the first column of indentations encountered by the incident spp and analyze the response of different arrays at the same distance @xmath33 from this origin , irrespectively of the array size . therefore ,",

    "let us close this section by reminding that current conservation imposes relations that are useful for checking the correctness of both the derived expressions and the computer codes .",
    "for instance , if absorption is neglected , the identity @xmath47 should be fulfilled , i.e the fraction of the incident energy traversing the hole , @xmath48 , must be either radiated into freely propagating waves , @xmath8 , or scattered into spp at the output side of the metal film , @xmath49 . on the input side",
    "we have a similar relation , which now depends on whether the incident field is a plane wave or a spp .",

    "let us first consider back - illumination of the hole by a plane wave , impinging at normal incidence .",
    "the optical transmittance through a single hole perforated in a real metal has been largely studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in general , the transmittance is characterized by fabry - prot peaks , one of them being very broad and appearing close to the cutoff wavelength of the fundamental waveguide mode @xcite .",
    "the previously cited theoretical works have looked at the spatial dependence of scattered fields , finding that a hole launches spps .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no computation has yet been performed on the efficiency of the spp launching by a back - illuminated hole ( ref . @xcite",
    "considered the coupling into the spp channel _ at the interface of incidence _ ) .",
    "we have performed such calculation , analysing the scattered em arising from the spp pole in the green dyadic ( see [ sec : sw ] ) .",
    "this analysis is possible even in the presence of absorption , although in lossy metals the actual em fields at the metal surface decay with the distance from the hole due to the dissipation of spp energy into heat .    renders the ( normalized - to - area ) fraction of incident energy that is scattered by a circular hole into either the spp ( @xmath7 , panel ( a ) ) or radiation ( @xmath8 , panel ( b ) ) channels .",
    "both quantities are computed in the region of transmission .",
    "the metal considered is gold , whose dielectric constant is fitted to palik s data @xcite .",
    "the film thickness is @xmath0=150 nm , and different hole radii are studied . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume a freestanding metal film since the peak investigated in the experiment concerns the metal - air interface . as shows ,",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 present non - monotonous spectral dependencies , due to a broad resonance appearing close to the cutoff wavelength of the fundamental waveguide mode , @xmath51 . for gold ,",

    "notice that spectra are plotted from @xmath52 600 nm , because far from @xmath53 nm results are not reliable because the sibc approximation breaks down(i.e @xmath54 is not longer fulfilled in that regime ) .",
    "however , in the considered spectral window , as much as 30% of the energy impinging into the holes can be converted into spps .",
    "\\(c ) shows that the ratio @xmath9 is a smooth radius - dependent function of wavelength . for the parameters considered ,",
    "this ratio is of the order of 0.3 - 0.8 , being larger for smaller holes . in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath55 )",
    "this ratio can be worked out analytically ; we find that @xmath56 for a metal represented by a drude dielectric constant .",
    "this decrease of the coupling to spps with wavelength originates from the weakening of the spp confinement to the surface , which translates into a weaker coupling to indentations .    in our formalism",

    "let us consider now the decoupling of spps into radiation , after they have been scattered by either a hole or a dimple ( see scheme in ( b ) ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this problem is virtually unexplored .",
    "we are only aware of a study on spp scattering by a shallow dimple with a gaussian profile @xcite",

    "the radius is @xmath61125 nm .",
    "several values of @xmath0 are considered ( @xmath0 is the metal thicknesses in the case of a hole , and the depth of the indentation in the case of a dimple ) .",
    "the inset of ( b ) renders the ratio @xmath37 ( notice that this is the inverse of the quantity shown in ( c ) ) .",
    "this ratio depends on the radius of the indentation , but does not depend neither on @xmath0 nor on whether the indentation is a hole or a dimple . for the considered case this ratio is always larger than unity , implying that a single hole scatters better into radiation than back into spps .",
    "also shows that a hole and a dimple couples spps into radiation with similar intensity , provided the indentation is deep enough .",
    "dimples may provide higher values of @xmath60 than holes , due to the lack of radiation into region iii .",
    "however , shallow holes radiate more than dimples .",
    "this is trivial when @xmath62 since the dimple then disappears .",
    "we find that , in the subwavelength regime , @xmath63 is a rough rule of thumb for the depth at which the scattering of spps into radiation is the same for dimples and holes of the same size",
    ". for smaller @xmath0 , conversion of spps into radiation is substantially smaller for a dimple than for a hole .",
    "notice though that this `` transition '' depth depends on the evanescent decay of the fields inside the indentation , and therefore on wavelength .",
    "for instance , a hole illuminated by a spp at @xmath52800 nm radiates 35% more than a dimple , when both have @xmath64150 nm .",
