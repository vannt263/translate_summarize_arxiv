    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) 054069.3 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is well known for its bright central pulsar ( psr b054069.3 ) and its pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) which show similar characteristics to those of the crab .",
    "the pulsar and pwn have been extensively studied at many wavelengths ( e.g. , middleditch & pennypacker 1985 ; manchester et al .",
    "1993a , b ; gotthelf & wang 2000 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; petre et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "snr 054069.3 is also one of the two known members of `` oxygen - rich '' snrs in the lmc . in the optical band ,",
    "early data of 054069.3 showed a ring - like ( @xmath04@xmath3 in radius ) [ o iii ] feature around the pulsar / pwn , which is identified as the o - rich ejecta @xcite .",
    "the spatial and spectral structures of the optical filamentary features in this region were studied using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations , which revealed the details of the ejecta and the synchrotron nebula @xcite .",
    "the filamentary features of the optical line emission were suggested to result from magnetic rayleigh - taylor instabilities due to the interaction between the expanding synchrotron nebula and the surrounding ejecta , just like those seen in the crab @xcite .",
    "this central region was also thoroughly studied in infrared ( ir ) using the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "these observations revealed that the central nebula of 054069.3 is analogous to that of the crab , showing synchrotron emission from the pwn , a complex network of ejecta filaments , and newly formed dust .",
    "a progenitor mass of 2025 @xmath4 was suggested based on the observed metal ejecta abundances @xcite .",
    "the enhanced optical and ir emission most likely originates from the interaction between the pwn and the freely - expanding metal - rich ejecta .    besides the central pulsar and pwn , the snr shell produced by the interaction between the blast wave and the surrounding medium was detected in the radio band @xcite .",
    "the radio spectral index in the outer shell ( @xmath5 = 0.41 , where @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ) is steeper than that in the pwn ( @xmath5 = 0.25 ) , which indicated that the shell emission is synchrotron radiation from the shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the age of snr 054069.3 has been estimated to be @xmath9 @xmath0 7601660 yr based on various methods such as the pulsar spin - down , the kinematics of the optical ejecta , and the overall dynamics of the ejecta evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "thermal emission from the snr shell ( @xmath01@xmath10 in diameter ) has been detected in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the overall snr morphology of the nearly circular shell with the bright w and faint e regions is consistent with that of the radio images .",
    "the bright w filaments are roughly coincident with the patchy [ o iii ] emission feature at @xmath030@xmath3 w of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the detection of these outer filaments , which most likely originate from interactions between the blast wave and ambient medium , in x - rays and radio makes 054069.3 observationally distinguished from the crab in which no emission features from the blast wave significantly beyond the pwn are detected at any wavelengths .",
    "thermal emission from the outer snr shell is detected prominently in x - rays , and thus x - ray observations of 054069.3 provide a unique opportunity to study the ambient and/or circumstellar structures in this snr as well as the reverse shocked metal - rich ejecta .",
    "previous x - ray studies of the snr 054069.3 with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ produced puzzling results .",
    "enhanced line emission from o , ne , and fe was claimed by van der heyden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on the _ xmm - newton _ rgs data , but was not detected based on the _ chandra _ observation @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission lines detected by _ xmm - newton _ in the w regions of the snr are strongly blue - shifted ( @xmath11 @xmath0 2370 km s@xmath12 , van der heyden et al .",
    "2001 ) , which was not evident in the _ chandra _ data @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data suggested an intriguing possibility of the presence of nonthermal x - ray emitting `` arcs '' in the e and w boundaries @xcite , which are reminiscent of the nonthermal filaments of synchrotron radiation from the shock - accelerated cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons in several galactic snrs such as sn 1006 .",
    "however , the nature ( thermal vs. nonthermal ) of these faint arcs could not be determined with the previous _ chandra _ data because of the poor photon statistics .",
    "chandra _ data also detected a hard tail ( @xmath13 @xmath14 3 kev ) in the observed x - ray spectrum which appears to prevail in the eastern _ hemisphere _ of the snr @xcite .",
    "the origin for the hard tail ( a thermal plasma with @xmath15 @xmath0 5 kev vs. power law [ pl ] continuum with @xmath16 @xmath0 2.7 ) was uncertain @xcite . while the previous _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data revealed a number of new properties of snr 054069.3 , some results were inconclusive and/or controversial .",
    "the uncertainties and discrepancies in the previous x - ray results appear to be caused largely by the poor photon statistics in the _ chandra _ data ( a 28 ks exposure ) and/or the poor angular resolution ( @xmath01@xmath10 ) of _ xmm - newton _ rgs @xcite .",
    "motivated by these discrepancies , we performed a deep _ chandra _ observation to address the outstanding issues and to reveal the true nature of snr 054069.3 .",
    "here we report the results from the data analysis of our deep 120 ks _",
    "observation of snr 054069.3 .",
    "we focus on our spectral analysis of the diffuse x - ray emission features outside of the pwn .",
    "the spectral analysis of the pwn will be presented elsewhere . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we describe the observations and the data reduction .",
    "we present the spectral analysis of the snr in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we discuss the results and implications in section  [ sec : disc ] , and present a summary in setion  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we observed snr 054069.3 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board _ chandra x - ray observatory _ during ao6 ( in 2006 february 1518 , obsids 5549 , 7270 , and 7271 ) .",
    "we used the acis - s3 for the effective detection of the soft x - ray emission of the snr .",
    "the previous _ chandra _ observation of 054069.3 ( obsid 119 ) showed significant photon pileup effects in the central regions of the pwn @xcite . to reduce the pileup effects in the pwn as much as possible while covering the entire snr , we chose a 1/4-subarray of the acis .",
    "we corrected the spatial and spectral degradation of the acis data caused by the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ; townsley et al .",
    "2000 ) using the methods developed by townsley et al .",
    "we applied the standard data screening by status and grade ( _ asca _ grades 02346 ) . since our observation was split into three segments ( @xmath040 ks exposure for each segment ) , we performed these data reduction steps on individual observations .",
    "the three data sets were then merged into a single event file by re - projecting them onto the obsid 5549 s tangential plane .",
    "after the data reduction , the effective exposure was 114.2 ks .",
    "the archival _ chandra _ data of 054069.3 ( obsid 119 ) were obtained with a significantly shorter exposure ( 28 ks ) , and the results of the data analysis have been published @xcite . since the low photon statistics of these archival data did not significantly enhance the statistics of our new data analysis , we used only our new deep observation in this work .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1]a shows an x - ray color image of snr 054069.3 .",
    "the central region is dominated by emission from the bright pulsar psr b054069.3 and its pwn . the bright x - ray emission from the pulsar results in the trail image running ne - sw",
    "( corresponding to the ccd s read - out direction ) .",
    "we excluded this trail region ( @xmath02@xmath175 width ) in the spectral analysis .",
    "snr 054069.3 is projected on complex diffuse background structures @xcite .",
    "we tested several nearby source - free regions for the background spectrum .",
    "although regions to the s and w of the snr show generally higher background emission ( by @xmath020% in the total count rates ) than regions to the n because of the relatively bright soft background emission ( @xmath13 @xmath18 1.5 kev ) there , the selection of different background regions does not have a significant effect on our snr spectral analysis . in this work , we use an average background spectrum extracted from four circular regions ( @xmath015@xmath3 in radius ) to the ne , nw , se , and sw of the snr ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .    thanks to the use of the 1/4 subarray of the acis - s3 , our new observation of snr 054069.3 shows reduced photon pileup effects in the pwn region . based on simple tests using the event grade distribution and the count rate changes in the snr between observations in 1999 and 2006",
    ", we find that regions with radial distance @xmath19 @xmath20 3@xmath3 from the pulsar are nearly free from pileup effects ( regions within @xmath19 @xmath21 2@xmath3 are still significantly piled up . )",
    "the o - rich ejecta detected in the optical band shows a shell - like morphology with a radius of @xmath19 @xmath0 4@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , using the pileup - free data , we can perform a reliable spectral analysis of this region to search for x - ray counterparts for the optical o - rich ejecta . however , the central regions of the snr , which are spatially coincident with the optical ejecta features , are dominated by the bright pwn in x - rays .",
    "we find no evidence for enhanced x - ray emission features from the o he@xmath22 and/or o ly@xmath22 lines at r @xmath0 4@xmath35@xmath3 .",
    "this result confirms the conclusions inferred by the previous data @xcite .",
    "we here concentrate our spectral analysis on the faint e - s regions , bright w filaments , and the faint e arc . in all spectral fits presented in the following sections",
    ", we binned each regional spectrum to contain a minimum of 20 counts per energy bin .",
    "small arc - like filaments on the e and w boundaries of the snr were discovered by the previous _ chandra _ data @xcite . as hwang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) noted , this particular morphology and the hard x - ray spectrum of these features raised the intriguing possibility of strong particle acceleration sites at the shock front of 054069.3 , in analogy to the `` bi - polar '' nonthermal x - ray filaments in the galactic historical snr 1006 .",
    "in fact , hwang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that a significant portion of the x - ray emission in these arcs could be nonthermal continuum in origin .",
    "however , because of the poor photon statistics ( e.g. , @xmath0190 counts in the arc region in the e boundary ) , the true nature of these features could not be revealed by the previous _ chandra _ data . with a four times deeper exposure ,",
    "we obtain significantly better photon statistics from these arcs to study the spectral characteristics .",
    "we note that the w arc region is projected on the bright thermal emission features of the snr .",
    "also , the trail image by the pulsar is partially superposed onto the w arc ( figure  [ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "the spectral analysis of the w arc is difficult and less useful than the e arc due to these complex environments and the detector artifacts .",
    "in fact , our two - component spectral model fits ( plane shock + pl ) for the w arc result in nearly the same spectral parameters for the hard pl component ( @xmath16 @xmath0 2.4 , @xmath23 @xmath0 4 @xmath24 10@xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath12 ) as those for the e arc ( see below ) . because the soft thermal emission dominates the overall w arc spectrum , the best - fit pl parameters are poorly constrained compared to those in the e arc .",
    "thus , we discuss the nature of the arcs based on the spectral analysis of the e arc ( the `` arc '' region in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the arc region contains @xmath0750 counts and is well - separated from the bright thermal filaments , as well as avoiding contamination by the pulsar trail image .",
    "the arc region shows a featureless x - ray spectrum which can be fitted by a pl model with @xmath16 = 2.42@xmath27 ( uncertainties are with a 90% confidence level , hereafter ) .",
    "we fixed the galactic absorbing column at @xmath28 = 7 @xmath24 10@xmath29 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we fit the foreground column in the lmc ( @xmath30 = 6.5@xmath31 @xmath24",
    "10@xmath32 @xmath26 ) , assuming lmc interstellar abundances @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the arc region and the best - fit pl model ( @xmath33 = 39.8/31 ) are presented in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] . the plane - parallel shock model with lmc abundances",
    "can not fit the observed spectrum ( @xmath33 = 2.8 ) . when the individual metal abundances are varied , the fit results in a large column ( @xmath30 @xmath0 1.9 @xmath24 10@xmath34 @xmath26 ) and a high electron temperature ( @xmath15 @xmath0 2.3 kev ) .",
    "the fitted abundances are negligible for most species except for o ( @xmath05 ) and ca ( @xmath04 , abundances are with respect to solar [ anders & grevesse 1989 ] , hereafter ) .",
    "the fitted lmc column is implausibly large for this location of the lmc .",
    "the inferred overabundances for o and ca are statistically insignificant due to large uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit model ( @xmath33 = 35.0/22 ) is significantly poorer than the pl model fit . a two - component model ( pl + plane shock ) indicates only a small contribution ( @xmath05% of the total flux ) from the thermal plasma ( @xmath15 @xmath0 0.4 kev ) .",
    "the pl + plane shock model does not improve the overall fit ( @xmath33 = 36.7/28 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the x - ray emission in the arc region is dominated by nonthermal pl continuum .",
    "the best - fit photon index ( @xmath16 @xmath0 2.4 ) is consistent with the typical value for synchrotron radiation by relativistically accelerated electrons in the strong sn shock .    assuming that synchrotron radiation from the shock - accelerated electrons is responsible for the x - ray and radio emission for the arc , we fit the observed arc spectrum with the synchrotron cutoff model ( srcut , reynolds 1998 ; reynolds & keohane 1999 ) .",
    "we fixed the radio spectral index at @xmath5 = 0.41 as estimated for the entire snr excluding the central pwn @xcite .",
    "the best - fit lmc column , @xmath30 = 5.7@xmath35 @xmath24 10@xmath32 @xmath26 , is consistent with that measured by the pl model fit .",
    "the fitted synchrotron roll - off frequency is @xmath36 = 1.0@xmath37 @xmath24 10@xmath38 hz .",
    "our x - ray spectral analysis indicates that the 1 ghz flux for the radio counterpart is @xmath39 @xmath0 0.19 mjy . on the other hand , based on the 1.5 and 5 ghz images @xcite",
    ", we roughly estimate @xmath39 @xmath0 7 mjy for the arc region .",
    "this radio flux is significantly larger than our estimate from the x - ray spectral fit , which suggests that the radio spectral index may not be uniform across the snr .",
    "thus , we repeated the srcut model fit of the arc region by fixing @xmath39 = 7 mjy while varying the radio spectral index @xmath5 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath30 = 5.7@xmath40 @xmath24 10@xmath32 @xmath26 , @xmath36 = 2.1@xmath41 @xmath24 10@xmath38 hz , and @xmath5 = 0.62@xmath420.01 .",
    "the best - fit radio spectral index is not unusual for galactic shell - type snrs @xcite .",
    "based on the pl and srcut model fits , the observed x - ray flux ( absorbed ) of the arc is @xmath23 @xmath0 3.7 @xmath24 10@xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath12 . at the distance of @xmath43",
    "= 50 kpc for the lmc ( @xmath43 = 50 kpc for snr 054069.3 is assumed in this paper hereafter ) , the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity is @xmath44 @xmath0 1.7 @xmath24 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the best - fit model parameters for the arc region are summarized in table  [ tbl : tab1 ] .",
    "we note that the estimated absorbing column to the arc can be reliably assumed for other regions of snr 054069.3 because it is measured by straightforward models ( pl and srcut ) of the simple continuum - dominated spectrum .",
    "in fact , our spectral fits for the central region ( @xmath19 = 4@xmath35@xmath3 , the `` ring '' region in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) also indicate @xmath30 = 6.0@xmath420.5 @xmath24 10@xmath32 @xmath26 .",
    "this central region is close to the pwn , in which the observed spectrum is dominated by the simple pl continuum and provides significant photon statistics ( @xmath03600 counts ) , while the pileup effects are convincingly ruled out .",
    "we find that other regional spectral analysis requires more complicated thermal spectral modelings which result in less reliable estimates of @xmath30 ( e.g. , hwang et al . 2001 ) .",
    "thus , based on the results from the spectral analysis of the arc region , we fix the lmc column at @xmath30 = 6 @xmath24 10@xmath32 @xmath26 in the following spectral analysis of the snr .",
    "this @xmath30 value is somewhat higher than those estimated / adopted in previous works ( @xmath46 @xmath0 45 @xmath24 10@xmath32 @xmath26 , e.g. , kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; petre et al .",
    "the higher @xmath30 is justified by the realistic assumption of the lmc abundances in our absorption model , while the previous works assumed the solar abundances .",
    "our @xmath30 is fully consistent with that estimated by serafimovich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who also assumed the lmc abundances for the absorbing column by the lmc .",
    "the eastern half of the snr is generally faint , and x - ray emission appears to originate from a hot plasma of the electron temperature @xmath15 @xmath0 5 kev @xcite . however , the previous results on the faint eastern regions were rather preliminary based on a simple spectral analysis of the integrated spectra from the `` inner '' and `` outer '' regions of the entire eastern half of the snr .",
    "the inner parts of the eastern half of the snr could be substantially contaminated by scattered photons from the bright pulsar and pwn .",
    "the outer regions of the eastern half show an intensity variation with a relatively bright emission in the north .",
    "furthermore , our new deep _",
    "data reveal that x - ray emission near the southern boundary , which was included in the `` outer east '' region by hwang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , is spectrally - soft ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "thus , we carefully re - analyze the faint e region excluding the relatively bright n regions and the spectrally - soft s regions .",
    "we also exclude the central regions of @xmath19 @xmath21 20@xmath3 to avoid the contamination from the pulsar and pwn as much as possible ( our radial cut to remove the pwn is more conservative than that by hwang et al . [",
    "2001 ] who excluded regions of @xmath19 @xmath47 7@xmath3 . )",
    "based on our marx simulations of the pulsar / pwn of 054069.3 , we estimated that the contamination by scattered photons from the pulsar / pwn due to the broad psf wings of the mirror is @xmath02030 % in the observed 37 kev band flux for the `` e '' region ( as shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "in these simulations , we assumed our observed acis image of the pwn ( @xmath19 @xmath47 4@xmath3 ) with a pl spectrum of @xmath16 = 2 and the 110 kev band flux of 3.2 @xmath24 10@xmath48 erg @xmath26 s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the scattered photons is hard ( a pl with @xmath16 @xmath0 0.25 ) at these large radial distances of @xmath19 @xmath0 20@xmath330@xmath3 from the pulsar .",
    "thus , this instrumental artifact contaminates primarily at @xmath13 @xmath20 5 kev .",
    "we fixed this scattered photon flux spectrum in the spectral model fits of the e region .",
    "( the broad psf wing flux was estimated in the annular region of @xmath19 = 20@xmath330@xmath3 using our marx simulations , and was then normalized for the area of the e region .",

    "the x - ray spectrum of the e region includes @xmath01600 counts .",
    "the overall spectral characteristics are consistent with those shown for the `` outer east '' region in hwang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : the soft band spectrum evidently shows x - ray line emission features , and the hard tail extends to @xmath13 @xmath14 4 kev .",
    "initially , we fit the observed spectrum with a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plane - shock model ( borkowski et al . 2001 ; vpshock in conjunction with the nei version 2.0 in the xspec ) that is based on atomdb @xcite .",

    "if the hard x - ray emission is nonthermal , the estimated pl photon index suggests synchrotron radiation for its origin , which is similar to that detected in the arc region .",
    "if the hard emission is thermal , the hot gas implies an ambient density of @xmath109 @xmath0 0.170.35 @xmath26 which is several times lower than that estimated in the western regions ( @xmath109 @xmath0 1.43 @xmath26 ) .",
    "the w regions are dominated by bright soft filamentary emission features representing the shocked high density medium of lower electron temperatures ( @xmath15 @xmath0 0.5 - 1.5 kev ) .",
    "metal abundances in the w regions are low ( @xmath21 0.3 ) , indicating interstellar and/or circumstellar origins rather than metal - rich stellar ejecta .",
    "our spectral analysis of thermal x - ray emission features indicates high shock velocities ( @xmath69 @xmath0 20009000 km s@xmath12 ) which are usually expected in young snrs where particle acceleration is efficient .    in the s boundary of the snr",
    ", we detect a faint emission feature which shows a distinctively soft x - ray spectrum compared to the surrounding regions .",
    "the fe abundance in this region appears to be enhanced , although the detection of the fe overabundance is not conclusive because of the low photon statistics in the currrent data and the incomplete fe l line models for highly under - ionized thermal plasma .",
    "if it is confirmed by follow - up high statistics data and improved nei models , the suggested fe - rich ejecta candidate at the outer boundary of the snr is intriguing .",
    "it would be the detection of fe ejecta created in the deepest core of the sn and subsequently expelled to nearly the outer blast wave just like those seen in cas a. deeper _ chandra _ observations and improved fe l line models for significanly under - ionized plasma are required to reveal the true nature of this candidate fe - rich ejecta and its implications on the core - collapse nucleosynthesis and the details of the explosion mechanism .",
