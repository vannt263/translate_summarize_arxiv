    "the @xmath1 model@xcite attempts to unify the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions in the smallest simple group .",
    "it has many attractive features which are well recognized , however it suffers from a few major difficulties which are actually generic to the idea of grand unification@xcite itself .    1 .",
    "because quarks and leptons reside in unified multiplets and there are b- and l - violating interactions , gauge boson exchanges can result in proton decay@xcite .",
    "if these gauge bosons are appropriately heavy , the decay rate will be very small .",
    "their masses , in the usual formulation , are , however , not arbitrary but rather determined by the scale where the different gauge couplings unify .",
    "the proton decay lifetime is therefore a robust prediction of the model .",
    "no experimental signature of proton decay@xcite has been found yet and the model is disfavoured .",
    "more complicated unification models involving several intermediate mass - scales can evade this problem@xcite .",
    "the low energy higgs doublet , responsible for electroweak breaking , is embedded in a * 5 * representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the other members of this multiplet are color triplet scalars which must have a mass near the unification scale and no such scalars have been observed at the electroweak scale .",
    "this leads to an unnatural mass splitting among the members of the same @xmath1 multiplet .",
    "this is termed the double - triplet splitting problem@xcite .",
    "3 .   the non - supersymmetric version does not have a natural dark matter candidate@xcite .",
    "neutral members of @xmath1 particle spectram decay quickly .",
    "these unwelcome features of the @xmath1 model can be tackled in an elegant way if unified @xmath1 symmetry exists in a 5-d world .",
    "low energy 4-d @xmath2 symmetry is recovered when the extra dimension is compactified on a @xmath3 orbifold@xcite .",
    "this situation is realized when space - time is considered to be factorized into a product of 4d minkowski space - time @xmath4 and the orbifold @xmath5 .",
    "the coordinate system consists of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "there are two distinct 4-d branes ; one at @xmath8 and another at @xmath9 . on the @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11=0 is identified with @xmath12 while @xmath13/2 are identified with each other ..    as in usual su(5 ) model , fermions are put into @xmath14 plet and the @xmath15 plet .",
    "we assume , as is common , that the fermions are fixed in the 4-d brane at @xmath8 whereas gauge bosons and the scalars penetrate inside the bulk .",
    "the discrete @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetries , permit the expansion of any 5-d field @xmath18 in the following mode expansions according to whether they are even or odd fields . @xmath19",
    "in this scheme @xmath20 higgs has been excluded . instead of using higgs mechanism",
    ", we use orbifold properties for breaking @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "@xmath21 has + parity and @xmath22 has - parity under @xmath16 .",
    "further more ( 3,2 ) and ( @xmath23,2 ) components of @xmath24 has negative @xmath17 parity .",
    "c c c & * @xmath16 * & * @xmath17 * @xmath25 ( 1,1)+(1,3)+(8,1 ) & + & + @xmath26 ( 3,2)+(@xmath23,2 ) & + & - @xmath27 ( 1,1)+(1,3)+(8,1 ) & - & - @xmath28 ( 3,2)+(@xmath23,2 ) & - & +    in other words @xmath16 can distinguish between usual 4-d and the extra fifth component of @xmath29 ( 5-d gauge field ) , whereas @xmath17 can distinguish between sm gauge bosons and the extra su(5 ) gauge bosons .",
    "thus @xmath17 assignments break su(5 ) symmetry , because a mass splitting among 24 gauge bosons are introduced . out of 24 ,",
    "12 have mass - less modes but remaining 12 do not .",
    "we choose @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the radius of fifth dimension .",
    "therefore gut scale is same as compactification scale .",
    "it was noted by dienes , dudas and gherghetta@xcite , that if fermions are restricted to orbifold fixed points , all @xmath17 odd type wave functions , such as @xmath32 and @xmath33 gauge bosons will vanish at orbifold fixed points .",
    "thus there is no coupling of @xmath32 and @xmath33 gauge bosons to low energy quarks and leptons , forbidding proton decay .",
    "later on , altarelli and feruglio@xcite noted that the absence of tree level amplitudes can provide an explanation of present negative experimental results .",
    "they also noted that even - though the idea of forbidding proton decay by a suitable discrete symmetry is not new , its physical origin is clear in the present context .     and",
    "@xmath33 gauge bosons can not couple to fermions as they have negative @xmath34 parity .",
    "this makes the proton stable . ]",
    "our model has only @xmath35 plets of higgs fields . from eqn .",
    "[ eqn1]- eqn .",
    "[ eqn4 ] , we see that only @xmath36 has a mass - less mode . therefore ,",
    "once we include one 5-dimensional @xmath35 plet , one remains mass - less whereas the triplet has a mass of the order of the gut scale .",
    "similarly for ` @xmath37 ' numbers of 5-dimensional @xmath35 plets , ` @xmath37 ' numbers of remains mass - less at low energy .",
    "@xmath38      let us define new quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 coefficients range @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 coefficients are defined as , @xmath44 there are three equations and three unknowns . solving for the unknowns we get , @xmath45 because @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 . for the case of @xmath48 we get , @xmath49 therefore we see that this simple model predicts one doublet at the @xmath50 scale plus eight more doublets at around @xmath51 tev .",
    "therefore this is a . obviously , this model is very interesting from the point of view of collider physics phenomenology . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we have plotted the unification scenario our case has the label ( 8,0,0,0 ) .",
    "more general cases can be found in the reference @xcite which also discusses the present case in detail .    .",
    "as a first approximation we have used one intermediate scale which is given by the mass scale of extra scalars allowed by @xmath52 compactifications . ]",
    "there is proton decay non - observation problem in conventional guts .",
    "there is also doublet triplet splitting problem in conventional guts .",
    "these two problems can be solved if su(5 ) symmetry exists in a 5-d world .",
    "the simplest model containing only * 5 * plets has nine doublets @xmath53 at low energy . if we count the number of fermions in standard model , there are @xmath54 quarks and @xmath55 leptons .",
    "therefore the total number of fermions are nine per generation",
    ". perhaps we have one doublet for each of them .",
    "it is an interesting puzzle .",
    "we have compactified the fifth dimension on a @xmath56 orbifold .",
    "these extra symmetries can make the proton quite stable .",
    "this type of model being non - supersymmetric , there is no r - parity violating proton decay .",
    "there is no neutrino mass in this model .",
    "however we can add heavy right handed neutrinos in the gut scale .",
    "this is a heavy right handed singlet fermion of mass @xmath57 gev or so .",
    "then via see - saw mechanism one can produce a small majorana mass of the order of @xmath58 here , we can see that , in our case @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we can make an order of magnitude estimate of the neutrino mass , @xmath60 we should study kaluza - klein type dark matter in this model .",
    "the lightest kaluza - klein state with ( at - least one ) negative parity could be stable and its lifetime can be comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath16 parity is the same for all multiplets of @xmath61 . only the @xmath17 changes .",
    "therefore is @xmath16 redundant ?",
    "we have kept it here even though it is of no use @xmath62 .",
    "this is because if we want to construct the supersymmetric version of the theory , we may have to use it .",
    "one can study @xmath63 unification in this model .",
    "the simplest way is to couple only one doublet to fermions .",
    "however all nine doublets contribute to gauge coupling unification . at last",
    "let us comment on the 5-d planck scale where quantum gravity becomes non - negligible , @xmath64 for our case , @xmath65 gev and @xmath66 gev , therefore the 5-d planck scale is at @xmath67 we see that the planck scale is higher than unification scale as expected .",
    "this result follows from our requirement that gut scale and 5-d compactification scale should be one and the same .",
