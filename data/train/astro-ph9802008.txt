    "the age - metallicity relation of a stellar system is one of the fundamental diagnostics through which we can learn about the chemical enrichment processes that occur during the system s evolution . within the solar neighbourhood for example",
    ", it is possible to determine the age - metallicity relation for the galactic disk from the ages and metallicities of field stars ( e.g. , edvardsson _ et al .  _ 1993 ) , and modelling of this relation and its scatter suggests a complex evolution involving gas inflow and the radial diffusion of orbits in the presence of a radial abundance gradient ( e.g. , pagel & tautvaisiene 1995 ) .",
    "however , for more distant systems , we can no longer use individual f- and g - type dwarfs to determine ages and abundances .",
    "instead we must use star clusters since , at least in principle , it is relatively straightforward to determine a cluster s age and abundance . in particular , for our nearest galactic neighbors it is possible to constrain cluster ages via main sequence turnoff luminosities even if the clusters are as old as the galactic halo globular clusters .",
    "thus provided clusters of all ages can be found , which is of course a function of formation and destruction processes , the age - metallicity relations of these nearby systems can be fully outlined .",
    "it is with this proviso , however , that a major difficulty often arises .",
    "for example , in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) there is a well established population of old metal - poor star clusters whose properties are comparable to the galactic halo globular clusters ( e.g. , suntzeff _ et al .  _ 1992 ) .",
    "there is also a large population of intermediate - age clusters , but the ages of these clusters are all less than 3  4 gyr ( e.g. , da  costa 1991 , olszewski _",
    "_ 1996 , geisler _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) and only a single cluster , eso  121-sc03 ( mateo _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) is known to fall in the `` age gap '' between the old and intermediate - age objects . as emphasized by olszweski _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1996 ) , for example , this gap in the lmc cluster age distribution also represents an `` abundance gap '' , in that the old clusters are all metal - poor while the intermediate - age clusters are all relatively metal - rich ( olszewski _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) , approaching even the present - day abundance in the lmc .",
    "yet because of the lack of clusters older than @xmath03 gyr , we have essentially no constraints on the timescale for what was the major enrichment event in the lmc s history .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , on the other hand , is known to have a different distribution of cluster ages from the lmc ( e.g. , da  costa 1991 ) . in particular , while the number of clusters with ages determined from main sequence turnoff photometry is smaller than for the lmc , there is no sign in these data for any substantial `` age gap '' .",
    "thus , in principle , the smc age - metallicity relation defined by the star clusters can cover from the present day back almost to the age of the oldest galactic halo globular clusters .",
    "the smc age - metallicity relation , as it stood prior to the present work ( e.g. , stryker _ et al .  _",
    "1985 , da  costa 1991 , olszewski _",
    "et al .  _",
    "1996 ) had fundamentally two components .",
    "first , it appeared that following a presumed initial burst of star formation that brought the cluster abundances up to [ fe / h ] @xmath3 1.3 , the subsequent net rate of enrichment was very low until perhaps 2  3 gyr ago .",
    "second , commencing at an age of @xmath02  3 gyr , the rate of enrichment apparently increased to bring the cluster abundances up to the present - day smc abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0.6 dex .",
    "this sort of age - metallicity relation is very different from that of the solar neighbourhood and it also differs substantially from that expected from the simple model of chemical evolution . as summarized by dopita ( 1991 ) , the first component of this relation could be explained if the infall rate of unenriched gas matched the rate of chemical enrichment , or if the newly synthesized metals were lost in a strong galactic wind ( or a combination of these processes ) .",
    "the second component could result from the cessation of these processes , or from an increased star formation rate perhaps as a result of an interaction with the lmc .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that the majority of the cluster abundances used to define this age - metallicity relation are rather uncertain : most are derived from the color of the cluster red giant branch in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this technique depends on the reddening of the cluster and on the zeropoint of the photometry , and it also contains the uncertainty inherent in the calibration of a parameter that is sensitive to both age and abundance .    it is obvious then that to verify the chemical history of the smc implied by this age - metallicity relation , it needs to be redetermined using a consistent , accurate and reddening independent method .",
    "spectroscopy at the triplet of globular cluster red giants analyzed in terms of the magnitude difference from the horizontal branch is such a method ( see , for example , da  costa & armandroff 1995 , rutledge _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 and the references therein ) , and as olszewski _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1991 ) have shown , it can be extended to red giants in intermediate - age star clusters since the higher gravity of the younger stars has little effect , at least for ages in excess of perhaps 2 gyr .",
    "the purpose of this paper then is to present triplet spectroscopy for red giants in a number of smc star clusters and to discuss the implications of these new results for the smc age - metallicity relation and the smc chemical history .",
    "spectroscopy of individual stars has the added bonus that we can also determine the cluster radial velocities .",
    "the kinematics of the lmc cluster system has produced some intriguing results ( e.g. , schommer _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) and while the sample of clusters observed here is small , the velocity results can nevertheless be compared with the kinematics of other smc populations .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows : in the following section the sample of smc clusters observed , the data reduction procedure , and the line strength and radial velocity analysis techniques are described .",
    "section [ abund ] discusses in some detail the derivation of abundances from the observed line strengths .",
    "then , in the first part of , the kinematics implied by the cluster radial velocities are derived and compared with those of other smc populations with similar ages . in the second part of this section ( sect .",
    "[ amr ] ) the full smc age - metallicity relation is constructed .",
    "the implications of this relation for the chemical evolution of the smc are discussed in the final section .",
    "compared to the lmc , there are fewer well - studied star clusters in the smc , though as noted above , the smc clusters do not show the large `` age - gap '' exhibited by the lmc cluster population .",
    "for this reason we initially selected only those clusters with both good quality color - magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams and ages , as determined from main sequence turnoff photometry , greater than @xmath02 gyr .",
    "there are six such clusters : lindsay  1 ( olszweski _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , kron  3 ( rich _ et al .  _ 1984 ) , lindsay  11 ( mould _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , ngc  121 ( stryker _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) , ngc  339 ( olszewski , 1994 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , and lindsay  113 ( mould _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 ) . for each cluster",
    "the brighter half dozen or so candidate cluster red giants were selected for spectroscopic observation at the triplet . in this selection process",
    "we were careful to ensure that none of the stars chosen had been previously identified via ir - photometry and/or low resolution spectroscopy as upper - agb stars ( whether of c , m or s spectral type ) .",
    "then , in order to increase the sample , we constructed a second list of smc clusters for which main sequence turnoff color - magnitude diagrams were not available , but for which independent data suggested an age in the @xmath42 gyr to 12 gyr range .",
    "the only cluster in this second list for which stars were actually observed was ngc  361 .",
    "arp ( 1958 ) gives a photographic c - m diagram for this cluster but it does not reach as faint as even the expected magnitude for the core helium burning stars .",
    "it therefore yields little age information .",
    "however , when corrected for the effects of a superposed bright star ( cf .",
    "van den bergh 1981 ) the integrated @xmath5 colors of ngc  361 are similar to those of the six clusters in the first list .",
    "thus it is likely that ngc  361 is of intermediate - age , and the brighter red giants from the c - m diagram of arp ( 1958 ) were added to the sample for spectroscopic study .",
    "the program stars were observed with the anglo - australian telescope using the rgo spectrograph with the 25 cm camera and a tek 1k ccd , during runs in 1992 september ( second halves of five nights ) and 1994 august ( second halves of two nights ) .",
    "the instrumental setup was identical to that discussed in da  costa & armandroff ( 1995 , hereafter da95 ) which can be consulted for a more detailed description . in brief , the spectra cover the wavelength interval @xmath077009300   at a resolution of @xmath03 .",
    "total exposure times for the smc cluster stars ranged from 800 seconds to 2 hours for the faintest stars . wherever possible two stars were observed simultaneously by rotating the spectrograph slit to an appropriate position angle .",
    "standard iraf procedures were used to generate sky - subtracted wavelength - calibrated spectra from the raw data .",
    "some examples of the final spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "spectra of galactic globular cluster red giants obtained during these observing runs are discussed in da95 , who have demonstrated that the data from the two observing runs have no systematic differences and can be used interchangably . at this point",
    "it is also worth mentioning that lindsay 11 star 1 from mould & aaronson ( 1982 ) was also observed during the 1994 august run .",
    "this star has the infra - red colors of an upper - agb carbon star ( cf .",
    "mould & aaronson 1982 ) and the presence of strong cn - bands at @xmath6  and 8050  in the spectrum confirm this classification .",
    "such bands were not seen in the spectrum of any other star observed .",
    "there were also no indications in these spectra of tio bands whose presence can affect the measurement of the triplet line strength ( e.g. , olszewski _",
    "et al .  _",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the ( pseudo ) equivalent widths of the two stronger lines of the triplet , @xmath78542  and @xmath78662 , were measured from the red giant spectra by applying the gaussian fitting technique of da95 ( see also armandroff & da  costa 1991 ) .",
    "the sum of these line strength measures , denoted by w@xmath8+w@xmath9 , was then computed for each observation .",
    "final values for 33 stars in the fields of the 7 smc clusters are given in table [ data_tab ] . in this table",
    "the errors accompanying the w@xmath8+w@xmath9 values are those which result from the uncertainties in the parameters that define the gaussian line profile fits .",
    "comparison of these errors with the mean single observation error in w@xmath8+w@xmath9 derived from the 31 repeat observations of 15 stars shows that these gaussian line profile fit uncertainties probably overestimate the true errors by perhaps 25 percent ( 0.32  versus 0.40 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have been conservative and retained the individual gaussian line profile fit uncertainties .    for four of the seven clusters ,",
    "the available photometry is in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bandpasses , whereas the abundance calibration procedure ( cf .",
    "da95 ) requires @xmath12 magnitudes for both the individual stars and for the horizontal branch luminosity . to overcome this situation",
    "we have made use of the empirical transformation : @xmath13 this transformation is based on high quality photoelectric @xmath14 photometry of red giants in the galactic globular clusters 47  tuc , ngc  288 , ngc  362 , ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 ( e.  m.  green , 1987 , priv .  comm . ) and is appropriate for the reddening e(b  v ) = 0.04 mag assumed for the smc clusters .",
    "the rms deviation about the fitted line is only 0.010 mag and the equation is valid between @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath12 magnitude for each program star then follows from the observed @xmath10 magnitude and the computed @xmath19 color .",
    "the same process has also been used to fix the @xmath20 values for these clusters : the median @xmath21 color of the red clump of core helium burning stars ( which constitutes the horizontal branch in these clusters ) was converted to @xmath19 via equation ( 1 ) and combined with @xmath22 , taken as @xmath23 plus the median @xmath21 color , to generate @xmath20 .",
    "this process can be verified for two of the four clusters involved since independent @xmath24 photometry is available . for kron  3 ,",
    "the c - m diagram of gascoigne ( 1980 ) suggests @xmath20 @xmath3 19.3 while alcaino _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1996 ) list @xmath20 = 19.50 @xmath1 0.05 .",
    "both these values are in agreement with our adopted value of 19.44 derived from the @xmath25 photometry of rich _ et al .  _",
    "we note also that the lindsay  1 c - m diagram in gascoigne ( 1980 ) gives @xmath20 @xmath3 19.3 , again in good accord with our value @xmath20 = 19.20 adopted from the ( @xmath12 , @xmath19 ) photometry of olszewski _ et al .  _",
    "for ngc  121 , the photometry of tifft ( 1963 ) for zones 2 and 3 , which should be free of photographic background effects ( cf .",
    "stryker _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) , gives @xmath20 @xmath3 19.6 .",
    "this agrees well with the value @xmath20 = 19.60 derived from the @xmath25 photometry of stryker _",
    "et al .  _",
    "the adopted @xmath20 values for all the sample clusters ( except ngc  361 for which no suitable photometry exists ) are given in table [ results_tab ] .    in fig .",
    "[ w_vs_v ] the line strength measures are plotted against the @xmath12 magnitude difference from the horizontal branch , @xmath26 , for all stars observed in the fields of 6 of the 7 clusters in the sample .",
    "the lack of a c - m diagram reaching faint enough to reveal the magnitude of the horizontal branch ( or red clump ) in ngc  361 precludes analysis of the line strengths for this cluster .",
    "the galactic globular cluster calibration lines in this figure have been taken from da95 and the panels of this diagram provide one indication of the cluster membership status for each of the stars observed . since there is no reason to suspect that any of these clusters contain a substantial internal abundance range , we can assume that any star whose triplet line strength lies significantly away from those of the majority , is not likely to be a member of that cluster .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ w_vs_v ] shows that the star mjd240 in the field of lindsay  11 has such a discrepant line strength , while all other stars appear , on this basis at least , to be members of their respective clusters .",
    "an additional , and independent , means to investigate cluster membership status is provided by the comparatively large heliocentric velocity of the smc .",
    "the measurement of radial velocities from the observed spectra will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ rv ] , but for the moment we note that all stars except lindsay 11 mjd240 and ngc  121 sdm029 have radial velocities consistent with not only smc membership but also membership in their respective clusters .",
    "lindsay 11 mjd240 is apparently an smc field star while the low radial velocity of ngc  121 sdm029 indicates that this star is probably a foreground galactic star .",
    "this star , and lindsay  11 mjd240 , will not be considered further .    as shown by a number of authors ( e.g. , da95 , rutledge _",
    "_ 1997 , and the references therein ) , the slope of the relation between the line strength index w@xmath8+w@xmath9 and @xmath26 is independent of abundance , at least for @xmath26 @xmath27 0.5 mag .",
    "thus the individual line strength measures for the stars observed in a cluster can be combined into a single quantity , the reduced equivalent width , denoted by w@xmath28 .",
    "w@xmath28 can then be calibrated in terms of metal abundance .",
    "on the system of da95 which we follow here , w@xmath28 is defined as the mean value of the quantity w@xmath8+w@xmath9 + 0.62(@xmath26 ) for the stars observed in a particular cluster .",
    "since we have now established the cluster membership status of the program stars , we can compute w@xmath28 for each cluster .",
    "the resulting values are listed in table [ results_tab ] .",
    "we note that for the clusters lindsay  1 , kron  3 and ngc  339 , the cluster w@xmath28 value is simply the mean of the stellar values since the individual w@xmath8+w@xmath9 errors are all similar . for the other three clusters , however ,",
    "this is not the case and the value of w@xmath28 was computed as a weighted average , with the weights taken as the inverse square of the w@xmath8+w@xmath9 errors given by the gaussian line profile fit uncertainties for each individual star .",
    "we note also that the error listed with the w@xmath28 values in table [ results_tab ] contains not only the error , as expressed by the standard error in the mean , from the scatter of the individual values , but also includes the effect of an assumed @xmath10.10 mag uncertainty in the value of @xmath20 for each cluster .    for the three clusters where the value of w@xmath28 was computed as a weighted average , it is of interest to see if the values change significantly if different weighting schemes are adopted .",
    "consequently , we have computed values of w@xmath28 for these clusters for the case of no weighting , and for a weighting scheme in which the observed mean single observation error in w@xmath8+w@xmath9 ( 0.32  ) together with the number of observations per star was used to compute the weights .",
    "we find that in each of these cases , the values of w@xmath28 computed for the three clusters agree with those given in table [ results_tab ] to well within the uncertainties listed in the table .",
    "the uncertainties in the alternate w@xmath28 values are also comparable to those given in table [ results_tab ] except for the case of lindsay 113 and no weighting . here",
    "the outliers ( cf.fig .  [ w_vs_v ] ) , whose",
    "larger errors are ignored in this particular calculation , generate an uncertainty that is a factor of two larger than that listed in table [ results_tab ] .",
    "we believe , however , that the values listed in table [ results_tab ] are the appropriate ones to adopt . the relation between these w@xmath28 values and abundance will be discussed in section [ abund ] .      the determination of radial velocities from the spectra obtained in these observing runs has been discussed in detail in da95 .",
    "briefly , the program star spectra were cross - correlated with high s / n spectra of bright g- and k - type giant radial velocity standards . the velocity zeropoint for each run was set by minimizing , after applying heliocentric corrections , the difference between the observed and standard velocities for both the radial velocity standards and a number of galactic globular cluster stars with well determined velocities ( see da95 for details ) .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in the zeropoint of the velocity system is @xmath02  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "based on the repeat observations , the individual radial velocity determinations for our program stars have an average error of 6  km  s@xmath2 .    in table",
    "[ results_tab ] we give mean heliocentric velocities for the 7 smc star clusters observed .",
    "these means were calculated from the individual cluster star observations and the tabulated errors are the standard deviations of the mean for the samples .",
    "an external check on these velocities is provided by the cluster ngc  121 for which other radial velocity determinations exist .",

    "in their paper da95 give a calibration of w@xmath28 with abundance using [ fe / h ] values for galactic globular clusters that have their origin with zinn & west ( 1984 ) .",
    "there is an excellent correlation between w@xmath28 and [ fe / h]@xmath30 though it is not linear over the entire [ fe / h]@xmath30 range exhibited by the clusters .",
    "da95 chose to model the relation by two linear segments that join at w@xmath28 = 3.8  or [ fe / h]@xmath30 = 1.44 , finding a rms dispersion about the fitted lines of @xmath310.09 dex",
    ". there are , however , a number of issues that must be addressed before we can convert the smc cluster w@xmath28 values in table  [ results_tab ] to abundance , using a calibration such as that of da95 .",
    "the first of these is relatively straightforward .",
    "the definition of w@xmath28 uses the difference between the apparent magnitude of the red giant and that of the horizontal branch . in the da95 analysis , for example ,",
    "the @xmath20 values used are those of globular cluster core helium burning stars , i.e. , stars whose age is @xmath015 gyr .",
    "the majority of the clusters studied here , however , have ages considerably younger than the galactic globular clusters .",
    "now , as shown by , for example , the isochrones of bertelli _ et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) , at fixed abundance the luminosity of core helium burning stars becomes progressively brighter as age decreases or , more physically , as turnoff mass increases .",
    "for example , at an abundance of z=0.001 ( log z / z@xmath32 = 1.3 ) , the initial m@xmath33 of core helium burning stars at an age of 4 gyr is 0.28 mag brighter than it is at 15 gyr ( bertelli _ et al .",
    "thus the observed @xmath26 value for a red giant in a younger cluster is smaller than it would be in a cluster as old as the galactic globulars .",
    "failure to allow for this effect would give rise to an overestimate of the true cluster abundance with the difference systematically increasing with decreasing cluster age . consequently , for a given abundance calibration ( see below ) , we will tabulate two abundances for each cluster , one based on the observed value of w@xmath28 and a second derived from a corrected value of w@xmath28 . the correction to w@xmath28 comes from using the adopted cluster ages given in table [ results_tab ] with bertelli _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) isochrones of appropriate abundance to estimate the change in @xmath20 . an independent calculation of this effect using the models of seidel _ et al .  _",
    "( 1987b ) in conjunction with the revised yale isochrones ( green _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , as described in hatzidimitriou ( 1991 ) , gives essentially identical results .",
    "the second issue involves the fact that w@xmath28 is a _ calcium _ line strength index whereas the calibration is to [ fe / h ] values .",
    "as long as there is no difference in [ ca / fe ] between the program and calibration objects , this is not a matter for concern .",
    "however , calcium , being an @xmath34-element , has its origin primarily in sneii and is enhanced , relative to the solar ratio , in both globular cluster and metal - poor galactic halo stars ( e.g. , wheeler _ et al .",
    "iron enrichment , on the other hand , is thought to occur primarily from sneia which have a longer evolutionary time than sneii .",
    "thus the [ ca / fe ] ratio is quite likely to be a function of star formation and enrichment history . in particular ,",
    "a star in an smc cluster with an age half that , or less , of the galactic globular clusters is not likely to have the same [ ca / fe ] value as a galactic globular cluster star , even though they may have the same [ fe / h ] . at the present time",
    "we can do little about this issue other than to note first , that investigation of element abundance ratios in smc and lmc intermediate - age and old cluster and field stars is likely to be a prime science project for the coming 8 m class telescopes in the southern hemisphere , and second , that in young smc field stars the [ @xmath34/fe ] ratio is approximately solar despite the moderate overall fe depletion ( e.g. , hill 1997 , luck & lambert 1992 ) . as regards our own data ,",
    "two points can be made : first , interpreting w@xmath28 with a galactic globular cluster based relation ( i.e. , one for which [ ca / fe ] @xmath3 + 0.3 ) will lead to an _ underestimate _ of the true [ fe / h ] if [ ca / fe ] @xmath31 0.3 in the program stars .",
    "in such a case the derived [ fe / h ] values will represent lower limits on the actual abundance value .",
    "second , it would seem unlikely that clusters with comparable ages could have substantially different [ ca / fe ] ratios .",
    "thus the difference in w@xmath28 between lindsay  11 and ngc  339 , for example , is likely to reflect a significant difference in overall abundance .",
    "the final issue is that of the calibration relation itself .",
    "as noted above , in da95 the w@xmath28 calibration is tied to the globular cluster abundance scale of zinn & west ( 1984 ) . in a recent paper , however , carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) have compiled a consistent set of [ fe / h ] values derived from high dispersion spectroscopy for galactic globular clusters .",
    "these authors find that their [ fe / h ] values do not scale linearly with those of zinn & west ( 1984 ) .",
    "while there is reasonable agreement for both the metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 2.0 ) and the metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0.7 ) clusters , at intermediate abundances there are substantial differences ( carretta & gratton 1997 ) .",
    "for example , the `` standard clusters '' m3 , m13 and m5 have abundances on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale of 1.66 , 1.65 and 1.40 dex but have [ fe / h]@xmath35 = 1.34 , 1.39 and 1.11 , respectively , a difference of a factor of 2 in z.    further , rutledge _ et al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that the non - linear relation between w@xmath28 and [ fe / h]@xmath30 becomes linear when [ fe / h]@xmath35 is used instead .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ w_vs_feh ] where we plot the w@xmath28 values for the calibration clusters in table 4 of da95 against [ fe / h]@xmath35 .",
    "a single straight line fits the data over the entire [ fe / h]@xmath35 abundance range ( cf .",
    "rutledge _ et al .",
    "a least squares fit to these data then yields : @xmath36}_{\\rm cg97 } = ( 0.416 \\pm 0.018 ) { \\rm w}^{\\prime } - ( 2.748 \\pm 0.064)\\ ] ] the rms deviation in [ fe / h]@xmath35 about the fitted line is 0.07 dex .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) find a very similar relation .",

    "[ amr_plt ] is somewhat different from previous depictions of the cluster and field star data ( e.g. , stryker _ et al .  _",
    "1985 , da  costa 1991 , olszewski _",
    "et al .  _ 1996 ) principally as a result of the increased precision of our spectroscopic abundance determinations . leaving aside for the moment the two clusters ( lindsay  113 and ngc  339 ) with anomalously low abundances , the enrichment history for the smc indicated by fig .  [ amr_plt ] suggests a relatively rapid ( @xmath43 @xmath27 3 gyr ) initial abundance increase followed by a more modest rise starting at @xmath010 gyr and continuing until the present day .",
    "in particular , the previous requirement ( e.g. , da  costa 1991 ) for an increased rate of enrichment to bring the abundance from [ fe / h ] @xmath3 1.3 at approximately 3 gyr to the present - day value of [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0.6 is alleviated .",
    "indeed , the data of fig .",
    "[ amr_plt ] , again excepting lindsay  113 and ngc  339 , are now quite consistent with the predictions of the simple `` closed box '' model of chemical evolution . thus it is also no longer necessary to postulate the significant gas infall or strong galactic winds which were invoked ( e.g. , dopita 1991 ) to explain the apparent lack of enrichment from @xmath010  12 gyr to approximately 3 gyr .",
    "of course such processes , however , may still take place .",
    "the smc , with its likely past interactions with the lmc and the galaxy may well be an `` open '' rather than a closed box , but nevertheless simple models scaled to a present - day abundance , the current smc gas mass fraction ( taken as 0.36 , lequeux 1984 ) and a formation epoch , assumed to be at 15 gyr , give reasonable representations of the data .",
    "this is especially the case in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ amr_plt ] where we show simple models with present - day abundances of log  z / z@xmath32 = 0.6 and log  z / z@xmath32 = 0.5 dex .",
    "the scatter about the model curves is entirely consistent with the uncertainties in the data . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ amr_plt ] the same simple model curves are shown . here",
    "the fit is somewhat less satisfactory : the rate of enrichment from @xmath010  gyr to the present suggested by the observations being generally somewhat lower than the model predictions . or",
    "conversely , the rate of enrichment prior to @xmath010 gyr may have been more rapid than the simple model predicts .",
    "the model fits to the data in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ amr_plt ] could no doubt be improved by invoking infall , for example , but tighter constraints on the age - metallicity relation are required before such additional calculations would be meaningful .",
    "we now turn to the `` anomalous '' clusters lindsay  113 and ngc  339 .",
    "these clusters have abundances approximately 0.5 and 0.65 dex lower , respectively , than the simple model curves predict for their ages on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) abundance scale , or @xmath00.25 and 0.4 dex lower , respectively , using the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) scale0.2 dex present in the smc over at least the 5  10 gyr epoch .",
    "if it were not for ngc  339 , which lies further below the model line and which has an abundance difference of @xmath00.4 dex on the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) scale from the similar aged cluster lindsay  11 , such an interpretation might be plausible .",
    "however , we prefer to work on the assumption that the bulk of the smc population at any age less than @xmath010 gyr has only a small abundance range , and that therefore these two clusters are anomalous .",
    "additional data will , of course , eventually validate or refute this interpretation . ] .",
    "these clusters are considered anomalous since in dwarf galaxies like the smc , provided the star formation rate is relatively constant and the infall of external material insignificant , the expanding gas shells driven by evolving massive stars should throughly mix the interstellar medium over galaxy - wide scales on timescales that are considerably less than a hubble time ( e.g. , roy & kunth 1995 , see also kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ) . at the present epoch",
    "it does appear that the smc is chemically homogeneous .",
    "the studies listed above indicate that for both the young field stars and the regions the maximum abundance dispersion permitted by the observations is @xmath270.1 dex .",
    "further , while there has been considerable controversy in the past regarding the abundance of the young massive star cluster ngc  330 , recent work ( e.g. , hill & spite 1997 ) suggests that this cluster is only @xmath00.1 dex more metal - poor than field objects of comparable age , a minor offset . as regards the lmc , where there is a large population of intermediate - age star clusters , we can draw on the results of olszewski _ et al .  _",
    "( 1991 ) who also used triplet spectroscopy to determine abundances for a large number of lmc star clusters .",

    "( 1991 ) indicate that for the clusters in the age range 0.5 to 3 gyr , the inner ( r @xmath44 5  or @xmath04 kpc ) and outer clusters have `` apparently the same abundance spread , both of which are consistent with the measurement errors ( in ) our metallicities''(olszewski _ et al .",
    "thus there is no compelling case for a significant abundance spread among the lmc intermediate - age clusters .",
    "however , in the olszewski _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1991 ) sample , one can find relatively well observed clusters such as hodge  14 ( 5 observations of 3 stars , [ fe / h ] = 0.66 ) and ngc  1777 ( 3 observations of 3 stars , [ fe / h ] = 0.35 ) for which the results do suggest the existence of an intrinsic abundance range among the intermediate - age lmc clusters of size perhaps @xmath270.3 dex . but",
    "this abundance range is considerably less than that between the smc clusters ngc  339 and lindsay  11 ( @xmath45[fe / h ] = 0.66 @xmath1 0.17 on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) abundance scale , which is that used by olszewski _",
    "et al .  _ 1991 ; @xmath45[fe / h ] = 0.38 @xmath1 0.16 on the carretta & gratton 1997 scale ) , again pointing to the unusual nature of the two smc low abundance clusters .",
    "indeed these abundance differences are comparable in size to the _ full range _ in abundance seen in the galactic disk age - metallicity relation at comparable age ( edvardsson _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) .",
    "can we then offer an explanation for their anomalously low abundances ? we note first that lindsay  113 lies in the extreme eastern part of the smc some 4.2(@xmath04.2 kpc in projection ) from the center , while ngc  339 lies 1.5to the south .",
    "this might suggest an abundance gradient but in fact all the other clusters in our abundance sample are further from the smc center , at least in projection , than ngc  339 .",
    "in particular , lindsay  1 lies 3.4  to the west and does not appear anomalous .",
    "we can also use the age - compensated horizontal branch magnitudes to investigate any possible line - of - sight distance variations .",
    "these data suggest that kron  3 , lindsay  11 , ngc  121 and ngc  339 are at approximately the same distance , while lindsay  1 and lindsay  113 are perhaps @xmath00.3 mag closer .",
    "again it seems that a simple abundance gradient is not the answer .",
    "as for other explanations , a number of possibilities exist .",
    "roy & kunth ( 1995 ) , for example , suggest that large abundance discontinuities might arise in dwarf galaxies lacking significant differential rotation if there are long dormant phases between successive star forming episodes .",
    "this might appear an attractive possibility given the smc s apparent lack of rotation , but the existence of a relatively uniform age distribution for the smc star clusters with main sequence turnoff age determinations ( cf .",
    "[ amr_plt ] ) argues against the required long dormant phases .",
    "the remaining possibility is that the formation of these clusters involves the infall of unenriched , or at least less enriched , gas . given the extensive halo surrounding both magellanic clouds ( e.g. , mathewson & ford , 1984 ) and the existence of the magellanic stream , this possibility seems plausible .",
    "we note , however , that lu _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) have used absorption line spectroscopy of a background source to argue that the magellanic stream gas is certainly not of primordial",
    "( log  z / z@xmath32 @xmath27 2 ) composition .",
    "indeed the abundance limits are consistent with present - day magellanic cloud abundances ( lu _ et al .",
    "if these abundances are generally applicable to the magellanic stream gas , then it would seem to rule out the magellanic stream as the source of the low abundance gas involved in the formation of these clusters .",
    "however , lu _ et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) caution that the greatest uncertainty in abundance studies of this type is the sampling differences that can result from the narrow pencil beam of the absorption line data versus the large beam of the 21 cm data .",
    "since the column density can vary substantially on small scales ( cf .",
    "the high resolution smc map of stavely - smith _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 versus the earlier parkes data of , for example , mathewson & ford 1984 ) , the true abundances could differ substantially from the derived values .",
    "we note also that postulating a magellanic stream origin for the low abundance gas involved in the formation of these clusters requires that the stream have an age of at least 4 gyr .",
    "this conflicts with at least some models for the stream s origin ( e.g. , gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) .",
    "a further speculative possibility is that the gas from which lindsay  113 and ngc  339 formed ( presumably separately since the clusters have different ages ) contained a low abundance component which had been expelled in galactic wind at an early epoch , but which remained bound to the smc and which subsequently cooled and fell back ( cf .",
    "tenorio - tagle 1996 , burkert & ruiz - lapuente 1997 ) .",
    "a second speculative possibility is that the smc acquired these clusters in a past interaction much in the same way that the galaxy is now acquiring clusters from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , da95 ) .",
    "however , we note that among the dwarf galaxies of the local group , the only system known to contain star clusters of age similar to lindsay  113 and ngc  339 ( i.e. , @xmath04  6 gyr ) is the smc itself !    we conclude by noting that the chemical evolution of the smc , as exhibited by the data described here for old and intermediate - age clusters , is obviously quite complex .",
    "if we are to provide further constraints on the processes involved , then it is necessary to determine abundances ( and ages ) for additional smc star clusters .",
    "there are a number of candidate clusters ( e.g. , ngc  361 ) whose ages are likely to lie between 1 to 2 gyr and @xmath010 gyr . the results for such clusters would help enormously in clarifying whether the low abundances exhibited by lindsay  113 and ngc  339 are common , or are restricted to only a small fraction of smc cluster population .",
