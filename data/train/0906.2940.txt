    "<S> 99 , 256601 ( 2007 ) ] then allows us to determine the exchange coupling constant @xmath0 between the spins of the adsorbed molecules and those of the pb host . </S>",
    "<S> this approach gives rise to a general and reliable method for obtaining @xmath0 , by combining experimental and numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> strong correlation phenomena built the fundament of a number of extraordinary effects observed in condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most drastic manifestations is the kondo effect @xcite arising from strong coupling between single localized spins and the conduction electrons . for an antiferromagnetic - type interaction below the characteristic kondo temperature , @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , this coupling can not be treated perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> it comes along with the formation of a narrow peak in the density of states ( dos ) of a kondo adatom pinned to the fermi energy of the conduction electrons , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> its lineshape can be described by the well - known doniach - sunjic formula @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the kondo resonance has various physical consequences . in the context of the transport properties of bulk diluted magnetic alloys it manifests as enhancement of the resistance at low temperatures . in mesoscopic systems consisting of a single quantum dot coupled to a pair of one - dimensional leads @xcite it results in a drastic enhancement of the conductance below @xmath1 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a system which recently has attracted much attention , both from the experimental and theoretical side , is composed of a metallic host surface with a kondo adatom ( adsorbed atom ) and a stm tip , non- or ferromagnetic @xcite . contrasting the case of a single quantum dot coupled to leads , such a system demonstrates a much greater variety of transport regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the possibility of quantum interference between distinct transport paths , namely direct tip - host tunneling and indirect tip - adatom - host tunneling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the latter process gets extremely efficient for temperatures below @xmath3 due to the appearance of a kondo resonance in the adatom spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum interference mechanism leads to an asymmetry of the kondo resonance . instead of a lorentzian lineshape it acquires a fano - type lineshape , which is characteristic of interference between a discret level and a continuous spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the appearence of this kind of a fano - kondo resonance has been found in various experiments with nonmagnetic tips @xcite and has been discussed in a number of theoretical works @xcite .    in a recent experimental work </S>",
    "<S> the quantum size effect on the kondo temperature was investigated by y .- s .  </S>",
    "<S> fu et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system under study consisted of individual manganese phtalocyanine ( mnpc ) molecules absorbed on ultrathin pb films grown on si(111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> scanning tunneling spectroscopy shows asymmetric fano - kondo peaks in the differential conductance . </S>",
    "<S> one central implication of the work by y .- s .  </S>",
    "<S> fu et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that the variation of the film thickness , given by the number of pb monolayers ( mls ) , leads to drastic changes in @xmath1 , more specifically to pronounced oscillations with a period of 2 mls . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest ( 23 k ) and highest ( 419 k ) values occured at thicknesses of 15 and 17 mls , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> because the kondo temperature scales with the electronic dos at the fermi energy , @xmath4 , according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an amplitude and @xmath0 is the exchange coupling constant , this observation has been attributed to oscillations in the pb dos with the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for every 2 mls increase of the thickness one empty quantization band moves down below the fermi level and gets occupied @xcite .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we present a state - of - the - art ab - initio investigation of the electronic structure of pb films on a si(111 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> determining @xmath4 as a function of the film thickness and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tk ] we can perform a fit to the experimental data given in fig .  2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> besides the amplitude @xmath6 , the exchange coupling constant @xmath0 is the only fitting parameter and therefore can be obtained without any further assumption .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the augmented spherical wave approach , applying density functional theory within the local density approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method is particularly suitable for dealing with unit cells containing many atoms @xcite , which are needed to describe interfaces , since it utilizes a minimal atomic - like basis set . for the present system </S>",
    "<S> this basis set consists of si @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 as well as pb @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 states , and is complemented by orbitals of additional augmentation spheres . </S>",
    "<S> brillouin zone integrations are performed using the linear tetrahedron method , where we checked the convergence of the calculation with respect the fineness of the k - mesh by means of a growing number of up to 231 k - points in the irreducible wedge of the supercell brillouin zone .    </S>",
    "<S> our si(111)/pb(111 ) supercells comprise a si slab of about 25   thickness , an attached pb slab ranging from 1 to 18 pb mls , and a vacuum slab on top . for generating the supercells we have started from the hexagonal representation of the fcc lattice , with the ( 111 ) direction along the hexagonal @xmath13 axis . </S>",
    "<S> for the pb slab we use the experimental lattice constant @xmath14  . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for attaching the si slab ( @xmath15  ) to the pb slab we have to artificially shrink the former and introduce a lattice strain . </S>",
    "<S> although this lattice strain in the si slab is substantial , no drawback on the pb electronic structure is to be expected since there are no si states in the vicinity of the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> our supercells extend 121.25   along @xmath13 and have as basal plane a parallelogram with a 60@xmath16 interior angle and edges of length @xmath17 </S>",

    "<S> the values are normalized by the numbers of pb atoms in the supercells . </S>",
    "<S> bottom : zoom for the 11 - 18 mls range.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=39.0% ]        we obtain for the dos at the fermi energy the results displayed in fig .  [ fig : dos ] as a funtion of the pb film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly identifies the previously discussed oscillatory behavior , with a period of 2 mls , up to a thickness of 9 mls . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from this regular scheme are found in the intervals 9 - 12 and 14 - 16 mls where the oszillations are suppressed @xcite . comparing fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dos ] to the experimental data @xcite indicates that our curve is shifted by 1 ml to the left hand side , see particularly the position of the 14 - 16 mls anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> this difference might either trace back to the experimental difficulty in counting the mls or to the effects of the ( planar ) mnpc molecule on the local dos , which is not included in our treatment . since there is no ambiguity in the choice of the matching conditions at the si  </S>",
    "<S> pb interface , our approach elsewise should not lead to a 1 ml shift .    using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tk ] we next calculate from our dos data the dependence of the kondo temperature on the film thickness . to that aim , </S>",
    "<S> we use the second highest ( 150 k at 12 mls ) and smallest ( 23 k at 15 mls ) of the experimentally observed @xmath1 values to fit the free parameters @xmath6 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the correctness of the highest measured temperature ( 419 k at 15 mls ) is quite dubious , see the discussion of the authors themselves , and thus not taken into consideration . at the fermi energy , </S>",
    "<S> the ab - initio dos amounts to 0.318 ev@xmath18 for 12 mls and to 0.267 ev@xmath18 for 15 mls . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tk ] for the exchange coupling constant @xmath19 as compared to semiconductor bulk systems @xcite , the value of @xmath0 is 24 times smaller , which is not surprising because the coupling to a surface in general is much weaker than the coupling within the bulk .    due to the logarithmic dependence on @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the determined value of @xmath0 is particularly insensitive to experimental inaccuracies . the outcome of our fitting procedure is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tk ] . </S>",
    "<S> as to be expected , the dependence of @xmath1 on the film thickness largely resembles the behaviour of @xmath20 , see the bottom of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dos ] . we do not find indications of a dependence of the exchange coupling constant @xmath0 on the film thickness between 11 and 18 mls . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there is a qualitative agreement with the experimental results , even though clarification of the 1 ml shift and @xmath1 spike at 17 mls should be tackled by future experiments .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed first - principles calculations to establish the density of states of pb(111 ) films grown on a si(111 ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> these ab - initio data have enabled us to fit experimental results from measurements addressing the dependence of the kondo temperature on the pb film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have succeeded in calculating the exchange coupling constant @xmath0 , which is not accessible to direct experimental determination . for the system under investigation </S>",
    "<S> , a value of about @xmath21 ev transpires . </S>"
