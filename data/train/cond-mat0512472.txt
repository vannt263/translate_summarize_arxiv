    "feshbach resonances are presently an indispensable tool to control the atomic interactions in cold atomic physics . by simply changing the magnetic field",
    "the interactions can be tuned from weak to strong , and from effectively attractive to repulsive .",
    "we consider a two - component fermi gas in the dilute limit , i.e. the density @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 , where @xmath8  @xcite is the range of the potential , with @xmath9 the atomic mass and @xmath10 the van der waals coefficient .",
    "the fermi wavenumber @xmath2 is related to the density of a single spin component as @xmath11 .",
    "feshbach resonances originate from the coupling of scattering atoms in an energetically open channel , to one ( or several ) bound state(s ) in energetically closed channels .",
    "when the energy of a closed - channel bound state is close to the energy of the scattering atoms , the scattering process becomes resonant .",
    "the effect of two - body interactions on the atomic wave functions can be summarized by the energy - dependent scattering phase shift @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the relative collision energy .",
    "the scattering matrix is related to the phase shift by @xmath15 , and for the cold alkali gases under consideration its most general form is given by @xcite @xmath16 the direct part of the scattering matrix @xmath17 describes the interactions in the open channel , and @xmath18 is the complex energy shift , which describes the dressing of the closed - channel bound state with bare detuning @xmath19 due to the coupling with the open - channel atoms .    in scattering systems with a background scattering length @xmath20 ,",
    "the direct interactions are non - resonant , and the energy shift takes the simple form @xmath21 .",
    "the bare detuning is dressed by the constant term @xmath22 such that the dressed detuning is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the scattering length diverges for @xmath24 .",
    "the term @xmath25 describes the finite lifetime of the bound state coupled to the continuum , where the coupling strength @xmath26 is a constant related to the magnetic field width of the resonance ( see below ) .",
    "in scattering systems with a background scattering length @xmath27 , the open channel in general has a bound or virtual ( nearly - bound ) state close to the zero - energy collision threshold . in this case",
    ", the resonant energy dependence of the open - channel propagator gives rise to non - trivial energy dependence of the energy shift .",
    "explicitly taking into account the resonance poles of both the closed - channel bound state and the open - channel bound ( or virtual ) state , the energy shift can be written as @xmath28  @xcite . here the complex energy shift is written as its value at zero collision energy @xmath29 , which is real , and an additional term that accounts for the energy dependence of both the real part of the complex energy shift @xmath30 , as well as the imaginary part @xmath31 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath26 is related to the magnetic field width @xmath32 as @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the dressed detuning , @xmath35 is the magnetic moment difference between the open and closed channel , and @xmath36 with @xmath37 describes the additional energy dependence related to the resonant direct interactions .",
    "@xmath38 is the field where @xmath39 diverges , and @xmath40 is the field where @xmath41 .",
    "the interplay between the two resonances is thus described by the scattering phase shift : @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ phaseshift ] ) it follows that the total scattering length is related to these parameters by @xmath43 in the following , we will discuss scattering systems with a resonant direct interaction between the fermions . in this case the non - resonant interaction terms related to @xmath44 will generally have a small effect compared to the resonant terms , and will be ignored in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the system can be described equivalently by taking into account the scattering poles of the @xmath45 matrix of both the molecular and background bound ( or virtual ) states  @xcite , which can be shown to correspond to solutions of @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a generalized energy and field dependent effective range parameter .",
    "these poles determine the two - body @xmath45 matrix and scattering phase shift uniquely .",
    "in contrast to previous work  @xcite , where @xmath48 was taken to be a constant , here @xmath48 depends on _ both _ energy and magnetic field and describes the most general feshbach resonance that can be found in ultracold alkali gases .",
    "note that for magnetic fields where @xmath49 , the effective range parameter @xmath48 actually diverges and can not be neglected even in the case of a broad resonance .",
    "the usually considered expressions for feshbach resonance scattering without an open - channel resonance  @xcite can be seen as a limit of the general expression eq .",
    "( [ phaseshift ] ) for small @xmath50 .",
    "in order to describe the many - body properties of the system , we use the thermodynamic approach introduced by nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr )  @xcite . this approach is based on a simplified description of the full crossover problem and can not be expected to give quantitatively precise results .",
    "therefore , in recent years several directions have been pursued in order to formulate a more complete crossover theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the nsr description does capture the essential physics giving rise to the crossover phenomenon . especially the very simple relation between the two - body phase shifts in vacuum , and the in - medium phase shift used in nsr",

    "it can be shown from coupled - channels scattering theory that the effective interaction potential for the fermions in the open channel is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is related to the direct interactions between fermions in the open channel , and the second term describes the coupling of fermions to and from the closed - channel bound state  @xcite . to simplify the equations",
    ", it is convenient to replace the microscopic finite - range interaction potentials with contact potentials that correctly reproduce the scattering properties described by eq .",
    "( [ phaseshift ] ) in the two - body limit",

    "<S> we investigate the bcs - bec crossover for a feshbach resonance which allows for a large background scattering length . </S>",
