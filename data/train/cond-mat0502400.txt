    "for two decades theoretical and experimental investigations of the noise properties of small electrical conductors have been an important frontier of mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium noise , in particular shot noise @xcite can provide information on physical properties which are not accessible from conductance measurements .",
    "recently there has been considerable interest in characterizing transport in mesoscopic systems not only via conductance and noise but also with all higher order current correlations .",
    "this is achieved by deriving a generating functional from which the quantities of interest can be obtained simply by taking derivatives . to construct the generating functional , it is useful to imagine that electrons passing the sample in a given time are counted , and the approach is thus known as full counting statistics @xcite . while initial work was based on the scattering approach to electrical transport , subsequently a number of different methods have been developed .",
    "these include an approach based on keldysh green s functions @xcite , the non - linear sigma model@xcite , an approach based on a cascade of boltzmann - langevin equations @xcite and a formulation in terms of a stochastic path integral @xcite .",
    "these later methods are principally useful if the quasi - classical part of the transport coefficients is dominant . a first experiment",
    "@xcite has given additional impetus for this research .",
    "it has stimulated work which treats the effect of the measurement circuit on the counting statistics @xcite and led to proposals for novel detection schemes @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the full counting statistics ( fcs ) of transport problems in which quantum effects are important .",
    "for instance , in single channel mesoscopic conductors quantum interference is essential .",
    "in such a situation , transport becomes classical only due to dephasing .",
    "it is thus interesting to examine the effect of inelastic processes on the counting statistics of a single channel problem and to investigate the transition from quantum mechanical transport to fully classical transport .",
    "the central aim of our work is thus the derivation of the generating functional in the presence of inelastic scattering .",
    "we investigate an interferometer penetrated by an aharonov - bohm flux and subject to a random classical fluctuating potential . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the interferometer is of the mach - zehnder ( mzi ) type ( fig .",
    "[ mzi ] ) , an interferometer without backscattering .",
    "in such a system there are no closed orbits and thus only a finite number of possible trajectories .     is investigated . ]    despite these simplifying assumptions the derivation of the generating functional is a non - trivial problem . to investigate the effect of the fluctuating potential , a time - dependent treatment of transport is needed together with a technique of statistical averaging .",
    "in fact , in the present work we are able to give the generating functional only in the limiting case of the high voltage regime . in the general case , we present results for the first three cumulants .",
    "the model we investigate is closely related to earlier work by seelig et al . on the effect of dephasing on the conductance @xcite and four - terminal resistances in ballistic interferometers @xcite . in few channel structures dephasing",
    "might be sample specific @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations on dephasing in ballistic interferometers is provided by hansen et al.@xcite and kobayashi et al.@xcite .",
    "recently an electronic mzi has been experimentally realized by ji et al.@xcite , using edge states in the quantum hall regime .",
    "this experiment also raised interesting questions on the shot noise of the interferometer and dephasing .",
    "the effect of dephasing on shot noise in such an interferometer has been discussed by marquardt and bruder based on classical@xcite and quantum@xcite fluctuating field models .",
    "still another motivation for the work presented here derives from recent proposals to implement orbital entanglement @xcite based on electron - hole generation @xcite in two - particle intensity - interferometers @xcite . in these proposals quantum interference effects play an important role in noise and higher order correlations@xcite .",
    "the conceptually simplest system displaying electron interference is the electronic mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ mzi ] , it consists of two beam splitters connected by two interferometer arms enclosing a magnetic flux .",
    "each beam splitter is characterized by a transmission amplitude @xmath0 for an electron going straight through , and a reflection amplitude @xmath1 , with .",
    "the simplicity of the interferometer originates from the exclusion of backscattering which discards closed orbits and separates completely the processes of left and right moving particles .",
    "interference occurs , because the different vector potentials in the two arms lead to a phase difference between the paths @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this difference creates a characteristic flux - periodicity in the interference pattern , the aharonov - bohm effect .    in our work",
    ", dephasing is introduced with the help of classical fluctuating potentials , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the correlation function of these fluctuating potentials can be self - consistently determined treating electron - electron interactions in a random phase approximation@xcite .",
    "here we take this correlation function to be given .",
    "the potentials cause the particles to pick up an additional time - dependent phase , @xmath6 or @xmath3 ( here and in the following we set ) .",
    "we assume , that the traversal time @xmath7 of the particles is not affected by the potentials .",
    "the transmission amplitudes of particles entering the interferometer at time @xmath8 in lead @xmath9 and leaving it at time @xmath10 in lead @xmath11 are collected in the time - dependent scattering matrix@xcite @xmath12 . for a one - channel mzi",
    "this scattering matrix is four dimensional and has special properties : as backscattering is excluded , the scattering matrix has non - vanishing elements only in the off - diagonal @xmath13 blocks . because the motion is purely ballistic , the scattering matrix depends effectively on one single time , where @xmath14 here we assumed equal arm lengths and introduced the phase difference and the magnetic flux @xmath15 in units of the flux quantum .",
    "the remaining four elements are found from the magnetic field symmetry of the scattering matrix .    without the fluctuating potentials the system is coherent : .",
    "the transmission probability becomes and shows cosine oscillations in flux .",
    "such ab - oscillations are visible in conductance experiments .",
    "when we include dephasing by the fluctuating potentials , the scattering matrix becomes time - dependent and the quantities of interest have to be averaged over the statistically distributed potential .",
    "this average suppresses the ab - oscillations . for the case of conductance and noise",
    ", these effects have been studied in detail@xcite . in this work",
    "we will generalize this discussion to higher order current correlations ( full counting statistics ) .",
    "the full counting statistics@xcite ( fcs ) is the distribution function @xmath16 giving the probability that a certain charge flows through a system during the observation time @xmath17 .",
    "its fourier transform is called its generating function @xmath18 , the conjugated variable @xmath19 is named the counting field : @xmath20 the expansion of @xmath21 in @xmath19 yields all irreducible cumulants : . for large @xmath17",
    "the first cumulant gives the mean current @xmath22 , the second cumulant is the zero frequency noise , the third cumulant describes the asymmetry ( skewness ) of the distribution , and so on .",
    "the generating function provides in principle a complete description of the zero - frequency current fluctuations .",
    "we consider a four - terminal conductor , thus @xmath23 and @xmath19 are four dimensional vectors .",
    "since in the mzi current conservation relates current fluctuation of all leads , it is in most cases sufficient to concentrate on the charge distribution in one lead . in the following",
    "we will chose lead @xmath24 and call @xmath23 its charge and @xmath19 the corresponding counting variable .    in the coherent regime ( @xmath25 ) , the scattering matrix is time independent , and the calculation of the generating function is straightforward . following the work of levitov and lesovik@xcite , one defines an energy - dependent @xmath26 matrix , where the diagonal matrix contains the fermi functions of the four terminals .",
    "@xmath27 incorporates the counting fields by phase shifts ( remember that ) .",
    "the generating function is @xmath28 because backscattering is excluded , the matrix @xmath2 is block diagonal , and @xmath29 separates into two independent contributions .",
    "this fact expresses the statistical independence of left and right going particles .",
    "for a two - terminal conductor , the fcs can always be interpreted as a classical binomial distribution . for a four terminal conductor like the mzi this is in general no longer the case .",
    "there exists however a special configuration : at zero temperature a voltage @xmath30 is applied on terminal @xmath31 and zero voltage on the other terminals . in this case",
    "only two processes exist : transmission from terminal @xmath31 into lead @xmath24 with probability @xmath32 or into lead @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 .",
    "the number of incident particles during the time @xmath17 is given by .",
    "we then recover the binomial distribution of the two - terminal conductor @xmath35 with the only difference , that the transmission probability depends on the magnetic flux .",

    "thus the conductance does not suffer from energy averaging and exhibits full aharonov - bohm oscillations even at high temperatures .",

    "following the idea of ivanov and levitov@xcite , the different energies can be viewed as an infinite number of independent scattering channels .",
    "switching to time - representation , this leads to a generalization of formula  ( [ chi ] ) for the generating function , where we extend the usual trace ( @xmath41 ) to a trace in time - space ( @xmath42 ) including time integration : @xmath43 all matrices are defined in analogy to section  [ sec : fcs ] : the matrix @xmath2 depends on two time - variables ; the diagonal matrix @xmath44 contains the fourier transforms of the fermi functions in the four terminals .",

    "( [ tail ] ) the dominating contribution of the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath16 is classical , and the last two terms represent the coherent part . for positive , the large @xmath23 tail , , of the distribution function is obtained in an analogous procedure .",
    "we analyze the full counting statistics of a mesoscopic , electrical mach - zehnder interferometer penetrated by an aharonov - bohm flux , and in the presence of a classical fluctuating potential .",
    "the mach - zehnder interferometer has the advantage that there are no closed orbits .",
    "interference is only a consequence of superposition of amplitudes in the out - going channels .",
    "of interest is the generating function of transfered charge for such a quantum coherent conductor and the transition from coherent transport to classical transport .",
    "first , we discuss the probability distribution for a fully coherent mach - zehnder interferometer . at zero temperature",
    "the distribution of transfered charge is binomial like in a two terminal conductor , but with a flux - dependent transmission probability . at finite temperature",
    ", the fact that we deal with a multi - terminal conductor leads to a different distribution which becomes classical due to flux - independent two - particle processes .    in the presence of a fluctuating potential , assuming that it is gaussian , we obtain the first three cumulants as a function of the aharonov - bohm flux and a dephasing parameter .",
    "the classical fluctuating potential modulates the conductance . as a consequence",
    "the noise contains a term proportional to voltage squared . the same effect results in a term cubic in voltage in the third cumulant .",
    "in the third cumulant the conductance modulation is correlated as well with the shot noise .",
    "the cumulant of the @xmath58-th order shows oscillations in the flux up to @xmath118 .",
    "as one expects the high - order harmonics of the aharonov - bohm oscillations are suppressed much stronger with increasing dephasing than the low order oscillations .    for the limiting case of high voltage",
    "we find the generating function .",
    "this permits , like in the coherent case , the calculation of the distribution function of the transfered charge .",
    "therefore , in this limiting case , we are able to follow the suppression of the ab - oscillations in the distribution function .    for the tails of the distribution function we find that they consist of two parts : a purely classical part , independent of dephasing , which determines the dependence on transfered charge and a quantum part which governs the flux dependence .",
    "the analysis of the conceptually simple case of a mach - zehnder interferometer will hopefully provide a useful point of reference for future theoretical investigations of counting statistics in the presence of quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , the mach - zehnder interferometer is not only of theoretical interest , but recently has been realized experimentally@xcite .",
