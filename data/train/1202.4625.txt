    "the backward stochastic differential equation ( bsde , for short ) we shall consider in this paper takes the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a standard brownian motion , @xmath3 is the given terminal value and @xmath4 is the given ( random ) generator . to solve",
    "this equation is to find a pair of adapted processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfying the above equation ( [ bsde ] ) .",
    "linear backward stochastic differential equations were first studied by bismut @xcite in an attempt to solve some optimal stochastic control problem through the method of maximum principle .",
    "the general nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations were first studied by pardoux and peng @xcite . since",
    "then there have been extensive studies of this equation .",
    "we refer to the review paper by el karoui , peng and quenez @xcite , to the books of el karoui and mazliak @xcite and of ma and yong @xcite and the references therein for more comprehensive presentation of the theory .",
    "a current important topic in the applications of bsdes is the numerical approximation schemes . in most work on numerical simulations , a certain forward stochastic differential equation of the following form :",
    "@xmath7 is needed .",
    "usually it is assumed that the generator @xmath4 in ( [ bsde ] ) depends on  @xmath8 at the time @xmath9 : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a deterministic function of @xmath12 , and @xmath4 is global lipschitz in @xmath13 .",
    "if in addition the terminal value @xmath3 is of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a  deterministic function , a  so - called four - step numerical scheme has been developed by ma , protter and yong in @xcite .",
    "a basic ingredient in this paper is that the solution @xmath16 to the bsde is of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is determined by a quasi - linear partial differential equation of parabolic type .",
    "recently , bouchard and touzi @xcite propose a monte - carlo approach which may be more suitable for high - dimensional problems . again in this forward  backward setting , if the generator @xmath4 has a quadratic growth in @xmath19 , a numerical approximation is developed by imkeller and dos reis @xcite in which a truncation procedure is applied .    in the case where the terminal value @xmath3 is a functional of the path of the forward diffusion @xmath20 , namely , @xmath21 , different approaches to construct numerical methods have been proposed .",
    "we refer to bally @xcite for a scheme with a random time partition . in the work by zhang @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath22-regularity of @xmath19 is obtained , which allows one to use deterministic time partitions as well as to obtain the rate estimate ( see bender and denk @xcite , gobet , lemor and warin @xcite and zhang @xcite for different algorithms ) .",
    "we should also mention the works by briand , delyon and mmin @xcite and ma et al .",
    "@xcite , where the brownian motion is replaced by a scaled random walk .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct numerical schemes for the general bsde ( [ bsde ] ) , without assuming any particular form for the terminal value @xmath3 and generator @xmath4 .",
    "this means that @xmath3 can be an arbitrary random variable , and @xmath23 can be an arbitrary @xmath24-measurable random variable ( see assumption [ a.3.2 ] in section  [ sec2 ] for precise conditions on @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the natural tool that we shall use is the malliavin calculus .",
    "we emphasize that the main difficulty in constructing a numerical scheme for bsdes is usually the approximation of the process @xmath19 .",
    "it is necessary to obtain some regularity properties for the trajectories of this process  @xmath19 .",
    "the malliavin calculus turns out to be a suitable tool to handle these problems because the random variable @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the trace of the malliavin derivative of @xmath26 , namely , @xmath27 .",
    "this relationship was proved in the paper by el karoui , peng and quenez @xcite and was used by these authors to obtain estimates for the moments of @xmath25 .",
    "we shall further exploit this identity to obtain the @xmath0-hlder continuity of the process @xmath19 , which is the critical ingredient for the rate estimate of our numerical schemes .",
    "our first numerical scheme was inspired by the paper of zhang @xcite , where the author considers a class of bsdes whose terminal value @xmath3 takes the form  @xmath28 , where @xmath20 is a forward diffusion of the form ( [ e.1.2 ] ) , and @xmath29 satisfies a  lipschitz condition with respect to the @xmath30 or @xmath31 norms ( similar assumptions for @xmath4 ) .",
    "the discretization scheme is based on the regularity of the process @xmath19 in the mean square sense ; that is , for any partition @xmath32 , one obtains @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a constant independent of the partition @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the case of a general terminal value @xmath3 which is twice differentiable in the sense of malliavin calculus , and the first and second derivatives satisfy some integrability conditions ; we also made similar assumptions for the generator @xmath4 ( see assumption [ a.3.2 ] in section [ sec2 ] for details ) . in this sense",
    "our framework extends that of @xcite and is also natural . in this framework",
    ", we are able to obtain an estimate of the form @xmath36 where @xmath34 is a constant independent of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . clearly , ( [ e.1.4 ] ) with @xmath39 implies ( [ e.1.3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , ( [ e.1.4 ] ) implies the existence of a @xmath40-hlder continuous version of the process @xmath19 for any @xmath41 .",
    "notice that , up to now the path regularity of @xmath19 has been studied only when the terminal value and the generator are functional of a forward diffusion .    after establishing the regularity of @xmath19",
    ", we consider different types of numerical schemes .",
    "first we analyze a scheme similar to the one proposed in  @xcite [ see ( [ e.4.2 ] ) ] . in this case",
    "we obtain a rate of convergence of the following type : @xmath42 notice that this result is stronger than that in @xcite which can be stated as ( when @xmath43 ) @xmath44    we also propose and study an `` implicit '' numerical scheme [ see ( [ e.5.1 ] ) in section  [ sec4 ] for the details ] . for this scheme we obtain a much better result on the rate of convergence , @xmath45 depends on the assumptions imposed on the terminal value and the coefficients .    in both schemes ,",
    "the integral of the process @xmath19 is used in each iteration , and for this reason they are not completely discrete schemes . in order to implement the scheme on computers",
    ", one must replace an integral of the form @xmath46 by discrete sums , and then the convergence of the obtained scheme is hardly guaranteed . to avoid this discretization",
    "we propose a truly discrete numerical scheme using our representation of @xmath25 as the trace of the malliavin derivative of @xmath26 ( see section  [ sec5 ] for details ) . for this new scheme",
    ", we obtain a rate of convergence result of the form @xmath47 for any @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , we have a slightly better rate of convergence ( see theorem  [ t.6.1 ] ) , @xmath49 however , this type of result on the rate of convergence applies only to some classes of bsdes , and thus this scheme remains to be further investigated .    in the computer realization of our schemes or any other schemes ,",
    "an extremely important procedure is to compute the conditional expectation of form @xmath50 . in this paper",
    "we shall not discuss this issue but only mention the papers @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we obtain a representation of the martingale integrand @xmath19 in terms of the trace of the malliavin derivative of @xmath51 , and then we get the @xmath0-hlder continuity of @xmath19 by using this representation . the conditions that we assume on the terminal value  @xmath3 and the generator @xmath4",
    "are also specified in this section .",
    "some examples of application are presented to explain the validity of the conditions .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to the analysis of the approximation scheme similar to the one introduced in @xcite . under some differentiability and integrability conditions in the sense of malliavin calculus on @xmath3 and the nonlinear coefficient @xmath4",
    ", we establish a better rate of convergence for this scheme . in section  [ sec4 ] , we introduce an `` implicit '' scheme and obtain the rate of convergence in the @xmath0 norm .",
    "a  completely discrete scheme is proposed and analyzed in section  [ sec5 ] .    throughout the paper for simplicity",
