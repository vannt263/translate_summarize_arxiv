    "topological insulator ( ti ) is a new class of materials .",
    "the surface state ( ss ) of tis has a band structure of dirac - cone shape where the spin of carriers is locked with their momentum except for @xmath2=0@xcite .",
    "the ss of tis is metallic protected by time - reversal symmetry and exceedingly high mobility is expected in the transport of mass - less dirac fermions in the ss .",
    "the topological ss has so far been investigated intensively , for example , in bi@xmath3sb@xmath4@xcite , bi@xmath5se@xmath6@xcite , bi@xmath5te@xmath6@xcite , and tlbise@xmath5@xcite through electrical transport measurements and the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "recent explorations of tis have opened the door of a new type of tis , that is , topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) , in which the topological ss is protected by the mirror symmetry ( reflection symmetry ) of the crystal@xcite@xcite , instead of the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "snte was predicted to be one of the tcis whose ss is protected by mirror symmetry with respect to the \\{111 } , \\{001 } , and \\{110 } planes of the rock - salt crystal structure .",
    "the apres measurement confirmed the topological phase in the ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces of snte by observing dirac - cone band dispersion derived from the ss@xcite@xcite as well as pb@xmath3sn@xmath4te(@xmath7",
    "@xmath8 0.25)@xcite and in the ( 001 ) surface of pb@xmath9sn@xmath10se@xcite .",
    "in addition , the electrical transport properties which are characteristics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) ss have been reported , such as the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillation@xcite , and the altshuler - aronov - spivak ( aas)/ the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect@xcite .    in the present study , we investigated the magneto - transport properties in a snte(111 ) thin film , which was grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "in the transverse magnetoresistance ( mr ) , we observed a positive mr , which is attributed to the weak antilocalization ( wal ) in the transport through the ss .",
    "the wal in the ss of tis is considered to arise from a different mechanism from the case of the conventional transport ; the prohibition of backscattering due to the accumulated @xmath0 berry phase of dirac fermions is essential for the wal instead of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi)@xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the wal in tis or tcis is useful for gaining an insight into the transport properties of the 2d ss@xcite@xcite . in the case of snte",
    ", the ss has not been confirmed sufficiently from the viewpoint of the electrical transport because of the recent recognition as a tci . in this article , we report the observation of a positive mr originating from the wal in the ss in a ( 111 ) thin film of single - crystal snte .",
    "this result suggests that the surface transport of 2d ss of snte can be detected even in the existence of a large contribution to the electrical transport of high - density bulk carriers due to sn vacancies .",
    "thin films of the ( 111 ) plane of single - crystal snte were epitaxially grown on baf@xmath5(111 ) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) equipped with elementary sources of sn and te .",
    "the substrate temperature was kept at 220@xmath11c during the growth of snte .",
    "the molecular beam flux ratio of sn / te was 1/20 ( te - rich condition ) .",
    "the thickness of the grown snte film was 115 nm .",

    "the surface of the snte film is smooth in the range of the atomic scale although the macroscopic morphology shows a characteristic structure .",
    "the surface morphology was found to be quite sensitive to the molecular beam flux ratio sn / te and the substrate temperature during growth .",

    "could be interpreted as a result of the weak localization ( wl ) in the transport through the bulk subbands ; due to a small thickness of the film in the present measurement , the bulk state inside the film is quantized into 2d subbands and the wl can be expected in the transport through these quantized subbands@xcite",

    "in addition , considering the surface transport through both the top and bottom surfaces of the film , the total number of the channel should be 8 , resulting in the value of @xmath42 = 4 .",
    "however , @xmath42 around 2 was obtained from the measurement at 2k , giving the number of channels in the ss around 4 . a possible explanation for this deviation in the value of @xmath33 would be given by the coupling between the ss and the bulk state or the coupling between the different sss , as recently suggested for a small value of @xmath42 @xcite @xcite ;",
    "if there is a coupling between different transport channels due to the scattering of carriers from one transport channel to another with keeping the phase coherence , they contribute to the conductance as a single phase - coherent channel .",
    "we investigated the mr in the snte(111 ) thin film at low temperatures in order to clarify the properties of the ss of tcis from the viewpoint of electrical transport .",
    "we observed that positive and negative components coexist in the mr curve near zero field at lowest temperatures of 2 - 3 k while only the positive mr appears at elevated temperatures of 6 - 10 k. the positive mr is attributed to the wal originating from the surface transport in the ss , while the negative mr to the weak localization ( wl ) effect originating from the transport in the quantized 2d subbands of the bulk state .",
    "we deduced the prefactor @xmath33 and the phase coherence length @xmath31 by fitting the observed mc due to the wal with the hln equation .",
    "the value of @xmath42 was much smaller than expected from the nominal total number of the transport channels of the ss in the snte ( 111 ) surface , which suggests the coupling between the ss and bulk state .",
