    "nonlinear excitations ( solitons , kink - solitons , intrinsically localized modes and breathers ) can be created most easily in low - dimensional ( 1d and quasi-1d ) systems @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the existence of intrinsically localized modes and breathers in various systems such as 2d and 3d arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite , low - dimensional crystals @xcite , antiferromagnetic materials @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , photonic structures and micromechanical systems @xcite , protein @xmath2-helices @xcite , and @xmath2-uranium @xcite .",
    "slowly - moving breathers and supersonic kink - solitons were also described in 1d nonlinear chains @xcite , dna macromolecules @xcite and quasi-1d polymer crystals @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional arrays of magnetic or optical microtraps for bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of ultracold quantum gases with tunneling coupling provide a new field for the studies of coherent nonlinear dynamics in low - dimensional systems @xcite . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the tunneling coupling between two becs is similar to the linear coupling between two optical waveguides @xcite or between two oscillator chains ( nonlinear phononic waveguides ) .",
    "here we show that @xmath3-@xmath4 dynamics of macroscopic ensembles of classical particles ( weakly - localized breathers ) in two weakly linked nonlinear oscillator chains has a profound analogy , and is described by a similar in every respect pair of equations , to the tunneling quantum dynamics of two weakly linked becs in a macroscopic double - well potential ( single bosonic josephson junction ) @xcite .",
    "the exchange of energy and excitations between the coupled classical oscillator chains takes on the role which the exchange of atoms via quantum tunneling plays in the case of coupled becs . therefore such phase - coherent energy and excitation exchange can be considered as a classical counterpart of macroscopic tunneling quantum dynamics .",
    "we show that there are two qualitatively different dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers , the oscillatory exchange of the low - amplitude breather between the chains ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) , and one - chain - localization ( nonlinear self - trapping ) of the high - amplitude breather .",
    "these two regimes , which are detached by a separatrix mode with zero rate of energy and excitation exchange , are analogous to the two regimes in nonlinear dynamics of macroscopic condensates in a single bosonic josephson junction @xcite .",
    "essentially , the phase - coherent dynamics of the coupled classical breathers is described by a pair of equations , which coincides with the pair of coupled mean - field equations describing coherent atomic tunneling in a single bosonic tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "the predicted evolution of the relative phase of two weakly coupled coherent breathers in both dynamical regimes is also analogous to the evolution of relative quantum mechanical phase between two weakly coupled macroscopic condensates , which was directly measured in a single bosonic josephson junction by means of interference @xcite .",
    "moreover , the predicted separatrix in the excitation exchange between macroscopic ensembles of phase - coherent particles ( weakly localized breathers ) in coupled oscillator chains with `` repulsive '' nonlinearity , which is determined by the ratio of the intra - chain nonlinearity ( intra - chain interaction ) and the inter - chain coupling , can be considered as a classical nonlinear dynamical model of the reversible interaction - induced superfluid - mott - insulator quantum phase transition , observed in bec with repulsive inter - atomic interaction in a lattice with tunneling inter - site coupling @xcite .",
    "all these results bring to light a striking similarity , both in display and evolution equations , between the classical phase - coherent excitation exchange and macroscopic tunneling quantum dynamics which can motivate new predictions and experiments in both fields . on the basis of this profound analogy",
    ", we predict a new tunneling regime of two weakly coupled becs in which their relative phase oscillates around @xmath0 modulo @xmath1 , which can be observed by means of interference .",
    "this regime is different from the regime of josephson plasma oscillations , already realized in experiments @xcite , when the relative phase of two weakly linked becs oscillates ( or fluctuates @xcite ) around zero .",
    "we also show that static displacements of the coupled chains with nonlinear localized excitation , induced by cubic term in the intra - chain anharmonic potential , scale approximately as the total vibration energy of the excitation , either one- or two - chain one , and do not depend on the inter - chain coupling .",
    "this observation is also valid for a narrow stripe of several parallel coupled nonlinear chains .",
    "we also study two - chain breathers which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with different symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains , and bifurcation of the anti - phase two - chain breather into the one - chain one .",
    "bound states of two breathers with different commensurate frequencies are also found in the two - chain system .",
    "merging of two breathers with different frequencies in one breather in two coupled chains is described . periodic transverse translation ( wandering ) of low - amplitude breather in a system of several , up to five , coupled nonlinear chains is observed , and the dependence of the wandering period on the number of chains is analytically estimated and compared with numerical results .",
    "delocalizing transition of 1d breather in 2d system of a large number of parallel coupled nonlinear chains is described , in which the breather , initially excited in a given 1d chain , abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2d system upon decreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one .",
    "the threshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2d system , the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the inter - chain coupling constant , and breather vibration energy is localized mainly in one chain at the delocalization threshold .",
    "similar delocalizing transition for 1d breather should occur also in 3d array of parallel coupled nonlinear chains .",
    "delocalizing transition of discrete breather in 2d and 3d systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with delocalizing transition for polarons in 2d and 3d lattices @xcite and for bose - einstein condensates in 2d and 3d optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "ii we describe our model and the analytical predictions , derived on the basis of this model . in section iii",
    "we describe our numerical simulations and comparison with the analytical predictions , which include simulation of dynamics of discrete breathers in two weakly coupled chains ( section iii a ) , simulation of wandering breather in two weakly coupled chains ( section iii b ) , and simulation of breathers in a system of @xmath7 parallel weakly coupled anharmonic chains ( section iii c ) . in section",

    "<S> we show that there are two qualitatively different dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers , either immovable or slowly - moving : the periodic transverse translation ( wandering ) of low - amplitude breather between the chains , and the one - chain - localization of high - amplitude breather . </S>",
    "<S> these two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations , which involve large number of anharmonic oscillators , can be mapped onto two solutions of a single pendulum equation , detached by a separatrix mode . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that these two regimes of coupled phase - coherent breathers are similar , and are described by a similar pair of equations , to the two regimes in nonlinear tunneling dynamics of two weakly linked bose - einstein condensates . on the basis of this profound analogy , </S>",
    "<S> we predict a new tunneling mode of two weakly coupled bose - einstein condensates in which their relative phase oscillates around @xmath0 modulo @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also study two - chain breathers , which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with different symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains , and bifurcation of the anti - phase two - chain breather into the one - chain one . </S>",
    "<S> we show that static displacements of the coupled chains with nonlinear localized excitation , induced by cubic term in the intra - chain anharmonic potential , scale approximately as the total vibration energy of the excitation , either one- or two - chain one , and do not depend on the inter - chain coupling . </S>",
    "<S> delocalizing transition of 1d breather in 2d system of a large number of parallel coupled nonlinear chains is described , in which the breather , initially excited in a given chain , abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2d system upon decreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2d system , and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the inter - chain coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational breather in 2d and 3d systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with delocalizing transition for bose - einstein condensates in 2d and 3d optical lattices . </S>"
