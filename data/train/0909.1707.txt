    "a recent analysis @xcite of heavy hypernuclei confirms the systematic smallness of the @xmath1-nuclear spin - orbit splitting .",
    "many theoretical attempts were made over the years to understand the weakness of the @xmath1-nuclear spin - orbit coupling @xcite , with model assumptions ranging from quark degrees of freedom via phenomenological boson exchange mechanisms to unusually strong ( negative ) @xmath6 tensor couplings .",
    "the systematics of @xmath1-nuclear shell model orbitals have been studied in a variety of approaches .",
    "the quark - meson coupling model @xcite seeks the origin of the weak spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath1 at the quark level .",
    "relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models @xcite generate the spin - orbit coupling by the coherent interplay of scalar and vector mean fields .",
    "even though these fields are only about half as strong for @xmath1 hyperons as compared to those for nucleons in nuclei , the resulting @xmath1-nuclear spin - orbit splittings are usually still too large unless additional ad - hoc mechanisms are invoked for their suppression . in mean - field descriptions with phenomenological density dependent interactions of skyrme type @xcite , and in several hypernuclear many - body calculations ( fermi hypernetted chain , brueckner - hartree - fock ) @xcite , the spin - orbit splitting is suppressed simply by hand .    in this article",
    "we follow a different path motivated by recent developments at the interface between low - energy qcd and the nuclear many - body problem .",

    "the contact terms generate contributions to the energy per particle that are linear in the density @xmath9 .",
    "these terms need to be adjusted , e.g. by reproducing the empirical binding energy , while terms of higher ( fractional ) powers in the density , involving effects of the filled fermi sea on two - pion exchange processes , are computed with input fixed entirely by empirical low - energy pion - nucleon data .",
    "three - nucleon interactions are systematically incorporated .",
    "spin - orbit forces follow consistently from the evaluation of spin - dependent terms in inhomogeneous nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the translation of this framework into a relativistic energy density functional for finite nuclei @xcite is designed so that it keeps the separation - of - scales concepts of the previous nuclear matter calculations .",
    "it includes explicit pion and two - pion exchange dynamics up to three - loop order in the energy density .",
    "it also incorporates strong scalar and vector mean fields ( equivalent to contact interactions and constrained by in - medium qcd sum rules ) , and an additional surface ( derivative ) term .",

    "intermediate range spin - orbit forces induced by the pion exchange tensor interaction in second order , with pauli blocking of intermediate nucleon states ; 3 .   a three - body spin - orbit interaction of fujita - miyazawa type @xcite , produced by two - pion exchange with intermediate excitation of a virtual @xmath13 isobar .",
    "all of these mechanisms are generated within the in - medium chiral dynamics framework .",
    "the important feature pointed out in refs . @xcite and further elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that mechanism ( ii ) comes with opposite sign but similar magnitude as compared to mechanisms ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
