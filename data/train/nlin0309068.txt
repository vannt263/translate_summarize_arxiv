    "this will be important in the sequel .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the phenomenological approach to multifractality via fractional derivatives @xcite and adapt it to a multifractal measure .",

    "singularity exponents @xmath22 may be viewed as local hlder exponents of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath225 for @xmath226 .",

    "@xcite , as the multiplication in the fourier space by @xmath227 by @xmath228 ( see ref .",

    "a key assumption in the phenomenology is that this argument can be carried over to non - isolated multifractal singularities , provided we take all types of singularities into account . for the feigenbaum invariant measure , we know the hausdorff dimension @xmath120 of the set of points having a singularity with exponent @xmath22 . assuming that we can also use @xmath120 as a covering dimension , we can express the probability to have a singularity of exponent @xmath22 contributing a fractional derivative of order @xmath2 which exceeds ( in absolute value ) a given large value @xmath231 , that is we require @xmath232 in terms of the codimension of the set @xmath233 , the probability to satisfy ( [ e : y - x ] ) is written as @xmath234 here @xmath235 is the spatial dimension ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "taking now into account the singularities with all possible exponents @xmath22 , the tail of the cumulative probability of the fractional derivative of order @xmath2 is given , to the leading order , by the following power law @xmath237 an easy calculation shows that @xmath156 corresponding to the infimum in ( [ e : inf ] ) satisfies @xmath238 which immediately gives @xmath239 .",
    "on the other hand , we know that @xmath240 here the infimum is given by an @xmath22 satisfying the very same relation @xmath239 .",
    "hence , @xmath241 using ( [ alpha_star ] ) , we get @xmath242 where the second relation follows from @xmath239 .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of this equation is that the ( negative ) exponent of the power - law tail for the fractional derivative of order @xmath2 is the @xmath9-value of the intersection of the graph of @xmath7 and of a straight line of slope @xmath2 through the origin .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the presence of the finite range of scaling , the power - law tail ( [ e : cprob ] ) emerges only if the multifractality is sufficiently strong .",
    "this strength is given by the multifractality parameter @xmath243 , a measure of how strongly the data depart from being self similar ( which would imply @xmath244 ) : @xmath245 where @xmath246 . it was shown that observability of the power - law requires a sufficiently large value for the product @xmath247 , where @xmath56 is the number of octaves over which the data present multifractal scaling . in practice",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath248 for example , fully - developed turbulence velocity data @xcite have typical @xmath249 values of the order of @xmath250 , thereby requiring a monstrous inertial range of about 300  octaves for observability of power - law tails .",
    "as we shall see , the situation is much more favorable for the feigenbaum invariant measure .    before turning to numerical questions ,",
    "we comment on an issue raised by an anonymous referee who worried about the nonlocal character of the fractional derivative and wrote in essence that our approach makes sense , strictly speaking , only for ( statistically ) translationally invariant in space systems : otherwise , if the system consists of components whose `` fractal properties '' are rather different the results will be smeared out .",
    "our feeling about such matters is summarized as follows .",
    "first one can observe that , of course , the attractor for the feigenbaum map is not homogeneous ( translation - invariant ) but after zooming in it becomes increasingly so ; the fractional derivative is not a local operator but the tail of its pdf is likely to be dominated by strongly localized events .",
    "second , a more technical observation .",
    "the idea of the multi - fractal analysis is based on the fact that the dynamics of a system determines a variety of scales .",
    "it is important that these scales do not depend on a particular place in the phase space . on the contrary , they are present and `` interact '' with each other everywhere . in the case of the feigenbaum attractor",
    "the scales depend on a symbolic location in a system of partitions . in physical systems , like homogeneous turbulence , such partitions are difficult to define rigorously . however , the invariance with respect to the space coordinate is still present and forms a basis for applicability of the multifractal calculus .",
    "the phenomenological arguments presented in the previous section suggest that we should find power - law tails in the cumulative probability for fractional derivatives of @xmath1 for suitable orders @xmath2 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ f : feigen - zetap ] indicates that @xmath2 should be between the minimum slope of the graph and unity .",
    "the value @xmath251 is of course not a fractional order but , as we shall see , it is associated with a power - law tail of exponent minus one .. ( putting @xmath252 into the partition function @xmath253 , we have @xmath254 . ) ] the minimum slope can be easily found .",
    "indeed , @xmath80 takes large values when @xmath66 is large negative . in this case the main contribution to @xmath80comes from the shortest interval of the partition with the length of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath255 in the limit @xmath256 .",
    "this gives the following lower bound of the differentiation order : @xmath257 we have already observed that , because the @xmath7 graph does not pass through the origin , substantial values can be expected for the multifractality parameter @xmath243 .",
    "the actual values of @xmath249 , associated to values of @xmath9 ranging from @xmath258 to 3 by increments of @xmath259 are shown in table  [ t : fzetap ] , together with the number @xmath56 of scaling octaves needed determined by @xmath260 ( cf .",
