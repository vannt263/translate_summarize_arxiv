    "the late - time evolution of various fields outside a collapsing star has important implications for several aspects of black - hole physics .",
    "for example , the no - hair theorem @xcite introduced by wheeler in the early 1970 s , states that the external field of a black hole relaxes to a kerr - newman field characterized solely by the black - hole s mass , charge and angular - momentum .",
    "thus , it is of interest to explore the dynamical mechanism responsible for the relaxation of perturbations fields outside a black hole and to determine the decay rate of the various perturbations .",
    "in addition , the dynamical mechanism of generating perturbation fields ingoing to a black hole is of interest in relation to the problem of stability of the cauchy horizon @xcite .",
    "it was first demonstrated by price @xcite , regarding scalar , gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations of schwarzschild black hole exterior , that the fields die off at late time with an inverse power - law tail .",
    "it has been shown that for a spherical - harmonic wave mode of multiple number @xmath3 , a @xmath4 or @xmath5 decay tail ( @xmath6 being the schwarzschild time coordinate ) dominates at late time , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "the same tail behavior occurs also for reissner - nordstrm black holes and fields of different spin .",
    "recently the linear perturbation analyses and the nonlinear simulations have been done by gundlach et al . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) in addition , the recent treatment of tails in the spacetime of a spinning black hole has been done by barack and ori @xcite .",
    "many previous works are mainly concerned with massless fields .",
    "however , the evolution of massive scalar fields will become important , for example , if one considers kaluza - klein theories , in which the fourier modes can behave like massive fields .",
    "further , the recent development of the kaluza - klein idea , such as rendall - sundrum model @xcite in string theory , strongly motivates us to understand the evolutional features characteristic to the field mass in detail",
    ".    the physical mechanism by which late - time tails of massive scalar fields are generated may be qualitatively different from that of massless ones .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out that the oscillatory inverse power - law tails @xmath7 dominates as the intermediate late - time , if the field mass @xmath2 is small @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hp ] ) that massive fields decay slower than massless ones , and waves with peculiar frequency @xmath8 quite close to @xmath2 can contribute to massive tail , while low frequency waves can contribute to massless tail .",
    "though the oscillatory power - law form ( [ eq : hp ] ) has been numerically verified at intermediate late times , @xmath9 , it should be noted that the intermediate tails are not the final asymptotic behaviors ; another wave pattern can dominate at very late times , when it still remains very difficult to determine numerically the exact decay rate @xcite .    in the previous paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i , we have analytically found that the transition from the intermediate behavior to the asymptotic one occurs in nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "the oscillatory inverse power - law behavior of the dominant asymptotic tail is approximately given by @xmath10 independently of angular momentum wave number @xmath3 , and the decay becomes slower than the intermediate ones .",
    "the origin of such an asymptotic tail is expected to be a resonance backscattering due to curvature - induced potential",
    ". this will be supported by the relationship between the field mass and the time scale when the @xmath0 tail dominates ; for @xmath11 , the smaller @xmath12 is , the later the @xmath0 tail begins to dominate ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the black - hole mass ) .",
    "on the other hand , for large field mass @xmath15 , the larger @xmath12 is , the later the @xmath0 tail begins to dominate ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore , the time scale when the @xmath0 tail dominates will become minimum at @xmath17 , which means that the most effective backscattering occurs for such massive scalar fields with the compton wave length @xmath18 nearly equal to the horizon radius @xmath14 .    in this paper , following paper i which was devoted to the analysis for nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm background",
    ", we investigate the asymptotic tails of a massive scalar field in schwarzschild background . the purpose of this paper is to determine analytically the decay rate and to confirm that the asymptotic tail with the decay rate of @xmath0 is not peculiar to the nearly extreme black hole .",
    "nevertheless , it is sure that the form of effective potential varies according to the ratio of the black - hole charge to the mass .",
    "then , we also study the difference of the asymptotic tail behavior in schwarzschild background from that in nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm . in sec .",
    "ii , to analyze time evolution of massive scalar fields , we introduce the black - hole green s function using the spectral decomposition method @xcite .",
    "differently from the case of nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm in paper i , it is difficult to analyze the field equations for the arbitrary field mass @xmath2 . in this paper , therefore , we consider the cases of small field mass @xmath11 in sec .",
    "iii and large one @xmath15 in sec .",
    "iv , and we compare the results with those found in nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "section v is devoted to a summary .",

    "then , the late - time tail behaviors which are our main concern should be given by the integral along the branch cut placed along the interval @xmath38 .",
    "now the fourier component of the green s function @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of two linearly independent solutions for the homogeneous equation @xmath40 the boundary condition for the basic solution @xmath41 is that it describes purely ingoing waves crossing the event horizon , i.e. , @xmath42 at @xmath43 , while @xmath44 is required to damp exponentially at spatial infinity , i.e. , @xmath45 at @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . because the complex conjugate @xmath48 is also a solution for eq .",

    "we have shown that the asymptotic oscillatory tail with the decay rate of @xmath0 and with the period @xmath1 dominates , which is identical with that in nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "in addition , we have noted that the relation between the value of @xmath12 and the time - scale when the @xmath0 tail begins to dominate also holds ; the smaller the value of @xmath12 is , the later the @xmath0 tail begins to dominate ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "we can understand more clearly the tail behavior to be a backscattering effect due to space - time curvature . in the small - mass case @xmath11 , the intermediate tail with an oscillatory power - law dominates at the time scale @xmath183 before the asymptotic tail discussed here dominates @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "at both the intermediate and asymptotic time scales the frequency of a wave which contributes to tails is very close to @xmath2 .",
    "however , the oscillation of the asymptotic tail is modulated by phase shift effects which do not appear in the intermediate tail . there",
    "exist two types of the phase shift , which are monotonous and periodic with time .",
    "the periodic phase shift crucially depends on the field mass .",
    "the shift angle becomes nearly equal to @xmath184 in small mass limit @xmath185 , and the shift oscillates at the time scale of @xmath144 , which is a long - term effect if compared with the basic oscillation with the period of @xmath120 . in large mass limit",
    "@xmath186 , the shift angle become very small . in scattering theory , it is well - known that the phase shift of wave is connected with the presence of the scatterer . in this case , of course , the scatterer is the effective potential of black - hole spacetime .",
    "therefore it is clear that tails of massive scalar fields are generated from backscattering due to space - time curvature .",
    "the shift angle in schwarzschild geometry is numerically different from that in nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm geometry , but the qualitative behavior depending on @xmath12 is similar .    we can conclude that the asymptotic tail with the qualitatively same behavior dominates both in schwarzschild and in nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "therefore it is conjectured that the oscillatory @xmath0 tail caused by _ resonance _ backscattering at asymptotic late times is a general feature in _",
    "arbitrary _ reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "it remains in a future work to investigate what kind of instability of cauchy horizons is caused by the massive tails .",
    "finally we give a comment in comparison with the effects induced by the field mass @xmath2 on vacuum polarization of quantum massive scalar fields in the thermal state .",
    "it has been found that the amplitude of vacuum polarization is enhanced around @xmath187 in the case of nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm geometry , while it is not seen in schwarzschild case @xcite .",
    "the field - mass induced effect on vacuum polarization becomes clear only in the nearly extreme limit .",
    "the reason will be explained as follows ; vacuum polarization of massive scalar fields is due to both thermal excitation induced by black - hole temperature and mass induced excitation . in nearly extreme case , of which the black - hole temperature is nearly zero , the mass induced effect becomes significant because the thermal excitation is suppressed . on the other hand , in schwarzschild case the mass induced effect",
    "is just hidden because the thermal effect by the black - hole temperature can dominate .",
    "we expect that resonance behavior due to the mass of a field interacting with a black hole may exist in various processes as a generic feature of black - hole geometry . in order to confirm this conjecture ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate various processes of massive fields in more general black hole models .",
