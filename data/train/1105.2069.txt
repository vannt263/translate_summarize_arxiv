    "a standard polling model is a single - server system where the server visits a finite number of queues in cyclic order .",
    "the stability and performance analysis of polling models with cyclic and other scheduling policies has been a very popular research topic for several decades .",
    "see , e.g. borst ( 1995 ) ; boxma et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; wierman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; winands et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and the lists of references therein for the progress in the studies of polling models .",
    "one of the key tools in the modern stability analysis of queueing networks is the fluid limit approach .",
    "see , e.g. , chen and mandelbaum ( 1991 ) ; rybko and stolyar ( 1992 ) ; stolyar ( 1995 ) ; dai ( 1995 ) ; dai and meyn ( 1995 ) ; down ( 1996 ) for the detailed description .",
    "this approach involves the use of the functional strong law of large numbers and works perfectly well if one can identify all the limiting parameters / functions there .",
    "this holds , in particular , for models where the server s scheduling is state - independent .    in this paper , we make an attempt to study a model with an adaptive scheduling of the server s visits to queues .",
    "namely , we consider a model with 3 queues and a cyclic policy , but assume in addition that if in some cycle the server finds queue 2 empty , it does not visit this queue in the next cycle .",
    "this may make sense if one assumes , in addition , that the direct walking time from queue 1 to queue 3 is smaller than that via queue 2 .",
    "we consider three types of server s policies / disciplines in queues : limited , gated and exhaustive .",
    "we were motivated by the paper vishnevsky and semenova ( 2008 ) where the authors considered a general model with many queues and proposed a numerical iterative scheme to calculate the mean waiting time .",
    "they showed numerically that , in the case of limited service disciplines , the stability region may become bigger by implementing such an adaptive scheduling .",
    "our original intention was to bring a mathematical accuracy here and to obtain , for the proposed scheme , some necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability which are better than those in non - adaptive schemes .",
    "we planned to use the fluid limit approach for the stability .",
    "however , we have completed only a part of our programme .",
    "first , we derived the evolution differential equations for the fluid limits .",
    "then we got two types of results .    when the service discipline in each queue is either gated or exhaustive , the exact stability region is derived .",
    "the stability region in this case is the same as for the standard non - adaptive schemes , and the stability analysis here is a straightforward application of the techniques developed , say , in dai ( 1995 ) and dai and meyn ( 1995 ) .",
    "so , a possible advantage of the use of adaptive scheduling is not in the stability , but in the performance : when the polling systems are stable , stationary characteristics under the adaptive schemes may be smaller than those under the non - adaptive schemes .",
    "if the server discipline in each queue is limited , then we can derive tight fluid model equations only in the case where the service discipline in the second queue is 1-limited .",
    "for a general limited discipline , we use simple bounds for a fluid model equation to obtain separately sufficient conditions for stability and for instability .",
    "it is known that a sample - path analysis of fluid limits may become inefficient due to several reasons .",
    "one of them was discussed , for example , by foss and kovalevskii ( 1999 ) who considered fluid limits as weak limits of stochastic processes under the linear scaling in time and in space and show , in particular , that these limits may stay random .",
    "we will discuss another reason for the limitation of the fluid limit approach which is observed in the polling models : a stability region may depend on the entirely whole distribution of driving sequences .",
    "we believe that the gap between the stability and instability conditions is not just a technical limitation of the fluid approximation , but indicates that the conditions obtained are as sharp as one could get based only on the knowledge of the first moments .",
    "we guess that , for any set of parameters in the gap , one may propose a system that is stable and another system that is unstable .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ] , we provide a detailed description of the polling system and of the underlying markov process",
    ". then we present the main results of the paper on stability and instability of the system . in section [ section3 ]",
    ", we introduce fluid limits for the system with limited service policies , derive dynamical fluid equations and recall known stability and instability criteria via fluid limits .",
    "then we prove in section [ section4 ] the main results , in the case of limited service policies .",
    "section [ section5 ] presents simulation results and a discussion on applicability and accuracy of the fluid model approach for ( in)stability of polling systems with adaptive routing and limited service disciplines . in section [ section6 ]",
    ", we study a fluid model for gated and exhaustive service disciplines and prove the main theorems in this case .",
    "we consider a polling system with three infinite - buffer queues / stations and a single server .",
    "the input stream to queue @xmath0 is described by interarrival times @xmath1 between @xmath2th and @xmath3st customers , @xmath4 ; and @xmath2th customer in queue @xmath5 requires @xmath6 units of time for service .",
    "the server visits queues in a cyclic order .",
    "we assume that the cycles start from queue 1 , and that there are two possible cycle types :    * _ standard _ cycle : @xmath7 ; * _ reduced _ cycle : @xmath8 .",
    "a choice of the type of the next cycle on the base of the current cycle information is decribed in detail later on . in short ,",
    "the server may decide not to visit queue 2 in the next cycle if it finds that queue empty .",
    "the @xmath2th walking ( switch - over ) time from station @xmath5 to station @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 , while walking times from station 1 to station 3 are @xmath11 .",
    "a service discipline describes the number of customers that ( may be ) served during a single visit of the server to a queue .",
    "we will assume that the service disciplines in all queues are the same and belong to one of the following three classes :    1 .",
    "_ limited _ : upon a visit to queue @xmath0 , the server serves at most @xmath12 customers , i.e. it continues working until either a predefined number @xmath13 of customers is served or until the queue becomes empty , whichever occurs first ; 2 .",
    "_ gated _ : upon a visit to a queue , the server serves all the customer that are present at the moment of the arrival , and only those customers ; 3 .",
    "_ exhaustive _ : the server continues to serve customers in a queue until the queue becomes empty .",
    "now we describe inductively the way how does the server choose a type of the next cycle . here",
    "the state of queue 2 ( empty or not ) within a cycle plays a crucial role .    *",
    "the first cycle is of the standard type . *",
    "if cycle @xmath2 is of the standard type , and * * if , within this cycle , the server finds queue @xmath14 non - empty and proceeds with the service there , then cycle @xmath15 is again standard ; * * if queue 2 is empty , the cycle @xmath15 is reduced . * if cycle @xmath2 is reduced , then cycle @xmath15 is standard .    * stochastic assumptions : * we assume that all sequences of random variables introduced above are mutually independent and that each of these sequences is i.i.d .",
    ", with a finite first moment .",
    "we introduce arrival and service rates at each queue as @xmath16 let @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "further , we introduce switch - over rates as @xmath19 then @xmath20 is the mean switch - over time in the standard cycle , and @xmath21 is the mean switch - over time in the reduced cycle .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 which makes sense : the server may decide to skip its visit to queue 2 if this may decrease the cycle time .    * representing markov process : * we use @xmath23 to denote the state of our polling system at time @xmath24 .",
    "the components are described below :    * @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of customers that are either waiting in queue @xmath27 or being served at station @xmath27 at time @xmath24 .",
    "* @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the remaining interarrival time of the arrival process to queue @xmath27 at time @xmath24 .",
    "* @xmath30 is the remaining service time of a customer who is being served at time @xmath24 if the server is in service ( and @xmath31 if the server is walking at time @xmath24 ) .",
    "* @xmath32 is the remaining walking time of the server at time @xmath24 , if the server is walking ( and @xmath33 if the server is in service ) . * if the server is in service at time @xmath24 , @xmath34 is the station the server works at . if the server is walking at time @xmath24 , @xmath34 is the station the server is walking to .",
    "* @xmath35 takes values 0 and 1 .",
    "it switches from 0 to 1 at the moment when the server arrives at queue 2 and finds it empty , and , vise versa , from 1 to 0 when the server starts its walking from queue 1 to queue 3 in a reduced cycle .",
    "* @xmath36 is an additional parameter at time @xmath24 that makes @xmath37 a markov process . if the server is in service at time @xmath24 , then @xmath36 is the number of service completions at queue @xmath34 by time @xmath24 during the current visit to the queue , for limited service disciplines ; and the number of arrivals at queue @xmath34 by time @xmath24 during the current visit to the queue , for gated service disciplines . in both cases we let",
    "@xmath38 when the server is walking . in the case of exhaustive disciplines , we do not need an extra parameter , so let @xmath39 .",
    "the processes @xmath40 are taken to be right - continuous with left limits .",
    "it follows from dai ( 1995 ) that @xmath41 is a strong markov process whose state space @xmath42 is a subset of @xmath43 .    the markov process @xmath41 is said to be positive harris recurrent if it possesses a unique stationary distribution .",
    "to state the main results of this paper , we make the following assumptions on the interarrival time distributions .",
    "for each @xmath0 , we assume that the distribution of random variable @xmath44 has an unbounded support , i.e. , @xmath45 , for all @xmath46 .",

    "specifically we observe fluid limits with @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",

    "these examples illustrate that the stability conditions in the system under consideration are not determined , in general , by the first moments of the distributions of the primitive sequences .",
    "we go further and show by example that the knowledge of the first two moments is also not enough .",
    "we present example 4 where the distribution of inter - arrival times to queue 2 have the same 1st and 2nd moments with exponential distribution from example 3 , but here also the fractions of interest significantly differ .    finally , we finish with showing that even the knowledge of the first three moments is insufficient . in example 5 , the distribution of inter - arrival times to queue 2 have the same the first , the second and the third moments with exponential distribution from example 3 , but again with different fractions of interest .",
