    "there has been much discussion about how to define and measure interaction .",
    "the interaction of two or more covariates can be measured as the difference between the joint effect of covariates and the sum of their independent effects , or , in other words , the departure away from an additive model . in this paper , we focus on the power of model - based tests for the presence of interaction , under misspecified models .",
    "that is , with one kind of interaction model truly generating the data , another kind of interaction model is applied for estimation and testing purposes .",
    "our rationale for this is a suspicion that sometimes a wrong but parsimonious model for interactions may lead to better power for detecting departures from additivity than a complex model for interactions , even if the complex model is correct . to make comparisons tractable",
    ", we derive the asymptotic power of the test statistic under a sequence of pitman - type alternatives , which are getting closer to the null ( additive ) model as the sample size increases .    in section 2 , under a general framework",
    ", we give the asymptotic power function based on a misspecified model .",
    "the corresponding function for a correct model arises as a special case . in section 3",
    ", we apply the general results to a particular comparison between a pairwise interaction model ( pim ) and a diffuse interaction model ( dim ) .",
    "the latter was proposed by gustafson , kazi and levy ( 2005 ) as a parsimonious model for interactions appropriate for reflecting a general synergism or antagonism in how covariates interact , without identifying particular pairs of variables responsible .",
    "we find that when the dim is correct , the dim - based test for interaction is more powerful than the pim - based test , at least in all the specific scenarios we have considered .",
    "when , the pim is correct , however , the comparison is mixed .",
    "depending on the specific nature of the pairwise interactions , in terms of directions and relative magnitudes of coefficients , either the dim - based test or the pim - based test may be more powerful .",
    "in this section , we give a general result about the asymptotic power function of a wald ( quadratic form ) test for the presence of interactions , in the context of a misspecified model for the alternative distribution .",
    "in fact , the mathematical formalism is more general , in terms of describing an arbitrary testing scenario with model misspecification .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote two different parametric families of densities for modelling @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we consider fitting model @xmath5 to a sample of size @xmath6 , and testing the null hypothesis @xmath7 against a non - directional alternative , where @xmath8 is an @xmath9 matrix of full row rank .",
    "conversely , the true data - generating mechanism is taken to be a member of @xmath10 . to form a sequence of pitman - type alternatives ( le cam 1960 ) , the specific member of @xmath10 generating the data",
    "is taken to be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a scalar and @xmath13 is a vector of unit - length .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath14 for some @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "thus the extent of model misspecification and the extent of deviation from the null both diminish with @xmath6 .    for the two parametric families ,",
    "let @xmath17}/\\partial{\\btheta}\\ ] ] and @xmath18}/\\partial{\\bomega}\\ ] ] be the respective score vectors , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the respective fisher information matrices .",
    "note that here , and in what follows , expectations are with respect to the same fixed distribution of @xmath21 , and the distribution of @xmath22 based on a member of @xmath23 or @xmath24 , as indicated by a subscript .",
    "let @xmath25 be the maximum likelihood estimator based on fitting @xmath26 to @xmath6 observations arising from @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath28 is a wald test statistic , which would be asymptotically distributed as @xmath29 with @xmath30=rank@xmath31 degrees of freedom if the data were generated under the null ( i.e. , via some member of @xmath23 with @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , with data generated as @xmath27 , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the parameter vector which minimizes the kullback - leibler information criterion , that is @xmath34 note that the fact @xmath35 yields that @xmath36 .    by white ( 1982 ) we know that the first item on the right side of ( @xmath37 ) is asymptotically normal with mean @xmath38 and covariance matrix @xmath39 .",
    "so we only need to work on the second item . by ( [ kl ] )",
    "we know that @xmath33 satisfies @xmath40 based on gustafson ( 2001 ) , implicit differentiation of ( @xmath41 ) gives @xmath42\\frac{\\partial\\btheta_*}{\\partial\\bomega } + \\ee_{\\bomega}[s_f(\\btheta_*(\\bomega),y,\\bx)s^{t}_g(\\bomega;y,\\bx)]=0.\\ ] ] evaluated at @xmath43 , the above equality yields @xmath44 which is derived by the fact that @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath45 based on obrien _ et",
    "( 2006 ) , we apply ( [ secondterm ] ) in ( [ truedist ] ) .",
    "hence we have the asymptotic distribution of @xmath46 as noncentral @xmath47 , where the noncentrality parameter @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 in the case of a correctly specified model , i.e. , @xmath50 , this reduces to @xmath51 in either case , the asymptotic power of test statistic @xmath46 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the upper @xmath54 quantile of @xmath55 .",
    "greenland ( 1983 ) pointed out that the power of statistical tests to detect interactions is very low in some commonly encountered epidemiological situations .",
    "we certainly envision low power in situations where the number of covariates is rather large and only a very small fraction of all possible ( pairwise ) interaction terms really play a role .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed another kind of interaction model , the _ diffuse interaction _ model , to deal with difficulties caused by a large number of covariates under pairwise interaction models .",
    "the basic form of this model is best understood in the context of known effect directions .",
    "for instance , say @xmath56 represents a health outcome ( larger values worse ) , and each @xmath57 is a risk factor , scaled to be nonnegative , such that @xmath58 is known _ a priori _ to be non - decreasing in each @xmath57 .",
    "then the dim form is @xmath59 with @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "note that if @xmath62 can be interpreted as ` absence ' of the @xmath63-th risk factor , then @xmath64 can be interpreted as the effect of @xmath65 when all other risk factors are absent , regardless of the value of @xmath66 .",
    "assuming normal , homoscedastic errors with @xmath67 , @xmath68 comprise the @xmath69 unknown parameters in the dim .",
    "to interpret @xmath66 , note first that when @xmath70 , ( [ diffuse ] ) reduces to the usual additive model .",
    "if @xmath71 though , then the interaction is antagonistic , in the sense that for @xmath72 , @xmath73 is positive , but decreasing in each component of @xmath74 . in the special case where",
    "each @xmath65 is binary to indicate absence or presence of a risk factor , @xmath71 corresponds to the effect of a particular risk factor diminishing as other risk factors become present .",
    "conversely , @xmath75 corresponds to synergism with the effect growing as other risk factors become present .",
    "thus the dim ( [ diffuse ] ) allows for a general tendency for antagonism or synergism in how multiple risk factors operate on the outcome , without attempting to model fine structure of how such antagonism or synergism arises .",
    "that is , @xmath66 controls a one - parameter extension of an additive model which does not single out any particular subset of risk factors as being less or more responsible for interaction .",
    "the standard strategy for modelling interactions involves a pairwise - interaction model ( pim ) . again assuming normal , homoscedastic errors",
    ", @xmath76 comprises a model with @xmath77 parameters , @xmath78 .    to test for departures from additivity",
    "then , we could fit the dim and test the null that @xmath70 , or fit the pim and test the null that @xmath79 . in either case ,",
    "the same null model arises , i.e. , the additive model with @xmath80 unknown parameters @xmath81 .",
    "we can specify a distribution for @xmath82 , values for @xmath83 , and a choice of true alternative ( dim or pim ) , and then compute the asymptotic power for both the dim - based test and the pim - based test .",
    "when the true alternative is based on dim , we simply have @xmath84 ( since only a single parameter @xmath66 describes the departure from additivity ) . when the true alternative is based on pim",
    ", we must specify the @xmath85 elements of the unit - vector @xmath13 , i.e. , we must specify how the pairwise - interaction coefficients deviate from zero . thus investigating",
    "the power to detect interactions of pim form is necessarily more involved than in the dim case .",
    "note that in all cases the quantities needed to determine the asymptotic power are expectations of squares and cross products of score vectors for the two models .",
    "some calculations lack a closed - form due to the particular form of the score vector for the dim .",
    "the components of this score vector are given in appendix .",
    "it is the element corresponding to the partial derivative with respect to @xmath66 ( evaluated at @xmath70 ) that causes the difficulty in obtaining an analytical form .",
    "at least in situations where the distribution of @xmath82 is discrete , all expectations required can be calculated via analytic expectation ( for @xmath86 ) and finite summation for all possible values of @xmath21 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath21 follows some continuous distribution , the numerical integration is required .",
    "as one particular example , say that @xmath87 covariates are independent and identically distributed as bernoulli(0.5 ) .",
    "say that @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "asymptotic power curves ( power as a function of @xmath12 ) for the dim and pim tests , when the true alternative is dim , appear in figure @xmath90 .",
    "as might be anticipated , the dim test has substantially higher power , i.e. , one does better if one models the alternative hypothesis correctly .",
    "we find that this conclusion is maintained as we vary the number and distribution of covariates , and the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 . to some extent",
    "we can see this analytically .",
    "for instance , changing @xmath92 has the same effect of considering a different value of @xmath12 , as the noncentrality parameter in ( @xmath93 ) is proportional to @xmath94 .      to investigate power",
    "when the true alternative follows the pim , for now we keep the same distribution of @xmath82 and choice of @xmath95 as before , but must consider different possibilities for @xmath13 , the direction in which the pairwise - interaction coefficients deviate from zero . in an attempt to be somewhat comprehensive , we set up three _ primary factors _ as follows .",
    "factor 1 is the proportion of entries in @xmath13 which are non - zero . of the non - zero entries ,",
    "factor 2 is the proportion which are positive .",
    "specializing to the case that all positive entries share the same magnitude and all negative entries share the same magnitude , factor 3 is the ratio of the ( unique ) magnitude of the positive entries to the ( unique ) magnitude of the negative entries . under this specialization , and given the restriction @xmath96 , specifying the three factors does yield a specific value of @xmath13 , up to permutation . here",
    "the permutation we choose is @xmath97 .",
    "we consider three levels for each factor , particularly ( 0.2,0.5,0.8 ) for factor 1 and 2 , and ( 0.5,1,2 ) for factor 3 . in the following plots ( figures 2 through 4 ) , we refer to the three levels of each factor as _",
    "low , medium , high _ respectively .",
    "note first that if the level of factor 1 is not low and the levels of factors 2 and 3 are both high ( or both low ) , dim is be more powerful than pim .",
    "this point is indicated by the superiority of dim - based power curves in the two bottom left ( right ) panels in figure 2 ( figure 4 ) . in other words ,",
    "given a moderate to high presence of pairwise - interaction terms , if the proportion of the positive ( or negative ) pairwise terms with larger magnitudes overwhelms negative ( or positive ) ones , i.e. , the  overall \" interaction strength leans to synergism ( or antagonism ) , then dim works better .",
    "however , if the proportions of two opposite directions are almost equal and the magnitudes of two signs are almost equal as well , dim does not work well , as shown in the middle columns of figures 2 through 4 .    note also that the first column and third column are actually identical in figure @xmath98 .",
    "this is caused by the asymptotic power being an even function of @xmath12 , which can be immediately shown by ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "note then the primary factors of ( 0.2,0.8,1 ) with @xmath99 and the primary factors of ( 0.8,0.2,1 ) with @xmath100 give the same value of @xmath13 .    while figures 2 through 4 compare the dim and pim - based tests across different settings of the primary factors ,",
    "there are of course numerous secondary factors which might be varied as well .",
    "these include the number of covariates and their joint distribution , as well as the values of the main effect coefficients .",
    "as one example , figures 5 through 7 make comparisons as per figures 2 through 4 , but with the number of covariates doubled ( @xmath101 now ) . here",
    "we see more of a tendency for the dim - based test to compare favourably with the pim - based test , as we might expect .",
    "r code is available ( www.stat.ubc.ca/@xmath102gustaf ) to carry out the power comparison with primary and secondary factors set to levels desired by the user .",
    "we view our findings as lending some general support for the utility of models , such as the dim , which compromise between the simplicity of additivity and the flexibility of the pim . to elaborate",
    ", we do not claim that the dim will be highly realistic across a large range of problems , particularly in the restricted form considered here ( all effect directions known , interactive behaviour either completely synergistic or completely antagonistic ) .",
    "indeed , gustafson _ et .",
    "( 2005 ) extend the dim to unknown directions and liu ( 2007 ) considers more general dim forms whereby one group of covariates may have different interactive behaviour than another . even in the simple form presented here , however",
    ", the dim can capture some coarse structure of the regression relationship beyond additivity ( i.e. , a general tendency for synergistic or antagonistic combination of risk factors ) .",
    "in contrast , inference in the pim might be viewed as attempting to recover fine structure of nonadditive behaviour .",
    "the asymptotic power comparison of pim and dim - based tests is therefore a convenient way to quantify the extent to which coarse features of non - additivity are more easily detected than fine features .",
    "it seems interesting that under a true pim - structure , enough cohesion in the direction of the pairwise - term coefficients can render the dim - based test of non - additivity more powerful than the pim - based test .",
    "this matches the applied statistics intuition that often data will not inform very much about the nature of nonadditivity , hence a coarse descriptor , such as the single nonadditivity parameter in the simple dim , may be appropriate .",
    "one way in which our stylized treatment of the problem differs from applied practice is that we have considered the pim - based test comparing the additive model with no interactions to the full model with all possible pairwise interactions . in practice , particularly when @xmath103 is large , one might use a stepwise procedure which potentially seeks a model with a few pairwise interactions . or one might fit the full model and retain only those pairwise terms with significant coefficients . in either case ,",
    "multiple comparison issues are at play , and comparison with the dim - based approach would require a different strategy than that employed in the present paper .",
