    "with the discovery of a standard model - like higgs boson with a mass near 125 gev @xcite , experiments are for the first time directly probing the scale at which the electroweak symmetry is broken . at the same time",
    "the lhc has imposed impressive constraints on new states near the weak scale , placing increasing stress on conventional paradigms for natural electroweak symmetry breaking . in light of lhc limits ,",
    "a crucial question is whether there still remains room for natural mechanisms to stabilize the weak scale .",
    "a particularly interesting observation along these lines is that almost all constraints on conventional mechanisms for stabilizing the weak scale ( such as composite higgs models or supersymmetry ) hinge critically on the large production cross section for the colored partner particle(s ) of the top quark .",
    "the reason for this is simple : if the higgs is to be protected by a symmetry of some kind , then the top quark must also transform under this symmetry in order for the symmetry to be compatible with a large top yukawa coupling .",
    "popular realizations such as supersymmetry or global symmetries commute with qcd , which ensures that the top s partner particle(s ) must carry qcd quantum numbers as well .",
    "given the strong constraints on colored particles from the lhc , it is particularly important to systematically map out the exceptions to this ` top partner theorem ' , since the collider signatures of such exceptions fall in a qualitatively different regime which is still largely unexplored .    there",
    "exist several known loopholes in the top partner theorem , all of which hinge on accidental realizations of either a global symmetry ( as in twin higgs models @xcite and their relatives @xcite ) , or supersymmetry ( as in folded supersymmetry models @xcite ) .",
    "the question remains , however , whether these loopholes are theoretical curiosities or examples of a very general framework for protecting the weak scale without introducing new states charged under the standard model . in this paper",
    "we commence the systematic study of loopholes using global symmetries , and show that all the essential features neatly fit within the framework of field - theoretic orbifolds . as a consequence , we identify a large class of models of which the twin higgs is merely the simplest example . in all of our models ,",
    "a gauged symmetry group is broken by an orbifold projection , resulting in effective theories including the standard model sector plus one or more hidden sectors .",
    "crucially , the effective theory exhibits a continuous _ accidental _ symmetry relating the standard model and hidden sector(s ) , which suffices to protect the higgs mass from large quantum corrections .",
    "a central feature of this symmetry is that it only involves top partners that are _ neutral _ under the standard model interactions , thus evading the top partner theorem .",
    "more generally , _ all _ the important partner partners ( such as gauge partners of @xmath0 ) are neutral under the standard model .",
    "we argue that concrete realizations of this idea are strongly constrained by group theoretic considerations , and exploit this observation to initiate a systematic classification of these models .",
    "the most basic example of our class of models , consisting of a @xmath1 orbifold , coincides with the well - known twin higgs model . in this standard scenario @xcite",
    "the physical higgs is one out of @xmath2 goldstones arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath3 to @xmath4 , while the remaining @xmath5 are eaten by gauging an @xmath6 subgroup of the global @xmath3 .",
    "one of these @xmath7 nodes can then be identified with the standard model weak gauge group , while the other is its ` twin ' counterpart . gauging the @xmath6 subgroup",
    "necessarily constitutes an explicit breaking of the @xmath3 of which the higgs is supposed to be a goldstone boson .",
    "the higgs may nevertheless be protected at one loop , if the following criteria are satisfied :    * the @xmath3 is a symmetry of the quadratic and quartic parts of the tree - level higgs potential . *",
    "the @xmath3 is preserved in the quadratic part of the one - loop higgs potential .    in the twin higgs model ,",
    "the first criterion is an ad hoc assumption , while the latter is ensured by a discrete @xmath8 symmetry which interchanges both @xmath7 nodes .",
    "concretely , this discrete symmetry ensures that gauge and yukawa couplings of both groups must be equal , which implies that the leading contributions to the quadratic potential at one loop take the form @xmath9 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{16\\pi^2 } \\left ( \\frac{9}{4 } g^2 - 6 y_t^2 \\right ) \\left (   |h_a|^2+|h_b|^2\\right)\\label{quadraticpotential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts ` @xmath10 ' and ` @xmath11 ' denote the standard model and the twin sector respectively .",
    "equation ( [ quadraticpotential ] ) is manifestly @xmath3 invariant , and as such the sm - like higgs ( as a pseudo - goldstone of spontaneous @xmath3 breaking ) is insensitive to the cutoff at one loop .",
    "symmetry , as is expected of a uv completion such as compositeness or supersymmetry . ]",
    "while in the twin higgs paradigm both the @xmath8 and the accidental @xmath3 are somewhat artificial ingredients , we stress that both can be _ natural _ features from the viewpoint of orbifold higgs models . specifically , by viewing the twin higgs as the orbifold projection @xmath12 the global @xmath8 follows _ automatically_. the accidental @xmath3 may or may not follow automatically , depending on the spectrum of operators in the ultraviolet . as we will see , this framework can be naturally extended to include both the top quarks and the standard model @xmath4 group . even at the level of the twin higgs , framing the model in terms of a field theory orbifold",
    "is extremely useful . among other things",
    ", it helps to answer the question of how , precisely , the twin higgs can be distinguished from composite higgs models at the group theory level : the global symmetry breaking pattern is approximately @xmath13 , while the field content corresponds to @xmath14 ; this suffices to preserve the @xmath3 under modest radiative corrections , while eliminating partner states charged under the standard model and introducing a custodial symmetry .",
    "it is in this @xmath14 that the twin higgs differs crucially from its composite higgs cousins .    from a more formal point of view",
    ", the utility of orbifolds in controlling large quantum corrections may not be so surprising .",
    "in particular , it is well known that in the large-@xmath15 limit the correlation functions of a daughter theory obtained by orbifolding a mother theory must be identical to the correlation functions of the mother , up to a rescaling of the coupling constants @xcite . in the example of the orbifold higgs",
    ", one might expect that the higgs two - point correlation function must be identical ( up to possibly @xmath16-suppressed corrections ) to the two - point function in the mother theory , which does enjoy the full protection of the global @xmath3 .",
    "ultimately we will encounter important subtleties regarding orbifold correspondence in these models , but the conceptual inspiration provided by orbifold correspondence is extremely valuable .",
    "given that the proof provided in @xcite is valid beyond the simple example of a @xmath8 orbifold , the orbifold interpretation of the twin higgs opens up new possibilities for generalizing beyond this simple case . in fact we will see that the twin higgs is merely the tip of the iceberg and that a large class of qualitatively new models is waiting to be explored . in this respect ,",
    "orbifold field theories provide a framework for determining the complete generalization of the twin higgs mechanism .",
    "in this paper we elaborate on the schematic picture articulated in @xcite and develop the complete framework necessary to construct orbifold higgs models .",
    "we proceed as follows : section [ sec : general - features ] contains a model - independent analysis of a class of orbifolds by _ regular embeddings _ of a generic discrete group @xmath17 , providing a toolkit for the analysis carried out in later sections .",
    "we pay particular attention to the breaking of gauge and global symmetries , the rescaling of couplings , and the consequent accidental symmetries of daughter theories . in section [ sec : examples ] we analyze in detail a class of toy models resembling top - yukawa sectors .",
    "these examples feature all essential characteristics of phenomenological interest , and we will easily analyze both abelian and non - abelian orbifolds , building on techniques developed in section [ sec : general - features ] . in section [ sec : lsm ] we then study the vacuum of orbifold higgs models and trace how a standard model - like pseudo - goldstone higgs arises from symmetry breaking in sectors related by orbifold projection .",
    "section [ sec : uv - completions ] discusses realistic models , touching upon another interesting aspect of field - theoretic orbifolds , namely their amenability to higher - dimensional uv completions as _",
    "geometric _ orbifolds .",
    "finally , we discuss how phenomenology implies a surprising connection to low scale unification and conclude with discussion of future directions .",
    "a field - theoretic orbifold of a _ mother _ theory with a discrete symmetry @xmath17 consists of projecting onto states invariant under @xmath17 , a procedure also known as `` gauging @xmath17 '' . at the lagrangian level , the orbifold is realized by retaining field components which are @xmath17-invariant . in general this procedure will break both global and gauge symmetries of the mother theory . in this section",
    "we review the framework of field - theoretic orbifolds in detail and derive some general results which we will use in later sections , greatly simplifying the tasks of carrying out orbifolds and studying their low energy dynamics .",
    "the first main result of this section are the general formulae ( [ eq : symmetry - breaking ] ) , ( [ eq : surviving - gluons ] ) , ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) that provide a direct description of the _ daughter _ theories arising from a given mother theory and discrete symmetry @xmath17 .",
    "the second main point is a general analysis of the accidental symmetries of the higgs potential in the daughter theory .",
    "as we recalled in the introduction , the twin higgs model enjoys a realization as a @xmath1-orbifold .",
    "a considerable advantage of this realization is the fact that the @xmath3 accidental symmetry can arise naturally from the @xmath1 orbifold . in section [ sec : accidentalsym ]",
    "we will show that this crucial feature extends to field - theoretic orbifolds by a general discrete group @xmath17 .    as our objective is to establish the structure of an orbifold field theory for general group @xmath17 , the discussion in this section is necessarily somewhat technical .",
    "readers exclusively interested in the phenomenology of orbifold higgs models may proceed directly to section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "much of the material in this subsection is a review of known results ( see for example @xcite ) , nevertheless we take the opportunity to set our notation and emphasize a few points which are crucial for our story . given a theory with some gauge or flavor symmetry group @xmath18 , there can be several ways of taking the orbifold , depending on how @xmath17 acts on @xmath18 .",
    "we will follow @xcite and stick with the _ regular representation _ embedding - action on the vector spaces furnishing representations of @xmath18 . ] .",
    "recall that for a finite group @xmath19 of order @xmath20 , the regular representation is @xmath21 dimensional and simply describes the action of @xmath17 onto itself .",
    "concretely , one has a set of @xmath22 matrices acting as permutations on the group elements of @xmath17 , which are represented by @xmath21-dimensional normalized vectors with a single nonzero entry .",
    "there are @xmath21 such matrices , which we denote by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "the regular representation is reducible and enjoys the well - known decomposition @xmath25 where @xmath26 runs over all the irreps of @xmath17 and @xmath27 is the dimension of the irrep @xmath28 .",
    "this decomposition enjoys the special feature that the multiplicity of each irrep in ( [ eq : regular - decomposition ] ) equals its dimension , which will be essential for the rest of our story .",
    "moreover , note that the famous identity @xmath29 is a trivial consequence of ( [ eq : regular - decomposition ] ) .    with phenomenological applications in mind , we will restrict ourselves to embeddings of @xmath17 in @xmath30 for some positive integer @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , let us consider [ irrepdecom ]    ^s_n & : = _ n^s = _ _ n d _ r^s _ = (    ccc & & + & & + & &    ) .    fields @xmath31 and @xmath10 in the fundamental and adjoint representations of @xmath32 , respectively , transform under @xmath17 as @xmath33 the @xmath17-action is obviously reducible , and induces the following decomposition of the vector space @xmath34 of the fundamental representation @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath17 acts on the subspace @xmath37 through the irrep @xmath38 and leaves @xmath39 invariant .    in order to capture all the details of orbifolding , it turns out to be useful to introduce a multi - index notation , according to the patterns of symmetry breaking . letting @xmath40",
    "be the number of irreps of @xmath17 , we define the following multi - index @xmath10 , for the vector space @xmath34 :    & a ~(,a , ) \\ {    l = 1  n _ + a = 1  d_n + = 1  d _    ..    note that @xmath41 will only be a relevant index if @xmath17 is non - abelian .",
    "for example , taking @xmath42 there are @xmath21 one - dimensional irreps , hence the multi - indices span a=(,a),=1,  ,a=1,  n with @xmath41 being suppressed because @xmath43 .    the discrete group @xmath17 may be embedded in more than one gauge group , or both in gauge and flavor groups .",
    "for example consider a flavor group @xmath44 with @xmath45 a positive integer , and let @xmath46 be the vector space of the fundamental representation .",
    "@xmath17 acts reducibly , inducing the decomposition @xmath47 .",
    "correspondingly we introduce multi - indices    & m ~(,m , ) \\",
    "{    l = 1  n _ + m = 1  d_f + = 1  d _    ..    notice in particular that @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the same span as @xmath26 and @xmath41 from the orbifolding of the gauge group , while @xmath50 does not .",
    "having specified how @xmath17 acts on the fields in the class of theories of interest , we now turn to describing the @xmath17-invariant degrees of freedom singled out by the orbifold .    starting with gauge fields ,",
    "their invariant components under the @xmath17-action must obey @xmath51 the invariant gluons fall into two categories .",
    "the first type follows from a direct application of schur s lemma : @xmath52 since @xmath53 has the block - diagonal form exhibited in ( [ irrepdecom ] ) .",
    "the second type takes the form [ extrau1 ] b_b = _ _ d_n(b__d _ ) where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , ensuring that @xmath56 is hermitean and traceless , hence a generator of @xmath57 . specifically , these are just those elements of the cartan subalgebra of @xmath57 that commute with @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are precisely @xmath58 invariant photons of the @xmath59 type , generating @xmath60 .",
    "overall , for the regular embedding - type of orbifold , the gauge symmetry breaks to [ eq : symmetry - breaking ] su(n ) ( _ = 1^n_su(d _ n ) ) ( u(1 ) ) ^n_-1 .",
    "note how the symmetry breaking pattern is fully determined by group - theoretical properties of the orbifold group : each non - abelian factor corresponds to an irreducible representation of @xmath17 , with the dimensionality @xmath27 determining the corresponding rank . if @xmath61 is abelian , and therefore @xmath62 , then the rank of the daughter symmetry group as a whole equals the rank of the mother symmetry group . for non - abelian @xmath17 ,",
    "the rank of the daughter is always less than the rank of the mother . in what follows",
    "we will mainly focus on the non - abelian factors in ( [ eq : symmetry - breaking ] ) , while neglecting the abelian ones ; the physical motivations behind this choice are discussed in section [ sec : uv - completions ] . for later convenience",
    "we also express the surviving gluons in multi - index notation , as degrees of freedom of the mother theory [ eq : surviving - gluons ]    & a_a^b = ( a^())_a^ b_^_^ .    turning to matter fields in a generic representation @xmath63 of @xmath18 ,",
    "the projector onto the invariant subspace reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the matrix representation of @xmath66 . with an eye towards subsequent applications ,",
    "we will focus on a field in the bifundamental of @xmath67 . with the regular embedding described above , the @xmath17-action on such a field",
    "will be expressed by matrices , such that contraction with a fundamental @xmath68 yields an @xmath69 invariant @xmath70 . in our index notation",
    "we write @xmath71 .",
    "this explains the appearance of complex conjugation in ( [ eq : reg - bifund ] ) : in building a left - acting projection operator we think of both groups @xmath67 as acting from the left . ]",
    "[ eq : reg - bifund ] _",
    "nf^s = _ n^s(_f^s)^ * with @xmath72 and @xmath73 the regular embeddings of @xmath17 in the the two symmetry groups .",
    "according to the orthogonality theorem for matrix elements of irreducible representations , we may write the bifundamental projector as    [ projectoropp ] ( p_nf)_an^mb & = _ ^ ( _ n d_)_a^b ^_(_f d_)^m_n ( _ s ( r^s_)_^(r^s * _ ) ^ _ ) + & = _ ^^__a^b ^m_n _ ^ _ ^^ _    where in the first line we expressed the kronecker-@xmath74 symbols as unit matrices to highlight the fact that the span of the corresponding indices is actually @xmath26- ( resp .",
    "@xmath48- ) dependent .",
    "although the notation of the second line is somewhat abusive , we will often make use of it , keeping this remark in mind . from ( [ projectoropp ] )",
    "we can write down in full generality the invariant components of a bifundamental tensor @xmath75 [ eq : bifund - invt ]    ( ^())_(a,)^(m , ) : = ( p_nf)_an^mb _ b^n & = _",

    ",fd_. this is where the role of multi - indices as a valuable book - keeping device becomes manifest : in expression ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) we can read off _ directly _ how invariant field components transform under the symmetries of the daughter theory . in particular ,",
    "besides the breaking of the gauge symmetry described above in ( [ eq : symmetry - breaking ] ) , we now find a similar breaking pattern for the flavor symmetry as well [ eq : flavor - breaking ] su(f ) ( _ = 1^n_su(d _ f ) ) ( u(1 ) ) ^n_-1 .",
    "this simple example is conveniently summarized in figure [ fig : simplequiver ] .",
    "the orbifold establishes a precise relation between the couplings of the mother theory and those of the daughter theory . in this section",
    "we analyze the scaling of various types of couplings of interest to us .",
    "we will mainly be interested in applications involving a gauge theory with matter fields transforming as bi - fundamentals of two symmetry groups in which @xmath17 is embedded through the regular representation ( or in slightly different setups which happen to share the same conclusions ) .    from the general formulae ( [ eq : surviving - gluons ] ) and ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) it is clear that each mother field will descend to a daughter field for each irrep of @xmath17 , labeled by @xmath26 .",
    "kinetic terms of the mother theory s lagrangian generally descend to _ unnormalized _ kinetic terms for daughter fields , inducing a canonical rescaling of the field strengths ; this is the underlying mechanism driving a corresponding rescaling of all couplings .    in particular , we can read off the scaling factors introduced by the projection :    * every bi - fundamental comes with a coefficient @xmath76 * gauge fields do not come with any multiplicative factor * each trace contributes in ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) is responsible for this factor . ]",
    "a coefficient @xmath27 .    with these in mind",
    ", it is easy to see how various operators in the mother theory project down to the daughter :    ^ & ^()^ ( ) + m ^ & ^()^ ( ) + ( ^)^2 & ( ^ ( ) ^())^2 + ^^ & ^()^()^()^ ( ) + y  & ^ ( ) ^()^ ( ) + ff&f^()f^ ( ) .    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are bi - fundamental fields of the mother theory , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the corresponding daughter fields attached to the @xmath26-th node .",
    "sums over repeated greek indices are understood .",
    "finally , upon restoring the canonical normalization of the kinetic terms , the various coupling constants in the daughter theory must therefore be rescaled as follows :    [ eq : rescalecoupling ] mm y & + & g .",
    "the rescaling of the gauge and yukawa couplings may therefore be different for different sectors in the daughter theory , a feature that will play a crucial role in the realization of the accidental symmetry we are after .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .      now that we have seen how various couplings rescale , we are in a position to try and say something general about the symmetries of a daughter theory .",
    "our daughter theories can typically be described by a quiver structure ( such as the one in figure [ fig : simplequiver ] ) involving gauge nodes with possibly different ranks , as dictated by the dimensionality of @xmath17-irreps .",
    "this pattern extends to global symmetries as well . as a consequence",
    "we can say that generally the daughter theory will enjoy a _ new kind _ of discrete symmetry @xmath81 , which is simply the symmetry group of the tuple of positive integers d = ( d_1,d_2,  ,d_n _ ) .",
    "for example , in the case that @xmath82 , all @xmath83 are @xmath84 and the symmetry group of the quiver is simply @xmath85 .",
    "another example is @xmath86 for which there are three irreps of dimension @xmath84 , and one irrep of dimension @xmath87 , hence resulting in a quiver with an @xmath88 symmetry group permuting the three `` sectors '' corresponding to @xmath89 .",
    "the origin of @xmath81 should be clear : an @xmath57 symmetry of the mother theory has a weyl subgroup @xmath90 , which gets broken by the orbifold to ( _ s_d_n ) _ d with each factor in the product being a weyl subgroup of @xmath91 , and the @xmath81 acting by permutations of different sectors ( with @xmath92 ) .",
    "each symmetry of the mother thus contains such an @xmath81 subgroup .",
    "however , the daughter theory only has a _ single _",
    "@xmath81 acting `` diagonally '' , i.e. permuting all nodes and bifundamentals at once ( see figure [ fig : simplequiver ] ) . the explanation comes simply from the projection of bi - fundamental fields : the @xmath93 in ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) is what singles out the diagonal _ d",
    "^(n)_d ^(f)_d  su(n ) su(f ) .",
    "the effects of @xmath81 are also clear : labeling sectors of the daughter theory by @xmath94 , for any two sectors @xmath95 with @xmath92 , the quantum action will be invariant under switching the labels @xmath96 on all involved daughter fields . to give an example ,",
    "any two fields @xmath97 descending from the same mother field @xmath98 are guaranteed to have equal masses to all orders in perturbation theory m_^()=m_^ ( ) .",
    "in the special case where @xmath99 , the @xmath81 is precisely the @xmath8 symmetry that protects the higgs mass in the twin higgs model .",
    "while for certain orbifolds ( such as @xmath82 ) the manifest @xmath81 constraint is a powerful one , more general discrete groups will feature irreps of various different dimensions , curtailing the effectiveness of @xmath81 .",
    "surprisingly , another less manifest , but farther reaching feature of orbifolds plays an analogous role .",
    "in addition to the exact discrete symmetry , orbifold models  with a caveat to be stated presently  also enjoy an accidental _ continuous symmetry_.    more precisely , in a generic mother theory with bi - fundamental scalars @xmath75 of @xmath67 , the scalar potential will feature the following operators [ eq : mother - operators ] ^_m^a _ a^m , ( ^_m^a _ a^m ) ^2 , _ m^a _ a^n ^_n^b _ b^m , whose orbifold projections readily follow from ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) : @xmath100 where daughter fields have been canonically rescaled . now",
    "the rhs of ( [ eq : newinvariant ] ) can be seen to enjoy a large , continuous symmetry .",
    "note from ( [ eq : indexspan ] ) that the field @xmath101 has @xmath102 independent components , then recalling the identity @xmath103 , we see that the rhs of ( [ eq : newinvariant ] ) is in fact ) is an invariant of @xmath104 , the effect of the orbifold is to reduce the number of @xmath98-components by a factor of @xmath21 , naturally breaking the symmetry to @xmath105 . ]",
    "an invariant of [ eqn : accidentalsym ] _ acc = su ( n f ) . on the other hand ( [ eq :",
    "quartic - single - trace - projected ] ) breaks @xmath106 .",
    "hence the caveat is that @xmath106 is only realized in those theories for which the single - trace quartic operator is either absent entirely or much smaller than the double - trace quartic .",
    "we refer to @xmath106 as an _ accidental _ symmetry , since it holds at tree level , and is neither preserved by possible gauge interactions nor by possible single - trace quartics of ( [ eq : quartic - single - trace - projected ] ) .",
    "we mention _ en passant _ that quite generally for the models we will consider , @xmath106 is a symmetry of the whole quadratic action ( not just for the scalars ) , although this fact will not play a role in the rest of this paper .",
    "we now come to the most important feature of @xmath106 : while it is natural to expect that it be broken by one - loop corrections of the form shown in figure [ fig : quadratic ] , surprisingly this is not the case for the two - point function ! in fact , with gauge interactions turned on , one would expect that @xmath107 and @xmath108 would get corrected differently , in particular when @xmath109 .",
    "however at this point something special happens : _ the @xmath27 dependence from the casimir cancels against the @xmath27 dependence from the rescaling of the gauge coupling in ( [ eq : rescalecoupling ] ) , up to a @xmath110 suppressed correction .",
    "_ concretely , the contribution to the one - loop effective potential from gauge loops is given by    [ eq : effaction ] v_eff & _",
    "= 1^n_()^2|^()|^2 ^ 2 + & = g^2 n ( _ = 1^n_|^()|^2 ) ^2 - ( _ = 1^n_|^()|^2)^2 .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : effaction ] ) is again manifestly @xmath111 symmetric , while from the second term we find a parametrically small breaking of @xmath106 , of the order m^2 ~   ( 1 - ) where @xmath112 is understood to be the irrep of @xmath17 of largest dimension , and we used the fact that any group @xmath17 always admits an irrep of dimension one .",
    "amusingly , in the @xmath82 case ( which includes the twin higgs ) , this term vanishes exactly , affording an even softer breaking of @xmath106 .",
    "the roots of this crucial result reach deep into the nature of field - theoretic orbifolds : a general theorem asserts that in the large-@xmath15 limit the correlation functions of a daughter theory should be identical to those of the mother , up to the usual rescaling of the coupling constants @xcite . in particular , the different mass terms @xmath113 of daughter fields should all be expected to converge to the mother s @xmath114 operator in the large @xmath15 limit , compatibly with ( [ eq : effaction ] ) .",
    "for the sake of clarity , it should be noted that such correspondence does not necessarily entail a full - fledged duality of the two theories .",
    "more precisely , the necessary and sufficient conditions for an actual orbifold equivalence were worked out in @xcite , and may be violated in some of our models .",
    "this nevertheless does not affect our conclusions , which revolve around the dynamics of the daughter theories , rather than on their putative equivalence to mother theories .    for the quartic potential the situation is different :",
    "although it is @xmath106-invariant at tree - level , the symmetry is radiatively spoiled for this operator .",
    "this can be easily seen : noting that    ( ^)^2 & ( _ ^()^ ( ) ) ^2 + = & _ ( ^()^())^2 + _ ( ^()^())(^()^ ( ) ) ,    at one loop the first sum in the second line gets corrections from gauge interactions as illustrated in figure [ fig : quartic ] , while no such corrections occur for the second sum .",
    "this undemocratic treatment of terms is what spoils the symmetry .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the above statement about the large @xmath15 limit of correlation functions , since the orbifold correspondence derived in @xcite only applies to single trace operators .",
    "our analysis of the relevant aspects of field - theoretic orbifolds is now complete . before turning to applications ,",
    "let us recollect them in the form of a `` toolkit '' , of which we will make extensive use later .",
    "the recipe goes as follows :    * identify the irreps of @xmath17 , hence the canonical decomposition of the regular representation ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : regular - decomposition ] ) ) . *",

    "these considerations  just direct consequences of standard representation theory  clearly carry over to all matter fields of the mother theory .",

    "we hope to have convinced the reader , by means of the analysis in sections [ sec : abelian - toy ] and [ sec : s3-toy ] , of just how straightforward it is to `` carry out '' orbifolds in the regular representation with bifundamental matter .",
    "nevertheless , a generalization beyond bifundamentals  while probably uninteresting for orbifold higgs models  is clearly possible , and in principle straightforward to carry out : the main extra difficulty is that ( [ projectoropp ] ) would not be valid in general , but this is easily fixed by the explicit knowledge of the irreps of @xmath17 , which would allow the construction of explicit projectors .      although straightforward applications of standard orbifold technology , some of the technicalities of the notation in section [ sec : general - features ] may obscure the simple nature of orbifold higgs models .",
    "nevertheless the overall lessons are both general and simple , and in this section we recollect them into a practical model - builder s guide to orbifold higgs models .    generally speaking , for any given @xmath17 all that is needed to write down the daughter model is really the tuple @xmath180 of dimensionalities of @xmath17-irreps . these can be usually obtained by means of standard representation theory , or simply from the math literature .",
    "much of the structure of orbifold higgs models is encoded into this simple data , as follows    * the model has one sector for each @xmath17-irrep * the @xmath26-th sector includes @xmath181 gauge nodes , as well as an @xmath182 flavor node * each sector contains a single bi - fundamental fermion ( @xmath183 ) , together with a flavor @xmath27-plet of scalars ( @xmath142 ) in the fundamental of @xmath184 , and another flavor @xmath27-plet of fermions ( @xmath185 ) in the anti - fundamental of @xmath186 * the gauge and yukawa couplings of each sector satisfy @xmath187 * the tree - level higgs potential is ( approximately ) @xmath123 symmetric , this follows from the orbifold picture  with the caveat that the single trace quartic operator in ( [ eq : mother - operators ] ) be subdominant or absent in the mother theory .",
    "these basic properties then ensure that the accidental symmetry is automatically preserved for the two - point function of the @xmath142 at one loop .",
    "moreover it is guaranteed that the model descends from an orbifold projection of a theory of the form shown in table [ tab : mothertheory ] , providing a natural avenue to a possible uv completion .",
    "one last nice feature worth keeping in mind is that every discrete group @xmath61 has at least one irrep of dimension one , namely the trivial representation : this means that every orbifold higgs model is guaranteed to contain at least one sector which can be identified with the standard model . when the @xmath142 acquire vacuum expectation values , the standard model - like higgs may then be identified as a pseudo - goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken accidental symmetry .",
    "finally we would like to stress that , while the examples considered in sections [ sec : abelian - toy ] and [ sec : s3-toy ] are just the two simplest applications , the scope of applicability of our formalism clearly extends well beyond them , and we hope these techniques will prove useful in future investigations of related ideas .",

    "thus we arrive at a theory with a parametrically light sm - like pseudo - goldstone higgs , a second pseudo - goldstone mode primarily aligned with the non - sm weak sectors and heavier by an amount @xmath219 , and a heavy radial mode .    as in any global symmetry scheme for a light higgs ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath220 relative to @xmath204 is set by phenomenological considerations .",
    "the sm - like higgs is rotated away from alignment with the sm vacuum expectation value by an amount @xmath221 , leading to higgs coupling deviations of the same order .",
    "the collective @xmath222 precision of lhc higgs coupling measurement suggests @xmath223 .",
    "if the smallness of @xmath220 is explained by soft breaking of the @xmath155 as described above , this corresponds to a modest @xmath224 tuning in the potential ",
    "exceedingly natural by current standards .",
    "the sense in which the gauge bosons and fermions of the non - sm sectors play the role of conventional partner particles despite not carrying standard model quantum numbers can be made explicit by integrating out the radial mode and studying the induced couplings of these states to the sm - like higgs .",
    "integrating out @xmath225 gives rise , for example , to interactions of the form @xmath226 precisely the form of top partner couplings expected from a pseudo - goldstone higgs , with the wrinkle that the role of top partner is shared in part by top quarks of two different sectors .",
    "although we have focused here on @xmath189 , the generalization to @xmath227 is straightforward .",
    "there are @xmath228 uneaten pseudo - goldstone states ; soft or hard breaking of the @xmath229 allows @xmath205 and one pseudo - goldstone to be identified with the sm - like higgs . in the case of soft breaking ,",
    "the tree - level tuning required for @xmath205 decreases with increasing @xmath21 @xcite , though even for @xmath230 the apparent tuning is nominal .",
    "the remaining @xmath231 pseudo - goldstones are heavier by an amount @xmath232 and mostly aligned with non - sm weak sectors , while the roles of partner states are played by admixtures of states in the various non - sm sectors .",
    "more exotic cases such as @xmath233 proceed along similar lines . here",
    "there are modest radiative perturbations to the structure of the potential since there are three sectors but the exact discrete symmetry of the daughter theory is only @xmath234 .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that radiative quartics in the @xmath3 sector are half as large as those in the @xmath7 sector .",
    "the relative rescaling of gauge and yukawa couplings for sectors of different size @xmath27 ensures that radiative corrections to the quadratic potential ( proportional to @xmath235 and @xmath236 at one loop ) remain the same between sectors , but consequently implies that radiative corrections to the quartic potential ( proportional to @xmath237 and @xmath238 at one loop ) differ .",
    "similarly , the @xmath16-suppressed mass corrections introduce additional perturbations to the potential .",
    "the quartic perturbation serves to align the @xmath158-breaking vev primarily with the @xmath3 gauge sector , while the mass perturbation may work in either direction depending on the sign of the cutoff @xmath239 for gauge loops and depends on the details of the uv completion . in any event ,",
    "numerically the quartic dominates to give the @xmath3 gauge sector a larger share of the @xmath158-breaking order parameter than the @xmath7 gauge sectors .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath227 case , the breaking of the approximate global @xmath158 symmetry does not lead to the complete breaking of the gauged @xmath3 , but rather leaves behind an unbroken @xmath4 gauge group .",
    "this residual group may confine depending on the sign of the beta function or be higgsed upon confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the accompanying @xmath163 color group .",
    "there are now ten uneaten pseudo - goldstones , of which eight combine to form an approximate two - higgs - quadruplet model of the @xmath3 gauge sector . without further perturbation of the potential ,",
    "the remaining pair of pseudo - goldstones arrange into maximally - mixed combinations of states in the two @xmath7 gauge sectors .",
    "a further perturbation of the potential by hard or soft @xmath234-breaking terms results in one pseudo - goldstone mode being identified with the sm - like higgs . as in the case of @xmath227 ,",
    "the role of the top partner is played by a collection of top quarks in the non - sm sectors , albeit now including states charged under an @xmath163 color group ! for these states",
    "the multiplicity and top yukawa scale precisely in tandem to cancel the quadratic sensitivity of the standard model top loop : the color trace now gives a factor of six , but the top yukawa - squared is scaled down by a factor of 2 .",
    "_ while this example may seem baroque , it provides  to our knowledge  the first concrete example of a natural theory based on symmetries where the relative multiplicity and coupling of top partners is scaled in such a way as to preserve cancellation of quadratic divergences at one loop . _",
    "up to this point we have focused on toy models to illustrate how the orbifold higgs can protect the weak scale from radiative corrections related to the top and weak gauge sectors of the standard model . in this section",
    "we illustrate how these toy examples can be extended to complete models with all the features of the standard model . in general , any realistic model building effort necessarily breaks up into two parts :    1 .",
    "write down the ` core ' of the model which consists of the non - abelian gauge fields and @xmath119 , @xmath31 and @xmath120 . as was discussed in section [ sec : examples ] , this step is close to trivial and fully specified by the choice of orbifold group .",
    "2 .   dress the core model with the hypercharge interactions and the remaining standard model fields .",
    "viable models typically include ingredients that do not transform as irreducible representations of the mother symmetry . from the four - dimensional perspective",
    "these correspond to introducing incomplete multiplets , which naturally arise in geometric orbifolds or deconstructions thereof . in this step",
    "the model builder will have to make a number of choices , as we will see in the remainder of this section .    while detailed treatment of uv completions is beyond the scope of this work , here we will discuss qualitative features of possible geometric constructions and summarize a few possible options for incorporating standard model hypercharge .      as explained in the introduction , the orbifold higgs boils down to a linear @xmath240-model where the higgs is identified with a pseudo - goldstone boson of an accidental symmetry of the quadratic action .",
    "this linear @xmath240-model should be uv completed at a scale @xmath241 , where the full symmetry of the mother theory is assumed to be largely restored .",
    "any hierarchy problems in the mother theory above the cutoff may be solved in the usual ways , such as supersymmetry or compositeness , without observable consequences below the cutoff .",
    "a straightforward way to obtain such a uv completion is through the geometric interpretation of the orbifold in a model with extra space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "not only does the geometric orbifold naturally provide a justification for the presence of the accidental symmetries of the low energy effective action , it also provides a mechanism for introducing incomplete multiplets of the mother symmetry through states localized on lower - dimensional defects of the higher - dimensional theory .",
    "this permits , for example , the introduction of first- and second - generation standard model fermions without corresponding partners in other sectors . among other things",
    ", this alleviates the tension of the conventional twin higgs with cosmology by reducing the number of light species .",
    "ultraviolet completions of @xmath8 orbifolds in terms of the dimensional reduction of a five - dimensional theory on an interval with non - trivial boundary conditions are well understood in the context of scherk - schwarz supersymmetry breaking @xcite and gut model building @xcite . _",
    "a priori _ there are several ways in which orbifold higgs models can be embedded in these uv completions .",
    "perhaps the simplest possibility is to consider a single non - trivial @xmath8 which is enough to obtain the desired pattern of symmetry breaking in a non - supersymmetric context . in supersymmetric models such",
    "a setup is moreover sufficient break n=2 supersymmetry down to n=1 , but some additional soft supersymmetry breaking is needed to break the remaining n=1 supersymmetry . in this case",
    "the low energy theories are generalizations of the supersymmetric twin higgs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could consider traditional scherk - schwartz supersymmetry breaking , with non - trivial orbifolds on both boundaries , such that the n=2 supersymmetry is fully broken without the need for additional soft terms . in this case",
    "the gauge & global symmetries may be broken on one or both boundaries , and the low energy theories are generalizations of folded supersymmetry @xcite . for simplicity , we set aside supersymmetry here and restrict ourselves to simplest case with a single non - trivial @xmath8 orbifold . as was mentioned before , any fields which only fit in representations of the daughter but not in representations of the mother can be localized on the boundary where the symmetry is reduced .",
    "as an alternative to placing all fields with twin partners in the bulk , one could also consider placing some on the symmetric boundary .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath119 and @xmath120 fields such a setup no longer requires the additional global symmetry su(2 ) symmetry , since all degrees of freedom of these boundary fields already appear in the low energy theory .",
    "an interesting consequence is that now the dreaded single trace quartic for @xmath119 can not arise .",
    "for genuine @xmath131 orbifolds ( with @xmath242 ) , however , there is no geometric action on @xmath243 yielding fixed points , and one is forced to consider at least a six - dimensional setup , where @xmath131 orbifolds can naturally arise from conical singularities .",
    "a simple possibility is to consider @xmath244 with @xmath133 acting by rotations on @xmath245 ; the poles of the 2-sphere are then the fixed orbifold points . more generally , it may be possibe to realize @xmath246 orbifolds geometrically by exploiting the @xmath247 action on an @xmath248-sphere . concretely ,",
    "considering the unit sphere in @xmath249 , @xmath250 we may take the @xmath246 to act by a permutation on the ambient coordinates @xmath251 .",
    "again we find two antipodal orbifold points : @xmath252    it is worth emphasizing that geometric completions provide a natural context for lifting any unwanted @xmath196 gauge groups via the stueckelberg mechanism , as alluded to in previous sections .",
    "this would consist of a generalized green - schwarz mechanism in a higher - dimensional theory , and may give mass to both anomalous and non - anomalous @xmath196 gauge fields @xcite ( for a nice discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath196 factors are lifted in this way , they leave behind @xmath196 global symmetries in the infrared , which in turn induce selection rules governing yukawa couplings .",
    "note that in all the cases we have considered , the top yukawa is automatically compatible with such selection rules .",
    "it is also possible to realize the physics of geometric orbifolds in a purely four - dimensional context through dimensional deconstruction @xcite .",
    "the bulk physics is reproduced by some number of sites possessing the gauged parent symmetry group , while defect physics is reproduced by a single site with only the daughter symmetries gauged .",
    "for example , the simple @xmath253 /\\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] orbifold can be reproduced by a simple two - site model where one site consists of an @xmath254 gauge group and the other of an @xmath255 ^ 2 $ ] gauge group , higgsed down to a diagonal @xmath255 ^ 2 $ ] group by the vacuum expectation values of scalars transforming as bi - fundamentals of the two sites .",
    "generically third generation fermions should be charged under the parent site , while first- and second - generation fermions can be charged under the daughter site .",
    "provided the gauge couplings of the parent site are much smaller than the gauge couplings of the daughter site , the gauge couplings of the diagonal massless @xmath255 ^ 2 $ ] gauge bosons will be largely inherited from the parent couplings .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to generalize this construction to other abelian orbifolds , including orbifold reduction of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge only abelian orbifolds have been reproduced by dimensional deconstruction ; it should also be possible  and quite interesting  to deconstruct non - abelian orbifolds as well .",
    "once we committed to a choice of orbifold group and geometry , what remains to be done is to add the hypercharge interactions and the remaining matter fields subject to considerations of anomaly cancellation . for simplicity , in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath8 orbifold with the understanding that the key features can be readily generalized to generic @xmath17 , and @xmath5 dimensions . ] in a rather straightforward manner , by means of the constructions discussed in previous sections .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath8 orbifolds enjoy a natural geometric realization on @xmath256 and such constructions are automatically anomaly free provided the 4d low energy theory is anomaly free @xcite . to incorporate hypercharge interactions , first note that a @xmath196 gauge symmetry of the mother theory would survive the orbifold intact ( as is evident from ( [ eq : gluon - orbifold ] ) ) and",
    "therefore it follows that all fields in the daughter theory would be charged under it .",
    "this scenario is highly constrained by direct searches for states coupling through the @xmath257 ; heavy @xmath258s ; and heavy stable charged particles , and for simplicity we do not pursue this option any further .",
    "an attractive and viable alternative is for the hypercharge group to arise in the daughter theory from orbifolding a non - abelian gauge group ( recall the extra @xmath196 factors in ( [ eq : symmetry - breaking ] ) , which we have thus far neglected ) , in which case the dark sectors do not necessarily need to carry hypercharge quantum numbers .",
    "however in this scenario , the fact that q must be a bifundamental ( for the reasons discussed in section [ sec : bifundamentals ] ) demands that at least one of the generators contributing to hypercharge must be embedded in the non - abelian groups from which the color and weak isospin groups ultimately descend .",
    "factors in the daughter theory , which is tightly constrained if additional @xmath196 bosons remain massless . in general",
    ", low - scale embedding of @xmath196 factors into non - abelian groups leads to vanishing kinetic mixing , though in uv complete models splittings in unified multiplets may give rise to suppressed contributions @xcite . while kinetic mixing is extremely small at the level of the daughter theories and may be rendered entirely innocuous by lifting additional @xmath196 factors with the stueckelberg mechanism , it would be interesting to study kinetic mixing in uv complete theories with low - scale unified embeddings to see if constraints are naturally satisfied for additional massless @xmath196 s . ] in other words , the phenomenology of these models enforces ( partial ) gauge coupling unification !",
    "interestingly , ultra low scale ( @xmath259 tev ) gauge coupling unification may be achieved rather easily in higher dimensional models @xcite in what follows , we merely assume gauge coupling unification at a scale below the cut - off of the 5d model . with this assumption ,",
    "we sketch several possible ways by which a more complete model may be achieved , without attempting to provide an exhaustive list .",
    "in particular , we restrict ourselves to the ` minimal ' setup , where only the third generation is required to reside in the bulk , while the first two generations are confined on the standard model brane .      consider a mother @xmath260 gauge theory in the bulk , for which there are 4 @xmath196 s surviving the orbifolding procedure : two come from decomposing the unitary groups into a product of the @xmath196 with a special unitary group , while the other two @xmath196 s are of the type in ( [ eq : symmetry - breaking ] ) . concretely , in a suitable choice of basis the generators read @xmath261 where the subscripts on the generators denote which unitary group in the mother theory they descend from .",
    "needless to say , they only act non - trivially on the subspace on which their corresponding gauge group in the mother theory acts .",
    "the following linear combination of generators reproduces the correct standard model hypercharge with zero charge for the fields in the twin sector : @xmath262 note that to preserve charge quantization , we implicitly assumed gauge coupling unification in ( [ uxuhypercharge ] ) .",
    "the remaining linear combinations may be lifted with the stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "interestingly , in this model , the hypercharge assignments of all the bulk fields are fully fixed by their representations under the @xmath260 in the bulk .",
    "it is therefore not possible to add the rest of the standard model to the bulk and we must localize these fields on the standard model brane . the standard model sector is anomaly free by construction , but the twin sector is not .",
    "this can be addressed by defect - localizing some spectator states charged under the dark gauge groups , without spoiling the one loop protection of the higgs .    finally , observe that the @xmath263 generator trivially commutes with all other generators , and plays the role of the baryon number in the mother theory .",
    "while standard model baryon number in the daughter theory is violated , @xmath264 is preserved , with @xmath11 and @xmath265 the baryon number in standard model and the twin sector respectively .",
    "this implies that neutron / anti - neutron oscillations are always forbidden .",
    "the proton on the other hand may decay , but only to a final state carrying hidden sector baryon number .",
    "generically , we expect the lightest twin baryon to be heavier than the proton , in which case proton decay is kinematically forbidden . even if this is not the case , the proton decay to the twin sector would occur through a dimension 12 operator , and since the proton degrees of freedom are confined on the brane , the decay would have to occur through mixing with the third generation .",
    "the high dimensionality of the operator in combination with the ckm suppression ensures that the bounds on invisible proton decay from the sno experiment @xcite are easily evaded , even if the dark baryons are lighter than the proton .",
    "another simple alternative is to consider a generalization of pati - salam unification @xcite . concretely , consider the orbifold @xmath266 ^ 2 \\times u(1)^3.\\ ] ] each pati - salam factor in the daughter will then provide its own hypercharge gauge group after the usual breaking to @xmath267 , ensuring that the twin states are dark under the standard model hypercharge . also here",
    "the additional @xmath196 factors are lifted with a stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "the matter content of a single generation plus twin particles fits in a ( * 8*,| , ) ( |*8 * , , ) ( * 4*,| , ) _ ( |*4*,,)_(*4*,| , ) _",
    "( |*4 * , , ) _ while two higgs fields with opposite hypercharge plus their twin partners fit in ( , , | ) ( , , | ) _ ( , , | ) _ in the pati - salam setup a two higgs doublet model is therefore a natural possibility and in this case and all third generation standard model representations may be put in the bulk . both the twin and the sm sectors",
    "are then anomaly free by construction .",
    "although the pati - salam gauge sector does not commute with baryon number , the latter is nevertheless preserved in all low energy processes if the pati - salam symmetry is broken down to the standard model by a gut orbifold mechanism . for the hidden sector",
    "decays , the argument from the @xmath268 model can then be generalized to the effective baryon number of the pati - salam setup . for low scale pati - salam models ,",
    "there furthermore are a number of interesting constraints from rare meson decays , which probe unification scales as high as @xmath269 tev , if all generations reside in the bulk .",
    "( for a recent update on these constraints , see @xcite and references therein . ) in the orbifold higgs scenario it however suffices that the only the third generation resides in the bulk , in which case we expect the constraints on the unification scale to be substantially weaker . while we do not attempt it here",
    ", a more detailed analysis of the flavor constraints would be interesting .",
    "a final example consists of a similar generalization of trinification @xcite .",
    "concretely , consider the breaking pattern su(6)su(6)su(6)/_2 ^2 u(1)^3 as in the pati - salam case , one copy of the trinification group will break to the standard model group , and the other to its twin .",
    "this again insures a private hypercharge for the standard model . in this a case full generation plus",
    "twin is contained in ( , | , ) ( , , | ) ( | , , ) the trinification representations support a two higgs doublet model in the bulk and both the standard model and the twin sector are again anomaly free by construction .",
    "a slightly unpleasant feature of this construction is that the lepton yukawa of the generation that resides in the bulk is forbidden by the @xmath270 gauge symmetry .",
    "this implies that this yukawa must arise from a an irrelevant operator involving some boundary - localized spurions that break the bulk gauge symmetry . the argument for the absence of proton decay and neutron",
    "/ anti - neutron oscillations is analogous to the argument given for the @xmath268 model .",
    "note that both the trinification and pati - salam setup each contribute one dark neutrino to the hidden sector , as well as a dark sterile neutrino . to prevent the dark neutrino from contributing to @xmath271",
    "one would have to ensure that it is lifted by the sterile neutrino , sufficiently weakly coupled to fall out of thermal equilibrium at an early stage , or cooled relative to the standard model bath by preferential reheating in the standard model sector .",
    "in this paper we have constructed a general class of models where the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson in an orbifolded gauge theory .",
    "the key feature is the relation between a theory and its orbifold - daughters , which imbues the orbifold daughter with the precise couplings and discrete symmetries necessary to realize an accidental symmetry of the quadratic action and identify the standard model - like higgs as a corresponding pseudo - goldstone .",
    "the components of an orbifold higgs model that are relevant for naturalness are fully determined by the group theoretical properties the orbifold group . as such",
    ", we provide a complete classification of such ` model fragments ' consisting out of the higgs and the top quarks : every orbifold group corresponds to a unique quiver which is fully specified by the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the orbifold group .",
    "the twin higgs model fits in this framework as the particular case of a @xmath8 orbifold . besides providing a generalization of twin higgs ,",
    "a considerable advantage of the orbifold interpretation is a natural explanation for the accidental symmetries playing a crucial role ; such symmetries ( in particular @xmath3 ) would be an ad - hoc feature in a pure twin higgs setup .",
    "while continuous symmetries of the quartic are also not guaranteed by the orbifold procedure , they provide a clear indication of the dynamics required for a viable uv completion ( namely dominance of the double - trace quartic in the parent theory ) .",
    "another bonus related to the geometric interpretation is an elegant mechanism for reducing tension with cosmological observables , by localizing the light standard model degrees of freedom on the orbifold fixed points .",
    "the reader may reasonably complain that generalizations beyond the abelian orbifolds are baroque and introduce numerous complications , including potential ( modest ) cutoff sensitivity at one loop and possible cosmological complications from the abundance of light non - abelian gauge bosons . while this may be so",
    ", the deeply valuable point is that they provide proof of principle that _ partner states in natural theories of the weak scale may take an entirely unexplored form_. in the case of the @xmath155 orbifold this is particularly clear : the quadratic sensitivity of the top loop to higher scales is cancelled by a loop of standard model - neutral top partners with twice the multiplicity and half the coupling - squared .",
    "there are a large number of possible future directions :    * so far we only constructed a rough sketch of some uv completions in terms of higher dimensional geometric orbifolds and it would certainly be worthwhile to map out the possibilities in a more systematic fashion . in this work we for simplicity restricted ourselves to flat extra dimensions , however warped constructions should be possible as well .",
    "in fact , while this paper was in preparation , a first example of a holographic uv completion of the twin higgs already appeared @xcite .",
    "+ a particularly intriguing property of the examples we constructed so far is the requirement of low scale gauge coupling unification to successfully embed the hypercharge group , and it would be interesting to elucidate this apparent connection further . of particular interest are also explicit geometric and deconstructed realizations of the non - abelian orbifolds .",
    "* our formalism is entirely transferable to supersymmetric theories , and a similar classification of orbifold supersymmetric models should be possible .",
    "the main difference in this case is the presence of an @xmath63-symmetry , which will participate in the orbifold projection .",
    "the simplest example of this mechanism is already known in the form of folded supersymmetry @xcite , but even more interesting possibilities include simultaneous orbifolds of the weak gauge group and an @xmath63-symmetry . in a different vein , it would be interesting to simply construct spontaneously broken supersymmetric uv completions of the orbifold higgs , along the lines of @xcite . *",
    "thus far we have restricted ourselves to the regular embeddings , however _ a priori _ there are many other representations to choose from . for arbitrary representations the necessary rescaling of the coupling constants is no longer guaranteed , however it is easy to verify that for certain sub - representations of the regular representation , the coupling constants do exhibit the correct scaling behavior .",
    "moreover these alternative representations are expected to give rise to more exotic quivers than the ones discussed in this paper .",
    "another direction would be to consider other geometric defects such as orientifolds that arise in string theory and possess field theory analogues .",
    "* perhaps the most important opportunity lays in mapping out the detailed phenomenology of this class of models across the experimental frontiers , from colliders to dark matter to low - energy probes .",
    "the prime hallmark of orbifold higgs models is a modification of the higgs couplings through mixing with the higgs(es ) in the dark sectors , as is the case for the twin higgs @xcite .",
    "+ further innovations include additional confining sectors connected through the higgs portal @xcite , as well as additional pseudo - goldstone states near the weak scale that couple to the standard model primarily through irrelevant operators .",
    "a ramification of uv completions of the orbifold higgs ( either in terms of extra dimensions or quiver gauge theories ) is that the higher kk - modes may be accessible , either directly at a future high energy collider , or indirectly as portal between the standard model and the dark sectors .",
    "+ the lhc phenomenology would be similar to that of a hidden valley @xcite through the higgs portal @xcite .",
    "note that explicit uv completions may also provide a handle via low - energy constraints not encountered at the level of the field theory orbifold .",
    "for example , in the models explored here the daughter states ( corresponding to the untwisted sector of some geometric completion ) introduce no flavor violation , while introducing heavier modes in the twisted sector may mediate flavor - violating processes at finite loop order .",
    "+ the final frontier awaiting exploration is that of dark matter . since the dark sector and the standard model share baryon number",
    ", the orbifold higgs may naturally harbor an asymmetric dark matter candidate @xcite in the form of the lightest dark baryon .",
    "interestingly , the dark sector in an orbifold higgs model is generically a factor of a few heavier than the standard model sector , such that these models may automatically generate the right dark matter / baryon ratio in the universe .",

    "correspondingly there are four irreps                              the mother theory is once again summarized by table ( [ tab : mothertheory ] ) , where now @xmath285 is fixed . from the general discussion of section [ sec : general - features ] , the pattern of symmetry breaking is                  su(n)_0 & : ( a^(0),i_0)_(0,a,0)^a , b=1,  ,n i_0=1,  ,n^2 - 1 + su(n)_1 & : ( a^(1),i_1)_(1,a,0)^a , b=1,  ,n i_1=1,  ,n^2 - 1 + su(n)_2 & : ( a^(2),i_2)_(2,a,0)^a , b=1,  ,n i_2=1,  ,n^2 - 1 + su(3n)_3 & : ( a^(3),i_3)_(3,a,)^a , b=1,  ,3n,=0,1,2 i_3=1,  ,9n^2 - 1                  turning to the matter fields , we employ once again formula ( [ eq : bifund - invt ] ) .",
    "for example , the transformation of @xmath119 under @xmath289 then reads @xmath290 , and all we need to do is examine the invariant fields case by case , i.e. for @xmath291 .                      as a partial check , we may employ the clebsch - gordan decomposition of @xmath273 irreps ( which can easily be worked out by standard representation theory , or found in the math literature ) : [ eq : cg - table - a4 ]          meaning that the orbifold preserves @xmath296 higgs components , in agreement with the above result .",

    "once again , the general discussion of section [ sec : scaling ] implies that yukawa , gauge , and quartic couplings in the mother theory generate corresponding interactions in the daughter theory , privately within each sector .",
    "this example features a nontrivial rescaling of the couplings , for the sector corresponding to the @xmath87-dimensional representation of @xmath273 .",
    "the quiver structure exhibits manifestly the @xmath88 symmetry of the daughter theory , which acts by permuting the @xmath166 sectors .",
    "note however that the approximate continuous symmetry protecting the higgs mass is now an su(24 ) rotating the @xmath299 surviving higgs components .",
