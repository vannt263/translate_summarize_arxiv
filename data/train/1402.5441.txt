    "were studied using various potential models  @xcite .",
    "now the technology of effective field theories ( efts ) has advanced to the point where we can address these issues using a systematic , qcd - symmetry based eft to complement the predictions of potential models .",
    "it is clear that the resolution of outstanding three - nucleon puzzles will require eft calculations to high precision .",
    "this paper is part of that effort .    for momenta below the threshold for producing dynamical pions ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "nuclear physics can be described by a lagrangian that consists solely of contact interactions between and among nucleon fields and external currents .",
    "this theory , pionless effective field theory ( @xmath5 ) , has a simple and manifest power counting  @xcite . in the two - nucleon sector",
    "@xmath5has been used successfully to calculate nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( @xmath6 ) scattering  @xcite , electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron  @xcite , and the neutron ",

    "deuteron ( @xmath7 ) scattering  @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath0 bound - state properties  @xcite , and parity - violation in @xmath2 interactions  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath1 scattering in @xmath5was originally investigated by rupak and kong  @xcite .",
    "they treated coulomb corrections perturbatively in @xmath9 , the fine structure constant , and developed a new power counting scheme in which the usual @xmath10 counting was supplemented with an additional scale @xmath11 , the external momentum .",
    "they were able to calculate quartet s - wave @xmath1 scattering to next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) when certain diagrams were partially resummed  @xcite and found reasonable agreement with phase shift data .",
    "however , their technique encountered numerical problems at center - of - mass ( c.m . ) momenta below 20 mev .",
    "further , their calculation was not strictly perturbative in the @xmath5power counting , but contained a subset of higher order terms .",
    "the work presented here builds upon that of knig and hammer  @xcite who , extending the previous work of rupak and kong , carried out calculations up to nnlo for both the quartet and doublet s - wave channels . using an optimized integration mesh they were able to obtain reasonable results down to a c.m . momentum of about 3 mev .",
    "however , again this calculation was not strictly perturbative in the @xmath5power counting .",
    "in addition , they assumed that up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the three - body forces from doublet s - wave @xmath2 scattering were sufficient to obtain cutoff - independent results for @xmath1 scattering .",
    "although their nlo phase shifts seem to have reasonable cutoff dependence , they did not go to large enough cutoffs to really test cutoff independence .",
    "indeed , we show here that at nlo , fixing a three - body force to only @xmath2 physics yields @xmath1 phase shifts and @xmath0 binding energies that do not converge for large cutoffs .",
    "the primary results of this paper are as follows : we show analytically and numerically that at leading order ( lo ) no new three - body forces are needed in @xmath1 scattering beyond those for @xmath2 scattering .",
    "however , we show that at nlo a new @xmath1 three - body force is required to obtain cutoff - independent results for @xmath1 scattering . without that force",
    "we see that for cutoffs much larger than 600 mev there is significant cutoff variation in the nlo @xmath1 phase shifts and nlo corrections to the @xmath0 binding energy . at nlo",
    "we fit this new three - body force to the @xmath0 binding energy and show that we then obtain cutoff - independent results for the nlo @xmath1 phase shifts .",
    "we also calculate an analytical form for this three - body force and demonstrate agreement with the numerically calculated values .-",
