    "the simple fact that nonorthogonal quantum states can not be perfectly distinguished lies at the basis of quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution ( qkd ) : an eavesdropper is not able to determine with 100% certainty which quantum state was sent if the alternatives were chosen from a nonorthogonal set of states . among the various strategies the eavesdropper might use to gather at least some information are measurements that maximize her probability of guessing the state correctly . alternatively , she might decide to perform a measurement that allows her with some nonzero probability to learn unambiguously which state was sent , at the cost of sometimes getting an inconclusive result .",
    "the concept underlying this type of measurements , unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) , was first introduced for the case of two nonorthogonal states by ivanovic in 1987 @xcite and a bound on the maxium achievable success probability was found shortly afterwards @xcite , @xmath2 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two states to be distinguished .    in general , a usd measurement with a nonzero probability to succeed exists for any number of states provided they are linearly independent @xcite .",
    "for the special case of sets of @xmath0 _ symmetric _ states , i.e. , states @xmath5 that can be written as @xmath6 for some fixed unitary operation @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , the optimum usd probabilities were found in @xcite .",
    "eavesdropping attacks using such usd measurements were analysed in @xcite and usd experiments on polarization were reported on in @xcite .",
    "here we will consider linear optics implementations of usd measurements on symmetric coherent states .",
    "in particular , we show that even without entangled measurements and quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements a usd measurement with near - optimum success probablity is possible using just beamsplitters , photodetectors and feedback .",
    "the motivation for this is as follows : in virtually all experimental implementations of the bb84 protocol @xcite the signal states are weak laser pulses ( see for instance @xcite ) rather than the single photons envisaged in the original protocol .",
    "one disadvantage is that an eavesdropper may exploit the presence of multiple photons in some of the signals to gain more information and/or remain undetected , as has been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "we show here how the legitimite users too can in fact make use of multiple photons by improving upon the standard measurement that is used in current implementations , which indeed is tailored for the single - photon implementation . if the quantum information is encoded in the phase of the signal a strong reference pulse is needed to provide a phase reference .",
    "the quantum states sent may then be assumed to be pure coherent states ( relative to the reference pulse , see @xcite ) with known amplitude @xmath9 ( assumed to be real ) but unknown phases that may take one of four possible values , @xmath10 . as pointed out in @xcite , if polarization is used instead of phase , the signal states are mixed states , not coherent states . yet , as detailed below , an important part of the following applies to both polarization and phase encoding .    in section",
    "[ rules ] we formulate the problem solved in this paper . in section [ results ]",
    "we discuss the solutions for usd of @xmath0 symmetric coherent states for @xmath11 and @xmath12 separately .",
    "the most detailed exposition is given for the case @xmath1 , the case that applies to qkd .",
    "suppose one has one copy of a coherent state @xmath13 with known amplitude @xmath9 but an unknown phase @xmath14 that may have one of @xmath0 values , @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the task is to unambiguously discriminate between these @xmath0 values .",
    "since the set of states @xmath17 is linearly independent there are in principle measurements possible that allow one to accomplish unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) with some nonzero probability . an optimum protocol and the corresponding maximum probabilities",
    "@xmath18 have been derived in @xcite : defining probability amplitudes @xmath19 for @xmath20 by @xmath21 @xmath18 is determined by the smallest of these amplitudes , according to @xmath22 the question considered here is what usd probability @xmath23 can one reach while using just beamsplitters , photodetectors , feedback and the ability to produce known coherent states of any amplitude ?    to be more precise , we allow the following operations and measurements :    1 .",
    "unitary operations : take two coherent states @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( that may be known or derived from the initial unkown state @xmath13 ) and split them on a beamsplitter to get two new coherent states as output modes , with amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in terms of the transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath28 of the beamsplitter .",
    "measurements : take a coherent output state and measure whether it contains photons or not , with a photodetector of efficiency @xmath29 .",
    "feedback : some of the light may be split off to a delay line so that subsequent measurements and unitary operations may depend on previous measurement outcomes .",
    "neither quantum - non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements nor entangled measurements are considered here , as those are far more difficult to perform with present - day technology .",
    "a primitive to be used later on is a simple beamsplitter setup that allows one with a finite probability to eliminate one particular value of the phase of a coherent state with known amplitude .",
    "take the state @xmath13 with unknown phase and combine it on a beamsplitter with the known coherent state @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 the phase we wish to eliminate . by taking",
    "the limit of @xmath33 and @xmath34 one will get ( besides a useless output that is discarded ) a coherent state @xmath35 .",
    "( note this corresponds to a displacement operation . )",
    "if a photon is detected in this state @xmath14 can not have the value @xmath32 .",
    "the probability of such a detection event is @xmath36 which depends on the actual ( unknown ) phase @xmath14 .",
    "we included here the quantum efficiency @xmath29 , defined as the probability of the photodetector to detect the presence of a photon .",
    "the effect of a finite efficiency is simply to effectively reduce the amplitude of the coherent state @xmath9 by a factor @xmath37 . in the following we present results for perfect photodetectors only and",
    "the results for imperfect photodetectors can be obtained by subsituting @xmath38 .",
    "this case is straightforward and known .",
    "it basically is a measurement in a particular `` basis '' specified by two phase values @xmath40 apart .",
    "take the state @xmath13 and put it on a 50/50 beamsplitter ( i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) with the state @xmath43 , such that the two output modes are coherent states with amplitudes @xmath44 , and measure photons on both outputs . since @xmath14 is either 0 or @xmath40 the probability to detect a photon is 0 in one output mode , and @xmath45 in the other .",
    "if a photon is detected one can eliminate one of the two possible values of @xmath14 , and thus the probability of usd with beamsplitters is @xmath46 which is in fact equal to the optimum value @xmath47 .",
    "alternatively one could use the phase elimination scheme from section  [ elim ] to find the same optimum value .",
    "in fact , applying that method allows one to perform an optimal usd on two coherent states with arbitrary phases @xmath32 and @xmath48 .",
    "namely , split the original unknown state in two equal parts @xmath49 and perform the two elimination measurements to eliminate @xmath32 or @xmath48 . the probability to eliminate",
    "one of the two is @xmath50 which is optimal and which reduces to ( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath51 .      in order to analyse the case",
    "@xmath52 we first consider a simple usd set - up with a reasonably high probability of success .",
    "first split the original unknown coherent state into 3 identical copies @xmath53 then use each of these three states in a phase elimination measurement setup of the type discussed in section  [ elim ] . with the help of ( [ p2 ] ) the probability to eliminate",
    "two out of three phases is @xmath54 since @xmath55 for all 3 possible pairs of different @xmath56 .",
    "this function is plotted in fig .  [ 3 ] .",
    "one can improve upon this simple strategy by splitting the state into many small - amplitude coherent states and trying to eliminate one of the phases first , and then use the optimal method to distinguish the remaining two possibilities .",
    "so , first make @xmath57 copies ( with @xmath58 ) of the state @xmath59 .",
    "then keep feeding copies in the three phase elimination setups until one of them gives a positive result . subsequently use the rest of the light to elinate the last phase .",
    "the probability of success is @xmath60 the first line gives the probability to produce a photodetection event after the @xmath61th try in one of the two photodetectors that possibly could click , the second line gives the probability of usd between the two remaining phases @xmath62 apart , with the light remaining at that point , with intensity @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath64 is plotted in fig .  [ 3 ] along with @xmath65 as a function of photon number @xmath66 .    for small amplitudes @xmath9 the minimum coefficient determining the optimum usd probability according to ( [ min ] ) is always @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath52 we get @xmath68 , and comparing this to @xmath69 shows our beamsplitter scheme is in fact optimal for small photon numbers , but the simple scheme only reaches @xmath70 .",
    "the case of @xmath1 symmetric coherent states is particularly relevant for qkd : as mentioned in the introduction the 4 signal states in standard implementations of the bb84 protocol @xcite using phase encoding are symmetric coherent states .",
    "because of its relevance we describe the measurement in more detail .    but",
    "first , we consider the simple scheme for the case @xmath1 consisting of splitting the coherent state into 4 equal parts @xmath71 and feeding these 4 states into 4 phase elimination setups .",
    "the probability to detect photons in 3 of those measurements is @xmath72 which is plotted in fig .  [ 4 ] .    the full measurement procedure that can be used in bb84 and that generalizes the near - optimum measurement from the preceding subsection , consists of 4 steps :    1 .",
    "split the original state into @xmath57 copies of the state @xmath59 .",
    "the optimum procedure requires taking the limit @xmath58 but any large value of @xmath57 will be sufficient in practice .",
    "choose randomly one of two `` bases '' ( as in section [ n=2 ] ) , either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , and perform phase measurements in the chosen basis on the subsequent copies until a photon is detected .",
    "the probability to detect a photon in exactly @xmath75 out of a possible @xmath57 tries is @xmath76 the total probability to succeed in finding a photon is @xmath77 this probability is larger than the probability for a photon to be found in the original signal state , simply because the measurement procedure itself doubles the number of photons on average .",
    "if one insists on using classical intuition , however , it is surprising that in half of the cases the receiver manages to measure the phase setting used by the sender no photons would have been found in the signal state .",
    "3 .   if a photon was detected in one basis in the previous step , then perform phase measurements in the other basis on the remaining copies until a photon is detected . if in the previous step exactly @xmath75 copies were used , the probability to detect a photon after exactly @xmath78 out of the remaining @xmath79 tries is @xmath80 the total probability to detect at least 2 photons in total ( one in this step , one in the previous ) is @xmath81 in the limit of @xmath82 this reduces to @xmath83 for small @xmath9 , @xmath84 , which is larger by a factor of 4 than the probability to find at least 2 photons in the original state for small @xmath9 . with 50% probability the _ classical _ bit values corresponding to the two outcomes obtained in this and the previous step will coincide . in that case",
    ", bob knows which _ classical _ bit alice sent without having to exchange basis information ( in this sense this is like the b92 protocol @xcite , and as such probably secure ) .",
    "if the two classical bit values obtained by bob are different , then only alice will have to reveal what basis she used for bob to know what state alice had sent .",
    "of course if in such a case the eavesdropper detected two photons as well , this would not be secure .",
    "however , the fact that bob detected 2 photons does not imply that eve detected two photons .",
    "if a photon was detected in the previous step , take the remainder of the light and feed equal amounts in two phase elimination setups corresponding to the two remaining phases .",
    "the probability to detect another photon , and thus to unambiguously determine the quantum state , is @xmath85 the total usd probability is then @xmath86 which in the limit @xmath82 simplifies to @xmath87 this function is plotted in fig .  [ 4 ] together with the optimum @xmath88 as a function of photon number @xmath66 . for small @xmath66 ,",
    "the more complicated scheme is optimal , @xmath89 , but the simple scheme only reaches @xmath90 .    to conclude this subsection , we consider the case where polarization is the degree of freedom used to encode information . as mentioned before ,",
    "the quantum states of the signals are mixed states .",
    "more precisely , the 4 signal states can be represented by density matrices of the form @xmath91 for @xmath92 and where the two modes correspond to two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "one could say the phase of the signal states is defined relative to a reference pulse of amplitude @xmath93 with the effective signal states having the same amplitude .",
    "the measurement procedure for phase encoding considered above requires for the first two photodetection events only reference pulses of the same amplitude as the signal .",
    "this part of the procedure thus carries directly over to the polarization case .",
    "it is only for the detection of the third photon , the part completing the usd measurement , that one needs to know the absolute phase of the signal states .",
    "this part , therefore , can not be used for the polarization case . instead , ref .",
    "@xcite gives an ingenious argument to derive the optimum usd measurement for this case : produce a state @xmath94 of a mode with polarization @xmath95 orthogonal to that of the unknown state ( call it @xmath96 ) .",
    "the combined state can be written as a coherent state with amplitude @xmath97 with an unknown polarization @xmath98 . then perform a non - demolition measurement of the photon number in that state and",
    "then perform the optimum usd measurement of polarization given the number of photons found .",
    "such a measurement only exists when one found 3 or more photons and the resulting probability of successful discrimination between the 4 phases is @xmath99 which is plotted in fig .",
    "since this measurement would require a quantum - non - demolition measurement of photon number and an unspecified optimum usd measurement of polarization on fock states it may not be implemented using just linear optics and photodetectors .",
    "it is easy to generalize the simple schemes of subsections [ n=3 ] and [ n=4 ] to @xmath12 .",
    "make @xmath0 copies of the state @xmath100 and test each of them for one of the phases @xmath15 .",
    "the probability to detect at least one photon in @xmath101 of those measurements is @xmath102 for small @xmath66 this expression reduces to @xcite @xmath103 the optimal usd probability scales as @xmath104 this shows that the simple scheme is far from optimal for large @xmath0 : for small amplitudes @xmath9 the ratio of the two probabilities scales as @xmath105 for large @xmath0 .    one straighforward generalization of the more complicated beamsplitter schemes of the previous subsections consists of first making @xmath57 copies of @xmath59 , then use @xmath0 phase elimination setups until one of those setups detects a photon after which the remaining @xmath101 phases are tested , etc . define @xmath106 to be the phase eliminated at the @xmath107th step . with the further definitions @xmath108 the probability to succeed in usd",
    "is then @xmath109 where the first summation is over all the @xmath110 different orders the phases @xmath111 can be eliminated .",
    "this expression is not easy to evaluate analytically , but for small @xmath112 we can expand in powers of @xmath112 and evaluate the lowest - order nontrivial term .",
    "starting from the last summation over @xmath113 and working backwards to the summation over @xmath114 we note that each summation gives rise to a factor @xmath115 at the @xmath116th step .",
    "the final summation then yields another factor @xmath117 and not forgetting the factor @xmath110 for the summation over all permutations of @xmath101 phases , finally leads to @xmath118 comparing this expression with ( [ scale ] ) we see that this is in fact optimal for small @xmath9 for any @xmath0 .",
    "we presented linear - optics implementations of unambiguous state discrimination measurements on @xmath0 symmetric coherent states , that is , coherent states with known amplitude @xmath9 but an unknown phase chosen from one of @xmath0 equidistant values in the interval @xmath119 .",
    "we discussed very simple but sub - optimal schemes for the cases of @xmath11 that can be very easily implemented , and we extended these to more complicated schemes requiring feedback that are optimal @xcite for small amplitude coherent states , the relevant limit for optical implementations of quantum cryptography .",
    "indeed , the set - up for @xmath1 can be fruitfully used by the receiving end in a bb84 @xcite quantum key distribution protocol with faint laser pulses .",
    "when polarization encodes the information only part of the protocol can be used , when phase encdoing is used the full procedure applies . if three photons in total are detected , the protocol is in fact a usd measurement , if only two photons are detected the receiver will know the bit sent by the sender in 50% of the cases without having to exchange any basis information . if only a single photon is detected , the measurement is equivalent to the standard one required in a single - photon implementation of the bb84 protocol .",
