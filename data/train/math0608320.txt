    "model reference adaptive control ( mrac ) architecture was developed conventionally to control linear systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the development of this architecture has been facilitated by the lyapunov stability theory that defines sufficient conditions for stable performance , but offers no means for characterizing the system s input / output performance during the transient phase .",
    "application of adaptive controllers was therefore largely restricted due to the fact that the system uncertainties during the transient have led to unpredictable / undesirebale situations , involving control signals of high - frequency or large amplitudes , large transient errors or slow convergence rate of tracking errors , to name a few .",
    "extensive tuning of adaptive gains and monte - carlo runs have been the primary methods up today enabling the transition of adaptive control solutions to real world applications .",
    "this argument has rendered verification and validation of adaptive controllers overly challenging .",
    "improvement of the transient performance of adaptive controllers has been addressed from various perspectives in numerous publications @xcite , to name a few .",
    "an example presented in @xcite demonstrated that the system output can have overly poor transient tracking behavior before ideal asymptotic convergence can take place . on the other hand , in @xcite the author proved that it may not be possible to optimize @xmath2 and @xmath3 performance simultaneously by using a constant adaptation rate . following these results , modifications of adaptive controllers",
    "were proposed in @xcite that render the tracking error arbitrarily small in terms of both mean - square and @xmath3 bounds .",
    "further , it was shown in @xcite that the modifications proposed in @xcite could be derived as a linear feedback of the tracking error , and the improved performance was obtained only due to a nonadaptive high - gain feedback in that scheme . in @xcite ,",
    "composite adaptive controller was proposed , which suggests a new adaptation law using both tracking error and prediction error that leads to less oscillatory behavior in the presence of high adaptation gains as compared to mrac . in @xcite , a high - gain switching mrac technique was introduced to achieve arbitrary good transient tracking performance under a relaxed set of assumptions as compared to mrac , and the results were shown to be of existence type only . in @xcite , multiple model and switching scheme is proposed to improve the transient performance of adaptive controllers . in @xcite , it is shown that arbitrarily close transient bound can be achieved by enforcing parameter - dependent persistent excitation condition . in @xcite , computable @xmath2 and @xmath3 bounds for the output tracking error signals",
    "are obtained for a special class of adaptive controllers using backstepping .",
    "the underlying linear nonadaptive controller possesses a parametric robustness property , however , for a large parametric uncertainty it requires high gain . in @xcite ,",
    "dynamic certainty equivalent controllers with unnormalized estimators were used for adaptation that permit to derive a uniform upper bound for the @xmath2 norm of the tracking error in terms of initial parameter estimation error . in the presence of sufficiently small initial conditions , the author proved that the @xmath3 norm of the tracking error is upper bounded by the @xmath3 norm of the reference input . in @xcite , differential game theoretic approach has been investigated for achieving arbitrarily close disturbance attenuation for tracking performance , albeit at the price of increased control effort . in @xcite ,",
    "a new certainty equivalence based adaptive controller is presented using backstepping based control law with a normalized adaptive law to achieve asymptotic stability and guarantee performance bounds comparable with the tuning functions scheme , without the use of higher order nonlinearities .    as compared to the linear systems theory ,",
    "several important aspects of the transient performance analysis seem to be missing in these papers .",
    "first , all the bounds in these papers are computed for tracking errors only , and not for control signals .",
    "although the latter can be deduced from the former , it is straightforward to verify that the ability to adjust the former may not extend to the latter in case of nonlinear control laws .",
    "second , since the purpose of adaptive control is to ensure stable performance in the presence of modeling uncertainties , one needs to ensure that the changes in reference input and unknown parameters due to possible faults or unexpected uncertainties do not lead to unacceptable transient deviations or oscillatory control signals , implying that a retuning of adaptive parameters is required .",
    "finally , one needs to ensure that whatever modifications or solutions are suggested for performance improvement of adaptive controllers , they are not achieved via high - gain feedback .",
    "following @xcite , subject to appropriate trajectory initialization , the following bound @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the tracking error , @xmath6 is the parametric error , @xmath7 is the positive definite lyapunov function , @xmath8 is the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath9 , found by solving the algebraic lyapunov equation associated with the error dynamics , implies that increasing the adaptation gain @xmath10 leads to smaller tracking error for all @xmath11 , including the transient phase .",
    "however , large adaptive gain leads to high frequencies in the control signal , implying that the improvement in the transient tracking of the system output is achieved at the price of unacceptable high frequencies in the system input .",
    "one can observe from the open - loop transfer function analysis for a pi controller ( which is a mrac - structure controller for a linear system with constant disturbance ) that increasing the adaptation gain leads to reduced phase - margin , and consequently reduced time - delay tolerance in input / output channels . on the contrary",
    ", decreasing the adaptive gain leads to large deviations from the desired trajectory during the transient phase .    in this paper",
    "we define a new type of model following adaptive controller that adapts fast leading to desired transient performance for the system s both input and output signals simultaneously .",
    "this new architecture has a low - pass filter in the feedback - loop that enables to enforce the desired transient performance by increasing the adaptation gain . for the proof of asymptotic stability , the @xmath0 gain of a cascaded system , comprised of this filter and the closed - loop desired transfer function ,",
    "is required to be less than the inverse of the upper bound on the norm of unknown parameters used in projection based adaptation laws . with the low - pass filter in the loop ,",
    "the @xmath0 adaptive controller is guaranteed to stay in the low - frequency range even in the presence of high adaptive gains and large reference inputs .",
    "the ideal ( non - adaptive ) version of this @xmath0 adaptive controller is used along with the main system dynamics to define a closed - loop reference system , which gives an opportunity to estimate performance bounds in terms of @xmath1 norms for system s both input and output signals as compared to the same signals of this reference system .",
    "these bounds immediately imply that the transient performance of the control signal in mrac can not be characterized",
    ". design guidelines for selection of the low - pass filter ensure that the closed - loop reference system approximates the desired system response , despite the fact that it depends upon the unknown parameter . thus , the desired tracking performance is achieved by systematic selection of the low - pass filter , which in its turn enables fast adaptation , as opposed to high - gain designs leading to increased control efforts . using a simple linear system with constant disturbance ,",
    "we demonstrate that this new architecture has guaranteed time - delay margin in the presence of large adaptive gain , as opposed to mrac .",
    "we further demonstrate the extension of the methodology to systems with unknown time - varying parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
