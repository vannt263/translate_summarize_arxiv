    "many important problems in galactic and extragalactic astronomy can only be constrained through the acquisition of extremely large databases of low- and/or medium - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "efficient multi - object spectrometers are now in routine operation , , wiyn s and ctio s hydra ( barden  1993 ) , aat s 2df ( gray  1993 ) , lick observatory s amos ( brodie & epps 1993 ) , wht s wyffos ( bingham  1994 ) , and the 6df on the uk schmidt telescope ( watson , parker , & miziarksi 1998 ) .",
    "spectrographs capable of obtaining several hundred spectra at a time are now reality , such as that used in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york  2000 ) , with others planned for installation at many telescopes in the near future .",
    "these instruments can rapidly assemble libraries of 10@xmath710@xmath8 spectra even during the course of a single night or single observing run ; new spectrographs with even greater multiplexing advantages are in various stages of development .",
    "although aimed at the study of galaxies and quasars , the on - going sdss will amass about @xmath9 stellar spectra with a resolving power of @xmath10 between 3900 and 9100   in a field around the north galactic pole .",
    "the combination of micro - arcsecond - accuracy astrometry with @xmath11 spectroscopy for @xmath12 stars that will be available in the future from gaia ( see perryman  2001 ) will revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics and the chemical evolution of the milky way and neighboring galaxies .",
    "the extraction of useful physical information from these large spectral databases ( for stars , parameters such as effective temperatures , surface gravities , metallicities , elemental abundance ratios , and radial velocities ) can of course be done one - star - at - a - time using well - understood analysis techniques  but this requires a small army of researchers .",
    "a much more sensible approach is to adapt and develop new techniques for automatic , accurate , and efficient extraction of key physical information from the spectra , ideally in real time .",
    "a number of previous authors have pursued the development of methods for obtaining estimates of atmospheric parameters from low- to medium - resolution stellar spectra .",
    "jones ( 1966 ) , for example , in early pioneering work , made visual estimates of ten line ratios and six line strengths for a uniform set of photographic coud spectra obtained with the palomar 200 \" telescope .",
    "he then performed a principal component analysis of these data , and calibrated the three largest principal components with temperature , luminosity , and metal abundance .",
    "thvenin & foy ( 1983 ) explored a technique based on the comparison of measured equivalent widths for several prominent spectral lines in @xmath13   resolution spectra with grids of theoretical equivalent widths obtained from model atmospheres .",
    "although their test sample of stars was rather small , the resulting derived errors were certainly respectable .",
    "cayrel  ( 1991 ) pursued similar ideas , making use of a matching algorithm that compared relatively high s / n ( 40 to 100 ) , low - resolution ( @xmath14   ) spectra with grids of synthetic spectra , and again achieved encouraging results based on a small number of comparison stars covering a wide range of atmospheric parameters .",
    "cuisinier  ( 1994 ) and gray , graham & hoyt ( 2001 ) described several techniques for the estimation of stellar parameters from medium - resolution spectra , based on comparisons with a grid of model atmospheres , but their application was mostly to more metal - rich stars of the galactic disk populations .    in this paper we examine the merits of a particular type of expert system based on back - propagation artificial neural networks ( hereafter anns ) for astrophysical parameter estimation from medium - resolution stellar spectroscopy .",
    "previously explored parameter - estimation techniques include cross - correlation and maximum - likelihood fitting ( katz  1998 ) and minimum vector - distance estimation ( kurtz 1984 ) .",
    "line - fitting techniques depend on prior knowledge of approximate spectral types before the determination of which lines to fit can be made , since different species can absorb at the same wavelengths in different ( , ) domains .",
    "cross - correlation , in its simplest form , also weights comparisons by line strength , although the strongest lines are not necessarily the features with the highest weight in classification assignment .",
    "cross - correlation also requires a well - populated library of homogeneous quality .",
    "minimum vector - distance techniques have had some success , but have not been pursued to the level desired for our purposes .",
    "it is important to note that these classical techniques are based on the application of _ linear _ operations . since we expect to find rather subtle _ non - linear _ relationships between temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity indicators in a given stellar spectrum , classification schemes that allow non - linear relationships between parameters , such as anns , should offer significant advantages .",
    "supervised anns have application to a wide variety of non - linear optimization problems .",
    "for the estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters , a growing body of work ( e.g. , gulati et al .",
    "1994 ; von hippel et al . 1994 ; vieira & ponz 1995 ; weaver & torres - dodgen 1995 , 1997 ; bailer - jones et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) has demonstrated that automated anns can be robust and precise classifiers of stellar spectra .",
    "recently , bailer - jones ( 2000 ) has explored the capability of ann techniques to deduce , , and [ fe / h ] for stars to be observed with the medium- and broad - band photometric systems to be implemented for the gaia space mission .",
    "rhee , beers , & irwin ( 1999 ) and rhee ( 2000 ) discussed the development and implementation of an ann approach for the analysis of digital scans of the hk - survey objective - prism plates , and found that , with the addition of rough color information from calibrated photographic surveys , they were able to select metal - deficient stars without the introduction of bias related to the temperature that plagued the original visual - selection technique .",
    "allende prieto  ( 2000 ) applied an ann approach to sets of prominent line indices in medium - resolution spectra from the hk survey , and demonstrated that reasonably accurate estimates of [ fe / h ] and broad - band color @xmath15 could be obtained in this way .",
    "we refer interested readers to these papers , and references therein , for both general information on anns and for specific mathematical details of their training and testing .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate the utility of the ann approach for the analysis of medium - resolution spectra of metal - poor stars of the galactic halo and thick - disk populations .",
    "most of the previous automated stellar spectral classification efforts have focused on local samples of stars with metallicities characteristic of the galactic disk .",
    "we note , however , that prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) have recently provided a large database of high- and low - resolution spectra ( including stars with metallicities as low as [ fe / h ] = 2.7 ) obtained with the elodie spectrograph on the ohp 1.5 m telescope , and are clearly in the process of further developing the tgmet spectral parameterization method of soubiran  ( 1998 ) and katz  ( 1998 ) .    in  2 the dataset for training and testing the anns is described , and in  3 the preparation of the database for ann input is outlined .",
    "the assignment of `` known '' atmospheric parameters for the stars in our sample is discussed in  4 . a detailed description of our adopted ann methodology , and the results of its application to stellar spectra ,",
    "are provided in  5 . in this same section",
    "we explore the impact of spectral s / n on the derivation of atmospheric parameters through a series of numerical experiments .",
    "our conclusions and suggestions for future work are provided in  6 . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the small number of deviant cases that were noted during the course of our analysis .",
    "the stars that form the basis of our evaluation of the ann approach were observed during medium - resolution spectroscopic campaigns by beers and collaborators for the metal - poor stars of the hk survey ( beers  1985 , 1992 ) . a discussion of the various campaigns is given in beers ( 1999 ) ; in table  1 we list the parameters of the spectra employed in the present study .",
    "to improve the homogeneity , we limited our sample to the best 6 telescope - detector combinations , from the 12 considered by beers  1999 .",
    "this filtering reduces the number of standards from the more than 500 studied by beers  to 279 stars .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the table list the telescope and detector used . column ( 3 ) lists the wavelength coverage of the spectra obtained .",
    "column ( 4 ) lists the dispersion of the spectra , in some cases after a re - binning was employed during the initial data reduction .",
    "column ( 5 ) lists the total number of spectra contributed to this study for each of the various combinations .",
    "the stars that comprise our study are a subset of the calibration stars used in the beers  medium - resolution surveys ( see beers  1999 ) .",
    "they were selected to cover the range of metallicities , temperatures , and surface gravities ( see  4 ) expected to pertain to the metal - poor stars discovered in the extensive hk survey .",
    "thus , these were the template stars used to judge the accuracy of the atmospheric parameters ( in particular the metallicity ) derived for candidate hk survey low - metallicity stars .",
    "hence , all our program stars have available estimates of [ fe / h ] .",
    "we employ the standard abundance notation that [ a / b ]  @xmath16  log@xmath17(n@xmath18/n@xmath19)@xmath20  ",
    "log@xmath21(n@xmath18/n@xmath19)@xmath22 , and equate metallicity to the stellar [ fe / h ] value from previous analyses of high - resolution spectroscopy by many workers .",
    "we have supplemented this information with newly derived estimates of  and  from several techniques , as described below .",
    "beers  ( 1999 ) describe a method for the estimation of stellar metallicity from medium - resolution ( @xmath23 12    ) spectroscopy and broad - band @xmath15 colors .",
    "this technique makes use of empirical corrections , based on standard stars of known abundance , to the predicted line strengths from synthetic spectra and estimated broad - band colors from model atmospheres .",
    "the final calibration obtained by beers  ( 1999 ) provides the means for accurate estimation of metallicity ( @xmath24([fe / h ] )  @xmath25 0.150.20  dex ) over the entire range of metallicities of known galactic stars ( 4.0  @xmath26  [ fe / h ]  @xmath26  + 0.3 ) .",
    "this represents a clear improvement over the beers  ( 1990 ) calibration , which had difficulty in obtaining metallicity estimates for stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath27 1.0 due to saturation of the k - line they used as their primary abundance indicator . however , there still are limitations to the beers  ( 1999 ) approach .",
    "for instance , the use of multiple levels of empirical corrections makes the approach somewhat cumbersome to implement for general use .",
    "this is one of the reasons we have begun to explore the use of anns for future work .",
    "although both the ann approach and the beers  method are capable of providing accurate metallicity estimates , we demonstrate below that the ann approach can obtain a similar level of accuracy using non flux - calibrated spectra _ without the need for additional broad - band photometric observations _ , and it is largely insensitive to reddening .",
    "furthermore , our ann technique is also capable of estimating temperatures and surface gravities , which the beers  calibration did not provide .",
    "the reduction and analysis of the spectroscopic data are described in beers  ( 1999 ) , and will not be repeated here . because this is our first attempt at developing a medium - resolution neural network for future use , we decided to impose a rather severe lower limit on the s / n ratios of the spectroscopic data that were used for the construction of our training and testing sets . in order to be used in our analysis , a stellar spectrum was required to have s / n  @xmath28  20 at 4000   , and cover at least the wavelength range 3850 to 4450   . as part of the selection process for program stars ,",
    "care was taken to make certain that any spurious features , such as cosmic ray hits , were removed from each spectrum prior to assembly of our data sets , since our ann uses the entire spectrum in its analysis . in the end ,",
    "spectra of 279 stars were chosen for the ann experiments described in this paper .",
    "several examples of the raw ( extracted and wavelength calibrated ) spectra , prior to their preparation for the anns , are shown in figure  [ fig - rawspectra ] .",
    "successful application of the ann techniques described below first requires the creation of a dataset that is as uniform as possible . for our purposes",
    "this means manipulating the spectra until : ( a ) they are all on the same stellar rest - wavelength scale , with identical starting and ending wavelengths ; ( b ) they have closely matched spectral resolutions ; and ( c ) their observed fluxes have been rectified in a consistent manner . the steps taken to transform the raw spectra into a form acceptable for ann analysis are described in this section .",
    "for all of these steps we employed various tasks contained within the iraf software package .",
    "first , the spectra were continuum flattened , effectively cancelling the combination of the stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the instrumental response . although the ( potentially useful ) stellar sed is therefore destroyed , it would not have been possible to recover this information for the majority of our stars due to the lack of available flux calibrations for most of the spectroscopic observations obtained during the hk survey campaigns .",
    "the most important part of this step was to treat the varied pseudo - continua of the raw spectra in a uniform manner .",
    "we were aided by the general weak - lined nature of our metal - poor program spectra , which allowed reasonable identification of regions that were relatively free of absorption features in wavelength domains from the red to as blue as 3900   . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "a conspiracy of increasing spectral line density , decreasing stellar flux , and decreasing instrumental efficiency generally resulted in low s / n and larger uncertainties in the placement of the pseudo - continuum level .",
    "we experimented extensively with different continuum rectification techniques , and eventually found that discarding the strongest absorption features and repeatedly applying a smoothing filter worked best for our spectra as a whole .",
    "this technique did not produce satisfactory results for the few very carbon - rich stars with strong bands of ch and c@xmath29 ( , cs  22957 - 027 : norris , ryan , & beers 1997 ; bonifacio  1998 ) for which continuum placement based on intermediate - resolution observations is difficult with any technique . as a result , the carbon - enhanced stars were not used in the present study .",
    "the continuum - flattened spectra were then shifted to a common radial velocity . since uniformity in the velocity frame is crucial , but the zero - point is not , all of our spectra were shifted in velocity to a single program - star template spectrum , using the iraf task _",
    "dopcor_. cross - correlations of all spectra with the template were done with the task _ fxcor_. the template spectrum was chosen to be that of hd  122563 ( f8iv ) , which contains features common to all of the spectra being prepared .",
    "the program stars in our study range from warm main - sequence dwarfs to cool red giants , and the stellar metallicities have a range of three orders of magnitude .",
    "we note that for future work on more extensive data sets , it may be best to use different velocity templates for different //[fe",
    "/ h ] domains , and carefully tie the templates to a common system . we found this additional step unnecessary for the initial exploration of anns considered here .    next , the spectra were re - binned to a common wavelength binning .",
    "we adopted a fixed binning of 0.65   / pix ( the dispersion of the template star , and the majority of our spectra ) , and used the iraf task _ dispcor _ to re - bin all of the program stars .",
    "the resolution is two to three times larger than the dispersion , depending on the data source and the particular observing conditions . with the same task",
    ", we trimmed the spectra to a common wavelength range , as our ann can perform only on data sets of identical wavelength coverage . using the iraf task _",
    "wspectext _ , we converted the spectra to a text format acceptable to the ann .",
    "finally , we multiplied the spectra by a constant factor to have an average value of 0.5 in a selected wavelength range , since our anns were developed to be most sensitive to flux values between 0 and 1 . in figure  [ fig - finalspectra ]",
    "we show the fully modified spectra , ready for ann input , of the same stars whose raw spectra appear in figure  [ fig - rawspectra ] .",
    "beers  ( 1999 ) compiled and averaged metallicities that had been determined from high - resolution spectroscopic analyses , based on flux - constant plane - parallel lte model atmospheres , for over 500 stars of the galactic halo and thick - disk populations .",
    "we selected our testing and training sets from that pool , taking particular care to achieve a reasonably complete distribution throughout the parameter space of , , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "although , in principle , an averaged set of  and  determinations from the high - resolution analyses could have been used in our application , we have chosen not to take this approach .",
    "the  and  employed in the high - resolution analyses come from a wide variety of sources ( broad- and/or narrow - band photometry , fits to isochrones , or fine analysis of the spectra themselves ) , hence a more homogeneous set of temperatures and surface gravities is desirable .",
    "this decision also permits a comparison of our derived parameters with independently obtained estimates from the high - resolution work .",
    "effective temperatures were derived from the @xmath30 colors , @xmath31 reddening corrections , and metallicities compiled by beers  ( 1999 ) . for dwarfs and subgiant stars",
    ", we applied the calibrations of alonso , arribas , & martnez - roger ( 1996 ) . for more evolved giant stars , we used the alonso , arribas , & martnez - roger ( 1999 ) calibrations .",
    "these calibrations are based on the infrared flux method ( irfm ) , developed by blackwell and collaborators ( see blackwell & lynas - gray 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "the irfm compares the observed ratio of the bolometric and monochromatic flux in the infrared with the ratio predicted by model atmosphere analyses .",
    "since the effective temperature defines the bolometric flux , the method only relies on the models to estimate the monochromatic flux in the infrared . from the use of several infrared photometric bands , it is possible to check for internal consistency , which turns out to be exceptionally good for  @xmath32  4500 k , resulting in mean errors of only 12% .",
    "the standard deviations of the polynomial fits to the irfm  as functions of @xmath15 color and metallicity are in the range 100170  k over the entire parameter space relevant to our program stars .    for their main - sequence ,",
    "subgiant , and giant stars , beers  ( 1999 ) derived absolute magnitudes and distances by making use of the revised yale isochrones ( green 1988 ; king , demarque , & green 1988 ) , over the metallicity interval 3.0  @xmath26  [ fe / h ]  @xmath26  0.0 , and assuming ages between 5 and 15  gyrs . to provide estimates for horizontal - branch stars and asymptotic giant - branch stars",
    ", they adopted a relation between @xmath33 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath34 ( see beers  for more details ) .",
    "we used their absolute magnitudes to interpolate in the oxygen - enhanced isochrones of bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) , and derived bolometric corrections and stellar masses .",
    "the calculated luminosities were then combined with the effective temperatures from the alonso   calibrations to obtain stellar radii , and then with the masses to derive estimates of the surface gravities .",
    "this procedure involved the adoption of an age to select the appropriate isochrone .",
    "the age was set at 15  gyr for the more metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath35  1.1 ) , at 4  gyr for those with [ fe / h ]  @xmath28  + 0.03 , and a linear variation between the extremes , fitting the trend found by edvardsson  ( 1993 ) .",
    "gravities can also be estimated by making use of the trigonometric parallaxes ( @xmath36 ) , in combination with the isochrones , as described in allende prieto  ( 1999 ) or allende prieto & lambert ( 1999 ) , although the relatively low accuracy of present parallax measurements limits the validity of the procedure to a small subset of our stars . in figure  [ fig - gravtest ]",
    "we illustrate the comparison between @xmath36-based and @xmath33-based gravity estimates for the stars analyzed by beers  ( 1999 ) with available _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( esa 1997 ) . the errors in the parallaxes dominate the discrepancies for stars farther away than 100  pc ( @xmath36  @xmath35  10  mas ) . for 115 ( generally metal - rich ) dwarfs closer to the sun than 100 pc , the mean difference between the @xmath36-based gravities and the @xmath33-based gravities is @xmath35@xmath37  ",
    "@xmath38  = 0.15 ( @xmath39  =  0.31 ) dex . the lack of nearby evolved stars in our sample precludes the application of the same test to them .",
    "the atmospheric parameters , , and [ fe / h ] adopted for each star in our study will hereafter be referred to as `` catalog '' ( cat ) values . in table",
    "2 the catalog values for the set of stars used to _ train _ the anns are listed as  @xmath40 ,  @xmath40 , and [ fe / h ] @xmath40 ; the parameters used to test the anns are listed under the same names in table  3 .",
    "note that column ( 2 ) of each table lists the source of the spectrum for each of our program stars , according to : e = eso 1.5 m ; k = kpno 2.1 m ; l = lco 2.5 m ; o = orm 2.5 m ; p = pal 5 m ; s = sso 2.3 m european southern observatory ( chile ) ; kpno @xmath16 kitt peak national observatory ( usa ) ; lco @xmath16 las campanas ( chile ) ; orm @xmath16 observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( spain ) ; pal @xmath16 mount palomar ( usa ) ; sso @xmath16 siding spring observatory ( australia ) ] .",
    "an asterisk next to the listed source indicates that the star is a member of the nearby subsample described below . a colon ( :) next to the catalog or network parameters indicates a large discrepancy ; see the appendix for discussion of individual cases .",
    "in this work we have employed a back - propagation ann code kindly made available by b.d .",
    "ripley ( see ripley 1993a , b ) . back - propagation is a standard ann training technique , though ripley has implemented a few clever additions that allow his code to operate without the free parameters of momentum and the learning coefficient .",
    "ann training is based on multi - dimensional minimization techniques that converge to the desired solution by iteratively providing the direction , but not the magnitude , of the updates necessary for the many weights connecting the ann nodes .",
    "a learning coefficient is commonly used to set the magnitude of the weight updates , whereas the momentum term sets the degree to which the weight updates in the current iteration are related to prior weight updates .",
    "careful tuning of the learning coefficient and the momentum term are necessary in standard back - propagation codes when the solution space has a number of local minima .",
    "the only remaining free parameters are the initial random weights interconnecting the various layers of the ann , and the criterion for stopping the learning process ",
    "more discussion of these is provided below .",
    "our network architectures were also standard and fully connected from the input layer to one , and sometimes a second , hidden layer and then to the output layer .",
    "the connections between nodes are numerical weights that contain the knowledge of the classification system .",
    "the training step involves adjusting the weights so that the anns provide a generalized mapping of the input space ( in our case , stellar spectra ) to the output space ( in our case , the estimated atmospheric parameters of , , or [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the number of nodes in the input layer was dictated by the number of spectral elements per spectrum .",
    "in other words , our anns ingest spectra , not derived parameters .",
    "the number of output nodes was always one .",
    "experimentation demonstrated that anns designed to ambitiously fit two or more desired parameters simultaneously ( here , , , and [ fe / h ] ) , converged on a robust solution far less frequently than those that specialized in a given parameter ,  , .",
    "thus , we built separate anns to determine each of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "decisions on the appropriate number of hidden nodes , and on whether to employ two layers of hidden nodes or just one , are dictated by the level of complexity and non - linearity in mapping the input space to the output space .",
    "we experimented with a wide range of numbers of hidden nodes in one layer ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , and 13 ) and in two layers ( 3:3 , 5:5 , and 7:7 ) .",
    "we chose odd numbers of hidden nodes in order to span a wider range of ann complexity without having to train as many anns .",
    "it is an important general rule of ann applications not to use too many hidden nodes , or the number of free parameters grows too large and the anns just memorize their training set rather then converge to the desired mapping .",
    "as explained in  2 , the spectra in our present application were obtained at a variety of observatories on a number of different spectrographs with a range of wavelength coverages .",
    "we wished to explore whether the heterogeneity in the data sources would limit the quality of the classifications . we thus chose to train anns on the entire training set ( hereafter , the total / full sample ) , as well as three additional subsamples .",
    "one subsample ( nearby / full ) was comprised of 101 stars with parallaxes larger than 10 mas , as measured by _",
    "hipparcos _ , and therefore with a fairly well constrained m@xmath41 ( see  4 ) .",
    "another subsample ( total / kpno ) consisted only of data obtained at the kpno 2.1 m telescope , since this was the most common source for our spectroscopy .",
    "the final subsample ( nearby / kpno ) was the intersection between the nearby and the kpno subsamples .",
    "for the kpno data the available wavelength range was 3733.9 to 4964.5   , corresponding to @xmath42 input parameters ; for the other two subsamples the available wavelength range was 3836.6 to 4452.9   , corresponding to @xmath43 input parameters",
    ". table  4 lists the number of stars contained in each subsample .",
    "below we point out that , in some instances , the additional information provided by the extended spectral coverage in the kpno spectra results in superior performance of the anns , which is perhaps no surprise .",
    "since our data sets were small , we used approximately 75% of the data , randomly drawn , to train the anns and the remaining 25% of the data to test the anns .",
    "standard practice is to divide the data set in half for training and testing , but other divisions are acceptable as long as the training and testing sets span the same regions of classification space .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - paramspace ] , our training and testing data essentially satisfy these criteria .",
    "a few spectra near the limits of the parameter domains will force the anns to extrapolate , but objects with the most extreme parameters will be difficult to classify by any automated technique .",
    "we found little difference between the results of most of the anns that we tried , indicating that this classification problem is well posed , has a broad global minimum ( optimal solution ) , and the data are appropriate for the task .",
    "rather than present the results for all anns that we built , we will concentrate on the architectures with one hidden layer and 9 hidden nodes for  and  and 13 hidden nodes for [ fe / h ] .",
    "these particular architectures yielded the best classifications . for comparison , the architectures which led to the worst classifications still provided adequate results , however , with errors larger by only 50 k ( ) , 0.04 dex ( ) , and 0.15 dex ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the input - to - output mapping function that is used in the nodes saturates when the total input to a given node ( the sum of the individual inputs multiplied by their weights ) , approaches @xmath44 , or becomes significantly greater than @xmath45 . for this reason the initial range of the weights connecting the nodes is from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , and the actual range of atmospheric parameters",
    "need to be remapped to values between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . given the ranges for our program stars in effective temperature ( 4000  k  @xmath48  @xmath48  6500  k ) , surface gravity ( 0.0  @xmath48  @xmath48  6.0 ) , and metallicity ( 4.0  @xmath48  [ fe / h ]  @xmath48  + 0.5 ) , we re - mapped these parameters with the following simple equations :    @xmath49 = (   4000 ) / 2500    ( @xmath50 = ( )  / 6    [ fe / h]@xmath49 = ( [ fe / h ]  0.5 ) / 4.5 .",
    "we arbitrarily set the maximum number of learning iterations to 1000 , stopping the ann training at that point .",
    "since the major portion of the error minimization occurs in the first few dozen iterations , followed by an exponential decrease in the rate of learning , by the time the networks had trained to 1000 iterations the learning rate was essentially zero . although the training of a given ann architecture with 1000 iterations took only 30 minutes on a _ sun ultra 30 _ workstation , the exploration of a range of architectures ( and details of the data set ) required weeks of computer time .",
    "note , however , that classifying data with a trained ann is much faster than training the ann ; an individual classification requires less than one second of cpu time .",
    "we explored ten different initial random - weight configurations for each of the final anns we chose to apply . by training the same architecture with different initial random weights we obtained a measure of how likely the anns were to converge on local minima rather than the desired global minimum .",
    "the anns were the easiest to train , and converged on spurious local minima in only one out of ten instances .",
    "the  problem was more challenging , especially when training on the smaller nearby sample .",
    "for this parameter the anns converged on local minima in seven out of ten instances . since cross - validation , _",
    "i.e. _ testing with the unseen data set , makes it readily apparent when the anns converge on local minima , it is easy to retain and apply only the well - trained anns .",
    "the difficulty that our anns experienced when training on the small data sets indicates that we are approaching the lower limit on the appropriate number of spectra for the training step .",

    "note that , in general , the scale estimates obtained for the nearby / kpno subsample are often somewhat smaller than those for the total / full subsample .",
    "we expect this result due to the more homogeneous nature and larger spectral coverage of the kpno data , relative to the full data .",
    "furthermore , the spectra of the nearby stars typically have higher s / n than those included in the total / full subsample and , in the case of the  results , it should be kept in mind that the trigonometric gravities for the nearby stars are more accurate than those obtained for the more distant stars included in the total / full subsample .",

    "katz  ( 1998 ) have pursued a study of a least - squares matching technique , based on the comparison of high - resolution stellar spectra to a grid of stars with known atmospheric parameters , and obtained _ internal _ errors of estimation of @xmath68 k , @xmath69 dex , and @xmath5 } ) \\sim 0.17 $ ] dex , respectively , for stellar spectra with s / n ratios in the range 10 to 100 .",
    "these errors are completely in line with our own internal errors , suggesting that , when applying the ann technique , one is not forced to employ high - resolution spectroscopy , at least for accurate determination of these stellar parameters .      the scatter of points seen in figure  [ fig - tgfres ] is dominated by a small number of stars with large mismatches between input catalog parameters and output network predictions .",
    "blame for these clashes must be assessed on a case - by - case basis , and is provided in appendix a. included in that list are stars with @xmath70ann - cat@xmath70 parameter deviations in excess of 350  k in , 0.6 dex in , and 0.3 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "below we discuss some factors that may be responsible when good points go bad .",
    "the reader is cautioned again that the anns of this study , in common with all automated pattern recognition algorithms , are far better _ interpolators _ than _ extrapolators_. our anns have trouble in those areas of the ( , , [ fe / h ] ) parameter space where the training spectra are few or absent . for example , from inspection of the middle panel of figure  [ fig - paramspace ] one expects difficulties for stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath48 3 , especially over the temperature regime 5000  @xmath35  @xmath35  6000  k , where we have no training or test spectra .",
    "five of the deviant stars discussed in appendix a have extremely low metallicities , and their spectra at moderate resolution have very few strong atomic features .",
    "the anns undoubtedly are losing some parameter sensitivity in this metallicity regime , a limitation that should be easily overcome by training on larger samples of lower metallicity stars .",
    "subgiants , those stars in the parameter space defined roughly by 5100  @xmath35  @xmath35  5600  k and 3.2  @xmath35  @xmath35  3.8 ( figure  [ fig - paramspace ] , top panel ) , are apparently not well represented among our program stars . however , this gap may be , at least in part , tied to our adopted methods of setting catalog parameters for the program stars .",
    "one virtue of the approach outlined in  4 lies in its uniformity  every star is treated as identically as possible . but",
    "this demands that some more - or - less arbitrary choices be made .",
    "for example , the adopted temperature scale is that of alonso  ( 1996 , 1999 ) , which is based upon application of the irfm .",
    "the irfm has very few input assumptions , but does rely on model atmospheres to predict monochromatic ir fluxes . on the other hand ,",
    "the adopted gravities are derived from the absolute magnitudes of beers  ( 1999 ) , based on a visual spectral classification .",
    "consider as one example the well - studied subgiant hd  140283 .",
    "our application of the alonso temperature calibration yields  @xmath40  = 5792 k , but a glimpse at several recent high - resolution analyses shows a wide range of values : 5640 k ( magain 1989 @xmath16 m89 ) , 5750 k ( ryan , norris , & beers 1996 @xmath16 rnb96 ) , 5755 - 5779 ( gratton , carretta , & castelli 1996 @xmath16 gcc96 ) , and 5843 k ( fuhrmann et al .",
    "1997 @xmath16 fpfrg97 ) .",
    "this particular case exemplifies a general tendency : the temperature scales from the irfm advocated by alonso  are neither among the highest nor the lowest scales in the literature .",
    "we assigned  @xmath71 to this star , close to the highest values among the high - dispersion studies : 3.10 ( m89 ) , 3.40 ( rnb6 ) , 3.60 - 3.80 ( gcc96 ) , and 3.20 ( fpfrg97 ) .",
    "however , allende prieto et al . ( 1999 ) derived @xmath72 3.80 from the measured _ hipparcos _ parallax .",
    "finally , [ fe / h]@xmath73 , which falls in the middle of the range spanned by the high - dispersion analyses : @xmath74 ( m89 ) , @xmath75 ( rnr96 ) , @xmath76 to @xmath77 ( gcc96 ) , and @xmath78 ( fpfrg97 ) .",
    "we want to emphasize that considerable care is required in the examination of the temperature , gravity , and metallicity scales adopted in this and in other studies .",
    "the same warning applies to individual cases of deviations between input catalog and output ann parameters , as not all of our program stars have been treated with equal vigor in past studies .",
    "indeed , a few of our program stars have not yet had the benefit of high - resolution spectroscopic analysis over wide wavelength ranges",
    ". the anns constructed here may fail for particular stars , but often they also bring to light stars that deserve further study .      if anns are to be successfully employed in the analysis of extremely large spectroscopic data sets ( which we anticipate will become available in the near future ) , they will need to work reliably on spectra with both high s / n , like the spectra employed here , as well as with spectra of much lower s / n .",
    "our data are not ideally suited to explore the effects of variable s / n values on anns , but we have attempted a few experiments that may point the way toward more comprehensive efforts in the future .    from our original sample of program stars we randomly selected a subset of 52 stars having s / n  @xmath25  50 near 4000   , and artificially degraded their s / n at this wavelength to @xmath25  26 and then to @xmath25  13 .",
    "the strong wavelength dependence of the s / n in the original spectra was preserved using the square root of the raw ( unflattened ) spectra to scale the extra poissonian noise introduced . in figure  [ fig - noisyspectra ]",
    "we display one example of the s / n degradation procedure .",
    "the pernicious effect of low s / n is clearly seen in this figure , as some prominent features ( , the ch g - band near 4300   , or at 4045   ) in the original spectrum shown in the top panel become nearly undetectable in the low s / n spectrum shown in the bottom panel .    as a first experiment , we submitted these sets of spectra with different noise levels as new data into the final anns that we had trained as described above . in this manner , we sought to ascertain whether or not the anns built to recognize differences in high s / n spectra could produce reasonable estimates of the atmospheric parameters for stars with lower s / n spectra .    in table  5",
    "we summarize the statistics of the ann classifications of these data sets , organized in a similar manner to table  4 above . figure",
    "[ fig - stgfres0 ] is a graphical summary of the distribution of residuals for this experiment .",
    "inspection of the table and figure reveal several features of note . as expected",
    ", there is a clear general trend toward increasing the zero point error ( @xmath52 ) and in the scatter ( @xmath53 ) for both the internal and external subsamples as one progresses to lower s / n ratios .",
    "the  classification is the least affected , with the changes in location and scale of the residuals staying almost constant as one progresses from high to low s / n ratios .",
    "the classification suffers rapid degradation with declining s / n , and exhibits a systematic shift in the zero point from near @xmath79 dex to on the order of @xmath80 to @xmath81 dex , and roughly a tripling of the scatter .",
    "similarly , the [ fe / h ] classification indicates a zero - point shift and increase in scatter with declining s /",
    "n .    the systematic errors in [ fe / h ] are puzzling , and opposite those seen in the auto - correlation function approach described by beers et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where decreasing s / n leads to a positive systematic error in the metallicity scale .",
    "furthermore , there also exists a trend in metallicity at a _ fixed _ s / n ratio , in the sense that metal - rich stars have their abundances more underestimated than the metal - deficient stars . at present",
    ", we can not explain these systematic trends in  or [ fe / h ] classification with decreasing s / n , and we leave this to future investigation .    as a final experiment",
    ", we constructed _ new _ anns , trained on input spectra having similar s / n ratios to the spectra we test them with , s / n @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "table  5 and figure  [ fig - stgfres ] show the results .",
    "it is immediately clear that the zero - point shifts previously encountered have now disappeared . of even greater interest ,",
    "the scatter obtained in the estimates of the internal and external errors are essentially identical for spectra of declining s / n ratios , and are roughly equivalent to those obtained previously when using anns trained and tested with only high s / n spectra , as can be noted by comparison of figure  [ fig - stgfres0 ] with figure  [ fig - tgfres ] .",
    "we conclude that it is better to classify spectra of a given s / n with anns trained on spectra of similar s / n than with anns trained exclusively on higher s / n spectra .",
    "this result suggests two future approaches .",
    "one should either train anns on spectra with a variety of s / n ratios ( and much larger training sets ) , or train anns for specific s / n ratios , and carry out an interpolation between the derived results for the observed s / n of the spectrum .",
    "we have explored the use of artificial neural networks for three - dimensional classification of medium - resolution stellar spectra .",
    "we have constructed , trained , and tested anns specific to the individual estimation of the , , and [ fe / h ] , and find that these parameter - specific networks are superior to the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters from an omnibus ann .",

    "further experimentation is necessary to identify the limiting s / n ratio for which useful parameter estimation is still possible ; already , we find reasonably accurate estimates can be obtained with spectra of s / n as low as 13 .    in the near future",
    ", we anticipate the construction of trained anns , covering a variety of s / n ratios and spectral resolutions , with which stellar spectra exhibiting a wide range of atmospheric parameters can be usefully analyzed .",
    "the recent study by gray , graham & hoyt ( 2001 ) , which makes use of stellar spectra very similar to those employed here , has revealed that micro - turbulence has to be taken into account as an independent parameter in order to recover properly the surface gravity .",
    "a second addition that will improve the results is to decouple the abundances of the alpha elements from the rest of the metals , modeling it as a new variable .",
    "so far , the simple tests carried out in this paper encourage the use and refinement of anns for on - going and soon - to - be - undertaken large - scale surveys of stellar spectra , both from ground - based and space - based observatories .",
