    "surface diffusion is of interest not only because it is so different from diffusion in bulk solids @xcite but because diffusion of adatoms on metal surfaces , individually or as a group via multi - atom or concerted diffusion processes plays an essential role in a wide variety of such surface phenomena as heterogenous catalysis , epitaxial crystal growth , surface reconstruction , phase transitions , segregation , and sintering.@xcite a precise knowledge of diffusion mechanisms is essential for understanding and control of these phenomena.@xcite adatoms can diffuse on a substrate in a variety of ways , and competition between various types of diffusion processes ( due to the differences in their rates ) determines the shapes of the islands formed and ( on macroscopic times scales ) , the morphological evolution of thin films .",
    "hence a great deal of effort has been devoted to investigation of self - diffusion of adatom islands on metal surfaces , initially using field ion microscopy ( fim),@xcite and more recently scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite because of inherent differences in the microscopic processes responsible for island diffusion on different metal surfaces , this is still an on - going research problem .",
    "both experimental and theoretical studies for various systems have succeeded in finding the activation barriers and prefactors for a single - adatom diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "ref   provides a good survey of those efforts . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , there has so far been no systematic experimental or theoretical effort to identify the diffusion mechanisms responsible for diffusion of small 2d ni islands on ni(111 ) and to calculate their activation barriers . in this article",
    "we report our results of doing so for such islands , ranging in size from 1 to 10 atoms .",
    "arrangement of atoms in the substrate of an fcc(111 ) surface results in two types of three - fold hollow sites for an adatom : the regular fcc site ( with no atom beneath it in the second layer ) , and an hcp site ( with an atom beneath it in the second layer ) .",
    "occupancy of adatoms at fcc sites maintains the crystal stacking order ( abc stacking ) of fcc structure , while occupancy of hcp sites leads to a stacking fault .",
    "depending on its relative occupation energy , which is material dependent , an adatom can occupy one or the other of these sites .",
    "which site is preferred on the fcc(111 ) surface affects the way diffusion and hence growth proceeds .",
    "it is therefore important to understand whether the diffusion proceeds via movement of atoms from fcc - to - fcc or hcp - to - hcp or fcc - to - hcp hcp - to - fcc sites .",
    "it has been observed experimetally that for smaller clusters mixed occupancy @xcite of fcc & hcp sites is possible .",
    "a host of studies has been devoted to problems of self - diffusion and diffusion mechanisms on metal fcc(111 ) surfaces , almost exclusively , however , with either a preconceived set of processes or merely approximate activation barriers .",
    "it is nevertheless crucial to discover the full range of processes at work and to accurately establish the activation barrier of each .",
    "it is also well known that the fcc(111 ) surface , being atomically flat , has the least corrugated potential energy surface of any fcc surface , resulting in low diffusion barriers even for clusters to diffuse as a whole .",
    "consequently , studies of diffusion processes on fcc(111 ) surfaces is a challenging problem for both experiment and simulation even to this day . for a monomer and smaller islands like dimer , trimer and up to certain extent , tetramer ,",
    "all possible diffusion processes may be guessed .",
    "but as islands further increase in size , it becomes more difficult to enumerate all possible diffusion processes _ a priori_. an alternative is to resort to molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation .",
    "but because diffusion processes are rare events , an md simulation can not capture every microscopic process possible , as most of the computational time is spent in simulating atomic vibration of atoms .",
    "instead , to do a systematic study of small ni island diffusion on ni ( 111 ) surface we resorted to an on - lattice self - learning kinetic monte carlo ( slkmc - ii ) method , which enables us to study longer time - scales than are feasible with md yet to find all the relevant atomic processes and their activation barriers on - the - fly , as kmc methods limited to _ a priori _ set of processes can not do . moreover , whereas previous studies have used an on - lattice slkmc method , @xcite in which adatoms were restricted to fcc occupancy , in the present study both fcc and hcp occupancies are allowed , and are detectible by our recently developed improved pattern - recognition scheme@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sim_details ]",
    "we discuss the details of our slkmc - ii simulations , with particular attention to the way we find diffusion processes and calculate their activation barriers . in section  [ results ] we present details of concerted , important multi - atom and single - atom diffusion processes responsible for the diffusion of ni islands as a function of island size . in section  [ dcoefficients ] we present a quantitative analysis of diffusion coefficients at various temperatures and of effective energy barriers as a function of island size . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "to study ni island diffusion on fcc ni(111 ) surface , we carried out slkmc simulations using the pattern - recognition scheme we developed recently @xcite that includes both fcc and hcp sites in the identification of an atom s neighborhood .",
    "various types of diffusion processes are possible , and their activation barrier depends on the atom s local neighborhood . whenever a new neighborhood around an atom is identified , a saddle - point search is carried out to find all the possible atomic processes and calculate their activation barriers  provided that it has at least one similar empty site in the second ring@xcite , since when an atom occupies an fcc ( or alternatively an hcp ) site , the nearest neighbor ( nn ) hcp ( or , correspondingly , fcc ) sites can not be occupied . in our simulations",
    "we used a system size of 16x16x5 with the bottom 2 layers fixed , and carried out saddle - point searches using the drag method . in this method a central or active atom is dragged in small steps towards a probable final position . if the central atom is on an fcc ( hcp ) site , then it is dragged towards a nn vacant fcc ( hcp ) site in the second ring .",
    "since atoms are allowed to occupy either hcp or fcc sites , an atom being dragged from an fcc ( hcp ) site to a neighboring similar site is allowed to relax to an intermediate hcp ( fcc ) site in between the two fcc ( hcp ) sites . in other words , processes are possible in which atoms in an island may occupy fcc , hcp or both fcc & hcp sites simultaneously . in the drag method , the atom being dragged is always constrained in the direction of the reaction coordinate but allowed to relax along its other degrees of freedom ( those perpendicular to the reaction coordinate ) , while all the other atoms in the system are allowed to relax in all degrees of freedom .",
    "once the transition state is found , the entire system is completely relaxed to find the final state of the process .",
    "the activation barrier of the process is the difference between the energies of the transition and initial states .",
    "we have verified the activation barriers of some of the key processes found by the drag method using the ( more accurate but computationaly expensive ) nudged - elastic band ( neb ) method@xcite , and found no significant difference . for inter - atomic interactions",
    ", we used an interaction potential based on the embedded - atom method ( eam ) as developed by foiles _",
    "et al_.@xcite . in all our slkmc simulations we used the same pre - exponential factor of @xmath1s@xmath2 , which has been demonstrated to be a good assumption for such systems as the one under examination here.@xcite    for the small islands under study here ( 1 - 10 atoms )",
    ", we found that when an atom is dragged rest of the atoms in the island usually follow .",
    "for very small islands ( 1 - 4 atoms ) , @xmath3 of the processes identified by the drag method were concerted - diffusion processes .",
    "as island size increases we found single - atom and multi - atom processes as well . for islands of size 5 - 6 , even single - atom detachment processes are identified and stored in the database ( even though they are not allowed in our simulations ) . to account for all types of processes associated with both compact and non - compact shapes  especially concerted processes and multi - atom processes ",
    "we used @xmath0 rings to identify the neighborhood around an active atom in our slkmc simulations . using @xmath0 rings",
    "corresponds to including fifth nearest - neighbor interactions . to make sure we identified all the single - atom processes",
    ", we also carried out saddle - point searches with all of the atoms fixed except the atom being dragged .",
    "although there is no infallible method for discovering all possible processes , we did exhaust the search for possible processes identifiable using the drag method .    in order to save computational time",
    ", we first carried out slkmc simulations at 700k for each island size , and used the database thus generated to carry out our simulations for the same size at lower tempratures ( 300 , 400 , 500 and 600k ) .",
    "the rationale for this approach is that an island goes through many more shapes at higher tempratures : when a simulation is carried out at a lower temprature starting out with a database generated at a higher temprature , it only rarely finds an unknown configuration .",
    "it is not possible , however , to economize on computational time by using , for the smaller islands under study here , a database generated for ( say ) the larger among them , because the types of processes possible ( along with their respective barriers ) are dependent on an island s particular size .",
    "as mentioned above , all of the processes for a given island are identified and their activation barriers calculated , and stored in a database on - the - fly .",
    "we discuss in this section , however , only key processes of the various general types ( concerted , multi - atom and single - atom ) .    fig .  [ monomer](a ) is a sketch of the fcc(111 ) surface with its adsorption sites marked as fcc and hcp . determining whether an adatom is on an fcc or on an hcp site on this surface requires knowledge of at least @xmath4 substrate layers below the adatom layer . in all our figures",
    "we show only the adatom layer and the layer below ( the top substrate layer ) with the convention that the center of an upward - pointing triangle ( along the y - axis ) formed by the ( top layer ) substrate atoms is an fcc site , while the center of a downward - pointing triangle pointing triangle is an hcp site .",
    "an island on an fcc ( 111 ) surface can be on fcc sites or on hcp sites or a combination of both sites ( some atoms of the island sitting on fcc sites and the rest on hcp sites ) . depending on the type of material either the fcc or the hcp site will be energetically favorable . as we shall see for each island size under study here , the fcc site for ni(111 ) is always at least slightly more favorable than the hcp site .    a compact adatom island on an fcc(111 )",
    "surface can move in the three directions shown in fig.[monomer](a ) .",
    "note that the numbering scheme for the directions open to an atom on an fcc site is inverse to that for those open to an atom on an hcp site ( see fig .",
    "[ monomer](a ) ) .",
    "we follow the enumeration convention for directions distinguished in fig .",
    "[ monomer](a ) throughout the article in tabulating activation barriers for concerted processes for islands of various sizes and shapes .",
    "concerted processes involve all atoms moving together from all - fcc sites to all - hcp sites or vice - versa . in a concerted diffusion process",
    "a cluster can either translate in one of the three directions shown in fig .",
    "[ monomer ] ( concerted translation ) or rotate around an axis ( around the center of mass ) , either clockwise or anti - clockwise ( concerted rotation ) .",
    "since concerted rotational processes do not produce any displacement in the center of mass of an island , they do not contribute to island diffusion .",
    "depending on the size of the island and its shape , activation barriers for the processes in these three directions can be different .",
    "activation barriers for single - atom processes , however , depend on the type of step - edge along which atom diffuses . fig .  [ monomer](b ) shows , using the example of a 6-atom hcp island , how an a - type step - edge @xmath5 a ( 100 ) micro - step differs from a b - type step - edge @xmath5 a ( 111 ) micro - step .",
    "we discuss important single - atom diffusion processes systematically and in detail in sub - section  [ single ] .    as island size increases not only",
    "does the frequency of single - atom processes increase but the frequency of multi - atom processes does so as well .",
    "all multi - atom mechanisms involve shearing .",
    "a special case is reptation mechanism@xcite , a two - step shearing process that moves the cluster from all - fcc to all - hcp sites or the reverse : first , part of the island moves from fcc to hcp sites ; then the rest of the island moves from fcc to hcp .",
    "hence at the intermediate stage , the island has mixed fcc - hcp occupancy . in case of ni - island diffusion ,",
    "reptation processes occur only when the shape of the island becomes non - compact .",
    "we will discuss reptation in detail when we take up islands of size 8 - 10 .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "much work has been done to determine activation barrier for ni monomer diffusion on ni ( 111 ) surface@xcite . a monomer on fcc ( 111 )",
    "surface can adsorb either on an fcc or an hcp site .",
    "we find that adsorption of an adatom on an fcc site is slightly favored over than on an hcp site by @xmath6 ev  in good agreement with the value reported in ref  .",
    "diffusion of a monomer occurs through hopping between fcc sites via an intermediate hcp site .",
    "we find the activation barrier for a monomer s hopping from an fcc site to a neighboring hcp site to be @xmath7 ev while that for the reverse process is @xmath8 ev .",
    "the effective energy barrier for monomer is found to be 0.057 ev , which is consistent with the result reported by liu _",
    "et al_.@xcite of @xmath9 ev .      on any fcc(111 )",
    "surface a dimer ( of the same species ) can have three possible arrangements : both atoms on fcc sites ( an ff - dimer , fig .",
    "[ dimer](b ) ) , both on hcp sites ( an hh - dimer , fig .",
    "[ dimer](a ) ) or one atom on an fcc and the other on an hcp site ( an fh - dimer , fig .",
    "[ dimer](c ) ) .",
    "we find that the ff - dimer is energetically more favorable than the hh - dimer by @xmath10ev and the fh - dimer the least favorable by @xmath11 ev .",
    "we find that both ff and hh dimers diffuse via concerted as well as single - atom processes , whereas the fh - dimer diffuses via single - atom processes only .",
    ".[tdimer]activation barriers ( in ev ) of concerted processes for dimer diffusion .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to summarize : we have performed a systematic study of the diffusion of small ni islands ( 1 - 10 atoms ) on ni(111 ) , using a self - learning kmc method with a newly - developed pattern recognition scheme ( slkmc - ii ) in which the system is allowed to evolve through mechanisms of its choice on the basis of a self - generated database of single - atom , multiple - atom and concerted diffusion processes ( each with its particular activation barrier ) involving fcc - fcc , fcc - hcp and hcp - hcp jumps .",
    "we find that concerted diffusion processes contribute the most to the displacement of the center of mass ( i.e. , to island diffusion ) , while single - atom processes contribute the least . as for multi - atom processes ( reptation or shearing ) : while these produce more displacement than the latter , they are hardly ever selected .",
    "though the energy barriers for reptation processes are small compared to those for concerted diffusion processes , reptation occurs only when an island is transformed into a non - compact shape , as happens only rarely in the temprature range to which our study is confined .",
    "in contrast , though shearing occurs with close - to - compact shapes ( which appear more frequently than do non - compact shapes , but with islands of certain sizes ) , the barriers for these processes are higher than those for reptation . finally , although for all island sizes , island diffusion is primarily dominated by concerted diffusion processes , the frequency of occurrence of both single - atom and multi - atom processes does increase with increase in island size , owing to increase in the activation barrier for concerted diffusion processes with island size .",
    "[ database ] shows the number of each type of diffusion process ( single- , multi - atom and concerted ) collected during our slkmc - ii simulations for each island size ( 1 - 10 ) , together with the total number of processes of all types for each island size .",
    "( for the sake of clarity , the insert shows a log - linear plot of these quantities for island sizes 1 - 6 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the number of processes accumulated increases with island size , and significantly so beyond the tetramer .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ database ] that the overall increase in number of processes with island size is constituted predominantly by significant increases in single - atom processes and ( to a lesser degree ) multi - atom processes .",
    "meanwhile the number of concerted processes accumulated in the database increases at a much slower pace with island size .",
    "this significant increase in single - atom processes is mainly due to the use of @xmath0 rings to identify the neighborhood of an atom .",
    "use of @xmath0 rings corresponds to inclusion of @xmath12 nearest - neighbor fcc - fcc or hcp - hcp interactions .",
    "elsewhere we show that @xmath13 rings ( which corresponds to @xmath14 nearest - neighbor interactions ) offer a range of interaction sufficient for accurately calculating the activation barriers for single - atom processes.@xcite but it is essential to include the long - range interaction ( and hence 10 rings ) if one aims to accurately take into account multi - atom and concerted processes , the latter of which predominate in small - island diffusion .",
    "this significant increase in the number of processes with island size also justifies resorting to an automatic way of finding all the possible processes during simulations instead of using a fixed ( and thus necessarily preconceived ) list of events .    as mentioned earlier , with increasing island size",
    "not only does the number of accumulated single - atom processes and multi - atom processes increase but also their frequency of occurrence .",
    "still island diffusion is primarily due to concerted diffusion processes , since it is these that produce largest displacement of center of mass .",
    "this can be easily observed by comparing , for each island size , the effective diffusion barriers given in table  [ teff ] with the activation barriers in the tables given in sect .  [ results ] for concerted diffusion processes : effective diffusion barriers more or less closely follow activation barriers for concerted diffusion processes  except for the 9-atom island , in which the contribution of single - atom processes to the island s diffusion is significantly larger than for other island sizes .      we would like to acknowledge computational resources provided by university of central florida .",
    "we also thank lyman baker for critical reading of the manuscript and oleg trushin for his suggestions during initial stages of this work .",
