    "numerical evidence suggests that these critical quantities are independent of microscopic details like the landau level index or the nature of the disorder potential if corrections to scaling are properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "the results are obtained for models of disordered non - interacting electrons in two dimensions .",
    "the finite extent of the electron wavefunction in the direction perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane does not change the scaling behavior as it only modifies the form factor of the disorder as long as only a single subband of the perpendicular motion is occupied .",

    "the physical coulomb interaction corresponds to @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in order to determine the relevance of this perturbation at the non - interacting fixed point of the renormalization group , we calculate the disorder average @xmath19 of the interaction between two consecutive non - interacting eigenstates and",

    "if @xmath19 scales faster to zero than @xmath20 with increasing system size then the non - interacting eigenstates are essentially unaffected by the interaction and the interaction is irrelevant , while in the opposite case increasingly more eigenstates get coupled with increasing system size and the interaction is relevant in the renormalization group sense . defining the scaling index @xmath37 of the interaction by",
    "@xmath38 we see that for @xmath39 the interactions are irrelevant with a scaling index @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath41 the interactions are still irrelevant but now with the range dependent scaling index @xmath42 . in",
    "both of these cases the fixed point structure is not changed and the critical exponents take on their non - interacting values .",
    "however , even these irrelevant interactions lead to a finite dissipative conductivity at finite temperatures in contrast to the non - interacting system @xcite . for @xmath43 and",
    "hence for coulomb interactions the interactions are relevant with scaling index @xmath42 and the system is driven away from the non - interacting fixed point towards a new interacting fixed point @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the linear stability analysis of the previous section does not tell us what this new fixed point looks like , only that infinitesimally weak interactions are sufficient to take us there .",
    "it is known that for sufficiently strong interactions the qh system develops new correlated ground states associated with the emergence of the fractional qhe @xcite . at these fixed points",
    "the interaction strength is much larger than the disorder .",
    "these are not the fixed points that we are concerned with here .",
    "we want to know the ground state of the system for interaction strength much smaller than the disorder strength .    in order to study the nature of the new fixed point a numerical approach",
    "was chosen .",
    "ideally , an exact method should be used but in the presence of both interactions and disorder exact diagonalization studies are limited to system sizes far too small to allow for any finite - size scaling analysis to extract critical exponents .",
    "we therefore treat the disorder exactly and incorporate the coulomb interactions in a self - consistent hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) .",
    "the first calculation of this kind by yang and macdonald focused on the tunneling density of states ( dos ) and found a linear coulomb gap at all filling factors of the lowest landau band , even at the critical energy @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found that the dos @xmath44 at the fermi energy in a system of linear dimension @xmath45 scales as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a measure of the interaction strength relative to the disorder strength @xmath48 .",
    "note that this suppression of the dos is basically of classical origin and not related to the quantum hall critical point @xcite .",
    "this system size dependence of the dos is in contrast to the size independent dos of the non - interacting system and offers an explanation for a change of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 from 2 to 1 .",
    "the dynamical exponent relates energy and length scales , @xmath49 , and in a non - interacting system this relation is given by the dos .",
    "the corresponding energy and length scales are the mean level spacing @xmath20 and the system size @xmath45 , respectively , @xmath50 i.e. @xmath51 . with interactions",
    ", however , the dos is no longer constant but scales like @xmath52 so that the dynamical exponent is reduced to @xmath53 .",
    "the suppression of the dos is unrelated to the critical point and happens for all values of the fermi energy , but when the fermi energy coincides with the critical energy it changes the critical exponent @xmath3 .",
    "it remains to be checked whether this simple argument holds and whether other critical quantities are also changed by the interactions or not . using the self - consistent hartree - fock eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , yang , macdonald , and huckestein studied the scaling behavior of the participation ratio and compared the thouless numbers of interacting and non - interacting systems @xcite .",
    "the size and energy dependence of the participation ratio could be fitted by the same exponents @xmath12 and @xmath54 that were obtained in the non - interacting system .",
    "the thouless numbers , that are in a non - interacting system a measure of the conductance , also remained unchanged upon inclusion of the interactions , although the relation between the thouless numbers and the conductance is unknown for an interacting system .    in order to directly obtain the conductivity and the dynamical scaling one has to go beyond the self - consistent hfa and include vertex corrections within the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhf ) .",
    "this is the corresponding conserving approximation and while the quantities calculated in the self - consistent hfa are single - particle properties , the tdhf allows to calculate true two - particle properties like the polarization and the conductivity . a finite - size scaling",
    "analysis shows that in the limit of vanishing frequency @xmath5 and wavevector @xmath55 the irreducible polarization @xmath56 scales like @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the static susceptibility @xmath59 vanishes like @xmath55 for small @xmath55 , even when the vertex corrections are included .",
    "hence the scaling variable @xmath60 and the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 is indeed unity . despite the vanishing static susceptibility , the conductivity @xmath61 is finite even in the dc limit as the diffusion coefficient @xmath62 exhibits super - diffusive behavior and diverges in this limit .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the dynamical conductivity @xmath63 as a function of the scaling variable @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the dc conductivity obtained in the limit @xmath64 is independent of the strength of the interaction and is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the scaling in the opposite limit @xmath66 , @xmath67 , is governed by multifractal correlation and allows to extract the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath68 .",
    "both of these values agree within the uncertainties with their non - interacting counterparts .",
    "the numerical calculations are consistent with the picture that the interacting integer qh system is rather peculiar .",
    "the coulomb interaction is relevant at the non - interacting fixed point but drives the system to a new fixed point , the hartree - fock fixed point , that differs from the old one only by the occurrence of the coulomb gap and the associated reduction in the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 .",
    "whether this picture is correct or due to the failure of the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation @xcite could be decided by numerically calculating the scaling dimension of the residual interactions at the hf fixed point , a rather daunting task that has not been attacked so far .",
    "the behavior of the critical energies , the conductivities , and the resistivities as expected from the scaling theory of the iqhe is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . at high magnetic fields ,",
    "the critical energies are located close to the landau energies . at each of the critical points , the hall conductivity changes by exactly 1 ( from here on , we measure all conductivities in units of @xmath69 ) . as no extended states exist below the fermi energy at zero magnetic field , the critical states can only move up in energy as the magnetic field goes to zero @xcite . at fixed fermi energy or particle number ,",
    "the sequence of hall conductivities exhibited by the system as the magnetic field is lowered is thus 012 ",
    "n  210 .",
    "in particular , the transition from the last quantized plateau to the insulator at low fields can only happen from the @xmath10 plateau .",
    "it should be noted that the situation is fundamentally different in lattice models of the qhe . while for weak disorder and strong magnetic fields the low - lying magnetic subbands of a tight - binding band are faithful approximations of the landau bands of the continuum , lattices models show completely different behavior at strong disorder / weak magnetic fields due to the presence of states with negative hall conductivity that are absent in the continuum",
    ". these states can combine with states carrying positive hall conductivity and alter the topology of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .    since the dissipative conductivity is only finite at the plateau transitions , the hall resistivity exhibits as non - monotonic series of plateaus , with the hall resistivity increasing with decreasing magnetic field below the @xmath70 plateau .",
    "this behavior predicted by the scaling theory is in stark contrast to the experimental situation , where only monotonously increasing hall resistivities are observed at low magnetic fields .",
    "even more disturbingly , a series of experiments have observed a temperature independent point with insulating behavior for lower magnetic fields and emerging quantized plateau with @xmath71 for higher magnetic fields @xcite . obviously , if this temperature independent point signals the presence of a quantum critical point at zero temperature , then the experiments are at odds with the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "however , the observed linear , classical behavior of the hall resistivity at low fields gives us a hint how to properly interpret the experimental data .",
    "first , we have to realize that the results of scaling theory , such as the phase diagram of fig .  [ fig:4 ] , deal with the behavior of the system at zero temperature on asymptotically large length scales .",
    "experiments , on the other hand , are performed at finite temperatures and a finite temperature introduces a finite length scale @xmath72 , the phase coherence length . the question , whether or not an experiment performed at a certain temperature reflects the asymptotic scaling regime is thus a question of length scales .    how the conductivities change with length scale is determined by the renormalization group @xmath73-functions of the system .",
    "the exact form of these functions is not known for the qhe , only an approximation for large longitudinal conductivity @xmath74 is given in the literature @xcite .",
    "the structure of the resulting flow diagram is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] @xcite .",
    "the flow starts at high temperatures , corresponding to short length scales , with the semiclassical values of the conductivity .",
    "the physics of the unstable qh fixed points at half - integer @xmath75 becomes apparent at length scales such that the longitudinal conductivity is of the order of 1/2 .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the conductivities are given by the drude expressions @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the carrier density , transport time , and the elastic mean free path , respectively ( fig .",
    "( [ fig:6 ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting linear increase of the hall resistivity is observed in all experiments .",
    "the change of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath74 due to quantum interference is given to lowest order in @xmath82 by the unitary @xmath73-function @xcite @xmath83    while this expression is only valid for large @xmath74 , it can provide a rough estimate of the length scale at which the weak localization corrections become comparable to the bare value @xmath84 , at which point the influence of the qh fixed point becomes dominant .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : uni_cor ] ) , we get the crossover length scale @xmath85 we note the strong dependence of the crossover scale on the bare conductivity @xmath86 . in order to get a handle on the possible values of @xmath84",
    ", we resort to laughlin , who argued that the critical energies are given by the condition , that the drude @xmath87 @xcite , corresponding to the landau energies at high magnetic fields . in order to observe the @xmath88-th hall plateau",
    ", the maximum of @xmath89 at @xmath90 needs to be larger than @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , for magnetic fields up to @xmath90 the bare longitudinal conductivity @xmath84 exceeds @xmath91 . in the experiments that claim to observe direct transitions from higher plateaus , @xmath88 is at least 2 .",
    "the corresponding crossover length scale @xmath92 is then at least several @xmath93 , a macroscopic length , orders of magnitudes larger than any phase coherence length achievable experimentally .",
    "we thus conclude , that at low fields @xmath94 the attainable length scales are too short to observe the qhe , even if it is present in an infinite system . instead",
    ", classical behavior with weak localization corrections is expected , in agreement with experiment .",
    "so far , our discussion does not explain the experimentally observed strong change in the temperature dependence of the resistivities near @xmath90 . instead of the weakly insulating temperature dependence observed at low magnetic fields , at higher magnetic fields the onset of plateau quantization is seen . in order to understand this",
    ", we need to take into account the quantizing effect of the magnetic field . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the disorder broadening of the landau levels becomes smaller than their separation , leading to minima in the density of states .",
    "these minima are accompanied by minima in the bare conductivity @xmath84 . for @xmath96 , the drude result in no longer valid and",
    "the bare conductivity is given by the self - consistent born approximation @xcite . at integer filling factors the bare conductivity becomes small and the crossover length scale becomes microscopic , allowing the observation of qhe .    from these arguments , we expect an almost temperature independent point near @xmath90 separating a weakly temperature dependent , insulating regime at lower magnetic fields from a regime of stronger temperature dependence with emerging quantized hall plateaus , in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "the present discussion leaves a lot of room for improvements .",
    "first , we use only approximate expressions for the bare conductivities .",
    "next , the @xmath73-functions should be calculated all the way from large conductivities to the qh fixed points",
    ". while improvements in both of these areas are highly desirable , they are also hard to come by as the combined effects of finite magnetic field , disorder and interactions need to be taken into account .",
    "we should further distinguish between transport and scattering times , but since the experiments are performed on low mobility samples , there is not much difference . in spite of the limitations , we believe that our discussion captures the essential features of the physical situation .",
    "finally , we want to point out that the whole discussion applies to samples that are actually insulating at zero magnetic field .",
    "it certainly does not apply to samples that are apparently metallic at zero field .",
    "the scaling theory of the plateau transitions in the integer quantum hall effect presents a picture that agrees with a wide range of experimental findings . however , when analyzing experimental or numerical data , it is imperative to consider the characteristic length scales in the system . this need becomes most prominent at low magnetic fields , where the emergence of an enormous crossover length scales prohibits the experimental observation of the qhe .",
    "coulomb interactions appear to play a peculiar role in the iqhe . neglecting them ,",
    "one obtains a theory that correctly reproduces the observed plateaus and even most characteristic features of the transitions .",
    "however , the coulomb interaction is a relevant perturbation at the non - interacting fixed point and the non - interacting theory is not the correct scaling theory . incorporating the effects of the coulomb interaction within a self - consistent time - dependent hartree - fock approximation",
    ", we find that only the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 changes from 2 to 1 , a change that can be traced to the occurrence of a coulomb gap in the tunneling density of states .",

    "<S> the origin of the quantization of the hall conductivity is an excitation gap in the clean system . in the iqhe </S>",
    "<S> this gap is the gap between different landau levels , and hence of single particle origin , while in the fractional qhe electron correlations lead to a gap at magical filling factors @xcite . since electron - electron interactions are unimportant for the origin of the quantization it is tempting to try to describe the iqhe by a theory of non - interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the quantization is most prominent at high magnetic fields where the cyclotron energy is much larger than the disorder , a projection onto a single landau level and the neglect of landau level mixing seems reasonable . </S>",
