    "fractional calculus is a convenient way of introducing memory and nonlocal effects into models of physical systems where integer - valued derivatives and integrals ( for example , the first derivative , the double integral ) are replaced by fractionally - valued derivatives and integrals ( the half - derivative or the 1.5th integral ) .",
    "one advantage is that these extend local nonlinear models to incorporate nonlocal effects @xcite . as far back as 1695 , lhpital asked leibnitz @xcite what happens if the order @xmath0 is allowed to assume fractional values such as @xmath1 , and this began a longstanding quest to define and make use of derivatives and integrals with fractional orders . over the years , a number of different definitions have been proposed by riemann , caputo , liouville , weyl , riesz , feller , and grnwald , @xcite .",
    "fractional generalizations of some of the basic differential equations of physics have led to new understandings of the dynamics underlying macroscopic phenomena in a wide range of areas including anomalous diffusion @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "some of the most common and useful signal and image processing techniques involve linear operations such as derivatives @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and integrals @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 and there have been recent efforts to apply fractional generalizations in a variety of fields such as system identification @xcite , control @xcite , simulations @xcite , and image processing @xcite .",
    "a number of these are reviewed in the next paragraph .    using the grnwald - letnikov definition of fractional derivatives and the mach effect , tseng and",
    "lee @xcite introduced an image sharpening algorithm and demonstrated the effectiveness of their method .",
    "khanna and chandrasekaran @xcite , using the grnwald - letnikov definition proposed a multi - dimensional mask that enhances the image in several directions in one pass .",
    "@xcite concentrated on identifying the blur parameters of motion blurred images and obtained better results with fractional derivatives as opposed to the methods based on integer - order derivatives .",
    "they showed that fractional derivatives offer better immunity to noise and can improve ability to determine motion - blurred direction and extent .",
    "the authors of @xcite discussed partial differential equations and diffusion - based image processing techniques for filtering , denoising , and restoration via fractional calculus .",
    "jun and zhihui @xcite discussed a class of multi - scale variational models for image denoising .",

    "several factors may have limited the adoption of such fractional operators ( also called _",

    "this paper addresses these issues by transforming into the frequency domain where riesz s definition can be applied directly . instead of attempting to derive the time ( or spatial ) analogs of the filters ,",

    "we make the argument that this approach provides both a conceptual simplification and that it typically leads to lower computational complexity .    indeed ,",
    "frequency domain intuition can show clearly what kinds of signal processing effects may be expected from fractional - order filters . for example , applying a fractional integration with order @xmath9 to a signal should be a smoothing operation , a kind of low - pass filter .",

    "the key idea of the riesz fractional definition is to rewrite ( [ eqn : qthder ] ) as @xmath30 and to consider this to be a _ definition _ : the @xmath11th derivative of the function @xmath17 with respect to @xmath31 is defined to be the inverse fourier transform of @xmath32 times the fourier transform of @xmath17 .",
    "the usefulness of this approach is that @xmath11 need not be an integer . moreover , @xmath11 need not be positive . when @xmath33 , for instance , this recaptures the relationship in ( [ eqn : fourierint ] ) ; when @xmath34 , ( [ eqn : riesz ] ) recaptures ( [ eqn : qthder ] ) ( but for the absolute value signs ) .",
    "hence ( [ eqn : riesz ] ) suffices to define both fractional derivatives ( when @xmath11 is positive ) and fractional integrals ( when @xmath11 is negative ) .",
    "some care is needed to make the above argument precise .",
    "first , the formal definition ( details can be found in appendix [ sec : appendixdefs ] ) divides the fourier transform into two parts ( one from @xmath35 to @xmath31 and the other from @xmath31 to @xmath36 ) and it is necessary to replace @xmath37 by @xmath38 to ensure that both integrals converge .",
    "second , the raising of a number to a fractional power does not have a unique answer , but can result in multiple possible answers ( for example , @xmath39 can assume two possible values , one positive and one negative ) .",
    "this can cause sign ambiguities in the value of the fractional derivatives or integrals .",

    "the defining equation ( [ eqn : riesz ] ) is not only a theoretical definition , it can also be used as a basis for computation by replacing the fourier transform with the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) .",

    "the @xmath11th fractional differintegral is straightforwardly implemented in pseudocode as @xmath43 where the power is an element - by - element operation and where fft and ifft represent the dft and its inverse .",

    "normally , this would be a waste of computational effort since there are efficient algorithms for calculating derivatives ( finite differences , differential quadrature , etc . ) and ( [ eqn : pseudocode ] ) requires two dfts .",
    "but it is worth considering an example that shows how ( [ eqn : pseudocode ] ) assumes periodicity .",
    "figure [ fig : derivper ] shows two examples of derivatives calculated via this method ; in the top , the function is periodic and the derivative appears plausible .",
    "for example , it is positive when the slope of the sampled function is increasing and goes to zero when the sampled function flattens out . in the bottom example",
    ", the derivative is not ( as might be expected ) closely related to the derivative of the implied sampled function ( a parabola ) , but rather is the derivative of one period of the periodic extension .",
    "this same factor occurs in all differintegrals calculated via the method ( [ eqn : riesz])-([eqn : pseudocode ] ) .",

    "when this is undesirable , a common approach is to translate the rgb channels into the hue - saturation - brightness ( hsb ) colorspace , to process the brightness channel alone , and then convert back to rgb for display .",
    "this tends to preserve the hue and saturation ( the `` color '' ) while changing the brightness . as with ( integer - valued ) derivative and integral operators",
    ", this can be an effective means of applying differintegral operations to color images .",
    "a series of such images ( with different values of @xmath11 and different skew values ) are shown at the website @xcite .",

    "while it is unreasonable to expect miraculous new kinds of processing effects from these tools , they do provide a logical extension to current techniques .",
    "since derivatives and integrals are at the heart of many different classical signal processing algorithms , it is reasonable to ask , in each case , whether the use of fractional - order filters may enhance these applications . in order to test whether the methods are useful in a given application , the authors provide computer code in both mathematica and in matlab to easily carry out the required calculations @xcite .",
    "appendix [ app : rldef ] begins with the riemann - liouville ( rl ) definitions of fractional integrals and derivatives .",
    "transforming into the frequency domain , as in appendices [ app : rieszint ] and [ app : rieszder ] , allows restatement of the definitions that hold under fairly general conditions .",
    "this formulation was first described by riesz @xcite .",

    "at first it might seem odd to use the letter @xmath88 for an integral ; doing so allows a unified notation where a positive exponent means `` derivative '' and a negative exponent means `` integral . '' when @xmath34 , this corresponds to the `` regular '' integral from @xmath110 to @xmath31 of the function @xmath111 .",
    "the definition of the fractional derivative is less straightforward because the integral in ( [ eqn : rightrlint ] ) diverges for @xmath112 .",
