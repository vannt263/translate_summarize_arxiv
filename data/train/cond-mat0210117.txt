    "one of the major motors of research in statistical physics has been the quest to understand the link between macroscopic phenomena and the underlying microscopic physics of a system . in particular , the origin of the macroscopic `` laws '' of thermodynamic transport is still one of the major challenges to theoretical physics .",
    "these phenomenological laws are known to describe accurately the processes of diffusion , heat conduction , viscosity among a host of other phenomena , and are fundamental to the quantitative description of macroscopic systems in general",
    ". however , the attempts to link these macroscopic laws to the underlying microscopic dynamics have not been conclusive thus far . from a mathematically rigorous point of view",
    ", very few results have been obtained @xcite .",
    "indeed , to our knowledge , the validity of fourier s law has been proven analytically only for a very specific model in the limit of infinite dilution with finite mean free path @xcite .",
    "there have also been attempts to link transport phenomena to the chaotic properties of the underlying classical dynamics @xcite ; and a connection between the rate of entropy production and the rate of contraction of phase space volume in thermostated ( non hamiltonian ) systems has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "given this state of affairs , a common strategy is to propose and study systems which reproduce , in numerical simulations , the phenomena under consideration , and to attempt to determine how the physical ingredients of these models give rise to the macroscopic behaviour .",
    "however , the systems considered thus far have been either too complicated to shed much light upon the problem , or have actually failed to reproduce the macroscopic phenomenology .",
    "attempts have been made , on one side , through the simulation of realistic many - body systems satisfying a thermostated dynamics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations have indeed been able to reproduce non - trivial transport phenomena .",
    "however , such studies do not provide a detailed understanding of the microscopic processes involved due to the excessive complexity of the system under study .",
    "the other numerical approach involves the study of transport in `` simple systems '' .",
    "examples of these include : chains of anharmonic oscillators @xcite and the so called ding - a - ling and ding - dong models @xcite , among others . of these ,",
    "energy transport in the chains was shown to be `` anomalous '' .",
    "this is an euphemism indicating that energy transport can not be described as a diffusive process and currents do not scale with the gradients in the expected way .",
    "in contrast , `` normal '' transport indicates that even in the thermodynamic limit , transport can accurately be described as a diffusive process and that the flux is proportional to the gradient as stated , say , in fourier s law .",
    "the ding - a - ling and ding - dong models , indeed do yield normal transport under certain conditions ; however , they include geometric constraints that make even their equilibrium properties an extremely complicated affair .",
    "as we shall see , the knowledge of such equilibrium properties is often useful , which is why we consider it important to have a model where these are explicitly known .",
    "one particularly thorny problem in attempting to reproduce the phenomenological laws of thermodynamic transport , is that these apply to systems which are characterized by local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) @xcite .",
    "that is , systems that are not in equilibrium , but for which the intensive thermodynamic variables are well defined at each point of the system , and the relations amongst these variables are the same as in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "thus , results have been obtained concerning `` diffusive '' ( normal ) energy transport in the lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "yet this system is not described by lte @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not clear what precise meaning can be attached to the local temperature appearing in fourier s law in this situation .    under these circumstances ,",
    "the minimal ingredients required in the microscopic physics of a simple system to attain normal thermodynamic transport in low dimensions are presently still under discussion @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that ideal candidate models should possess the following features :    1 .   the microscopic physics should be defined in terms of reversible hamiltonian dynamics , since this is the nature of known fundamental processes . in particular , reversible systems showing an average rate of phase space contraction ,",
    "while of considerable interest for simulating transport , do not provide a fundamental microscopic model .",
    "2 .   the equilibrium properties of the model should be well understood .",
    "3 .   when driven weakly out of equilibrium , they must be consistent with the hypotheses of lte and , of course , they must give rise to realistic macroscopic transport .    in this work we present a detailed description and extensive simulations of the equilibrium and transport properties of a simple reversible hamiltonian model system which we believe is an ideal candidate to begin to unravel the puzzle of thermodynamic transport .",
    "the first results concerning some of the transport features of this model were presented in @xcite . in section  [ sec : model ] , we present a detailed description and discussion of the model . we show that its equilibrium statistical mechanics is simply that of an ideal gas .    in order to carry out the equilibrium simulations , as well as to study the transport properties of the model when the system is driven out of equilibrium , it is necessary to couple the system to thermo - chemical baths .",
    "we describe the model baths we have implemented to do this in section  [ sec : baths ] .    in section  [ sec : lte ]",
    "we corroborate through simulations that the equilibrium state of the system in the three canonical ensembles is indeed an ideal gas .",
    "we also present numerical evidence to show that , when subjected to a weak temperature and/or chemical potential gradient , our systems reaches a non - equilibrium steady state ( nss ) which is characterized by lte . in this situation , our model supports both heat and matter flows .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : transport ] that these flows are characterized by transport coefficients which are independent of system size ( that is , transport is normal ) , and that the corresponding transport coefficients satisfy onsager s reciprocity relations .",
    "the fact that the system is homogeneous in energy allows the prediction of the dependence of the transport coefficients on the temperature .",
    "we also establish numerically their dependence on the particle density and discuss briefly the effects of subjecting the system to a magnetic field . in section  [ sec : green - kubo ] we verify that the green - kubo formulas connecting transport coefficients with time correlation functions apply for this system to within numerical precision , and we compare the effect of an applied electric field with that of an applied chemical potential gradient , which , to linear order , should induce the same flows in the system . in section",
    "[ sec : entropy ] a brief discussion of the applicability of microscopic interpretations of entropy production as motor of transport in this system .",
    "finally we present a brief summary and mention how this model can be modified to study other physical transport problems from a microscopic approach .",
    "in @xcite , a lorentz gas model with elastic collisions was used to study heat transport in a quasi - one dimensional channel placed between two thermal reservoirs at different nominal temperatures .",
    "while the results were consistent with some sort of `` diffusive '' energy transport , identification with fourier s law was unfounded : the system does not satisfy the hypothesis of lte and , therefore , one can not define a local temperature , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "there , the authors argue that the system does not attain lte due to the existence of an infinite number ( in the thermodynamic limit ) of conserved quantities in the dynamics . indeed , the energy of each particle is conserved throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "this , in turn , implies a breakdown of ergodicity and the resulting process is closer to `` colour '' diffusion than to heat transport .",
    "the model we study in this work , introduced in @xcite , is a modification to the usual lorentz gas model in which the scatterers are allowed to exchange energy with a set of ( non - interacting ) point particles of mass @xmath0 through the scattering events .",
    "the geometry we consider is that of a periodic lorentz gas in which the hard disc scatterers of radius @xmath1 are fixed on a triangular lattice , the details of which are discussed below .",
    "the possibility of energy exchange is achieved as follows : each disc is a free rotator with a moment of inertia @xmath2 , and scattering proceeds according to rules characterizing `` perfectly rough '' collisions , that are reversible , conserve total energy and angular momentum .",
    "these collision rules are given by the following formulas , which relate the normal and tangential components of the particle s velocity @xmath3 with respect to the disc s surface , and the disc s angular velocity @xmath4 before ( unprimed quantities ) and after ( primed quantities ) the collision @xmath5    these rules define a deterministic , time - reversible , canonical transformation at each collision .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 , defined as the ratio between the moment of inertia of the disc and the mass of the particle times the square radius of the disc : @xmath7 is the only relevant adimensional parameter characterizing the collision .",
    "it determines the energy transfer between discs and particles in a collision . for finite values of @xmath6 , particles in the system may exchange energy among each other through the discs , even though they do not interact directly .",
    "this simple energy exchange mechanism overcomes the objections raised in @xcite and permits the system to reach thermodynamical equilibrium , as we will see in section  [ sec : lte ] . as @xmath8 , the rotational energy of the scatterers becomes negligible and the collision becomes perfectly elastic , recovering the dynamics of the usual lorentz gas model . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the energy of the scatterers is unaffected by the collisions with the particles , and the angular velocity of the scatterers remains constant . in this limit , once again , the system does not equilibrate .",
    "thus , in either limit , the energy - mediating effect is suppressed and thermodynamical equilibrium is not reached . in the following ,",
    "unless the contrary is explicitly stated , we shall always be dealing with the case @xmath10 , since that is a value of @xmath6 for which energy exchange , and therefore equilibration , is quite efficient .",
    "the geometric disposition of the scatterers in the systems we study in this work is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : channel ] .",
    "the centers of the scatterers are fixed on a triangular lattice , along a narrow channel of height @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between the centers of the scatterers . for convenience , this distance was chosen as @xmath13 ( known in the literature as the critical horizon ) , which is the largest separation for which a particle can not travel arbitrarily large distances without undergoing a collision . in this geometry , a set of non - interacting point particles of mass @xmath0 moves freely between collisions with the hard discs . in the vertical direction",
    "the channel contains two discs and periodic boundary conditions are imposed .    the fact that we put two discs in the vertical direction merits comment as , in the simpler `` single cell '' geometry with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", spurious effects may arise from multiple successive scatterings of one particle with the same disc .",
    "some of these effects have been observed in @xcite , where the same set of collision equations has been used to model a deterministic thermostat .",
    "we have verified that if one considers a system consisting of one cell with periodic boundary conditions , containing a single scatterer and a single particle , the resulting dynamics gives rise to regular structures in the phase space of the particle . in this situation",
    ", the system does not appear to be ergodic for arbitrary values of @xmath6 .",
    "we also noted that , if instead of periodic boundary conditions one considers specular reflections at the boundaries , the effect in the particle s trajectory is a `` randomization '' of the tangential component of the particle s velocity in the next collision with the disc , recovering a seemingly ergodic phase space .",
    "though we believe that the presence of other particles will destroy the regular structures that appear in the single particle case , we decided to avoid the possibility of multiple consecutive collisions of a particle with the same disc by placing two discs in the vertical direction .",
    "schematic illustration of the scatterer geometry : the scatterers are disposed on a triangular array with finite horizon to avoid infinitely long trajectories . for matters of convenience , in this work the separation between scatterers has been set to have the critical horizon .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in the vertical direction . to avoid spurious effects arising from multiple consecutive scatterings of a particle off the same disc ,",
    "we have put two discs on each vertical . to study the dependence with system size ,",
    "the length l of the sample is varied .",
    "the quoted length is the number of discs . ]",
    "a central aspect of this model is that its equilibrium properties are still trivial , even though , strictly speaking , it is an interacting many particle system .",
    "indeed , in spite of the modified collision rules , the energy of the system is given by @xmath14    thus , all statistical mechanics calculations for this system coincide with those of a system consisting of a two dimensional ideal gas plus a collection of non - interacting free rotors .",
    "hence , a first test for the system is to verify that it equilibrates to a state in which its statistical properties are indeed those predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics . in particular , in microcanonical simulations , the particle velocities should reach maxwellian distributions at a uniform `` temperature '' consistent with the equipartition theorem @xcite .",
    "these temperatures should also characterize the distribution of angular velocities of the rotating scatterers . the same should be true in canonical and grand canonical simulations , where the temperature and particle density ( or , more formally , the chemical potential divided by the temperature ) are now those established by the values of the baths . furthermore , the equations of state characterizing ideal gases should describe the thermodynamics of our system . if any of these tests fails , it could be argued that the system fails to equilibrate probably due to a lack of ergodicity .",
    "unfortunately , passing all the tests does not prove that the system is ergodic .",
    "we have not succeeded in showing rigorously that this system is ergodic .",
    "however , these numerical tests are fairly stringent : we shall see that for the case of an imposed external magnetic field , where ergodicity is known to be violated , an effect indeed appears in the energy distribution function of the particles .",
    "in numerical studies of statistical mechanics systems in general , and in those on the microscopic origin of macroscopic transport in particular , it is necessary to define models for the thermodynamical reservoirs in addition to the dynamics of the system .",
    "the design of these reservoirs and the way these interact with the system , has several subtleties that can produce confusing and , very often , wrong results , as has been pointed out in @xcite . in this section",
    ", we explain the design of a stochastic model that simulates a thermo - chemical bath , which is able to exchange energy and particles with the system at fixed nominal values for the temperature @xmath15 and chemical potential @xmath16 .    the heat and matter reservoir",
    "is taken to be an infinite ideal gas at temperature @xmath15 and density @xmath17 which is placed in direct contact with the system being studied .",
    "this is achieved by assuming that the wall separating the system from the reservoir is perfectly transparent to particles impinging on it from either side .",
    "of course , it is not necessary to simulate explicitly the infinite ideal gas which acts as the thermodynamical reservoir , instead , we can implement this set up using the following rules : whenever a particle of the system impinges on the boundary which separates it from the bath , it is removed . on the other hand , with a frequency @xmath18 ,",
    "particles are generated at the boundary , with a velocity distribution @xmath19 reflecting the assumption that the bath is an ideal gas ( here and in the following , we take the particle mass and boltzmann s constant equal to one ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath15 in these equations defines the nominal temperature of the bath .",
    "moreover , this way of implementing the thermo - chemical baths also fixes a nominal value for their chemical potential .",
    "again , as the bath is an ideal gas , the rate @xmath18 is given by : @xmath20 thus , we can express the chemical potential of the bath in terms of the parameter @xmath18 as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an irrelevant constant .",
    "equations ( [ eq : dist ] ) , ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) completely define the algorithm for the stochastic emission process of the thermo - chemical baths used in the simulations , and allow us to control the chemical potential and temperature of the walls by varying the rate @xmath18 and the temperature . these walls were used for grand canonical simulations in equilibrium and coupled heat and matter transport simulations in the nss .    to simulate the canonical ensemble in equilibrium and pure heat flow in the nss ,",
    "diathermal impermeable walls are required .",
    "these were achieved by reflecting each particle that impinged on the wall back into the system , with its velocity updated according to the distribution function ( [ eq : dist ] ) , which again defines the nominal temperature of the thermal bath .    finally , in order to perform simulations in the microcanonical ensemble , insulating walls are required .",
    "we have simulated these either by simply considering that the particles always perform elastic specular reflection at the boundary , or by having no walls at all and considering periodic boundary conditions .    a generalized model for thermo - chemical bath , as well as a general approach allowing to verify the validity of a given procedure for generating such baths",
    "is given in appendix [ app - a ] .",
    "in this section we show that the system described in section  [ sec : model ] reaches a well defined equilibrium state for the different equilibrium ensembles . for each ensemble",
    "we place the system in contact with the appropriate wall , as described in the previous section .",
    "however , as expected , the equilibrium state that the system reaches does not depend on the particular choice of the ensemble .",
    "furthermore , when the nominal values for the thermodynamical quantities fixed by the baths impose a gradient in temperature and/or in the chemical potential , our model reaches a well defined steady state .    in order to show that our model reaches a satisfactory equilibrium state we have measured the velocity distribution of the particles @xmath23 and the angular velocity distribution of the discs @xmath24 in a microcanonical simulation in which the particles undergo specular reflections with the walls at the left and right extremes of the channel",
    "we have fixed the energy of the system and distributed it randomly among discs and particles .",
    "after some relaxation time the mean energy per particle is twice the mean energy per disc , thus satisfying the equipartition theorem . in fig .  [",
    "fig : equi - dists ] , the measured distributions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are shown .",
    "the solid line is the corresponding boltzmann distributions at the expected temperature ( @xmath25 in arbitrary units ) .",
    "the agreement indicates that both discs and particles have reached a state consistent with the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "this agreement also allows us to relate the average energy per particle with the temperature , which would have been unfounded otherwise .",

    "the solid lines correspond to the boltzmann distribution at the expected temperature @xmath25 . ]",
    "we have computed the particle density and temperature profiles in the following way : we divide the channel in @xmath28 disjoint slabs of width @xmath29 .",
    "as before , @xmath30 is the length of the channel in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "the particle density , @xmath32 , in each slab is computed as the time average @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the position of the @xmath35-th particle at time @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the total number of particles in the channel that , in the case of a grand canonical situation , depends on time .",
    "the time average is performed after the steady state has been reached .    similarly , the time averaged energy density @xmath38 is computed as @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the energy of the @xmath35-th particle at time @xmath36 . from ( [ eq : concentration ] )",
    "we obtain the particle s density profile @xmath41 as the mean number of particles found in the slab which contains the position @xmath31",
    "@xmath42    the integral in ( [ eq : density - profile ] ) is taken over the domain of the slab that contains position @xmath31 .",
    "analogously , the average particle energy @xmath43 at the slab containing position @xmath31 is given by @xmath44    with ( [ eq : density - profile ] ) and ( [ eq : energy - profile ] ) , we calculate the particle temperature profile @xmath45 as @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : equi - t - profile ] , we show the temperature profile obtained in a canonical simulation where both baths were set to the same nominal temperature . the temperature obtained according to ( [ eq : temperature - profile ] )",
    "has additionally been averaged over an ensemble of @xmath47 different realizations .",
    "the number of particles was set to @xmath48 in a channel of length @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that the particles reach an equilibrium state characterized by a constant temperature along the channel which coincides with the nominal values of the baths temperature .",
    "moreover , the open circles in fig .  [ fig : equi - t - profile ] correspond to the time averaged energy of the discs .",
    "the agreement of both profiles indicates equilibration between particles and discs .    in this equilibrium state , the particle s density profile ( not shown ) , is also flat .",

    "the number of particles was @xmath48 and @xmath27 .",
    "the nominal temperature in both baths was set to same value @xmath25 .",
    "the open circles correspond to the time averaged temperature of the discs . ]",
    "let us finally note the following : we have also performed simulations involving an external magnetic field .",
    "in this case , it is immediately clear that the system is not ergodic . indeed",
    ", there exist isolated circular orbits which do not touch any disc .",
    "since particles do not interact directly , any particle originally on one of these orbits will remain for ever .",
    "similarly , this set of orbits can not be reached from initial conditions for which each particle touches one disc at least once .",
    "of course , for small fields , the orbits that do not touch any scatterer only occur when the particle s kinetic energy is low , but since the particles can exchange energy with the discs , the kinetic energy of a particle can come arbitrarily close to zero , and there will be regions that become unreachable for this particle .",
    "there is thus a true lack of ergodicity for this system for arbitrary ( non zero ) magnetic fields and at all temperatures , although the effect becomes weaker as the field decreases .",
    "we have plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : magnetic ] the distribution of particle energies in the microcanonical ensemble and clear deviations from the boltzmann distribution are observed .",
    "this comes as an indication that the tests we have applied should disclose a lack of ergodicity in the system without magnetic field if such were present .",
    "particle s energy distribution obtained from a microcanonical simulation with an applied external magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the field @xmath49 is such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath0 are the electric charge and mass of the particles respectively and @xmath52 is the speed of light .",
    "the lack of low energy particles is evident . in the inset",

    "we now turn to the more interesting out of equilibrium situation . in these simulations",
    "we connect the two ends of the system with two different baths , each of which has given values of the chemical potential and the temperature .",
    "to drive the system out of equilibrium , the nominal values of the temperatures and chemical potentials of these baths are set to differ by fixed amounts . under these conditions ,",

    "the profile of the average energy per particle is linear and coincides at the boundaries with the nominal baths temperature . as in equilibrium , in the steady state discs and particles locally equilibrate to the same value of the local mean energy per particle , giving a first indication of the establishment of lte .",

    "we now turn to the verification that lte holds for our system .",
    "the assumption of lte consists in the following : in every `` infinitesimal '' volume element one can define thermodynamic variables in the usual way and these are related to each other through the relations which hold for the system at equilibrium .",
    "it should be emphasized from the outset that this assumption is never exact : there always exist corrections of the order of the gradients imposed on the system .",
    "however , by choosing sufficiently small gradients it is always possible to reach a situation in which a definition of the temperature and density variables as if the volume element was in equilibrium , leads to reasonable values for the local chemical potential .",
    "let us first discuss the issue of defining the temperature : in thermal equilibrium it is well known that the particle energies have a boltzmann distribution .",
    "we may therefore define temperature as the parameter characterizing this distribution , arguing that temperature is ill - defined if the distribution is not boltzmann . to this end",

    "[ fig : lte-2 ] that @xmath45 coincides with the mean energy of the particles measured locally at the position @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : mu - profile ] , we now compare the dependence on @xmath31 of the quantity @xmath70 with a linear profile between the nominal values of @xmath69 in the thermo - chemical baths for the same simulation .",
    "the agreement between both curves ( the profile of @xmath70 has been shifted for comparison ) , indicates that @xmath71 , supporting the fact that the gas of particles inside the channel behaves locally as an ideal gas . by this",
    "we mean that the relation between the chemical potential , the density and the temperature for an ideal gas in equilibrium holds good locally to an excellent approximation in the nss under study .    there is , however , an obvious discrepancy : since the nss generally carries a non - zero particle current , it is clear that the average velocity is non - vanishing , thereby contradicting the maxwellian distribution for the velocities .",
    "this is shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamberto ] where the deviation from the maxwell distribution given in terms of ratio @xmath72 is plotted .",
    "the systematic positive value of @xmath73 is an indication that the average velocity is greater than zero @xcite .",
    "this velocity , however , is proportional to the particle current , and hence to the gradients .",
    "since these must be assumed small for lte to hold , it is a small effect , which vanishes in the relevant limit . at this point",
    ", it is worthwhile to make the following point , when one states that a model such as that defined in @xcite does not satisfy lte , it means that the deviations from lte do not decrease as the gradients . in that case , for example , they only decay as the imposed temperature _ difference _ goes to zero , which in the thermodynamic limit is a much more stringent condition .",

    "having shown that we can assign an unambiguous meaning to local thermodynamical quantities in the non equilibrium steady states reached by the system , we can now study the transport properties of our systems , and whether these comply with the predictions of irreversible thermodynamics .    from the general theory of irreversible processes ,",
    "to linear order , the heat and particle currents @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be written as follows ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath77 and the onsager reciprocity relations read in this case @xmath78 we now wish to show a central feature of our model : namely that its transport properties are _ normal _ , meaning that the various transport coefficients appearing in ( [ eq : phenom - eqs ] ) do not depend on the length of system , and are thus well defined in the thermodynamical limit . in fig .",

    "our system is well - suited to this purpose , since its dynamics is quite transparent and its equilibrium behaviour is trivial .    in our system , it is clear that phase space volume can only be created or annihilated at the boundaries , due to the conservation of phase space throughout the internal dynamics ( note that the collision rules ( [ eq : collision ] ) are volume preserving ) . to estimate the variations in phase space volume induced by the incoming and outgoing particles , we proceed as follows :",

    "a particle entering at one end of the system therefore contributes to the change in phase space volume @xmath167 by changing both the the local energy per unit volume and the local particle density .",

    "due to stationarity , however , it is clear that    @xmath171    putting ( [ eq : flow ] ) into ( [ eq : s - increase ] ) , one obtains the expression for the rate of production of the phase space volume : @xmath172 .",

    "this can be interpreted in two complementary ways . at first",
    ", one might argue that if a system has ever contracting phase space volume , it must eventually end up on an invariant set of measure zero .",
    "this is in fact quite reasonable and in good agreement with various findings on the dynamics of reversible thermostated systems . indeed",
    ", various people @xcite have found that the invariant measure for such systems is singular with respect to liouville measure .",
    "if we were to generalize such an assumption to our system , it would mean that the invariant measure of the stationary state it eventually reaches is also singular with respect to liouville measure , which would in turn signify that the total phase space volume of the steady state is zero . in principle , this seems amenable to a numerical test , but this is not really the case : due to the rather high dimensionality of our system , the fractality of the support of the steady state measure is presumably extremely difficult to observe , if it is at all possible .",
    "therefore , even if we could connect entropy production , say , with some kind of escape rate ( as proposed by gaspard and coworkers @xcite ) , it is not at all clear how to measure such a quantity in even so simple a model as ours . whether truly low - dimensional systems exist , for which such quantities are readily accessible and which also exhibit lte and normal transport ,",
    "is an interesting open problem .",
    "another interpretation of ( [ eq : s - prod ] ) is the following : in the stationary state , because we are in fact in lte , that is , approximately in a state of thermal equilibrium in every volume element , we may think that at least the _ coarse grained _ phase space volume , measured by the thermodynamical entropy , will remain constant in steady state .",
    "but if , as claimed in ( [ eq : s - prod ] ) , an amount of phase space volume leaves the system each unit of time , then an equivalent amount of coarse - grained phase space volume must be produced inside the system .",
    "that this last statement does not contradict liouville s theorem is , of course , well - known from traditional examples in statistical mechanics .",
    "such an interpretation might then justify the interpretation of the r.h.s of ( [ eq : s - prod ] ) as minus the rate of entropy production , in conformity with the results stated for reversible thermostated systems .    to make such an identification plausible",
    ", we need a definition of the entropy out of equilibrium .",
    "it is well - known that in the general case such a definition poses formidable problems .",
    "however , since our system is an ideal gas but little perturbed from equilibrium , it is possible to use boltzmann s expression for an entropy density per unit volume in terms of the one - particle distribution function @xmath174 , defined by @xmath175 from this one may give an elementary expression for the rate of entropy production through the following considerations .",

    "as shown in ( [ fig : lamberto ] ) such a correction has been observed in our system .",

    "if one takes it as given by ( [ eq : current1 ] ) , we obtain again the rate of entropy production given by the standard expression , this time with the correct positive sign .",

    "we performed extensive numerical studies of the system both in equilibrium and in non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "we find that when driven out of equilibrium , the properties of the system are consistent with the hypothesis of local thermal equilibrium , that is , in the stationary state , one finds a local boltzmann distribution for the energies , leading therefore to an unambiguous definition of the local temperature , chemical potential , etc .",
    "in this situation its transport properties are found to be entirely similar to those of realistic interacting many particle systems : it exhibits coupled mass and heat transport and the two cross transport coefficients satisfy onsager s relations . when time reversal invariance is broken by means of an applied constant magnetic field , the appropriate generalizations of the onsager relations hold .",
    "this is the case even though this system turns out not to be ergodic .",
    "furthermore , we find extremely satisfactory agreement between the values of the transport coefficients as deduced from the equilibrium dynamics via the green  kubo formulas and those obtained via direct simulation .",
    "a final result of interest is that we were able to show equivalence between an applied electric field and a chemical potential gradient .",
    "this result , while a straightforward consequence of linear response , does not appear at all obvious from the microscopic point of view .",
    "it may therefore be considered as a further confirmation of the validity of the linear response formalism    the fact that all these features are present in such a simple model , suggests that it may serve as an ideal framework to gain insight of how macroscopic transport phenomena arise in real systems .",

    "<S> , a stationary state is attained for which local thermal equilibrium holds for low values of the imposed gradients . </S>",
    "<S> transport in this system is normal , in the sense that the transport coefficients which characterize the flow of heat and matter are finite in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the two flows are non - trivially coupled , satisfying onsager s reciprocity relations to within numerical accuracy as well as the green - kubo relations . </S>",
    "<S> we further show numerically that an applied electric field causes the same currents as the corresponding chemical potential gradient in first order of the applied field . puzzling discrepancies in higher order effects ( joule heating ) </S>",

    "<S> finally , the role of entropy production in this purely hamiltonian system is shortly discussed . </S>"
