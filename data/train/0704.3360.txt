    "this age spread , which is not present in the galactic globular cluster population , combined with the close proximity of the lmc system , means that these objects have proved vital to our understanding of star cluster formation and evolution .",
    "furthermore , the age and metallicity distributions of the lmc clusters , together with their kinematics , offer important insights into the formation and subsequent development of the lmc itself .    as part of a study of the structural evolution of massive stellar clusters ,",

    "many of the target clusters have not previously been investigated in any detail , and we are therefore working on deriving accurate photometric ages and metallicities for the sample @xcite . while reducing our observations of the poorly - studied rich intermediate - age lmc cluster ngc 1846 , we recently noticed that the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for this object exhibited a very peculiar main sequence turn - off region ; further scrutiny revealed clearly the presence of two distinct turn - offs . with a few notable exceptions ( for example , the massive galactic globular cluster @xmath9 centauri )",
    ", the vast majority of star clusters which have been resolved by observations into individual stars are comprised of single stellar populations  that is , groups of stars formed at the same time and with the same chemical composition .",
    "ngc 1846 is therefore an important object , as it can potentially offer us new insights into the processes of star and star cluster formation .    in this paper",
    "we present our photometry of ngc 1846 together with a detailed investigation of its extremely unusual cmd ( sections [ s : data ] and [ ss : cmd ] ) .",
    "we examine the spatial distribution of stars in the main sequence turn - off region , and demonstrate that both turn - offs are clearly associated with the cluster rather than being an artifact introduced by field star contamination ( section [ ss : spatial ] ) .",
    "in addition , we show that neither differential reddening , nor a significant line - of - sight depth to ngc 1846 can explain the double turn - off . from isochrone",
    "fitting , we determine the ages and metallicities of the two populations present in ngc 1846 ( section [ ss : isochrone ] ) , and use these results to constrain the possible means by which this object can have been formed ( section [ s : discussion ] ) .",

    ", the width of the cluster rgb appears to increase significantly . examining the data quality flags produced by dolphot we found that all stars above this level were flagged as being saturated in their central pixels ( see e.g. , the brightest stars in fig .",

    "the accuracy of all photometry on the rgb above @xmath33 is therefore dubious , and the apparent increased spread is most likely artificial .",
    "based on an unpublished cmd , @xcite suggested that ngc 1846 suffers from differential reddening ; however , from the narrow ( lower ) rgb and the compact rc visible in fig . [",
    "f : cmdrad ] we see no evidence for significant differential reddening , at least in the central regions of the cluster .",
    "certainly the apparent double main sequence turn - off can not be produced by such an effect without introducing a large spread into the other features on the cluster cmd .",
    "similarly , the observed lack of such a spread in these features militates against a large line - of - sight depth in the system being responsible for the properties of the turn - off region .",
    "the most intriguing aspect of the cmd for ngc 1846 is the double main sequence turn - off .",
    "such a clearly defined example has not previously been observed in a magellanic cloud cluster  indeed , it is rare to find such a feature in _ any _ type of star cluster .",

    "this observation strongly implies that these objects are associated with the cluster itself rather than representing any type of field star contamination .",

    "selection of this size represents a trade - off between high spatial resolution and having a significant number of stars per bin for the turn - off plots ; we retained the same box size for the plot including all stars to allow direct comparison . after calculating the histogram we smoothed the result using the min_curve_surf function in idl , and then obtained a contour map using the contour procedure in idl .",

    "[ f : contours ] shows that the cluster considered as a whole appears to be relatively smoothly and symmetrically distributed .",
    "the centre matches well our measured value of @xmath26 , and there is no strong evidence for significant ellipticity or clumpiness . from the upper two panels , it is clear that the two sets of turn - off stars are very definitely associated with the cluster , as we surmised from fig .",
    "[ f : toradial ] . in addition , within the accuracy of centroiding from the maps ( roughly @xmath41 pixels , or @xmath42 ) their centres are coincident with each other and the cluster as a whole .",
    "it is possible that the set of upper turn - off stars is more centrally concentrated than both the set of lower turn - off stars and the cluster as a whole ( this would be consistent with fig . [",
    "f : toradial ] ) , and furthermore , that the distribution of upper turn - off stars may also exhibit some significant asymmetry . however , both improved photometry of the turn - off region and a more sophisticated statistical analysis are required to draw a firm conclusion on these issues",

    "[ f : toradial ] and [ f : contours ] offer strong evidence that both sets of turn - off stars are definitely associated with ngc 1846 rather than any field star population .",
    "furthermore , there are tantalizing indications that the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn - off stars may be somewhat different to each other , although improved measurements are required to confirm this .      from the above analysis , we conclude that the observed double main sequence turn - off in ngc 1846 results from the presence of two separate stellar populations in this cluster . however , even though the two main sequence turn - offs are quite distinct , the rgb ( below the saturation level at @xmath33 ) is narrow , and the rc is of a compact nature .",
    "this implies that the two populations can not be of strongly differing metallicities , since both the rgb and the rc of a more metal rich population would lie considerably further to the red than those for a more metal poor population , and the rc would also be somewhat less luminous for the more metal rich population than for the metal poor population .    to quantify the main characteristics ( age , metallicity ) of the two populations in ngc 1846 , we fit isochrones to the cluster cmd .",
    "we used two sets of stellar models which have isochrones calculated in the f555w and f814w acs / wfc filter systems  those of the padova group @xcite , and those from the basti evolutionary code @xcite .",

    "we first attempted to find the best fitting isochrone for the upper main sequence turn - off .",
    "we did this by locating by eye three fiducial points on the cmd of the cluster s central region : the magnitude and colour of the turn - off , the magnitude of the rc , and the colour of the rgb at a level @xmath54 mag brighter than the level of the turn - off .",
    "this latter point was selected simply as a point lying on the lower rgb at a level intermediate between that of the red end of the sgb and that of the rc .",
    "we then calculated the intervals @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are , respectively , the difference in magnitude between the level of the turn - off and the level of the rc , and the difference in colour between the turn - off and the rgb fiducial point .",
    "these intervals are useful because @xmath55 is strongly sensitive to cluster age ( and weakly to cluster metallicity ) , while @xmath56 is sensitive to both cluster age and metallicity .",
    "we obtained @xmath57 mag and @xmath58 mag .",
    "next , we calculated the same intervals for all isochrones on each of our two grids , and selected only those with values lying within certain tolerances of the cluster measurements ( @xmath59 mag for @xmath55 and @xmath60 mag for @xmath56 ) .",
    "this resulted in lists of fewer than ten isochrones per grid , which we then fit to the cmd by eye . to do this , we calculated the offsets in magnitude and colour required to align the turn - off of the isochrone with that of the cmd , and then those required to align the rc of the isochrone with that of the cmd .",
    "this resulted in two offsets in magnitude , and two offsets in colour , which we averaged and then applied to overplot the isochrone on the cmd .",
    "given the narrowness of most of the sequences on the cmd , it was then straightforward to identify the best fitting isochrone for each grid .",
    "the resulting offsets @xmath61 and @xmath62 provide estimates for the distance modulus to the cluster ( @xmath63 ) and the foreground extinction , in that @xmath64 ( since the extinction values are small , see * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath65 .",
    "we then moved to the lower turn - off and repeated the above process . in section [ ss : spatial ] , we demonstrated that both populations in ngc 1846 share an approximately common spatial centre .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in such complexes , cluster formation can be spread over several hundred myr .",
    "furthermore , clusters observed to be physically associated at present do not have to have been formed this way , as the cross - section for tidal capture is much increased due to the relatively high density of star clusters within the scg .",
    "this scenario therefore allows for the existence of cluster pairs which are older than the typical time - scale for merging , as well as for cluster pairs with large age differences , both of which types are seen in the lmc .",
    "if the two components of ngc 1846 were formed in a scg in the same giant molecular cloud , this also naturally explains their matching metal abundances .    in this scenario ,",
    "the two clusters comprising the present day ngc 1846 must have merged less than @xmath88 gyr ago , based on our derived ages for the upper turn - off population .",
    "the median relaxation time in intermediate - age lmc clusters is typically of order @xmath89 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the central relaxation time may be up to a factor ten shorter than this .",
    "the very inner region of ngc 1846 is therefore quite possibly dynamically old enough for two merging clusters to now be sharing a common centre and be fairly well mixed through relaxation processes ; however it is probable that asymmetries could still exist outside the core , as our observations have hinted .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to investigate the evolution of a merged lmc - type cluster via realistic @xmath90-body modelling to examine if the observed features of ngc 1846 can be reproduced .",
    "such calculations may allow the time when merging occurred to be constrained  this would be extremely useful in the context of examining the scg scenario .",
    "direct @xmath90-body modelling of lmc - type clusters is now possible ",
    "@xcite present models with @xmath91 particles integrated over a hubble time of evolution . since we do observe asymmetries in the distribution of the two populations in ngc 1846",
    ", dynamical signatures offering clues to the formation process may also still be present outside the cluster centre .",
    "it would certainly be interesting ( although observationally challenging ) to investigate the internal dynamics of this object .",
    "@xmath90-body modelling would be helpful in this regard as it would allow the expected level of the signature to be predicted .",
    "ngc 1846 patently warrants further study , including improved photometry of the turn - off region , for important insights into star cluster formation processes .",
