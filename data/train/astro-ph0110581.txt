    "ngc 4038/9 (= arp 244 ) , aptly nicknamed `` the antennae '' , is one of the best - studied examples a galactic collision .",
    "the long tails which distinguish this system are emblematic of violent tidal interactions between disk galaxies of similar mass ( toomre & toomre 1972 , schweizer 1978 ) .",
    "tidal tails originate from the outer regions of galactic disks and are often rich in neutral atomic hydrogen .",
    "these features develop kinematically and their velocity fields bear the imprint of the encounter process , so they provide crucial information for dynamical modeling of interacting galaxies .",
    "we therefore targeted ngc  4038/9 for high - spatial and velocity resolution h@xmath0i  observations",
    "( full - width at half maximum , fwhm , as fine as @xmath7 5 km s@xmath8 ) in order to obtain the data needed to constrain future numerical simulations of this system .",
    "ngc 4038/9 was the first major merger to be mapped in the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the presence of significant quantities of neutral hydrogen within both the main bodies and the tails of ngc  4038/9 was established from single - dish measurements ( peterson & shostak 1974 , huchtmeier & bohnenstengel 1975 ) .",
    "subsequently , ngc 4038/9 has been the subject of h@xmath0i  synthesis mapping observations using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ; van der hulst 1979a ) , the very large array ( vla ; mahoney , burke & van der hulst 1987 ) and the australian telescope compact array ( atca ; gordon , koribalski & jones 2001 ) .",
    "the observations reported in this paper provide a more detailed mapping of the tidal features than afforded by previously published h@xmath0i",
    "maps , representing an improvement in spatial and velocity resolution by over a factor of two .",
    "other spectral line studies have mapped the kinematics of ngc 4038/9 using co spectral lines ( stanford et  al .",
    "1990 , wilson et  al .",
    "2000 , gao et  al .",
    "2001 , zhu 2001 ) and optical emission lines ( burbidge & burbidge 1966 , ruben , ford & dodorico 1970 , amram et  al .",
    "1992 ) . however , the molecular and ionized gas is confined to the inner disk regions , and their kinematics do not constrain the encounter geometry as well as that of the tidal tails .    at a heliocentric velocity of 1630 km",
    "s@xmath8  ( corresponding to a velocity relative to the local group of 1440 km s@xmath8 ) , the antennae is one of the nearest on - going major mergers . to be consistent with the majority of the recent work on ngc 4038/9",
    ", we derive physical quantities by adopting a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 , yielding a distance of 19.2 mpc .",
    "however , a recent analysis of @xmath9 @xmath10 photometry of individual stars within the southern tidal tail of ngc 4038/9 by saviane , rich & hibbard ( 2001 ) suggests a much smaller distance of 13.80.5 mpc .",
    "this distance is derived by identifying luminous red stars within the tail with the red giant branch of an old , metal poor population .",
    "there are some caveats to this derivation , for which we refer the reader to saviane et  al .",
    ", so for the purposes of the present work , we will use the more commonly accepted value of 19.2 mpc .    at this distance ,",
    "the tidal tails of ngc 4038/9 extend some 65 kpc in radius and measure @xmath11 kpc from end to end .",
    "the bodies of the galaxies are sites of extensive star formation , producing an ir luminosity of @xmath12 and an ir to blue luminosity ratio of @xmath13 .",
    "long - wavelength studies from the nir to radio suggest that this luminosity is powered by an active system - wide starburst , with no indication of a significant contribution by an agn ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 , vigroux et  al .",

    "2000 , xu et  al .",
    "2000 , neff & ulvestad 2000 , mengel et  al .",
    "while the ir luminosity is an order of magnitude lower than the most active star forming mergers ( the so - called ultraluminous infrared galaxies ) , it is still a factor of @xmath145 higher than non - interacting galaxy pairs ( e.g.  kennicutt et  al .",
    "1987 , bushouse 1987 , bushouse , lamb & werner 1988 ) , with an inferred star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath15 ( evans , harper & helou 1997 ; zhang , fall & whitmore 2001 ) .",
    "ngc 4038/9 is the nearest system with an identified dwarf - galaxy sized concentration of gas , light and young stars embedded within a luminous tidal tail ( schweizer 1978 , hereafter s78 ; mirabel , dottori , & lutz 1992 , hereafter mdl92 ) .",
    "such concentrations have been known for quite some time ( e.g.  zwicky 1956 ) , but have only recently received detailed attention .",
    "several numerical studies lend support to the hypothesis that such systems are self - gravitating and may evolve into independent dwarf galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1992 , elmegreen , kaufmann & thomasson 1993 ) , but the supporting observational evidence is primarily circumstantial .",
    "these observations show that the optical condensations within tidal tails contain many young stars ( s78 , mdl92 , hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky 1998 , weilbacher et  al .",
    "2000 , iglesias - p ' aramo & v ' ilchez 2001 , saviane , rich & hibbard 2001 ) and have global properties , such as size , luminosity , h@xmath0i  mass , h@xmath0ivelocity dispersion , and co content , in common with dwarf irregular galaxies ( mirabel et  al .",
    "1992 ; hibbard et  al .  1994 ; smith & higdon 1994 ; duc & mirabel 1994 , duc et  al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; smith & struck 2001 ; braine et  al .  2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "recently , some tidal dwarfs have even been found to harbor `` super star clusters '' ( knierman et  al .",
    "2001 ) . for these reasons",
    ", such concentrations are often referred to as `` tidal dwarf galaxies '' ( hereafter tdgs ) .",
    "however , strong kinematic evidence that these concentrations are indeed self - gravitating is lacking , and their evolution into dwarfs is therefore still in question ( see hibbard , barnes , & van der hulst 2001 , hereafter paper ii , for more details ) .",
    "another objective of the present observations is therefore to search for the kinematic signature of a self - gravitating mass in the vicinity of the putative tdg .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in ",
    "2 we present details on the observations and data reduction procedures . in ",
    "3 we describe in turn the morphology and kinematics of the tidal tails , sub - structure within the tails , the region in the vicinity of the tdg , the inner disks , and the companion galaxy . in  4 we try to explain various aspects of the h@xmath0i  tidal morphology , and look for evidence for a kinematically distinct entity at the end of the southern tail .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "the antennae was observed in two separate array configuration of the vla radio interferometer : the most compact configuration ( 1 km d - array ) in june of 1996 , and the hybrid cnb - array in june of 1997 . for the hybrid array , the antennae along the e and w arms of the array are at the standard c - array ( 3 km ) stations while those of the n arm are at the more extended b - array ( 9 km ) stations .",
    "this compensates for the foreshortening of baselines to the north arm antennae that occurs for sources at low declination .",
    "the short baselines of the d - array provide the highest sensitivity to extended gas , while the longer baselines of the cnb - array allow resolutions as fine as @xmath16 .",
    "ngc 4038/9 was observed for a total of 3.5 hours in the d - array and 8 hours in the cnb - array .",
    "the details of these observations are tabulated in table  [ tab : hiobs ] .",
    "we observed using the 21-cm spectral line mode with the system tuned to a central frequency corresponding to a heliocentric velocity of 1630 km s@xmath8 , the central velocity of the existing h@xmath0i   synthesis observations ( mahoney et  al .",
    "1987 ) . since the atomic gas within tidal tails typically has narrow linewidths ( @xmath17 510 km s@xmath8 ; hibbard et  al .",
    "1994 , hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) , the correlator mode was chosen to give the smallest channel spacing while still covering the velocity spread of existing h@xmath0i   observations ( 13601860 km s@xmath8 ; van der hulst 1979a , mahoney et  al .",
    "new broader - bandwidth h@xmath0i  ( gordon et  al .",
    "2001 ) and co ( gao et  al .",
    "2001 ) observations reveal that there is both atomic and molecular gas over the velocity range from 13401945 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result below .    using on - line hanning smoothing ,",
    "the chosen set - up provides 127 independent velocity channels over the 3.125 mhz bandwidth , resulting in a channel spacing of 5.21 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the pointing center was chosen to place the ends of the optical tails at equal distances from the phase center .",
    "this position is @xmath18 south of the main bodies , and places the ends of the optical tails at a radius of @xmath19 , which is approximately the 75% sensitivity point of the primary beam ( see figure [ fig : hidss ] ) .",
    "the data were calibrated , mapped , and  cleaned \" using standard techniques and procedures in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) ( see e.g.  rupen 1999 ) .",
    "the data from the separate arrays were calibrated and bandpass corrected independently , after which they were combined in the uv plane to produce the c+d dataset .",
    "this latter dataset is used exclusively throughout this paper .",
    "the final calibration of this dataset was achieved by three iterations of a phase - only self - calibration .",
    "the resulting continuum map is very similar to others that have appeared in the literature ( e.g. hummel & van der hulst 1986 ; neff & ulvestad 2000 , gordon et  al .",
    "2001 ) , and is not shown here .",
    "the continuum was subtracted from the velocity cube by fitting a first - order polynomial to the visibilities from the line free channels on either end of the bandpass .",
    "this is done in an iterative manner in order to determine which channels are free of line emission .",
    "the resulting fit was made using channels 1120 and 104111 of the 127 channel cube , corresponding to the velocities 18591911 km s@xmath8  and 13861423 km s@xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned above , cold gas has been found within both of these velocity ranges by gordon et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and gao et  al.(2001 ) .",
    "the gas at these velocities is of low surface brightness and totally confined to either the disk of ngc 4039 or the disk overlap region .",
    "therefore , using this continuum range will not affect any of the measured properties of the tidal tails , which is our primary interest in this paper .",
    "however , the h@xmath0i  flux we measure for the central region will underestimate the true flux , and the kinematics of this region will not be accurately mapped ( although the fact that the line kinematics are weighted by intensity will somewhat mitigate the effects of the missing velocity information ) .",
    "the continuum subtracted data were mapped using several values of the robust weighting parameter , @xmath20 ( briggs 1995 ) .",
    "this parameter can be varied to emphasize either the outer ( @xmath21 ) or the inner ( @xmath22 ) regions of the uv plane ( i.e. , either small or large spatial scales ) . in practical terms",
    ", a lower @xmath20 gives a finer spatial resolution at the expense of surface brightness sensitivity , while a larger @xmath20 gives a higher surface brightness sensitivity at a slightly coarser spatial resolution .",
    "a high resolution data cube was made with @xmath23 , providing a surface brightness rms sensitivity of 1.3 mjy beam@xmath8 at a resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "this corresponds to a single channel column density limit ( 2.5@xmath25 per channel ) of 2.2 averaged over the beam width of 1.1@xmath260.7 kpc@xmath27 .",
    "a more sensitive intermediate resolution data cube , made with @xmath28 , provides a resolution of @xmath29 ( 1.9@xmath261.4 kpc@xmath27 ) and a column density limit of 4 . to further increase sensitivity to extended low column density gas ,",
    "a low resolution data cube was made by convolving the @xmath28 data cube to a resolution of @xmath30 ( 3.7 kpc ) , reaching a detection limit of 1.2 .",
    "these data will be referred to in the following as the high , intermediate , and low resolution data , respectively .",
    "these parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : hiobs ] .",
    "the resulting per channel noise is close to theoretical once the higher system temperature due to the low declination of the source is taken into consideration .",
    "visualization of the resulting data cubes and inter - comparison with the optical and nir data was greatly facilitated by using the karma visualization package ( gooch 1995 ) .",
    "besides allowing multiple images to be interactively compared , this package also allows a full 3-dimensional rendering of datacubes , which is a particularly powerful tool for disturbed systems .    after a careful viewing ,",
    "the data cubes were integrated over the velocity axis to produce the moment maps . in order to suppress the effects of noise ,",
    "only data above a fixed threshold are used in the moment summation ( the `` cutoff technique '' described by bosma , 1981 ) using the aips task momnt .",
    "this task applies a user specified threshold to a version of the data cube smoothed in both space and velocity .",
    "if a pixel in the smoothed data cube passes the threshold , the corresponding pixel in the un - smoothed data is included in the moment analysis .",
    "this procedure favors low level emission that is extended in velocity and/or space over emission which is isolated .",
    "the output from this analysis is an integrated intensity map ( zeroth moment ) , an intensity - weighted velocity map ( first moment ) , and an intensity - weighted velocity dispersion map ( second moment ) .",
    "it should be noted that the first and second moment maps give an accurate representation of the mean h@xmath0i   velocity and line - of - sight velocity dispersion at a location only if the line profiles are single - peaked .",
    "the final zeroth moment maps were corrected for the primary beam attenuation before measuring h@xmath0i   fluxes .",
    "we measure h@xmath0i  fluxes from an integrated intensity map constructed to match the new atca h@xmath0i  observations of gordon et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , since those authors were able to do a proper line - free continuum subtraction . for the moment analysis ,",
    "this involved applying a threshold of 2.1 mjy beam@xmath8 to the data after smoothing with a 3@xmath263 pixel boxcar spatial filter and a five - channel hanning filter .",
    "our resulting flux measurements are given in table  [ tab : global ] .",
    "the errors attached to the flux measurements have been determined from the single channel noise by properly taking into account the number of independent channels and beams over which the flux was integrated .",
    "it should be noted that the error calculation does not include systematic errors , such as those introduced by poor continuum subtraction or incomplete cleaning .",
    "the supporting optical observations were obtained during two nights of broad - band @xmath31 imaging on the ctio 0.9 m with the tek512 ccd in april of 1991 and one night of near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath32-band imaging on the uh @xmath33 with the quirc detector in january of 1995 .",

    "the data were calibrated via observations of standards in the graham e - regions ( graham 1982 ) observed on the same nights , with zeropoint errors ( 1@xmath25 ) of 0.04@xmath37  in @xmath38 and 0.02@xmath37  in both @xmath39 and @xmath20 . for the nir run",

    "the seeing was @xmath34 .",
    "these observations consist of three 120 sec target - sky pairs , with the ccd dithered by 15 between on - source positions .",
    "the nir data are uncalibrated .",
    "the combined images were transformed to the world coordinate system ( and thereby to the same reference frame as the radio images ) by registering to an image of the same area extracted from the digitized sky survey  ( dss ) .",
    "the registration was accomplished by referencing the location of @xmath14 20 stars in common on both images using the koords program in the karma package ( gooch 1995 ) to perform a non - linear least squares fit for the transformation equations .",
    "the plate solution so found is accurate to a fraction of a pixel , and the overall registration should be as good as that of the southern portion of the guide star catalog , which is estimated to be @xmath44 ( taff et  al.1990 ) .",
    "deep optical images were constructed by applying a 9@xmath269 pixel boxcar median to the pixels with the lowest light levels , achieving limiting surface brightnesses of @xmath45=27.0 mag arcsec@xmath46   and @xmath47=26.5 mag arcsec@xmath46 .",
    "color maps in @xmath48 and @xmath49 were made after convolving the images to a common resolution , and using only pixels with a signal - to - noise greater than five in both bands .",
    "these maps will be shown here , but a full color analysis is deferred to a later paper ( evans et  al . , in prep . ) .",
    "finally , a smoothed @xmath38-band image was made by replacing stars with background values and convolving to the resolution of the intermediate resolution h@xmath0i   data .",
    "this image is used to evaluate the h@xmath0i   mass to blue light ratio ( @xmath50 ) of various regions .",
    "the large scale distribution of the h@xmath0i   is shown in figure [ fig : hidss ] , where the left panel shows the low resolution h@xmath0i   contoured upon the dss image , while the right panel shows the intermediate resolution h@xmath0i  in greyscales with contours from the smoothed @xmath38-band superimposed .",
    "our new observations delineate the distribution of tidal h@xmath0i  much more clearly than earlier h@xmath0iobservations , showing that the gas in the northern tail extends further than previously known , and revealing a small h@xmath0i - rich disk companion to the antennae lying just beyond the southern tail .",
    "these results are confirmed by the atca observations by gordon et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) . using the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) ,",
    "this latter object is identified with the galaxy eso 572g045 .",
    "we break the h@xmath0i  emission into four separate components : the southern tail , the northern tail , the inner disks , and the new dwarf companion eso 572g045 .",
    "the h@xmath0i  properties of each of these components are listed in table  [ tab : global ] .",
    "the large scale distribution and kinematics of the h@xmath0i   derived from the intermediate resolution data are shown in figure [ fig : allmos ] .",

    "finally , the lower right panel shows a color representation of the h@xmath0i   velocity dispersion , again with h@xmath0i   column density contours superimposed .",
    "as revealed by the wsrt observations of van der hulst ( 1979a ) , the majority of the h@xmath0i  is associated with ngc 4038 and the southern tail , with much less gas directly associated with ngc 4039 and the northern tail .",
    "we detect tidal h@xmath0i  emission over a velocity range of 1420  1850 km s@xmath8 , similar to that found in the synthesis observations of mahoney et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) , but less than found in the broader bandwidth observations of gordon et  al .",
    "we measure a total h@xmath0i  flux of at least 54.50.5 jy km s@xmath8  for ngc 4038/9 , corresponding to a h@xmath0i  mass of @xmath514.7 ( table  [ tab : global ] ) .",
    "this is not very different from the total flux measurement of 57.1 jy km s@xmath8  measured at the atca by gordon et  al .",

    "s@xmath8  measured by gordon et  al .. examining the channel maps of gordon et  al .",
    ", we find a mean flux level of @xmath14 10 mjy beam@xmath8 ( for a 40@xmath52 beam ) over the velocity range which we used for continuum subtraction .",
    "this suggest that , due to our improper continuum subtraction , we miss a total of 6 jy km s@xmath8  over the entire 600 km s@xmath8  velocity range mapped by gordon et  al . , which explains the different disk flux measurements .",
    "we also find differences for the northern tail and companion galaxy , where we recover over twice the flux found by gordon et  al ..",
    "we next present details of the observations for each of the components individually , as well as for the tidal dwarf candidate(s ) within the southern tail .      the majority of the the tidal gas is associated with the southern tail .",
    "this tail extends to a projected radius of @xmath53 ( 65 kpc ) , and contains 2.8 of h@xmath0i  along its entire length .",
    "the column density slowly decreases with increasing distance along the tail , reaches a minimum , and increases again near its end .",
    "perpendicular to the tail , the gas is distributed more broadly than the optical light , with a notable extension running along the outer ( southern ) edge of the tail .",
    "there is no optical counterpart to this outer extension at our limiting surface brightness of @xmath54 27 mag arcsec@xmath46  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hidss ] ) , with a resulting h@xmath0i  gas - to - light ratio of @xmath50@xmath51 1.5 @xmath55 , compared to @xmath140.5 @xmath55  on the optical tail .",
    "the gas within the southern tail shows considerable structure on the scale of one beamwidth ( @xmath14 12 kpc ) .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure [ fig : posvel ] , which displays three orthogonal projections of the intermediate resolution h@xmath0i   datacube .",
    "the upper left panel shows the sky view , @xmath56 , and to either side of this are the two orthogonal position - velocity profiles , @xmath57 ( bottom ) and @xmath58 ( right ) .",
    "the @xmath59 view is displayed using a `` maximum voxel '' function .",
    "this function assigns to each pixel the maximum intensity found along the velocity axis .",
    "the position - velocity plots are constructed in the more traditional manner , summing the emission along one of the spatial dimensions of the datacube , either right ascension or declination .",
    "we will use these plots below when examining the tail kinematics (  [ sec : tailkin ] )    the maximum voxel display emphasizes regions where the h@xmath0i   is cold and dense ( maximum number of h@xmath0i   atoms per unit velocity ) . as a result , it emphasizes the dynamically cold tidal tails .",
    "note especially how the disk h@xmath0i , which has the highest integrated h@xmath0icolumn density , appears fainter in fig .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] than in the zeroth moment maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hidss ] ) .",
    "this is because the disk gas is spread over a very broad range of velocities .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] reveals a number of dense knots within the southern tail , especially toward its end .",
    "the maximum voxel display ensures that this is not due to a line - of - sight integration effect where the tail bends back along our line - of - sight .",
    "notice also that similar dense knots are not found within the northern tail .",
    "the southern tail also exhibits an interesting parallel or `` bifurcated '' structure that starts where the southern tail begins to bend westward , and joins back together just before the location of the star forming regions identified by mirabel et  al .",

    "the inner ( northern ) filament projects onto the optical tail and has a higher characteristic column density .      the low resolution moment map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hidss ] ) shows that the northern h@xmath0i   tail extends beyond the end of the optical tail , to a projected radius of 73 ( 40 kpc ) from the center of ngc 4039 .",
    "this extension is confirmed by the atca observations of gordon et  al .",
    "we detect a total of 4.2 of h@xmath0i   associated with the northern tail , which is much more than found in any of the previous observations .",
    "the northern tail is redder ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allmos]b ) , less luminous , and has a lower relative h@xmath0icontent than the southern tail ( table  [ tab : global ] ) .",
    "we also notice that the gas in the northern tail is relegated to the outer half of the optical tail and in a purely gaseous extension beyond this . in particular , there is a distinct gap in the h@xmath0idistribution from a projected radius of 25 kpc back to where the tail connects onto ngc 4039 .",
    "the difference in the h@xmath0i   content of the tails appears to be mirrored in the quantities of h@xmath0i   within the disks associated with either tail ( with ngc 4038 being gas rich and ngc 4039 being gas poor ; see  [ sec : disk ] below ) .",
    "these differences and the lack of h@xmath0i   at the base of the northern tail were already noted by van der hulst ( 1979a ) , who attributed them to a difference in the h@xmath0i   content of the parent galaxies .",
    "we will return to this point in  [ sec : ionize ]      velocities along the northern tail show a regular gradient from 1610 km s@xmath8   at the base of the h@xmath0i   to 1540 km s@xmath8   at the end of optical tail , while the velocities along the southern tail range from 1590 , where the tail connects onto the northern disk , to a peak of 1770 km s@xmath8   midway along the tail , declining to 1610 km s@xmath8   toward the tip .",
    "this kinematic continuity is convincingly illustrated in the position - velocity plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] , which also demonstrates that the tidal gas is quite dynamically cold . the smooth run of velocities along the tails is already apparent from the westerbork data of van der hulst ( 1979a ) , and is expected from tidal interaction models ( e.g. barnes 1988 , hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "the well - behaved kinematics enable us to infer the approximate tail geometry .",
    "for example , along the southern tail the h@xmath0i  column density is lowest at the regions of the most extreme redshift , and increases to either side of this .",
    "this indicates that this region of the tail lies perpendicular to our line - of - sight , with its motion directed most nearly toward us . at this location ,",
    "the tail has a minimum projected thickness and hence lowest h@xmath0i  column density .",
    "to either side of this the tail curves toward our line - of - sight , resulting in a larger pathlength through the gas - rich tidal material and hence a higher projected column density .",
    "the sharper velocity gradients to either side reflect the slewing of the velocity vectors as the tail bends away from us .",
    "similarly , the sharp up - turn at the end of the southern tail in both space and velocity suggests that this region curves away from us . we will address the implications of this geometry for any embedded tidal dwarf galaxy in  [ sec : tdg ]",
    "since tails are kinematically expanding structures ( toomre & toomre 1972 , barnes 1988 ) , the relative velocities of the two tails indicate that the southern tail is moving away from us and connects back to ngc 4038 from behind while the northern tail is swinging slightly toward us and connects back to ngc 4039 from the front .",
    "this geometry is supported by the lack of a dust absorption feature associated with the southern tail as it crosses from the south back to ngc 4038 .",
    "in fact , the optical colors of these regions are quite blue ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allmos]b ) , whereas we would expect red colors from dust absorption if this gas - rich material lies between us and the disk . as shown directly by van der",
    "hulst ( 1979a ) , these kinematics are consistent with the prograde spin geometry derived by the early numerical models of this system by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ; see also barnes 1988 ; mihos , bothun & richstone 1993 ) .",
    "following the southern tail kinematics back to its progenitor disk ( ngc 4038 , to the north ) , we see that the velocities become blueshifted toward the base of the tail ( fig .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] ) .",
    "since the predominantly redshifted velocities of the tail constrain it to be swinging away from us and connect back to the disk of ngc 4038 from behind , the blueshifted velocities at the base indicate material that is streaming back toward the disk from the tidal tail ( hibbard et  al .",
    "such streaming is a natural consequence of such encounters ( e.g. barnes 1988 , hernquist & spergel 1992 , hibbard & mihos 1995 ) , and arises because the tail material at smaller radii is more tightly bound than material further out . as a result , this material reaches its orbital apocenter more quickly and subsequently falls back toward the inner regions .",
    "we can use the maximum projected tail length of 65 kpc and the disk rotation speed inferred from the fabry - perot observations of amram et  al .",
    "1992 ( 155 km s@xmath8 , corrected for disk inclination ) , to infer an interaction age ( measured from orbital periapse , when the tails were launched ) of 420 myr .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the best - match time of 450 myr from the numerical model of ngc 4038/9 run by barnes ( 1988 ) .",
    "it is also remarkably close to the age of the population of 500 myr old globular clusters found by whitmore et  al.(1999 ; see also fritze-v.alvensleben 1998 ) , supporting the hypothesis that this gc population formed around the time when the tails were first ejected ( whitmore et  al .",
    "1999 ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : allmos]d we note that the velocity dispersion within the tidal tails is actually quite low : except for the base of the southern tail , the h@xmath0i  dispersion is less than 16 km s@xmath8 , and the mean of 7 km s@xmath8  is typical of values measured in undisturbed disk galaxies .",
    "this is true of long - tailed mergers in general ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 , hibbard & yun 1999a ) .",
    "the dispersion near the base of the southern tail has higher characteristic values of 1325 km s@xmath8 .",
    "these regions likely lie along a steeper gradient in the potential , and are also regions where the line - of - sight velocities are changing rapidly ( fig .",

    "the improved resolution of the vla observations allows us to directly address the behavior of the atomic gas in the vicinity of the putative tidal dwarf galaxy(s ) identified near the end of the southern tail of the antennae .",

    "the end of the tail was subsequently studied by mirabel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who concentrated on what they called a `` detached condensation of gas and stars at the tip of a tidal tail '' , consisting of a twisted stellar bar embedded in an envelope of diffuse optical emission and containing three emission line complexes .",

    "while all subsequent observers have referred to the region identified by mdl92 when discussing the putative tdg , we will address the dynamical nature of both of these regions .",
    "this is not a trivial task , as the precise boundaries of the tdg candidates have never been explicitly defined .",
    "our h@xmath0i  observations ( as well as those by mahoney et  al .",
    "1987 and gordon et  al .",
    "2001 ) are a vast improvement on the observations of van der hulst ( 1979 ) , and show that the tail is a continuous kinematic structure .",
    "specifically , there is no `` detached '' region which can readily be identified as a distinct entity .",
    "further , the velocity field varies smoothly through the region containing the high gas column densities and star forming regions without a significant twist or kink .",
    "the strongest velocity gradient corresponds with the region where the tail turns abruptly to the north ( compressed contours near the center of the map in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdgmos]c , with a similar gradient just to the east of this ) .",
    "this smooth gradient suggests that the velocity field in this region is dominated by projection effects , with the tail bending away from us back into the plane of the sky ; as a result the velocity vector slews from pointing toward us to pointing away from us .",
    "therefore , we find no clear kinematic evidence in the velocity field for any dynamically distinct entities .",
    "it is possible that the strong tidal gradient may mask the kinematic signature of any mass concentration .    since there are no well defined boundaries to the dwarf candidates , we calculate the h@xmath0i  mass and blue luminosity in their vicinity by summing the emission within successive circular apertures centered on the local h@xmath0i  column density peaks .",
    "the maximum aperture radius is set by the half - width of the tail",
    ". a mean background is subtracted , and the h@xmath0i  flux is summed within each aperture of radius @xmath20 .",
    "the optical luminosity is measured from the smoothed star - subtracted @xmath38-band within the same apertures .",

    "[ tab : tdg ] we list the total h@xmath0i  mass and optical luminosity measured by these curves for each dwarf candidate , but since there are no distinct boundaries for either region , these values should be considered very rough guides .",
    "the strong velocity gradients mentioned above give rise to the regions with the highest h@xmath0i  velocity dispersions in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdgmos]d , as gas with different space velocities fall within the same beam . aside from these regions , there are other local peaks in the gas velocity dispersion which might provide possible evidence for a mass concentration : between regions i & ii and region iii the h@xmath0i  velocity dispersion increases to @xmath1412 km s@xmath8  vs. an average of 67 km s@xmath8  along the tail .",
    "similar signatures are seen at the location of tidal dwarf candidates within the optical tails of the merger remnants ngc 7252 ( hibbard et  al .",
    "1994 ) and ngc 3921 ( hibbard & van gorkom 1993 , 1996 ) . however , it is noteworthy that the three h@xmath0iiregions actually fall on the edges of h@xmath0i  maxima .",
    "similar signatures are seen near giant h@xmath0ii  regions in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. stewart et  al.2000 , walter & brinks 1999 ) , where the increased h@xmath0i  linewidth is due instead to kinetic agitation of the gas from energy deposited by young stars , sne and stellar winds ( e.g. stewart et  al .",
    "2000 , yang et  al.1996 , tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 and references therein ) rather than the gravitational effects of a mass concentration .",
    "there is also an increased dispersion to the north of tdg [ s78 ] ( dispersion increases to 15.6 km s@xmath8  over the surrounding value of 11 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "however , an examination of the line profiles shows that the increased dispersion comes from low - level emission spread over many channels .",
    "adjacent regions have this broad low - level component , but also have a brighter narrower component which leads to a lower intensity - weighted line - width .",
    "so we do not believe that this is a signature of a mass concentration at this location .    since the moment maps are susceptible to line - of - sight integration effects , we turn to the velocity cubes directly for further insight . from the channel maps , we find that the gas near the tdg obtains the highest gaseous phase - space densities in this system ( i.e.  density enhancements localized in space and velocity ) .",
    "in fact , this region has a higher h@xmath0i  column density per unit km s@xmath8  than any other region in this system , including regions within the disk or overlap region ( see also fig .  [",

    "such concentrations suggest regions of gaseous dissipation .",
    "while this is not unequivocal evidence of a self - gravitating dwarf - sized object , since increased gaseous dissipation is expected in regions of recent star formation , it does indicate that there is something unique about this region of the tail .",
    "the channel maps also show the bifurcated structure mentioned in  [ sec : stail ] .",
    "it is very interesting that the two parallel filaments join just east of the location of the star forming regions associated with the tdg ( the  v \"- shaped feature seen in the panel at 1734 km s@xmath8  of fig .",
    "[ fig : tdgchan ] ) .",
    "again , these observations suggest that there is something special about the gas and tail geometry at the location of the star forming regions .",
    "the parallel filaments can be seen separately in the channels from v=17551724 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the northern filament quite clearly lies along the optical tail , while the southern filament is displaced by about 8 kpc to the south .",
    "the density peaks are of similar magnitude in either filament , but only at the location of the putative tdg is there a corresponding increase seen in the optical light underlying the gas peaks .",

    "( 2000 ) is that the starburst has cleared enough dust and gas from the inner regions to provide direct unobscured sightlines to the tails . by equating the surface ionization rate with the recombination rate , they find that the gas should be ionized out to a distance given by :    @xmath74    where @xmath65 and @xmath75 are the column density and thickness of the h@xmath0ilayer being ionized , @xmath76 is the fraction of ionized photons emerging from the starburst , and we have made the standard assumption that most of the starburst luminosity is emitted in the far infrared ( see hibbard et  al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "the fiducial values used in eqn .  [ eq : rion ] are appropriate for ngc  4038/9 , and we thus find that the starburst may well be capable of ionizing gas out to the h@xmath0i  base of the northern tail ( 25 kpc projected radius ) , providing the tail has a clear sightline to the ionizing stars and that @xmath76 is not much smaller than 0.05 .",
    "evidence that @xmath76 is at least as large as this is provided by numerical work by dove , shull & ferrara ( 2000 ) , who derive @xmath77 for normal galaxies , and suggest that starbursts should have significantly higher values .",
    "hurwitz , jelinsky , & dixon ( 1997 ) find upper limits to the escape fraction of @xmath78 photons of 357% for four ir luminous starbursts , while bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999 ) calculate @xmath79 for the milky way ( see discussion in bland - hawthorn & putman 2001 ) .",
    "so the question becomes , is it likely that the northern tail of ngc 4039 has a relatively clear view of the star - forming disk , while the southern tail does not ? we believe the answer to this question is yes .",
    "the majority of the unobscured massive star forming regions in ngc 4038/9 are associated with the disk of ngc 4038 and the material along the bridge ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 , whitmore et  al .",
    "since tidal tails are spun off close to the spin plane of the progenitor ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) , the southern tail will not have a clear view to the star forming regions located within the disk ngc 4038 , and the body of ngc 4039 would block ionization originating from the bridge star forming regions .",
    "the body of ngc 4039 , on the other hand , appears to have a perfect view of the star forming disk of ngc 4038 and the northern tail should have a view to the backside of this disk .",
    "this prediction can be tested by numerical models to constrain the space geometry of the tail .",
    "we suggest that ngc 4039 had a normal h@xmath0i   distribution , but that much of this gas has been photoionized by the starburst .",
    "we believe a similar effect is responsible for the lack of h@xmath0i   at smaller radii in the otherwise gas - rich tidal tails of the ngc 7252 , arp 105 , and arp 299 systems ( hibbard , vacca & yun 2000 ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the ionized gas should be visible via its recombination radiation .",
    "using the equation given in hibbard et",
    "al.(2000 ) , the expected emission measure of this radiation should be @xmath80 for a gas column density of 2 and thickness of 5 kpc .",
    "this is within the capabilities of modern ccd detectors ( e.g.   donahue et  al .",
    "1995 ; hoopes , walterbos & rand 1999 ) .      as mentioned above",
    ", tails are two dimensional  ribbons \" twisting through space .",
    "it is possible that a lateral twist may cause the outer edge of the ribbon to lie in a different plane from the inner regions , i.e.  for the most gas - rich ( highest @xmath50 ) regions to appear in a different plane from the less gas - rich but optically brighter regions ( mihos 2001 ) . in hibbard & yun ( 1999a )",
    "we suggest that this this effect may be exacerbated by a pre - existing warp in the progenitor disk , providing even more marked offsets .",
    "this provides a simple explanation for the gas - rich but optically faint outer edge of the southern tail .",
    "similar bifurcated tails are seen in several systems ( e.g.  m81 , van der hulst 1979b , yun et  al .   1994 ; ngc 3921 , hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ; ngc 2535/6 , kaufman et  al .",
    "1997 ; arp 299 hibbard & yun 1999a ) .",
    "what is intriguing is that the two filaments appear to join back together just at the location of the star forming regions associated with the candidate tidal dwarf tdg [ mdl92 ] ( the `` v''-shape seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : greychan ] & [ fig : tdgchan ] and discussed in ",
    "[ sec : stail ] &  [ sec : tdg ] ) .",
    "we do not know whether this is a coincidence or an important clue .",
    "further insight into this question will have to await a more detailed numerical study of this system .",
    "we wish to take advantage of the higher spatial and velocity resolution of our h@xmath0i  observations to examine the dynamical nature of material in the vicinity of the tdg candidates .",
    "this is a difficult task , since there are no distinct objects which can be defined unambiguously .",
    "further , if there are objects within the tail , they are clearly not in isolation , and the kinematics may not be due to the local mass concentration .",
    "all of these factors make a clear dynamical analysis fraught with uncertainties .",
    "still , the present data are the best available , in terms of both spatial and kinematic resolution , and this is the nearest system with a candidate tidal dwarf , so we will proceed with all due caution .    the first hypothesis we will test is whether there are concentrations of gas and light centered on the gas peaks with enough mass in luminous matter alone to account for the measured h@xmath0i  line - width . to this end , we compare the virial mass inferred from the h@xmath0i  linewidth ( @xmath81 ) to the total luminous mass inferred from the h@xmath0i  flux and the optical luminosity ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath83 is sufficient for a region to be bound , while a value of @xmath84 is required for the region to be virialized .    to calculate the virial mass",
    ", we must make some assumptions about the 3-dimensional structure of any mass concentration .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that there is an isotropic spherical mass concentration of constant density .",
    "for this situation , the virial mass is given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the gravitational constant , @xmath25 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath87 is the projected half - light radius , and @xmath88 is a geometric factor ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath89 for the adopted geometry .",
    "we take the velocity dispersion at the location of the peak column density , and use the deconvolved half - light radius found from fitting a gaussian plus constant background to the h@xmath0imass distribution .",
    "the luminous mass is calculated from the observed mass and optical luminosity following the prescription given in paper ii .",
    "in particular , the possible contribution to the luminous mass by stars is estimated by adopting a range of stellar mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath90 ) representing different star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "the gas mass is derived from the h@xmath0i  mass by multiplying by a factor of 1.36 to take into account a primordial abundance of helium .",
    "no correction is made for the presence of molecular gas since recent co observations at the location of the tdg by gao et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and braine et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) find only trace amounts of molecular gas in the vicinity of the tidal dwarf ( 4 ) .",
    "we evaluate three different stellar mass - to - light ratios , which span a range of star formation histories .",
    "we evaluate @xmath91 0 @xmath55(i.e . ,",
    "@xmath92 , also appropriate for a young instantaneous burst ) ; @xmath91 2 @xmath55 , corresponding to a constant sfh at an age of 10 gyr , and @xmath91 5 @xmath55 , representing an exponentially decreasing sfh with a time constant of 4 gyr at an age of 10 gyr ( see paper ii for more details ) .",
    "the results of the luminous to virial mass calculation are given in table  [ tab : tdg ] .",
    "the ratios of the luminous to virial mass given in table  [ tab : tdg ] are less than one , suggesting that neither mass concentration is virialized .",
    "however , they do not rule out the presence of a bound object .",
    "they do imply that there is not a sufficient gas density for the regions to be bound by gas alone ( i.e. , @xmath93 for @xmath91 0 @xmath55 ) .",
    "this contradicts the conclusion reached for this same region by braine et  al .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that braine et  al .",
    "use the much narrow co linewidth to calculate a dynamical mass , yet include both h@xmath0i  and stellar light in their luminous mass calculation ( as mentioned above , the mass in molecular mass inferred from the co line flux is negligible compared to the h@xmath0i ) .",
    "the fact that the h@xmath0i  linewidth is much broader than the co linewidth argues that a much larger mass concentration is required to bind it , and the braine analysis is inappropriate .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail in paper ii .",
    "a further conclusion from the above analysis is that if the dwarf candidates _ are _ bound , they require a significant contribution to the total mass from evolved stars , or they are bound by dark matter . in this case , the calculated values of @xmath94 are valid _ only _ if the h@xmath0i  line - width also characterizes the motion of the stars ( and/or dark matter ) .",
    "this is probably not the case , since in normal disks the older stellar populations ( i.e. , those with higher @xmath95 ratios ) have a significantly higher dispersion than the gas , by factors of 23 ( van der kruit 1988 ) , which would lead to a virial mass estimate a factor of 410 higher and @xmath94 ratios correspondingly smaller .",
    "young stellar populations have a velocity dispersions similar to the cold gas , but also have smaller @xmath95 ratios .",
    "a measurement of the stellar kinematics and a better estimate of the stellar mass - to - light ratio is needed to be more conclusive .",
    "finally , we note that the expected circular velocity given by @xmath96 is 2030 km s@xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : tdgmos]c shows no sign of rotation at this level .",
    "we conclude that either tdg candidate may be , but need not be , self - gravitating .",
    "this virial analysis includes many caveats .",
    "primarily , the above analysis implies that we know the ratio @xmath94 to within a factor of two , and in truth we do not know either quantity to this precision . further , unless the bound regions are much smaller than the width of the tail , the geometry is unlikely to be spherical , and the velocities are unlikely to be isotropic .",
    "finally , any entrained objects are clearly not in isolation , complicating the virial analysis .",
    "we will be addressing these uncertainties using simulated observations of bound objects within n - body tails ( kohring , hibbard & barnes , in preparation ) .",
    "the above analysis depends on a specific geometry and the details of the gaussian fit to the gas distribution . a more common but even less clear analysis uses a dynamical mass indicator @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the fwhm linewidth ,",
    "@xmath20 is a radius , and @xmath86 is the gravitational constant ( e.g. braine et  al .",
    "this quantity has the dimensions of mass , but it is not obvious what mass it defines , especially when the radius used is not physically motivated .",
    "however , we can use the quantity to see how taking larger or smaller region in the vicinity of either dwarf candidate might affect our conclusions . specifically ,",
    "we evaluate how the ratio of the luminous mass to this dynamical mass indicator changes with radius using the circular apertures defined in  [ sec : tdg ] and the light curves given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumiring ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath98 is 2.35 times the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath20 is the deconvolved aperture radius .",
    "the luminous mass is calculated from the h@xmath0i  mass and optical luminosity as above .",
    "the results of this exercise is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlummdyn ] .",
    "three curves are drawn , each one representing a different stellar mass - to - light ratio : the solid curve shows the result for @xmath99 @xmath55 , the dotted curve shows the results for @xmath100 @xmath55 , and the dashed line shows the results for @xmath101 @xmath55 .",
    "we see that this ratio decreases with larger apertures .",
    "therefore , taking a larger radius will not change the conclusions reached above .",
    "taking a smaller radius might turn up objects with a larger luminous to dynamical mass , but in this case they would have a much smaller mass scale than is usually assumed .    in conclusion",
    ", we find no kinematic signature of a distinct dynamical entity within the southern tail , but any signature might be masked by the strong geometric velocity gradients in this region . if there are bound mass concentrations , they require a significant contribution from either evolved stars or dark matter to bind them .    if the lower distance of 13.8 mpc suggested by saviane et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) is correct , then the luminous mass decreases by a factor of 2 while the virial mass decreases by a factor of 1.4 , so the luminous to virial mass estimates all decrease by a factor of 1.4 , making it less likely that either tdg candidate is a bound object .",
    "additionally , if there are bound regions , the mass scale would be more typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies than dwarf irregulars , and the gaseous concentrations may have more relevance to remnant streams around galaxies than the formation of dwarf irregulars ( kroupa 1998 ) .    if there are dwarf - galaxy sized concentrations forming within the tail , then the present observations appear inconsistent with the tidal dwarf formation scenario suggested by elmegreen , kaufmann & thomasson ( 1992 ) . in their scenario",
    "the velocity dispersion of tidal gas is increased over the pre - encounter value due to the interaction , increasing the jeans mass in the tidal gas and leading to the formation of dwarf irr sized objects . as noted in  [ sec : tailkin ] , the velocity dispersion within the tidal tails of ngc 4038/9 is typical of values measured in undisturbed disk galaxies .",
    "this is true of long - tailed mergers in general ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 , hibbard & yun 1999a ) and agrees with the expectation from numerical models . the tails form from the dynamically coldest material on the side of the disk opposite orbital periapses , and expand kinematically thereafter .",
    "tails , particularly those of low - inclination prograde encounters , should not and appear not to be significantly kinematically heated by the encounter . and",
    "while it is true that an increased velocity dispersion will suppress the formation of low mass objects , it does not follow that it should lead to the collapse of higher mass objects ; it simply means that a higher mass is required in order for the concentration to collapse .",
    "therefore , the model of tidal dwarf formation suggested by elmegreen , kaufmann & thomasson ( 1992 ) does not appear to apply here .",
    "a last point that we wish to make is that ngc 4038/9 is clearly an on - going merger experiencing a massive young starburst which is spread throughout the disk of ngc 4038 and the overlap region . and",
    "yet , the long tails of ngc 4038/9 suggest that the interaction began in earnest of order 400 myr previously .",
    "this is very similar to the situation in the infrared luminous merger arp 299 ( hibbard & yun 1999a ) .",
    "additionally , the proximity of ngc 4038/9 have allowed the identification of a population of sscs with ages of @xmath14 500 myr ( whitmore et  al .",
    "1999 ) spread throughout the disk region .",
    "clearly , then , merger induced extra - nuclear star - formation began around the time that the tails were launched , has continued until today , and will likely continue until the merger is complete . therefore , the merger induced ",
    "burst \" population will be broadly spread throughout the remnant , both spatially and temporarily .",
    "while a significant amount of the present gas supply may find its way into the innermost regions of the remnant , it is not clear how much of this gas will be converted into stars .",
    "much of this gas may be expelled in starburst driven superwind ( heckman et  al .  1999 ,",
    "hibbard & yun 1999b ) .    either way",
    ", the expected signature of the evolved merger remnant will not be as pronounced as is often assumed ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994 , bekki & shioya 1997 , silva & bothun 1998a , b ) . instead of a single epoch",
    "metal - enriched population confined to the innermost radii of the remnant and surrounded by a uniformly - old metal poor population , there will be stars with an age range of @xmath14 1 gyr spread throughout remnant body , with perhaps an inner population of stars formed from whatever gas is not blown out .",
    "* we have mapped the h@xmath0i   in the classical double - tailed merger , ngc 4038/9 , `` the antennae '' , with unprecedented spatial and velocity resolution . in agreement with other observers ( van der hulst 1979a , mahoney et  al .",
    "1987 , gordon et  al .",
    "2001 ) , we find the northern tail to be gas - rich at its tip but gas - poor at its base , the southern tail to be gas rich along its entire length and with a significant enhancement in the gas concentration in the vicinity of the tdg .",
    "the tail kinematics are broadly consistent with the interaction geometry inferred from numerical simulations .",
    "* we suggest that the lack of h@xmath0i   at the base of the northern tail is due to photoionization by uv photons escaping the disk starburst region .",

    "it is not clear whether the tdg candidates identified by schweizer ( 1978 ) and mirabel et  al .",

    "<S> we present new vla c+d - array h@xmath0i  observations and optical and nir imaging of the well known interacting system ngc 4038/9 , `` the antennae '' . at low spatial resolution ( @xmath1 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the radio data reach a limiting column density of @xmath2 @xmath3 , providing significantly deeper mapping of the tidal features than afforded by earlier h@xmath0i  maps . at relatively high spatial resolution ( @xmath4 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the radio data reveal a wealth of gaseous sub - structure both within the main bodies of the galaxies and along the tidal tails . in agreement with previous h@xmath0i  studies , we find that the northern tail has h@xmath0i  along its outer length , but none along its base . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the h@xmath0i  at the base of this tail has been ionized by massive stars in the disk of ngc 4038 . </S>",
    "<S> the gas in the southern tail has a bifurcated structure , with one filament lying along the optical tail and another running parallel to it but with no optical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the two filaments join just before the location of several star forming regions near the end of the tail . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0ivelocity field at the end of the tail is dominated by strong velocity gradients which suggest that at this location the tail is bending away from us . </S>",
    "<S> we delineate and examine two regions within the tail previously identified as possible sites of a so - called `` tidal dwarf galaxy '' condensing out of the expanding tidal material . </S>",
    "<S> the tail velocity gradients mask any clear kinematic signature of a self - gravitating condensation in this region . </S>",
    "<S> a dynamical analysis suggest that there is not enough mass in gas alone for either of these regions to be self - gravitating . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if they are bound they require a significant contribution to their dynamical mass from evolved stars or dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> even if there are no distinct dynamical tidal entities , it is clear that there is a unique concentration of gas , stars and star forming regions within the southern tail : the h@xmath0ichannel maps show clear evidence for a significant condensation near the tail star forming regions , with the single - channel h@xmath0i  column densities higher than anywhere else in the system , including within the main disks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the data reveal h@xmath0i  emission associated with the edge - on  superthin \" scd galaxy eso 572g045 that lies just beyond the southern tidal tail of the antennae , showing it to be a companion system .    </S>",
