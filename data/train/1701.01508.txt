    "finite size systems have a great deal of interest to our comprehension of several phenomena , particularly those involving critical systems @xcite .",
    "the main question is : how far can one reduce the size of a system without disturbing its critical universal properties ?",
    "consider three - dimensional infinite ( bulk ) systems in a cubic lattice .",
    "if one dimension perpendicular to the planes of the critical material slab is reduced , one has a geometry of thin films , the critical temperature is lower in comparison with that from the bulk and the system still has divergences in its thermodynamic potentials .",
    "the thermodynamic limit can be safely taken in these thin films provoking the physical divergences , in stark contrast with thin films which are finite in all directions . in the latter , the thermodynamic limit _",
    "can not be taken _ and instead of the cusp - like divergences , the maximum corresponding to the critical temperature is no longer discontinous but it is `` rounded '' @xcite .",
    "we can also consider systems with two reduced dimensions and one infinite dimension .",
    "their classical phase transitions effects appear , for instance in a cylindrical geometry regarding @xmath2 nanowires @xcite , in the study of potts model in long cylinders @xcite , etc .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", the fabrication of high - quality thin films is commonly based on epitaxial growth over a substrate @xcite .",
    "in general , ferromagnetic properties of epitaxially grown thin films depend upon the substrate . if the substrate forms a heterostruture with the original film , for instance , in @xmath3 @xcite , ferrolectricity is induced in the heterostructure due to epitaxial strain in the @xmath4 planes ( which is originally bulk ferromagnetic ) .",
    "depending on the method chosen and the substrate where the film is epitaxially grown , the critical properties of the bulk can be very different from that of the film itself : there can be effects of interfaces @xcite ( and its applications in the electroceramics industry @xcite ) , surfaces @xcite , etc .",
    "the parallel plate geometry is certainly important in the construction of microscopic devices as a stack of several layers of material in manufacturing , for example , high performance disks for memory storage @xcite . in particular , multiferroic materials show ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity and are ideal for that purpose @xcite , such that the comprehension of those effects in finite - systems would be worthwhile . for",
    "a recent overview with a broader perspective and a mix of applications , see for instance @xcite .",
    "however , the epitaxial growth method of thin films named metal - organic chemical vapor deposition ( @xmath5 ) is rather efficient to produce high - quality films with bulk properties , since the substrate can be `` sheared '' in the final process .",
    "this technique was employed in single crystal films of @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the post - growth analysis exhibited normal bulk magnetic properties .",
    "( there are also examples of materials whose molecular structure is composed by different atomic species in which this method of producing thin films show similar magnetic properties with those from bulk samples , albeit not so simply ; see ref .",
    "hence , we learn that thin films produced in this manner yields a firm basis to investigate finite size effects realized experimentally in a simplified way .",
    "the field - theoretical description of critical properties for this geometry utilizing green s functions in momentum space was initiated by nemirovsky and freed @xcite utilizing a massive method involving only bulk fields with several boundary conditions on the limiting surfaces .",
    "recently , the renormalized one - particle irreducible ( @xmath7 ) framework was devised and extended to massless fields as well , subject to periodic ( @xmath8 ) and antiperiodic ( @xmath9 ) boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "after that , the @xmath7 vertex part formalism was generalized to include dirichlet ( @xmath10 ) and neumann ( @xmath11 ) boundary conditions in a non - trivial unified fashion by renormalizing the primitively divergent vertex parts at nonzero external quasi - momenta @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation within this picture is realized when each plate has linear dimensions of infinite extent .",
    "these thin films satisfy the thermodynamic limit and were shown to have critical exponents identical to bulk systems and independent of boundary conditions , using massive or massless regimes for the renormalized volumetric order parameters ( fields ) , provided the distance between the limiting surfaces is not too small .    in this work",
    "we propose the renormalized one - particle ( @xmath7 ) irreducible formalism at null external quasi - momenta in the treatment of a critical system defined in a parallel plate geometry , whose order parameter is subject to neuman boundary conditions ( @xmath11 ) at the limiting surfaces constituted by @xmath12-dimensional hyperplanes located at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the space dimension perpendicular to the plates .",
    "we see finite size corrections to the bulk behavior which are @xmath0-dependent . in the limit @xmath1",
    "we show that the bulk behavior is recovered and all corrections tend to zero .",
    "contrarily , in the limit @xmath15 we demonstrate how the `` dimensional crossover '' @xcite shows up , overcoming the bulk behavior through non - trivial surface left - over , entirely out of bulk fields . differently from previous approaches ,",
    "the appearance of surface effects is due neither to the presence of interfaces between two materials ( or the same material in different structural phases ) nor the presence of external surface fields .",
    "interestingly , surface effects emerge through dimensional crossover for @xmath8 and @xmath11 but are absent ( or are much weaker , so to speak ) in @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast with the situation for @xmath8 and @xmath9 which preserve translation invariance @xcite , we will show that in the present framework @xmath11 do break the translation invariance of the theory in line with the result from the unified treatment @xcite .",
    "moreover , the present method is by far simpler than the latter in the treatment of @xmath11 .",
    "if the system is kept away from the dimensional crossover region , we prove that the critical exponents are the same of those from the bulk system , which is consistent with the results from the above previous @xmath7 vertex part and independent of boundary conditions .",
    "the ideas and results are presented as follows .",
    "we write down the bare lagrangian density out of solely bulk fields and offer a quick review of the decomposition of the fields in terms of its fourier components and basis functions in section ii .",
    "section iii will be the starting point with the basis functions from the lagrangian density in the exponential representation .",
    "we write down the tensors corresponding to @xmath7 vertex parts ( with and without composite operators ) . utilizing the zero mode basis function as well , due to our choice of normalization conditions",
    ", we find later the complete set of feynman graphs up to three - loop order . in section",
    "iv we tie up the formulation of massive fields with a quick analysis of the one - loop diagram for the coupling constant and prove that the finite size corrections do not require normal ordering at zero external quasi - momenta .",
    "we show that the limit of validity of the @xmath16-expansion can be interpreted consistently with that from the unified technique and compute the critical exponents . in appendix",
    "a we summarize the results of all massive integrals . in section",
    "v we introduce the massless framework in parallel with the massive case .",
    "thereby , the critical exponents are shown to be identical in both massive and massless formulations .",
    "they agree exactly with those obtained from the infinite ( bulk ) system .",
    "the results of all massless diagrams are presented in appendix b. the conclusions are the subject of section vi .",
    "the bare lagrangian density involving only volumetric ( bulk ) fields in the parallel plate geometry is given by : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the bare order parameter , mass ( @xmath20 is the bare reduced temperature proportional to @xmath21 ) and coupling constant , respectively .",
    "note that although @xmath22 denotes the critical temperature of the infinite system ( `` bulk '' ) and is in general different of the shifted critical temperature of the finite system @xmath23 , in principle the difference is not sufficient to provoke a functional variation in the critical exponents at the critical region . obviously , proving this with quantitative computation of the critical exponents is appropriate , but it is reasonable to note that the fluctuations there do not distinguish between these two types of temperatures @xcite , provided the plates are of infinite extent in each linear dimension . as discussed above ,",
    "if the plates are not infinite , instead of a spike - like divergence of the critical quantity under consideration with its associated critical exponent , the finite size of the system provokes a `` rounding '' in the divergence . on aforementioned experimental grounds ,",
    "the temperature @xmath23 yields a qualitative picture which resembles that from the bulk system .",
    "we shall use henceforth the bulk critical temperature in what follows .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite in order to fix the notation , which is quite similar to that we shall employ hereafter .",

    "the coordinate vector @xmath27 belonging to the @xmath12-dimensional plates along with the perpendicular @xmath14 axis constitutes the collective vector @xmath28 .",
    "there are parallel plates separated by a lattice constant space along the @xmath14 direction and filling in the region between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the field satisfies @xmath31 for @xmath11 .",
    "the order parameter is related to its fourier modes in momentum space through @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the momentum vector characterizing the @xmath12-dimensional space .",
    "the basis functions @xmath34 specify the ( hyper)plate and have a discrete index , with eigenvalues @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xmath37 is the quasi - momentum along the @xmath14-direction .",
    "the free bare massive ( @xmath38 ) propagator in momentum space is given by the expression @xmath39 .",
    "the propagator can be represented graphically by a line with two extremities : the left one characterized by the index @xmath40 and the right labeled by @xmath41 , which implies the presence of the overall factor @xmath42 , which will be ignored in what follows without loss of generality .",
    "the propagator for the massless case is obtained by setting @xmath43 .    from our construction of a generic feynman diagram previously in the unified formalism",
    ", we just highlight that each momentum line ( propagator ) must be multiplied by @xmath44 and the @xmath45 vertices are multipled by the tensor @xmath46 . recall that this is the way in which the finite size effect is implemented as an internal symmetry , consisting of the direct product of these tensors with the usual ones from the @xmath26 symmetry .",
    "the basis functions for @xmath11 have the nonzero modes @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) as well as the zero mode @xmath49 .",
    "the explicit choice of vanishing external quasi - momenta in the renormalized theory implies that the zero mode basis function participates in the feynman rules in a simpler but different form in comparison with the unified approach involving @xmath10 and @xmath11 renormalized at nonzero external quasi - momenta .",
