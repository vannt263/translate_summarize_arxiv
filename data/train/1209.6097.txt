    "topological insulators ( tis ) have generated a great interest in the fields of condensed matter physics , chemistry and materials science  @xcite .",
    "generally , compounds can be classified into metals and insulators according to their band structures .",
    "however , the ti is an insulator in the bulk , while it conducts on the surface like a metal .",
    "tis has 2d ( also called quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state ) and 3d versions .",
    "they have a full energy gap in the bulk , but host topologically protected gapless edge ( 2d ) or surface ( 3d ) states ( see fig .  [ topo ] ) .",
    "a ti can easily be identified by a few simple rules : the presence of large spin orbit coupling ( soc ) , an odd number of band inversions ( bi ) between the conduction and the valence band by increasing the average nuclear charge , and a sign change of the symmetry of the molecular orbitals  @xcite .",
    "many tis were known as excellent thermoelectric ( te ) materials , for ti and te compounds usually favor the same material features , such as heavy elements and the smaller energy gap .",
    "thus tis maybe good te candidates and vice versa . here",
    "we present a short overview on to tis and give examples of compound classes were both tis and good te properties can be found .",
    "in principle , in thermoelectric materials a temperature gradient creates an electric potential , and thus these materials could be used as te converters for power generation . te",
    "converter can be used for the conversion of a part of the low - grade waste heat generated by engines , industrial furnaces , gas pipes , etc . to electricity .",
    "the performance of the te materials is characterized by the figure of merit @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electrical conductivity , _ s _ the seebeck coefficient and @xmath5 the thermal conductivity . a larger value of @xmath2 means a higher energy conversion efficiency , which achieves its thermodynamic limit of the carnot efficiency when @xmath2 is infinite . to reach a high figure of merit ,",
    "a large seebeck coefficient , a high electrical conductivity @xmath4 , and a low thermal conductivity @xmath5 are required .",
    "unfortunately , these parameters are connected : a high seebeck coefficient prefers a low carrier concentration , which leads to a low electrical conductivity ; the high electrical conductivity comes together with high thermal conductivity ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ thermo ] , the maximum @xmath2 of bulk bi@xmath0te@xmath1 lies in an optimal region where the carrier density is between a semiconductor and a metal .",
    "high performance te materials are are typically heavily doped semiconductors to give metallic bulk conductivity .    ,",
    "seebeck coefficient _ s _ , thermal conductivity @xmath5 and carrier concentration .",
    "the optimum figure of merit is reached via a compromise of the three parameters .",
    "( data taken from  @xcite ) ]    to increase the electrical conductivity , narrow band - gap materials with high mobilities are a natural choice . in these materials , the energy gap can be tuned ( e.g. by chemical compositions ) to optimize the te performance . to reduce the thermal conductivity ,",
    "elements with large atomic mass are favored . besides changing these intrinsic properties ,",
    "other approaches are also employed to reduce the thermal conductivity  @xcite . for examples , introducing grain boundaries and forming alloys can dramatically enhance the phonon scattering .",
    "tis can occur in 2- and 3-dimensional materials ( fig .",
    "[ topo]a , b ) .",
    "the 2d ti has wire - like metallic edge states , in which counter - propagating electrons have opposite spin .",
    "a 3d ti has surface states around the entire material , usually forming a single or an odd number of dirac cones . in the bulk",
    "however , tis are usually narrow gap semiconductors .",
    "it is possible to distinct regular semiconductors such as si , which do not possess such edge or surface states , from tis by the topology of their band structure .",
    "the condition of a material to be a ti is an odd number of bis in the bulk due to relativistic effects , especially soc . just as",
    "a mbius strip is different from a regular strip of paper in its topology ( fig .",
    "[ topo]c ) , tis are distinct from regular semiconductors and insulators due to the topology of their band structures@xcite . important for",
    "the discussion above is the conservation of time reversal symmetry ( trs ) . here",
    "trs means that there are no external magnetic fields , magnetic moments and magnetic impurities in the system .",
    "the interface state of a ti is inherently robust against nonmagnetic impurities and surface disorders , distinguished from normal surface states such as dangling bonds . in a ti ,",
    "the forward- and backward - moving topological edge states are a pair of time reversal conjugates , i.e. @xmath7 with @xmath8 beeing the time reversal operator , and therefore have opposite spin orientation . in this way",
    ", an electron can not be scattered from a forward - moving state into a backward - moving one without reversing its spin .",
    "hence backscattering is suppressed under trs due to this spin - momentum locking .",
    "the necessary condition for a compound to be a ti is an odd number of band inversions ( bis ) between conduction and valence bands  @xcite .",
    "this bi is due to relativistic effects such as soc , which can be enhanced by substituting light elements with heavier elements from the same group . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bands ] , the conduction and valence bands get inverted and cross each other when soc is strong enough .",
    "a new energy gap emerges at the crossing points due to soc , called band anti - crossing . if this type of bi happens odd times in the whole brillouin zone , a ti forms .",
    "it is known that strong soc leads to spin split states on the surface due to the rashba - effect .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ bands ] ( d ) ) . however , the topological surface states are different in topology from regular rashba - split states .",
    "the former connects the conduction and valence bands , and can not be gapped away .",
    "in contrast , the latter is only related to the conduction or valence bands , and can be deformed smoothly into the bulk bands , equivalent to a fully gapped band structure .         structure ( low - temperature @xmath9-phase of ag@xmath0te ) c ) ; filling up the octahedral vacancies in the zns structure or the tetrahedral vacancies ind the zns structure leads to the family of heuslers ( laptbi ) d ) ; by adding more `` stuffing '' atoms to a heusler , the so - called \" inverse  heusler structure is obtained ( li@xmath0agsb ) e ) ; doubling the cubic heusler unit cell leads to a chalcopyrite structure ( autlte@xmath0)(f ) . ]",
    "in 2006 , bernevig , hughes and zhang  @xcite predicted hgte quantum wells ( qws ) to be 2d topological insulators .",
    "a qw consists of a thin hgte layer sandwiched between two conventional insulating layers of cdte ( fig .",
    "[ topo]a ) .",
    "the low energy bands near the fermi level of hgte and cdte are close to the @xmath10 point in the brillouin zone , as shown in fig.[zb - heusler_fingerprint ] . like the common semiconductor gaas",
    ", cdte has a band ordering with @xmath11-orbital @xmath12 band as the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) and @xmath13-orbital @xmath14 as the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "the cbm and vbm are separated by a large energy gap @xmath15 ev .",
    "compared to cd , hg is a heavier element and has stronger relativistic effects . as a result of both the darwin term and the soc",
    ", hgte exhibits an `` inverted '' band ordering : the @xmath13 band is shifted above @xmath11 band . due to cubic symmetry these two @xmath13 bands are degenerate at the @xmath10 point .",
    "therefore , hgte is a zero - gap semiconductor with an inverted band ordering .",
    "hgte can open an energy gap when the cubic symmetry is broken by strain or by lowering the dimensionality .",
    "the conventional semiconductor cdte serves as an ideal barrier layer for qws .",
    "when the qw thickness @xmath16 is smaller than a critical value @xmath17 , the qw should behave similarly to cdte and has normal band ordering . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath18 , the qw should behave more like hgte with inverted bands , forming a 2d ti .",
    "soon after the theoretical prediction , the 2d ti was observed experimentally in hgte quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "both hgte and cdte crystallize in the zinc - blende structure ( fig .",
    "[ cubicstructures]a ) , which is a relative of the diamond structure . on the other hand , simple rocksalt compounds formed by pu and am ( fig .",
    "[ cubicstructures]b ) lie on the boundary between metals and insulators , where the 5f electrons change character from itinerant to localized . in comparison to standard tis such as bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and hgte ,",
    "the actinide compounds have stronger three - dimensional ionic bonds .",
    "a single dirac cone at @xmath10 point of e.g. amn shows up in the energy gap , which demonstrates the nontrivial nature of the materials  @xcite .      as analogs of hgte ,",
    "heusler compounds are one of the most versatile class of compounds  @xcite .",
    "they are named after their discoverer fritz heusler  @xcite , and up to now this class of materials includes more than 1500 different compounds . semiconducting behavior",
    "is mainly found in the subclass of the half - heusler ( _ xyz _ ) compounds . a half - heusler material _",
    "xyz _ is a compound consisting of a covalent and an ionic part : the _ x _ and _ y _ atoms have a distinct cationic character , whereas _ z _ can be seen as the anionic counterpart . the most electropositive element ( usually a main group element , a transition metal or a rare earth element ) is placed at the beginning of the formula .",
    "the most electronegative element is a main group element from the second half of the periodic table .",
    "figure  [ periodictablehh ] shows the element distribution of _ x _ , _ y _ and _ z _ within the periodic table .        generally , the half - heusler phases crystallize in a non - centrosymmetric structure corresponding to the space group f@xmath193 m ( no .  216 ) . within the lattice , the atoms on wyckoff positions @xmath20 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )",
    "form the ionic nacl - type substructure , while the atoms on @xmath20 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) build the covalent zns - type one ( fig .",
    "[ cubicstructures]d ) .",
    "the properties of half - heusler compounds can be predicted just by counting the number of their valence electrons  @xcite , and the band gaps can be tuned from zero up to 4  ev by simply changing their chemical composition .",
    "thus they attracted great interest in the field of thermoelectrics and topological insulators .",
    "compounds with eight valence electrons per formula unit are closely related to classical semiconductors , such as silicon and gaas . within this class of materials , 3 subgroups have to be differentiated : the nowotny - juza phases a@xmath25b@xmath26c@xmath27 with a@xmath25 = li , cu , ag , b@xmath26 = be , mg , zn , cd , and c@xmath27 =",

    "these materials contain transition metal elements with almost completely filled @xmath30-electron shell which is added to the valence electron count , again leading to a closed - shell configuration and semiconducting properties . the broad class of heusler systems was systematically investigated and many new ternary systems with non - trivial band structures were suggested  @xcite . as half - heusler compounds with",

    "the band structures of both heavier compounds , hgte and scptbi , exhibit the band inversion caused by the strong spin - orbit coupling : @xmath12 ( blue ) is now situated below @xmath14 ( red ) which remains at the fermi energy ( horizontal dashed line ) . ]    due to such similarity , the mechanisms responsible for the driving the system into a certain topological class , are the same for the zinc - blende as well as for the c1@xmath31 heusler compounds .",
    "the band inversion at the @xmath10 point , which drives these materials into trivial or non - trivial topological class , solely depends on the interplay of two competing mechanisms .",
    "first is the orbital @xmath32-hybridization , which opens a real band gap between @xmath11-like state of @xmath12-symmetry shifted into the unoccupied region and the @xmath13-state containing @xmath14-symmetric representation , which is partially occupied and thus degenerated at the fermi energy .",
    "the second mechanism is the spin - orbit coupling , which splits the @xmath13-shell of the main - group element ( e.g. se , te , bi ) into the higher @xmath33 ( @xmath14-symmetric ) and lower - energy @xmath34 bands .",
    "if the spin - orbit coupling is strong enough , the @xmath11-like band pops inside this energy gap and gets occupied .",
    "this causes the desired band inversion .",
    "the diversity of heusler materials opens wide possibilities to tune the band inversion by choosing compounds with appropriate hybridization strength ( by lattice parameter ) and the magnitude of spin - orbit coupling ( by the nuclear charge number @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of atoms in the unit cell ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the great advantage of ternary compounds is their multifunctionality .",
    "many of these ternary zero - gap semiconductors ( _ _ ln__aupb , _ _",
    "ln__pdbi , _ _ ln__ptsb and _ _ ln__ptbi ) contain the rare - earth element _ ln _ which can be used alternatively for managing the additional properties ranging from superconductivity ( e.g. laptbi  @xcite ) to antiferromagnetism ( e.g. gdptbi  @xcite ) and heavy - fermion behavior ( e.g. ybptbi  @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ cubicstructures ] , there are more newly identified ti systems related to the hgte structure : inverse heusler compounds like li@xmath0agsb ( fig .  [ cubicstructures]e ) with all tetrahedral and octahedral sides filled in the ccp structure of the main group metal ( sb , bi , or te )  @xcite .",
    "another variant is ag@xmath0te in the high - temperature cubic phase  @xcite , corresponding to an inverse caf@xmath0 structure ( fig .",

    "similarly to the hgte , all topologically - nontrivial semiconducting heusler systems with c1@xmath37 structure are zero - gap semiconductors ( often called semimetals ) , rather than real insulating materials . as was mentioned above",
    ", the reason for that is the partial filling of the @xmath33 states due to the band degeneracy by the cubic symmetry . on one hand , a 2d ti can be realized using heusler compounds by forming qw structures , in which an energy gap opened due to the confinement effect in the lower dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "a 3d ti can be achieved by introducing strain to the bulk to break the cubic symmetry .",
    "this was ever successfully demonstrated in the bulk hgte with the in - plane strain  @xcite .",

    "one can make a honeycomb layer formed by @xmath39 and @xmath40 atoms .",
    "subsequently one can have a stable layered structure with a triangle @xmath41 lattice stuffed in between neighboring @xmath42 honeycomb layers .",
    "the low energy bands structures is determined by the atomic orbitals of @xmath39 and @xmath40 atoms , while @xmath41 is to fulfill the 8- or 18-electron rule .",
    "similar to heusler compounds , one can design a band inversion inside the @xmath42 layer , resulting in a qsh layer . in a 3d lattice of stacked qsh layers ,",

    "the @xmath13-type doping ( sc ) creates holes in the triply degenerate valence band at the @xmath10-point whereas the @xmath43-type doping ( v ) supplies the electrons to the single conduction band above the indirect gap at the @xmath41-point .",
