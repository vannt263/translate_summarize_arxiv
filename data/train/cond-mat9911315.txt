    "in a preceding paper@xcite ( referred to as i ) , we have implemented the so called gwa@xcite using the all - electron projected augmented wave and applied it successfully to compute the electronic structure of some small , medium , and large - band - gap semiconductors : si , gaas , alas , inp , mg@xmath0si , c , and licl .",
    "we have then shown that the gwa accounts for most of the discrepancy between the lda and experiment regarding the energy position of the conduction states . the remaining discrepancy with experiment",
    "is believed to be due either to the way the decoupling of the core and valence electrons is performed or to the non - selfconsistent implementation of our all - electron gw method .",
    "it is then clear that the gwa is a useful method for calculating the quasiparticle properties of materials , @xcite and many applications using this method are now available .",
    "in particular , it has been successfully used to obtain a variety of physical properties , ranging form the band - width narrowing in alkali - metals , and their clusters,@xcite to the understanding of the surface reconstruction of semiconductors @xcite , or the orientational disorder and the photoemission spectra of solid c@xmath3.@xcite    nevertheless , one of the most interesting quasiparticle application is the understanding of the many - body effects on the single particle excitation s spectra , such as the optical spectra of semiconductors , and it is still relatively less explored . in this",
    "regards , the recent `` ab - initio '' inclusion of local - field and excitonic effects in the calculation of some semiconductor dielectric functions is a great achievement .",
    "@xcite there is , however , no systematic study of the trend of the size of these effects with respect to several types of semiconductors .",
    "it is therefore important to study the trend of the local - field contribution to the intensities of the structures observed in the optical spectra of various types of semiconductors .    to date",
    "all local - field calculations are based on pseudopotential methods . in particular , louie ,",
    "chelikowsky , and cohen used the empirical pseudo - potential ( epp ) method @xcite to computed the optical properties of si . recently",
    "albrecht _ et al .",
    "_ used the ab - initio pp for si@xcite , and gavrilenko and bechstedt for sic , si , and c@xcite .",
    "however , these pp calculations do not agree with the epp@xcite , and do not provide any definite trend for the size of local - field contribution as a function of the semiconductor s type .    in this paper , we use our newly developed all - electron gwa based on the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite to compute the local - field effect on various types of semiconductors .",
    "the dynamical dielectric function is computed in the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) with and without local - field effects using both the lda and quasiparticle energies calculated within our gwa method .",
    "the aim being a systematic study of the local field effects in all these semiconductors in order to understand its contribution to the macroscopic dynamical dielectric function , to the electron loss energy spectrum , and to the static dielectric constant .",
    "the latter being a ground state property , and should , in principle , be well described by an lda calculation including the local - field effects .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the second section we introduce briefly our method of calculation . in the third section",
    "we apply it to determine the optical properties of two distinct semiconductor groups : some small and medium band gap semiconductors : si , gaas , alas , inp , and mg@xmath0si , and some large band gap semiconductors or insulators : c and licl .",
    "we then compare our results with available calculations and experiments .",
    "we will also discuss the computed values of the static dielectric constant using the lda with and without local - field effects and the corresponding quasiparticle results .",
    "this will lead us to discuss the excitonic effect and its contribution to the calculated quasiparticle static dielectric constants .",
    "in this paper , we extend the projector - augmented wave method(paw)@xcite for solve the kohn - sham equations to the determination of the optical properties of semiconductors . to make a quantitative comparison to experimental results we correct the lda eigenvalues using the quasiparticle energies .",
    "as described in our previous paper@xcite we can find the excitation energies of the system by solving a quasiparticle equation instead of locating the poles of the green s function .",
    "the quasiparticle energies @xmath4 are determined from the electron selfenergy operator @xmath5 :    @xmath6    here , t is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath7 is the external ( ionic ) potential , @xmath8 is the hartree potential due to the average coulomb repulsion of the electrons . in the gwa , @xmath9 is approximated by a convolution with respect to the frequency variable of the green s function , @xmath10 , with the screened interaction @xmath11 calculated within the rpa .        in a crystal , which possesses lattice translation symmetry , a small electric perturbation @xmath12 of wave vector @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 produces responses @xmath15 of wave vectors @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 being reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "thus , the dielectric matrix describing these responses , is of the form @xmath19 and it can be written as : @xmath20 an external macroscopic electric field can be viewed as a perturbation of vanishingly small wave vector @xmath21 and , therefore , the screening of the external macroscopic field is given by the matrix element @xmath22 of the inverse dielectric matrix . in insulating crystals , this results in a formula for the macroscopic dielectric function : @xmath23_{{\\bf 0},{\\bf 0}}}\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as : @xmath24",
    "the first term of this equation is the interband contribution to the macroscopic dielectric function and the second term represents the local field contribution to @xmath25 .",
    "the determination of the macroscopic dielectric constant amounts to the computation of the inverse of @xmath26 .",
    "adler and wiser@xcite have derived , essentially by an extension of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , an approximation to @xmath27 for longitudinal fields , @xmath28          m^{nm}_{{\\bf g}}({\\bf k},{\\bf q } )          \\left [ m^{nm}_{{\\bf g}^{\\prime}}({\\bf k},{\\bf q})\\right]^ { * } }           { e_{n } ( { \\bf k}-{\\bf q})-e_{m}({\\bf k } ) + \\omega + i\\delta}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the band indices , @xmath31 is the zero temperature fermi distribution , @xmath32 is the crystal volume and @xmath33 are the matrix elements @xmath34 which are calculated as described in our preceding paper i in the context of the gw approximation . in this expression , the time dependence of the field",
    "was assumed to be @xmath35 and the small positively defined constant @xmath36 guarantees that the matrix elements of @xmath37 are analytic functions in the half upper plane .",
    "such a matrix could be separated into an hermitian part @xmath38 and an anti - hermitian part @xmath39 according to @xmath40 with @xmath41 for positive @xmath14 given by @xmath42^ { * } \\delta\\left ( \\omega -\\left[e_{c}({\\bf k})-e_{v } ( { \\bf k}-{\\bf q})\\right]\\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath43 defined by a kramers kronig ( kk ) transform as @xmath44 it should be noted here that the matrix elements of @xmath41 and @xmath43 could be chosen to be real if the inversion is contained in the point group of the crystal .",
    "the calculation of the head element @xmath45 and of the wing elements @xmath46 necessitate special care if we want to determine the optical properties of semiconductors when the gw approximation or the scissors - shift approximation is used to determine the electronic structure . instead of handling numerically @xmath47 where the quasiparticle wave functions @xmath48 and the quasiparticle energies @xmath4",
    "are to be used , it is reasonable to approximate the quasiparticle wave function with the lda wave function , and take the limit analytically@xcite : @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the lda wave functions and energies for band @xmath29 and wave vector @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "indeed , it was shown by inspection that for si the lda and the gw wave functions have more than 99% overlap@xcite . if the scissors - shift approximation is used , it is easy to show that @xmath53 where @xmath54 defines the rigid shift of the conduction bands with respect to the valence bands .    in the above formalism",
    "we have neglected the exchange - correlation contribution to the dielectric function .",
    "the calculation of this contribution amounts basically to the determination of the exchange - correlation kernel @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the exchange - correlation energy and potential , respectively , and @xmath58 is the charge density at @xmath59 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath60 is much more complicated in all - electron than in a pseudo - potential method , since one has to determine the matrix of the kernel in the fourier space .",
    "indeed , the fft of the exchange - correlation kernel converges very slowly with the number of @xmath61-vectors in reciprocal space because of the oscillating nature of the charge density in real space .",
    "fortunately , it has been shown that this kernel contribution to the total dielectric function is small.@xcite      the size of the dielectric matrix is critical for the convergence of the optical spectrum .",
    "we have found that a size of @xmath62 for all systems studied here is good for the convergence of the optical spectra , except for licl where the convergence was achieved for a matrix size of @xmath63 .",
    "the imaginary part of each matrix element @xmath64 is evaluated in energy intervals of 0.1 ev up to 200 ev .",
    "then the real part @xmath43 is deduced via a kk transformation defined previously ( see eq . ( [ kk ] ) ) .",
    "the linear tetrahedron method@xcite is employed to perform the summation over the brillouin zone which appears in eq .",
    "( [ imaginary_part ] ) .",
    "we use 8000 @xmath65-points in the full brillouin zone to calculate the head element and 1000 @xmath65-points to calculate the wing elements and the body elements .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath64 , the time reversal symmetry and the symmetry properties are used to reduce the number of matrix elements to be computed .",
    "the dynamical dielectric function of all the semiconductors studied here are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ e2_local_field ] ) .",
    "the local - field effects are represented by the second term on the right of this equation . to test the accuracy of the all - electron paw method we have computed the imaginary - part of the dielectric function of si and gaas without local field and compared them to the full - potential linear muffin - tin ( fplmto ) results@xcite .",
    "[ e2_sigaas_fplmto ] shows that the agreement with the fplmto spectra is excellent .",
    "these results are interesting because they set , for the first time , the standard for an accurate lda dielectric function of si and gaas computed by two different all - electron methods .",
    "this is encouraging since the lmto method is a state - of - the - art first principles method for electronic structure , and in comparison , the paw formalism is much simpler , but nevertheless the method does nt loss any accuracy .    before presenting our calculated optical properties of semiconductors",
    ", we would like to mention the different ways we have obtained the optical spectra : ( 1 ) we have used our lda calculated band structure to directly compute the optical spectra .",
    "( 2 ) we have used the so called scissors - operator energy shift to the lda eigenvalues .",
    "the value of the shift corresponds to our gwa correction of the lda direct band gap at the @xmath66 point .",
    "( 3 ) finally , we used the gwa calculated quasiparticle energies across the brillouin zone .",
    "all these three types of calculations were produced with and without local - field effects .",
    "the accuracy of the macroscopic function depends on the convergence of all the elements of the microscopic dielectric matrix .",
    "as stated in the previous section we have found that a matrix of 65 by 65 @xmath61-vectors and the use of 200 bands in the interband transitions produce a well converged @xmath37 , except for licl where a matrix of @xmath63 @xmath17-vectors is used .",
    "[ body_wing ] shows different elements of the microscopic dielectric function of silicon versus photon energy up to 70 ev .",
    "the highest intensity of these elements is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath67 element .",
    "we compared our results to these of gavrilenko and bechstedt@xcite and found that the agreement with their results is only at the semi - quantitative level .",
    "we are surprised to find that gavrilenko and bechstedt have a relatively large intensity in the band gap of their @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "[ e12_si_lf ] shows the calculated real and imaginary part of the dielectric function of si versus photon energy up to 10 ev with and without lf and qp energy shift .",
    "these calculations are compared to the experimental results of aspnes and studna.@xcite the dashed curve represent the difference between the calculated optical spectra using the calculated gw quasiparticle energies and the one obtained using the scissors - operator energy shift to the lda eigenvalues .",
    "this spectral difference is small justifying the use of the scissors - operator for the calculation of the optical spectra of small and medium gap semiconductors . because of this small change of the dielectric function due to the use of the quasiparticle energies , and because of the high cpu cost in obtaining the quasiparticle energies across the whole brillouin zone , all the other small and medium gap semiconductors",
    "are calculated using only the scissors - operator shift .",
    "notice that the agreement concerning the peak positions is fortuitous , because the qp energy shift underestimates the direct band gap at @xmath66 ( for details , see paper i ) .",
    "a calculation with an energy shift which reproduces the experimental band gap will slightly overestimates the peak positions by about 0.3 ev , and this overestimation is valid for all semiconductors studied here .",
    "it is also worth mentionning that our preliminary calculation of the excitonic effects shows that in the case of si the @xmath1 , and @xmath2 peaks are shifted by about 0.2 ev towards lower photon energies , and the agreement with experiment concerning the postions and intensities of these peaks is recovered .",
    "on the other hand , in agreement with the empirical pseudopotential ( epp ) calculation of louie , chelikowsky and cohen we have found that the lf effects do not change the position of the structures present on the optical spectrum@xcite .",
    "but the intensities of the so called @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks are reduced , again in agreement with the epp .",
    "thus the local - field effects seem to improve the agreement with experiment regarding the intensity of the @xmath2 peak and the structures in the higher energy part , and worsen the agreement with experiment regarding the low energy part where the @xmath1 peak is located .",
    "it is surprising that our calculations do not agree well with the ab - initio pp calculation of gavrilenko and bechstedt@xcite which is supposed to be similar to the epm calculation .",
    "the latter calculation found that while the lf underestimates the @xmath1 peak intensity in agreement with our calculation and epp , it overestimates the @xmath2 peak intensity in disagreement with our calculation and with epp .",
    "the calculated spectrum of albrecht _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation , using the pp method , in a special limit where only local - field effects are included , agrees only qualitatively with our calculation and the epp results@xcite .",
    "their @xmath70 structure , which is located in energy above the @xmath2 structure , has a large intensity and disagrees with our calculation and other ab - initio or epp calculations@xcite .",
    "it is then not clear what makes the extra reduction of their @xmath70 peak when the excitonic effects are included .",

    "for all these semiconductor the scissors - operator energy shift , corresponding to the difference between the quasiparticle and lda eigenvalues at the @xmath66 point , is used to produce the quasiparticle optical spectra , except for c where we have represented the dielectric function obtained using the gw quasiparticle energies at each point in the brillouin zone . in this latter case the difference between the optical spectra , calculated using the gw quasiparticle energies and the scissors - operator energy shift , is shown by a dashed curve in fig .",

    "moreover , the small dielectric constants of these two large gap semiconductors indicate that excitonic effects are important .",
    "for example , the large discrepancy between our calculated spectra of diamond and experiment can be attributed to these effects .    in conclusion ,",
    "the most important trend of the lf on the optical spectra of all types of semiconductors studied here , is that : the @xmath1 s intensity reduction disagrees with experiment , whereas the @xmath2 s intensity reduction agrees well with experiment whenever available .",

    "@xcite the plasma resonance will be pushed towards higher energies in disagreement with experiment .",
    "this because the electronic structure at higher energy is most probably much better described using the lda than the gwa because : ( 1 ) at these higher energies the scattering of an electron with the atomic potential is small . in this respect , these high electronic states can be obtained from an almost free - electron theory .",

    ", we expect that the calculation with lda including the lf effect should reproduce the experimental results",
    ". however , we observe only an improvement due to this effect .",
    "we conclude that the remaining of the discrepancy with experiment is due to the used of the lda itself instead of the full density functional theory .",
    "notice that for large band gap semiconductors , the lda results including the lf effects are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "this trend was also observed by other researchers @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the quasiparticle description of the static dielectric constant , is of importance , since it will be directly compared to lda results .",
    "a comparison to experiment will show whether the excitonic effect corrections are important or not . in this respect",
    "we notice that , when the gwa energy shift and lf effects are both included , the qp calculation slightly underestimates the static dielectric function for all the semiconductors studied here regardless of the size of the band gap or the type of semiconductor .",
    "this suggests , effectively , the importance of the excitonic effects which are expected to produce a positive contribution leading to a better agreement with experiment .",
    "this positive contribution arises from the reduction of the optical band gap from its gwa counterpart , and to the transfer of the force of the oscillator towards lower photon energies .",
    "it is however interesting to remark that since for large band gap materials ( c and licl ) the static dielectric function within lda including lf effects agrees nicely with experiment , the excitonic contribution should cancel out the qp correction .",
    "we have used our previously implemented gwa within the all - electron projected augmented wave method ( paw ) to study the optical properties of some small , medium and large - band - gap semiconductors : gaas , alas , inp , mg@xmath0si , c and licl . in general",
    ", the inclusion of the the quasiparticle ( qp ) energy shift and the local - field ( lf ) effects improves the agreement with experiment .",

    "this reduction of the peak intensity worsen the agreement for the @xmath1 peak but improves it for the @xmath2 peak .",
    "this trend is observed for all the studied semiconductors and is found to be in agreement with the empirical pseudopotential ( epp ) calculation of louie , chelikowsky and cohen @xcite .",
    "the qp energy shift pushes the calculated peaks towards higher energies in agreement with experiment .",
    "however , because the calculated gwa energy shift does not always produce the correct experimental band gaps , the agreement of the peak positions with experiment in the case of si , gaas , and mg@xmath0si is fortuitous .",
