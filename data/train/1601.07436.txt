    "consider a family of dissipative dynamical systems parameterised by @xmath0 such that for each @xmath1 the corresponding dynamical system possesses a unique compact global attractor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a complete metric space with metric @xmath12 .",
    "under very mild assumptions , see for example  @xcite and the references therein , the map @xmath13 is known to be upper semicontinuous .",
    "this means that @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the hausdorff semi - distance @xmath16 however , lower semicontinuity @xmath17 and hence full continuity with respect to the hausdorff metric , is much harder to prove .    for autonomous systems ,",
    "general results require strict conditions on the structure of the unperturbed global attractor , see hale and raugel @xcite and stuart and humphries @xcite , which are rarely satisfied for complicated systems .",
    "however , in babin and pilyugin @xcite and in our previous work @xcite , continuity can be shown to hold for @xmath18 in a residual set @xmath3 using the theory of baire category under natural conditions when @xmath0 is a complete metric space .",
    "we recall this result for autonomous systems as theorem  [ auto ] below .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath19 be complete metric spaces .",
    "suppose @xmath20 is a parametrised family of semigroups on @xmath19 for @xmath21 and consider the following conditions :    * @xmath20 has a global attractor @xmath22 for every @xmath1 ; * there is a bounded subset @xmath23 of @xmath19 such that @xmath24 for every @xmath1 ; and * for @xmath25 , @xmath26 is continuous in @xmath9 , uniformly for @xmath27 in bounded subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "note that condition ( g2 ) can be strengthened and ( g3 ) weakened by replacing _ bounded _ by _ compact_. these modified conditions will be referred to as conditions ( g2@xmath28 ) and ( g3@xmath28 ) .",

    "the set of continuity points of @xmath22 is dense in @xmath0 .",
    "the proof developed in @xcite of the above theorem , which appears as theorem 5.1 in that work , is more direct than previous proofs and can be modified to establish analogous results for the pullback attractors and uniform attractors of non - autonomous systems .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "after briefly introducing some definitions and notations concerning attractors and baire category theory in section  [ prelimsec ] , we turn to section  [ pullbacksec ] where theorem  [ thm23 ] , our main result concerning pullback attractors , is proved .",
    "section  [ uniformsec ] then contains theorem  [ thm31 ] , which provides similar results for uniform attractors .",
    "in addition , we investigate the continuity of pullback and uniform attractors on the entire parameter space @xmath0 .",
    "it is proved by li and kloeden @xcite , see also our previous paper @xcite , that in case @xmath0 is compact , the continuity of the global attractors on @xmath0 is equivalent to equi - attraction of the semigroups . in section  [ equi ] , we extend this result and the notion of equi - attraction to non - autonomous and uniform attractors .",
    "theorem  [ equiback ] shows for pullback attractors that continuity is equivalent to pullback equi - attraction , while theorem  [ equiuni ] shows for uniform attractors that continuity is equivalent to uniform equi - attraction .",
    "we note that the continuity of pullback attractors is investigated by carvalho et al .",
    "@xcite , who extend the autonomous results to non - autonomous systems , under strong conditions on the structure of the pullback attractors .",
    "similarly , the notion of equi - attraction defined section  [ equi ] is a difficult property to discern for any concrete family of dynamical system .",
    "in contrast , the continuity results from sections  [ pullbacksec ] and  [ uniformsec ] only require standard conditions that are met in many applications . we demonstrate this in section  [ apps ] with the lorenz system of odes and the two - dimensional navier  stokes equations .",
    "theorem [ thm42 ] proves that the global attractors for two - dimensional incompressible navier  stokes equations with time - independent forces are continuous at a residual set of those forces .",
    "a similar result on the continuity of pullback and uniform attractors with respect to perturbations of the viscosity is established in theorem [ thm43 ] for time - dependent forces .",
    "the counterparts of these two theorems for the lorenz system are theorems [ loz1 ] and [ loz3 ] .",
    "these results point out that , even though attractors are irregular and complicated objects , at least they possess a generic robustness with respect to perturbations of certain physical parameters .",
    "thus , our results may be seen as a first step towards a general theory that covers the computational analysis of global attractors .",
    "we begin by setting some notation and defining the hausdorff metric . given a metric space @xmath29 , denote by @xmath30 the ball of radius @xmath31 centred at @xmath32 , @xmath33 write @xmath34 for the symmetric hausdorff distance @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the semi - distance between two subsets @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath11 defined in ( [ defsemidist ] )",

    "the concept of a non - autonomous process may be used to describe a non - autonomous dynamical system .",

    "@xmath48 is continuous in @xmath27 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "given a non - autonomous process , there are two common ways to characterise its asymptotic behaviour : roughly speaking , the limit of @xmath51 for a fixed @xmath49 as @xmath52 leads to the definition of the pullback attractor , while the limit of @xmath53 as @xmath54 leads to the uniform attractor , given sufficient uniformity in @xmath50 .",
    "while both characterisations describe the same object for autonomous dynamics , they may be different in the non - autonomous case .",
