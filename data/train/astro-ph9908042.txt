    "an orbital period of 9.5 min would be the shortest period of any known binary star .",

    "comparison between the x - ray position of rx j1914 + 24 ( determined using the high resolution imager , hri , on _ rosat _ ) and the optical image of motch et al ( 1996 ) showed that star ` h ' was the most likely optical counterpart ( cropper et al 1998 ) .",

    "( 7,6 ) ( 13.5,14.5 )    profile fitting photometry was carried out on the stars in the field using daophot ( stetson 1992 ) .",
    "since the profiles of the stellar images in the o and e rays differed , two profiles had to be constructed  one for each ray .",
    "we obtained differential photometry between star ` a ' and the stars in the immediate vicinity of star ` h ' and fourier transformed their light curves .",

    "whilst there are minor amplitude peaks at longer periods in both the ` upper ' and ` lower ' amplitude spectra , there is no peak which is seen in both spectra : therefore we conclude that these peaks are not significant .",

    "this contrasts with the approximate magnitude of star ` h ' as seen by motch et al .  in june 1993 of 16.6 mag . even taking into account that star ` h ' is consists of more than 1 component , ( rx j1914 + 24 being 18.2 mag , the next brightest @xmath2 19.6 ) , rx j1914 + 24 was over 1  mag fainter in @xmath0 in june 1998 compared to june 1993 .",
    "if there is a second period hidden the @xmath0 band data then its amplitude must be very small . from the noise level in the amplitude spectrum ( fig .",

    "the amplitude is expected to be greater .",
    "for instance @xmath0 band photometry of the polar v895 cen in a low state ( where there is no additional flux from cyclotron emission ) shows a peak to peak amplitude of @xmath20.4 ( stobie et al 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of such a pronounced modulation in rx j1914 + 24 is further evidence that the secondary star in this system is not a main sequence star .",

    "taking the extinction found by fitting the x - ray spectra as representative of the optical extinction , these results suggest that in the optical - ir region of the spectrum there is a component additional to a blackbody , which adds to the emission at shorter wavelengths",
    ". this could be due to emission from the accretion stream , cyclotron emission from the white dwarf or an irradiated component on the donor white dwarf .",
    "we now address these possibilities in turn .",
    "( 6,5 ) ( -3.5,-13.3 )    although we can not exclude emission from a hot accretion stream this seems unlikely because the @xmath0 band folded light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fold ] ) would be double peaked unless we are viewing the system at a low inclination . for a magnetic field of a few mg ( see below ) the optically thin ( and hence polarised ) part of the cyclotron spectrum is likely to be in red wavebands . since we do not observe a significant circularly polarised flux in @xmath0 the magnetic field is either stronger than we expect ( in which case the optically thin cyclotron harmonics would be in the uv ) or it is very low ( in which case the optically thin cyclotron harmonics would be in the far ir ) . on the other hand it is also possible that a shock does not form above the accretion region on the primary white dwarf because of the small dimensions of the system .    because the binary components are unusually close , we expect the secondary white dwarf to intercept an appreciable part of the accretion flux",
    ". observations of conventional polars show that the irradiated surface of the secondary is brighter in the trailing hemisphere ( eg southwell et al 1995 ) . assuming that the irradiated surface is much larger than the accretion region on the primary star ,",
    "then this would imply that the @xmath0 band flux peaks between @xmath310.20.6 cycles after the x - ray peak  which is indeed what we observe ( fig .",
    "[ fold ] ) .",
    "we conclude therefore that the variation in @xmath0 is probably due to irradiation of the secondary by the x - rays produced at the accretion region on the primary star .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then we can also make the assumption that the origin of the 9.5 min period seen in the @xmath0 band amplitude spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ ipower ] ) is caused by the secondary star .",
    "on the other hand the 9.5 min period seen in the _ asca _ amplitude spectrum ( fig .",

    "the fact that the amplitude peaks in the _ asca _ and @xmath0 band amplitude spectra are indistinguishable is further evidence that rx j1914 + 24 is synchronised .",
    "for semi - detached binaries , the roche - lobe - filling condition implies a unique relation between the average density of the donor star and the binary orbital period ( see eg frank , king & raine 1992 , eqn 4.8 ) . assuming that the 9.5-min period detected in rx j1914 + 24 is indeed the orbital period and that the roche lobe approximation is valid for degenerate stars",

    "if we assume that the @xmath0 band flux can be characterised by a blackbody , we find that a blackbody with the volume of a secondary roche lobe for a 9.5 min period will give the dereddend @xmath0 band flux ( table [ irmags ] ) at a distance of 100pc if it has a temperature of @xmath29500k .",

    "further the long term x - ray light curve and the _ asca _ spectrum is typical of polars .",
    "these observations reinforce the proposal of cropper et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that rx j1914 + 24 is a double degenerate polar .",
    "we now go on to discuss system parameters such as the primary stars magnetic field strength and the forces which would be needed to keep rx j1914 + 24 synchronised .      as no other periods apart from the 9.5 min period have been detected in either the x - ray or @xmath0 band light curves , we conclude that rx j1914 + 24 does not have an accretion disk . for accreting white dwarfs , the absence of an accretion disk can be due to a strong white dwarf magnetic field .",
    "when the alfvn speed , which depends on the local magnetic field strength and the density of the accretion flow is much larger than the keplerian speed at the circularisation radius , an accretion disk can not be formed . as an approximation , we may use the criterion : @xmath46 ( wickramasinghe , wu & ferrario 1991 ) to deduce the lower limit to the magnetic moment of the primary star , @xmath47 , and hence the corresponding limit to the white dwarf polar magnetic field strength . here , @xmath48 is the accretion rate and @xmath49 , which approximately equals 0.3 , is a parameter which takes into account the angle of the stream as it leaves the inner lagrangian point ( lubow & shu 1975 ) .",
    "using equation [ magmom ] we show in fig .",
    "[ kinwah ] the surface field strength required to equate the alfvn speed and the keplerian speed at the circularisation radius , as a function of the accretion rate .",
    "we also show the lower limit to the polar magnetic field of the primary white dwarf in binaries for various white dwarf masses @xmath50 and accretion luminosities @xmath51 .",
    "the orbital period of the binary is fixed at 9.5  min . as shown , if the accreting white dwarf is not massive (  1@xmath34 and accretion rate is low ( @xmath52  g  s@xmath10 ) ) , a small polar field (  1  mg ) is sufficient to prevent the accretion disk formation .    from the _ rosat _ pspc data , cropper etal .",
    "( 1998 ) deduced that the bolometric accretion luminosity of rx j1914 + 24 is @xmath53  erg  s@xmath10 ( for a distance of 100  pc and hydrogen column density @xmath54 ) .",
    "if the mass of the primary white dwarf in rx j1914 + 24 is about 1.0  @xmath34 , the surface polar field strength of the white dwarf is probably  1 mg .    ( 6,7 ) ( -14.8,-2 )      while it is possible that an orbital period longer than the 9.5 min period is hidden in the data , let us assume that rx j1914 + 24 is indeed synchronised .",
    "the geometrical configuration and synchronism of conventional polars have been investigated by many authors ( eg chanmugam & wagner 1977 ; joss , katz & rappaport 1979 ; lamb etal.1983 ; campbell 1983 , 1997 ; lamb & melia 1987 ; king , frank & whitehurst 1990 ; wu & wickramasinghe 1993 )",
    ". some earlier studies ( eg chanmugam & wagner 1977 ) implicitly implied that the diskless and synchronisation conditions are equivalent .",
    "although synchronism ensures diskless accretion , diskless accretion may not imply perfect synchronism .",
    "a proper treatment of synchronisation involves magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) interaction between the stars and the plasma between them ( see campbell 1997 ) and also the physics of stellar structures of magnetic stars .",
    "the issue of synchronisation and formation of ultra - short period double - degenerate binaries is beyond the scope of this paper and deserves a separate study .",
    "here we discuss synchronism in rx j1914 + 24 briefly only in terms of a crude comparison between the strengths of the accretion torque and the restoring magnetic torques .",
    "the accretion torque which operates about the spin axis of an accreting star is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the orbital period and @xmath57 is the roche lobe of the star . for a system with an accretion luminosity of about @xmath58  erg  s@xmath10 , which corresponds to a mass transfer rate of @xmath59  g  s@xmath10 ,",
    "the accretion torque is @xmath60 . taking the accretion luminosities deduced in cropper etal .",
    "( 1998 ) , we find that the accretion torque on the primary white dwarf in rx j1914 + 24 is 10  100 times that of conventional polars ( see wu & wickramasinghe 1993 ) .",
    "we now investigate whether this exceeds the available synchronising torque .    in conventional polars ,",
    "the accretion torque is counterbalanced by the magnetic torque and the system maintains synchronism .",
    "two types of magnetic restoring torque have been proposed .",
    "the first type is due to the torque arising from magneto - static dipole / multipole interaction between the primary and the secondary star .",
    "the second type is due to the torque arising from the mhd interaction between the stars and the plasmas between the stars . in general the second type of torque",
    "requires that the secondary star , which is a main - sequence star , has a convective envelope threaded by the magnetic field of the primary degenerate star .",
    "ohmic dissipation occurs at the envelope of the secondary star when the system departs from synchronism .",
    "we can make an estimate of the torque due to magneto - static interaction between the dipole / multipole components of the primary star and the dipole of the secondary star using the equations in wu & wickramasinghe ( 1993 ) .",
    "for an orbital period of 9.5 min , the orbital separation is @xmath61 cm .",
    "the ratio of orbital separation to the radius of the accreting white dwarf is @xmath220 for a 1white dwarf . for @xmath62=10 mg and @xmath63",
    "g @xmath64 we find from wu & wickramasinghe ( 1993 ) that the torque due to magneto - static interaction is of the order of 10@xmath65 dyne cm or less .",
    "( there is some uncertainty since we do not know the magnetic field configuration ) .",
    "this is of the same order or less than the accretion torque ( equation [ acctorque ] ) .",
    "therefore it is not clear if this mechanism alone is able to maintain the synchronism of rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "degenerate white dwarfs are highly conducting bodies . when synchronism is disturbed , ohmic dissipation occurs much more efficiently in the plasma between the stars than in the stellar envelopes of the white dwarfs .",
    "thus , the large scale mhd instabilities of the field configuration will determine the strength of the restoring magnetic torque ( lamb etal .",
    "according to lamb & melia ( 1988 ) , if both the primary and secondary stars have a non - negligible magnetic moments , the mhd torque acting on the primary star is @xmath66 where @xmath47 and @xmath67 are the magnetic moments of the primary and the companion stars respectively , @xmath68 is the pitch angle of the dipole magnetic field of the primary star at the companion star , and @xmath69 is the orbital separation .",
    "for the configurations of polars , the value of @xmath68 is approximately 1 ( low 1982 ; lamb etal .  1983 ) .    for a primary with mass @xmath21 , fig .",
    "[ kinwah ] implies that the surface magnetic field of the primary is  a few mg if we assume a mass transfer rate similar to that observed by cropper et al .",
    "this implies a magnetic moment @xmath70 .",
    "thus , provided that the secondary star has a similar intrinsic or induced magnetic moment , equation [ mhd ] implies that the mhd synchronising torque is of the order of @xmath71 dyne cm . if the mass transfer rate is not much higher than @xmath72  g  s@xmath10 , the mhd synchronising torque is several order of magnitudes greater than the accreting torque ( equation [ acctorque ] ) and is able to ensure that the system is in synchronous rotation .",
    "it is worth noting that in deriving equation [ acctorque ] the magnetic field is ignored and the angular momentum is assumed to be transferred from the accretion flow to the star directly .",
    "for a magnetically channeled flow , the interaction between the accretion flow and the star is more complicated .",
    "a recent study ( li , wickramasinghe & rdiger 1996 ) has shown that angular momentum can be transferred from the accretion flow to the star only via the magnetic stress .",
    "in non - synchronously rotating systems , the accretion flow interacts with the magnetic field of the accreting star .",
    "in polars , as the field lines of the two stars are interconnected , the accretion flow interacts magnetically with both stars .",
    "this may allow the angular momentum of the accretion flow to distribute between the two stars and hence to be transferred to the orbit .",
    "thus , equation [ acctorque ] probably overestimates the strength of these first order considerations of the destabilising torque due to accretion .",
    "the synchronism of rx j1914 + 24 is therefore likely to be more stable than expected from a balance between the mhd torque and the conventional accretion torque .      the mass transfer in low mass semi - detached binaries is generally driven by the orbital evolution .",
    "when the orbital angular momentum of a binary decreases , the orbital separation shrinks , causing matter to overflow the roche lobe of the secondary star and accrete onto the primary star .",
    "for short (  3  hr ) period systems , gravitational radiation is an efficient process for angular momentum loss , while for long (  3  hr ) period systems magnetic braking is the dominant process ( eg verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) .",
    "magnetic braking requires the presence of a stellar wind from the secondary star by which the angular momentum is transported . in double - degenerate systems",
    "there is no stellar wind .",
    "magnetic braking therefore can not operate , regardless of the orbital period and whether the system is synchronised or not ( see li , wu & wickramasinghe 1994 ) .",
    "if rx j1914 + 24 is indeed a double degenerate system , then the orbital evolution of rx j1914 + 24 should be solely driven by gravitational radiation .",
    "the mass transfer rate for gravitational - radiation driven orbital evolution is : @xmath73       \\biggl({p_{\\rm orb } \\over { 10~{\\rm min}}}\\biggr)^{-8/3}\\ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( cf faulkner 1971 ; wickramasinghe & wu 1994 ) , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 = 5/6 + @xmath77/2 , where @xmath77 is related by the form @xmath78 . for normal stars , @xmath791 , giving @xmath76=4/3 , while for low mass he white dwarfs , @xmath79 1/3 , giving @xmath802/3 ( nauenberg 1972 ) . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( cf  [ masssec ] ) and an orbital period of 9.5 mins ,",
    "the expected mass transfer rate is @xmath83 for a he white dwarf .",
    "this is consistent with the value ( cropper et al .",
    "1998 ) deduced from the rosat pspc data . as mass transfer in rx j1914 + 24 can not be driven by magnetic braking or nuclear evolution , the agreement between the observed accretion luminosity and predicted mass transfer rate show evidence of the operation of gravitational radiation in close binaries .",
    "we have found the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 . our new optical and x - ray data strengthen the suggestion of cropper et al ( 1998 ) that rx j1914 + 24",
    "is the first known double degenerate polar and has the shortest orbital period of any known binary system .",
    "we suggest that the variation in the @xmath0 band flux is due to the irradiated face of the secondary white dwarf .",
    "the long term x - ray light curve shows a variation in flux of an order of magnitude ( typical of polars ) .",
    "we estimate that the secondary white dwarf has very low mass ( 0.08 ) and the primary white dwarf has a magnetic field strength greater than a few mg . for double degenerate",
    "binaries the dominating synchronising torque is that of mhd interaction between the two stars and the accretion stream while mass transfer is driven solely by gravitational radiation .",
