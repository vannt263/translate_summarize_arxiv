    "the _ hydrodynamic formalism _ was pioneered by landau  @xcite and khalatnikov  @xcite in the context of superfluid helium , and introduced to complex fluids by de gennes  @xcite .",
    "( most physicists take _ hydrodynamics _ to mean the long - wave - length continuum theory of any condensed system , while engineers typically use it as a synonym for the navier - stokes equations . )",
    "the formalism considers energy and momentum conservation simultaneously , and has a tailored set of state variables for each condensed system .",
    "in contrast , the usual approach via _ constitutive relations _ typically leaves out energy conservation and considers the same set of variables for all systems .    in deriving a constitutive relation for a complex fluid ,",
    "one usually focuses on its rheology , and postulates a quantity @xmath0 , as a function of the stress @xmath1 , strain rate @xmath2 , and density @xmath3 , such that the constitutive relation @xmath4 holds .",
    "( @xmath5 needs to be replaced by an objective derivative more generally . ) together with the continuity equation @xmath6 , momentum conservation , @xmath7 , it forms a closed set of equations for @xmath3 , @xmath1 and the velocity @xmath8 , which one may take as the universal set of variables .",
    "the function @xmath0 is specified employing experimental data , of which , usually , only a subset is employed , say elasto - plastic motion in granular media , but then not fast dense flow or elastic waves . even though , in complex systems , it is a difficult approach requiring many arbitrary steps .",
    "this is far better in the hydrodynamic approach . in deriving a theory ,",
    "one first identifies the basic physics of a system , with the help of which a set of state variables is specified .",
    "different complex systems with different underlying physics therefore have different state variables .",
    "then , by considering energy and momentum conservation , in addition to entropy balance , the energy flux and the stress are derived ( not postulated ) , as functions of the state variables and their spatial derivatives , with a clear distinction between dissipative and reactive terms . given the stringency of derivation , therefore , the continuum - mechanical theory thus obtained is the appropriate one for the given system if the input in physics is adequate .",
    "being a subject of practical importance , elasto - plastic deformation of dense granular media has been under the focus of engineering research for many decades if not centuries  @xcite .",
    "the state of the art , however , is confusing : a large number of constitutive models compete , employing strikingly different expressions , with none accepted as authoritative . in his recent book ,",
    "_ physical soil mechanics _  @xcite ,",
    "gudehus uses phrases such as _ morass of equations _ and _ jungle of data _ as metaphors .",
    "moreover , this competition is among theories applicable only to elasto - plastic deformation , while rapid dense flow is taken to obey yet rather different equations  @xcite .",
    "it took us a while to understand , but now we realize that although these theories achieve considerable realism , they are in essence clever renditions of complex data , not reflections of the underlying physics .",
    "this is the reason it appears worthwhile to us trying out the hydrodynamic approach , by focusing on the physics first , leaving the rich and subtle granular phenomenology aside while constructing the theory .",
    "our hope is to arrive at one that , though not necessarily accurate in every aspect , is firmly based in physics , applicable over the complete range of shear rates , and affords a well founded understanding .",
    "hydrodynamic theories  @xcite have been derived for many condensed systems , including liquid crystals  @xcite , superfluid @xmath9he  @xcite , superconductors  @xcite , macroscopic electro - magnetism  @xcite , ferrofluids  @xcite , and polymers  @xcite .",
    "it is useful and possible also for granular media : useful , because it should help to illuminate and order their complex behavior ; possible , because a significant portion has already been done .",
    "we call it gsh , for `` _ granular solid hydrodynamics_. '' remarkably , it divides granular behavior into three regimes , with the granular temperature @xmath10 , or jiggling of the grains , serving as a dial :    1 .   at @xmath11 , grains hardly jiggle , implying vanishing shear rates @xmath12 : static stress distribution and the propagation of elastic waves are phenomena of this regime .",
    "we call it _ quasi - elastic _ because the stress stems from deformed grains and is elastic in origin , and because the terms responsible for plastic behavior are quadratically small .",
    "2 .   at slightly elevated @xmath10 and slow",
    "rates : the stress is still predominantly elastic , but it may now relax : when the grains loose ( or loosen ) contact with one another , both granular deformation and the associated stress will decrease .",
    "the plastic terms are now comparable to the elastic ones .",
    "typical phenomena are the _ critical state _  @xcite and _ incremental nonlinearity _ ( ie . the strikingly different loading and unloading curves ) , not seen in the quasi - elastic regime .",
    "the hypoplastic model  @xcite and other rate - independent constitutive relations hold here .",
    "we call it the _ hypoplastic regime _  without implying the lack of potentials as originally thought .",
    "3 .   at large @xmath10 and high shear rates",
    ", we have the rapid dense flow behavior covered by the @xmath13-model  @xcite and bagnold flow .",
    "the jiggling is so strong that it exerts a pressure , and viscosities are important .",
    "they compete with the elastic stress , becoming dominant at high rates and low densities .",
    "finally , some words on the difference between the structure and parameters of a theory : the first concerns the part that is derived from general principles , the second is a material - dependent input , typically an assumption .",
    "this difference is especially clear - cut in constitutive models , where the structure is given by the laws of mass and momentum conservation , and the parameter is given by @xmath0 . in a hydrodynamic theory , the structure consists of ( 1 )  the conservation laws for energy , momentum and mass , and ( 2 ) their respective fluxes , given as functions of the state and conjugate variables ( eg .",
    "entropy @xmath14 and temperature @xmath15 ) , including their spacial derivatives ( eg .",
    "@xmath16 ) . in this form ,",
    "the fluxes are generally valid .",
    "the most important parameter is the expressions for the energy @xmath17 .",
    "once given , the conjugate variables , and with them also the fluxes , are explicit functions of the state variables .",
    "transport coefficients ( eg . the viscosity ) are also parameters . ideally , one would like to obtained the parameters from a microscopic theory , though this is a tall order accomplished mainly in dilute systems ( or formally dilute ones ) . for denser ones ,",
    "the realistic approach is to engage in a trial - and - error iteration , in which the ramification of postulated dependences are compared to experiments and simulations .",
    "the structure of gsh is , we believe , complete and adequate , but the parameters are not as yet specified with complete confidence .",
    "the main reason is , although the dependency of the transport coefficients on the granular temperature @xmath10 seems fairly universal , obtainable from more general considerations , that on the density varies with the type of grains .",
    "and this system - specific information needs to be obtained from data on only one type of grains .",
    "( in a sense , the @xmath10-dependence is more _",
    "structural_. )    in what follows , we shall first discuss the basic physics of granular media in sec  [ intro-3 ] , then present the equations of gsh in sec  [ gsh ] .",
    "the next two sections are respectively devoted to granular behavior in the quasi - elastic and hypoplastic regime , as defined above .",
    "( application of gsh to fast dense flow of regime 3 is in  . )",
    "the manuscript ends with a conclusion and a list of symbols .",
    "to derive the hydrodynamic theory for granular media , one needs the input of what the essence of granular physics is .",
    "we believe it is encapsulated by two notions : _ two - stage irreversibility _ and _ variable transient elasticity_. the first is related to the three spatial scales of any granular media : ( a )  the macroscopic , ( b )  the mesoscopic , granular , and ( c )  the microscopic , inner granular . dividing all degrees of freedom ( dof ) into these three categories , we treat those of ( a ) differently from ( b , c ) .",
    "macroscopic dof : the slowly varying stress , flow and density fields , are employed as state variables , but inter- and inner granular dof are treated summarily : only their contributions to the energy is considered and taken , respectively , as granular and true heat .",
    "so we do not account for the motion of a jiggling grain , only include its fluctuating kinetic and elastic energy as contributions to the granular heat , @xmath18 , characterized by the granular entropy @xmath19 and temperature @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , phonons are taken as part of true heat , @xmath20 .",
    "there are a handful of macroscopic dof  ( a ) , a large number of granular ones ( b ) , and yet many orders of magnitude more inner granular ones ( c ) .",
    "so the statistical tendency to equally distribute the energy among all dof implies an energy decay : ( a ) @xmath21 ( b , c ) and ( b ) @xmath21 ( c ) .",
    "this is what we call _ two - stage irreversibility _ , see fig  [ 2stageirr ]     _ two - stage irreversibility_. dissipative processeses produce either granular entropy @xmath19 , or directly thermal entropy @xmath22 .",
    "eventually , @xmath19 is also converted to @xmath22 . ]",
    "the system is in equilibrium if the true entropy @xmath22 is maximal .",
    "maximal @xmath19 would characterize a quasi - equilibrium only if there were no energy decay from ( a , b ) to ( c ) , or when it is slow enough to be neglected . as the ubiquitous inelasticity of granular collisions",
    "demonstrate , this is never the case .",
    "a division into three scales works well when they are clearly separated  though this is a problem of accuracy , not viability .",
    "scale separation is well satisfied in large - scaled , engineering - type experiments , but less so in small - scaled ones .",
    "using glass or steel beads aggravates the problem .",
    "the same is true of 2d experiments employing less and larger disks . on the other hand ,",
    "when there is too little space for spatial averaging , one may still average over time and runs , to get rid of fluctuations not contained in a hydrodyanmic theory .",
    "thermodynamic variables are , strictly speaking , either conserved ones , such as energy and mass , or broken symmetry ones , such as the preferred direction in nematic liquid crystals .",
    "but one can conveniently include slowly relaxing variables in an appropriately generalized thermodynamic theory .",
    "a well known example for such variables is the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath24 in a ginzburg - landau theory , such as the superfluid density @xmath25  @xcite . expanding the free energy in @xmath24 at the phase transition , one obtains @xmath26 , with equilibrium given for minimal @xmath27 , or @xmath28 .",
    "circumstances are especially simple for @xmath29 , when the term @xmath30 is negligible , and @xmath31 the equilibrium condition .",
    "the idea behind this is a generalized notion of equilibrium  call it _ quasi - equilibrium _  from one in which @xmath24 vanishes to one with a given value of @xmath24 .",
    "the associated statistical ensemble includes only the micro - states compatible with this value .",
    "these are not as numerous as those with @xmath31 , but more than sufficient for the consideration to hold , that quasi - equilibrium is the macro - state with the largest number of compatible micro - states . any thermodynamic consideration that derives from it remains well founded , especially the principle of maximal entropy . as a result ,",
    "the conjugate variables retain their thermodynamic significance : for instance , @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 the energy and @xmath34 the volume ) is the equilibrium force for given @xmath24 .    conserved and relaxing variables have different equilibrium conditions .",
    "the latter assumes a specific value ( frequently zero , and more generally given by the vanishing of the conjugate variable , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the former does not , though the associated conjugate variable is constant .",
    "for instance , the equilibrium condition with respect to energy exchange between two systems is equal temperatures , @xmath36 , and to mass exchange equal chemical potentials , @xmath37 .",
    "curiously , @xmath10 alternates between both types of behavior .    before we enter into its discussion , a caveat and a note .",
    "writing @xmath18 for the energy contained in the granular dof is useful only if they are in equilibrium with one another .",
    "this may not always be the case , eg .",
    "in a granular gas maintained by vibrating walls .",
    "( the system therefore needs additional state variables to characterize the velocity distribution , see  . ) but grains are increasingly better equilibrated for higher densities and more frequent collisions . to keep the discussion simple",
    ", we assume that they are always in equilibrium . the note : static granular ensembles are always in ( a properly understood ) thermodynamic equilibrium . both the force equilibrium and @xmath38 are results of maximizing the total entropy , see sec  [ equicond ] .    in a rarefied granular gas",
    ", the energy @xmath33 has only kinetic contributions .",
    "equipartion implies we have @xmath39 per dof , or @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 the number of grains ) . assuming that the inner granular dof may be modeled as a phonon gas , we take its energy as @xmath42 ( for @xmath43 , the debye temperature , and @xmath44 the number of atoms in all the grains ) . if the grains maintained their mechanical integrity at arbitrarily high @xmath45 , they will heat up during a collision for @xmath46 , but cool down for @xmath47 ( by amplifying the brownian motion ) , until they are in equilibrium , for @xmath38 .",
    "clearly , all this results from @xmath10 being associated with the conserved energy ( or equivalently , with the `` conserved '' entropy while minimizing the energy ) . usually , of course ,",
    "because @xmath48 , the heat transfer is taken as independent of @xmath45 , given by a constant restitution coefficient .",
    "it then relaxes , like @xmath24 , until it vanishes .",
    "since the grains collide more frequently at higher densities , increasing the elastic contribution to the energy , this simple picture gets blurred , breaking down completely when the contacts become enduring . given the complicated interaction between grains at higher densities , including dissipation and friction , a valid @xmath49 with @xmath50 seems difficult to obtain head - on .",
    "therefore , we choose the following pragmatic approach . starting from the energy density as a function of the two entropy densities , @xmath51",
    ", we write @xmath52 , identifying the first term as the equilibrium energy for @xmath38 , and the second as the additional contribution @xmath53 if @xmath54 . written this way ,",
    "@xmath45 is associated with the conserved total entropy @xmath55 .",
    "it does not have a definite equilibrium value , but will equalize with the temperature of another system if heat exchange is allowed .",
    "associated with @xmath56 at given @xmath57 , @xmath58 is an internal excitation of a non - optimal energy distribution , akin to mass nonuniformity ( that will relax if uniform mass is the equilibrium state , because mass conservation does not come in here ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 relaxes until @xmath59 . using the same arguments",
    "as employed for the ginzburg - landau free energy , that the energy @xmath60 has a minimum for @xmath59 , we expand @xmath53 to find @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "as this consideration assumes only analyticity of @xmath17 and does not depend on the interaction , it is quite general .",
    "so eq  ( [ 2b-1 ] ) should hold for @xmath10 sufficiently small , and the remaining question is what @xmath63 is .",
    "first , we note that taking the dimension of @xmath64 as energy and inverse volume , respectively , that of @xmath65 is volume@xmath66energy .",
    "next , having established the quadratic dependence ( surprising as we are used to @xmath67 ) , we may now take the realistic limit , @xmath48 , @xmath68 , to realize that the above rewriting of @xmath69 did not change much , since @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "but we now do know that @xmath45 is associated with a conserved variable , while @xmath10 is , _ cum grano salis _ , a relaxing one .",
    "and we may consider @xmath72 .    as remarked at the end of the introduction ,",
    "density dependence is a system - specific property , that needs to be obtained from experiments or simulation .",
    "we note that a gas of light - weight and completely elastic beads may serve as a _ granular thermometer _ in a dem - experiment for a regular granular system comprising of dissipative , heavy grains , if both are separated by a massless membrane ( that will transmit momentum but no particles ) .",
    "maintaining the regular system at @xmath73 const , where @xmath74 , one can measure its energy @xmath75 , both the kinetic and the elastic contributions , and read its temperature @xmath76 off the thermometer . combining both yields @xmath77 , or @xmath78 via an expansion of @xmath17 in @xmath10 .",
    "this procedure works mainly because waiting long enough , the thermometer will equilibrate with the grains , irrespective how dissipative they are .",
    "the many reasons a real experiment would not work is of course related to the conclusion we draw above that @xmath10 is primarily a relaxing quantity that seeks to attain its local equilibrium value , irrespective whether there is another system of a different @xmath10 , with which energy may be exchanged . given this lack of circumstances in which the thermodynamic significance of @xmath10 plays any robust role , it seems futile to insist on it .",
    "so , instead of measuring @xmath63 via @xmath10 s thermodynamic significance , we may employ eqs  ( [ 2b-1 ] ) , with a postulate @xmath78 [ such as given in eqs  ( [ 2b-5 ] ) below ] , to define @xmath10 , such that it holds for all @xmath79 .",
    "although @xmath10 is then a true temperature only at @xmath38 , this strategy works surprisingly well , not only for elasto - plastic motion in dense media , but also for gases . in gsh ,",
    "the pressure exerted by jiggling grains is @xmath80 , the viscosity @xmath81 , see eq  ( [ 2b-5 ] , [ 2c-3 ] ) below . equating @xmath82 to @xmath83 for granular gases , we obtain @xmath84 and indeed , the pressure is found @xmath85 , the viscosity @xmath86 , in an approach combining the kinetic theory and dem results  @xcite .",
    "finally , it seems useful to probe whether one may identify @xmath10 with the average velocity @xmath87 . taking the energy density of the granular dof as @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath89 in the dilute limit , and may plausibly take @xmath90 approaching 2 in the dense limit , where enduring contacts dominate , hence any kinetic energy is converted into elastic one at the next instance , and back again .",
    "however , this conjecture , conveniently linking a macroscopic to a mesoscopic quantity , needs to be thoroughly validated .      our second notion , _ variable transient elasticity _ , addresses granular plasticity . the free surface of a granular system at rest is frequently tilted .",
    "when perturbed , when the grains jiggle and @xmath91 , the tilted surface will decay and become horizontal .",
    "the stronger the grains jiggle and slide , the faster the decay is .",
    "we take this as indicative of a system that is elastic for @xmath92 , transiently elastic for @xmath91 , with a stress relaxation rate @xmath81 .",
    "a relaxing stress is typical of any viscous - elastic system such as polymers  @xcite .",
    "the unique circumstance here is that the relaxation rate is not a material constant , but a function of the state variable @xmath10 .",
    "as we shall see , it is this _ variable transient elasticity _  a simple fact at heart  that underlies the complex behavior of granular plasticity . realizing it yields a most economic way to capture granular rheology at elasto - plastic rates .    employing a strain field rather than the stress as a state variable usually yields a simpler description , because the former is in essence a geometric quantity , the latter a physical one  compare the evolution equations for both .",
    "yet one can not use the standard strain field @xmath93 as a granular state variable , because the relation between stress and @xmath93 lacks uniqueness when the system is plastic .",
    "engineering theories frequently divide the strain into two fields , elastic @xmath94 and plastic @xmath95 , with the first accounting for the reversible and second for the irreversible part .",
    "they then employ @xmath93 and @xmath95 as two independent strain fields to account for elasto - plastic motion of granular media  @xcite .",
    "we believe that , on the contrary , the elastic strain @xmath94 is the sole state variable , as there is a unique relation between the elastic stress @xmath96 and @xmath94 , as convincingly argued by rubin  @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath94 as the portion of the strain that deforms the grains and changes the energy @xmath97 . and",
    "since an elastic stress @xmath96 only exists when the grains are deformed , it is also a function of @xmath94 . employing @xmath94 as the sole state variable preserves many useful features of elasticity , especially the ( so - called hyper - elastic ) relation , @xmath98 this",
    "is derived in  @xcite but easy to understand via an analogy .",
    "the wheels of a car driving up a snowy hill will grip the ground part of the time , slipping otherwise . when the wheels grip , the car moves and its gravitational energy @xmath17 is increased . dividing the wheel",
    "s rotation @xmath99 into a gripping @xmath100 and a slipping @xmath101 portion , we may compute the torque on the wheel as @xmath102 ( if the wheel turns sufficiently slowly ) , same as in eq  ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "how much the wheel turns or slips , how large @xmath99 or @xmath101 are , is irrelevant for the torque .",
    "although @xmath93 is not a state variable , there are effects of the rates that need to be included : given a shear rate @xmath12 , the grains will jiggle and slide , producing a finite @xmath10 . this effect",
    "is included in the balance equation for @xmath10 , which accounts for the energy decay from ( a ) to ( b ) .",
    "it has two steady - state limits , @xmath103 for low shear rates , and @xmath104 for higher ones .",
    "the only way to find out whether _ two - stage irreversibility _ and _ variable transient elasticity _ are appropriate and sufficient , is to derived the theory and compare its ramifications with experiments .",
    "the structure of the theory ( that we call gsh ) has already been derived , see  @xcite , though it was written such that the formal derivation is stressed , not the results , making them less accessible .",
    "and there were some blanks left , especially the density dependence of the transport coefficients , and the dependence of the elastic energy on the third invariant .",
    "all results are presented here in a readable way , and with the blanks filled in as far as possible .",
    "the second step , finding the ramifications , is a more lengthy process , in the midst of which we are .",
    "gsh is derived employing conventional methods of theoretical physics , assuming thermodynamic considerations and associated general principles , especially the onsager relation , are valid in granular media . as some in the community do not subscribe to it ( possibly following kadanoff  @xcite , who conjectured early on that granular media , being unique",
    ", may not have a hydrodynamic theory ) , we lay out our reasons why we believe granular media are not different to the extend as to actually violate general principles .",
    "first , we distinguish between a _",
    "general principle _ and an analogy .",
    "the first has been proven to hold under general conditions , hence the name ; the second may be good or bad , though no basic result of theoretical physics is imperiled whatever its validity .",
    "for instance , there are two versions of the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ in granular media , one in terms of the true temperature @xmath45 , the other in terms of the granular temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the former is a general principle that is equally applicable to gas , a block of copper and a pile of sand , quantifying how much , eg . the volume of each fluctuates .",
    "the latter derives from the analogy between @xmath10 and @xmath45 , and has been shown to be invalid at times  hardly surprising , since the analogy is far from perfect .",
    "similarly , while energy is frequently deemed not to be conserved in granular media , it is in fact only the kinetic energy of the grains that is not conserved . the total energy , including the heat in the grains , of course is .",
    "then there is the argument  @xcite that since grains collide inelastically and execute irreversible motion , and since the validity of the onsager relation depends on the _ time reversal invariance _ of the underlying microscopic dynamics , the onsager relation does not hold in granular media .",
    "this argument is not convincing  the fact that _ granular kinetic theory is irreversible because it is mesoscopic _ has been overlooked here .",
    "the true microscopic dynamics in sand is , as everywhere else , the reversible schrdinger equation for the constituent atoms .",
    "it is a deeply held belief in theoretical physics that all systems obey cpt - invariance . in condensed matter , with only electromagnetic interaction",
    ", t - invariance holds .",
    "this is the foundation of the onsager relation , a general principle , see eg .",
    "the proof in  @xcite .",
    "the specificity of the system , or the theory one happens to employ , are irrelevant for its validity .",
    "another argument states that , since a sand pile has much more gravitational energy than a monolayer of grains , only the latter , the minimal energy state , is in equilibrium .",
    "the former , being `` _ jammed _ '' and prevented to reach the latter , is too far off equilibrium for thermodynamics to hold .",
    "we contend that one needs to first also include in the consideration the elastic energy ; and second , to realize that a stuck piston , positioned between two chambers of air , is also `` jammed . ''",
    "yet this is a system in equilibrium because all its many degrees of freedom are except one : the position of the piston that upholds a _ constraint _ on the volumes of the two subsystems .",
    "thermodynamics is routinely applied to such a system . in a macroscopic body ,",
    "all elastic dof are in equilibrium if the force balance holds , implying the sum of gravitational and elastic energy is minimal , see sec.[equicond ] .",
    "two elastic bodies , one on top of another , are also in equilibrium if the sum of their energy is minimal  though there is the constraint that the upper body must not slide with respect to the lower one .",
    "a sand pile is many little elastic bodies on top of one another .",
    "if they are constrained to stay put , and their total energy is minimal , the pile is in equilibrium and amenable to thermodynamic considerations .",
    "the expressions of gsh are divided into the static and dynamic parts .",
    "* statics * includes the state variables , the formal equilibrium conditions in terms of them , and the expression for the thermodynamic energy .",
    "we also discuss the convexity transition of the energy , how it accounts for yield surfaces in the variable space , beyond which no elastic solutions remain stable .",
    "we note that it is qualitatively different from the yield - like critical state , one being a static , the other a dynamic , phenomenon . *",
    "dynamics * includes conservation laws , balance equations for @xmath56 and @xmath14 , and evolution equations for the rest of the state variables .",
    "explicit expressions for the transport coefficients , the energy flux and the cauchy stress are given .",
    "in accordance to the above stated understanding of granular media s basic physics , the state variables are : the granular entropy @xmath56 and the elastic strain @xmath94 , in addition to the usual variables : the density @xmath105 , the momentum density @xmath106 , the true entropy @xmath14 . denoting the energy density ( in the rest frame , @xmath107 ) as @xmath108 ,",
    "the conjugate variables are : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the chemical potential , @xmath45 the temperature , @xmath10 the granular temperature , and @xmath96 the elastic stress .",
    "these are given once the energy @xmath17 is .",
    "next , in sec  [ equicond ] , equilibrium conditions will be derived formally , in terms of the energy and its conjugate variables , whatever @xmath17 is",
    ". then , in sec  [ granen ] , an example for @xmath17 will be given , and the conjugate variables calculated  with the help of which the equilibrium conditions are rendered explicit .",
    "a complete set of state variables is one that determines a unique macroscopic state of the system .",
    "if a set is given , there is no room for ambiguity , for  history- \" or  preparation - dependence .",
    "\" conversely , any such dependence indicates that the set is incomplete . in the hydrodynamic approach ,",
    "a physical quantity is a state variable if ( and only if ) the energy @xmath17 depends on it .",
    "our assumption is that the above set is complete .",
    "equilibrium conditions for the state variables , usually in terms of their conjugate variables , are obtained by requiring the entropy @xmath111 to be maximal with appropriate constraints : constant energy @xmath112 , constant mass @xmath113 . in granular media ,",
    "remarkably , this universally valid procedure leads to two distinct sets of equilibrium conditions , the solid- and the fluid - like one . maximizing the entropy ( see  @xcite for details ) , we first obtain the condition of uniform true temperature @xmath114 , and the requirement that the granular temperature vanishes , @xmath92 .",
    "usually , @xmath10 vanishes quickly , and if it does , the density is not independent from the elastic strain , @xmath115 .",
    "they share a common condition that we identify as the solid one , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the gravitational constant , @xmath96 the elastic stress , @xmath118 the usual expression for the fluid pressure , and @xmath34 the volume .",
    "( the derivative is taken at constant @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . ) with the energy expression @xmath17 of the next sec  [ granen ] , @xmath122 is the pressure exerted by jiggling grains .",
    "we therefore call it the _ seismic pressure _  @xcite .",
    "clearly , equilibrium condition eq  ( [ 2a-1 ] ) , expressing force balance , is logically the result of maximal true entropy .",
    "if @xmath10 is kept finite by external perturbations , the system may further increase its entropy by independently varying @xmath105 and @xmath94 , to arrive at the fluid equilibrium .",

    "the two yield stresses are frequently similar in magnitude , which is probably related to the fact that both account for the clearance with the profile of the underlying layer , though one with granular jiggling , @xmath149 , and hence a little easier .",

    ", this rate - independence is a reflection of the fact that reactive and dissipative terms have the same frequency dependence , and are comparable in size  they are exactly equal in the critical state .",
    "if there were only the hypoplastic regime , elastic waves would always be overdamped .",
    "since this is not the case , there must be a different rate - independent but dissipation - free regime .",
    "faced with this dilemma , a frequent suggestion is to take a small incremental strain ( such as given in an elastic wave ) to be elastic and free of dissipation , but a large one as elasto - plastic and dissipative . for the following reason , we believe this is incompatible with the notion of a quasi - static motion , and the wrong way out : starting from a static state of given stress , and applying a small incremental strain that is elastic",
    ", the system is again in a static state and an equally valid starting point",
    ". the next small increment must therefore also be purely elastic .",
    "many consecutive small increments yield a large change in strain , and if the small ones are not dissipative , neither can their sum be .    in gsh , it is the strain rate , not its amplitude , that decides whether the system is elastic or hypoplastic .",
    "small strain increments achieved with a high but short lasting shear rate will provoke an elastic response , if @xmath10 does not have time to get to a sufficiently high value to induce any plastic responses .",
    "furthermore , the mere existence of a quasi - static , quasi - elastic regime does not imply that it is also easily observable , though see sec  [ soft springs ] .",
    "finally , we note that backtracing of the stress curve @xmath316 when reversing the strain , @xmath317 , occurs only in the quasi - elastic regime , not the hypoplastic one .",

    "this is what we believe the main reason why there are so many competing engineering models . as this liberty explodes",
    "when one includes gradient terms , most models refrain from the attempt to account for nonuniform situations , say elastic waves .",
    "second , in dispensing with the variables @xmath10 and @xmath94 , and restricting the variables to @xmath380 , one reduces the model s range of validity and looses the benefit of @xmath94 s simple behavior : first , the models of hypoplasticity and barodesy are valid only for @xmath293 , so a @xmath10 that is either too small or oscillates too fast will invalidate them .",
    "second , as the analytical solution of the approach to the critical state  @xcite shows , considering @xmath94  though it is not directly measurable  is a highly simplifying intermediate step .",
    "the case for @xmath94 is even stronger , when considering proportional paths and the barodesy model , see below .",
    "the _ hypoplastic model _ starts from the rate - independent constitutive relation , @xmath381 postulated by kolymbas  @xcite , where @xmath382 are ( fairly involved ) functions of the stress and packing fraction .",
