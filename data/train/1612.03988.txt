    "a large body of quantum optimal control simulations and experiments @xcite involve tailored electromagnetic fields acting on atoms or molecules to control a specified physical and/or chemical process , frequently accompanied by optimization of the performance of the control field @xcite . aiming to explain the widely observed experimental successes along with much larger numbers of almost perfect optimal control simulations , rigorous analyses were made in the past decade on the _ quantum control landscape _",
    ", herein defined as the expectation value of a desired system observable as a function(al ) of the control @xcite . the landscape topology is important for establishing the feasibility of finding globally optimal controls , especially when myopic algorithms ( e.g. , gradient ascent / descent ) are employed .",
    "a central concern is the properties of control landscape _",
    "critical points _ , where the landscape gradient with respect to the control is zero .",
    "of particular importance is the appearance of suboptimal local extrema as _ traps _ , which could halt a gradient search and prevent reaching the global optimum .",
    "a general control problem involves a physical system and a control that steers the system s dynamics . both the system and the control can be either classical or quantum mechanical in nature , giving a tetrad of control scenarios : c - c ( a classical system steered by a classical control ) , q - c ( a quantum system steered by a classical control ) , c - q ( a classical system steered by a quantum control ) , and q - q ( a quantum system steered by another quantum control ) .",
    "most control studies , as well as the associated landscape analyses , are expressed in the _ semiclassical _ framework , i.e. , the q - c scenario .",
    "it has been proved that with unconstrained classical control fields , the landscape for a controllable finite - level quantum system is expected to be free of any local suboptima , with all critical points being the global maximum or minimum , or possibly _ saddle _ points @xcite .",
    "inclusion of classical field constraints , for example , on the pulse amplitude , bandwidth , and length , may result in additional topological features on the landscape , including possibly traps @xcite .",
    "the origins of the rare traps without field constraints and the frequent presence of saddles have remained a mystery .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the q - q control landscape by taking a full quantum perspective .",
    "suppose that a quantum system @xmath0 ( herein the system ) is controlled by another quantum system @xmath1 ( the _ control _ ) , which can be arbitrarily manipulated by suitable means @xcite . in principle , both quantum systems may take many forms including quantized radiation fields in an optical cavity @xcite as demonstrated by few - photon pulses in a recent experiment @xcite , bulk material systems , spins , etc .",
    ", forming a diverse picture of q - q control scenarios . in this work the control",
    "is realized by the initial density matrix of the quantized control @xmath1 coupled with the system @xmath0 , in contrast to the semiclassical q - c perspective of time - domain fields serving as the controls directly acting on quantum system @xmath0 .",
    "we will demonstrate that the landscape expressed in the q - q context is _ convex _ , thus rigorously free of any local traps or saddles without requiring any auxiliary assumptions .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the q - q optimal solution can be directly calculated from the eigenvectors of a specified operator matrix encapsulating all relevant physical information .",
    "the landscape study in this work subsumes so - called incoherent control @xcite .",
    "this work primarily explores the q - q landscape for fundamental insights , including the distinction evident from that of the q - c landscape .",
    "practical laboratory implementation of q - q control is understood to call for a detailed assessment of each particular scenario , which is beyond the scope of the present work . as a remark , at present time q - c control offers the easiest laboratory scenario but there are already example of q - q control pointed out above .",
    "the remainder of this paper will be organized as follows . in section [ sec : def ] , the q - q control landscape is defined and proved to be convex . in section [ sec : sol ] , the properties of the resulting convex optimization problem are analyzed , and section [ sec : exp ] presents an example using the jaynes - cummings model as an illustration . finally , concluding remarks are made in section [ sec : con ]",
    "in the semiclassical q - c scenario , the _ kinematic _ control landscape of the observable @xmath2 for a closed @xmath3-level quantum system @xmath0 controlled by an external classical field @xmath4 over the duration @xmath5 has the _ cost function _ @xmath6={\\rm tr}[u_{\\rm sc}(t)\\rho_a(0)u_{\\rm sc}^\\dag(t)o_a],\\ ] ] where the propagator @xmath7 ( i.e. , with the label ` sc ' referring to semiclassical ) belongs to the unitary group u(@xmath3 ) designated as the kinematic control space , and @xmath8 is the initial density matrix of @xmath0",
    ". it has been shown that the topology of @xmath9 $ ] is equivalent to that of the corresponding _ dynamical _ landscape @xmath10 $ ] , as a functional of the control field @xmath4 , upon satisfaction of three assumptions : ( i ) the system is _ controllable _ @xcite , ( ii ) the local mapping @xmath11 bridging the kinematic and dynamical landscapes is _ surjective _ at any control @xcite , and ( iii ) the control fields @xmath4 are unconstrained , or in practice have sufficient freedom to exploit assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) @xcite .",
    "the landscape topology based on these assumptions have been the focus of many previous studies @xcite .",
    "we remark that assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be shown as being `` almost always '' satisfied @xcite , consistent with the semiclassical landscape rarely exhibiting traps , while at most only non - trapping saddles .    in the q - q scenario ,",
    "the total hamiltonian of the composite system @xmath12 is time - independent and can be generally expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the identity operator in the hilbert space of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the respective uncoupled hamiltonian of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the interaction hamiltonians associated with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . assuming the composite system @xmath12 to be closed ,",
    "the total unitary propagator produced by the constant hamiltonian is simply @xmath20 .",
    "one way of making the semiclassical approximation from this formulation is to treat @xmath18 as the control hamiltonians of the system @xmath0 , and the expectation values of @xmath19 in the control @xmath1 as the corresponding classical fields @xcite .",
    "the q - q control objective , parallel to that of the semiclassical case , aims to optimize the expectation value of an observable @xmath2 at time @xmath5 , initially given the state of @xmath0 as @xmath21 . the composite system @xmath12 initially may be prepared ( i ) in a _ separable _",
    "state @xmath22 at @xmath23 , with @xmath21 being a counterpart of @xmath8 in eq . and",
    "@xmath24 the initial state of the control @xmath1 ; or ( ii ) in an entangled initial state @xmath25 with the additional constraint that @xmath26 , i.e. , the reduced density matrix of @xmath0 is still @xmath21 .",
    "once the initial state is created , @xmath0 and @xmath1 will freely evolve together under the total hamiltonian @xmath27 and generally become entangled .",
    "the control scheme analyzed here will be feasible if the control @xmath1 can be prepared at a specified quantum state @xcite , prior to its interaction with the system @xmath0 .",
    "this scenario can be understood in the context of quantum metrology where the initial quantum state of the probe is selected for improving the precision of measurement @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a separable initial state @xmath28 , the landscape in the q - q formulation can be defined as @xmath29 & = & { \\rm tr}[u_{ab}(t)(\\rho_a\\otimes\\rho_b)u_{ab}^\\dag(t)(o_a\\otimes\\mathbb{i}_b)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the control @xmath24 is a positive semidefinite matrix of trace one . here",
    "we note that @xmath30 can be further written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "optimization of the corresponding landscape can be posed as a semidefinite programming problem : @xmath33 \\nonumber \\\\ & { \\mbox{\\rm subject to : } } & { \\rm tr}\\rho_b = 1 , \\rho_b\\succeq0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eqs . and , we note that ( 1 ) the cost function @xmath34 is _ linear _ with respect to the control variable @xmath24 , thus both convex and concave , and ( 2 ) the admissible set of @xmath24 is a closed convex set . the condition ( 2 ) can be understood as follows : a linear combination of arbitrary density matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 with nonnegative coefficients @xmath37 that sum to 1 , must satisfy that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , thus still being a physically allowed density matrix .",
    "the convexity of @xmath24 may be violated by additional restrictions on the available initial states of the control @xmath1 , whose analysis is left for future studies .    with the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above , and from the theory of convex optimization @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that the landscape @xmath40 $ ] is trap - free , i.e. , a local maximum or minimum must also be a global one , if the admissible @xmath24 form a convex set . specifically , for a local minimum @xmath41 of the function @xmath40 $ ] and an arbitrary @xmath42 , the convex combination @xmath43 with @xmath44 is within the neighborhood of @xmath41 , thus @xmath45 & \\le & j_q[(1-\\lambda)\\rho_b^\\ast + \\lambda\\rho_b ' ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( 1-\\lambda)j_q[\\rho_b^\\ast ] + \\lambda j_q[\\rho_b'],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which immediately leads to the relation @xmath46",
    "\\le j_q[\\rho_b']$ ] , so @xmath41 must also be a global minimum . similarly it can be proved that a local maximum of @xmath40 $ ] is also a global maximum .    by the linearity of the function @xmath34 , we further find that all _ level sets _ of the q - q landscape must also be convex sets , and thus must be _",
    "connected_. a _ level set _",
    "is defined by the set of all controls with an identical cost function value , whose topology ( especially the _ connectivity _ ) was studied in the semiclassical formulation in ref . @xcite . by the linearity of the function @xmath34",
    ", we further find that all level sets of the q - q landscape are connected , as shown below .",
    "given two initial states @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the control @xmath1 which are on the same level set of the q - q landscape , i.e. , @xmath49 = j_q[\\rho_{b,2 } ] = j_0 $ ] , then any convex combination of @xmath47 and @xmath48 will also be on the level set at @xmath50 since @xmath34 is a linear function of @xmath24 , @xmath51 = \\lambda j_q[\\rho_{b,1 } ] + ( 1-\\lambda)j_q[\\rho_{b,2 } ] =   \\lambda j_0 + ( 1-\\lambda)j_0 = j_0 , \\indent \\lambda\\in[0,1].\\ ] ] therefore , the level set @xmath52 = j_0\\}$ ] for any reachable @xmath50 value must be a convex set , and thus connected .    the simple convexity of the control landscape @xmath34 , eq . , in the q - q formulation",
    "is in sharp contrast to the semiclassical counterpart @xmath53 , eq . , which is a highly nonlinear functional of the control field @xmath4 .",
    "the control landscape features in these two different formulations are summarized in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "note that there is no controllability @xcite requirement for the q - q landscape to be trap - free , which is unnecessary for convexity of the admissible set of the control @xmath24 , or the cost function @xmath34 .",
    "however , the forms of hamiltonians @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq . , the flexibility in creating @xmath24 , as well as the choice of final time @xmath5 can influence the optimal value of @xmath34 reachable in the q - q control scenario .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive analysis of the landscape for full quantum - quantum control associated with the expectation value of an arbitrary observable of one quantum system controlled by another quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that such full quantum - quantum control landscapes are convex , and hence devoid of local suboptima and saddle points that may exist in landscapes for quantum systems controlled by time - dependent classical fields . </S>",
    "<S> there is no controllability requirement for the full quantum - quantum landscape to be trap - free , although the forms of hamiltonians , the flexibility in choosing initial state of the controller , as well as the control duration , can infulence the reachable optimal value on the landscape . </S>",
    "<S> all level sets of the full quantum - quantum landscape are connected convex sets . finally , we show that the optimal solution of the full quantum - quantum control landscape can be readily determined numerically , which is demonstrated using the jaynes - cummings model depicting a two - level atom interacting with a quantized radiation field . </S>"
