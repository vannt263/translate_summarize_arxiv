    "the term _ equisingularity _ has various connotations .",
    "common to these is the idea of stratifying an algebraic or analytic @xmath4-variety  @xmath1 in such a way that along each stratum the points are , as singularities of  @xmath5 , equivalent in some pleasing sense , and somehow get worse as one passes from a stratum to its boundary .",
    "a stratification of  @xmath1 is among other things a partition into a locally finite family of submanifolds , the strata ( see  2 ) , so that whatever `` equivalence '' is taken to mean , there should be , locally on  @xmath5 , only finitely many equivalence classes of singularities .",
    "the purpose , mainly expository and speculative , of this paper  an outgrowth of a survey lecture at the september 1997 obergurgl working week  is to indicate some ( not all ) of the efforts that have been made to interpret equisingularity , and connections among them ; and to suggest directions for further exploration .",
    "\\(a ) the surface  @xmath1 in  @xmath6 given by the equation @xmath7 has singular locus @xmath8 ( the @xmath9-axis ) , along which it has multiplicity  2 except at the origin  @xmath10 , where it has multiplicity 3 .",
    "so there is something quite special about  @xmath10 . interpreting @xmath1 along @xmath11 as a family of curve germs in the @xmath12-plane , with parameter  @xmath9 ,",
    "makes it plausible that the equisingular strata ought to be @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "changing coordinates changes the family , but not the generic member , and not the fact that something special happens at the origin .",
    "\\(b ) replacing @xmath16 by @xmath17 , we get multiplicity 2 everywhere along  @xmath11 , including  @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding family of plane curve germs consists of a pair of intersecting lines degenerating to a double line ; so there is still something markedly special about @xmath10a feeling reinforced by the following picture .",
    "= 2.9 in    this indicates that equimultiplicity along  @xmath11 , while presumably _ necessary _ , is _ not sufficient _ for equisingularity .",
    "\\(c ) the surface @xmath18 , along its singular locus @xmath19 , can be regarded as a family of plane - curve germs all of which look topologically the same , namely four distinct lines through a point .",
    "thus we have _ topological equisingularity _ along @xmath11 .",
    "( in this example the homeomorphisms involved can even be made _ bi - lipschitz ; _ see @xcite for more on lipschitz equisingularity . ) from this point of view , the equisingular strata should be @xmath13 and @xmath11 . however , from the analytic  or even differentiable  point of view , all these germs are distinct , since the cross - ratio of the four lines varies with  @xmath9 .",
    "thus differential isomorphism is too stringent a condition for equisingularity  there are too many equivalence classes.=-1    \\(d ) _ differential equisingularity _ of @xmath20 along @xmath11 at a smooth point  @xmath21 of  @xmath11 is associated with the whitney conditions @xmath22 holding at  @xmath21 .",
    "these conditions signify that if @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the singular locus of  @xmath1 ) approach  @xmath21 in such a way that the tangent space @xmath26 and the line joining @xmath27 to @xmath28 both have limiting positions , then the limit of the tangent spaces contains the limit of the lines .",
    "( the conditions can be described intrinsically , i.e. , as a condition on the prime ideal of  @xmath11 in the local ring @xmath29 , see proof of theorem  [ z is w ] below . )",
    "= 2.6 in    the conditions fail in example ( b ) above for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the limiting tangent space as @xmath32 being the plane while the limiting line is just @xmath8 .",
    "the conditions @xmath22 by themselves are not enough : in @xcite , zariski gives the example @xmath33 in which @xmath34 holds for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , but topological equisingularity does not hold at the origin along either of these components of the singular locus .",
    "one must require that a neighborhood of  @xmath21 in  @xmath11 be contained in a stratum of some whitney stratification ",
    "a stratification such that @xmath37 holds everywhere along  @xmath38 for any strata @xmath39 , @xmath38 with @xmath40 .",
    "in fact thom and mather showed that a whitney stratification of  @xmath1 is topologically equisingular in the following sense : for any point  @xmath21 of a stratum  @xmath41 , the germ @xmath42 together with its induced stratification is topologically the product of @xmath43 with a stratified germ @xmath44 in which @xmath21 is a stratum by itself ( see ( * ? ? ? * , ( 2.7 ) , and p.220 , corollary  ( 8.4 ) ) ) .",
    "the obvious formulation of a converse to the thom - mather theorem is false : in  @xcite , brianon and speder showed that the family of surface germs @xmath45 ( each member , for small  @xmath46 , having an isolated singularity at the origin ) is topologically equisingular , but not differentially so . on the other hand",
    ", there is a beautiful converse , due to l and teissier , equating topological and differential equisingularity of the totality of members of the family  @xmath47 as @xmath48 ranges over general linear spaces containing  @xmath11 ( see @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ,  4 ) ) .",
    "the approach to equisingularity via @xmath49 is the most extensively explored one .",
    "whitney stratifications are of basic importance in the classification theory of differentiable maps ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "( see also @xcite , for the existence of whitney stratifications in a general class of geometric categories . )",
    "hironaka proved that a whitney stratification is _ equimultiple : _ for any two strata @xmath39 , @xmath38 , the closure  @xmath50 has the same multiplicity ( possibly 0 ) at every point of  @xmath38 @xcite . more generally ,",
    "work of l and teissier in the early 1980 s , generalized in the 1990 s by gaffney and others , has led to characterizations of whitney equisingularity by the constancy of a finite sequence of  polar multiplicities . \" ( for this , and much else , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "35 of this paper are devoted to describing two plausible formulations of  analytic equisingularity \" and to trying to compare them with each other and with differential equisingularity .    in brief ,",
