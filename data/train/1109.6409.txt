    "due to the short range and high linear energy transfer in tissues , use of @xmath5-emitting radionuclides has appeared promising over the @xmath7-emitters in targeted therapy , where localization of dose becomes important .",
    "it is therefore necessary to find more potential radionuclides to make the targeted @xmath5-therapy a standard therapeutic modality .",
    "the rationale of selection of potential radionuclides depends on the nuclear property , methods of production and complexation behaviour with biological molecules . as a consequence ,",
    "nuclear science has become a major part in developing this particular field .",
    "so far , a few @xmath5-emitters were found to be suitable for the targeted therapy .",
    "due to short half - life and 3.97 mev @xmath5-particle , @xmath0 tb ( t@xmath8=4.118 h , decay mode : @xmath9 ( 83.3% ) and @xmath5 ( 16.7% ) ) is among the few promising @xmath5-emitting radionuclides , which are projected for human clinical use @xcite .",
    "this gives impetus to investigate nuclear reactions in detail to produce @xmath0 tb .",
    "production of proton rich @xmath0 tb is possible only in accelerators by + ( i ) light ion ( @xmath6 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath11he ) induced reactions on gd target + ( ii ) proton induced spallation reactions on high z material , ta or w , etc . , and + ( iii ) heavy ion induced reactions .",
    "+ however , hurdle lies in its production , particularly for applications , which demand significant quantity as well as purity of the radionuclide .",
    "only a few literatures are available that discussed on the production of @xmath0 tb @xcite .",
    "usually , light ion induced reactions are preferred to produce clinical radionuclides because of high yield . however , in case of @xmath0 tb , light ion induced productions suffer from a few shortcomings : ( i ) required projectile energy ( @xmath12 40 - 45 mev protons ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) and 100 mev @xmath5-particles ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) ) is not available in common accelerators , ( ii ) suitable enriched gd target may be required to maintain the purity of @xmath0 tb , ( iii ) purification of @xmath0 tb from the bulk target is not a easy task due to the similar chemical properties of lanthanides .",
    "a brief discussion on the light ion induced production of @xmath0 tb has been appended in sec .",
    "[ l3 ] .    due to",
    "the limited available facilities in the world , production of @xmath0 tb from 1 - 2 gev proton induced spallation reaction followed by online mass separation technique is also not feasible in practice . in this circumstance , it was assumed that heavy ion induced reactions may offer solution in producing @xmath0 tb radionuclides .",
    "several heavy ion reactions may lead to the production of @xmath0 tb either directly or as a decay product of @xmath0dy .",
    "alexander and simonoff @xcite measured excitation functions using @xmath5-spectrometry from twelve heavy ion reactions that produce @xmath0 tb from the deexcitation of the compound nucleus of tb .",
    "eight different heavy projectiles , @xmath13b , @xmath14b , @xmath4c , @xmath15n , @xmath16n , @xmath17o , @xmath18o and @xmath19f , were used in combination with a variety of target isotopes from ba to nd , among which @xmath20pr is the only naturally abundant mononuclidic target .",
    "it was found that the peak cross section measured in all target - projectile combinations is maximum 7% of the theoretical estimation .",
    "this led to the conclusion that the compound nuclei having angular momentum less than 7.5@xmath211.5@xmath22 contributing to these reactions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that all the production routes offer comparable peak cross sections of @xmath0 tb without any added advantage of using enriched targets .",

    "the cross section data presented for @xmath0 tb from @xmath20pr(@xmath4c,4n)@xmath0 tb reaction were two orders of magnitude more with respect to @xcite and were likely for the high - spin isomeric state , @xmath0tb@xmath27 ( t@xmath8=4.16 min ) . among the various target - projectile combination studied in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath20pr(@xmath4c,4n)@xmath0 tb is the only common reaction found for the comparative study .",
    "no other experiment has been reported till now towards the production of @xmath0 tb from this particular target - projectile combination to justify the reported results of @xcite and the ambiguity , if any , lies between them . however , we reported recently the yield of @xmath0 tb and @xmath0gd under particular experimental condition and suggested the required chemistry for mutual separation of @xmath0 tb and @xmath0gd from praseodymium target @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 tb has dominating electron capture ( 83.3% ) decay mode and relatively long half - life compared to its high spin ( @xmath28 ) isomeric state @xmath0tb@xmath27 , which directly decays to @xmath0gd ( t@xmath8=9.28 d ) via electron capture ( 99.98% ) .",
    "this situation favours off - line @xmath3-spectrometric investigation of the production of @xmath0 tb along with other residues .",
    "we therefore made an attempt to study the excitation functions from the @xmath4c - induced reactions on natural @xmath20pr target in the 79 - 44 mev incident energy range by off - line @xmath3-spectrometry .",

    "the experiment was carried out at the barc - tifr pelletron accelerator facility , mumbai , india .",
    "the integrated charge was recorded in each irradiation by an electron suppressed faraday cup stationed at the back of the target assembly .",
    "projectile energy at a target is the average of the incident and outgoing beam energies .",
    "beam energy degradation in the target and the catcher foils have been calculated using the stopping and range of ions in matter ( srim ) @xcite .    at the end of bombardment ( eob ) ,",
    "off - line @xmath3-spectrometric study was carried out in each foil in a regular time interval up to seven days using an hpge detector having resolution 2.13 kev at 1332 kev coupled with a pc based mca .",
    "the background subtracted peak area count corresponding to a particular @xmath3-ray energy is the measure of yield of an evaporation residue .",

    "uncertainty in incident beam energy may occur at the successive targets due to energy degradation in the aluminum catchers .",
    "however , according to ref @xcite , the energy straggling is expected to be small even in case of lowest incident energy and hence was neglected in this work . in addition , error may occur in the measurement from the counting statistics .",

    "it has also been observed that pace4 expects peak of the gaussian at 72 mev incident energy with @xmath12 600 mb cross section for @xmath0 tb while the measured excitation function peaks around 62 mev incident energy with a cross section @xmath375% of the theoretical expectation .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath20pr(@xmath4c,4n ) reaction channel measured by kossakowski et al . by online @xmath3-spectrometry are comparatively very high , 408 mb at 77.4 mev incident energy , and do commensurate neither with our measurement nor with the measurement of alexander and simonoff @xcite .",
    "the high values were possibly the production cross sections of @xmath0tb@xmath27 , the high spin ( @xmath28 ) isomer of @xmath0 tb .",
    "this observation indicates that the interaction of @xmath4c - projectile with @xmath20pr target forms mostly excited compound nucleus @xmath38 tb in the high spin state which preferentially decays to the short - lived high spin state @xmath0tb@xmath27 ( 4.16 min , @xmath28 ) .",

    "the @xmath0 tb ( @xmath40 ) is produced only from the low spin compound nuclei of @xmath38 tb and this gives low cross section values for @xmath0 tb .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthy to mention that two independent measurements of excitation function of @xmath0 tb using @xmath5- and @xmath3-spectrometry complement each other with a confirmation of low cross section of @xmath0 tb .",

    "pace4 estimates production cross section of maximum 120 mb at 75 mev incident energy for @xmath0gd in direct reaction .",

    "measured 63@xmath2112 and 28@xmath214 mb cross section at 77.4 and 85.5 mev respectively in @xmath20pr(@xmath4c , p3n)@xmath0gd reaction .",
    "though only two experimental cross section values are available for @xmath0gd , they are either comparable or lower than the theoretical expectation .",
    "the cumulative cross sections of @xmath0gd more or less follow the theoretical excitation function of @xmath20pr(@xmath4c,4n)@xmath0 tb with a little shift in peak energy to 75 mev .",

    "therefore , it may be concluded that the high cross section of @xmath0gd is due to the huge production of @xmath0tb@xmath27 , which essentially decays to @xmath0gd .",
    "the cross section values reported by kossakowski et al . for @xmath20pr(@xmath4c,4n)@xmath0 tb reaction nicely corroborate with the cumulative cross sections of @xmath0gd at the higher incident energies with an overlap of energy at 77.4 mev . at this particular energy ,",
    "the cumulative cross section of @xmath0gd ( 489@xmath2124 mb ) is nearly the sum of cross sections of @xmath0gd ( 63@xmath2112 mb ) and @xmath0 tb ( 408@xmath2176 mb ) reported by kossakowski et al .",
    "@xcite , whereas only 3.7@xmath210.4 mb cross secton has been measured for low spin @xmath0 tb .",

    "production of @xmath0tb@xmath27 dominates over the incident energy range , though the production of @xmath0 tb is relatively higher below 65 mev incident energy .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows comparison of measured cross sections of @xmath1 tb and @xmath2 tb with those calculated from pace4 .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath1 tb are found to be maximum 14% of the theoretical estimation .",
    "the measured excitation function peaks at 54 mev with an average 53.9@xmath217.5 mb cross section for @xmath1 tb .",
    "kossakowski et al . measured 36@xmath2113 mb cross section of @xmath1 tb at 77.4 mev by online @xmath3-spectrometry",
    "however , we have observed no production of @xmath1 tb in off - line @xmath3-spectrometry above 72 mev .",
    "like @xmath0 tb , low cross section of @xmath1 tb may be due to the fact that the excited compound nucleus formed in high spin state prefers to produce high spin isomeric state @xmath1tb@xmath27 ( 5.8 min , 9@xmath41 ) , which decays to long - lived @xmath5-emitter @xmath1gd ( 1.8 my ) .",
    "the compound nuclei formed in the low spin state are only responsible in producing @xmath1 tb ( 2@xmath42 ) . measured cross sections of @xmath2 tb",
    "were found comparable but absolute values are higher than that calculated from pace4 . in case of ( @xmath4c,2n ) channel ,",
    "the similar explanation is applicable towards production of @xmath2tb@xmath27(25 s , @xmath28 ) , but 93.4% @xmath2tb@xmath27 decays to @xmath2 tb via internal conversion .",

    "the reaction model code alice @xcite is well established to investigate light ion induced reactions at low incident energies . however ,",
    "alice does not consider direct reaction processes , which are prevalent in case of high energy @xmath6 or @xmath5 projectiles .",
    "therefore , we have estimated excitation functions of @xmath6 and @xmath5-particle induced reactions on @xmath25gd and @xmath26gd targets , which are contributing to the production of @xmath0 tb , using the nuclear reaction model code talys @xcite .",

    "is expected for @xmath0 tb at 40 mev incident energy , whereas only 200 mb cross section is obtained at 65 mev from @xmath6+@xmath26gd reaction . in view of the production of @xmath0 tb ,",
    "40 - 45 mev proton induced reaction on enriched @xmath25gd target is preferred .",

    "about 250 mb cross section of @xmath0 tb has been estimated in @xmath25gd(@xmath5 , p6n)@xmath0 tb reaction .",
    "decay of @xmath0dy produced via @xmath25gd(@xmath5 , 7n ) reaction is extected to enhance the production of @xmath0 tb .",
    "however , comparable production of impurity ( @xmath1 tb , @xmath2 tb , @xmath0gd ) is also expected with @xmath0 tb .",
    "it is not also reasonable to use @xmath26gd as production cross section of @xmath0 tb is quite low ( 100 mb ) and needs high energy @xmath5-paricles ( 120 mev ) .",
    "therefore , production of pure @xmath0 tb , located far away from the stability zone , is limited by the practical constraints even in light ion reactions .",
