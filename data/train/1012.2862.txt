    "before the launch of the _ fermi _  gamma - ray space telescope , the only pulsars with definitive detections in @xmath0-rays  ( using egret on _ cgro _ ) were young and very energetic ( @xmath5ergs@xmath4 ) or nearby older systems ( @xmath6ergs@xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "a possible detection of pulsed @xmath0-rays  from the energetic msp j0218@xmath74232 @xcite , sparked interest in modeling msp @xmath0-ray  emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the launch of _ fermi _  and the extraordinary sensitivity of the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , confirmed those predictions of @xmath0-ray - bright msps with detections of eight relatively normal radio msps using only the first few months of _ fermi _  events @xcite .",
    "those msps were detected via the folding of @xmath0-rays  modulo the known spin and orbital ephemerides from radio timing campaigns @xcite .    in order to best utilize radio telescope time to search either for radio counterparts to new @xmath0-ray - selected pulsars or to search blindly for radio pulsations from @xmath0-ray  sources that might contain pulsars , we formed the pulsar search consortium ( psc ) , a group of approximately 20 lat - team members and/or pulsar experts associated with large radio telescopes around the world .",
    "this paper describes one of the psc s first programs , which used the green bank telescope ( gbt ) to search 25 unassociated sources from the _ fermi _  lat bright source list @xcite .",

    "the 820mhz center frequency was chosen as a compromise between the competing effects of sky temperature ( from the galactic synchrotron background ) and beamsize , as well as steep pulsar spectra and the effects of interstellar dispersion and scattering .    for a pulsar with a pulse width of @xmath210% of the period ,",

    "we generated spectra of this source by extracting events from around the pulsar in 35^@xmath36  regions for the mos images and a 25^@xmath36  region ( due to a chip gap ) for the pn image .",
    "this yielded spectra consisting of 853 , 812 , and 2164 events from the mos1 , mos2 , and pn cameras , respectively .",
    "we group the counts with at least 30 events per spectral bin for the mos spectra and 45 events per bin for the pn spectra using the ftool grppha .",

    "* ) with the neutron star mass and radius held fixed at 1.4m_@xmath24  and 10 km , and the source distance fixed at the dispersion measure value of 0.4kpc , yields a reduced @xmath37=1.41 ( 61 dof ) . in this model",
    "there are significant residuals above 1.5kev so we add a power - law component with photon index fixed at 1.8 and obtain an improved fit with @xmath37=1.09 ( 60 dof ) .",
    "this latter fit yields an atmospheric temperature ( seen at infinity ) @xmath41ev ( 90% confidence ) , a best fit @xmath42 consistent with zero and a 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath43@xmath35 , and flux in the 0.5@xmath93kev energy band @xmath44ergs@xmath35s@xmath4 . in this model",
    "the power - law spectral component accounts for roughly 25% of the total flux in the 0.5@xmath93kev energy band .",
    "we have identified three new nearby radio msps as the counterparts of bright and previously unassociated _ fermi _ lat sources at high galactic latitude .",
    "our non - detection of young pulsars or msps in the more numerous sources searched at low galactic latitude is likely due to our only moderate sensitivity improvements ( typically 2@xmath93@xmath21 ) over the best surveys of those regions to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to higher sky temperatures resulting from our lower observing frequency .",
    "additionally , the complicated and confused nature of the galactic plane in @xmath0-rays  makes the positive identification of point sources difficult .",
    "several of the bright sources may be blends of other sources or the result of insufficient modelling of the galactic background .",
    "nonetheless , deeper surveys at frequencies of 1.5@xmath92ghz of these sources may prove more fruitful in the future .",
    "the new pulsars are very typical radio msps in terms of spin period , binary parameters , magnetic field strength , spin - down luminosity , and characteristic age , and their unusual brightness in @xmath0-rays  is likely due more to their proximity than to especially energetic emission processes in their magnetospheres .",
    "the very high implied @xmath0-rayefficiency for psr j0614@xmath93329  suggests it is likely closer , by up to a factor of 2 or more , than predicted by the ne2001 model @xcite .",
    "the line - of - sight to psr j0614@xmath93329  is nearly tangent to the gum nebula where ne2001 shows an exceptionally steep dm gradient .",
    "additionally , the pulsar s @xmath0-ray  emission is likely not isotropic , but only covers tens of percent of the sky . these large efficiencies in general ,",
    "though , are consistent with the tens of percent values found by @xcite for radio msps detected in @xmath0-rays  and imply that msps are very efficient producers of @xmath0-rays .",
    "we do not have proper motion measurements for pulsars j0614@xmath93329  or j1231@xmath91411and so their measured spin - down rates are contaminated at some level ( likely @xmath4510% ) by the shklovskii effect @xcite .",
    "there is a statistically significant proper motion measurement of @xmath2100masyr@xmath4 for j1231@xmath91411 , though , which implies a shklovskii effect at 400pc larger than the measured spin - down rate for the pulsar .",
    "if the proper motion is confirmed at this level , the requirement to have the pulsar intrinsically spinning down gives an upper limit for the pulsar s distance of @xmath2240pc .",
    "timing observations over the next several years will determine the proper motions and possibly the timing parallaxes for each of the pulsars .",
    "in all three cases we identified x - ray counterparts to the pulsars which substantially aided in the rapid establishment of timing solutions .",
    "the three msps appear to have fairly typical x - ray properties for radio msps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with primarily soft thermal - like spectra and x - ray luminosities in the 10@xmath3ergs@xmath4 range , approximately 10@xmath46 to 10@xmath47 of their @xmath0-ray  luminosities .",
    "the radio flux densities of @xmath21mjy near 1ghz are large enough to make the msps potentially useful for a wide variety of timing projects , such as the detection of gravitational waves via long - term pulsar timing ( e.g. nanograv ) , yet they are small enough to explain why earlier large - area surveys for pulsars missed them ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the fact that many of the nearby radio msps are being detected in @xmath0-raysand vice - versa argues that the sizes of the radio and @xmath0-ray  beams are comparable for msps ( likely within a factor of @xmath22 ) , and that deep radio and @xmath0-ray  surveys may allow us to eventually detect a large percentage of the local population of these sources . in the short - term , the fact that _ fermi _ can point us to nearby radio msps is already causing a large increase in the number of known systems , with much less effort than is required by sensitive large - area radio surveys .",
    "if most radio msps produce @xmath0-rays  as these early results seem to indicate , msps may contribute to the diffuse isotropic @xmath0-ray  background @xcite .",
