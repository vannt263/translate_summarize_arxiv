    "a significant feature in the mott transition is the emergence of states in the mott gap in the single - particle spectrum due to the doping of a mott insulator .",
    "@xcite since such a feature does not appear when a noninteracting band insulator is doped , this phenomenon must be related to strong electronic correlations intrinsic in the mott transition . however , although these states , which are called doping - induced states or in - gap states , have been observed in materials such as cuprate high - temperature ( high-@xmath2 ) superconductors and in various theoretical calculations , @xcite their interpretations are controversial .    in particular , the question of whether the doping - induced states in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models in the parameter regime relevant to high-@xmath2 cuprates near the mott transition are essentially disconnected from the low - energy states by an energy gap or not has attracted considerable interest .",
    "this is because this issue is related not only to the nature of the mott transition but also to the fermi surface near the mott transition ( hole pockets or a free - electron - like fermi surface ) @xcite and the anomalous features observed in high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "@xcite the presence of the energy gap has been suggested by numerical calculations @xcite and interpreted in terms of various concepts , such as the binding between double occupancy and vacancy , @xcite the effect of a charge 2@xmath3 boson , @xcite hybridization between the quasiparticle and cofermion , @xcite and a spin - polaron shakeoff .",
    "@xcite the absence of the energy gap has also been suggested by numerical calculations , @xcite where the doping - induced states have been interpreted as a quasiparticle coupled with antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite and as essentially the magnetic excitation of the mott insulator which emerges in the single - particle spectrum because charge character is added by doping .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we address this issue from a general perspective , by investigating how the dispersion relation of the doping - induced states should generally behave in the small - doping limit of a continuous mott transition , based on an analysis of the quantum numbers and the overlaps of relevant states .",
    "the validity of the argument is demonstrated using the two - leg ladder and bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models .",
    "an intuitive real - space picture of the doping - induced states is also presented .",
    "we consider zero - temperature properties of repulsively interacting systems where the ground states are mott insulators at half - filling and metals in the small - doping limit .",
    "the numbers of sites , unit cells , electrons , and doped holes are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the doping concentration is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "we study the single - particle spectral function defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the ground state at @xmath12 and the excitation energy of the eigenstate @xmath13 from @xmath10 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath14 denotes the creation operator of an electron with momentum @xmath15 and magnetization @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath10 has spin @xmath17 , magnetization @xmath18 , and momentum @xmath19 , @xmath20 can be nonzero only for @xmath13 with @xmath21 holes , spin @xmath22 , magnetization @xmath23 , and momentum @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite in addition , if the ground - state energy ( including the chemical - potential term ) at @xmath12 is lower than that of @xmath25 by @xmath26 , @xmath6-conserving excited states with excitation energy @xmath27 from @xmath28 can contribute to @xmath29 at @xmath12 , where @xmath30 for @xmath31 in a metallic phase ( including @xmath32 ) . in interacting systems , it is generally expected that low - energy eigenstates ( particularly those of dominant excitations ) having the same quantum numbers as those of components of @xmath33 have nonzero overlap with @xmath33 for @xmath15 where the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) is not completely filled .",
    "thus , if @xmath34 has spin 1/2 and momentum @xmath19 , @xmath35 with spin 0 and momentum @xmath36 should contribute to @xmath29 at @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the top of the hole - like band [ lhb at half - filling ( @xmath39 ) ] in the small - doping limit , which causes hole - pocket - like behavior as in a doped band insulator .",
    "@xcite in addition , the magnetically excited states with spin 1 at half - filling @xcite having the dispersion relation @xmath40 should emerge following doping along @xmath41 in @xmath29 for @xmath15 where the lhb is not completely filled .    according to this argument ,",
    "if the magnetic excitation of the mott insulator is gapless at momenta @xmath36 and @xmath42 , the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit should also be gapless at @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 if @xmath46 ) and exhibit the momentum - shifted magnetic dispersion relation in the momentum region where the lhb is not completely filled ( primarily outside the fermi surface ) .",
    "this behavior essentially agrees with the results for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) and 2d hubbard models in refs . and those for the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model in ref . and suggests the coexistence of hole - like behavior and electron - like behavior for @xmath47 .",
    "although it has been pointed out that the spin-0 and spin-1 states at half - filling can appear in the electron - addition spectrum at @xmath48 , the relationship of the momenta ( dispersion relations ) has not been recognized in ref . ;",
    "the doping - induced states in the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models have been considered to be disconnected by an energy gap from the low - energy states relevant to hole - like fermi surfaces and have been interpreted as spin - polaron shakeoff bands in refs . .",
    "however , according to the above argument , it is natural to interpret the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit as essentially the states of the spin - wave mode of the mott insulator and to consider that they exhibit the gapless spin - wave dispersion relation @xcite shifted by @xmath19 in the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models .",
    "to strengthen the above argument , we consider the @xmath0-@xmath1 model defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the annihilation operator @xmath52 and number operator @xmath53 of an electron with magnetization @xmath16 at site @xmath54 . here , @xmath55 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath54 . at each site , a vacant state @xmath56 or a singly - occupied magnetization-@xmath16 state @xmath57 is allowed , but double occupancy is forbidden . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath35 has spin 0 and momentum @xmath36 and that @xmath34 has spin 1/2 , magnetization @xmath58 , and momentum @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , @xmath35 on a bipartite lattice with the same number of sites in the two sublattices has spin 0 in a finite - size system with @xmath59 for neighboring sites between the two sublattices and @xmath60 otherwise .",
    "@xcite    because @xmath61 can be expressed as @xmath62 and @xmath63 using @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the state at site @xmath54 ( @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and 0 otherwise ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 using the site @xmath70 coordinate @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) means that the overlaps between the electron - addition states at @xmath48 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) and the single - spin excited states at half - filling ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) are related to the overlap between the electron - removal state for the momentum at the top of the lhb at half - filling ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath34 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap0 ] ) , if @xmath77 is @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are expected to be @xmath81 at @xmath82 @xmath15-points . then",
    ", for these @xmath15-points , the normalized electron - addition states should normally have @xmath78 overlap with the normalized single - spin excited states because @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "@xcite    in addition , because all sites are singly occupied at half - filling , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "hence , @xmath87 thus , the overlap can be roughly estimated in a decoupling approximation as @xmath88 where @xmath89 . at @xmath37 , @xmath90 because @xmath35 is assumed to be a spin-0 state .",
    "the above results imply that the single - spin excited states of the mott insulator contribute significantly to the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit for @xmath15 where the lhb is not completely filled ( @xmath91 ) and for @xmath92 if @xmath77 is @xmath78 . in 1d systems , even if @xmath93 for @xmath94 , @xcite exact - solution analyses and numerical calculations strongly suggest that the mode of the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit primarily reflects the dominant part of the magnetic excitation .",
    "to demonstrate the validity of this argument , we consider the two - leg ladder and square - lattice bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is not too small for the ground state to have spin 0 or 1/2 [ ] )",
    ". here , @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote @xmath102 and @xmath103 for neighboring sites between chains ( planes ) , respectively , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 denote @xmath102 and @xmath103 for neighboring sites in chains ( planes ) , respectively , in the ladder ( bilayer ) model .",
    "the other @xmath106 and @xmath107 are set to zero .",
    "although some aspects of the doping - induced states in similar models have been discussed , @xcite this paper clarifies the nature of the doping - induced states through explicit calculations of the spectral weights , dispersion relation , and overlaps with magnetically excited states , using the effective eigenstates up to @xmath108 and @xmath109 .      the ground state at half - filling ( spin 0 and momentum @xmath36 ) , the low - energy spin-1 eigenstate at half - filling , and the low - energy eigenstate at @xmath48 are expressed , respectively , as @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 represent the two - electron spin-0 state , spin-1 state , and one - electron bonding state , respectively , at the @xmath70-th two - site unit cell with coordinate @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "here , @xmath18 and @xmath116 denote the magnetization and inter - unit - cell momentum , respectively .",
    "the magnetic dispersion relation at half - filling is obtained by calculating the excitation energy of @xmath117 from @xmath35 : @xmath118 the ground state at @xmath48 with magnetization @xmath58 ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath119 if @xmath116 can be set to @xmath120 , where @xmath120 indicates @xmath121 and @xmath122 for 1d and 2d systems , respectively . for the small - doping limit , the value of @xmath123 is set such that @xmath124 with @xmath30 .",

    "thus , there are spectral weights at @xmath133 and @xmath38 in @xmath134 [ @xmath135 and essentially along the dispersion relation of the magnetic excitation shifted by @xmath136 , @xmath137 , in @xmath138 [ @xmath139 , where @xmath134 and @xmath138 denote the spectral functions for @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "the shift of @xmath120 is due to the momentum difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the spectral weight for @xmath142 averaged over the momentum is @xmath143 , which is consistent with the spectral - weight sum rule .",
    "@xcite one quarter of this spectral weight ( @xmath144 ) is from the ground state at half - filling , which contributes to the mode causing hole - pocket - like behavior , whereas three quarters ( @xmath145 ) is from the magnetically excited states ( @xmath117 ) , which spread over the entire @xmath116 region for @xmath146 and can be identified as the doping - induced states .",
    "in addition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap0 ] ) and the validity of the decoupling approximation [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap2 ] ) ] can be confirmed using @xmath147      a similar analysis is applicable to multi - hole - doped cases in the small - doping regime .",
    "the ground state at @xmath12 is effectively expressed as a linear combination of direct products of @xmath148 @xmath149 and @xmath150 @xmath151 states . because the doping - induced states are obtained by replacing one of the @xmath148 @xmath149 states with @xmath152 , the spectral weights increase as @xmath153 increases .",
    "in addition , because a magnetic - excitation mode similar to that of the mott insulator remains for @xmath154 and because the fermi momenta remain near @xmath155 , significant spectral weights should continue to be located almost along the momentum - shifted magnetic dispersion relation of the mott insulator in @xmath138 .",
    "the states obtained by replacing one of the @xmath148 @xmath149 states with @xmath151 form a mode as in a doped band insulator ( @xmath156 the upper edge of the lhb at half - filling ) in @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite        more simply and generally , the behavior of the spectral function at finite @xmath157 can be understood as being deformed continuously from that of the small - doping limit if phase transition does not occur for @xmath158 .",
    "this change should be small in the small - doping regime .",

    "the mode for @xmath164 in @xmath162 at @xmath165 corresponds to the doping - induced states and exhibits almost the same dispersion relation as that of the magnetic excitation at @xmath39 , but shifted by approximately @xmath121 in @xmath166 [ figs .",

    "[ fig : akw ] are consistent with the above analysis .",
    "the results shown in this section ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2siteclusters ] ) demonstrate that the magnetically excited states of the mott insulator emerge as the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit in 1d and 2d systems and that the dispersion relation of the doping - induced states is essentially the same as that of the magnetic excitation , but shifted by the fermi momentum . in the above ladder and bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models , the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit are disconnected from the low - energy states because the magnetic excitation at half - filling has an energy gap ; in models having a gapless magnetic excitation at half - filling , the doping - induced states should exhibit a gapless dispersion relation in the small - doping limit .",
    "the difference in the electron - addition spectra between a mott insulator and the small - doping limit is explained as follows . in a mott insulator , @xmath169 yields no spectral weights in the mott gap because there are no eigenstates with @xmath170 in this energy regime . in the small - doping limit , in contrast",
    ", @xmath171 can yield spectral weights in the mott gap because low - energy eigenstates for the magnetic excitation of the mott insulator exist .",
    "@xcite    the emergence of the electron - addition states in the mott gap reflects the spin - charge separation of the mott insulator .",
    "@xcite the spin - charge separation means that the low - energy properties are described in terms of independent spin and/or charge degrees of freedom rather than in terms of an electron - like quasiparticle . in 1d interacting electron systems ,",
    "the spin - charge separation occurs even in a metallic phase in the low - energy limit .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in a mott insulator , the spin - charge separation occurs @xcite in any dimension : the low - energy properties are described in terms of the spin excitation which is gapless or has an energy gap of the order of the ( effective ) spin - spin interaction , whereas the charge excitation has an energy gap of the order of the coulomb interaction . because of this spin - charge separation , although there are low - energy magnetically excited states , the electron - addition excitation does not have spectral weights in the mott gap in a mott insulator ; the charge quantum number of the magnetically excited states ( @xmath172 ) differs from that of @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "however , the magnetically excited states can emerge in the electron - addition spectrum with the dispersion relation shifted by the fermi momentum following the doping of the mott insulator as discussed above .",
    "@xcite this is in contrast with the noninteracting band insulator case , where the lowest spin excitation energy is the same as the band gap .    in the ladder and bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models considered above ,",
    "although the ground - state behavior is similar to that of a ( doped ) band insulator , the characteristic of the mott transition ( the emergence of the states ) occurs for @xmath142 , reflecting the spin - charge separation of the mott insulator ( the presence of the low - energy spin excitation and the absence of the low - energy charge excitation ) .",
    "the situation in the small - doping regime can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "the added electron , which is located at the position of a vacancy at low energies , has almost no chance to hop to another vacant site if vacancies are distributed homogeneously .",
    "however , the added electron can hop with a small energy to a neighboring site occupied by an electron having the opposite magnetization , at the same time as that electron hops to the site that was occupied by the added electron .",
    "this is nothing but the spin exchange process .",
    "thus , in general , the electron - addition excitation in the small - doping regime exhibits a dispersion relation similar to that of the magnetic excitation of the mott insulator , but shifted by the fermi momentum .",
    "this shift is due to the momentum difference between the ground states before and after the electron addition .",
    "the spectral weight in the large - repulsion regime should be @xmath173 because the probability that the added electron occupies a vacant site is essentially @xmath174 in the small - doping regime .",
    "even if the ground state at half - filling has an antiferromagnetic long - range order , @xmath171 should have nonzero overlap with the spin - wave mode at half - filling because both involve spin-1 components if @xmath35 and @xmath34 have spin-0 and spin-1/2 components , respectively .",
    "thus , the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit are expected to exhibit essentially the same dispersion relation as that of the spin - wave mode , but shifted by the fermi momentum , in the momentum region where the lhb is not completely filled ( primarily outside the fermi surface ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with the results for the 2d hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models in refs . .",
    "the continuous transformation of the single - particle dispersion relation for @xmath142 into the momentum - shifted magnetic dispersion relation of the mott insulator does not necessarily mean that the magnetic excitation of the mott insulator is interpreted in terms of spinons ( spin-1/2 and charge-0 quasiparticles ) , because this characteristic is independent of quasiparticle pictures .",
    "the momentum shift is simply due to the momentum difference between the ground states before and after the electron addition . in the above ladder and bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models",
    ", the magnetic excitation is typically interpreted in terms of a triplon ( spin-1 and charge-0 quasiparticle ) .",
    "the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit can involve not only the magnetically excited states but also other low - energy excited states ( spin-0 excited states ) at half - filling if @xmath171 contains components with these quantum numbers .",
    "nevertheless , the doping - induced states are expected to be primarily due to the magnetic excitation because this is generally the most dominant low - energy excitation in a mott insulator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : akw ] ) .",
    "@xcite    in a first - order mott transition where phase separation occurs for @xmath175 , the states obtained by adding an electron in the @xmath176 limit are mixtures of the electron - addition states from the ground state at @xmath177 and those at @xmath178 , which are not exactly the magnetically excited states at half - filling .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersing mode for @xmath142 in the lhb before the mott transition in the large - repulsion regime should more or less reflect the magnetic excitation from a mott insulating state ( an eigenstate at half - filling ) similar to the ground state at @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the indications that a spin - charge - separated mott insulator is being approached , such as a reduction in spectral weight from the dispersing mode , @xcite are expected to generally appear near the mott transition in the large - repulsion regime , provided the value of @xmath179 is relatively small .",
    "we consider the issue of the doping - induced states in the 2d hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . because the low - energy magnetic excitation at half - filling is well described in terms of the gapless spin - wave mode , @xcite according to the present results , a mode exhibiting the spin - wave dispersion relation shifted by the fermi momenta should emerge in the electron - addition spectrum in the small - doping limit",
    "; the mode should be gapless at the fermi momenta because the spin - wave mode is gapless .",
    "if the lhb around @xmath180 is essentially completely filled , the mode appears primarily outside this momentum region .",

    "the general and direct relationships of the doping - induced states with the magnetically excited states of the mott insulator were clarified based on an analysis of the quantum numbers and the overlaps , as well as through a demonstration using the ladder and bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models .",
    "the results imply that the doping - induced states in the small - doping limit exhibit essentially the same dispersion relation as that of the magnetic excitation of the mott insulator , but shifted by the fermi momentum , in the momentum region where the lhb is not completely filled in a continuous mott transition .",
    "this characteristic should be general and independent of the dimensionality and quasiparticle pictures .    with the reverse use of this characteristic , the magnetic dispersion relation of the mott insulator",
    "can be inferred from the dispersion relation of the electron - addition excitation in the small - doping limit by shifting this dispersion relation by the fermi momentum . in particular ,",

    "<S> in strongly correlated electron systems , the emergence of states in the mott gap in the single - particle spectrum following the doping of the mott insulator is a remarkable feature that can not be explained in a conventional rigid - band picture . here , </S>",
    "<S> based on an analysis of the quantum numbers and the overlaps of relevant states , as well as through a demonstration using the ladder and bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1 models , it is shown that in a continuous mott transition due to hole doping , the magnetically excited states of the mott insulator generally emerge in the electron - addition spectrum with the dispersion relation shifted by the fermi momentum in the momentum region where the lower hubbard band is not completely filled . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the dispersion relation of a free - electron - like mode in the electron - addition spectrum eventually transforms into essentially the momentum - shifted magnetic dispersion relation of the mott insulator , while its spectral weight gradually disappears toward the mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> this feature reflects the spin - charge separation of the mott insulator . </S>"
