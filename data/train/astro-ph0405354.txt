    "a majority ( @xmath460% ) of seyfert 1 galaxies show outflow of ionized gas from their nuclei , as revealed by intrinsic ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray absorption lines that are blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocities of the galaxies .",
    "the significance of the outflows is illustrated by the fact that the inferred mass - loss rates are comparable to the mass - accretion rates ( crenshaw , kraemer , & george 2003a ) .",
    "dynamical models of the outflowing absorbers make use of thermal winds , radiation pressure , and/or hydromagnetic flows from the central accretion disk , presumably responsible for most of the continuum radiation , or from the nearby broad - line region or torus .",
    "to constrain the dynamical models , and in particular to test the hypothesis that radiation pressure is the driving force , it is important to determine their rate of occurrence and variation in properties as functions of the luminosity of the central continuum source .    at luminosities higher than those of seyferts , a significant fraction of quasars ( 25% to 55% )",

    ", ngc  4395 provides the best case for a low - luminosity agn with intrinsic absorption that could possibly be attributed to the nucleus .",

    ", we have obtained new observations with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst_. we were also motivated by our previous study of the emission - line regions in ngc 4395 ( kraemer et al .",
    "1999 ) , which revealed that both the broad - line region ( blr ) and narrow - line region ( nlr ) should have large ( @xmath1650% ) covering factors of the central source , and thus might be detectable in absorption .",
    "we observed the nucleus of ngc 4395 contemporaneously with _ fuse _ and stis at high spectral resolutions , to identify possible absorption systems in the uv .",
    "we obtained the _ fuse _ observations on 2003 february 25 ut with a total exposure time of 36,000 s. we used the standard 30@xmath17 @xmath18 30@xmath17 low - resolution aperture ( lwrs ) , which samples a much larger circumnuclear region than our stis observation ( see below ) .",

    "given the lack of obvious variability on 90-minute time scales , we averaged the e140 m spectra together to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "comparison of the stis and _ fuse _ spectra in the region of overlap ( 1150  1180",
    " ) reveals that the _ fuse _ continuum flux is 3.0 times higher than that from stis .",
    "although we can not rule out variability in the uv continuum flux over the 12-day interval between the observations , we demonstrate that the principal source of the flux discrepancy is the presence of hot stars in the large _ fuse _ aperture .",
    "this is not surprising , since there is intense star formation occurring throughout ngc 4395 ( cedrs & cepa 2002 ) .",
    "given that there are no available far - uv images of ngc 4395 ( which will change with the release of the galex all - sky survey ) , we test the hot - star hypothesis in three ways : with a near - uv image , with the h@xmath23 images of cedrs & cepa ( 2002 ) , and by comparing the fuse spectrum with starburst models from leitherer et al .",

    ", we get that @xmath24(h@xmath23 ) @xmath25 4.45 @xmath18 10@xmath26 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath22 for the other two sources . based on this value , we calculate from equation ( 2 ) in kennicutt ( 1998 ) that this corresponds to a star formation rate of 8.4 @xmath18 10@xmath27  m@xmath9  yr@xmath0 .",
    "this star formation rate corresponds to a far - ultraviolet flux of @xmath24@xmath28(1150  ) @xmath25 5.7 @xmath18 10@xmath21 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath22 @xmath0 using equation ( 1 ) in kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "these calculations are based on a continuous star formation rate over a period of @xmath4100  myr , which can give different results from the ones obtained using an instantaneous burst . according to cedrs & cepa ( 2002 ) , the equivalent widths of h@xmath23 emission are log ( ew /  ) @xmath25 2.46 and 2.61 for regions 97 and 98 , respectively . using the starburst99 models for an instantaneous burst with metallicity 0.4 solar and salpeter imf ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , we find that these equivalent widths correspond to bursts with ages of @xmath45  myr .",
    "scaling the 5  myr model to match the observed h@xmath23 flux , we get a continuum flux of @xmath24@xmath28(1150  ) @xmath25 8.5 @xmath18 10@xmath21 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath22 @xmath0 .",
    "both of these estimates are close to the excess far - uv flux in the _ fuse _ aperture of f@xmath28(1150   ) @xmath25 5.9 ( @xmath201.1 ) @xmath18 10@xmath21 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath22 @xmath0 .",
    "the third test for the hot stars hypothesis was done by comparing the _ fuse _ spectrum with starburst models created using starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",

    "the models assume an instantaneous burst with a salpeter imf , upper and lower mass limits of 100  m@xmath9 and 1  m@xmath9 , respectively , and a metallicity of 0.4z@xmath9 , which is consistent with the values measured by cedrs & cepa ( 2002 ) .",
    "we restrict our comparison of the fuse spectrum to models with ages between 3  myr and 7  myr , which is consistent with the age obtained for regions 97 and 98 based on the equivalent widths of h@xmath23 . in order to compare the fuse spectrum with the starburst models",
    ", we first corrected the spectrum of ngc 4395 for galactic reddening , using the value e(b - v ) @xmath25 0.074 from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "internal reddening is not a problem in the nucleus of this galaxy ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "we then corrected the spectrum for redshift , and resampled it to 0.13   in wavelength , which is the spectral resolution of the models .",
    "the resulting spectrum is presented as a thin line in figure 1 . since approximately one third of the flux observed by fuse at 1150 originates at the nucleus",
    ", we used the @xmath29 spectrum to determine the slope of the agn continuum and extrapolate it to lower wavelengths .",
    "we did this by fitting a power law ( f@xmath30 ) to the continuum regions in the wavelength range 1268  1730   ( thereby avoiding possible contamination from stars at longer wavelengths ) .",
    "we found that the agn continuum can be represented by a power law with slope @xmath31 .",
    "the extrapolation of this power law to shorter wavelengths is shown as a thick dotted line in figure 1 .",
    "we also show a spectrum from a 5  myr starburst model ( thick solid line ) , scaled so that when added to the power law , its flux is the same as the one observed in ngc 4395 over the wavelength range 1102 - 1107 .",
    "due to the low s / n ratio of the _ fuse _ spectrum of ngc4395 , we did not attempt a detailed modeling of the stellar absorption lines ; comparison with starburst spectra with ages between 3  myr and 7  myr did not show a significant difference , so we adopted the model which corresponded to the age determined from the h@xmath23 equivalent widths .",
    "most of the absorption lines detected in the spectrum are due to interstellar gas in our galaxy or ngc 4395 .",
    "however , several stellar absorption lines , notably from c  iii , s  iv , p  v and si  iv , are clearly present ( we could not detect o  vi absorption because it is filled in with emission from the agn ) .",
    "the strengths of these lines are similar in ngc 4395 and in the model spectrum . a subtraction of the starburst plus power law model from the spectrum of ngc  4395 ( bottom panel of figure 1 )",
    "successfully removes the strongest stellar and large - scale continuum features , leaving residuals primarily due to interstellar absorption and nuclear emission lines .",
    "based on all the tests presented in this section , we conclude that a starburst is the correct explanation for the excess emission observed by fuse .",
    "this turns out to have important consequences for the detection of intrinsic absorption in the _ fuse _ aperture (  5.3 ) .",
    "due to the relative faintness of ngc 4395 , its stis spectra are noisier than the stis echelle spectra of other seyfert galaxies that we have studied in the past ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element is s / n @xmath25 2.3 in the regions of broad c  iv emission surrounding the intrinsic absorption , whereas s / n @xmath13 8 in these regions for similar exposure times in ngc  5548 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "for the _ fuse _ spectra , we estimate s / n @xmath13 3 ( per resolution element ) in the o  vi region . since intrinsic absorption lines are expected to encompass many resolution elements ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , we smoothed the spectra by a 7-point boxcar function to search for absorption lines .",
    "figure 2 shows portions of the stis echelle spectra in regions where we have detected absorption lines that are likely to be intrinsic to ngc  4395 . from the narrow emission lines of the c  iv doublet seen in the top panel ,",
    "we have determined an emission - line redshift of @xmath32 0.0012 , close to the value of 0.0011 determined from h  i 21-cm emission by haynes et al .",
    "we note that these emission lines are unusually narrow compared to those of normal seyfert galaxies ; for c  iv the fwhm is 65 km s@xmath0 , similar to the value of @xmath450 km  s@xmath0 determined for various narrow emission lines from a high - resolution optical spectrum of ngc  4395 ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the n  v @xmath331238.8 , 1242.8 region is very noisy , and no absorption ( not even galactic ) was detected in this region .",
    "strong , broad galactic ly@xmath23 absorption prevents detection of any intrinsic ly@xmath23 absorption .",
    "most of the absorption lines that we have detected in the stis spectra can be attributed to the galaxy , at a radial velocity of @xmath129 km s@xmath0 in the observed frame ( @xmath1389 km s@xmath0 in figure 2 ) .",
    "however , we have identified two possible kinematic components of absorption that could be intrinsic to ngc  4395 .",
    "component 1 at @xmath1770 km s@xmath0 ( with respect to @xmath32 0.0012 ) is only evident in the c  iv @xmath21548.2 line .",
    "the associated c  iv @xmath21550.8 line is blended with galactic absorption , so we regard this identification as tentative .",
    "there is little or no low - ionization gas associated with this component ; in particular , there is no obvious mg  ii absorption .",
    "component 2 at @xmath1114 km s@xmath0 is seen in the lines of c  iv @xmath331548.2 , 1550.8 , si  iv @xmath331393.8 , 1402.8 , mg  ii @xmath332796.3 , 2803.5 , and o  i @xmath21302.2 ( also c  ii @xmath21334.5 , which is not shown ) .",
    "although the lines from component 2 do not align perfectly , it is not possible to determine if this is due to ion - dependent velocity structure or just noise .",
    "component 2 appears to be heavily saturated in all lines except for c  iv . in the top panel of figure 2 , we have overplotted the 1992 fos spectrum ( corrected to match the stis spectrum by adding 2   to the wavelength scale ) .",
    "the two broad dips in the fos spectrum correspond to our claims of absorption features at 1544 and 1550   ( filippenko , ho , & sargent 1993 ; kraemer et al .",
    "1999 ) . these can now be attributed to blends of the intrinsic and galactic absorption lines that we have identified in the stis spectrum , plus some contribution of the gap between the narrow c  iv emission doublet to the dip at 1550   ( @xmath34 300 km s@xmath0 in the plot ) .",
    "figure 3 shows portions of the _ fuse _ spectra . due to the low s /",
    "n at short wavelengths , we were unable to detect even galactic absorption in the expected lines of c  iii @xmath2977.0 and n  iii @xmath2989.8 . however , ly@xmath3 and c  ii @xmath21036.3 are clearly present in component 2 .",
    "the ly@xmath3 absorption at component 2 is not just the wing of the galactic component , since symmetric absorption is not present on the other ( more negative ) side of geocoronal ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "as the top panel of figure 3 shows , we have not detected o  vi absorption in any component , despite the reasonably decent s / n ( the absorption near the expected locations of components 1 and g in o  vi @xmath21037.6 is due to c  ii , as shown in the bottom panel ) .    to further characterize the absorption components , we have measured their radial velocity centroids and equivalent widths ( ews ) assuming full coverage of the continuum and line emission .",
    "we determined uncertainties in the absorption measurements from photon statistics and different reasonable placements of the continuum and emission - line profiles .",
    "since these data are too noisy to determine covering factors and ionic column densities from the optical depths of the lines , we have estimated column densities for components 1 and 2 from the ews of the lines . as mentioned previously ,",
    "nearly all of the detected lines appear to be saturated , so we used the ews to calculate lower limits to their columns .",
    "since c  iv does not appear to be saturated in component 2 , we give an actual value and estimated error for its column .",
    "note that if the covering factor for c  iv is significantly less than one , which seems unlikely given the depths of the other lines in this component , the quoted value for the c  iv column density is a lower limit .",
    "our measurements are summarized in table 1 .",
    "in addition to the velocity centroids and ews for component 2 , we list the corresponding galactic values for comparison . for the galactic component ,",
    "the average velocity centroid is @xmath129 ( @xmath2020 ) km s@xmath0 in the observed frame . for component 2 ,",
    "the average velocity centroid is @xmath1114 ( @xmath2021 ) km s@xmath0 with respect @xmath32 0.0012 , and the fwhm of the unsaturated c  iv absorption is 60 ( @xmath2022 ) km s@xmath0 .",
    "if component 1 is real and outflowing with respect to z @xmath25 0.0012 , we estimate a radial velocity and fwhm of @xmath1770 ( @xmath2021 ) and 130 ( @xmath2030 ) km s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "an ew of 0.84 ( @xmath200.21 )   gives a lower limit of 2.0 ( @xmath20 0.5 ) @xmath18 10@xmath35 @xmath22 for the c iv column density in component 1 .",
    "in general , the absorption components that we have detected could arise in 1 ) our galaxy ( disk or halo ) , 2 ) the ism of ngc  4395 , 3 ) the nlr of ngc  4395 , 4 ) outflowing uv absorbers similar to those found in most seyfert 1 galaxies , or 5 ) x - ray absorbers , characterized by higher ionization parameters than those of typical uv absorbers ( crenshaw et al .",
    "we detect a number of absorption lines from the galaxy ( component `` g '' ) at an observed radial velocity of @xmath129 km s@xmath0 ; their ews are similar to those found in other studies of galactic absorption ( savage & sembach 1994 ) .",
    "since the redshift of ngc 4395 is low , and absorption lines from the galactic halo can appear at radial velocities of several hundreds of km s@xmath0 in the observed frame , we need to consider the possibility of a galactic origin for the other absorption components .",
    "we rule out a galactic origin for component 2 , at a radial velocity of @xmath34246 km s@xmath0 in the observed frame , since at the galactic coordinates for ngc  4395 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , all of the high - velocity hi ( wakker 1991 ) and o  vi ( sembach et al . 2003 ) clouds detected in this area of the sky have negative radial velocities ( wakker 1991 ) .",
    "component 1 is at a radial velocity @xmath1410 km s@xmath0 in the observed frame ; although it could conceivably originate in the galactic halo , its velocity is at least 100 km s@xmath0 more negative than other h  i and o  vi halo clouds in this area of the sky ( wakker 1991 ; sembach et al .",
    "also , we would expect to see detectable si  iv for this component if it were halo gas ( savage & sembach 1994 ) , and none is apparent ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that these two components do not arise from the galaxy .    given an intrinsic origin for components 1 and 2 , the distinction between the above sources may seem somewhat ambiguous .",
    "for example , some outflowing uv absorbers are likely a component of the nlr ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001 ) , while others have been linked to x - ray absorbers , such that the uv absorption lines are due to trace elements in the highly ionized , high - column gas ( mathur et al . 1994 ; kraemer et al . 2002 ) . for this discussion ,",
    "the intrinsic absorption components are placed into the general category of outflowing uv absorber if they are not consistent with an origin in the other categories , which have been well characterized in ngc 4395 by other studies , as discussed in the following subsections .",
    "first , we need to consider whether or not component 1 is `` real , '' given the detection of one c  iv absorption line in noisy data .",
    "on the positive side , there is an inflection in the fos spectrum at this position that appears to be distinct from the inflection caused by the galactic c  iv @xmath21548.2 line ( figure 2 ) . on the negative side ,",
    "no other lines have been detected , and in particular , ly@xmath3 appears to be absent at the radial velocity of component 1 .",
    "we have been unable to devise a photoionization model that would result in an undetectable ly@xmath3 line , since even very highly ionized gas will have a substantial h  i column . assuming the c  iv absorption is real , the associated ly@xmath3 absorption must be diluted by unabsorbed uv continuum emission in the _ fuse _ aperture , which we characterized in  3 .    the high radial velocity of component 1 ( @xmath1770 km s@xmath0 ) with respect to ngc  4395 rules out an origin in the ism of this galaxy .",
    "as can be seen in figures 2 and 3 , the wings of the narrow components of the emission lines do not extend past about @xmath20100 km s@xmath0 from line center , so an origin in the nlr is ruled out as well . as discussed in  5.3 , the x - ray absorbers characterized by sh2003 are too highly ionized to produce significant columns of c  iv or lower - ionization species .",
    "thus , component 1 likely originates in an outflowing uv absorber , which is defined by the presence of c  iv absorption that is blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the absence of si  iv and lower ionization lines is not a problem for this interpretation , since most uv absorbers are too highly ionized to have substantial columns of these ions ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 , 2003a ) . in this case",
    ", one would expect detectable ( and likely saturated ) columns of o  vi and h  i , which are not seen at the position of component 1 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the expected o  vi and ly@xmath3 absorption lines are likely `` hidden '' by a substantial contribution from unabsorbed uv continuum emission , as demonstrated in  5.3 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our measurements of component 2 with those of the galactic component in table 1 .",
    "since component 2 is close to the systemic velocity ( although with a slight blueshift ) , it could arise from the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "however , an origin in the nlr or x - ray absorbers can not be ruled out by the kinematics alone , since the radial velocity of component 2 ( @xmath1114 km s@xmath0 ) is consistent with the small widths of the narrow emission lines , and we have no constraints on the kinematics of the x - ray absorbers .",
    "we can obtain further insight by comparing the ews of the lines from component 2 with those of the galaxy . in table 1 ,",
    "the ews of the low - ionization lines are very similar , whereas those of the higher ionization lines of si  iv and c  iv are about half the values of their galactic counterparts .",
    "component 2 could therefore arise from the ism of ngc 4395 , assuming it has a smaller amount of high - ionization gas than the galactic column along this particular line of sight .",
    "moreover , we can rule out an origin in photoionized gas , regardless of whether it is the nlr , uv absorbers , or x - ray absorbers .",
    "the key is the ratio of n(si  iv)/n(c  iv ) which is @xmath19 1.5 .",
    "given a power - law continuum and the abundances in  5.3 , we are unable to reproduce this ratio with photoionization models covering a broad range in ionization parameter and hydrogen column density .",
    "our models predict this ratio should always be @xmath38 0.3 , primarily due to the abundance ratio . however , n(si",
    "iv)/n(c  iv ) ratios as high as @xmath41 can be found in galactic halo gas ( savage & sembach 1994 ) , which is primarily collisionally ionized .",
    "a final point in favor of an ism origin is that the c  ii and ly@xmath3 lines for component 2 in the fuse spectrum are saturated near the zero flux level .",
    "if these lines originated solely in either the nlr ( with an angular size @xmath3904 , filippenko et al . 1993 ) or absorbers near the nucleus , the extra far - uv flux in the large _ fuse _ aperture would make them appear much shallower .",
    "we have generated photoionization models to further explore the possibility that the x - ray absorbers in ngc  4395 produce observable uv absorption lines .",
    "a long ( 640 ks ) _ asca _ observation from 2000 revealed an underlying continuum characterized by a photon index @xmath40 @xmath13 1.46 , modified by a large column of gas intrinsic to ngc 4395 , which sh2003 modeled as a two - zoned x - ray absorber .",
    "the zone closer to the nucleus was highly variable while the ionization state and total column density of the outer zone remained relatively constant during their observation",
    ". both of the components are highly ionized , and their observed effect is a depression of the continuum below @xmath4 3 kev , due to the combined effects of the bound - free edges of species such as o  vii , o  viii , ne  ix , and ne  x. notably , in their 17 ks _",
    "chandra _ spectrum , moran et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also found evidence for complex absorption , although these data are of insufficient quality to tightly constrain the physical characteristics of the absorber .",
    "the large column densities predicted by sh2003 suggest that detectable columns of h  i and o  vi may arise within the x - ray absorber . to calculate these column densities , we used the photoionization code cloudy90 ( ferland et al . 1998 ) to regenerate the constant component from sh2003 , which has a lower ionization than the variable component , and thus includes a larger fraction of the lower ionization species . for their models",
    ", sh2003 assumed that the x - ray continuum , with a spectral index @xmath23 @xmath25 0.46 , extends to lower energies without turning up to meet the uv , which severely underpredicts the uv continuum .",
    "therefore , we assumed a model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) closer to that which we derived for our emission - line study ( kraemer et al .",
    "1999 ) , with the form f @xmath41 @xmath42 , where @xmath43 for 13.6 @xmath44 1000 ev , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 1000 ev .",
    "sh2003 use the ionization parameter @xmath47 ( in erg cm s@xmath0 ) , which is 395.3 @xmath18 u for their adopted sed , where u is the number of ionizing photons per h atom .",
    "based on our sed , we fixed the flux at 0.5 kev in order to predict the same h - like and he - like o and ne columns , and hence the same opacity near 1 kev .",
    "this results in a factor of 28.5 increase in u , due to the larger number of euv photons .",
    "so for the constant component of the x - ray absorber modeled by sh2003 , their value @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath49 .    assuming solar abundances , sh2003 derive a total hydrogen column density n@xmath50 @xmath22 , for the constant component of the absorber . however , in our emission - line study ( kraemer et al .",
    "1999 ) , we determined that the heavy element abundances in the nlr of ngc 4395 were sub - solar , with most elements @xmath4 1/2 solar by number with respect to h , and n / h @xmath13 1/6 solar .",
    "therefore , in order to reproduce the x - ray opacity from the sh2003 model , we increased the total column density to n@xmath51 @xmath22 .",
    "we assumed that the x - ray absorber is free of cosmic dust and all elements are in the gas phase .    in table 2 , we compare our predictions of ionic column densities from models using the sh2003 sed and our revised sed .",
    "the high - ionization columns derived from the x - ray observations are essentially the same .",
    "however , the h  i and o  vi column densities are factors of @xmath417 and @xmath44 smaller , respectively , in the model that uses our more realistic sed , due to the much larger flux of uv photons .",
    "nevertheless , these columns are still quite large , and should be detectable in the _ fuse _ band if the entire source of uv continuum emission is covered .",
    "our revised sed model predicts undetectable columns of c  iv ( 3.4 @xmath18 10@xmath52 @xmath22 ) and other low - ionization lines , so these lines in components 1 and 2 are not from the x - ray absorbers .",
    "so where are the expected h  i and o  vi absorption lines from the x - ray absorbers of sh2003 ? given their column densities from our revised sed model in table 2 , we have generated simulated absorption - line profiles to determine if they would be detectable in the _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , we assumed that the x - ray component has the radial velocity and fwhm ( @xmath25 60 km s@xmath0 ) of component 2 . in figure 3 , we overplot the simulated absorption lines for two cases : complete covering of the uv continuum and 50% covering in the line of sight .",
    "the latter comes from assuming that the broad - line emission is covered and that the excess continuum flux in the _ fuse _ is not , resulting in a continuum covering factor of 0.33 and an effective covering factor of @xmath40.5 at the component 2 positions .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates that for complete covering , the ly@xmath3 absorption from the x - ray absorber would be detectable , unless it is hidden in the low - ionization gas associated with component 2 or filled in by geocoronal ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "o  vi absorption at full covering would be detectable at component 2 or any other velocity , unless it is fortuitously covered by the narrow o  vi emission at the systemic velocity of ngc 4395 , in which case it would not be outflowing . for the case of 50% covering , the h  i and",
    "o  vi absorption could be present at component 2 or any other radial velocity , given the noise level of the _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "thus , although we do not detect the expected o  vi and h  i absorption lines , the _ fuse _ spectra are not inconsistent with the parameters derived for the x - ray absorbers by sh2003 .",
    "we confirm the detection of c  iv absorption in ngc  4395 , and have identified a number of other absorption lines in new high - resolution _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra .",
    "in addition to galactic lines , we have identified two components that are likely to be intrinsic to ngc  4395 .",
    "component 1 at @xmath1770 km s@xmath0 ( with respect to @xmath32 0.0012 ) is only detected in the c  iv @xmath21548.2 line .",
    "if it is real , it can not arise in the ism or nlr of ngc  4395 due to its high velocity .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray absorbers characterized by sh2003 are too highly ionized to produce a detectable c  iv column .",
    "thus , component 1 likely originates in an outflowing uv absorber similar to those seen in most seyfert 1 galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "observations at higher s / n are required to confirm the reality of this component , and identify additional lines ( e.g. , n  v @xmath331238.8 , 1242.8 ) to characterize its physical conditions .",
    "the possibility that component 1 arises from uv absorbers close to the nucleus , for example in an accretion - disk wind ( e.g. , proga 2003 ) , remains an intriguing prospect , given the low luminosity of the central continuum source .",
    "drawing on the analogy with uv absorbers in normal seyfert 1s , possible indicators of a location close to the nucleus would be variability in the absorption lines or partial covering of the continuum and/or blr .",
    "these measurements require high - resolution spectra at higher s / n than the current data .",
    "component 2 shows a broad range in ionization , and likely arises in the ism of ngc  4395 , since photoionization models can not match the observed n(si  iv)/n(c  iv ) ratio , and the c  ii and ly@xmath3 absorption lines absorb all of the far - uv flux in the large ( 30@xmath17 @xmath18 30@xmath17 ) _ fuse _ aperture .",
    "it is interesting that this component shows a slight outflow ( @xmath1114 km s@xmath0 ) with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "this may indicate a large - scale galactic outflow driven by stellar winds and/or supernovae ( veilleux et al .",
    "2002 ) near the center of the galaxy .",
    "we have not detected the nlr in absorption , despite its large derived covering factor ( kraemer et al .",
    "this could be due to the overall geometry of the nlr or to clumpiness on a smaller scale ( i.e. , there is no nlr `` cloud '' in the line of sight to the continuum source ) .",
    "however , we note that absorption from the `` outer '' component of the nlr in kraemer et al . could be hidden in component 2 ( the other nlr components have saturated c  iv columns ) if it shares the same outflow velocity as the ism .",
    "we also do not detect the expected columns of o  vi and ly@xmath3 absorption from the x - ray absorbers claimed by sh2003 .",
    "this is likely due to a large contribution of hot stars to the far - uv flux in the _ fuse _ aperture , although x - ray observations at higher s / n and spectral resolution would be helpful for confirming the presence and properties of the x - ray absorption .",
