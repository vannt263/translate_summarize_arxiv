    "although the wti is necessary for gauge - invariance , it is not a sufficient condition ; further , with many of these vertex _ anstze _ the fermion propagator dse is not multiplicatively renormalizable , which is equivalent to saying that overlapping logarithms are present .",

    "dong , munczek and roberts @xcite subsequently showed that the lack of exact gauge - covariance of the solutions is in part due to the use of a hard cutoff in the integral equations .",
