    "until recently , the location of galactic red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the h - r diagram was poorly matched by stellar evolutionary tracks ( massey 2003 ) , with evolutionary theory failing to produce stars as cool and luminous as those  observed .",
    "\" many possible explanations might contribute to this discrepancy : there is poor knowledge of rsg molecular opacities , the near - sonic velocities of the convective layers invalidate simplifications of mixing length theory , and the highly extended atmospheres of these stars differ from the plane - parallel geometry assumption adopted by evolutionary models . in truth , the disagreement between theory and observation lay not in deficiencies of theory , but in an incorrect placement of rsgs in the h - r diagram .",
    "levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter paper  i ) used the new generation of marcs atmosphere models ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 , plez et al .",
    "1992 , plez 2003 , gustafsson et al .",
    "2003 ) to fit moderate - resolution optical spectrophotometry of 74 galactic rsgs .",
    "the newly derived physical parameters were in excellent agreement with the geneva evolutionary tracks for solar metallicity ( meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "a similar problem is known to exist for rsgs in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldhrd ] , where the data are from massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , and is based upon the best available calibration at the time .",
    "one can see that the evolutionary tracks do not extend to cool enough temperatures to reproduce the  observed \" ( assumed ) location in the h - r diagram .",
    "in addition , there is a long - standing mystery as to why the distribution of rsg spectral subtypes in the mcs is skewed towards earlier types in the mcs ( elias et al .  1985 ) , with the average rsg being k5-k7 in the smc , m1 in the lmc , and m2 in the milky way ( massey & olsen 2003 ) .",
    "the spectral subtype of late k- and m - type stars is largely determined on the basis of the strengths of the tio bands , which are highly sensitive to temperature , but their strengths will obviously also depend upon the chemical abundances .",
    "massey & olsen ( 2003 ) proposed that the change in the distribution of spectral types was due to the lower abundances found in the clouds ( @xmath2 for the smc , and @xmath3=0.5 for the lmc ; see westerlund 1997 and discussion in massey et al .",
    "2004 ) ; i.e. , that a 3800  k star would simply appear to be of earlier spectral type in the smc because of the lower abundance of tio . alternatively , as suggested by elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , it is possible that stars evolve to cooler temperatures at higher metallicities than at lower , since the  hayashi limit \" ( the maximum radius as a function of mass ) decreases with metallicity ( hayashi & hshi 1961 ; see also sugimoto & nomoto 1974 ) .",
    "understanding the physical properties of red supergiants at the low metallicities that characterize the magellanic clouds is of particular importance .",
    "such data can be combined with that of other galaxies in the local group for a sensitive test of stellar evolutionary models as a function of metallicity .",
    "observationally , the relative number of rsgs and wolf - rayet stars appear to change by a factor of @xmath4100 over 0.8  dex in metallicity ( massey 2002 , 2003 ) , in accordance with the suggestion first made by maeder et al .",
    "in addition , the number ratio of rsgs to blue supergiants will be much higher at low metallicities ( van den bergh 1973 ) , although there are challenges in determining this ratio quantitatively ( massey 2002 ) . in the milky way ,",
    "rsgs contribute only a few percent to the dust content of the interstellar medium , but in starburst galaxies , or galaxies at large look - back times , we expect that rsgs will play a major role ( massey et al .",
    "2005a ) , as such galaxies are usually metal - poor .",
    "finally , the mcs represent a relatively  clean \" environment , with minimal and uniform reddenings , which avoid some of the difficulties inherent in studying rsgs in the milky way ( paper i ) .",
    "oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( 1998 , 1999 ) used an earlier version of the marcs models ( bessell et al .",
    "1998 ) with their own spectrophotometry and ccd photometry to analyze a large sample of lmc stars .",
    "they conclude that the marcs models did the best of the then - available models at fitting the data , and derived physical properties using these fits .",
    "our work here was partially inspired by this work , and offers the following improvements .",
    "first , the marcs models used here ( and in paper i ) have been substantially revised .",
    "these now include sphericity , with an order of magnitude increase in the number of opacity sampling points , incorporate improved atomic opacities ( both line and continuum ) , and also include improved molecular opacities ( e.g. , cn , ch ) .",
    "second , there is now improved broad - band photometry available for _ both _ the lmc and smc thanks to 2mass and the recent ccd survey of massey ( 2002 ) .",
    "also , our sample consists of stars whose radial velocities have been shown to be consistent with membership in the magellanic clouds by massey & olsen ( 2003 ) .",
    "this list extends to stars which have cooler effective temperatures than do any of the oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( 1998 , 1999 ) lmc stars .",
    "in addition , our sample includes smc rsgs , providing important tests at even lower metallicities .",
    "since we use the same techniques , quality of data , and modeling for rsgs in all three galaxies , differences in the derived physical properties are likely to reflect real differences , and not just methodology .    here",
    "we present moderate - resolution spectrophotometry of 36 lmc rsgs and 39 smc rsgs (   [ sec - obs ] ) . from these data we determine spectral types (   [ sec - types ] ) , and derive physical parameters of rsgs in each of the clouds (   [ sec - analysis ] ) . as a test of the consistency of the marcs models ,",
    "we compare these to what we would derive purely on the basis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 colors (   [ sec - phot ] ) . in   [ sec - results ] we discuss our results : we compare the extinction found for our stars to that of ob stars in the clouds (   [ sec - reddening ] ) , compare the newly derived physical properties to those predicted by stellar evolution theory (   [ sec - evol ] ) , and compare the effective temperature scales for the magellanic cloud rsgs to that of the milky way (   [ sec - met ] ) . in   [ sec - sum ] we summarize our results , and lay out the directions for our future work .",
    "our stars are listed in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "the sample is drawn from massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , who relied upon radial velocities to distinguish foreground dwarfs from mc rsgs .",
    "we expect that contamination by red giants in the halo ( which would occupy a similar color and magnitude range ) will be low , only a few percent , but such stars would be hard to distinguish from mc supergiants , as most of the radial velocity of the clouds is simply due to the reflex motion of the sun .",
    "the optical photometry and positions come from massey ( 2002 ) , while the @xmath5 values are from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) database .",
    "the preliminary spectral types assigned by massey & olsen ( 2003 ) were used to ensure that a good range of spectral subtypes were observed in each cloud .",
    "some additional stars were observed in each cloud , but lacked complete spectral coverage , and these stars will be discussed separately once complete data are acquired . in addition , we observed a few galactic rsgs from paper  i to use in classifying the magellanic cloud stars , and to act as a check on our fluxes ; this later turned out to be valuable , as detailed below .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic data with the r - c spectrograph on the ctio blanco 4-meter telescope during six nights ( ut 2004",
    "november 23 - 25 , 1 - 2 dec , 4 dec ) , using the blue air schmidt camera and loral 3k ccd .",
    "we used a slit width of 375 @xmath6 m ( 2.5 \" ) , which projected to roughly 3.8 pixels on the detector . in the blue we used a 632 l mm@xmath7 grating (  kpgl1 `` ) blazed at 4200   for coverage from 3550  - 6420   in first order at 1.01   pixel@xmath7 , with a gg-345 blocking filter to block any second - order light . in the red we used a 632 l mm@xmath7 grating (  kpglf '' )",
    "blazed at 8400  for coverage 6130  - 9100   in first order at 1.04    pixel@xmath7 , with a gg-495 blocking filter to block any second - order light .",
    "the spectral resolution was 3.8   for both setups .",
    "observations in the blue were obtained on four nights ( 23 - 25 nov 2004 , 2 dec 2004 ) , and observations in the red on two nights ( 1 , 4 dec 2004 ) .",
    "the chip was binned by 2 pixels in the spatial direction , resulting in a scale of 1.0 arsec pixel@xmath7 .",
    "all observations were made with the slit oriented near the parallactic angle .",
    "conditions ranged from moderate cirrus to clear during the run , with seeing of 1.2 - 2.0 arcsec .",
    "typical exposure times were 300 s in the blue , and 200 s in the red .",
    "bias frames were obtained each evening after the dewar was filled .",
    "flat field calibration was obtained by taking projector flats at the beginning of each night ; dome flats yielded similar solutions .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained by taking exposures of a he - ne - ar calibration source throughout the night .",
    "observations of spectrophotometric standards were made throughout the night , and we also included in our program several galactic spectral standards , in common with our galactic program ( paper i ) .",
    "we reduced the data using image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "each frame was corrected for the bias level by a value determined from the overscan region , and then corrected for the ( negligible ) two - dimensional bias structure determined from average bias exposures for each night .",
    "a low - order function was fit in the dispersion direction to normalize the average of the flat - field exposures , and the normalized flat was then divided into each frame on a nightly basis .",
    "the spectra were extracted using an optimal extraction algorithm , and then wavelength corrected .",
    "the spectrophotometric standards were used to construct sensitivity curves for each night .",
    "a grey - shift of each standard was allowed , and typically resulted in an rms of 0.01 - 0.02  mag for the six or seven standard observations made each night .",
    "the standards bracketed the range of airmasses for which the program objects were observed , and standard values were assumed for the extinction .",
    "as noted above , we observed a few galactic rsgs from paper  i to act as spectral standards , and to serve as a consistency check on our data .",
    "given the good agreement of the spectrophotometric standard star observations , we were quite surprised to find that several of the galactic rsgs differed quite significantly in the near ultra - violet ( nuv ) fluxes , particularly below 3800 , from what we had found in paper  i. the spectrophotometric standards agreed very well in this region , and yet the same disagreement was seen when comparing the new data to those obtained on either the kitt peak 2.1-m or ctio 1.5-m telescopes ( paper i ) .",
    "we finally determined that the problem was inherent to the data , and not the reduction techniques .",
    "the new data all had extra flux in the nuv .",
    "we eventually noticed a strong correlation with color : the reddest red supergiants had the largest discrepancy .",
    "we also found that there was unexpected structure to the nuv flux , and in particular that there was a feature at 3810  which looked remarkably like the telluric a - band at 7620 , i.e. , at exactly twice the wavelength of the nuv feature .",
    "the conclusion was obvious : somehow the flux at a given wavelength was being affected by the flux at twice the wavelength .",
    "of course , since we had been observing with a first - order grating in the blue , this is not the sort of typical order - separation problem that come with the lack or misuse of blocking filters . by subtracting our spectrophotometry",
    "obtained in paper i from the current data , and comparing that to the counts in the red , we established that there was a few percent ghost of 2@xmath8 light contaminating our observations .",
    "the problem does not show up with stars of normal colors ( such as that of the spectrophotometric standards ) , but becomes significant for the extremely red stars we observed .",
    "tests by k.a.g.o . and",
    "p.m. in march 2005 using the comparison arcs and various blocking filters established beyond any doubt that this 632 l mm@xmath7 grating also acts as a 316 l mm@xmath7 grating , albeit at a low level .",
    "another replica of this grating has been in use for many years with the kitt peak 4-m rc spectrograph (  kpc-007 \" ) . after our discovery , di harmer kindly conducted a similar test with it , and found that it suffers from the same problem .",
    "we determined an empirical correction factor , which amounted to several percent of the 2@xmath8 count - rate , and applied that to all of our data .",
    "the spectrophotometric standards yielded the identical solutions .",
    "the correction is significant ( greater than a few percent ) only below 4000 .",
    "so as to not compromise the results of the present study , we restrict ourselves only to data long - wards of 4100 .",
    "since rsgs can vary in spectral type , and since our current spectra have higher signal - to - noise than those of massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , we chose to reclassify all of the magellanic cloud stars in our sample .",
    "this reclassification was based primarily on the tio band depths , which are visible even for the early and mid ks ( specifically the @xmath9 and @xmath10 tio lines ; see also jaschek & jaschek 1987 ) .",
    "we strove for consistency between the classifications used here and in paper i. the revised spectral types are compared to the older ones in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "our fitting of the spectrophotometry determines three properties of these stars : effective temperature @xmath11 , the visual extinction @xmath12 , and ( indirectly ) the surface gravity @xmath13 [ cgs ] . to accomplish this",
    ", we compared our observed spectral energy distribution to a series of marcs stellar atmosphere models .",
    "the models were computed for a metallicity @xmath2 ( smc ) , and @xmath14 ( lmc ) . of course , the assumption that the abundances of all elements scale with a single  metallicity \" value is a simplification , but may be a good approximation : see , for example pritzl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who find that solar - like ratios of alpha - products to fe are common even in very metal - poor systems . in any event",
    ", this serves as a useful starting point for determining the effect that chemical abundances have on the physical parameters of these stars .",
    "the models ranged from 3000  k to 4500  k in increments of 100  k and with @xmath15 values from -1 to + 1 , in increments of 0.5  dex .",
    "we interpolated the models for intermediate temperatures at 25 k increments . when making the fits , we reddened the models using a cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law with @xmath16 .",
    "although a high value of the _ effective _ ratio of selective - to - total extinction is needed to correct broad - band photometry of such red stars , the same @xmath17 that works for early - type stars will work for rsgs when dealing with optical spectrophotometry ; see massey et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .    none of the spectral features have an obvious surface gravity dependence , and so we used the same procedure as in paper  i to arrive at a final set of values .",
    "we began the fitting procedure with the @xmath18 models , and determined the reddening and effective temperatures that gave the best fit ( by eye ) both to the spectral features and to the continuum .",
    "these fits were unique and well - determined , with a precision of 50  k for the m stars and the mid - to - late k stars .",
    "for the earlier k stars , our fits were based primarily on tio @xmath9 and the g - band ; we estimate that the effective temperatures of these stars have been obtained to a precision of 100  k. the extinction values @xmath12 are determined to 0.15  mag .",
    "we next checked to see if the initial @xmath18 value was appropriate to that expected for the star : the bolometric corrections ( from the models ) were used with the reddening and photometry ( table  [ tab : stars ] ) to compute the bolometric luminosity , assuming true distance moduli of 18.9 ( smc ) or 18.5 ( lmc ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity and effective temperature define an effective radius , which is used with an estimate of the mass ( from a simple mass - luminosity relation determined from the geneva evolutionary models , and which remains valid at these lower metallicities ) to determine the physical @xmath15 .",
    "if these @xmath15 values were closer to + 0.5 or -0.5 than to our initial estimate of 0 , then the star was refit with a model with a more appropriate value for the surface gravity .",
    "the calculation was then repeated , although the results converged quickly . in practice a difference in the @xmath15 value had no effect on the effective temperature , but slightly changed the extinction estimate .",
    "see paper  i for more details .",
    "we show four sample fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : samples ] .",
    "the complete set is available in the on - line edition , and we are also making our spectra and the models available through the centre de donnees astronomiques de strasbourg s vizier server is likely due to the presence of the mg i triplet ( only partially resolved at our spectral resolution ) superimposed on the tio @xmath9 . decreasing the smoothing removes most of this slight discrepancy , but introduces other problems due to the finite sampling in producing the synthetic spectra .",
    "since this region was not used in fitting the models to the data , the disagreement in this region is cosmetic , and not indicative of a problem .",
    "we are indebted to the anonymous referee for raising this issue . ] .",
    "we give our final values in table  [ tab : results ] . in determining the bolometric luminosity we used the models to compute the bolometric correction at @xmath19 as a function of effective temperature for each galaxy .",
    "milky way : @xmath20    lmc : @xmath21    smc : @xmath22      although we expect that the tio molecular band strengths will be directly affected by the abundances , and hence that the calibration of effective temperature with spectral type will depend upon metallicity , it is less clear _ a priori _ how the calibration of effective temperature with broad - band photometry will depend upon the metallicity .",
    "josselin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have emphasized the usefulness of @xmath0 as a temperature indicator for galactic rsgs , and in paper  i we showed that reasonable agreement exists between the physical parameters derived from fitting the spectrophotometry with those derived from @xmath0 . in the optical ,",
    "@xmath1 is known to be a good temperature indicator , while @xmath23 is instead dominated by surface gravity effects ( massey 1998 ) due to line - blanketing by weak metal lines .      in fig .",

    "i , the @xmath19 bandpass comes from bessell ( 1990 ) , while the k bandpass comes from bessell & brett ( 1988 ) .",
    "solar metallicity is shown in black , with the lmc metallicity indicated by red , and the smc by green .",
    "the dispersion at each temperature is due to the range of @xmath15 .",
    "the three curves show the fit to all of the data for each galaxy ( @xmath11=3200 - 4300  k , @xmath240,+0.5 , and + 1.0 , when available ) . for simplicity we have indicated the @xmath18 models , which are the most typical of our sample , with filled circles .",
    "the dispersion with @xmath15 clearly increases with decreasing temperature , but is small for @xmath25 or @xmath26 3600  k. in this regime there is also little difference between the calibrations at different metallicities , with about a 30  k change ( smc minus milky way ) .",
    "the coolest stars in our magellanic cloud sample have @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 , for which the differences are -50  k ( smc minus milky way ) .",
    "the formal fits are given here :    milky way : @xmath29    lmc : @xmath30    smc : @xmath31    the rms of these fits are 11 k ( galactic ) , 17 k ( lmc ) , and 36 k ( smc ) , due primarily to the spread of @xmath15 .",
    "however , in practice none of the stars in our lmc and smc samples have extreme @xmath15 values , and as fig .",
    "[ fig : vmkfit](a ) shows , there is good agreement between our fits and the ( usual ) @xmath18 case indicated by the filled circles .    how does the sensitivity of @xmath11 to color compare to the sensitivity of spectral fitting ?",
    "as discussed above , we felt that the typical error for our mid - k to m stars was about 50  k. a reasonable error for @xmath0 might be 0.10  mag , given the need to correct for reddening , and we note that at 3800  k this change in color would correspond to about 35  k , smaller but comparable to the uncertainty in our spectral fitting .",
    "few of our magellanic cloud sample have  standard \" k - band photometry , but all have been observed by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) in their @xmath5 system ( i.e. , the @xmath32 values in table  1 ) .",
    "paper i cautioned that the two are not quite equivalent , and we have compared the  standard cit \" k - band photometry of elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) with the @xmath5 photometry found in the 2mass catalog .",
    "indeed , there is a small but non - negligible offset , with @xmath33 .",
    "this value comes from 41 smc stars , and has a small scatter ( rms of 0.06  mag ) ; it is similar to the conversion found by carpenter ( 2001 ) , who find @xmath34 .",
    "bessell & brett ( 1988 ) find that the transformation between their adopted k bandpass ( upon which our synthetic colors are based ) , and that of the cit system , amounts to a constant offset @xmath35 .",

    "( 2005a ) have ( re)emphasized the need to carefully consider the spectral energy distribution of the source when correcting broad - band photometry of rsgs ( see mccall 2004 for discussion of the general case ) .",

    "the dispersion is 0.01 for the galactic and lmc metallicity models , and 0.02 mag for the smc , where again the dispersion is mostly due to the effects of extreme surface gravities ( + 1 , -1 ) at low effective temperatures .",

    "josselin & plez ( 2005 ) showed that low excitation ir co lines in the k band computed using marcs models are too faint compared to observations of betelgeuse .",
    "also , alvarez et al .  ( 2000 ) , point out that their co index is larger in rsg than in other late - type giants .",
    "however , this co absorption not accounted for by the models can not be responsible for the difference of 40% in the k flux we find here , and seems to exclude an unknown opacity source in the k band .",
    "rather , the explanation might lie in the shortcomings of 1d static models .",
    "it was shown recently ( ryde et al .",
    "2005 ) that marcs models at the canonical @xmath11 = 3600  k for betelgeuse can not reproduce the ir h@xmath47o lines around 12@xmath6 m , while spectra generated with a @xmath11=3250  k do reproduce the observations . in the optical a temperature of 3600  k is more appropriate .",
    "radiative - hydrodynamical 3d models of rsg do show a pattern of large warm and cool patches on the surface ( freytag et al .",
    "2002 ) that may explain this wavelength dependent @xmath11 .",
    "we can readily provide a rough estimate , at the smc metallicity , of the impact on @xmath0 of an optical spectrum characterized by a @xmath11=3600  k ( ( @xmath48 ) and an ir spectrum characteristic of a lower @xmath11=3200  k ( @xmath49 ) . using two marcs models at these @xmath11 and taking their @xmath19 and @xmath39 magnitudes ,",
    "we find a composite @xmath50 , which corresponds to a marcs model at 3703  k. thus , using the @xmath0 would lead to a @xmath11=3700  k , while the fitting of tio bands would lead to @xmath11=3600  k. this explains a large part of the effect we observe , and would also impact the bolometric correction , but more detailed calculations are necessary with 3d models , or at least with patches of 1d models .      of the optical colors , @xmath1 has the greatest potential for being used for a temperature indicator ; see discussion in massey ( 1998 ) . by comparing the temperatures arrived at by @xmath1",
    "we may also obtain useful clues as to the source of the discrepancy we found when comparing the effective temperatures derived from @xmath0 (   [ sec - vmr ] ) with those found from fitting the optical spectrophotometry (   [ sec - teff ] ) .    using the bessell ( 1990 ) approximation for the ( johnson ) @xmath19 and ( cousins ) @xmath51 filters , we have computed the expected colors for each of the marcs models .",

    "the temperatures agree for the warmer rsgs ( 50  k difference at @xmath0=1.0 ) but disagree considerably for the coolest rsgs ( 200 k difference at @xmath0=1.5 ) .    according to schlegel et al .",

    "[ fig : vmrteffs](b ) we show the comparison between the bolometric luminosities .",
    "these agree extremely well , as expected , given the only slight offset in @xmath11 .",
    "we are forced to conclude that there is nothing wrong with our basic analysis technique , and that at present @xmath0 gives slightly inconsistent answers , probably due to the limitations of static 1d models .",
    "paper i noted that many of the rsgs in galactic ob associations show significantly higher reddening than the early - type stars in the same clusters and associations ; this matter was investigated more fully by massey et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , who demonstrated that this extra reddening was likely due to circumstellar dust , and amounted to as much as 4 - 5  mag of extra extinction at @xmath19 for stars with the highest dust mass - loss rates and highest bolometric luminosities .",
    "this was in accord with a simple calculation of how much extinction one would _",
    "expect _ just given the observed dust mass - loss rates and reasonable assumptions .",
    "the criticism is easily leveled that of course the galactic ob associations suffer from variable reddenings , and that such evidence is therefore somewhat dependent upon the sample selection .",
    "we vowed to reexamine this issue in the magellanic clouds , where the extinction is generally low , and uniform ( massey et al .",
    "1995 , van den bergh 2000 ) . of course",
    ", the lower metallicities of the clouds should result in lower dust mass - loss rates .",
    "we hope to measure the dust mass - loss rates ourselves using the _ spitzer space telescope ( sst ) _",
    ", , but even if this rate scales linearly with metallicity , we would expect to see rsgs with a considerable amount of extra extinction in the clouds .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : avs ] we compare the @xmath12 values found from our model fitting of rsgs to the distribution of reddenings for ob stars found by massey et al .",
    "clearly the excess reddening we expected to find is in fact present .",
    "the peaks are shifted by several tenths of a magnitude to higher values , and there are a significant number of stars with substantially more reddening than that .      with the improvements to the effective temperature scale given in paper  i , we found excellent agreement between the placement of rsgs in the h - r diagram and the locations of the stellar evolutionary tracks from the geneva group ( i.e. , meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "these tracks included new opacities , and spanned a range of initial rotational velocities ( 0 - 300 km s@xmath7 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd](a ) and ( b ) we make a similar comparison now using the results from fitting the optical spectrophotometry ( i.e. , table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    " modern \" models ( including rotation and the revised opacities ) are available at present only for higher masses for the lmc ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) , but a full set for the smc is available ( maeder & meynet 2002 ) .",
    "we complement these with the older geneva models , as shown in green ( schaerer et al .",
    "1993 for the lmc and charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 for the smc ) .",
    "we see that for the lmc there is now excellent agreement between the tracks and the  observed \" ( revised ) locations of rsgs in the h - r diagram . for the smc",
    "the agreement is poorer .",
    "first , the newer tracks do not extend to quite as low effective temperatures as do the data , although we note that the older tracks ( shown in green ) do . still , this discrepancy is small compared to the past ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oldhrd ] ) .",
    "more interesting is the large spread in effective temperatures of rsgs of a given luminosity in the smc compared to that in the lmc .",
    "this effect is just what is expected : maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) found that , in part because massive stars formed at low metallicity have relatively weak stellar winds , little angular momentum is removed and hence rotational mixing is of increased importance at low metallicites . in this case , the helium content of red supergiants depends strongly on the rotational velocities during the main - sequence phase , and at higher helium content the tracks stop at warmer temperatures .",
    "we can compare these two h - r diagrams to what would be obtained if instead we relied upon the @xmath0 calibration . as discussed above (   [ sec - vmk ] ) the @xmath0 calibration produces somewhat warmer temperatures than does the fitting of the optical spectrophotometry or those calculated from the broad - band @xmath1 colors .",
    "the results are similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "no matter which calibration is used , the agreement with the evolutionary tracks is satisfactory , and is a vast improvement over the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldhrd ] . and ,",
    "in either case the dispersion for the smc is considerably greater than that for the lmc .",
    "the new effective temperature scales are compared in table  [ tab : tscale ] , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tscale ] . for the k supergiants ,",
    "the scales agree to within the errors . for cooler stars ,",
    "the effective temperature scale is about 50  k cooler for lmc m - type supergiants than galactic m - type supergiants .",
    "it is about 150  k cooler for smc m - type supergiants than galactic m - type supergiants .",
    "what we find is that while an m2  i star in the milky way will have @xmath11=3660  k , a star of similar effective temperature in the lmc would be spectroscopically identified as an m1.5  i , i.e. , half a type earlier , purely due to the effect that metallicity has on the depth of the tio bands .",
    "a star with the same effective temperature in the smc would be spectroscopically identified as an m0  i , i.e. , two spectral subtypes earlier than in the milky way .",
    "this offers a partial , but incomplete , explanation for the shift in spectral subtypes first found by elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and confirmed by the more complete data of massey & olsen ( 2003 ) .",
    "massey & olsen ( 2003 ) found that the average spectral type of a rsg is m2  i in the milky way , m1  i in the lmc , and k5-k7  i in the smc .",
    "the spectral classifications given here are based upon better data , but the sample may be somewhat skewed towards later types . we find ( from table  [ tab : tscale ] ) that the average spectral type of stars in our sample is m2  i ( milky way ) , m1.5  i ( lmc ) and k3  i ( smc ) .",
    "thus , the change in the spectral appearance due to the change in abundance of tio might be enough to explain the small shift in spectral type from the milky way to the lmc , but it is _ not _ enough to explain the relative lack of red supergiants in the smc .",
    "instead , we must look to the stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "[ fig : compare ] compares the evolutionary tracks for @xmath59 ( milky way , shown in black ) , @xmath60 ( lmc , shown in red ) , and @xmath61 ( smc , shown in green ) .",
    "we see that there is a clear shift of the coolest tip of the tracks to warmer effective temperatures as the metallicity decreases .",
    "elias et al .  (",
    "1985 ) in fact attribute the shift of spectral subtypes to the effects of metallicity on the location of the red supergiant locus in the h - r diagram .",
    "the hayashi limit denotes the largest radius a star of a given mass can have and still be in hydrodynamic equilibrium ( hayashi & hshi 1961 ) .",
    "this line is nearly vertical in the h - r diagram , and shifts to warmer effective temperatures at lower metallicities ; we see the underlying physics reflected in the location of the coolest extent of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "consistent with our results above (   [ sec - evol ] ) , this shift _ is _ in accordance with what we need to explain the change in spectral subtype .",
    "for a 15 - 25  @xmath62 star we expect a shift in effective temperatures of red supergiants of about + 500 k from milky way ( black ) to smc ( green ) .",
    "this is actually larger than the required shift , about 350 k ( table  [ tab : tscale ] ) . from the milky way to the lmc the tracks shift by 100 to 150 k , in good agreement with the shift in average spectral type from m2 ( milky way ) to m1-m1.5 ( lmc ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the shift in the spectral type due to the abundance of tio is a secondary effect , and that the main reason that the spectral subtypes are earlier in the clouds than in the milky way is due to the shift of the hayashi limit with metallicity .",
    "this is in accordance with the speculation offered by elias et al .",
    "we have derived new physical properties of rsgs in the magellanic clouds , using the marcs stellar atmosphere models , following our treatment of galactic rsgs in paper i. we find that the effective temperatures of k supergiants are about the same in the smc , lmc , and milky way , but that the lower abundance of tio leads to effective temperatures that are about 50  k lower ( lmc ) and 150  k lower for m supergiants of the same spectral subtype . to put this in a more physical way , a star in the same place in the h - r diagram that is called an m2  i in the milky way , would be of m1.5  i type in the lmc , and m0  i in the smc .",
    "this is not sufficient to explain the shift with metallicity in the average spectral types between the milky way and the smc , where the average spectral types of rsgs change from m2  i to k3  i. instead , it is primarily the change in the hayashi limit with metallicity that is responsible .",
    "this agrees with the explanation offered by elias et al .  ( 1985 ) , who first observed the shift in type .",
    "although the marcs models give very good fits to the optical spectrophotometry , the results derived from this fitting do result in temperatures that are systematically cooler than those that would be derived from the observed @xmath0 colors .",
    "the median discrepancy is about -100  k for the milky way and the lmc , and -170  k for the smc .",
    "this systematic difference is likely due to the limitations of static 1d models .",
    "the @xmath1 colors produce temperatures that are more consistent with the optical spectrophotometry , with only a small offset ( -30  k ) for both the smc and the lmc .",
    "although we would of course prefer for all techniques to give perfect agreement , we can place this discrepancy into context .",
    "a 175  k difference in the effective temperature scale is a 4 - 5% effect . for comparison ,",
    "recent revisions to the effective temperatures of o - type stars have shifted the scale by 10% ( see discussion in massey et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "the rsgs in our sample show higher extinction on average than do the ob stars in the clouds ; this is consistent with our findings that many galactic rsgs have higher extinction than ob stars in the same clusters and associations ( paper i ) .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 2005a ) argue that this is a natural consequence of the fact that these stars are  smokey \" , and produce circumstellar dust .",
    "follow - up ground - based observations were successfully obtained in december 2005 to derive the extinction properties of this dust , and we hope to extend this work using the _ sst . _",
    "the newly derived properties provide an excellent match to stellar evolution tracks in the lmc , but there is significantly more scatter for the smc .",
    "this may be due to the larger effect that rotational mixing has in lower metallicity stars ( maeder & meynet , 2001 ) .",
    "the helium content of red supergiants is changes significantly ( typically by @xmath63 or more ) as a function of the rotation velocities during the main - sequence phase . a higher helium abundance results in the evolutionary tracks stopping at slightly warmer temperatures than in the absence of such enrichment",
    ". however , the amount of helium enrichment critically depends on the assumed physics of the models . in this context",
    ", observational determinations of the he / h ratios would be very useful indeed .    throughout this work we have made the approximation that the abundances of the smc and lmc scale by a single number , a fact which we know is not quite correct .",
    "( for a good discussion of this see venn 1999 and dufour 1984 . )",
    "as improved stellar models ( with improved opacities and which include the effects of rotation ) become available at the relevant mass range ( 10 - 20 @xmath62 ) we will better know what individual abundances to assume for the model atmospheres .",
    "in the meanwhile , we believe that the current study accurately represents the differential correction to the derived properties of rsgs",
    ". we also plan to extend this work to the metal - rich environment found in the andromeda galaxy .",

    "<S> we present moderate - resolution optical spectrophotometry of 36 red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the lmc and 39 rsgs in the smc . using the marcs stellar atmosphere models to fit this spectrophotometry </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the reddenings , effective temperatures and other physical properties , such as bolometric luminosity and effective stellar radii , and compare these to stellar evolutionary models . as a self - consistency check </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the broad - band colors @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the models . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 results are in good agreement with those from fitting the optical spectrophotometry , but the @xmath0 results show metallicity - dependent systematic differences , amounting to 3 - 4% in effective temperature , and 0.2  mag in bolometric luminosity , at the metallicity of the smc ; we conclude that this is likely due to the limitations of static 1d models , as spectra of rsgs in the optical and ir may reflect different atmospheric conditions due to the large surface granulation present in these stars . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the scales indicated by the optical spectrophotometry and @xmath1 colors , but accept that there is still some uncertainty in the absolute temperature scales . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effective temperature scales for the lmc and smc k - type supergiants agree with each other and with that of the milky way , while for m - type supergiants the scales are cooler than the galactic scale by 50  k and 150  k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is in the sense that one would expect : since the spectral classification of rsgs is based on the line strengths of tio , stars with lower abundances of these elements have to be cooler in order to have the same strength . </S>",
    "<S> however , this effect is not sufficient to explain the shift in average rsg spectral type between the three galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it is the effect that metallicity has on the coolest extent of the evolution of a star that is primarily responsible . </S>",
    "<S> our new results bring the rsgs into much better agreement with stellar evolutionary theory , although the smc rsgs show a considerably larger spread in effective temperatures at a given luminosity than do the lmc stars . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected due to the larger effects of rotational mixing in lower - metallicity stars , as higher helium abundance at the surface would lead to higher effective temperatures in the rsg phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the distribution of reddening of rsgs in the clouds is skewed significantly towards higher values , consistent with our recent finding that galactic rsgs show extra extinction due to circumstellar dust . </S>"
