    "massless qcd with two flavors undergoes a chiral symmetry restoration transition which is believed to be of second order . according to arguments by pisarski and wilczek @xcite the universality class of the transition is that of the dimensionally reduced @xmath0 @xmath1 heisenberg spin model .",
    "the reasoning behind their conjecture is that quantum fluctuations become irrelevant near the critical temperature @xmath2 . as @xmath3 the correlation length @xmath4 diverges and the characteristic mode is @xmath5 .",
    "the fermions are expected to decouple from the scalar sector because they do not have zero modes .",
    "the energy of the zero point quantum fluctuations of characteristic frequency @xmath6 , @xmath7 is much less than the thermal energy per degree of freedom @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in this regime one observes the critical behaviour of a classical ( thermal ) transition .",
    "however , there is a possible loophole in this scenario . in fermionic models the mesons are composite @xmath9 states whose density and size increase as @xmath3",
    "this may imply that the fermionic sub - structure is apparent on physical length scales and as a consequence we may have a maximal violation of the bosonic character of mesons near @xmath2 .",
    "if this is the case then the quarks become essential degrees of freedom irrespective of how heavy they are .    since the problem of chiral symmetry breaking and",
    "its restoration is intrinsically non - perturbative the number of techniques available is limited and most of our knowledge about this phenomenon comes from lattice simulations .",
    "various lattice results indicate that the qcd chiral phase transition at @xmath10 is second order @xcite",
    ". however , due to problems with finite size effects near the critical temperature and the proper inclusion of fermions on the lattice , these calculations are still not fully satisfactory .",
    "therefore , an important role is played by model field theories which incorporate various basic features of qcd and they are much easier to deal with .",
    "such a theory is the nambu@xmath11jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "the njl model was introduced in the sixties as a theory of interacting nucleons @xcite and later it was reformulated in terms of quark degrees of freedom . in the continuum , the model is described by the euclidean lagrangian density @xmath12 , \\label{lcont}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 are the pauli spin matrices which run over the internal @xmath14 isospin symmetry .",
    "the index @xmath15 runs over @xmath16 fermion colours and @xmath17 is the coupling constant of the four - fermion interaction .",
    "the model is chirally symmetric under @xmath18 ; @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent global @xmath14 rotations and the operators @xmath22 project onto left and right handed spinors respectively .",
    "it is also invariant under @xmath23 corresponding to a conserved baryon number .",
    "the theory becomes easier to treat , both analytically and numerically , if we introduce scalar and pseudo - scalar fields denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the bosonised lagrangian is @xmath26 the dynamic generation of fermion masses brought about by the breaking of chiral symmetry at @xmath17 larger than a critical @xmath27 is one of the important properties of the model .",
    "this implies the creation of the nambu - goldstone bosons ( @xmath28 ) and the creation of the chiral partner sigma ( @xmath24 ) which are @xmath9 bound states .",
    "the interaction strength has a mass dimension -2 , implying that the model is non - renormalizable .",
    "it works well in the intermediate scale region as an effective theory of qcd with a momentum cutoff comparable to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath29 1gev .",
    "various authors demonstarted the success of the model as a quantitative theory of hadrons ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was also shown that the model has an interesting phase diagram in the ( temperature , quark chemical potential @xmath30 ) plane , in close agreement with predictions from other effective field theories of qcd . in the hartree - fock approximation",
    ", the theory has a tricritical point in the @xmath31 plane @xcite when the quark current mass , the coupling @xmath32 and the momentum cut - off @xmath33 are chosen to have physically meaningful values .",
    "recently , lattice simulations showed that the ground - state at high @xmath30 and low @xmath34 is that of a traditional bcs superfluid @xcite .",
    "it was also shown numerically that the @xmath35-dimensional @xmath36 symmetric model undergoes a finite temperature phase transition which belongs to the @xmath37-dimensional ising model @xcite implying that the dimensional reduction scenario is the valid description of the thermal transition .",
    "here we study the case where the chiral symmetry is continuum .",
    "we performed lattice simulations of the njl model with the hybrid monte carlo method .",
    "details about the staggered fermion action used in our simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric lattice has @xmath38 lattice spacings @xmath39 in spatial directions , @xmath40 lattice spacings in the temporal direction and volume @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath42 .",
    "on a finite volume and with the quark bare mass set to zero , the direction of symmetry breaking changes over the course of the run so the chiral condensate averages to zero over the ensemble .",
    "another option is to introduce an effective order parameter @xmath43 , which in the thermodynamic limit is equal to the true order parameter @xmath44 extrapolated to zero quark mass . in order to study the critical behaviour on lattices available to us we use the finite size scaling ( fss )",
    "method , which is a well - established tool for studying critical properties of phase transitions . on a finite lattice",
    "the correlation lenght @xmath4 is limited by the size of the system and consequently no true criticality can be observed .",
    "the dependence of a given thermodynamic observable , @xmath45 , on the size of the box is singular and according to the fss hypothesis is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the standard exponent of the correlation length and @xmath49 is a scaling function , which is not singular at zero argument .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 is the standard critical exponent for the quantity @xmath45 .",
    "studying the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath38 and using eq .",
    "( [ fssx ] ) one can determine such exponents .",
    "we performed simulations with @xmath51 , fixed @xmath52 and @xmath53 at three or four values of @xmath54 for each lattice size and then used histogram reweighting techniques to calculate the values of the observables at nearby couplings .",
    "the temperature @xmath34 is varied by varying the lattice spacing @xmath55 .",
    "near @xmath56 the expansion of the fss scaling relation for the susceptibility @xmath57 is : @xmath58 for large enough @xmath38 one can neglect the terms in the first parenthesis . by fitting our data to eq .",
    "( [ susc ] ) we get : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "these results are in agreement with the @xmath0 @xmath1 spin model exponents @xcite @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    a method usually used to determine",
    "@xmath56 is by measuring the binder cumulant , @xmath64 as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ fssx ] ) , near @xmath56 , @xmath65 . in the large @xmath38 limit",
    "@xmath66 has a universal value @xmath67 at @xmath56 .",
    "close to @xmath56 , @xmath68 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 in the classical @xmath0 @xmath1 universality is 0.636(1 ) . fitting the above relation to data generated on lattices with @xmath69 we get @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the measured values of @xmath48 and @xmath67 are close to their respective values in the @xmath0 @xmath1 spin model .",
    "it has been shown analytically that in the infinite @xmath16 limit the theory undergoes a second order phase transition with landau - ginzburg mean field ( mf ) exponents for any dimensionality @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the reasoning behind this behaviour is that bosonic fluctuations are neglected , whereas the fermions decouple because their non - zero matsubara frequency acts as a mass term of order @xmath73 for the @xmath37-dimensional components of the field .",
    "however , as we showed in the previous paragraph for @xmath51 the dimensional reduction scenario is the correct description of the transition .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that although the fermions do not affect the actual critical behaviour they do affect the way the universal behaviour sets in .",
    "close to @xmath2 , mf theory is expected to break down and in the case of @xmath74 the non - trivial scaling region is suppressed by a factor @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "we perfomed simulations in the broken phase on @xmath76 lattices with @xmath51 and @xmath77 . in the mf region",
    "the order parameter @xmath78 is equal to the fermion mass and therefore acts as an inverse correlation length . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we plot @xmath79 versus @xmath54 .",
    "the data in the mf region fits well to straight lines because in this region the critical exponent for @xmath78 is @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath51 the quality of the linear fit deteriorates significantly when we include the @xmath81 point . for @xmath77",
    "all the @xmath82 data give a high quality fit , implying that in this case the crossover from the mf region to the @xmath0 @xmath1 region occurs at larger correlation lengths than for @xmath51 .",
    "this result verifies that the @xmath0 @xmath1 scaling region is suppressed at large @xmath16 .",
    "we also fitted the @xmath51 data for @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) to the scaling relation @xmath84 with fixed @xmath85 and extracted @xmath86 which is close to the @xmath0 @xmath1 exponent @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "we showed numerically that the njl model of qcd with two massless quarks undergoes a second order chiral phase transition which belongs to the @xmath0 @xmath1 spin model universality .",
    "furthemore , as shown some time ago in the @xmath88 @xmath36-symmetric gross - neveu model @xcite the actual critical region is suppressed if the number of fermion species in the system is large",
    ". it will be interesting to check with comparable precision whether this scenario is the correct description of the qcd thermal phase transition . +   + discussions with s. chandrasekharan , s. hands and j. kogut are greatly appreciated ."
