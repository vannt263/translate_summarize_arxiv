    "face centered cubic ( fcc ) iron - based alloys are widely used for developing of stainless austenitic steels especially for using in critical temperature ranges , aggressive environment and other severe external conditions .",
    "doping of these steels with light interstitial impurities ( c , n ) influence mechanics and kinetics of structure phase transitions in fe - based alloys .",
    "distribution of carbon and nitrogen atoms in solid solutions influence electrical and mechanical properties of alloys .",
    "nitrogen doping enables to solve the problem of the strengthening of stainless steels .",
    "investigation of the influence of nitrogen on physical properties of multicomponent systems is a complicated problem .",
    "the solution of this problem should be made in several stages .",
    "on the first stage it seems important to study electronic structure of iron nitride fe@xmath1n , because binary @xmath3-fen@xmath4 alloy can be modeled by non - stoichiometric nitride @xmath3-fe@xmath1n@xmath5 .",
    "there are a lot of experimental data about atomic and electronic structure of fe@xmath1n .",
    "we believe that mssbauer spectroscopy gives most interesting information about impurity distribution , electronic structure and magnetic interactions in alloys .",
    "studying of hyperfine structure of the energy spectra of nuclei is a powerful tool for investigation of interactions of atomic nucleus with local electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these interactions cause shifts and splittings of nuclear energy levels and enable us to obtain information about symmetry of charge distribution around the nucleus , about electronic configurations of atoms and ions , as well as about peculiarities of atomic structure of solids .",
    "a number of experimental papers show substantial differences in mssbauer spectra of binary fe - n and fe - c alloys .",
    "these differences are believed to be connected with different c and n distribution in fe fcc alloys @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present calculation results of hyperfine interaction parameters for iron nitride fe@xmath1n as well as for hypothetical fe@xmath1n structure with another distribution of nitrogen atoms .",
    "this allows us to determine changes in mssbauer spectra caused by redistribution on nitrogen atoms .",
    "wien97 programme package @xcite , employing full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method was used for calculations . as far as flapw",
    "is an all - electron method ( unlike pseudopotential methods ) , it allows to perform calculations of hyperfine interaction parameters from first principles .",
    "obtained theoretical parameters of interaction of a nucleus with electric and magnetic fields can be successfully compared with parameters of experimental mssbauer spectra .",
    "generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) according to perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite model was used for exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the radii of atomic spheres were chosen as 1.9 a.u .",
    "and 1.68 a.u for fe and n atoms respectively .",
    "the accuracy of calculation results depends on several basic parameters : number of @xmath6-points in brillouin zone , number of @xmath7-components and fourier coefficients in charge density and potential decomposition and number of plane waves in interstitial region .",
    "the choice of the values of these parameters was based on convergence condition .",
    "convergence tests gave the value @xmath8 , which corresponds to 205 plane waves per atom in the basis set .",
    "inside atomic spheres the wave function was decomposed up to @xmath9 .",
    "charge density and potential was decomposed inside atomic spheres using lattice harmonics basis up to @xmath10 . in the interstitial region",
    "fourier expansion was used with 850 coefficients .",
    "calculations were performed for 3000 k - points in the brillouin zone ( 84 k - points in the irreducible part ) .",
    "the values of all parameters ensure accuracy of 0.1 mry in total energy of the system . due to ferromagnetic nature of iron",
    "nitride all calculations were performed using spin - polarized approximation .",
    "the unit cell of iron nitride fe@xmath0n is a unit cell of @xmath3-fe with a nitrogen atom introduced in the centre of the cube ( figure [ cell]a ) .",
    "the structure has two symmetry types of fe atoms : fe@xmath11 type forms octahedron around impurity atom and has two impurity atoms in the first coordination sphere located at @xmath12 ; fe@xmath13 type is located in the corners of the cell and has no impurity atoms in the first coordination sphere .    in order to find the value of lattice parameter , corresponding to the minimum total energy of the system we performed calculations for five different values of lattice parameter .",
    "the results were approximated by second - order polynomial using least square fit method .",
    "then the value of lattice parameter was obtained analytically . calculated value of lattice parameter c=7.164 a.u .",
    "is in good agreement with experimental value c=7.17 a.u .",
    "calculations of electronic structure and hyperfine interaction parameters were performed using obtained optimized value of lattice parameter .",
    "optimization procedure was also performed for another two systems : @xmath3-fe ( fe - fcc ) and hypothetical fe@xmath0n structure ( figure [ cell]b ) .",
    "both calculations were also performed in spin - polarized approximation .",
    "calculation of @xmath3-fe seems interesting because it allows us to determine the influence of introducing of nitrogen atom on electronic structure and hyperfine interaction parameters of fe - fcc .",
    "optimization of hypothetical fe@xmath0n structure ( figure [ cell]b ) was performed including variation of interatomic fe - n distance .",
    "this structure has two types of iron atoms : fe@xmath14 and fe@xmath11 , having one and two n atoms in the nearest neighbourhood respectively .",
    "we found out that with this type of ordering the total energy of the structure is 18 mry larger , than the total energy of iron nitride .",
    "this shows that the formation of fe",
    "- n - fe - n chains ( fe@xmath11 configuration ) without fe - n pairs ( fe@xmath14 configuration ) is energetically favourable .    from the point of view of atomic structure of fe - n alloys",
    "iron nitride fe@xmath1n is the simplest structure where fe - n chains are combined with fe - fe chains .",
    "this makes possible to perform detailed analysis of the influence of nitrogen on electronic structure and hyperfine interaction parameters and to use obtained information later for analyzing more complicated fe - n alloys .",
    "this step - by - step approach , based on application of up - to - date _ ab initio _ calculation method , appears to be most accurate for solving the problem of the influence of impurity atoms on the properties of fe - based alloys .    * .",

    "< , < \" , ]     first of all let us analyze the electric field gradient , caused by the whole valent band ( valence efg ) .",
    "table [ tab3 ] shows that @xmath15 contribution is negligibly small for all energy regions .",
    "efg is practically formed by @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributions , which have different signs .",
    "we see that negative @xmath16 contribution is dominating , although it is greatly canceled by positive @xmath17 contribution .",
    "the analysis of table [ tab3 ] data allows us to conclude that main contribution to efg formation is made by @xmath18 and @xmath19 nitrogen states , and contribution from @xmath18 states is dominant .",
    "it should be noted that we are now talking about electrons , which have energy of nitrogen @xmath18 states , but spatially are located in fe@xmath11 sphere .",
    "substantial asymmetry of spatial distribution of these electrons ( figure [ den1]a ) gives main negative contribution to total efg .",
    "the interesting fact is that more than 70% of charge , formed by these electrons , have @xmath20symmetry , and 30% - @xmath21symmetry relative to the centre of fe@xmath11 sphere .",
    "this follows from analysis of @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributions for n-@xmath18 interval ( table [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the same situation is observed for @xmath22electrons of nitrogen , but their total efg contribution is 2.5 times smaller than @xmath23electrons contribution .",
    "the efg contribution of n-@xmath22electrons is practically caused only by electrons of @xmath20symmetry relative to the centre of fe@xmath11 sphere .",
    "substantial negative efg , caused by described asymmetry of nitrogen electrons , is greatly canceled by positive gradient , caused by own fe electrons ( figure [ den1]b ) .",
    "these are first of all fe-@xmath24electrons , which density is distributed in such a way , that greatly cancels asymmetry of @xmath19 and @xmath18 electrons of nitrogen .",
    "comparative analysis of @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributions shows that more than 60% of asymmetrically distributed electrons of fe-@xmath25 energy region have @xmath21symmetry , and less than 40% - @xmath20symmetry ( table [ tab3 ] ) relative to the centre of fe@xmath11 sphere .",
    "redistribution of rather localized fe-@xmath26 states also gives positive efg contribution , but this contribution is almost 5 times smaller than contribution of @xmath24states .    it should be noted that quadrupole splitting was calculated using total efg value , given in table [ tab2 ] , and for calculation of valence efg contribution summation in ( [ rho ] ) was done up to @xmath9 . on the other hand , for analysis of partial efg contributions we limited the summation only up to @xmath27 ( due to the absence of `` chemical '' @xmath28-states )",
    "this is the reason for small differences of valence efg values in tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] .",
    "the values of local magnetic moments play an important role in efg formation in iron nitride fe@xmath1n .",
    "the calculations show that the upper edge of fe-@xmath25 spin down states is located 2 ev above the fermi level .",
    "substantial difference in population of states with different spin orientation greatly influence efg formation .",
    "table [ tab3 ] gives efg contributions from states with different spin orientation for n-@xmath18 and fe-@xmath25 energy regions .",
    "we notice considerable difference in efg values , caused by spin up and down electrons of fe-@xmath25 interval .",
    "this effect mostly influence the value of @xmath17 contribution of this energy region .",
    "this contribution is mainly formed by density distribution of own @xmath24electrons of iron .",
    "spin up contribution is more than 3 times larger than spin down contribution for @xmath17 component of fe-@xmath24region .",
    "the fact that spin down states are partially `` pulled '' above the fermi level considerably decreases compensating positive component , and leads to increasing of absolute value of total ( negative ) efg . in the absence of this effect",
    "we would have considerably larger compensating component , which would lead to decreasing of total efg value and , as a consequence , to decreasing of quadrupole splitting in mssbauer spectra .",
    "we performed _ ab initio _ band structure calculations of iron nitride fe@xmath0n .",
    "all our results are in very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "structure characteristics as well as magnetic properties are well reproduced .",
    "we also performed calculations of hypothetical fe@xmath0n disordered structure .",
    "comparative analysis of these two calculations showed that the formation of fe - n pairs in fe@xmath0n compound is energetically unfavourable .",
    "we also calculated hyperfine interaction parameters for both fe@xmath0n structures taking into account the presence of magnetic field . for iron nitride structure we obtained perfect agreement of quadrupole splitting values with experimental data .",
    "for disordered fe@xmath0n structure we observe considerable decreasing of quadrupole splitting for fe - n - fe - n chains , and very small quadrupole splitting for fe - n pairs .",
    "detailed analysis of efg formation in iron nitride fe@xmath0n allows us to conclude that efg is mainly formed by space distribution of nitrogen @xmath19 and @xmath18 electrons , although it is greatly canceled by fe@xmath24electrons .",
    "magnetization reduces this cancellation effect and increases the value of total efg in iron nitride structure .",
