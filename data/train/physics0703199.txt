    "total absorption shower counters made of lead tungstate ( @xmath1 or pwo ) scintillation crystals are very promising for development of high quality electromagnetic calorimeters@xcite .",
    "they have already been used in the primex experiment at jlab and manifested a brilliant @xmath2-mass resolution ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the cms electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 62,000 pwo crystals in the barrel part and 15,000 in the endcap part is due to start operation at lhc soon @xcite .",
    "both the calorimeters work at room temperature .",
    "alice , another calorimeter at lhc , will be the first pwo - based calorimeter in the world operating at a temperature decreased down to -25  @xmath0c .",
    "an increase of the light yield by a factor of 3 in comparison with operation at room temperature ( + 20  @xmath0c ) is expected  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the noise of the calorimeter electronics will be reduced .",
    "both these effects will improve the energy resolution of the calorimeter .",
    "the same operation temperature of -25  @xmath0c is selected also for 20,000 pwo crystals in the panda calorimeter , a new experiment in the fair project at gsi , germany  @xcite .",
    "radiation hardness is another important issue in application of pwo scintillators in high energy physics experiments .",
    "it is well known that crystal scintillators suffer from radiation damage .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied over the last seven years at cms  @xcite and btev , the fermilab experiment which was terminated in 2005  @xcite . however ,",
    "all the studies of pwo radiation hardness have been carried out only at room temperature .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the first investigation of pwo crystal radiation hardness at temperatures below 0  @xmath0c .",
    "the temperature was varied in the range from + 20  @xmath0c down to -25  @xmath0c .",
    "the study was carried out for two different radiation loads of 20 and 2  rad / h ( radiation loads for the panda endcap electromagnetic calorimeter are estimated to be up to 2 - 3  rad / h ) .    .pwo",
    "crystal specifications data before irradiation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we also observed striking differences in recovery of the initial optical transmittance at the room and low temperatures .",
    "almost no recovery is observed at -25  @xmath0c ( see the first time period indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : recovery ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , when the temperature is fixed at + 20  @xmath0c , we can see a noticeable growth of the crystal transmittance ( the second time period in fig .",
    "[ fig : recovery ] ) .",
    "the results of irradiation over 80 hours of the ten crystals at 2 and 20 rad / h dose rate for the two temperatures , + 20  @xmath0c and -20  @xmath0c , are collected in the table  [ tab : summary2 ] .",
    "we have not seen any significant difference in radiation hardness of the ten crystals dependent on the doped element ( see tables [ tab : summary ] and [ tab : summary2 ] ) neither on the manufacturer . though we might notice that crystal a15608 is the most radiation hard .",
    "it is most probable that the increase of light output at low temperatures is caused by decreased loss of excitation via non - radiative recombination .",
    "meanwhile , the lower radiation hardness and suppressed recovery after irradiation , which were observed at low temperatures , are of considerable importance in application of pwo scintillation crystals as scintillators in cooled detectors .",
    "as it is generally accepted , the changes of light output of pwo crystals subjected to irradiation are caused not by any variations in emission efficiency but rather by radiation - induced absorption .",
    "peculiarities of these features of radiation hardness will be studied in more detail in further publications .",
    "there are currently two approaches explaining the optical properties of pwo crystal under irradiation  @xcite .    according to one approach  @xcite",
    ", transmission damage occurs in crystal when valence electrons are trapped in metastable states around the crystal defects .",
    "the irradiation of the crystals creates color centers which absorb light in particular spectral regions and cause reabsorption of the pwo emission .",
    "when the rate of color centers production ( proportional to the irradiation dose rate ) equals the natural temperature - dependent recovery rate , the crystal light output reaches a saturation level ( quasi - plateau ) .",
    "thus , the temperature dependent features of irradiation - induced absorption and recovery of the initial transmittance after termination of the irradiation can be interpreted by the shift of the balance between production and recovery of the color centers .    according to another approach  @xcite , the results presented above are in agreement with interpretation of radiation - induced changes in light output by structural changes in inclusions of variable - valency tungstate oxides @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "since tungsten has variable valency , irradiation invokes changes in tungsten valency , rearrangement of oxygen ions in the clusters @xmath4 , and , consequently , in change of absorption by these clusters .",
    "the irradiation - induced changes in the structure of @xmath4 clusters proceed slower at decreased temperatures , and the thermal energy is insufficient to facilitate the rearrangement of the initial cluster structure , which is necessary for recovery of initial optical transmittance .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study of radiation hardness of pwo scintillation crystals at temperatures decreased below the room temperature . using a selection of 10 similar commercial pwo crystals produced by different manufactures",
    "we demonstrate that the radiation - induced decrease of light output proceeds slower at lower temperatures and the initial output does not recover after termination of irradiation when the crystal temperature is maintained at -25  @xmath0c . nevertheless , the constant value of light output , which is reached after certain time under crystal irradiation at -25  @xmath0c , is still considerable higher than that at the room temperature .",
    "thus , cooling of pwo detectors is beneficial , though the long time evolution of the light output of the crystal under irradiation at decreased temperature ( of the order of hundreds hours ) should be taken into account in application of these detectors .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the intas grant n2 06 - 10000012 - 8845 .",
    "we would like to thank the management of ihep radiation research department for providing us a @xmath5 radioactive source for our gamma irradiation studies .",
