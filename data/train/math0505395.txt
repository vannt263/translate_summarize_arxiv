    "the development of the classification theory of topological @xmath0-manifolds in the simply - connected case @xcite,@xcite relied on the surgery program and parallelled the situation in higher dimensions .",

    "surgery and another ingredient of the classification theory  the s - cobordism conjecture  are reduced to closely related statements about immersions of disks .",
    "( the embedding problem related to surgery allows certain flexibility in the ambient manifold , so it is conceivable that the surgery conjecture holds while the s - cobordism conjecture has an obstruction . )",
    "more recent progress in the subject ( cf @xcite , @xcite ) , extending the class of fundamental groups for which such techniques hold , involved the analysis of maps of certain @xmath2-complexes , _ capped gropes _ , into @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "such methods so far have fallen short of proving the conjectures in general  the case of free groups is the key question .",
    "the study of surfaces in @xmath0-manifolds has been central to the subject , and the purpose of this survey is to mention open questions and available techniques . in particular",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the main open question may be formulated in terms of the existence of a _ smooth _ immersion , satisfying a certain condition on @xmath5 , of a disk into a specific smooth @xmath0-manifold .",

    ", certain special @xmath2-complexes embedded in @xmath0-manifolds , turned out to be a useful geometric tool for studying homotopies of surfaces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can easily find a capped grope in the context of the disk embedding theorem .",
    "if one finds a @xmath5-_null _ caped grope then the problem is solved using the foundational theorem @xcite that a casson handle is homeomorphic to the standard @xmath2-handle .",
    "we summarize the tools available for manipulating capped gropes in section [ definitions ] .",
    "on the one hand , these techniques allow one to encode the geometric problem in terms of algebra of trees in @xmath6 ( and lead to a solution when the fundamental group has subexponential growth . ) on the other hand , this does not immediately lead to an obstruction in the main open case ( free fundamental group ) since the moves on capped gropes , translating the problem into algebra , capture only a limited class of homotopies of surfaces .",
    "gropes have recently emerged also as an important tool in a different context : the study of the classical knot concordance group @xcite . in both applications gropes provide a filtration from bounding a surface ( algebraically : being trivial in homology ) to bounding a disk ( being trivial in @xmath5 ) .",
    "however they appear in different guises ( capped vs uncapped ) and therefore the techniques for studying them are quite different",
    ". moreover they serve distinct goals : in knot theory obstructions measure whether a knot bounds an embedded grope of a given height . in the surgery context",
    ", one can find a grope of any given height and the problem is to find a disk .",
    "therefore the question relevant for classification theory of @xmath0-manifolds is whether the intersection of the grope filtration on links coincides with the class of slice links .",

    "we choose a `` distinguished '' curve @xmath161 whose neighborhood is the solid torus specified above .          for a codimension @xmath26 submanifold @xmath29 of @xmath9 let @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "we say that @xmath171 is a _ decomposition _ of @xmath9 if @xmath79 are codimension zero submanifolds , and @xmath172 is the standard genus one heegaard decomposition of @xmath109 ( of course @xmath173 . )",
    "note that @xmath53 is an invariant of a submanifold and does not depend on an embedding @xmath176 .",
    "one can require an invariant to be defined on the class of all pairs ( @xmath0-manifold @xmath24 , distinguished circle in @xmath177 ) but only submanifolds of @xmath9 are relevant for the surgery conjecture .",
    "there is an elementary example of such an invariant ( in any dimension ) given by homology : define @xmath178 or @xmath41 depending on whether @xmath179 or @xmath180 respectively in @xmath181 ( with any fixed coefficients ) .",
    "axioms 1 and 2 are satisfied automatically and axiom 3 follows from alexander duality .    are there any other invariants ?",

    "an invariant of decompositions satisfying axioms 1 - 4 would be a very good candidate for an obstruction to surgery : the connection is made by considering fundamental domains of a hypothetical action of the free group on @xmath9 , discussed above . a new approach to constructing an invariant of decompositions",

    "that paper defines an invariant of @xmath0-manifolds using the notion of link - homotopy ; in a certain sense it is designed to satisfy axiom 4 .",
