    "many natural and man - made systems , ranging from the nervous system to power and transportation grids and the internet , exhibit dynamic behaviors that evolve over a sparse and complex interconnection structure . the ability to control network dynamics is not only a theoretically challenging problem but , more importantly , a barrier to fundamental breakthroughs across engineering , social sciences , and neuroscience .",
    "while multiple studies have addressed various aspects of this problem , several fundamental questions remain unanswered , including to what extent the capability of actuating a different set of nodes over time can improve controllability of large - scale , time - varying network systems .    in this paper",
    "we study controllability of networks with fixed topology and weights where , however , the set of control nodes can be selected over time .",
    "intuitively , the ability to actuate different nodes at different times allows for targeted interventions at different network locations , and can ultimately decrease the control effort to accomplish a desired task .",
    "yet , from a practical standpoint , the implementation of time - varying control schemes requires the ability to geographically relocate actuators or the presence of actuation mechanisms at different , possibly all , network nodes , and more sophisticated control policies . to justify the additional implementation costs and control complexity , we seek to characterize network topologies and dynamics that benefit from time - varying actuator schedules , and quantify the associated control improvement .",
    "we consider time - varying control policies where a small subset of available actuators is used at any given time .",
    "while this may seem at odds with the objective of reducing the overall control effort , this scenario is relevant when , for instance , ( i ) actuators exhibit nonlinear dead - zone behaviors , so that each one requires a sizable activation energy , ( ii ) actuators are controlled via communication channels with limited capacity , so that only a small number of devices can be simultaneously operated , ( iii ) actuators are geographically disperse so that precise coordination becomes difficult or time - consuming , and ( iv ) simultaneous actuation of proximal nodes results in actuator interference .",
    "examples include suppression of cascading failures in power networks , tracking in wireless sensor / actuator networks , and correction of neural disorders via external stimulation .    * literature review . * complex networks have long been the subject of active research , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "our work builds on the growing literature on controllability of linear complex networks , which seeks to address two fundamental questions : how network controllability relates to macroscopic properties such as size and degree distribution  @xcite , and how to choose an optimal set of control nodes to maximize certain controllability measures  @xcite . in addressing these questions ,",
    "a number of works employ binary controllability measures , i.e. , measures that only determine whether a system is fully controllable or not . the work  @xcite uses structural controllability to formulate a graph - based approach to identify the minimum number of leader nodes required for network controllability , and conjectures that this number is determined by network degree distribution .",
    "instead ,  @xcite emphasizes the role played by nodal dynamics in determining this minimum number .",
    "the work  @xcite proposes a heuristic greedy approach to approximate the np - hard problem of finding the smallest set of nodes to ensure network controllability .",
    "the fact that binary controllability measures are oblivious to the energy cost of steering the network state has motivated the introduction of several controllability metrics to quantify the required control effort , including the smallest eigenvalue , determinant , and trace of the controllability gramian  @xcite",
    ". the work  @xcite studies the scaling laws between the control horizon and network controllability , measured by the best and worst - case energy needed to steer the network state in all directions .",
    "the works  @xcite analyze the problem of finding the smallest set of control nodes that maximize average network controllability ( using the metric of the trace of the gramian and trace of gramian inverse , resp . ) , while  @xcite analyzes how the worst - case controllability scales with network size . with the exception of  @xcite , that proposes methods to select different control nodes over time to maximize worst - case controllability , the literature above relies on the implicit assumption that the set of control nodes is fixed over time .",
    "depending on the specific network structure , this assumption may come at the expense of a significant limitation on its controllability , especially for large - scale systems .",
    "time - varying scheduling is also employed in the design of ( sub)optimal actuator / sensor scheduling algorithms  @xcite , where periodic schedules can approximate the optimal performance arbitrarily well . yet ,",
    "little is known about the network properties that make time - varying schedules beneficial , which is our focus here .",
    "* statement of contributions .",
    "* we consider networks described by discrete - time linear state - space models over a time - invariant undirected graph .",
    "we employ the trace of the controllability gramian , which is a measure of average network controllability .",
    "the contributions of the paper are threefold .",
    "first , we introduce a novel notion of nodal communicability , termed @xmath1-communicability , characterize its properties , and show how it naturally arises in time - varying actuator scheduling : the optimal schedule consists of actuating , at each time index , the set of nodes with the highest communicability . based on this connection ,",
    "we show that the optimal schedule consists of only a finite number of switches in the set of actuation nodes irrespective of the time horizon ( in contrast , for instance , to the universal approximation property of periodic schedules in optimal sensor scheduling ) .",
    "second , we provide three conditions on the network topology that guarantee optimality of time - invariant actuator schedules , and we identify networks that satisfy these conditions including uniform line , ring , and star networks without self - loops and barabsi - albert scale - free random networks ( with high probability ) .",
    "our analysis reveals that time - invariant actuator schedules are optimal when the network has a single authority , that is , a single node with distinctly higher influence on the dynamics .",
    "third , we characterize the class of networks for which the optimal actuator schedule is time - varying .",
    "in addition to a main sufficient condition based on @xmath0-communicability , we show that this class includes networks with small but `` powerful '' ( in terms of local edge weights ) subnetworks , as well as watts - strogatz small - world networks ( with high probability ) .",
    "erds - rnyi random networks , instead , do not require a time - varying actuator schedule due to the lack of leader heterogeneity , except when they are moderate - sized and sparse ( with high probability ) . finally , we examine the sub - optimality gap of time - invariant actuator schedules for star , watts - strogatz , and erds - rnyi networks .",
    "for ease of exposition , we state our results for single - input networks and discuss the generalization to multiple - input networks in various remarks along the paper .",
    "here , we introduce notational conventions and review basic concepts on graph theory and network centrality .",

    "one can show  @xcite that in the extreme cases of @xmath89 for the exponential and @xmath90 in the resolvent case , both notions result in the same rankings of nodes as eigenvector centrality .",

    "we consider a network of @xmath11 nodes that communicate , in discrete time , over a weighted undirected graph @xmath60 with adjacency matrix @xmath22 .",

    "the overall network dynamics are @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the state of node @xmath18 for @xmath76 , @xmath93 is the control input , and @xmath94 is the time - varying input vector , all at time  @xmath69 . since we can always normalize @xmath95 and include its magnitude in @xmath96 , we assume @xmath97 so that @xmath98 . given a time horizon @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the set of time - varying input selections over the time horizon  @xmath101 .",
    "controllability of at time @xmath99 is defined as the possibility of steering the network from any initial state @xmath102 to any desired state @xmath103 using the input @xmath104 .",

    "it is also well - known  @xcite that when @xmath105 , among all the controls @xmath104 that can steer the network from the origin to an arbitrary @xmath107 at time @xmath101 , the one with minimum energy @xmath30 is given by @xmath108 it is immediate to verify that @xmath109 .",
    "it is thus desirable to have @xmath110 as `` large '' as possible . to quantify how large the gramian is",
    ", several spectral measures have been proposed in the literature  @xcite , including @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "while each metric has its own benefits and limitations , we focus here on the trace of the gramian due to its significance and analytical tractability .",
    "this metric is inversely related to the average energy required to steer the network in all directions in the state space , thus approximating the network average controllability . given this metric of network controllability",
    ", we are interested in the solution of the following optimization problem : @xmath116 using the definition   and the invariance property of trace under cyclic permutations , we can write @xmath117 note that @xmath118 is the @xmath119-th diagonal entry of @xmath120 , where @xmath119 is the index of the node to which @xmath121 is applied , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the optimization   at each time @xmath123 boils down to finding the largest diagonal element of  @xmath120 .",
    "the computation of the exact solution to   is feasible ( with polynomial time complexity ) for large networks since the optimization in   is completely decoupled over time .",
    "this is because the trace of the gramian is a modular function over the set  @xmath124 .",

    "our problem of interest is then to determine under what conditions , for which networks , and by how much an optimal time - varying actuator schedule outperforms an optimal time - invariant one .",
    "[ rem : mi ] our exposition above considers the case of a single input applied to the network at each time  @xmath69 . in the ensuing discussion",
    ", we also provide extensions of our results for the general case where @xmath128 inputs are selected at each time . for time - varying actuator scheduling to be beneficial for a network with @xmath129 inputs , any of the first @xmath129 largest of @xmath130 can change over time , which is only implied by ( but does not imply ) a change in @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the results of the single - input case can not be readily transcribed to the @xmath129-input case , and some care is required to generalize them .",
    "here , we introduce the notion of @xmath0-communicability and explain its connection with the optimal actuator scheduling problem of section  [ sec : prob - state ] .",
    "we also discuss its similarities and differences with the existing notions of communicability as well as its limiting scenarios ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) . from the discussion of section  [ sec : prob - state ] , the optimal input selection in  is @xmath134 for all @xmath135 . for each @xmath136 , @xmath137 is a convex sum of @xmath11 exponential functions of the variable  @xmath69 .",
    "precisely , let @xmath138 be the eigen - decomposition of @xmath22 , where @xmath139_{n \\times n}$ ] is orthogonal and @xmath140 , with @xmath141 . for convenience ,",

    "thus , all we need to know is the number of times that the maximizer of these @xmath11 sums of @xmath11 exponentials changes over @xmath150 .",
    "if the maximizer is constant , a time - varying input allocation is not beneficial and vice versa .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we introduce the following definition .    [ def:2k - comm ] consider a dynamic network of @xmath11 nodes defined by the adjacency matrix @xmath22 .",
    "for any @xmath151 , the _ @xmath152-communicability _ of each node @xmath136 is @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath1-communicability of a node  @xmath18 counts the ( weighted ) number of cycles of length @xmath1 that pass through node  @xmath18 ( unlike the exponential and resolvent communicabilities described in section  [ sec : prelims ] that count a weighted number of the total number of cycles _ of all lengths _ that pass through each node ) .",
    "the advantage of this notion is its direct connection with optimal actuator scheduling in discrete - time networks ( c.f .  , the same role that is played by exponential communicability in continuous - time networks ( with @xmath88 playing the `` time '' role of @xmath69 )",
    "also , a different but related notion of centrality , called `` average energy controllability centrality '' , is proposed in  @xcite in order to measure the average ability of any individual node to move the network in all directions in the state space .    to study the number of changes in @xmath154 , it is convenient to extend the domain of definition of @xmath155 to @xmath156 . for consistency , define @xmath157 for @xmath158 and @xmath136 .",
    "the following result , whose proof is straightforward , summarizes basic properties of this function .    for @xmath136 , @xmath159 is smooth and strictly convex , satisfies @xmath160 , and is monotonically decreasing if @xmath161 .",

    "+    [ lem : swap - bd ] the maximum number of switches in @xmath166 over @xmath167 is @xmath168 , where @xmath11 is the network dimension .",
    "according to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 1 ) , an arbitrary sum of @xmath11 ( distinct ) exponential functions has at most @xmath169 zeros .",
    "therefore , any pair @xmath170 and @xmath171 can swap orders at most @xmath172 times ( given that @xmath160 for all @xmath136 ) . since there are @xmath173 such pairs , the total number of control node switches can not be more than @xmath174 , which is @xmath168 .",
    "lemma  [ lem : swap - bd ] rules out the possibility of arbitrarily large number of optimal control node switches . as figure",
    "[ fig : many - swaps ] and examples  [ ex : ba ] and  [ ex : er - ws ] later show , even the bound @xmath168 is quite conservative .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that the number of switches in @xmath165 over @xmath175 is at most @xmath169 .",
    "the rationale for this conjecture is twofold .",
    "first , since @xmath176 are convex combinations of the same @xmath11 functions @xmath177 and these functions decay exponentially fast with respect to each other , the ( at most @xmath172 ) positive roots of any difference of the form @xmath178 occur roughly at the times @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the ( first ) time such that @xmath181 .",
    "thus , we expect to have at most one switch close to each @xmath180 , giving a total of @xmath169 .",
    "second , our extensive simulations over various network architectures never yielded more than @xmath169 switches in @xmath165 , supporting our conjecture .",
    "lemma  [ lem : swap - bd ] also highlights how the optimal actuator schedule is determined by the dependence of the nodes @xmath1-communicabilities on the time index  @xmath69 . for small @xmath69 ,",
    "this notion depends on the local network structure , and incorporates more global information as @xmath69 grows .",
    "in particular ,    1 .   the @xmath182-communicability of a node is closely related to its ( weighted ) degree centrality . to see this , note that @xmath183 , so @xmath184 is equal to the degree in unweighted networks . in the case of weighted networks ,",
    "the @xmath182-communicability and degree centrality become more different as the network weights become more heterogeneous ( see e.g. , figure  [ fig : many - swaps ] , where the vector of degree centralities is @xmath185 ) .",
    "the @xmath186-communicability of a node , i.e. , @xmath187 as @xmath133 , results in the same ordering of the nodes as the eigenvector centrality ( assuming that @xmath188 ) . if @xmath189 , this immediately follows from @xmath190 , with @xmath191 being the vector of centralities .",
    "if @xmath192 , one can normalize @xmath22 by @xmath193 and then take the limit @xmath194 ( which does not affect the order of the nodes ) .",
    "the extension of our results to normal networks ( i.e. , directed networks with a normal adjacency matrix ) is straightforward . in this case , using @xmath195 , we have @xmath196 where @xmath197 and the unitary matrix @xmath48 contain the singular values and singular vectors of @xmath22 , resp . defining @xmath198_{n \\times n}$ ] and @xmath199^t$ ]",

    "examples are star networks with no ( or small - weight ) self - loops , as we show in example  [ ex : line - ring - star ] .",
    "3 .   regarding condition  _ ( iii ) _ , the most well - known families of networks with three distinct eigenvalues are the complete bipartite networks and connected strongly regular networks .",
    "moreover , cones on @xmath236-strongly regular graphs satisfying @xmath237 are also known to have three distinct eigenvalues  @xcite . the other condition @xmath209 holds when the node with the largest eigenvector centrality has also the largest @xmath182-communicability ( c.f . the correlation between @xmath182-communicability and degree in section  [ sec:2k - comm ] ) .",
