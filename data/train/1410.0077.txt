    "the fate of a single particle tunnelling in a many - body environment is a subject of fundamental interest not least because of its connection to the decoherence problem in quantum mechanics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study a related system consisting of a single impurity atom tunnelling between the wells of a double well potential in the presence of @xmath0 indistinguishable bosonic atoms as illustrated schematically in figure [ fig : doublewell ] .",
    "the bosons are also trapped in the double well potential and thus form a bosonic josephson junction in their own right .",
    "this setup can be considered to be an elementary example of a bose - fermi mixture although , because the statistics of the impurity do not matter , in practice it can be a boson of the same species but in a different internal state . the prospects for realizing such a system in the laboratory",
    "are reasonably promising : a large number of experiments have studied ultracold bosons trapped in external double well potentials @xcite , and others have realized the same effective system in a single trap but where two internal states of the atoms are coupled by microwave / radio frequency fields ( internal josephson effect ) @xcite . adding a well defined number of impurities is not easy but there has been some progress in this direction in optical lattices @xcite",
    ".     identical bosons ( represented by the small blue dots ) which are able to tunnel between the two sides of a double well potential . to this",
    "is added a single impurity atom ( large red dot ) which is also able to tunnel between the two wells . ]",
    "a theoretical analysis of a bosonic josephson junction with an impurity has been given by rinck and bruder @xcite , who found that by applying a tilt to the double well a multi - particle tunnelling resonance could be induced towards a state where the impurity was expelled to the higher lying well .",
    "subsequently , we undertook a study comparing the mean - field and many - body properties and described the appearance of a pitchfork bifurcation in the ground state of the mean - field theory above a certain critical value @xmath2 of the boson - impurity interaction strength @xcite .",
    "the mean - field bifurcation arises from the spontaneous localization of the impurity in one of the wells together with a localization of a majority of bosons in the opposite well ( assuming repulsive interactions ) . in",
    "the fully quantum version @xmath2 marks the onset of a splitting of the wave function into two coherent pieces in fock space ( the space spanned by the fock states @xmath3 corresponding to the number differences @xmath4 and @xmath5 between the left and right wells for the impurity and bosons , respectively ) . as @xmath6 is increased further the fock space splitting increases , and for large @xmath0 can develop into a fully blown schrdinger cat state which is a superposition of two macroscopically distinguishable number differences of bosons .",
    "this state is associated with a saturation of the entanglement entropy between the impurity and the bosons at @xmath7 .",
    "the formation of a schrdinger cat state in a macroscopic measurement device as a result of its coupling to a microscopic system is usually considered to be an essential element of quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "one may therefore take the view that the bosons in the present system act as a quantum measurement device or meter which indicates the position of the microscopic impurity atom .",
    "this meter can be tuned between being microscopic ( small @xmath0 ) and macroscopic ( large @xmath0 ) .",
    "the formation and collapse of the schrdinger cat state corresponds here to a symmetry breaking phase transition @xcite .    in another study @xcite",
    ", we argued that in many respects the impurity system behaves like the celebrated dicke model @xcite for @xmath0 two - level atoms coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field whose hamiltonian takes the form @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 annihilate and create , respectively , a photon of energy @xmath11 in the electromagnetic field and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are collective spin operators that arise from treating the two - level atoms , whose levels are separated by energy @xmath14 , as pseudospins .",
    "@xmath13 measures half the difference between the number of atoms in the excited state and the ground state and it eigenvalues lie in the range @xmath15 . @xmath16 measures the coherence between the excited and ground states of the atoms and @xmath17 is proportional to the position operator for the harmonic oscillator associated with the electromagnetic field . in a related pseudospin formulation the hamiltonian for the bosonic josephson junction plus impurity can be written ( see section [ sec : model ] for details ) @xmath18 where the superscript ` @xmath19 ' denotes the impurity : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the bare hopping frequencies between the two wells for the bosons and impurity , respectively , and @xmath6 parameterizes the boson - impurity coupling strength . in this form",
    "the impurity model is reminiscent of the mermin central - spin model where a distinguishable central - spin is surrounded by @xmath0 spins on a lattice which interact with the central spin with an effectively infinite range interaction so that all pairwise interactions have the same magnitude @xcite . in the impurity model",
    "@xmath13 measures the coherence of the bosons between the two wells , or , equivalently , half the difference in the number of bosons in the antisymmetric and symmetric modes formed , respectively , from the odd and even combinations of the modes associated with each well .",
    "@xmath12 measures half the number difference between the two wells , or , equivalently , the coherence between their symmetric and antisymmetric combinations .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding quantities for the impurity . in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath24 , the ground state of the dicke model undergoes a second order phase transition due to a spontaneous breaking of @xmath25 symmetry at the critical coupling strength @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this phase transition ( pt ) bears a very close resemblance to the bifurcation that occurs in the impurity model at @xcite @xmath27 in the dicke case the ground state below the transition ( @xmath28 ) is known as the normal state and is characterized by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , whereas the ground state above the transition is known as the superradiant state because it corresponds to a spontaneous macroscopic excitation of the electromagnetic field with both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "analogous ground states occur for the impurity model : when @xmath33 both the boson and the impurity probability distributions are symmetric @xmath34 and @xmath35 and both expectation values acquire finite values in the symmetry broken state occurring when @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the ground state energy upon the scaled parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 is identical in the two models in the immediate vicinity of the transition @xcite .",
    "it is also notable that the mean - field dynamics is in both cases regular below the transition and chaotic above it @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall further investigate the bifurcation in the impurity model by calculating the critical exponents in order to establish whether it is indeed a second order phase transition in the same universality class as that in the dicke model .",
    "although both the dicke and impurity models share many common features there is one glaring difference : the dicke model couples @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles to a harmonic oscillator whereas the impurity model couples @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles to one other spin . in essence the impurity model truncates the harmonic oscillator hilbert space to just two states , the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "the spin-1/2 representing the impurity can never become macroscopically excited like the simple harmonic oscillator can .",
    "it is therefore quite remarkable that the impurity model behaves like the dicke model , but the critical exponents we calculate here show that very close to the transition a two - state hilbert space for the harmonic oscillator in the dicke model suffices to describe its critical properties .    in order to investigate the critical behavior and obtain the critical scaling exponents we shall calculate the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state . over the past decade",
    "the concept of fidelity , which originated in quantum information theory @xcite , has gained wide use in analyzing critical behavior and classifying the universality of systems .",
    "it is most commonly used to quantify changes in the ground state of a system over a pt .",
    "this is done by calculating the product between the ground state with itself at different points in parameter space @xmath39 where @xmath6 is the tunable parameter that drives the pt and @xmath40 is the ground state . it is expected that @xmath41 will tend to unity away from the critical region and reach a minimum when @xmath42 where the scalar product will be between the ground state below and above the critical point .",
    "one of the first phase transitions to be studied using the fidelity was the one - dimensional ( 1d ) xy model where it was shown to decrease to a minimum near the critical point @xcite .",
    "furthermore , excited state fidelity has been used to characterize quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) where the ground state fidelity has failed @xcite . since the fidelity is a quantity depending only on the geometry of the hilbert space and requires",
    "no knowledge of the order parameter it is useful in cases where the order parameter of a system is not obvious and has been studied in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "that being said , a more sensitive and natural quantity to study where no _ a priori _ knowledge of the system is needed , is the fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) @xcite .",
    "the fs measures the response of the fidelity to infinitesimal changes in the driving parameter of the system .",
    "it is closely related to the second derivative of the ground state energy with respect to the driving parameter , @xmath43 , so the fs is also similar to the magnetic susceptibility or specific heat when the driving parameters are the magnetic field and temperature , respectively .",
    "this means the fs can be used to study the critical behaviour of a system through calculations of scaling exponents .    in this paper",
    "we add to work done by others @xcite regarding the scaling and criticality of bosons in a double well potential .",
    "we follow standard steps @xcite to show that the fs can be used to calculate scaling exponents for a general system .",
    "we then use the fs to focus on the critical behaviour of the two - site boson - impurity hubbard model .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec [ sec : model ] we go into more detail about our model for the physical system under study . in sec [ sec : fs ] we show how critical scaling exponents can be extracted from the fs . in sec [",
    "sec : nr ] we apply the methods of sec [ sec : fs ] to our system as well as extrapolate data to find numerical values for @xmath44 . in sec [ sec : ar ] we find the fs critical exponents analytically and in sec [ sec : dc ] we give a summary and outlook for further work . some of the details of the analytic calculations have been placed in an appendix .",

    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the equivalent operators for the impurity .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath51 subscripts denote the left and right modes and the creation / annihilation operators follow the usual bosonic commutation relations , i.e.@xmath52=[\\hat{a}_\\alpha,\\hat{a}_\\alpha^\\dagger]=1 $ ] with @xmath53 and all other combinations of the boson and impurity operators are zero .",

    "we do not include direct boson - boson intra - well ( or inter - well ) interactions in our calculations and assume they can be removed ( or the boson - impurity interaction enhanced ) by a feshbach resonance if necessary .",
    "we do this both to highlight the effect of the impurity and also because it turns out not to change the results in a qualitative way . indeed , the nonlinearity due to the boson - boson interactions can lead to very similar results as those resulting from the boson - impurity interaction ( the impurity can be viewed as mediating an effective interaction between the bosons ) . in the case of repulsive boson - boson interactions , a purely bosonic system has no pt in the ground state but does experience a symmetry breaking bifurcation in the excited states known as macroscopic self - trapping @xcite which has been seen in experiments @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the boson - boson interactions are attractive then there is a @xmath25 symmetry breaking pt in the ground state above a critical interaction strength where the bosons clump together in a single well .",
    "this pt has been studied by buonsante _",
    "et al _ @xcite and we shall find that the pt in our system falls in the same universality class .    in previous work we found through stability analysis around the mean - field stationary points @xcite that a pitchfork bifurcation of @xmath59 occurs at a critical value of the boson - impurity interaction @xmath2 given above in eq .",

    "the fact that the maximum value of the fs , which can be viewed as a generalized susceptibility , diverges in the thermodynamic limit confirms that the symmetry breaking is associated with a second order phase transition ( as expected from the continuous form of the bifurcation ) . by numerically calculating the critical scaling exponents of the fs and comparing them with those already known in the dicke and lmg models , as well as for a system consisting of bosons in a double well potential with attractive interactions ,",

    "this collapse is implicit in our model but it is interesting to ask whether a third agent beyond the impurity and the bosons is necessary to precipitate it . if the symmetry is broken by a classical field then it can be simply included in the hamiltonian as a tilt to the double well potential @xcite and as long as the perturbation is infinitesimal the pt is not affected . however , if the boson - impurity system is instead put into contact with a quantum mechanical environment then the effects can be more marked .",
    "pts in open quantum systems ( systems coupled to an environment ) are now the subject of intensive research @xcite , especially for the open dicke model @xcite .",
    "one conclusion of this body of work is that the critical exponents can be modified by the coupling to the environment and this effect has been seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that the impurity localization described in this paper is somewhat different to that found in the classic problem of an impurity in a uniform superfluid @xcite , or its modern descendant , an impurity in an extended gaseous bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite . for example , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian employed here is a tight - binding model where the single particle wave functions ( modes ) are assumed to be unchanged by interactions , whereas the transition to a self - localized polaron state in an initially uniform bec involves a change in the impurity wave function from delocalized to localized and the bec develops a corresponding density dip .",
    "furthermore , the type of symmetry that is broken in going from a uniform to a localized wave function is in general different to the binary choice underlying @xmath25 symmetry breaking ( see reference @xcite for the case of a particle living on one and two - dimensional lattices with many lattice sites ) .",
