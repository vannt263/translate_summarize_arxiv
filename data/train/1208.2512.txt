    "the defining of the dynamic high frequency ( hf ) electrical conductivity of the strongly coupled plasma is an actual and very important problem because such characteristics of plasma as the hf dielectric function , the coefficients of refractivity and reflectivity , and skin depth are expressed just in terms of the dynamic electrical conductivity .",
    "however , until recently the determination of the dynamic plasma conductivity in the wide ranges of the electron densities @xmath6 and the temperatures @xmath7 was not taken as the priority task .",
    "namely , in the most cases the mentioned problem was not investigated as the main one @xcite , and only few authors presented the results of the direct definition of hf electrical conductivity @xcite related to some selected values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    because of that , a few years ago a certain research of the hf conductivity of the plasmas was started .",
    "it was thought that the previous researches of the transport properties of the dense strongly coupled plasmas free of any external fields @xcite , and the plasmas in the presence of the constant magnetic field @xcite , gave some results which were useful in the case of the plasma in the external time depending fields .",
    "from this reason the research of the hf plasma conductivity was also devoted to the dense strongly coupled plasmas .",
    "the main aim was to examine the hf conductivity in the whole area of such plasmas , including here the region of the extremely large degrees of its non - ideality .",
    "this was especially important , since the existing literature data about the hf plasma conductivity @xcite are just related to the extremely strongly coupled plasmas @xmath10 .",
    "the first results of that research were presented in @xcite , where the new method of the calculations of the strongly coupled plasma hf conductivity is described .",
    "this method was tested on the plasmas with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in the microwave and far - infrared regions of @xmath0 , were @xmath0 is the frequency of the external electric field .",
    "the developed method uses the energy - dependent electron collision frequency which is determined as a sum over the matsubara frequencies , using the green function theory methods and the corresponding self - consistent calculations procedure , which is described in details in @xcite .",
    "the final results , i.e. the hf conductivity @xmath13 , as well as its real and imaginary parts @xmath14 , were presented in the adequate , three - parameter drude - like form . as the second step , by @xcite the same method with its improved numerical procedure it was applied to the denser plasmas , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in infrared , visible and near uv regions of @xmath0 .    since , in @xcite the domain of low and moderately non - ideal plasmas was covered , the first aim of this letter was to apply the developed method by the adequate numerical procedure , in order to determine of the hf conductivities of the strongly and extremely coupled plasmas , i.e. for @xmath17 .",
    "this way would not only laboratory strongly coupled plasmas but also some astrophysical plasmas ( for examples , the photospheres of some white dwarfs @xcite ) be considered .",
    "another aim is to compare the obtained results with the existing theoretical results and computer simulation data @xcite , which refer to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "such a comparison is very important because there is no data concerning the direct experimental measurements of hf conductivity of the dense strongly coupled plasmas @xcite , @xcite .",
    "similarly to our previous papers @xcite , the hf conductivity @xmath20 , as well as @xmath21 , are presented here in the three - parameters drude - like form , where one of these parameters is the static conductivity @xmath22 of the considered plasma , which is suitable for further consideration . however , while in @xcite the values of @xmath22 could be taken from @xcite , the corresponding values for the region @xmath23 were especially calculated here .",
    "the calculations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in all considered cases , for all taken values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are performed here in the frequency range @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the plasma electron frequency .",
    "the results are compared with the data from @xcite .",
    "in this letter it is considered a completely ionized plasma in a homogenous and monochromatic external electric field @xmath28 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the dynamic electric conductivity of a strongly coupled plasma @xmath29 is presented by the expressions    @xmath30\\rho ( e)ede , \\label{sig_rpa}\\ ] ]    @xmath31 \\rho ( e)ede , \\label{eq::re}\\ ] ]    @xmath32 \\rho(e ) e de , \\label{eq::im } % \\label{eq::sig_rpa_im}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the charge , mass and energy of the free electron , @xmath36 - the relaxation time presented later in the text , @xmath37 - one - electron states density in the energy space , @xmath38^{-1}$ ] - the fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath39 - the chemical potential of the ideal gas of the free electrons with the density @xmath8 and the temperature @xmath9 , and @xmath40 .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ sig_rpa ] ) by @xmath41 with the expression for the static conductivity @xmath22 of the fully ionized strongly coupled plasma from @xcite , one can see that    @xmath42\\rho ( e)ede . \\label{eq::sig0}\\ ] ]    consequently , from eqs.([eq::re ] ) and ( [ eq::im ] ) it follows the validity of the relations @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which have the sense of the conditions in the point @xmath41 during the numerical calculations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the right side of eq.([eq::sig0 ] ) has the lorentz - like form .",
    "because of that the quantity @xmath45 was interpreted in @xcite as the corresponding electron relaxation time ( total electron - ion plus electron - electron ) , characterizing the considered plasma in the absence of the external fields . since the same quantity @xmath45 is used in the expressions ( [ sig_rpa]- [ eq::im ] ) for @xmath20 just the good understanding of the static conductivity @xmath22 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 has a very important role in defining the strongly coupled plasma dynamic conductivity . because of this fact our research was started in ( see @xcite ) in the region of the plasma electron density @xmath46 , where the basic method of the determination of the @xmath22 from @xcite was experimentally verified @xcite .    accordingly to @xcite , the relaxation time @xmath36 is defined in the self - consistent approximation by the following relations :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the label for the plasma species , @xmath49 - the species charge number , @xmath50 - corresponding polarization operator in the random - phase approximation ( a simple loop ) , @xmath51 - the dielectric function expressed in terms of these quantities , and the @xmath52 summation is extended over the matsubara even frequencies @xcite . here , the polarization operator @xmath53 of non - degenerate @xmath54-th ion component is equal to @xmath55 , and the rpa polarization operator @xmath56 of partially degenerate free electron component , namely    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the main numerical problems , which appear during the calculation of the static conductivity @xmath22 , are connected to the defining of the relaxation time @xmath62 .",
    "namely , the number of the members in the @xmath52 sum in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) , which has to be calculated individually , rapidly increases with the increase of the electron density @xmath8 .",
    "for example , at @xmath63 this number is order of magnitude @xmath64 , while each member itself has to be calculated by a special procedure .",
    "it is clear that the determination of the hf conductivity @xmath20 , requires the volume of the calculations several times larger than in the case of the determination of @xmath22 .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , the quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be presented in the parameterized form , suitable for the comparison with the corresponding drude - like formulas , namely    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq::sig0 ] ) , @xmath69 is the effective relaxation time defined by @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are parameters , which describe the influence of the deviation of the @xmath73 from the @xmath74-function @xcite .",
    "when the electron component of the considered plasma can be treated as a highly degenerate gas of the free electrons , both coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 tend to @xmath77 , and equation ( [ sig_par ] ) reduce to the drude - lorentz model @xcite . using the plasma frequency @xmath78 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 , defined by relations",
    "@xmath80 , the parameterized expressions for @xmath81 and @xmath82 convert into    @xmath83    our previous numerical analysis have shown that @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be cast in the following approximate fitting form    @xmath84    where the adjustment parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 are determined numerically from the condition of the best relation between the exact and fitted values of the factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "let us notify that by just using the expressions ( [ sig_par])-([sig_par_2 ] ) for @xmath24 and @xmath25 we get the possibility to confirm whether drude - like model ( when @xmath87 ) has the physical sense for the considered @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper it was defined the dynamic conductivity @xmath88 of completely ionized hydrogen - like plasmas , when in expression ( [ tau ] ) only two species ( electron and ion with @xmath89 ) are taken into account .",
    "here we had on mind that the using of the expressions ( [ sig_par ] ) and ( [ sig_par_2 ] ) for the determination of @xmath24 and @xmath25 require the knowledge of the static conductivity @xmath68 .",
    "from this reason the values of @xmath68 are especially determined here in the considered domain @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these values are presented in tables [ tab::sig0_rpa ] .",
    "then , according to @xcite and @xcite , the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eqs .",
    "( [ sig_par ] ) and ( [ sig_par_2 ] ) are taken in the form ( [ k1 k2 ] ) , where they are expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the values of these parameters were also computed in the same domain ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) and presented in table [ tab::k1 ] and table [ tab::k2 ] .    the conduct of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , calculated directly by eqs .",
    "( [ eq::re ] ) and ( [ eq::im ] ) for @xmath96 and @xmath100 , is displayed in tables and figures in the ranges @xmath101 .",
    "the figures [ fig::berk1a ] , [ fig::berk1c ] , [ fig::berk2a ] and [ fig::reinh ] , demonstrate the regular behavior of @xmath102 , i.e. the convergence to the corresponding values of @xmath103 when @xmath104 , and the existence of the interval of variation of @xmath105 where @xmath106 is practically constant .",
    "we observe the tendency of this interval to decrease when temperature @xmath9 increases .",
    "similarly , the figures [ fig::berk1b ] , [ fig::berk2b ] and [ fig::reinh ] , demonstrate a regular behavior of @xmath25 , i.e. the convergence to zero when @xmath107 , and the presence of a maximum in the interval @xmath108 .",
    "the obtained results , together with the data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , show that the position of this maximum comes to @xmath109 when @xmath8 grows in the region @xmath110 , and decrease from @xmath109 when @xmath8 increases in the region @xmath111 .",
    "we compare the behavior of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , determined in this letter , with the behavior of the corresponding quantities determined in : @xcite and @xcite , for @xmath114 and @xmath115 ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for @xmath114 and @xmath116 ; @xcite for @xmath117 and @xmath115 ; @xcite , for @xmath118 and @xmath119 . here",
    "@xmath120 and @xmath121 are the well - known non - ideality and brueckner parameters , where @xmath122 and @xmath123^{1/3}$ ] are the bohr and the wigner - seitz radii .",
    "the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were obtained by using the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation method , while the results of @xcite and @xcite are theoretical .",
    "the data from @xcite are obtained by two analytical expressions for the collision frequency ( the main one , obtained within the memory function formalism , and the approximate one found by the solution of the high - frequency hydrodynamic equation derived from the macroscopic equations of electron motion ) . the corresponding curves in the example",
    "@xmath114 and @xmath115 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig::berk1a ] and [ fig::berk1b ] , and in the case @xmath114 and @xmath116 - in figs .",
    "[ fig::berk2a ] and [ fig::berk2b ] .",
    "the figures [ fig::berk1a ] and [ fig::berk1b ] show that in the example @xmath114 and @xmath115 our values of @xmath24 and @xmath99 are mostly in good relation with the results obtained in @xcite by the md simulation method , except the region @xmath124 .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for the theoretical results obtained in @xcite for @xmath114 and @xmath115 by means of the mentioned approximate expression .",
    "connected to the theoretical results from @xcite and @xcite , obtained by means of the main analytical expression in the cases @xmath114 and @xmath117 , for the same @xmath115 , a good agreement with our results exists in the whole region of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it cold be expected since that main analytical expression has significant similarity with our expressions .    from figure [ fig::berk1b ] , concerning @xmath99",
    ", one can see that not only our results , but both results of @xcite significantly disagree with the results of the md simulation from @xcite in the region @xmath124 .",
    "we believe that final conclusions , respecting this fact , can be reached only after some additional md simulations , since in this region the behavior of of the static conductivity @xmath22 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 has the dominant role , and till now we have been considering our values of @xmath22 as fairly reliable .    in the example",
    "when @xmath114 and @xmath116 the figure [ fig::berk2a ] shows a good relation of our values of @xmath106 with the values obtained in @xcite and @xcite , since only in the region @xmath125 there exists some appreciable difference ( the largest differences are less that @xmath126 percents ) between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "the figure [ fig::berk2b ] , concerning @xmath113 , shows a qualitative agreement ( the differences are less or close to @xmath127 percents ) of our results with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this letter , together with the ones presented in @xcite and @xcite , make possible easy determination of @xmath112 and @xmath99 in very wide ranges of the electron density and temperature , namely @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "consequently , they can be used for the theoretical research , as well as for the interpretation of experimental data in the cases of high pressure discharge , capillary discharge , shock waves , etc . , where the strongly coupled plasmas , including extremely dense plasmas , are created .",
    "apart of that , @xmath112 and @xmath99 can be useful in some cases of stellar plasmas ( e.g. , white dwarfs ) .",
    "it is important that the presented results allow the determination of other optical characteristics of strongly coupled plasmas : the permeability , the refractivity , etc .",
    "the advantage of the method , which was used in our research until now , is that it does not contain any empirical parameters , and have got internal possibilities for its further improvement .",
    "let us emphasize that the used procedure is similar to the procedure for the determination of the conductivity tensor in the case of a strongly coupled plasma in an external static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this fact opens the possibility for the development of the method of determination of the conductivity of strongly coupled plasmas in an external high frequency electromagnetic field in the presence of the static ( or quasi - static ) external magnetic field .",
    "finally , the method used in this letter does not assume in advance the quasi - drude shape for @xmath20 , but the way of presentation of the final expressions for @xmath130 and @xmath131 automatically demonstrates the character of the deviations from drude s expression , at least in the case we consider .    certainly , since the numerical procedure for the determination of @xmath112 and @xmath99 which is used here is quite complicated , it is desirable to develop some other methods which would allow an easier calculation of these quantities . apart of that , in the lower part of the considered domain of the electron density ( @xmath132 ) it is necessary to develop the method of determination of the dynamic conductivity which would take into account the presence of the plasma neutral component .",
