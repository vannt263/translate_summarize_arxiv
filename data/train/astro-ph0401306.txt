    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) can be broadly defined as the most luminous point - like extra - nuclear x - ray sources located within nearby galaxies , displaying x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath0 .",
    "these sources were first observed in observations of nearby galaxies ( e.g. fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ) , and more than one hundred were subsequently catalogued in high - resolution imager observations ( roberts & warwick 2000 ; colbert & ptak 2002 ) .",
    "whilst a fraction of this observed ulx population is associated with recent supernovae ( e.g. sn 1986j , bregman & pildis 1992 ; sn 1979c , immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) , studies have shown that many ulxs appear to display the characteristics of accreting black holes ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "2000 ; mizuno , kubota & makishima 2001 ) . crucially , high spatial resolution observations ( e.g. kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; strickland et al .",
    "2001 ) , have failed to resolve most ulx targets . when combined with the observed significant flux variability , this suggests the presence of a single , luminous source of x - rays rather than a grouping of less luminous sources .    however , debate over the nature of the bulk of the ulx population is ongoing , since if these are accretion - powered sources their x - ray luminosities match , and in many cases greatly exceed , the eddington limit for a typical stellar - mass ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) black hole .",
    "suggestions for their physical composition currently focus upon four possibilities .",
    "the first is that many ulxs are accreting examples of a new class of @xmath3 m@xmath2 intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh ; e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "the formation of such objects remains a matter of some debate ; some intermediate - mass black holes may be the remnants of primordial population iii stars ( e.g. madau & rees 2001 ) , whilst others may be formed in dense globular clusters prior to being deposited in a galaxy disc ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that imbh are formed by the runaway merger of stellar objects at the centre of young , dense stellar clusters ( ebisuzaki et al .",
    "2001 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) . the existence of imbh may be supported by the recent inferrence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 m@xmath2 massive dark objects in the cores of the globular clusters m15 and g1 respectively ( van der marel et al . 2002 ; gerssen et al . 2002 ; gebhardt et al . 2002 ) , though the presence of such an object in m15 is far from proven ( baumgardt et al .",
    "further evidence has recently emerged with the discovery of the x - ray spectral signature of `` cool '' accretion discs , consistent with the presence of imbh , in several ulxs ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2003 , roberts & colbert 2003 ) .",
    "the remaining models focus upon interpreting ulxs as extreme examples of `` ordinary '' stellar - mass ( i.e. @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the second physical model is that many ulxs are ordinary x - ray binaries in an unusually high accretion mode , in which their accretion disc becomes radiation pressure - dominated , producing photon bubble instabilities that allow the disc to radiate at a truly super - eddington x - ray flux ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "thirdly , many ulxs may only appear to exceed the eddington limit , but could in fact be x - ray binaries emitting anisotropically ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , with only a mild beaming factor @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the solid angle of the x - ray emission ) required in most cases to reduce the energy requirements below the eddington limit for a conventional stellar - mass black hole .",
    "the fourth model is a variation on the third scenario , suggested by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and more recently krding , falcke & markoff ( 2001 ) and georganopoulos , aharonian & kirk ( 2002 ) , in which ulxs are microquasars in nearby galaxies that we are observing directly down the beam of their relativistic jet ( `` microblazars '' , c.f .",
    "mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) .",
    "observational support for this last scenario comes from the detection of radio emission , potentially the signature of a relativistically - beamed jet , emanating from an ulx in ngc 5408 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "current observations do not completely rule out any of the above scenarios .",
    "however , they do suggest that there may be at least two separate underlying populations of ulxs , since a large number are seen coincident with active star formation regions ( e.g. zezas & fabbiano 2002 ; roberts et al .",
    "2002 ) and hence are presumably associated with nascent stellar populations , whereas some ulxs are found in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. irwin , athey & bregman 2003 ) and so must be associated with an older stellar population . king ( 2002 ) suggests that the population associated with star formation are high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) undergoing an episode of thermal - timescale mass transfer ( see also king et al . 2001 ) , whilst the older population may be long - lasting transient outbursts in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "local examples of each suggested class are ss 433 and grs 1915 + 105 respectively .",
    "this heterogeneity is supported by the first reported optical stellar counterparts to ulxs .",
    "roberts et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report the detection of a blue continuum source coincident with ngc 5204 x-1 , which resolved into three separate sources with colours that are consistent with young , compact stellar clusters in ngc 5204 ( goad et al .",
    "2002 ) . observations also show an ulx in m81 ( ngc 3031 x-11 ) to have a possible o - star counterpart ( liu et al .",
    "in contrast , ulxs have been found with potential globular cluster counterparts in both ngc 4565 ( wu et al . 2002 ) and ngc 1399 ( angelini , loewenstein & mushotzky 2001 ) , suggesting that these ulxs are associated with the older stellar population , or perhaps massive central black holes , of these globular clusters .    in this paper , we present the results of dual - epoch observations of five different ulxs located in nearby ( @xmath9 mpc ) galaxies , awarded time in ao-2 & ao-3 .",
    "these ulxs are listed in table  [ obsdetails ] .",
    "they were selected from the catalogues of hri point - like x - ray source detections in nearby galaxies presented by roberts & warwick ( 2000 ; hereafter rw2000 ) and lira , lawrence & johnson ( 2000 ) on the basis of their high x - ray luminosities ( l@xmath10 in the hri ) and the lack of previous observations .",
    "a discussion of the observational history of these ulxs is presented in appendix a. further discussion of the environment of each of these ulxs , as determined from william herschel telescope / integral ifu observations , will be detailed in a future paper ( roberts et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in the next section we briefly outline the details of the observations and the data reduction",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the detection of these ( and three other ) ulxs , and their locations within their host galaxies . in section 4",
    "we detail the spatial , temporal and spectral properties of each source , before discussing the implications of these results for possible physical models of ulxs in section 5 .",
    "our findings and conclusions are summarised in section 6 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ srcdiags ]    one immediate curiosity highlighted by table  [ srcdiags ] is that the two sources that display short - term variability appear very different .",
    "whilst both the sources are at the lower of their two observed luminosities when variable , their average x - ray spectra during this epoch contrast greatly , with cxou j120922.2 + 295600 displaying a hard powerlaw continuum ( @xmath11 ) whereas cxou j123558.6 + 275742 has a mcdbb form . the short - term variability and powerlaw spectral form of cxou j120922.2 + 295600 may be consistent with its x - ray emission in this state being dominated by a variable , possibly relativistically - beamed jet .",
    "however , the thermal accretion disc spectrum of cxou j123558.6 + 275742 argues against this interpretation .",
    "further studies of short - term variation in ulxs , based on higher signal - to - noise ratio data , have suggested a number of alternate physical mechanisms including rapid variations in the ulx accretion rate ( la parola et al . 2003 ) , magnetic reconnection events in the accretion disc corona ( roberts & colbert 2003 ) and an optically thick outflow ( mukai et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a related issue is the long - term variations in the x - ray spectra of these sources revealed by the data .",
    "we note , with reference to table  [ xspecfits1 ] , that all the spectra appear to show changes between the two observational epochs .",
    "we summarise these changes in figure  [ specvar ] by plotting the best - fit powerlaw photon index for each dataset against the derived intrinsic 0.5  8 kev x - ray luminosity for that observation .",
    "though figure  [ specvar ] highlights that the 90% confidence intervals for the photon index measurements overlap in almost all cases , consistent with little or no significant change in the photon indices , the best fit values do appear to show some level of variation .",
    "the data suggest that three of the ulx spectra are softer in a higher luminosity state , and three are harder .",
    "it has been noted elsewhere ( e.g. kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; la parola et al . 2001 ) that some ulx undergo a low / hard to high / soft state transition , reminiscent of the behaviour of classic galactic black hole x - ray binary systems .",
    "other recent observations have highlighted the opposite behaviour , i.e. a high state in which the spectrum is harder , for instance in m51 x-7 ( liu et al .",
    "2002 ) and in four out of five ulxs in the antennae ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2003 ) , one interpretation being that the accretion disc heats up ( and hence spectrally hardens ) as the luminosity of the system increases .",
    "the equal split between `` hardening '' and `` softening '' ulxs in our sample suggests that both transitions are common , implying either the ulx population is heterogeneous , with at least two flavours of accretors behaving differently , or that those sources composing the bulk of the ulx population are capable of displaying multiple states and modes of transition between those states .",
    "table  [ srcdiags ] also highlights a more spectacular flavour of spectral variation : components that appear to be present at one epoch but not during the other .",
    "this occurs in two of the ulxs . in cxou j120922.2",
    "+ 295600 we see a very soft component , fit by a mcdbb model with @xmath12 kev , that is present ( though only at @xmath13 confidence ) in the more luminous 2002 march observation but not in 2002 june . a similar soft ( @xmath14 kev ) mcdbb component has been reported in other ulx , notably from data for two ulxs in ngc 1313 ( miller et al .",
    "2003 ) , where it is interpreted as spectroscopic evidence for the `` cool '' accretion disc expected to be present around an imbh . in cxou j120922.2 + 295600",
    "this component disappears in the three - month period between observations .",
    "this could be analogous with a classic high / soft to low / hard state transition as seen in galactic black - hole x - ray binary candidates , but potentially involving an imbh system in this case .",
    "however , there are other potential explanations .",
    "perhaps the best alternative is that the soft component is originating in an optically - thick outflowing photosphere around a black hole x - ray binary , as suggested by mukai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to account for a highly luminous ultra - soft ulx in m101 ( a phenomenon also described as a `` black hole wind '' , see king & pounds 2003 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "such a component would have a blackbody spectrum with a temperature @xmath15 kev , consistent with the first epoch observation ( c.f .",
    "section 4.2.3 ) , and might easily switch off between the two observations of the ulx . however , there are arguments against the soft component originating in a black hole wind , most notably in the case of sources that also have a strong hard powerlaw continuum component in their spectrum ( e.g. m81 x-9 ; miller , fabian & miller 2003 ) . in this case",
    "the powerlaw component must originate in shocks outside the photosphere , but in order to have comparable luminosity to the soft component miller et al .",
    "argue that the photospheric radius must actually be of the order of the schwartzschild radius , implying no photosphere for these sources , and hence that the soft component must originate in the accretion disc .",
    "the other ulx to show a changing spectral form was cxou j123551.7 + 275604 . in this case",
    "the spectrum showed a marked softening between the two observations .",
    "earlier we noted that the additional soft flux present in the second - epoch could be modelled in terms of the emergence of soft ( @xmath16 kev ) optically - thin thermal emission in the ulx spectrum , which is not present five months earlier .",
    "since individual line features are not evident in the raw data , this interpretion is very model dependent and needs to be checked via future observations .",
    "bearing in mind these caveats we can , nevertheless , speculate as to how such thermal emission might be produced",
    ".    the putative mekal component is emitting an incredible @xmath17 of 0.5 8 kev x - ray luminosity if the emission is isotropic .",
    "to place this is context , this an order of magnitude greater than the integrated diffuse luminosity of several small nearby galaxies ( c.f .",
    "read , ponman & strickland 1997 ) .",
    "we note that cxou j123551.7 + 275604 might not be an unique system ; two other ulxs have been reported with possible thermal plasma components , with a similar very soft component reported on the basis of a joint pspc / spectral fit of the holmberg ii ulx by miyaji , lehmann & hasinger ( 2001 ) , and a much hotter and time - variable thermal component detected for an ulx in m51 ( terashima & wilson 2003 ) .",
    "what processes might produce thin - thermal plasma emission in the x - ray spectrum of a ulx ?",
    "miyaji , lehmann & hasinger ( 2001 ) suggest the presence of one or more supernovae in the immediate environment of the holmberg ii ulx , but we can reject this for cxou j123551.7 + 275604 given the rapid appearance of the plasma and the lack of a reported recent supernova at this position .",
    "in contrast , terashima & wilson ( 2003 ) draw an analogy to the x - ray spectrum of some hmxbs in eclipse , which are dominated by emission - lines that originate in photoionization of the stellar wind by the hard x - ray emission of the accreting primary ( e.g. cyg x-3 ; c.f .",
    "liedahl & paerels 1996 ) .",
    "however , we can not be observing thermal emission due to a reduction in contrast with the direct emission from the ulx , since we measure a higher overall flux in the second epoch observation when the plasma component is present . in any event",
    ", the plasma component we measure appears far too soft , at 0.18 kev , to be directly analogous to the photoionized stellar wind in sources such as cyg x-3 , which are typically identified by strong emission lines at energies well above 1 kev .",
    "the emission measure of the plasma is @xmath18 @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron density in atom @xmath19 and @xmath21 is the volume of the material .",
    "since the plasma is optically thin , it must satisfy the limit @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the pathlength through the plasma and @xmath24 is the thompson scattering cross - section . combining these two estimates gives @xmath25 km , implying that the plasma occupies a region far larger than the black hole accretion disc .",
    "however , as we argue above , it is probably too soft to be a photoionized stellar wind , which leaves the alternative possibility that it is a collisionally - ionized system",
    ". this could arise if an outflow from the ulx ( perhaps in the form of a relativistic jet ) impacts upon a cloud of material relatively close to the ulx .",
    "we further speculate that this scenario might occur if the secondary star in the system is an evolved high mass star , since these are known to eject discrete shells of material , for example with luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars thought to lose up to @xmath26 m@xmath2 yr@xmath27 in such discrete outburst events ( van der sluys & lamers 2003 and references therein ) . for the derived value of @xmath28 we calculate an electron density @xmath29 @xmath19 and hence a mass of @xmath30 m@xmath2 for the plasma , well within the ejection masses quoted above . to energize this mass of material to a temperature of @xmath31 kev",
    "requires an energy input of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total number of electrons in the plasma , hence a total of at least @xmath34 erg is required . in the 141 days between the observations",
    ", this would require an average mechanical energy input from the outflow of at least @xmath35 .",
    "we note that this energy input could be easily achievable by relativistic jets ; for example the w50 radio bubble surrounding ss 433 probably originates in inflation by the mildly - relativistic jets of ss 433 , with an average mechanical energy input from the jets of @xmath36 ( dubner et al .",
    "hence this scenario appears physically plausible .",
    "finally , we note that if the collisionally - excited material does originate in the ejection of matter from an evolved high - mass star , then this scenario is consistent with the suggestion of king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that ulxs are fed by thermal - timescale mass transfer from an evolved secondary star in a hmxb . however , it is not clear whether this system could be an `` ordinary '' hmxb containing a stellar - mass bh in accordance with the king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) model , as cropper et al .",
    "( 2003 ) conclude that its observational characteristics point towards it containing an imbh .",
    "clearly future monitoring of the behaviour of cxou j123551.7 + 275604 is required to resolve many the uncertainties as to its nature and in particular to investigate whether outflow / stellar material collision events occur in reality .",
    "in this paper we have studied dual - epoch observations of five nearby ulxs obtained with the acis - s detector . these have revealed heterogeneity in the observed properties of ulxs , from the characteristics of individual sources varying between the observation epochs , to a wide range of observed x - ray properties across the sample .",
    "the main outcomes of our analysis are :    * we detect all five target ulxs , though two have faded to luminosities below @xmath37 , plus we find three additional ulxs within the regions of the galaxies that we observe . *",
    "the ulxs are all likely to be associated with the young stellar populations residing in and around the star forming regions of their host galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the discovery of large ulx populations in starburst galaxies , extending the ulx  young stellar population link to `` normal '' spiral galaxies .",
    "we estimate that no more than two out of the eight ulxs originate in older stellar populations on the basis of the ulxs per unit optical luminosity measured in elliptical galaxies by colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) .",
    "* all the ulxs are point - like at the 0.5-arcsecond on - axis resolution .",
    "* we derive the spectral parameters for six ulxs in both observational epochs , finding that the majority ( five ) are best fit by a powerlaw continuum rather than a mcdbb model , contrary to some previous reports for ulxs ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "two of the five best fit by powerlaws require an additional , very soft spectral component in at least one observation . *",
    "extreme short - term variability ( on a timescale of hundreds of seconds ) is observed in only two ulxs , and in these sources it is only seen in one of two observations .",
    "however , all the ulxs with archival data are variable by factors of a 2  4 , over timescales of years . *",
    "the lack of short - term variability , unless it occurs on timescales much less than our temporal sampling , may indicate that the x - ray emission of ulxs as a class is not dominated by relativistically - beamed jets . * by utilising the new black hole state diagnostics of mcclintock & remillard ( 2003 ) , we see that four out of the five powerlaw - dominated spectra have photon indices consistent with the low / hard state .",
    "this challenges the recent assertions that powerlaw - dominated spectra in ulxs originate in the very high state .",
    "however , if this truly is the low / hard state it could pose problems for interpretations of ulxs involving anisotropic stellar - mass black holes , and the simplest explanation would be that we are seeing a low / hard state from accretion onto an imbh .",
    "the alternative is that we might be observing a state unique to the very high accretion rates required for stellar - mass black hole models .",
    "* we find that equal numbers of ulxs ( three apiece ) show spectral `` hardening '' and `` softening '' with increasing luminosity .",
    "this indicates either an underlying physical heterogeneity in the ulx population , or perhaps that the bulk of the ulx population is composed of sources that can behave in both ways .",
    "* the x - ray spectrum of cxou j123551.7 + 275604 is particularly interesting , in that it is possible that a very soft and luminous mekal component appears in the five months between the two observations .",
    "we speculate that this plasma ( if real ) originates in the impact of an outflow ( possibly relativistic jets ) from the ulx on material in its close vicinity .",
    "one possible source of this material could be in discrete mass ejection events from an evolved high - mass secondary star .",
    "the presence of an evolved high - mass companion star is consistent with the scenario suggested by king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , where many ulxs are ordinary hmxbs with an evolved high - mass secondary , though conversely this ulx is a very good candidate for an imbh .",
    "the properties outlined above portray ulxs as a class with very heterogeneous properties .",
    "whilst some trends are emerging , such as the likely relation between many ulxs and young stellar populations , the lack of observable short - term variability , and a preference for powerlaw continuum spectra , none of these provide conclusive observational evidence to distinguish between the competing physical models",
    ". it could be that much of the confusion is because ulxs are a physically heterogeneous class , including both stellar - mass black holes , many of which could be in hmxbs , and imbhs .",
    "perhaps , then , the question we should be addressing is : to what degree are the ulx populations heterogeneous ?",
    "an answer to this question is reliant upon future large samples of high - quality x - ray data , plus detailed multi - wavelength follow - up , to study these objects in much greater detail .",
    "it appears that we are still at the beginning of long road towards understanding these extraordinary x - ray sources .",

    "a subsequent hri observation detected ic 342 x-1 in a similarly luminous state ( bregman , cox & tomisaka 1993 ; rw2000 ) .",
    "an early observation showed ic 342 x-1 to be in a very luminous , highly variable state , in which its average 0.5  10 kev luminosity surpassed @xmath39 and it displayed large amplitude variability on @xmath40 s timescales ( okada et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this state",
    "its x - ray spectrum was well - fit by the multi - colour disc blackbody model describing an accretion disc around a black hole in a high / soft state ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , a follow - up observation obtained late in the mission showed the ulx to have dimmed to a luminosity of @xmath41 and undergone a spectral transition to a low / hard state , similar to the behaviour observed in many galactic and magellanic black hole x - ray binary systems ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; mizuno , kubota & makishima 2001 ) .",
    "however , the low / hard spectral state has recently been re - interpreted as a high / anomalous state where the x - ray spectrum is described by a strongly comptonised optically thick accretion disc , as observed in many galactic black - hole x - ray binaries experiencing a high mass accretion rate ( kubota , done & makishima 2002 ) .",
    "finally , recent william herschel telescope integral field unit observations have revealed that this ulx lies at the centre of a large nebula , probably a supernova remnant shell ( roberts et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the inferred initial energy input to the snr is consistent with a hypernova event , and highly excited [ oiii ] emission - line regions on the inner edge of the shell suggest that the ulx is photoionizing its inner regions to produce an x - ray ionized nebula .",
    "this source was first detected as `` point source 2 '' in a december 1979 ipc image of ngc 3628 , as reported by bregman & glassgold ( 1982 ) , where it was observed to lie at the eastern end of the edge - on galaxy disc .",
    "they derived a 0.3 - 2.9 kev luminosity of @xmath42 for ngc 3628 x-2 , corrected to our assumed a distance of 7.7 mpc ( this correction is assumed for all the following luminosities ) .",
    "however , the reprocessed ipc data contour map presented by fabbiano , kim & trinchieri ( 1992 ) suggests , in retrospect , that this flux may be an upper limit due to confusion with two x - ray sources since resolved to the north of x-2 .",
    "it was also detected in three separate observations , once with the pspc and twice with the hri , as reported in dahlem , heckman & fabbiano ( 1995 ) and dahlem et al .",
    "in particular , the november 1991 pspc observation provides a measurement of its x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2 kev band of @xmath43 , several times lower than the value .",
    "this apparent variability is supported by the hri images , which demonstrate that the count rate of ngc 3628 x-2 drops substantially between december 1991 and may 1994 .",
    "ngc 3628 x-2 was also detected in a december 1993 observation ( yaqoob et al .",
    "its sis spectrum was well - fit with a simple powerlaw continuum model , with @xmath44 and an absorption column of @xmath45 , well in excess of the foreground galactic column .",
    "this model implies luminosities of 0.7 and @xmath46 in the 0.5  2 and 2  10 kev bands respectively , consistent with the pspc measurement in the soft x - ray regime , though this must again be regarded as an upper limit due to the likelihood of confusion with other sources in the wide beam .",
    "yaqoob et al .",
    "( 1995 ) comment that the x - ray spectrum of ngc 3628 x-2 is consistent with either a low - mass x - ray binary or a very young supernova remnant , noting that if it is an accreting source then it is substantially super - eddington for a 1 m@xmath2 object .",
    "finally , ngc 3628 x-2 was not covered in the previous acis - s observation of ngc 3628 discussed by strickland et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , as their observation was aligned along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the first and , previous to this work , only detection of this ulx was made by lira , lawrence & johnson ( 2000 ) , who obtained a luminosity of @xmath47 ( corrected to a distance of 9.7 mpc ) from a hri observation of ngc 4136 .",
    "they note that its position is coincident with a diffuse blue optical counterpart , which may be emission knots in the spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    "ngc 4559 x-1 was first detected in the all - sky survey bright source catalogue as 1rxs j123551.6 + 275555 ( voges et al .",
    "it was identified with the outer edge of the galactic disc of ngc 4559 by vogler , pietsch & bertoldi ( 1997 ) , who present a detailed analysis of the x - ray properties of this source based on a pspc pointed observation . in their work",
    "they refer to this source as ngc 4559 x-7 .",
    "the pspc profile of the source is point - like , and no significant x - ray variability is detected from it during the observation .",
    "its spectrum is well - fit by either a powerlaw continuum ( @xmath48 ) or thermal bremsstrahlung model ( @xmath49 kev ) , both showing absorption @xmath50 , well in excess of the foreground galactic column .",
    "the observed ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) luminosity of @xmath41 converts to an impressive intrinsic luminosity of @xmath51 using the thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the pspc position is coincident with a group of emission knots in a faint outer spiral arm of the galaxy , which vogler et al .",
    "identify as likely regions .",
    "it is , however , too bright to be the integrated x - ray emission of `` ordinary '' x - ray binaries and supernova remnants associated with the region .",
    "they conject that this source is most likely a supernova remnant buried in a dense cloud of interstellar material , though they do not rule out either a black - hole accreting binary system , or mini - agn from a merging dwarf galaxy , as alternative identifications .",
    "this source was also detected , with a similar high x - ray luminosity , in a hri observation ( rw2000 ) .    unlike ngc 4559 x-1 , ngc 4559 x-4 was not detected in the all - sky survey bright source catalogue .",
    "however , in the pspc observation reported by vogler et al .",
    "( who list this ulx as ngc 4559 x-10 ) it was brighter than x-1 .",
    "it is located near , but not at , the centre of the galaxy .",
    "it appears as an extended source in the pspc observation , with about 20% of its flux emanating from between 20 and 50 arcseconds from the source centroid , which may be a diffuse component , or confusion with other point sources ( with our data suggesting the latter ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well - fit by either a powerlaw continuum , or thermal bremsstrahlung emission , albeit spectrally harder in each case than for x-1 ( @xmath52 , or @xmath53 kev , respectively ) , with a measured absorption column of @xmath54 .",
    "this gave an observed ( intrinsic ) luminosity of @xmath55 .",
    "vogler et al . suggest that x-10 is the superposition of several point sources , though they can not rule out the contribution of an agn towards the observed flux .",
    "this source is again also detected in the hri survey of rw2000 , offset from the nucleus of ngc 4559 by 13 arcseconds .",
    "this ulx was first detected in an ipc observation , with a 0.2  4 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath56 ( fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "it also appeared in the all - sky survey bright source catalogue with a count rate of @xmath57 .",
    "later hri pointed observations revealed ngc 5204 x-1 to lie @xmath58 arcseconds to the east of the nucleus of ngc 5204 ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; rw2000 ; lira , lawrence & johnson 2000 ) .",
    "this ulx was revealed to have a point - like optical counterpart with a blue continuum spectrum in a william herschel telescope integral field observation ( roberts et al .",
    "2001 ) , suggestive of the presence of several o - stars .",
    "a more detailed study using archival data resolved the ulx into three possible counterparts , all of which are consistent with young ( @xmath59 myr old ) compact stellar clusters in ngc 5204 , suggesting that this ulx may be a high - mass x - ray binary system ( goad et al ."
