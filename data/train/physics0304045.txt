    "when the scattering medium is made of moving particles , and this is the case in an atomic cloud , the amplitudes of the direct and reverse scattering sequences are no more linked by reciprocity and one observes a dynamical breakdown of the cbs effect @xcite .",
    "this reduction of the cbs enhancement factor depends on the velocity distribution of the particles and we can assert very generally that the interference contrast will not be much affected provided the velocity spread will not be too large . for moving resonant scatterers , we will see that `` not too large '' imposes a stringent condition which will require laser cooling techniques to be fulfilled .",
    "+ as a simplistic starting model , we neglect light polarization effects ( scalar wave approximation ) and describe atoms as highly resonant isotropic scatterers .",
    "the atomic resonance is characterized by a transition frequency @xmath9 in the optical domain and a transition width @xmath10 ( typically @xmath11 ) .",
    "the scatterers are then fully characterized by their complex electrical polarizability @xmath12 , with : @xmath13 since the scattering differential cross - section is @xmath14 where the total cross - section is @xmath15 .",
    "the velocity distribution of atoms has too major consequences : first the atomic response at each scattering has to be evaluated at a frequency @xmath16 which is _ randomly _ doppler - shifted .",
    "this means that each scattering has a variable strength and that the wave experiences a random phase - kick .",
    "furthermore , after scattering is completed , the wave has a frequency @xmath17 .",
    "scattering is _",
    "inelastic _ and propagation in an effective medium ( until the following scattering ) occurs with an optical index evaluated at random frequency . as an overall conclusion , there will be a random strength imbalance and a random dephasing between direct and reverse scattering sequences , leading to a reduction of the cbs interference .",
    "let us illustrate this dynamical breakdown for a peculiar double scattering path ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we consider an incoming resonant light wave ( frequency @xmath18 , wave - vector @xmath7 ) and , to simplify the discussion , we only consider the effect of dephasing between the paths . the total phase shift at backscattering ( @xmath19 ) is @xmath20 where @xmath21 corresponds to the dephasing accumulated during propagation in the effective medium and @xmath22 the dephasing accumulated at scattering events . in a dilute medium",
    "( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the spatial density ) , the expressions of @xmath21 et @xmath22 are quite straightforward : @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 the distance @xmath30 between scatterers is of the order of the scattering mean free path @xmath31 . the optical index @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 at first order in velocities",
    ", we get : @xmath34 and @xmath35 averaging over the gaussian velocity distribution of the two atoms leads to the interference contrast : @xmath36 where @xmath37 expression [ con ] shows that , to preserve the double scattering cbs effect , one needs : @xmath38 for scattering sequences of higher orders , one can argue that the scattering phaseshift roughly performs a random walk of step of order of @xmath39 , thus increasing as @xmath40 with scattering order @xmath41 .",
    "this puts a more stringent condition on the required velocity spread to preserve the cbs effect at higher orders . for atoms , @xmath42 , which means that the atomic gas has first to be laser - cooled before observing cbs",
    "this is done using a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    ".specific values of the double scattering contrast @xmath43 for different atoms and transitions",
    ". the cases of rb , sr and he@xmath44 correspond to dipole - allowed transitions . for the intercombinaison line cooling of sr ( at @xmath45 ) the transition is too narrow and dynamical",
    "breakdown occurs . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in a mot , due to the combined action of the zeeman and doppler effects , a restoring force spatially traps the atoms at the zero of the magnetic field gradient and cools them in velocity space ( for a review on cooling see _ e.g. _ w. phillips @xcite ) .",
    "the cooling action is based on a doppler - induced differential radiation pressure force between contra - propagating laser beams .",
    "for a two - level system in the low saturation limit and at low velocities ( @xmath46 ) , the average force is a pure friction force if the laser is red - detuned with respect to the transition ( @xmath47 ) . at steady state",
    ", this cooling mechanism is balanced by the heating mechanism induced by the random character of photon absorption and emission processes .",
    "the equilibrium state is then characterized by a gaussian velocity distribution with _",
    "rms _ value : @xmath48 where the recoil velocity @xmath49 is the velocity change during a single absorption or emission event . for the usual dipole - allowed transitions ,",
    "the recoil frequency shift is small with respect to the width of the transition @xmath50 thus equation [ critere ] is well fulfilled in a mot and the dynamical breakdown of the cbs effect should be negligible in most cases ( see for example table [ tab ] ) .",
    "moreover , when @xmath51 , extra cooling mechanics , the so - called sisyphus cooling @xcite , lower the final _ rms _ velocity with respect to relation ( [ limdop ] ) .    for rb ,",
    "the mot is loaded in a cell from a low - pressure thermal vapour and for sr from an effusive atomic beam .",
    "the total number of trapped atoms is determined by a balance between trapping and loss mechanisms ( _ e.g. _ atom - atom collisions ) .",
    "it usually ranges from @xmath52 to @xmath53 atoms in standard operating conditions .",
    "however for localization experiments , it is crucial to achieve an optical depth at least larger than unity to reach the multiple scattering regime .",
    "this requirement is usually satisfied in a mot using a resonant probe beam .",
    "it can be also interesting to achieve a high spatial density for strong localization experiments where @xmath54 is demanded .",
    "unfortunately , in most cases , multiple scattering is the dominant limiting factor @xcite and spatial densities in a mot are generally limited to a few of @xmath55 implying @xmath4 .",
    "[ polar ]    in section [ vitesse ] , we saw how the velocity distribution of atoms can alter the cbs contrast .",
    "another important suppression mechanism of the cbs interference effects has been pointed out in reference @xcite .",
    "it is related to the internal degrees freedom of the scatterers .",
    "in fact , the optical dipole transition connects two zeeman - degenerate multiplets ( in the absence of a magnetic field ) .",
    "the groundstate ( resp .",
    "excited ) multiplet has a total angular momentum @xmath56 ( resp .",
    "@xmath57 ) and contains @xmath58 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) magnetic levels . to fully describe scattering",
    ", one needs to specify the initial and final groundstate levels .",
    "two types of transitions can occur : those leaving the internal state unaffected ( rayleigh transitions ) and those changing the internal state ( raman transitions ) .",
    "thus , when calculating the cbs cone one has to take properly into account all those allowed mechanisms . note that since all levels in a given multiplet have same energies , light scattering is always _",
    "elastic_. however scattering is no more described by the atomic polarizability alone and one now needs the _ full scattering tensor_. in other words , _ non scalar _ features of scattering will become essential .",
    "+ it can be shown that the internal structure has two major consequences .",
    "first , because raman transitions are unavoidable and since they are accompanied by a change of light polarization at backscattering ( see figure 2b ) , the single scattering contribution is no more suppressed in the @xmath3 channel .",
    "this leads to a rather trivial cbs contrast reduction since the same would occur with classical _ non - spherically symmetric _ scatterers .",
    "second , and this point is more subtle , the interfering amplitudes are no more linked in general by reciprocity .",
    "this is because under time - reversal the angular momentum of atoms has to be flipped .",
    "this leads to unbalanced amplitudes for the direct and reverse scattering sequences and to a decrease of the cbs contrast as soon as @xmath51 @xcite . in the @xmath3 channel",
    ", it can be shown that this contrast reduction can be attributed to the antisymmetric part of the scattering tensor @xcite .",
    "for @xmath60 ( absence of internal structure in the groundstate ) , one recovers the previous classical result .",
    "figure 3 shows the cbs cone for the four usual polarization channels and for two different transitions in a semi - infinite medium . for the @xmath61 transition , cones shape and height",
    "are the same than for a classical dipole - like scatterer . for the @xmath62 transition ,",
    "the enhancement factor is systematically lower for all polarization channels .",
    "transition , the enhancement factor is systematical lower for all polarization channels when compared to the @xmath61 case where cbs cones are the same than for a classical dipole - like scatterer . ]    [ thcbs ]",
    "the detailed experimental procedure for the cbs observation has been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , the signal is obtained using a collimated resonant probe with a beam waist bigger than the size of the cloud ( @xmath63 ) . to avoid any effects linked to the saturation of the optical transition ( non - linearities , inelastic radiation spectrum ) @xcite ,",
    "the probe intensity is weak ( saturation parameter @xmath64 ) .",
    "the scattered light is collected in the backward direction by placing a ccd camera in the focal plane of an achromatic doublet .",
    "the cbs cone plots shown in figure 4 are obtained in the @xmath3 polarization .",
    "as predicted , the enhancement factor is strongly reduced for the rb transition .",
    "however a quantitative comparison with theory calls for some care since the calculation assumes an homogeneous semi - infinite medium whereas the rb experiment is made on a finite sample of gaussian - distributed atoms . in this type of geometry , it is clear that the weight of long scattering paths are overestimated with respect to the finite size sample case . besides",
    ", theoretical calculations show that the major contribution of the cbs cone comes from low scattering orders .",
    "thus , considering only the single and double scattering events , the enhancement factor is predicted to be @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the experimental value thus interpolates nicely these two extreme predictions . for the sr experiment ,",
    "the enhancement factor is found to be @xmath66 , slightly lower the theoretical prediction @xmath67 .",
    "several experimental issues can explain the difference ; the finite angular resolution of the detection apparatus and the imperfect polarization channel isolation @xcite . in figure [ rbsr ] , the experimental sr cbs cone",
    "is compared to a monte - carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "the agreement is clearly excellent .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the internal structure and the velocity distribution of resonant scatterers like atoms have a deep impact on the cbs effect .",
    "the dynamical breakdown induced by the motion of the scatterers can be made negligible at the expense of using laser - cooled atoms .",
    "unfortunately , the internal structure irrevocably leads to very small enhancement factors in all polarization channels as soon as the atomic groundstate is degenerate .",
    "this has been evidenced by experiments on rubidium .",
    "restoration of a full interference contrast is obtained with non degenerate atoms like in the strontium experiment .",
    "this should have interesting potentialities for wave localization experiments with cold atoms .",
    "for example , in the quest for anderson localization ( which could be obtained only at high density where @xmath68 ) where interferences play a crucial role , a @xmath69 transition appears to be a good choice .",
    "is it now possible to increase the cloud density to reach the anderson localization threshold ? for this purpose , cooling strontium with the intercombination line in a dipole trap appears to be a promising technique @xcite .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge d. delande for stimulating discussions and for monte - carlo simulations on the sr cbs cone .",
