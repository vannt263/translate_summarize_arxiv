    "this talk is mainly concerned with the question , `` what do form factors really measure ? '' , and secondarily with the question , `` what is the relation between form factors and the orbital angular momentum of the objects that make up the neutron or proton ? '' .",
    "the article @xcite , which contains more details , is the source the present presentation .",
    "a way to focus the discussion is to ask yourself the question , `` what is the charge density at the center of the nucleon ? ''",
    "the neutron has no net charge , but the charge density need not vanish .",
    "so we can ask , `` is the central charge density negative or positive ? '' .",
    "this talk provides a surprising answer .",
    "there are long - standing existing answers based on models @xcite .",
    "the neutron can make a spontaneous quantum transition to a state consisting of a proton and a @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the relatively light pion can spread out over a larger region of space than the proton .",
    "hence one expects that the charge density is negative at the edge of the neutron and positive at the center .",
    "the same result is obtained with very different logic from the one - gluon exchange mechanism @xcite , which acts repulsively between two negatively charged d - quarks .",
    "but enough talk about models ! here we shall be concerned with model independent information .",
    "we shall begin with a discussion of electromagnetic form factors .",
    "this will be followed by a discussion of light cone coordinates and the relevant kinematic subgroup of the group .",
    "then the definitions of generalized parton distributions gpds and a bit of math lead to the key result @xcite that the two - dimensional fourier transform of the electromagnetic form factor @xmath0 gives the charge density @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance from the transverse center of mass , and no information about the longitudinal momentum or position is available",
    ". then the data analysis will be discussed , and an attempt at providing an interpretation will be made . but really , finding an accurate interpretation is anyone s game .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors are matrix elements of the current operator , @xmath6 , between nucleon states of different momentum :",
    "p,| j^(0)| p,=|u(p,)(^f_1(q^2)+iq_f_2(q^2 ) ) u(p,),where the momentum transfer @xmath7 is taken as space - like , so that @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the nucleon polarization states are chosen to be those of definite light - cone helicities @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the charge ( dirac ) form factor is @xmath0 , normalized such that @xmath11 is the nucleon charge , and the magnetic ( pauli ) form factor is @xmath12 , normalized such that @xmath13 is the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the sachs form factors@xcite g_e(q^2)f_1(q^2)-f_2(q^2 ) , g_m(q^2)f_1(q^2)+f_2(q^2),[sachsff]were introduced to provide an expression for the electron - nucleon cross section ( in the one photon exchange approximation ) that depends on the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 but not the product @xmath16 . in the breit frame ,",
    "in which @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the nucleon helicity flip matrix element of @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the scattering of neutrons from the electron cloud of atoms measures the derivative @xmath20 at @xmath21 , widely interpreted as six times the mean - square charge radius of the neutron . however , any probability or density interpretation of @xmath18 is spoiled by a non - zero value of @xmath22 , no matter how small @xcite .",
    "this is because the initial and final states have different momentum , and therefore relativistically have different wave functions .",
    "the factorization of relative and center of mass wave functions that is obtained from the non - relativistic galilean invariance is not obtained relativistically .",
    "the internal wave function depends upon the total momentum of the nucleon .",
    "any attempt to analytically correct for the total momentum by incorporating relativistic corrections in a @xmath23 type of expansion would be doomed , by the presence of the very light current quark mass , @xmath24 , to be model - dependent .",
    "that is , at small values of @xmath22 , one finds g_e^n~q^2 ( d^3r ( r^2 ||^2 + ) , where the first term represents the traditional effect depending on the square of the wave function and the unknown coefficient @xmath25 represents the correction due to the total momentum of the system .",
    "these useful coordinates involve the use of a `` time '' x^+=(ct + z)/=(x^0+x^3)/.the corresponding evolution operator is the not the hamiltonian , @xmath26 , but instead p^-=(p^0-p^3)/.the orthogonal spatial coordinate is x^-= ( x^0- x^3)/.if one quantizes at @xmath27 , then @xmath28 , and this why @xmath29 is thought of as the spatial variable .",
    "the canonically conjugate momentum is given by p^+= ( p^0 + p^3)/.we note that p_x^=p^-x^++p^+x^.the transverse coordinates perpendicular to the 0 and 3 directions are denoted as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the lorentz transformation defined by a transverse velocity @xmath32 has properties very similar to that of galilean transformations . under these transformations",
    "k^+k^+ + -k^+*v*,[tvb ] and @xmath33 transforms so that @xmath34 is not changed .",
    "transverse boosts are like non - relativistic boosts according to eq .",
    "( [ tvb ] ) .",
    "this means that one may use @xcite nucleon states that are transversely localized .",
    "the state with transverse center of mass @xmath35 set to 0 is formed by taking a linear superposition of states of transverse momentum : |p^+,*r*= * 0 * , |p^+,*p * , .",
    "[ eq : loc ] where @xmath36 are light - cone helicity eigenstates @xcite and @xmath37 is a normalization factor . the relevant range of integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) must be restricted to @xmath38 to maintain the interpretation of a nucleon moving with well - defined longitudinal momentum@xcite .",
    "thus we use the infinite momentum frame , for which the nucleon may accurately be regarded as a set of a large number of partons .",
    "using eq .  ( [ eq : loc ] ) sets the transverse center of momentum of a state of total very large momentum @xmath39 to zero , so that transverse distance @xmath30 relative to @xmath35 . can be defined .",
    "thus we may define a useful combination of quark - field operators : _ q(x,*b * ) _",
    "+ ^(-,*b * ) q_+(,*b * ) e^ixp^+x^- , [ eq : bperp ] where the subscript @xmath40 denotes the use of only independent quark field operators .",
    "the impact parameter dependent pdf is defined @xcite as the matrix element of this operator in the state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) : q(x,*b * ) p^+,*r*= * 0 * , | _ q(x,*b * ) |p^+,*r*= * 0 * , .",
    "[ eq : def1 ]    the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def1 ] ) allows one to show @xcite that @xmath41 is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the gpd @xmath42 : q(x,*b*)=e^ih_q(=0,x , t=-^2),[ft1 ] with @xmath42 appearing because the initial and final helicities are each @xmath43 .",
    "one finds a probability interpretation @xcite by integrating @xmath41 over all values of @xmath44 .",
    "this sets the value of @xmath29 to 0 , so that dxq(x,*b * ) p^+,*r*= * 0 * ,    the matrix elelment .",
    "if one multiplies the above relation by the quark charge @xmath45 ( in units of @xmath46 ) , sums over quark flavors , uses eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) with @xmath47 along with the sum rule relating the gpd to the form factor , the resulting infinite - momentum - frame imf parton charge density in transverse space is ( b)_q e_qdxq(x,*b*)= f_1(q^2=^2)e^i .",
    "we exploit eq .",
    "( [ rhob ] ) by using measured form factors to determine @xmath4 .",
    "recent parameterizations @xcite of @xmath18 and @xmath48 are very useful so we express @xmath0 in terms of @xmath49 . then @xmath4 can be expressed as an integral involving known functions : ( b)= _ 0^ j_0(q b),[use]with @xmath50 and @xmath51 a cylindrical bessel function .",
    "the charge density of the proton is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and that for the neutron in fig .",
    "the proton density seems to be well determined , using the entire range of the parameterization @xcite , which greatly overestimates the errors , leads to little variation .",
    "the surprising feature is the negative central value of the neutron charge density .",
    "this results from the negative definite nature of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the neutron density is sensitive to unknown values of @xmath0 at high @xmath22 .",
    "cutting off the integral appearing in eq .",
    "( [ use ] ) at @xmath52 leads to big changes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the neutron charge density has interesting features , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which displays the quantity @xmath53 .",
    "it is the integral of this quantity that integrates to 0 .",
    "the neutron charge density is negative at the center , positive in the middle , and again negative at the outer edge .",
    "the medium - ranged positive charge density is sandwiched by inner and outer regions of negative charge .",
    "one can gain information about the individual @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark densities by invoking charge symmetry ( invariance under a rotation by @xmath54 about the @xmath55 ( charge ) axis in isospin space ) @xcite so that the @xmath56 densities in the proton are the same as the @xmath57 densities in the neutron .",
    "we also neglect the effects of @xmath58 @xcite or heavier pairs of quarks . in this case",
    "@xmath59 the results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and are that the central up quark density is larger than that of the down quark by about 30% .",
    "model independent information about parton distributions has been obtained @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the central density of the neutron is negative .",
    "one possible interpretation is that quarks with high orbital angular momentum do not penetrate the interior , but the negatively charged pion , with only one unit of orbital angular momentum can both penetrate the interior and exist at long ranges .",
    "if this is the case , the negatively charged pions would be suppressed at medium range , allowing the related density to be positive .",
    "future measurements of neutron electromagnetic form factors could render the present results more precise , or modify them considerably .",
    "obtaining a qualitative and intuitive understanding of our results presents a challenge to lattice qcd and to builders of phenomenological models .",
