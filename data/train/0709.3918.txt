    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is the best motivated physics beyond the standard model , as it provides a solution to the hierarchy problem , a natural candidate of the dark matter of the universe , and leads to the unification of the gauge coupling constants . but",
    "susy must be broken spontaneously in some sector hidden from the observable sector , and the effect of susy breaking must be communicated to the observable sector by some mediation mechanism .",
    "there are many proposed susy breaking and mediation mechanisms , such as gravity - mediation , gauge - mediation @xcite and anomaly - mediation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , supergravity in four space - time dimensions is believed to be low - energy effective theory of the more fundamental higher - dimensional theory , superstring theory @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental problems to obtain such a four dimensional theory from string theory is that there appear many moduli which are not stabilized when the extra dimensions are compactified .",
    "also the light moduli cause cosmological disaster related to the huge entropy production from the late - time modulus decay @xcite or the runaway behavior of the dilaton @xcite .",
    "recently , kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) @xcite provided a concrete example of the model construction which stabilizes all the moduli .",
    "motivated by these recent developments , low - energy consequences of kklt - type moduli stabilization mechanism were investigated @xcite .",
    "it is found that this type of models leads to the mixture of modulus- and anomaly - mediation contributions to the susy breaking parameters , and such models are called mirage - mediation or mixed - modulus - anomaly - mediation models .",
    "phenomenologically , there are some interesting features in mirage - mediation models .",
    "one of the good points in mirage - mediation models is that they do not suffer from extra cp phases between the contributions from modulus- and anomaly - mediation .",
    "another is that because of the heavy gravitino mass ( @xmath0 tev ) , the cosmological gravitino problem @xcite may be significantly relaxed . for some model parameters , the little hierarchy problem can also be relaxed @xcite .",
    "however , as for the cosmological issues , there remains other problems to be solved . in mirage - mediation models , there exists a modulus field with mass of order @xmath1 and whose interactions with other particles are suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "it is likely that the energy stored in the coherent oscillation of the modulus field once dominates the universe , and reheats the universe with very low reheating temperature order @xmath2 mev releasing huge entropy .",
    "this invalidates the standard thermal relic dark matter scenario , and also significantly dilutes the preexisting baryon asymmetry .",
    "thus there is a need for investigating a consistent cosmological scenario which can account for the present dark matter and baryon number of the universe in the presence of such a heavy modulus field .    in order to obtain correct amount of baryon asymmetry ,",
    "a large baryon number density should be generated which can even survive the dilution from the modulus decay , and perhaps the only known mechanism which can create such a large baryon number is the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that affleck - dine baryogenesis mechanism can create the desired amount of baryon asymmetry in the presence of large dilution .    in this paper",
    ", we study the possibility of nonthermal production of the dark matter directly from the modulus decay and find that the enhancement of the annihilation cross section due to the s - channel higgs resonance makes it possible to account for the correct relic abundance of the dark matter for some parameter regions . a solution to the moduli - induced gravitino problem",
    "@xcite is also discussed . a similar subject",
    "was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of anomaly - mediated susy breaking scenario .",
    "our present work can be regarded as the extension of their work to the mirage - mediation model , where the presence of moduli is necessary and inevitable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mirage ] the properties of mirage - mediation models are briefly described . in sec .  [ sec : cosmology ] , the cosmology with heavy moduli is discussed . in particular ,",
    "the nonthermal dark matter from modulus decay and its detection possibility at on - going and future direct detection experiments are investigated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : moduliinduced ] solutions to the moduli - induced gravitino problem are proposed .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the mirage - mediation models .",
    "the k@xmath3hler potential , superpotential and gauge kinetic fuction are assumed to be of the form ( hereafter we set the reduced planck scale @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the modulus field and @xmath7 denotes the mssm superfields and @xmath8 .",
    "the subscript @xmath9 distinguishes the matter species , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real constants .",
    "the value of @xmath12 are determined by the concrete model setup , but here we regard them as free parameters which characterize the phenomenological properties .",
    "this type of the k@xmath3hler potential and superpotential of the modulus arises from string theoretical construction such as the kklt model .",
    "the scalar potential for the modulus is given by @xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( here the subscript @xmath6 denotes partial derivative with it ) .",
    "the resulting minimum of this potential is a supersymmetric ads vacuum . in order to obtain ds vacuum , we add the additional uplifting potential from the brane sequestered from the observable sector , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is @xmath18 constant",
    ". then the total scalar potential is given by @xmath19 .",
    "after fine - tuning the value of @xmath20 , we can obtain correct ds vacuum with positive vacuum energy density observed now .",
    "this model has interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "there are two sources of susy breaking in the present model .",
    "one comes from the uplifting brane , which gives the dominant contribution to the susy breaking and determines the mass of gravitino . on the other hand ,",
    "at the ds minimum after uplifting the modulus has non - vanishing @xmath21-term .",
    "this also gives susy breaking effect .",
    "roughly speaking , the resulting susy breaking parameters are determined by the combination of anomaly - mediated susy breaking effect which comes from uplifting brane and modulus - mediated susy breaking effect which comes from the modulus itself .",
    "the contribution to the gaugino masses , sfermion masses and @xmath22 terms from the modulus - mediation at gut ( grand unified theory ) scale are denoted as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are related to @xmath12 .",
    "then we define the following parameters which distinguish mirage - mediation models , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 which describes the ratio of the anomaly - mediation to modulus - mediation contribution to the susy breaking parameters .",
    "thus mirage - mediation models are parameterized by the following parameters @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the up - type and down - type higgs , @xmath30 .",
    "we assume @xmath31 , as positive @xmath32 is favored from the muon @xmath33 experiment .",
    "when the renormalization group equations are applied to obtain low - energy mass spectrum , one finds that the gaugino masses at the energy scale @xmath32 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36gev .",
    "thus they are unified at the scale @xmath37 , which is called the mirage - scale , although there are no new physics at this scale . note that gauge coupling constants unification at the gut scale is not modified . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the mirage - scale actually becomes intermediate scale , @xmath39 gev . for @xmath40",
    ", it becomes @xmath41 tev .",
    "this case is called tev scale mirage - mediation .",
    "one of the interesting properties of mirage - mediation models is that there exists a modulus field whose interaction is planck - suppressed .",
    "it is found that the modulus mass around its potential minimum is estimated as @xmath42 . because the gravitino mass is one or two - orders of magnitude larger than the other susy particle masses",
    ", the modulus mass is expected to be @xmath43 tev .",
    "the modulus with such a large mass decays well before big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and hence it seems harmless for cosmology .",
    "but the typical decay temperature of the modulus is much lower than the freeze - out temperature of the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) , which invalidates the standard thermal relic scenario . in the next section",
    ", we consider the nonthermal production of the lsps directly from the modulus decay .",
    "after inflation ends , the modulus is likely to dominate the universe before the decay because of its large energy density stored in the form of scalar condensates with large initial amplitude of order the planck scale .",
    "thus the final radiation dominated regime is realized after the modulus decay .",
    "the final reheating temperature is estimated as @xmath44 where we have used the decay rate of the moduli , @xmath45 with @xmath18 constant @xmath46 .",
    "this satisfies the lower limit on the reheating temperature from bbn @xcite , but is well below the typical freeze - out temperature of the lsp , @xmath47 gev where @xmath48 denotes the mass of the lsp .",
    "thus we can neglect the production process of the lsps in the thermal bath around the epoch of the modulus decay .",
    "the relevant boltzmann equations for the lsp , modulus and radiation are @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the thermally averaged annihilation cross section of the lsp , mev due to scattering with background particles in thermal bath @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the number density of the lsp and modulus , @xmath53 denotes the radiation energy density , @xmath54 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath55 denotes the branching ratio of the modulus decay into gauginos , which is roughly the same order as that into gauge bosons . for @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the lifetime of the moduli , the evolution of the lsp number density is well described by @xmath58 changing the variable to @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the entropy density , this equation can be integrated under the assumption that the relativistic effective degrees of freedom ( @xmath61 ) remains constant . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xcite @xmath62^{-1}.    \\label{ynonthermal}\\ ] ] the initial abundance of the lsp @xmath63 is given as @xmath64 thus in the relevant parameter region , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ynonthermal ] ) always dominates and the final relic abundance of the lsp is inversely proportional to the annihilation cross section similar to the usual thermal relic scenario @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the larger annihilation cross section is required to obtain the desired amount of dark matter since the decay temperature of the modulus is much lower than the freeze - out temperature of the lsp .    then , whether the desired amount of dark matter is obtained or not crucially depends on the properties of the lsp . in mirage - mediation models ,",
    "the lightest neutralino naturally becomes the lsp and it is the mixture of bino and higgsino . for small @xmath65 , where the modulus - mediation effect dominates , the lightest neutralino is mainly bino - like . as the value of @xmath65",
    "is increased , the anomaly - mediation contribution reduces the mass of the gluino , which leads to lighter stop mass and smaller @xmath66 value .",
    "thus for large @xmath65 the higgsino - like lsp is also viable .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2-m350 ] for @xmath67 gev , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where the subscript @xmath54 denotes the higgs fields and @xmath71 denotes other matter fields . in the following analysis , we have used modified darksusy routine @xcite to calculate the annihilation cross section and spin - independent neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "the purple shaded region is excluded from the @xmath72 constraint . in the blue shaded region",
    "stop becomes the lsp .",
    "the gray band shows the favored region from the observation of wmap three year results @xcite . in the calculation of the relic abundance of the dark matter ,",
    "only the s - wave contributions are included since the velocity of dark matters is very tiny and its effect on the annihilation cross section can be safely neglected .",
    "the coannihilation effects are also less important since the coannihilating particles decay very quickly compared to the rate of annihilation processes .",
    "thus they are not included in our analysis .    in general , the bino has small annihilation cross section and is not suitable candidate of the nonthermal dark matter .",
    "but in mirage - mediation models there are relatively large parameter regions where an enhancement from the s - channel higgs resonance ( also called @xmath22-funnel ) is obtained .",

    "although the decay rate of moduli into gravitinos depends on the details of the susy breaking sector @xcite , it is worth mentioning here the case where such a decay mode is not suppressed .",
    "the abundance of gravitinos produced directly from the modulus decay is given by @xmath89 if the gravitinos decay well before bbn , the produced lsps overclose the universe .",
    "if the gravitinos decay after bbn starts , the decay process disturbs bbn @xcite .",
    "both constraints require the additional entropy production , which dilutes the gravitinos by an amount of @xmath90 after the production of gravitinos by the modulus decay .",
    "a concrete example of such an entropy production is the late decay of q - balls @xcite , which are non - topological solitons formed through affleck - dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "this model requires no additional fields other than mssm fields , and it is interesting since the q - ball decay not only solves the moduli - induced gravitino problem , but also can provide the correct amount of baryon asymmetry @xcite .",

    "the resulting abundance of nonthermal lsps is given by similar manner to the case of modulus decay .",
    "in both cases , the q - ball ( or flaton ) decay into gravitinos is obviously suppressed since their interaction is not gravitationally suppressed , or such a decay mode can be kinematically forbidden since the gravitino is heavy enough .    in fig .",

    "note that the resulting lsp abundance is inversely proportional to @xmath93 , so @xmath93 can not be as low as 10 mev .",
    "contrary to the case with moduli , the decay temperature of the q - ball ( flaton ) @xmath93 is not directly related to model parameters . but",
    "in order to dilute the gravitinos produced by the modulus decay , @xmath93 should not be so large .     as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "parameters are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2-m350 ] . ]",
    "in this paper , we studied the possibility of nonthermal dark matter from the modulus decay in mirage - mediation model , motivated by the cosmological consideration that the modulus likely to dominate the universe before the decay and its decay temperature is very low .",
    "it is found that through the s - channel higgs resonance , the annihilation cross section of binolike neutralino can be enhanced and the correct amount of dark matter can be remained .",
    "although the parameter region which gives such a feature is constrained from the @xmath72 bound and higgs mass bound , the nonthermal production scenario of the dark matter from the modulus decay is viable for natural parameters around @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 gev .    on the other hand , if the moduli decay into gravitinos with unsuppressed branching ratio , such gravitinos cause cosmological problems .",
    "in order to avoid the difficulty , the additional late - time entropy production is needed .",
    "q - balls or thermal inflation flatons may be the possible candidates which give sufficient entropy production .",
    "we have also shown that although their late decay may invalidate the nonthermal dark matter scenario from the moduli , their decay itself can again produce the sizable amount of dark matter non - thermally . in the q - ball scenario , not only the dark matter abundance but also the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be explained simultaneously .",
    "our final comment is that such non - thermally produced neutralinos can not be the warm dark matter , since they can not freely stream without losing their energy due to the scattering with background particles . in this respect ,",
    "the missing satellite problem @xcite or the cusp problem @xcite should be solved without referring to the nature of the dark matter ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if any , nonthermal production scenario of the dark matter may have distinct implications on the collider and direct / indirect dark matter detection experiments and is interesting as a probe of the cosmological evolution scenario before bbn .",
    "generally , in supergravity or superstring - inspired theory , there appear long - lived scalar fields whose late decay disturbs the standard thermal history of the universe .",
    "thus we believe it is important to seek a consistent cosmological scenario taking into account the dynamics of such harmful scalar fields in the hidden sector .      for reviews ,",
