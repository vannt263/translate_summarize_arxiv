    "phase transition phenomena in spontaneously broken quantum field theories have long been a subject of importance and interest due to their wide range of possible applications , going from low energy phenomena in condensed matter systems to high energy phase transitions in particle physics and cosmology ( for reviews , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to thermal effects , phase transition phenomena are also known to be triggered by other external effects , like , for example , by external fields . in particular , those changes caused by external magnetic fields have attracted considerable attention in the past @xcite and received reinvigorated interest recently , mostly because of the physics associated with heavy - ion collision experiments . in heavy - ion collisions , it is supposed that large magnetic fields can be generated , and the study of their effects in the hadronic phase transition then became subject of intense interest ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "magnetic fields can lead in particular to important changes in the chiral / deconfinement transition in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite and even the possibility of generating new phases  @xcite    as far the influence of external magnetic fields and thermal effects on phase transformations are concerned , one well known example that comes to our mind is the physics associated with superconductivity , in particular in the context of the ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite .",
    "let us recall in that case thermal effects alone tend to produce a phase transition at a critical temperature where superconductivity is destroyed and the system goes to a normal ordered state .",
    "the phase transition in this case is second order .",
    "however , in the presence of an external magnetic field , but below some critical value , by increasing the temperature the system undergoes a first order phase transition instead .",
    "this simple example already shows that magnetic fields may have influence on the phase transition other than we would expect from thermal effects alone .",
    "there are also other examples of more complex systems where external magnetic fields may have a drastic effect on the symmetry behavior . among these effects , besides the possibility of changing the order of the phase transition , as in the ginzburg - landau superconductor , it can in some circumstances strengthen the order of the phase transition , like in the electroweak phase transition in the presence of external fields @xcite , or there can also be dynamical effects , like delaying the phase transition @xcite .",
    "external magnetic fields alone can also lead to dynamical symmetry breaking ( magnetic catalysis ) @xcite ( for an earlier account , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    likewise",
    ", nonperturbative effects may affect the symmetry properties of a system , once the external parameters are changed , in a way different than seeing through a purely perturbative calculation , or by a mean - field leading order description .",
    "this is because perturbation theory is typically beset by problems , for example around critical points , due to infrared divergences , or at high temperatures , when powers of coupling constants can become surmounted by powers of the temperature ( see e.g. the textbooks  @xcite for extensive discussions ) .",
    "thus , high temperature field theories and the study of phase transitions in general require the use of nonperturbative methods , through which large classes of terms need to be resummed .",
    "familiar techniques used to perform these resummations include , for example , ring diagram ( or daisy and superdaisy ) schemes  @xcite , composite operator methods  @xcite and field propagator dressing methods  @xcite .",
    "other methods used include also numerical lattice studies and expansions in parameters not related to a coupling constant , like the @xmath0 expansion and the @xmath1-expansion  @xcite , the use of two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective actions  @xcite , hard - thermal - loop resummation  @xcite , variational methods , like the screened perturbation theory  @xcite and the optimized perturbation theory ( opt )  @xcite",
    ". of course , any resummation technique must be implemented with care so to avoid possible overcounting of terms and lack of self - consistency .",
    "failure in not following this basic care can lead to a variety of problems , like predicting nonexistent phenomena or producing a different order for the phase transition .",
    "one classical example of this was the earlier implementations of daisy and superdaisy schemes , that at some point were giving wrong results , e.g. predicting a first order transition  @xcite for the @xmath2 theory , an unexpected result since the model belongs to the universality class of the ising model , which is second order .",
    "these methods have also initially predicted a stronger first order phase transition in the electroweak standard model , a result soon proved to be misleading  @xcite .",
    "these wrong results were all because of the wrong implementation of the ring - diagram summation at the level of the effective potential , as clearly explained in the first reference in  @xcite    in this work we will analyze the phase transition for a self - interacting complex scalar field model and determine how an external magnetic field , combined with thermal effects , affects the transition .",
    "all calculations will be performed in the context of the opt nonperturbative method .",
    "our reasons for revisiting here the phase transition in this model are two - fold .",
    "first because this same model has been studied recently in the context of the ring - diagram resummation method  @xcite , where it was found that the ring - diagrams render the phase transition first order and that the effect of magnetic fields was to strengthen the order of the transition and also to lower the critical temperature for the onset of the ( first order ) phase transition .",
    "so in this work we want to reevaluate these findings in the context of the opt method .",
    "we recall , from the discussion of the previous paragraph , that the ring diagram method requires special attention in its implementation and that previous works have already concluded erroneously about its effects on the transition .",
    "the opt method has a long history of successful applications ( for a far from complete list of previous works and applications see e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the opt method automatically resums large classes of terms in a self - consistent way so to avoid possible dangerous overcounting of diagrams . in our implementation of the opt here , we will see that already at the first order in the opt it is equivalent to the daisy and superdaisy schemes .",
    "the opt then provides a safe comparison with these other nonperturbative schemes .",
    "in particular , to our knowledge , this is the first study of the opt method when considering the inclusion of an external magnetic field .",
    "finally , we also want to properly treat the effects of small magnetic fields ( which requires summing over very large landau - levels ) in an efficient way , particularly suitable for numerical work .",
    "this way we can evaluate in a precise way the effects of external magnetic fields ranging from very small to very large field intensities ( in which case , in general , just a few landau - levels suffice to be considered ) . for this study we will make use of the euler - maclaurin formula and fully investigate the validity of its use as an approximation for the landau level sums for different ranges for the magnetic field .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and explain the application of the opt method for the problem we study in this paper .",
    "it is shown explicitly which terms are resummed by the opt .",
    "we also verify that the goldstone theorem is fulfilled in the opt . in sec .",
    "iii we study the phase transition in the spontaneously broken self - interacting quartic complex scalar field in the opt method , first by incorporating only thermal effects and then by including both temperature and an external magnetic field . in sec .",
    "iv we study the advantages of using the euler - maclaurin formula for the sum over the landau levels .",
    "the accuracy and convergence of the method is fully examined .",
    "we determine that the sum over the landau levels , in the regime of low magnetic fields , where typically we must sum over very large levels so to reach good accuracy , can be efficiently performed within the very few first terms in the euler - maclaurin formula . as an application , an analytical formula for the critical temperature for phase restoration , as a function of the magnetic field , @xmath3 ,",
    "is derived .",
    "our final conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v. finally , an appendix is included to show some of the details of the renormalization of the model in the context of the opt .",
    "in our study we will make use of a self - interacting quartic complex scalar field model with a global @xmath4 symmetry and spontaneously symmetry breaking at tree - level in the potential , whose lagrangian density is of the standard form ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 for spontaneously symmetry breaking .",

    "the implementation of the opt in the lagrangian density is the standard one  @xcite , where it is implemented through an interpolation procedure ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the lagrangian density part with the renormalization counterterms needed to render the theory finite . in @xmath19 ,",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 is a bookkeeping parameter used only to keep track of the order that the opt is implemented ( it is set to one at the end ) and @xmath21 is a ( mass ) parameter determined variationally at any given finite order of the opt .",
    "a popular variational criterion used to determine @xmath21 is known as the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) , defined by the variational relation  @xcite    @xmath22    which is applied to some physical quantity @xmath23 , calculated up to some order-@xmath24 in the opt . the optimum value @xmath25 , which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ pms ] ) , is a function of the original parameters of the theory and it is in general a nontrivial function of the couplings .",
    "it is because of the variational principle used that nonperturbative results are generated .",
    "other variational criteria can likewise be defined differently , but they produce the same final result for the quantity @xmath23 , as shown recently  @xcite .    in terms of the interpolated lagrangian density , eq .",

    "previous demonstrations of the goldstone theorem in the opt were for the linear sigma model  @xcite and for the @xmath58 nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is noticed from the pms equation given above , eq .",
    "( [ etabar ] ) , that the opt naturally resums the leading order loop terms of the field s self - energy .",

    "@xcite , and contrary to the results found in that reference , we have found again here only a second order phase transition . for the analogous parameters used in @xcite ( see observations made in previous subsection ) , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath122 , the change of the critical temperature in relation to the @xmath123 case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is only to produce a slight shift of the critical temperature to a value @xmath124 higher . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we have plotted the vev of the field for the case of zero magnetic field and for a much higher value of the magnetic field , @xmath125 , so to be able to visualize the difference .",
    "even so , the difference even for such value of magnetic field is only marginal , changing the critical temperature obtained at @xmath123 , @xmath126 , to @xmath127 for the value of @xmath98 used . in all cases",
    "we have tested for a nonvanishing magnetic field and other different parameters of the potential , the transition is again verified to be second order , with the vev varying always continuously from its value at @xmath91 to zero at @xmath128 .",
    "when working with quantum field theories in a magnetic field , we need to deal with the sum over the landau levels . at @xmath91",
    "this does not present a problem in general , since we can express the expressions in terms of zeta functions .",
    "we have seen this in the previous section , where all terms at @xmath91 were presented in analytical form .",
    "however , at finite temperature this is not possible in general , therefore , we either need to numerically perform the sums over the landau levels , or find suitable approximations for the expressions .",
    "this job becomes easier in the high magnetic field regime , with @xmath129 , for which most of the time suffices to use only the very first terms of the sum , or even just the leading landau level term .",
    "higher order terms are quickly boltzmann suppressed in this case . but",
    "this is not so in the low magnetic field regime , with @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , where most of the time requires to sum up to very large landau levels .",
    "this has the potential to make any numerical computation to become quickly expensively , specially when there are in addition numerical integrations involved , like in our case here ( note that we have not made use of high temperature approximations , but worked with the complete expressions in terms of the temperature dependent integrals ) .",
    "simple approximate analytical results , which are always desirable to obtain , can also become difficult to obtain without a suitable approximation that can be used .",
    "one such approximation was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is valid only for very small magnetic fields . here",
    "we discuss a more natural alternative for dealing with the cases of low magnetic fields , based on the euler - maclaurin formula .",
    "the euler - maclaurin ( em ) formula provides a connection between integrals and sums .",
    "it can be used to evaluate finite sums and infinite series using integrals , or vice - versa . in its most general form",
    "it can be written as  @xcite :    @xmath132   + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{b_{2i}}{(2i)!}\\left[f^{(2i-1)}(b ) -    f^{(2i-1)}(a)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int_{a}^{b } \\frac{b_{2n+1}(\\{x\\})}{(2n+1 ) ! }   f^{(2n+1)}(x)\\,dx\\ ; , \\label{em}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath133 are the bernoulli numbers , defined by the generating function    @xmath134    and @xmath135 are the bernoulli polynomials , with generating function    @xmath136    the notation @xmath137 in @xmath138 in eq .",

    "( [ emy ] ) and ( [ emx ] ) , when extending them up to 4th - order . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from the results shown in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , we see that the em approximation produces results that already at first order have good accuracy compared to the exact values coming from the full landau sums .",
    "it performs particularly very well for values of @xmath147 , reaching convergence within just the very first few terms in the expansion .",
    "however , for values @xmath148 , increasing the order in the em series , it quickly looses accuracy .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that as we go to a higher order in the derivatives appearing in the sum on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) , higher powers of @xmath145 are produced , eventually spoiling the approximation ( though it oscillates around the true value ) .",
    "this apparent runaway behavior is only cured by the introduction of the last term in eq .",

    "it should be noted that eq .",

    "this is a tremendous advantage , since eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) can easily be coded , compared to having to perform sums over very large landau levels ( particularly in the cases of low magnetic fields ) and the multiple integrations that may be required .",
    "given all the advantages of using the em formula , it is quite surprising that it is not used frequently in physics , despite being well known in mathematics . in particular",
    ", we see that it is well suitable in problems involving external magnetic fields . to our knowledge ,",
    "one of the few works that we are aware of that have previously made use of the em formula before were for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the author derived the effective potential of the abelian - higgs model , including both thermal effects and an external magnetic field , in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the em formula was used at its zeroth order ( by just transforming the sum in an integral ) to obtain analytical results for the effective potential in the high magnetic field region .",
    "but from the results of tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , this is exactly the region and order in the approximation that lead to the largest errors . in @xcite",
    "the em formula was used to obtain an expression for the effective potential for vector bosons and to study pair production in an external magnetic field , while in @xcite it was used to obtain analytical expressions for the internal energies for non - interacting bosons confined within a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "none of these previous works have assessed the reliability of the use of the em formula .    as an application of the em formula to our problem",
    ", we estimate from it the dependence of the critical temperature with the magnetic field .",
    "recall from eq .",
    "( [ varphitc ] ) the critical temperature can be obtained by setting @xmath146 and @xmath51 in the equation for the vev .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ varphitb ] ) , we need to solve the equation    @xmath150    as we have seen from the results of tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , the em formula for low magnetic fields produce reliable results already at the second order , and for very small magnetic fields , good precision is reached even at first order .",
    "thus , for example from the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ emx ] ) , and performing the @xmath24 integral in the first term , we obtain    @xmath151    where @xmath152 .",

    "using the result ( [ aproclxa ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ xtb ] ) and then back in eq .",
    "( [ tcbeq ] ) , after some algebra , we obtain the approximate result for the critical temperature as a function of the magnetic field ,    @xmath160    the result ( [ tcb ] ) shows the growth of the critical temperature with the magnetic field , as seen numerically from the results obtained in the previous section .",
    "a comparison with our previous results also shows that eq .",
    "( [ tcb ] ) provides an excellent fit for @xmath3 , leading to results with less than @xmath161 error compared to the full numerical results for @xmath81 , for values of field such that @xmath162 .",
    "for example , for the parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 , the approximation ( [ tcb ] ) gives @xmath165 , while the full numerical calculation gives @xmath166 .",
    "in this paper we have revisited the phase transition problem for the self - interacting complex scalar field model when thermal effects and an external magnetic field are present .",
    "we have studied this problem in the context of the nonperturbative method of the optimized perturbation theory .",
    "we have shown that the opt method preserves the goldstone theorem and that carrying out the approximation to first order is analogous to the ring diagram resummation method .",
    "the opt carries out the resummation of self - energy diagrams in a self - consistent way , avoiding overcounting issues , which have previously plagued the ring diagram method in its very early applications .    by using the opt method ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the phase transition in the model is always second order in the presence of thermal effects and by including an external magnetic field , there is no change to the phase transition order .",
    "the effect of the external magnetic field is to strengthen the symmetry broken phase , producing a larger vev for the field and also a larger critical temperature .",
    "the study we made in this paper considered only the effects of the magnetic field and temperature on the charged scalar field ( the model is one with a global @xmath4 symmetry ) .",
    "our study , in a sense , is closer to the case of studying the effects of @xmath98 and @xmath40 in the linear sigma model  @xcite , where no couplings to gauge fields ( except to the external field ) are considered in general .",
    "the inclusion of other field degrees of freedom , or when promoting the symmetry from a global one to a local symmetry , can of course change both qualitatively and quantitatively how the magnetic field affects the system .",
    "in particular , as concerning the possibility of producing a first order phase transition , either due to thermal effects , or by a magnetic field or from both . this is what we expect in the context of the scalar qed , where due to the screening of the magnetic field in the broken phase , the phase diagram and transition are very different .",
    "the phase structure can also be very different when adding other interactions and having other symmetries .",
    "for example , in the context of the electroweak phase transition  @xcite , it has been shown that the effect of the magnetic field is to make the first order transition stronger . by omitting vacuum energy terms from the effective potential , which may have phenomenological motivations , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , may also lead to a first order transition , instead of a second order one .    still comparing our results with those obtained in the abelian higgs model",
    ", there is a tantalizing question of whether for very strong magnetic fields a new phase could be formed .",
    "this could be for example a phase with global vortices condensation , thus restoring the symmetry again .",
    "this would be in analogy to the local , nielsen - olesen vortex conndensation that can happen in type ii superconductors  @xcite .",
    "vortex condensation in that case is energetically favorable to happen for fields beyond a critical value and when the mass of the higgs field becomes larger that the mass of the gauge field .",
    "this is an interesting possibility to investigate in the future .    as an aside , but a complementary part of this work , we have verified the reliability of the use of the euler - maclaurin formula as an approximation for the sum over landau energies in a magnetic field .",
    "we have verified that it produces results with errors of less than @xmath167 already at the first few orders in the em formula and that it leads to particularly suitable approximations in the low magnetic field region ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the low magnetic field region is typically the region where we have to face the problem of summing over very larger number of landau levels , which , in practice , can be overwhelming in terms of cpu time , when working numerically .",
    "the em formula in this case can be a very valuable tool , both for numerical computations , but also for obtaining approximate analytical results , which would be otherwise very difficult through the use of the landau sums directly . as an application of the em formula , we have obtained an approximate expression for the dependence of the critical temperature with the magnetic field in our problem .",
    "we expect that the em formula can also be used in many other applications involving the effects of magnetic fields in phase transitions , like in condensed matter problems or in the recent interest in studying the effects of magnetic fields in the qcd phase transition .",
    "furthermore , our results ( including the use of the opt method ) can also be of interest in the study of cosmological phase transitions in general .",
    "magnetic fields can be easily generated in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "these fields can then influence subsequent cosmological phase transitions or also be important in particle physics phenomena in the early universe .",
    "works in those contexts are in progress and we will report on them elsewhere .",

    "first , note that the interpolation procedure in the opt method , eq .",
    "( [ interpol ] ) , introduces only new quadratic terms , thus , it does not alter the renormalizability of the original theory .",
