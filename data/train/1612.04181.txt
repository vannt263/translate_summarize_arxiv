    "placing a grain of a metal salt at the bottom of a sodium silicate solution results in the formation of a branching aggregate that grows spontaneously upward .",
    "this phenomenon , which appears similar to the growth of a plant , is referred to as a chemical garden  @xcite .",
    "the essential factor for the growth of a chemical garden is the formation of silica gel from mixing of the metal salt and sodium silicate solution .",
    "when a grain of metal salt is placed in a sodium silicate solution , a membrane made of silica gel , through which water can permeate , covers the salt .",
    "the concentration of salt in the solution inside and outside of the membrane is different , which results in osmotic pressure .",
    "the membrane expands due to this osmotic pressure and finally ruptures . in this way",
    ", a dense aqueous solution of metal salt is ejected from the membrane , which in turn is surrounded by the silica gel membrane . this process is thus repeated and results in a branch - like aggregate .",
    "such chemical gardens are a manifestation of a coupling of hydrodynamics and solidification .",
    "hydrodynamic flow is generated by osmotic pressure , and solidification occurs when the metal salt and sodium silicate solution mix to form silica gel .",
    "this same coupling of hydrodynamics and solidification is also relevant for both geophysical conditions  @xcite and cellular motility  @xcite .",
    "such systems often contain various chemicals and biological agents , and thus a simplified physical view would be valuable for predicting the behavior of these systems . therefore , it is of interest to produce a system where various spatio - temporal patterns appear according to the physical parameters that arise from a coupling of hydrodynamics and solidification  @xcite .    a simplified 2-dimensional ( 2d )",
    "chemical garden system was recently invented by a belgium group  @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the system is constrained to be 2d by the use of a thin cell , known as a hele - shaw cell .",
    "one of two aqueous solutions of cobalt chloride and sodium silicate is placed in the cell , and the other solution is injected mechanically from the center of the cell . in this way , the hydrodynamic flow is imparted externally .",
    "mixing of these two solutions results in the formation of silica gel  @xcite , i.e. , solidification . in their report",
    ", various spatio - temporal dynamics were identified , such as the formation of algae , shells , and filaments , by changing the concentration and the chemical species .",
    "therefore , the 2d chemical garden is a desirable candidate for exploration of the coupling of hydrodynamics and solidification .",
    "however , previous work has mainly used variation of the chemical parameters , while changes to physical parameters such as the flow rate and cell thickness have not been systematically examined . therefore , we have focused on the influence of physical parameters on 2d chemical garden formation .",
    "cells with different thickness were filled with sodium silicate solution , into which cobalt chloride solutions were injected at various rates .",
    "these two solutions were set to have similar viscosities , so as to rule out the possibility of a typical saffman - taylor instability , i.e. , viscous fingering  @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the report by haudin et al . , where the chemical composition was changed , variation of the physical parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 resulted in three different patterns . furthermore , these patterns were successfully characterized according to the order parameters of circularity @xmath4 , and the variance of areal velocity , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the area and the perimeter of the injected fluid , respectively .",

    "@xmath4 was small and became close to zero when the filament pattern appeared ( fig .",

    "[ flower](b ) . significant fluctuation in the areal velocity @xmath15 , and hence large @xmath1 , despite a constant injection rate @xmath2 , indicated that the generated aggregate did not span the entire gap , i.e. , the aggregate had a 3d structure .",
    "furthermore , due to slow front motion ( ca .",

    "the estimated pressure drop between the gauge and the injection point was 0.2 pa  @xcite , which is negligible compared with the measured pressure .",

    "the shell pattern is characterized by a repeated extension of a smooth injection front with a smooth boundary ( fig .",
    "[ shell](a ) ) .",
    "this resulted in a trace with a shell - like texture , for which the period was typically 2 mm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ shell](b ) . even though the extension of the rim had temporal oscillations , @xmath15 was almost constant overall ( fig .",
    "[ shell](c ) ) . the constant increase in the injected area , in addition to the small @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "the estimated pressure drop between the gauge and the injection point was 60 pa  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interface advanced with a pressure on the order of a few pascals , which is the smallest among the three observed patterns .",
    "it should also be noted that the pressure is comparable to the pressure required to inject a simple viscous liquid into the cell  @xcite .",
    "a similar shell structure was reported in the case when water glass was injected into a cobalt chloride solution  @xcite , but not in the opposite case .",
    "the difference between the present study and that reported by haudin et al .",
    "@xcite can be attributed to the concentration difference ( higher cobalt chloride concentration and different composition of water glass ) , in addition to a different injection speed . as reported in  @xcite",
    ", the coexistence of shell and filament patterns at the marginal value of @xmath2 was also observed in the present study .",
    "when @xmath2 was sufficiently large , the front of the injected fluid branched to form multiple fronts , i.e. , a filament pattern ( fig .  [ filament](a ) ) .",
    "the front exhibited irregular meandering and splitting , in contrast to typical viscous fingering due to the saffman - taylor instability  @xcite .",
    "however , the fluctuation in @xmath15 was small , as shown in fig .",
    "[ filament](b ) , which resulted in small @xmath1 . to quantify the branching dynamics ,",
    "the number of active ( mobile ) filaments @xmath17 was counted during filament growth over time . to enumerate the number of active filaments , difference images were constructed from snapshots separated by a fixed time , @xmath26 . here , @xmath27 is the time span to have the same total areal increment @xmath28 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this study ,",
    "@xmath29 mm@xmath30 was selected .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 = 30 ml / min and @xmath3=0.75 mm , then @xmath26 = 0.04 s. in this way , the advancing front is extracted and the fronts of areas larger than 1.3 mm@xmath31 are counted as actively moving filaments .",
    "in addition to @xmath17 , the speed of the moving front @xmath32 was also measured , which represents the speed of the filaments .",
    "figure  [ filament](c ) shows a typical time course for the number of active filaments @xmath17 ; the number of moving fronts @xmath17 initially increased with time and then satuated at finite value , @xmath33 .",
    "this can be also observed by the peak in the histogram of the observed number of active filaments ( fig .",
    "[ filament](d ) ) . for @xmath3 = 0.75 and 1.2 mm , @xmath34 and @xmath35 were obtained from four independent measurements for each parameter with @xmath2 , where a bar denotes the temporal average .",
    "@xmath34 was proportional to @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ filament](e ) ) , whereas the front velocity @xmath35 was almost the same for all @xmath3 and @xmath2 , with large fluctuations shown in figure  [ filament](f ) .",
    "the typical pressure observed with @xmath2 = 100 ml / min was 40 kpa .",
    "the estimated pressure drop between the gauge and the injection point was 2 kpa  @xcite , which is negligible with respect to the measured pressure .",
    "therefore , the interface advances in filament pattern with a pressure of approximately 40 kpa .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the difference between an alga pattern with a flower pattern reported in  @xcite .",
    "they both show color change during the front propagation .",
    "recently , the relevance of saffman - taylor instability was suggested for the formation of flower patterns  @xcite .",
    "however , an alga pattern was observed with small viscosity contrast between an inner fluid and an water glass , and with small injection speed compared with  @xcite , and the possiblity of the saffman - taylor instability was ruled out .",
    "for this reason , we decide to name the pattern as an alga pattern , different from a flower pattern .",
    "from the pressure measurement , the key factor for an alga pattern with a 3d structure is the formation of narrow fractures . the pressure required to advance the liquid increases inside such fractures .",
    "such dynamics involve microscopic cracking of the 3d aggregate , coupled with sequential chemical reactions indicated by the color change of the aggregate .",
    "to understand the mechanism for the formation of an alga pattern requires a detailed study of the sequential chemical reactions and shear effects , and will thus be the subject of future study .",
    "in contrast , the injection pressure required for a shell pattern was almost the same as that required for injection of a simple fluid with the same viscosity into the cell  @xcite .",
    "therefore , despite the appearance of a complex pattern at the trace of the moving front , the dissipation in the shell pattern is essentially due to a viscosity effect .",
    "a further increase in @xmath2 resulted in an increase in the injection pressure to about 10 kpa . at first consideration",
    ", this appears to be contradictory because an increase in @xmath2 leads to a shorter reaction time and the aggregate should be less solidified .",
    "therefore , the results suggest that the main factor influencing the dissipation of the filament pattern is not the viscosity of the liquid .",
    "we speculate that this paradox is due to thin lubrication layer between the silica gel and the substrate that appears at the front of the injected fluid .    .",
    "typical outward normal velocity is represented by @xmath36 and the local density of silica gel is represented by @xmath37 .",
    "( b ) decrease in @xmath37 due to the curvature effect .",
    "( c ) simplified situation where the advancing tip moves with velocity @xmath38 and width @xmath39.,width=325 ]    based on our speculation , a mathematical model was developed for the most interesting filament pattern .",
    "this modeling involved extension of the 2d boundary dynamics model developed for the drying processes of wet granular materials  @xcite .",
    "here , the developed model includes the effect of silica gel precipitation as an obstacle to movement of the interface .",
    "the water glass / inner fluid interface is assumed to be a moving boundary @xmath40 .",
    "the variable @xmath37 was adopted to indicate the local density of silica gel at the moving boundary , for which the normal velocity is denoted by @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ model](a ) ) .",
    "the precipitation does not diffuse ; therefore , the dynamics of @xmath37 can be determined by the geometrical effect , which is given by : @xmath41 @xmath37 increases with time due to reaction between the water glass and inner fluid .",
    "here , the first term corresponds to the reaction , and @xmath37 is considered to increase linearly with time , and is thus assigned the coefficient @xmath42 for simplicity .",
    "the second term corresponds to the geometrical factor , and @xmath43 is the curvature of @xmath40 .",
    "the unit length in the moving interface increases to be @xmath44 with each unit of time ; thus , the density of precipitation at the interface effectively decreases ( fig .",
    "[ model](b ) )  @xcite .",
    "the motion of the interface is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the mobility of the interface under the influence of thin lubrication layer between silica gel and the substrate , and @xmath46 is modeled by : @xmath47    the interface is stopped by an increase in @xmath37 , and this effect is taken as the function @xmath1 , where @xmath36 becomes 0 when the silica gel density @xmath37 , reaches @xmath48 .",
    "the interface is pushed by the pressure difference across the boundary @xmath40 , denoted as @xmath49 , whereas it is hindered by the laplace pressure @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the complete dynamics of the interface can be described by eqs .",
    "( [ sim : eq1 ] ) and ( [ sim : eq2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the proposed boundary model can be a differential form of the model previously proposed for a spiral pattern  @xcite .    to elucidate the essential features of this model , a situation is considered where the curvature @xmath51 and the normal velocity @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to the tip of a steadily advancing filament , of which the velocity and width are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ model](c ) ) . in this case",
    "( [ sim : eq1 ] ) and ( [ sim : eq2 ] ) are expressed as : @xmath53 and @xmath54    by inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq_v ] ) into eq.([eq_sig ] ) , the steady - state condition , @xmath55 , leads to : @xmath56 to have a real root for @xmath37 , the condition for @xmath57 is obtained as : @xmath58 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ineqdeltap ] ) corresponds to the effect of the laplace pressure , so that the increase of the filament size @xmath39 leads to a smaller injection pressure being required to overcome the laplace pressure . on the other hand , the second term results from the geometrical effect that reduces the local concentration of the silica gel , which will be smaller when @xmath39 is smaller .",
    "thus , there are optimal conditions for filament growth under minimum pressure .",
    "this minimum pressure can be easily calculated from : @xmath59 where equivalency is attained if and only if @xmath60 .",
    "when equivalency is fulfilled , the pressure difference @xmath57 takes the minimum value @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . in summary ,",
    "( [ eq_sig ] ) and ( [ eq_v ] ) for the tip of an active filament have a minimum @xmath57 for the steady state . under this condition ,",
    "the advance of one filament will require a flow rate of @xmath64 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath65 is dependent only on the geometrical parameter @xmath3 and the physical properties @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the existence of a minimum pressure difference for the growth of filaments explains the experimental observations for the filament pattern .",
    "initially , when the inner fluid is injected into a cell , the number of filaments increases due to fluctuation of the interface as a result of inherent noise in the experimental system . at this stage",
    ", the injection pressure can be higher than @xmath68 .",
    "however , as the number of active filaments increases , the pressure becomes small , and finally reaches @xmath68 .",
    "if the number of active filaments increases further , then the pressure becomes smaller than @xmath68 , i.e. , advance of the filaments is halted . in this way",
    ", the number of active filaments becomes saturated , so that all the active filaments fulfill the minimum pressure condition , @xmath68 . at this stage",
    ", each filament requires @xmath65 for a tip to advance .",
    "thus , the saturated number of active filaments @xmath33 , can be obtained by @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , as long as a filament pattern appears , the number of active filaments is proportional to the injection rate @xmath2 , whereas the rate of advance of the active filament is determined by @xmath70 .",
    "the analysis of filament patterns revealed that the number of active filaments was saturated at @xmath34 , where @xmath34 was almost proportional to the injection rate of the inner fluid , @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the average velocity @xmath71 did not change with @xmath2 .",
    "the initial increase in the number of active filaments requires further discussion .",
    "our preliminary numerical calculations for the boundary dynamics showed that the model tended to show tip - splitting , which is reported as double spiral formation in  @xcite .",
    "we consider that this tip splitting is one of the main factors for the increase in the filament number .",
    "in addition to the pressure effect and inhibition of the boundary collision , the @xmath33 dependence on @xmath2 can be reproduced .",
    "analysis of the numerical calculations will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "filament patterns have been often observed in various systems where flow and solidification are coupled  @xcite , such as in biological systems  @xcite .",
    "saturation of the number of actively moving filaments was also noted in  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the proposed boundary model can be a simple mathematical model to determine the fingering patterns generated by the coupling of flow and solidification within a confined geometry .",
    "active stress generation can also be included in the dynamics , such that spontaneous droplet deformation due to aggregate formation could also be modeled  @xcite .",
    "in this study , various patterns generated due to a coupling of flow and solidification in a hele - shaw cell were investigated .",
    "variation of physical control parameters , such as the injection rate @xmath2 and the thickness of the cell @xmath3 was examined .",
    "three distinctive patterns were noted : algae , shells and filaments .",
    "these patterns were well classified by the circularity @xmath4 and by the variance of areal velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the large @xmath1 determined for alga patterns suggests that these patterns possess 3d structure , even under a confined quasi-2d condition .",
    "the filament pattern has small @xmath4 , which indicates filament growth .",
    "detailed analysis of the dynamics of the filament pattern indicated that the number of actively growing filaments becomes saturated with time at @xmath34 , which was almost proportional to the injection rate @xmath2 .",
    "the velocity of the growing filament @xmath35 was not affected by the change in @xmath2 .",
    "a larger cell thickness @xmath3 resulted in smaller @xmath34 but almost the same @xmath35 .",
    "measurement of the injection pressure revealed the smallest injection pressure at the injection point for a shell pattern , which can be explained by the simple viscosity effect of the solution .",
    "this suggests that a different mechanism for dissipation is predominant for the filament pattern .",
    "based on these observations , a 2d boundary dynamics model was constructed with existence of thin lubrication layer between the silica gel and the substrate at the growth front .",

    "<S> the injection front showed three distinctive patterns : algae , shells , and filaments , which were solely dependent on physical parameters such as the injection speed and cell thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the injection pressure and the spatio - temporal pattern of the injected fluid were measured , and a significant increase in the injection pressure was observed when the filament pattern appeared , which indicated the existence of thin lubrication layer between the silica gel and the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the filament pattern was further analyzed quantitatively , and the number of active filaments was determined to be proportional to the injection speed . </S>",
    "<S> a mathematical model was constructed that considered both the viscous effect from the thin lubrication layer between the silica gel and the substrate and the laplace pressure , and this successfully reproduced the characteristic filament dynamics . </S>"
