    "correlations of particles between different regions of rapidity have for a long time been considered to be a signature of new physics . a shortening in the correlation length in rapidity",
    "has been thought to signal a transition to a quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "conversely , the appearance of long - range correlations has been associated with the onset of the percolation limit , also linked to the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "recently , the correlations across a large distance in rapidity have also been suggested to arise from a color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "the observation of such correlations in a+a collisions at rhic energies by the star collaboration @xcite has therefore elicited a lot of theoretical interest .",
    "the purpose of this work is to identify some _ baseline _ contributions to the experimentally observed correlations , contributions that do not depend on new physics .",
    "we will use models that incorporate event - by - event fluctuations in initial conditions : a ` toy ' wounded nucleon model and the hadronic string dynamics ( hsd ) transport model to illustrate the effect of these contributions .",
    "we then argue that a study of the dependence of correlations on the centrality bin definition as well as the bin size may distinguish between these ` trivial ' correlations and correlations arising from ` new physics ' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the main observables are introduced . in sections iii and",
    "iv we study system size fluctuations and the resulting centrality dependence of correlations of two disconnected regions in momentum space within two different models : the glauber monte carlo model ( with no hadronic re - interactions or initial state dynamics ) and the hsd transport model .",
    "section v summarizes our study .",
    "the statistical properties of a particular sample of events can be characterized by a set of moments or cumulants of some observable .",
    "these properties depend upon a set of criterions which are used to select this sample . applied to the context of heavy - ion collisions this translates to the construction of centrality bins of collision events from minimum - bias data .",
    "we will discuss the charged hadron multiplicities @xmath0 and @xmath1 in two symmetric intervals @xmath2 of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "after construction of the centrality bins , one can calculate the moments of a resulting distribution @xmath3 : @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the subscript @xmath5 denotes a particular centrality bin , while the superscript @xmath6 denotes the separation of two symmetric intervals @xmath7 in pseudo - rapidity space where particle multiplicities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are measured . the correlation coefficient and reserve the letter @xmath8 for the impact parameter . ]",
    "is defined by @xmath9 and measures how strongly multiplicities @xmath0 and @xmath1  in a given centrality bin @xmath5 for pseudo - rapidity separation @xmath6  are correlated . in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for symmetric intervals .    the recent preliminary data on forward - backward correlation coefficient ( [ eq2 ] ) of charged particles by the star collaboration @xcite exhibit two striking features :   a ) an approximate independence on the width of the pseudo - rapidity gap @xmath6  ,   b ) a strong increase of @xmath12 with centrality .",
    "we use the phobos glauber monte carlo code @xcite coupled to a ` toy ' wounded nucleon model , referred to as gmc .",
    "the aim of this model is to emphasize two crucial aspects : 1 )  an averaging over different system sizes within one centrality bin introduces correlations ; 2 )  the strength of these correlations depend on the criteria used for the centrality definition and on the size of the centrality bins .    employing the glauber code we model the distribution of the number of participating nucleons , @xmath13 , in each nucleus - nucleus collision for given impact parameter @xmath8 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] , _ left _ ) .",
    "this is done for au+au with standard wood - saxon profile and the nucleon - nucleon cross section of @xmath14  mb .",
    "the ` event ' construction proceeds then in a two - step process .",
    "firstly , we randomly generate the total number of charged particles : @xmath15 where the number of charged particles @xmath16 per participating nucleon are generated by independently sampling a poisson distribution with given mean value @xmath17 .",
    "secondly , these charged particles are randomly distributed according to a gaussian in pseudo - rapidity space : @xmath18 where @xmath19 defines the width of the pseudo - rapidity distribution .",
    "hence , in each single event there are no correlations between the momenta of any two particles .",
    "note that numerical values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fixed in a way to have a rough correspondence with the data on charged particle production at @xmath22  gev .    in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] ( _ left _ ) we show the gmc event distribution in the @xmath23-plane . for each of these events",
    "we randomly generate the number of charge particles @xmath24 and their @xmath25-distribution according to eqs .",
    "( [ gmc_nch ] ) and ( [ gmc_dndy ] ) , respectively .",
    "the construction of centrality classes can now be done in several ways . here",
    "we focus on the following criterions : via impact parameter @xmath8 , via the number of participating ( wounded ) nucleons @xmath13 , and via the charged particle multiplicity @xmath26 in the midrapidity window @xmath27 .    in the case one",
    "chooses the number of participating nucleons @xmath28 for centrality definition , one takes vertical cuts in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] ( _ left _ ) , while choosing the impact parameter @xmath8 , one takes horizontal cuts .",
    "hence , depending on the centrality definition , one may assign a particular event ( characterized by @xmath13 and @xmath8 ) to two different centrality bins .    in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] ( _ right _ ) we show the resulting scaled variance @xmath29 , @xmath30 of the underlying distribution of the number of participating nucleons @xmath13 in each centrality bin . using the centrality selection via impact parameter @xmath8 , which is only the theoretically available trigger ,",
    "one generally obtains a rather wide distribution of participating nucleons in each bin .",
    "the lines for centrality selections via @xmath26 and via @xmath13 are similar due to the event construction with eqs .",
    "( [ gmc_nch],[gmc_dndy ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the gmc model is that @xmath29 increases with centrality for the selection via @xmath13 .",
    "this conclusion of the gmc model seems to have a rather general origin .",
    "we now investigate the sensitivity of the forward - backward correlation signal as a function of the separation @xmath6 of two narrow intervals ( @xmath31 ) on the centrality definition .",
    "this is done for the 10% centrality defined via @xmath13 , via @xmath8 , and via @xmath26 .",
    "the results are shown in  fig .",
    "[ gmc_fb_corr ] .    in the gmc",
    "we can identify the number of participating nucleons @xmath13 with the system size , and @xmath29 as the measure for system size fluctuations . having a large system as measured by @xmath13",
    "implies a large number of charged particles @xmath24 . in gmc",
    "they are distributed independently in pseudo - rapidity space .",
    "conversely , an event with small @xmath13 contains only few charged particles .",
    "by grouping the collision events into 10% centrality bins one finds rather large @xmath28-fluctuations in one specific bin .",
    "the averaging over different states in the centrality bin introduces correlations between any two regions of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "small systems will have few particles ` on the left ' and few particles ` on the right ' with respect to midrapidity .",
    "large systems will have many particles ` on the left ' and many particles ` on the right ' .",
    "but this just means a non - zero forward - backward correlations . from the definition ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "one finds a positive correlation coefficient  @xmath12 due to averaging over system sizes .",
    "note that centrality selections via @xmath28 and via @xmath24 give essentially the same results for @xmath12 in the gmc ( cf .",
    "_ left _ and _ right _ panels of fig .",
    "[ gmc_fb_corr ] ) . using",
    "the impact parameter @xmath8 for the centrality definition generates centrality bins with almost constant @xmath12 as seen in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fb_corr ] ( _ middle _ ) .",
    "this is due to a rather flat dependence of @xmath29 on the centrality defined via @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] ( _ right _ ) . in the gmc model",
    "the apparent ordering of @xmath12 values with respect to centrality bins originates from the width of the underlying distribution in the number of wounded nucleons in each bin , i.e. from the values of @xmath32 .",
    "the measured and apparently strong forward - backward correlations can be accounted for by a ` toy ' model such as the gmc , provided it produces particles over the whole rapidity range and includes strong enough event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath28 .",
    "the next section will show that an introduction of dynamics and hadron re - interactions within the hsd does not alter these conclusions significantly .",
    "a physically more reasonable scenario , which however also does not include any ` new physics ' ( such as color glass condensate , quark - gluon plasma , etc . ) can be obtained in the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach @xcite .",
    "the hsd has been used for the description of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 collisions from sis to rhic energies @xcite . in this model , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , n@xmath38(1440 ) , n@xmath38(1535 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 hyperons , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 as well as their antiparticles are included on the baryonic side , whereas the @xmath45 and @xmath46 octet states are incorporated in the mesonic sector .",
    "inelastic baryon  baryon ( and meson  baryon ) collisions with energies above @xmath47  gev ( and @xmath48  gev ) are described by the fritiof string model @xcite whereas low energy hadron ",
    "hadron collisions are modelled in line with experimental cross sections . as pre - hadronic degrees of freedom",
    "the hsd includes ` effective ' quarks ( antiquarks ) and diquarks ( antidiquarks ) which interact with cross sections in accordance with the constituent quark model .    as before within gmc ,",
    "the hsd events are generated according to a uniform distribution , @xmath49 .",
    "the resulting distribution of events in the @xmath50-plane is similar to the gmc result depicted in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] ( _ left _ ) .    in fig .",
    "[ distr_npart ] we show the distribution of events with fixed @xmath13 for both models .",
    "the vertical lines indicate @xmath51 centrality bins as defined by the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "note , that the peripheral part of the distribution determines also the centrality binning and the real bin widths .",
    "this is crucial for most central collisions where the number of events is small .",
    "slight uncertainties in the peripheral `` tail '' of the distribution leads to large errors in the sizes of most central bins and hence to large changes in results for fluctuations and correlations .",
    "in contrast to the star data , we use in the hsd simulations the charged particle reference multiplicity @xmath26 in the same pseudo - rapidity range @xmath52 for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "this procedure introduces a systematic bias , since the pseudo - rapidity regions for the measured multiplicity in a small @xmath2 window ( signal ) and for the reference multiplicity partially overlap .",
    "this bias , however , is small and does not affect any of our conclusions .    in fig .",
    "[ hsd_fluc_npart ] we show the scaled variance of the underlying @xmath13 distribution for 10% ( _ left _ ) and 2% ( _ right _ ) centrality bins defined via different centrality triggers within hsd . the results for 10% bins can be compared with the scaled variance @xmath32 in the gmc model in fig .",
    "[ gmc_fluc_npart ] ( _ right _ ) .",
    "fluctuations of the number of participants , as well as their average values , are similar in both hsd and gmc models when the centrality bins are defined via @xmath13 .",
    "these quantities are completely defined by the @xmath13 distribution , which is similar in both models ( fig .",
    "[ distr_npart ] ) .",
    "binning via the impact parameter @xmath8 in hsd , as well as in gmc , gives decreasing fluctuations in the participant number with increasing collision centrality .",
    "the results for 10% bins defined via the reference multiplicity are rather different in the gmc and hsd models . in gmc",
    "the charged multiplicity distribution is implemented according to eqs .",
    "( [ gmc_nch],[gmc_dndy ] ) . hence , the results obtained by binning via the reference multiplicity follow the line obtained by binning via @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to the gmc , in the hsd simulations the average number of charged particles @xmath20 per participating nucleon is not a constant , but increases with @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , the shape of rapidity distribution is also different in different centrality bins .",
    "these two effects lead to different values of @xmath32 in the centrality bins defined via @xmath26 in the gmc and hsd models .",
    "one comment is appropriate here .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that any centrality selection in nucleus - nucleus collisions is equivalent to the geometrical one via impact parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by neglecting the fluctuations at a given value of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , different centrality selection criterions give indeed the same _ average _ values of physical observables .",
    "however , they may lead to rather different fluctuations of these observables in the corresponding centrality bins , cf .",
    "equal values of @xmath53 and different values of @xmath32 for different centrality selections presented in fig .",
    "[ hsd_fluc_npart ] .    when considering smaller centrality bins ( 2% in fig .",
    "[ hsd_fluc_npart ] , _ right _ ) the fluctuations in the participant number become smaller and more strongly dependent on the definition of the binning .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ hsd_fb_corr ] summarizes the dependence of forward - backward correlation coefficient @xmath12 as a function of @xmath6 on the bin size and centrality definition within the hsd model .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath6 is almost flat , reflecting a boost - invariant distribution of particles created by string breaking in the hsd .",
    "right top _",
    "panel of fig .",
    "[ hsd_fb_corr ] demonstrates also a comparison of the hsd results with the star data @xcite .",
    "one observes that the hsd results exceed systematically the star data .",
    "however , the main qualitative features of the star data  an approximate independence of the width of the pseudo - rapidity gap @xmath6 and a strong increase of @xmath12 with centrality  are fully reproduced by the hsd simulations .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath12 largely follows the trend of the participant number fluctuations @xmath32 as a function of centrality .",
    "the actual results , however , strongly depend on the way of defining the centrality bins .",
    "for instance , choosing smaller centrality bins leads to weaker forward - backward correlations , a less pronounced centrality dependence , and a stronger dependence on the bin definition .",
    "the physical origin for this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ hsd_npart_nref ] .",
    "as the bin size becomes comparable to the width of the correlation band between @xmath13 and @xmath26 , the systematic deviations of different centrality selections become dominant : the same centrality bins defined by @xmath28 and by @xmath26 contain different events and may give rather different values of forward - backward correlations coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "it should be underlined that these properties are specific to the _ geometric _ nature of the correlations analyzed here .",
    "if the observed fluctuations are of _ dynamical _ origin ( for example , arising from the quantum fluctuations of coherent fields created in the first @xmath54 of the system s lifetime as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , there are no evident reasons why they should strongly depend on centrality bin definitions and bin sizes .",
    "thus , the experimental analysis for different bin sizes and centrality definitions  as performed here  may serve as a diagnostic tool for an origin of the observed correlations .",
    "a strong specific dependence of the correlations on bin size and centrality definition would signify their geometrical origin .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a study of the system size event - by - event fluctuations causing the rapidity forward - backward correlations in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our analysis has been based on two independent models  a ` toy ' wounded nucleon model realized as a glauber monte carlo event generator and the microscopic hsd transport approach .",
    "we have shown that strong forward - backward correlations arise due to an averaging over many different events that belong to one 10% centrality bin .",
    "in contrast to average multiplicities , the resulting fluctuations and correlations depend strongly on the specific centrality trigger .",
    "for example , the centrality selection via impact parameter @xmath8 used in most theoretical calculations and via @xmath26 used experimentally lead to rather different values of @xmath32 and @xmath12 and their dependence on centrality .    in the hsd model",
    "the @xmath28 distribution is similar to that in the gmc .",
    "it includes also the fluctuations in the number of strings and the fluctuations in the number of hadrons from individual string fragmentation .",
    "the hsd simulations reveal strong forward - backward correlations and reproduce the main qualitative features of the star data in a+a collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the forward - backward correlations can be studied experimentally for smaller size centrality bins defined by @xmath26 .",
    "when the size of the bins decreases , the contribution of ` geometrical ' fluctuations discussed in our paper should lead to weaker forward - backward correlations and to a less pronounced centrality dependence .",
    "let us stress that the ` geometrical ' fluctuations discussed in our paper are in fact present in all dynamical models of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "thus , they should be carefully subtracted from the data before any discussion of new physical effects .",
    "we hope that a future experimental analysis in the direction examined here will clarify wether the observed correlations by the star collaboration at rhic contain really additional contributions from ` new physics ' .",
