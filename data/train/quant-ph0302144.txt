    "entanglement is a fundamental concept in the theory of quantum information , and the essential resource for ( potential ) modern applications of quantum mechanics @xcite . as the cause of nonclassical correlations between measurement results on the different constituents of multipartite quantum systems it is the key ingredient for quantum cryptography , teleportation , and quantum computing .",
    "however , the quantitative characterization of entanglement remains a largely open problem , due to the ever more intricate topology and rapidly increasing dimension of the space of admissible quantum states with the number of components of composite quantum systems . by now , only the entanglement of pure bipartite states is well understood and unambiguously quantified @xcite . for mixed states  which we generically encounter in nature  a large variety of entanglement measures was proposed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "almost none of them , however , can be computed efficiently , the only exceptions ( to our knowledge ) being the _ negativity _",
    "@xcite , and the _ entanglement of formation _ @xcite of two qubits @xcite .",
    "for instance , to calculate the entanglement of formation in higher dimensional spaces , one needs to perform a complicated optimization procedure over the huge space of all possible decompositions of the analyzed mixed state @xmath2 into pure states , such as to minimize the average pure state entanglement needed to represent @xmath2 . by construction",
    ", such a procedure can only provide an upper bound for the degree of entanglement of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "what is needed in addition is a lower bound of mixed state entanglement , which we shall provide for @xmath3 systems in the present contribution .",
    "to do so , we will use the _ concurrence _ , originally introduced by wootters @xcite for @xmath4 states , and generalized for any bipartite pure states by rungta _ et al .",
    "( alternative generalizations were proposed in @xcite . )",
    "we shall generalize its definition for general @xmath0 mixed states and derive an analytical lower bound which also implies a lower bound for the entanglement of formation .",
    "for some class of @xmath1 mixed states we can establish equality between our lower bound and the exact value of the concurrence , and numerical calculations assess the tightness of our bound for general @xmath1 mixed states .",
    "let us start with the definition of the concurrence of a pure state on a @xmath5 dimensional hilbert space @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we first need the _ flip operator _",
    "acting on an arbitrary hermitian operator @xmath8 on @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the identity on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) the partial trace over @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . @xmath7",
    "commutes with all unitary operators and preserves positivity .",
    "moreover , the expectation value @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , is non - negative for all pure states and equals zero if and only if @xmath21 is a product state . this allows to define the concurrence of any arbitrary bipartite pure state as @xcite @xmath22 wherefrom @xmath23 } \\label{concge2}\\ ] ] is easily deduced , with @xmath24 the reduced density operator of dimension @xmath25 .",
    "observe that @xmath26 is linear in the norm of @xmath27 .",
    "for a normalized state , @xmath28 , it interpolates monotonously between zero for product states , and @xmath29 for maximally entangled states , where @xmath30 is assumed ( without loss of generality ) .",
    "we now need the generalization of this definition for mixed states . as a consequence of the generalized construction outlined in @xcite , any entanglement measure on the pure states",
    "can be ported to the mixed states through minimization of its average value on all possible decompositions into pure states .",
    "for instance , the _ entanglement of formation _ @xmath31 of a mixed state is defined @xcite as the infimum over all possible pure state decompositions @xmath32 with @xmath33 the _ entropy of entanglement_. the length of the ensemble @xmath34 is arbitrary , but need not exceed @xmath35 @xcite . in close analogy , we define the mixed state concurrence as @xmath36    note that , in the simplest case of @xmath37 systems , the infima in ( [ eof ] ) and ( [ concge3 ] ) can be realized simultaneously , by the same optimal decomposition , and the definition ( [ concge3 ] ) thus reduces to the original one @xcite . however , in the general case of @xmath5 systems the minimum average entropy of entanglement need not be achieved with the same ( optimal ) decomposition as the minimum average concurrence  @xcite .    to derive an lower bound of @xmath38 from below ,",
    "we now specialize to the case @xmath39 .",
    "if a @xmath0 state is pure , its concurrence may be expressed in terms of unnormalized states @xmath40 , which live on a @xmath37 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath41 be an arbitrary basis of @xmath13 , and @xmath42 denote the projections onto @xmath37 dimensional subspaces .",
    "we then obtain the squared concurrence of a @xmath0 pure state directly from the definition ( [ concgen ] ) : @xmath43 given this expression , we can derive the desired lower bound . according to ( [ concge3 ] ) , @xmath44 for the _ optimal decomposition _ @xmath45 .",
    "insertion of ( [ 2kto22pure ] ) yields @xmath46 where we introduced arbitrary coefficients @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "next , we use the concavity of the square root and obtain : @xmath49 the sum over @xmath50 on the right hand side can be interpreted as the average concurrence @xmath51 of the @xmath37 density matrices @xmath52 obtained by projections @xmath53 due to the definition ( [ concgen ] ) , @xmath51 can not be smaller than the projected concurrence @xmath54 , which is known analytically as the concurrence of a @xmath37 mixed state .",
    "hence , @xmath55 since the @xmath56 were not fixed in ( [ concave1 ] ) , we still can choose these coefficients @xmath56 such as to maximize the sum on the right hand side of ( [ ineqc1 ] ) , @xmath57 and arrive at @xmath58 this lower bound still depends on the choice of the basis @xmath59 , of the @xmath60 dimensional subsystem . to find the tightest lower bound , we have to maximize ( [ lowerbound ] ) over all orthogonal basis sets , tantamount to finding the unitary @xmath61 operator @xmath62 which transforms to the optimal basis @xmath63 .",
    "note that such a search is much faster than finding the optimal decomposition of the mixed state via a suitable unitary transformation of dimension @xmath64 .",
    "finally , since the entropy of entanglement of a pure state on @xmath3 systems is a convex function of its concurrence @xcite , @xmath65 the inequality ( [ lowerbound ] ) immediately provides a lower bound for the entanglement of formation defined in ( [ eof ] ) : @xmath66\\ ,     .\\ ] ] as a matter of fact , the same bound was equally proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , the proof in @xcite is invalid , since it relies on the incorrect assumption that the entanglement of formation is a convex function of the _ squared _ concurrence @xmath67 .    given the above estimate , we shall now assess its tightness for the special case @xmath68 .",
    "in this case , ( [ lowerbound ] ) allows to distinguish between entangled and separable states , since any entangled @xmath1 state also has entangled projections onto @xmath37 subspaces .",
    "( this is not the case for @xmath69 , due to the existence of bound entangled states with positive partial transpose @xcite . )",
    "our random mixed states were generated by partial trace @xmath70 over pure states @xmath71 randomly drawn ( with respect to the natural fubini ",
    "study measure @xcite ) from a @xmath72 dimensional state space , with @xmath73 .",
    "the larger the dimension @xmath74 , the more mixed is @xmath75 , hence the smaller its concurrence .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath76 , the @xmath77 ensemble contains only states which do not have full rank . fig .",
    "[ ublbfig ] compares the lower bound ( [ lowerbound ] ) of the concurrence of the random states drawn from these three ensembles to its upper bound , which is obtained as the average concurrence with respect to a particular ( numerically optimized ) decomposition of the state @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , our lower bound comes very close to the upper bound , for the entire range from strongly entangled to almost separable states .    in many cases , in particular for all the relatively weakly entangled states drawn from the @xmath78 ensemble , we have even found exact agreement of the lower and the upper bound of the concurrence",
    "all these states , which are marked by dots in fig .",
    "[ ublbfig ] , fulfill the property that there is only one entangled substate among the three ( optimal ) @xmath37 substates , i.e. , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "let us examine closer under which conditions an exact agreement of upper and lower bound may then be expected : if we reexamine ( [ concave1 ] ) and ( [ concave2 ] ) above , with the specific choice @xmath81 and @xmath82 according to ( [ weights ] ) , we conclude that the lower bound in ( [ concave2 ] ) can only be exact if all the states @xmath83 and @xmath84 are product states .",
    "if so , @xmath85 is either a product state , or @xmath86 lies in the image of @xmath87 . in other words ,",
    "_ any _ entangled @xmath86 in an optimal decomposition lies in the image of @xmath87 . since for any @xmath37 state there exists an optimal decomposition consisting of one entangled pure state and a separable remainder ( this follows from the derivation presented in @xcite ) , it follows that there exists an optimal decomposition of the @xmath1 state @xmath2 consisting of only _",
    "one _ entangled pure state .",
    "this suggests the following procedure to test whether the lower bound ( [ lowerbound ] ) is saturated : if there is only one entangled @xmath37 substate @xmath88 among the three @xmath52 s , we try to find a pure state @xmath27 with concurrence @xmath89 , such that @xmath90 is positive and separable .",
    "if this succeeds , we have found the exact value of the concurrence of @xmath2 .",
    "the dots ( @xmath91 ) in fig .",
    "[ ublbfig ] , where lower and upper bound coincide , have been obtained in this way .    for those mixed states for which at least two of the @xmath37 states @xmath52 are entangled , and equally so for some with only one entangled projection @xmath52 ( in particular for the low rank states of the @xmath77 ensemble ) , the lower and upper bound of the concurrence differ , although the difference is small in most cases .",
    "since it is numerically quite expensive to obtain a good value of the upper bound ( and there is no guarantee that the numerically found local minimum is also the global one ) , the actual value of the concurrence may be even closer to the lower bound .    to give an explicit example for which our lower bound can be proved to yield the exact value of the concurrence , we use the standard product basis , @xmath92 , to define the following family of states : @xmath93 for @xmath94 , these states may be considered as generalized werner states @xcite . by projection onto the subspace @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96 on the other hand , the state @xmath97 is positive and separable , provided that @xmath98 thereby , we have established @xmath99 in this parameter regime . ( if @xmath100 , which is the case for @xmath101 , the state @xmath102 is separable , i.e. , @xmath103 . )    as the simplest case which violates condition ( [ para ] ) , let us finally consider @xmath104 . according to ( [ 2kto22pure ] ) , the concurrence of an arbitrary superposition @xmath105 of the states @xmath106 and @xmath107 reads @xmath108 .",
    "the minimum @xmath109 is realized by the two states @xmath110 , which therefore form the optimal decomposition of @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we have shown that @xmath112 .",
    "on the other hand , the lower bound ( [ lowerbound ] ) , obtained by using the optimal basis @xmath113 yields @xmath114 .",
    "this proves that we can not expect the lower bound to be exact in all cases .",
    "we conjecture that the above example with @xmath104 realizes the largest possible difference between the lower bound and the actual value of the concurrence .",
    "in summary , combining the upper bound which follows from the very definition of mixed state concurrence with our analytical lower bound provides a tight estimation of its exact value , for arbitrary @xmath115 mixed states .",
    "furthermore , our lower bound can be efficiently evaluated , since it involves an optimization problem on a @xmath60-dimensional rather than on a @xmath64-dimensional space .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank marek ku and florian mintert for valuable remarks and entertaining discussions , as well as r.r  tucci for a fruitful correspondence .",
