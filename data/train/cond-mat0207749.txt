    "we find that , even with what is ordinarily considered weak intensity bragg pulses , processes that are higher than first order ( linear response ) play a role in the excitation process .",

    "the optical potential by a factor of 0.3 from the low intensity case to @xmath107 ( the curve labeled ultralow ) , new features in the spectrum become clear .",
    "the small feature near @xmath108 s@xmath83 and the tail of the bogoliubov peak at 2411 s@xmath83 , which was presumably due to an inhomogeneous density effect , become two ancillary peaks .",
    "the reason for the structure in the spectrum for the ultralow ( and low ) intensity can be understood by looking at @xmath87 vs.  @xmath88 for this case as shown in fig .",
