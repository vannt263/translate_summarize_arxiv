    "relativistic nuclear collisions can produce matter in which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "one possible consequence of this restoration is the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc )  transient regions in which the average chiral order parameter differs from its value in the surrounding vacuum .",
    "previous efforts to describe dcc signals have focused on pion production . in ref .",
    "@xcite , gavin and kapusta explored the possible influence of dcc on kaon production , inspired by an explanation by kapusta and wong @xcite of measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryon enhancement at the cern sps , as discussed by wong in these proceedings .    if true , ref .",
    "@xcite implies that the evolution of the condensate has a substantial strange component and , therefore , can produce kaon isospin fluctuations .",
    "a further implication is that the dcc regions must be rather small , with a size of about @xmath3  fm , in accord with predictions based on dynamical simulations of the two flavor linear sigma model .",
    "such a size is consistent with wa98 results reported here , which reveal no evidence of large dcc domains in neutral and charged pions . in this",
    "talk we study kaon isospin fluctuations in the presence of many small dcc ; both kaon and pion fluctuations were addressed in @xcite . in the next section",
    "we discuss how dcc may lead to kaon fluctuations and propose statistical observables to detect them . in sec .",
    "3 we present work in progress on event generator simulations to understand the magnitude and centrality dependence of these observables in the absence of dcc .",
    "to illustrate how a strange dcc can form , we first consider qcd with only up and down quark flavors .",
    "equilibrium high temperature qcd respects chiral symmetry if the quarks are taken to be massless .",
    "this symmetry is broken below @xmath4  mev by the formation of a chiral condensate @xmath5 that is a scalar isopin singlet .",
    "however , chiral symmetry implies that @xmath5 is degenerate with a pseudoscalar isospin triplet of fields with the same quantum numbers as the pions .",
    "dcc can form when a heavy ion collision produces a high energy density quark - gluon system that then rapidly expands and cools through the critical temperature .",
    "such a system can initially break chiral symmetry along one of the pion directions , but must then evolve to the @xmath6 vacuum by radiating pions .",
    "a single coherent dcc radiates a fraction @xmath7 of neutral pions that satisfies the probability distribution @xmath8 .",
    "such isospin fluctuations constitute the primary signal for dcc formation in the pion sector .",
    "the enhancement of baryon - antibaryon pair production in @xcite is a secondary effect due to the relation between baryon number and the topology of the pion condensate field .",
    "this two flavor idealization only applies if the strange quark mass @xmath9 can be taken to be infinite .",
    "alternatively , if we take @xmath10 , then the chiral condensate would be an up - down - strange symmetric scalar field .",
    "for a realistic @xmath9 , a disoriented condensate can evolve by radiating @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "kaon fluctuations from a single large dcc would satisfy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the condensate fluctuations can now produce strange baryon pairs @xcite .",
    "linear sigma model simulations indicate that pion fluctuations dominate three - flavor dcc behavior , while the fraction of energy imparted to kaon fluctuations is very small due to the kaons larger mass . on the other hand ,",
    "domain formation may be induced by other mechanisms such as bubble formation or decay of the polyakov loop condensate @xcite .",
    "detection of small incoherent dcc regions in high energy heavy ion collisions requires a statistical analysis in the @xmath15 or the @xmath0 channels .",
    "neutral mesons can be detected by the decays @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the analysis we propose in @xcite is sensitive to correlations due to isospin fluctuations .",
    "we expect these correlations to vary when dcc regions increase in abundance or size as centrality .",
    "correlations of @xmath18 are reflected in the isospin variance , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number of neutral and charged mesons . for a single dcc ,",
    "we find @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , an uncorrelated thermal source yields @xmath23 with @xmath24 . the dynamic isospin observable @xcite @xmath25 is convenient for experimenters , because this quantity is independent of detection efficiency @xcite as discussed in pruneau s talk .",
    "robust observables are useful for dcc studies because charged and neutral particles are identified using very different techniques and , consequently , are detected with different efficiency .    why does the dcc s size matter ?",
    "searches for structure in individual events  as conducted by wa98  can distinguish dcc isospin fluctuations from a thermal background only if the disoriented region is sufficiently large .",
    "dcc can then be the dominant source of pions at low transverse momenta , since @xmath26 for a coherent region of size @xmath27 .",
    "experiments focusing on low @xmath28 can then find anomalous events . for small domains as inferred in @xcite ,",
    "this event structure is hard to distinguish from conventional fluctuations .",
    "however , statistical observables such as ( 3 ) can signal even a small dcc contribution for a sufficiently large event sample .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compute the exact distribution of kaons due to many small dcc regions . for @xmath29 domains , this distribution tends toward a gaussian of mean @xmath30 and isospin variance @xmath31 . in a nuclear collision ,",
    "the best we can hope is that a fraction @xmath32 of kaons come from the decay or realignment of dcc domains , with the remainder @xmath33 from thermal sources .",
    "folding together the thermal and the @xmath34-dcc distributions , we find @xmath35 , which implies @xmath36 this quantity can be positive or negative depending on the magnitude of @xmath32 compared to the number of domains per kaon .",
    "we now discuss work in progress using event generators to simulate conventional sources of kaon fluctuations . in the absence of dcc , @xmath37 so that @xmath38 , see eq .",
    "the other hand , incomplete equilibration in nuclear collisions can result in dynamical correlations not described above . in particular , correlations at the @xmath39 level can affect @xmath40 . to explore",
    "how this might occur , we use hijing and urqmd to estimate the influence of conventional collision geometry and dynamics on the centrality dependence .        to establish the relevance of these models ,",
    "we show in fig .  1 the dynamic _ charge _ fluctuations @xmath42 for pions and kaons as functions of the number of participants @xmath43 computed from 300,000 hijing , hijing/@xmath44 and 50,000 urqmd events for au+au at 200 a@xmath45 in the rapidity range @xmath46 .",
    "the uncertainties shown are statistical .",
    "observe that all models give nearly the same values of @xmath42 .",
    "star data in pruneau s talk in these proceedings is in reasonable agreement with this data .",
    "figure 2 ( left ) shows the dynamic isospin observable as a function of @xmath43 from hijing , hijing/@xmath44 and urqmd .",
    "the large disagreement between the hijing variants and urqmd is astonishing , given the similarity of the charge fluctuations . to understand the contribution of collision dynamics to @xmath47",
    ", we compare our simulations to the wounded nucleon model ( wnm ) .",
    "this model implies @xmath48 , where @xmath43 is the number of participants .",
    "the value in pp collisions @xmath49 is determined from pp simulations .",
    "the wnm curves in fig .",
    "2 agree with hijing and hijing/@xmath44 ( the upper sets of points ) , but disagree with central urqmd ( the lower points ) .",
    "these trends may stem from the inclusion of rescattering in urqmd but not in hijing .        to illustrate the possible scenario for the onset of dcc effects",
    ", we estimate @xmath52 by adding dcc and wounded - nucleon contributions to the kaon variance and using ( 3 ) to find @xmath53 .",
    "we assume that the fraction of dcc kaons @xmath32 exhibits a threshold behavior above an impact parameter @xmath54 , @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath54 and @xmath56 are ad hoc constants . in fig .  2 ,",
    "we show estimates assuming that 10 domains contribute kaons in the range @xmath57 for @xmath58  fm , taking the dcc fraction @xmath59 .    in summary , we have argued that measurements of @xmath60 correlations may probe a variety of interesting phenomena , especially 2 + 1 flavor dcc .",
    "the robust statistical variable @xmath61 is sensitive to dcc even if domains are small . in addition , we have estimated @xmath61 in the absence of dcc using hijing and urqmd event generators .",
    "we find that isospin fluctuations distinguish between these models , while charge fluctuations do not ."
