    "the remarkable experimental achievements ( for some recent examples see refs . ) relating to neutrino oscillations @xcite have brought much closer to reality the goal of determining the  light \" neutrino masses and the presumed 3 @xmath4 3 lepton mixing matrix .",
    "it is possible that more than three light neutrinos are required in order to understand the results of the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "however , we consider it reasonable , before deciding on this , to wait for further supporting evidence as should be supplied soon by the miniboone collaboration @xcite .",
    "the mixing matrix contains three mixing angles and , if the neutrinos are considered to be dirac type fermions , a single cp violation phase .",
    "that would be completely analogous to the situation prevailing in the quark sector of the electroweak theory .",
    "but it seems very interesting to consider the possibility that the three light neutrinos are majorana type fermions .",
    "this involves only half as many fermionic degrees of freedom and would be mandated if neutrinoless double beta decay were to be conclusively established .",
    "the majorana neutrino scenario implies the existence of two additional cp violation phases . then",
    "nine quantities ( beyond the charged lepton masses ) would be required for the specification of the lepton sector : three neutrino masses , three mixing angles and three cp violation phases .    according to a recent analysis @xcite it is possible to extract from the data to good accuracy , two squared neutrino mass differences : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and two inter - generational mixing angle squared sines : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore the inter - generational mixing parameter @xmath9 is found to be very small .",
    "thus 5 out of 9 quantities needed to describe the leptonic sector in the majorana neutrino scenario can be considered as  known \" . for many purposes",
    "it is desirable to get an idea of the remaining 4 parameters . as an aid in partially determining the other parameters ,",
    "a so - called  complementary ansatz \" was proposed @xcite .",
    "the name arises from the fact that if cp violation is neglected , the ansatz determines ( up to two different cases ) all three neutrino masses , given the two known squared mass differences .",
    "this complementary ansatz simply reads , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the symmetric , but in general complex , prediagonal majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it is brought to diagonal form by the transformation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a unitary matrix and the @xmath14 may be chosen as real , positive .",
    "we impose the condition in a basis where the charged leptons are diagonal so that u gets identified with the lepton mixing matrix .    since eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) comprises two real equations , it gives two conditions on the unknown 4 parameters of the lepton sector .",
    "in other words , the lepton sector is described by a two parameter family of solutions .",
    "this can be approximately simplified @xcite by noting that the effects of one cp violation phase get suppressed when the small quantity @xmath15 vanishes .",
    "then there is a one parameter family of solutions describing the lepton sector and it is straightforward to compute physical quantities for parameter choices which span this family .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to find the general solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) without making this approximation .",
    "this gives a two parameter family which allows one to study the interplay of all three cp violation phases .",
    "a plausibility argument supporting the complementary ansatz is concisely presented in sections 2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "it is based on using the so(10 ) grand unification group in the approximation that the non - seesaw neutrino mass term dominates .",
    "the higgs fields which can contribute to fermion masses at tree level are the * 10 * , * 120 * and the * 126*. if only a single * 126 * appears ( but any number of the others ) one has the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the prediagonal mass matrices of the charge -1/3 quarks and charge -1 leptons , while @xmath19 3 takes account of running masses from the grand unified scale to about 1 gev .",
    "now one of the major surprises generated by the neutrino oscillation experiments is that , unlike the quark mixing matrix which has the form diag ( 1,1,1 ) + o@xmath20 , the lepton mixing matrix is not at all close to the unit matrix .",
    "this suggests a further approximation in which one takes @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be diagonal but allows the neutrino mass matrix to be far from the unit matrix .",
    "then the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ so10 ] ) is approximately @xmath21 , which is in turn close to zero .",
    "as we will see , the model makes a number of characteristic predictions for the neutrino mass spectrum which should enable it to be readily tested in the near future .",
    "a very recent review of many other models is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for convenience , our notation ( essentially the standard one ) for the lepton mixing matrix and the corresponding parameterized ansatz",
    "is given in section ii .",
    "in section iii the ansatz is solved in the sense of providing a geometrical algorithm which , given the two input quantities @xmath1 ( third neutrino mass , taken positive ) and @xmath2 ( conventional cp violation phase in the lepton mixing matrix ) , enables one to predict the other two neutrino masses as well as the other two cp violation phases . of course , the experimental knowledge on the neutrino squared mass differences and cp conserving intergenerational mixing angles are taken to be  known \" .",
    "we separate the solutions into two types i and ii , depending respectively on whether @xmath1 is the largest or the smallest of the neutrino masses . in addition , there is a discrete ambiguity corresponding to reflecting a triangle involved in the algorithm . a  panoramic \" view of the predictions as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are presented in a convenient tabular form .",
    "the greatest allowed value of @xmath1 is determined by a cosmology bound .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , a point is reached at which the type i solutions no longer exist .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases even further , the type ii solutions also cease to exist .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath1 at which these solutions become disallowed depend on the assumed value of the input @xmath2 .",
    "this correlation is studied analytically .",
    "some physical considerations are discussed in section iv .",
    "first , the dependence on the experimentally bounded squared mixing angle , @xmath9 is investigated .",
    "we present also a chart showing the dependence of the neutrinoless double beta decay parameter @xmath22 on the input parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "even though the inputs are varying over a fairly large range , the rather restrictive approximate bounded range 0.020 ev @xmath3 0.185 ev emerges from the ansatz .",
    "after calculating observable quantities in the model one observes that they depend more simply on certain linear combinations of the conventional  dirac \" and  majorana \" cp violation phases . in section",
    "v we discuss an alternative parameterization of the lepton mixing matrix in which these combinations occur directly . in this parameterization",
    "the three phases just correspond to the three possible intergenerational mixings .",
    "an  invariant \" combination of these three corresponds to the usual  dirac \" phase @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude in section vi which contains a brief summary and a discussion of results which emphasize some unique features of the present work .",
    "we define the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath23 from the charged gauge boson interaction term in the leptonic sector of the electroweak lagrangian : @xmath24 note that the  mass diagonal \" neutrino fields , @xmath25 are related to the fields , @xmath26 in the prediagonal mass basis by the matrix equation , @xmath27 we adopt essentially what seems to be the most common parameterization : @xmath28 where a unimodular diagonal matrix of phases is defined as , @xmath29 the remaining factor , @xmath30 which is the only part needed for describing ordinary neutrino oscillations is written as the product of three successive two dimensional unitary transformations , @xmath31 with three mixing angles and the cp violation phase @xmath2 .",

    "\\label{paramansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this equation we can choose the diagonal masses @xmath37 to be real positive .",
    "notice that setting the mixing parameter @xmath15 to zero eliminates the dependence on the cp violation phase @xmath2",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ paramansatz ] ) goes over to the simpler form studied previously @xcite .",
    "for definiteness we will use the following best fit values for the differences of squared neutrino masses obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath38 the uncertainty in these determinations is roughly @xmath39 . similarly for definiteness we will adopt the best fit values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained in the same analysis : @xmath40 these mixing angles also have about a @xmath39 uncertainty .",
    "the experimental status of @xmath9 is less accurately known . at present",
    "only the 3 @xmath41 bound , @xmath42 is available . for our discussion",
    "we will consider @xmath9 to be known at a  typical \" value satisfying this bound and examine the sensitivity to changing it .",
    "of course , the experimental determination of @xmath15 is a topic of great current interest .",
    "previously@xcite , the ( positive ) mass of the third neutrino , @xmath1 was considered to be the free parameter .",
    "it was varied to obtain , via the simplified ansatz equation , a  panoramic view \" of the two independent majorana phases ( say @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . in the present case",
    ", we shall not neglect the cp violation phase @xmath2 and consider it too as a free parameter to be varied .",
    "it is necessary to specify a suitable algorithm to treat the full ansatz .",
    "previously it was noted that the simplified ansatz could be pictured as a vector triangle in the complex plane having sides equal to corresponding neutrino masses ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the three internal angles were found by trigonometry and related to the three angles made by the sides with respect to the positive real axis .",
    "those in turn were twice the three ( constrained ) majorana phases .",
    "the orientation of the triangle got determined ( up to a reflection ) by the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ majoranaphases ] ) . in the present case",
    "we will also rewrite the ansatz equation as a vector triangle in the complex plane .",
    "however the sides will differ from the neutrino masses .",
    "in addition the angles will differ from twice the constrained majorana phases .    to start , we choose a value for @xmath1 and a value for the phase @xmath2 .",
    "then we can obtain from eqs.([massdifferences ] ) two different solutions for the other masses @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we call the solution where @xmath1 is the largest neutrino mass , the type i case .",
    "the case where @xmath1 is the smallest neutrino mass is designated type ii .",
    "@xmath45 will be determined from the assumed value of @xmath1 as , @xmath47 where the upper and lower sign choices respectively refer to the type i and type ii cases . in either case",
    "we find @xmath46 as , @xmath48 .",
    "next , we redefine variables so that each of the three terms in the ansatz equation , ( [ paramansatz ] ) is characterized by a single magnitude , @xmath49 and a single phase , @xmath50 .",
    "( [ paramansatz ] ) then reads , @xmath51 this equation evidently represents a vector triangle in the complex plane , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "however the lengths are not the physical neutrino masses and the phases are not twice the physical majorana cp violation phases .",

    "1 we can determine the internal angles , @xmath58 by using the law of cosines .",
    "for example , @xmath59 next , the auxiliary phases @xmath57 can be related to the internal angles just obtained as : @xmath60 the remaining still unknown parameter here is @xmath61 which we added to the right hand side of each equation .",
    "it represents the effect of an arbitrary rotation of the whole triangle , which should not be determinable from the internal angles . it can be determined , however , by making use of the constraint on the physical phases , @xmath62 .",
    "notice that there is no corresponding constraint for @xmath63 . using eq .",
    "( [ findtaui ] ) we get , @xmath64 where the @xmath65 are to be read from eqs .",

    "now the masses @xmath66 and the phases @xmath67 have been determined by a simple algorithm , upon specification of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "as remarked above , the dependence on the cp violation phase @xmath2 is suppressed in the limit that the mixing parameter @xmath9 vanishes .",
    "hence , to illustrate this new feature , we will consider a value @xmath9 = 0.04 , close to the 3@xmath41 upper bound of 0.047 @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the neutrino masses @xmath68 and two independent phases @xmath69 , from the ansatz for various assumed values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given in table [ trianglesampler ] .",

    "this is true also for higher values of @xmath1 .",

    "( [ cosmobound ] ) and might be improved upon .",
    "we also note that , when both type i and type ii solutions exist for a given value of @xmath1 , the type ii solution gives somewhat larger @xmath22 .",
    "the main dependence of @xmath22 is , of course , on the input parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we plan to discuss elsewhere other physical applications including beta decay end point spectra @xcite and leptogenesis @xcite using the approach of ref . @xcite .",
    "in the parameterization of the leptonic mixing matrix given by eq.([fullmixingmatrix ] ) , which is similar to the one usually adopted , there appears to be an important distinction between the phase @xmath2 and the phases @xmath56 in the sense that only @xmath2 survives when one considers the ordinary ( overall lepton number conserving ) neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "however , this distinction may be preserved in a different way while using a more symmetrical parameterization .",
    "thus consider , @xmath76 which contains the same mixing angles , @xmath77 as before but now has the three associated cp violation phases , @xmath78 .",

    "now choose the @xmath56 s ( two are independent ) so that the transformed ( 12 ) and ( 23 ) phases vanish .",
    "then , with the identifications , @xmath83 we notice that @xmath84 is related to @xmath23 of eq .",

    "( [ weakinteraction ] ) with the charged lepton field row vector on its left , all physical results will be unchanged if @xmath23 is multiplied by a diagonal matrix of phases on its left .",
    "thus @xmath23 and @xmath84 are equivalent and the relations between the cp violation phases of the two parameterizatons are given by eq .",

    "it has the desired property of intrinsically spanning three generations , as needed for cp violation in ordinary neutrino oscillation or in the quark mixing analog .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen @xcite to have an interesting mathematical structure and to be useful for extension to the case where there are more than three generations of fermions    the convenience of the symmetrical parameterization can already be seen in eqs .",

    "simplify when one observes that the combinations of phases occurring within them are simply @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "these are evidently the two phases which describe the coupling of the first lepton generation .",
    "similarly , the estimates of cp violation needed for the treatment of leptogenesis made in section v of @xcite also simplify when expressed in terms of the @xmath78 .",
    "assuming that the squared neutrino mass differences and the three ( cp conserving ) lepton mixing angles are known , the mass of one neutrino and three cp violation phases remain to be determined .",
    "the complementary ansatz , @xmath90 = 0 , provides two real conditions on the parameters of the lepton system . here , we took @xmath1 and @xmath2 as input parameters and then determined the other two masses and the other two cp violation phases according to this ansatz .",
    "a geometric algorithm was presented based on a modification of an earlier treatment @xcite in which the dirac cp violation phase @xmath2 was neglected , but the other two majorana type cp violation phases were retained .",
    "that is a reasonable first approximation because the effect of delta is always suppressed by @xmath15 which is known experimentally to be small .",
    "however , there is great interest in the determination of @xmath2 so it should not be ignored .",
    "additionally in ref . @xcite it was suggested that small cp violation scenarios might be close to the physical case .",
    "the present algorithm is exact and does not require the assumption that any parameters are small .",
    "the ansatz yields a characteristic pattern for the neutrino masses and the cp violation phases . because @xmath9 is small ,",
    "the main cause of change is the assumed value of the input parameter @xmath1 .",
    "first one notes that the small experimental value of a in eq .",
    "( [ massdifferences ] ) always forces the neutrino 1 and neutrino 2 masses to be almost degenerate ( see table [ trianglesampler ] ) . for the largest allowed ( from the cosmological bound eq .",
    "( [ cosmobound ] ) ) value of @xmath1 , around 0.3 ev , there is an approximate three - fold degeneracy of all the neutrino masses .",
    "this is understandable since when the mass scale becomes large , both a and b can be considered negligible",
    ". then the triangle of fig .",
    "1 becomes approximately equilateral .",
    "the internal angles of the triangle approximately measure the strength of the cp phases @xmath91 and are clearly large in this situation .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , a point around 0.06 ev is reached at which the type i solutions ( @xmath1 largest ) no longer exist . at this point the cp violation vanishes for the @xmath2 = 0 case and becomes small when @xmath920 .",
    "also at this point the almost degenerate neutrino 1 and neutrino 2 masses decrease to about half the neutrino 3 mass in the type i case . in the present model neutrinos 1 and 2 never go below about half the mass of neutrino 3 .",
    "the situation is a little different for the type ii cases ( @xmath1 smallest ) .",
    "the type ii solutions exist from a maximum of @xmath1 about 0.3 ev to a minimum of about 0.001 ev . at the minimum the cp violation ceases for @xmath2 = 0 and has small effects when @xmath92 0 .",
    "furthermore , at the minimum neutrinos 1 and 2 are about 50 times heavier than neutrino 3 .",
    "thus a possible hierarchy of neutrino masses can only exist in one way for the present model , with @xmath1 considerably smaller than the other two .",
    "some further technical details of the model were displayed in tables ii -iv .",
    "these describe the @xmath2 dependence of the limiting values of the input parameter @xmath1 just mentioned , the solution corrresponding to a reflected triangle and the effect of varying @xmath9",
    ".    the model might be handy for getting an idea about the range of predictions for various leptonic phenomena , since it gives a plausible two parameter complete set of neutrino masses , mixing angles and cp violation phases .",
    "for example , in section v an application is made to the quantity @xmath22 which characterizes neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the results for about the largest allowed @xmath9 , the reflected solution and a smaller @xmath9 choice are shown in tables vi , vii and viii .",
    "it may be noted that the solutions vary rather smoothly with @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a solution of given type .",
    "thus , even though one might initially expect the result of allowing a two parameter family choice to be rather weak , it turns out that one gets fairly restrictive upper and lower bounds on @xmath22 as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ meebounds ] ) .",
    "these approximate bounds may be considered also as a test of the present model .",
    "of course , any direct determination of a neutrino mass , say from a beta decay endpoint experiment , will also provide a test of the model .    in section v we took up a question which is independent of the present ansatz .",
    "how should one parameterize the lepton mixing matrix ?",
    "of course , this is fundamentally a question of choice .",
    "however , we notice in the present work that the physical quantities we calculate , depend in the simplest way not on the conventional phases @xmath2 and @xmath56 ( where @xmath93 ) but on the quantities @xmath78 given in eq .",
    "( [ relatingphases ] ) .",
    "such a dependence arises naturally if one uses the alternative mixing matrix parameterization given by @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ sympar ] ) . this may be understood physically in the following way .",
    "the @xmath78 s by definition ( see eq.([onetwotransf ] ) for example ) span two generations .",

    "this takes care of the two majorana phases . when @xmath94 the three @xmath78 s are of course independent and the  invariant phase `` combination @xmath95 discussed some time ago @xcite intrinsically spans three generations , as expected for ' ' dirac \" type cp violation",
