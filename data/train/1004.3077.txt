    "<S> a phenomenological law , called benford s law , states that the occurrence of the first digit , i.e. , @xmath0 , of numbers from many real world sources is not uniformly distributed , but instead favors smaller ones according to a logarithmic distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , for the first time , the first digit distribution of the full widths of mesons and baryons in the well defined science domain of particle physics systematically , and find that they agree excellently with the benford distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss several general properties of benford s law , i.e. , the law is scale - invariant , base - invariant , and power - invariant . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the lifetimes of hadrons follow also benford s law .    </S>",
    "<S> many numbers in the real world follow a fascinating pattern of distribution rather than a uniform distribution as might be expected . in 1881 </S>",
    "<S> , newcomb@xcite noticed that the preceding pages of the logarithmic table wear out faster , thus he hinted at the idea that the first nonzero digit of many natural numbers favors small values . then in 1938 , benford@xcite investigated a great number of data sets in various unrelated fields , e.g. , the arabic numbers on the front page of a newspaper , the wire and drill gauges of the mechanic , the magnitude scales of astronomy , the street addresses published in a magazine , the weights of molecules and atoms , the areas of lakes and the lengths of rivers , and he found that they all agree with a logarithmic distribution which now we refer to as benford s law , or the first digit law , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the probability of a number having the first nonzero digit @xmath3 .    surprisingly , there are plenty of unrelated data sets in the nature , e.g. , physical constants@xcite , alpha - decay half - lives@xcite , survival distributions@xcite , the strengths of electric - dipolar lines in transition arrays of complex atomic spectra@xcite , and numbers in our everyday lives , e.g. , the stock market indices@xcite , numbers in the world wide web@xcite , the file sizes in a personal computer@xcite , the winning bids for certain ebay auctions@xcite , all incredibly conform to the peculiar first digit law perfectly . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , tolle et al.@xcite provided empirical evidence that dynamical systems reveal the first digital behavior , and then snyder et al.@xcite developed corresponding computer simulations and confirmed the conclusion , and later it was discussed further by berger et al.@xcite in detail . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there also exist many data sets which do not obey the law , and unfortunately there is no priori criteria yet to judge which type a data set belongs to .    </S>",
    "<S> after the discovery for more than one century since 1881 , a universally accepted explanation for the underlying reason of such a law is still lacking . however , many literatures have exploited a lot of applications of the logarithmic distribution in various fields , and the first digit law has been used in practice already . the main usage is to detect data and judge their reasonableness . </S>",
    "<S> it is applied in distinguishing and ascertaining fraud in taxing and accounting@xcite , fabrication in clinical trials@xcite , authenticity of the pollutant concentrations in ambient air@xcite , electoral cheats or voting anomalies@xcite , and falsified data in scientific experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the first digit law is largely applied in computer science for speeding up calculation@xcite , minimizing expected storage space@xcite , analyzing the behavior of floating - point arithmetic algorithms@xcite , and especially for various studies in the image domain@xcite .    despite so many successful developments </S>",
    "<S> , there is no academic paper yet on the topic of benford s law in the well defined science domain of particle physics , to the best of our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we investigate the properties of particles by applying the first digit law , and find that in spite of the smallness of data capacity and the large span of the ranges , e.g. , @xmath4  mev for the neutron and @xmath5  mev for @xmath6 ) , the full widths of mesons and baryons pertain to the benford distribution very well respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence the benford s law applies to the full widths of hadrons with a rather good precision .    </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we scrutinize the meson summary table and baryon summary table in review of particle physics ( 2008 ) by particle data group@xcite , and compare the first digit distribution of the full widths of mesons and baryons with benford distribution respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the systematical statistical results are shown in table  [ meson ] for mesons and table  [ baryon ] for baryons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers in the bracket are the expected number , @xmath7 together with the root mean square error evaluated by the binomial distribution , @xmath8 the detail of the classification from case 1 to case 3 will be discussed later . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the results are very weakly case sensitive , and all are in good agreement with benford s law . </S>",
    "<S> the intuitive figures are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ layout ] , with the left row for mesons , the right row for baryons for case 1 to case 3 from the top down .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worthy to mention that , when estimating the fitness to the theoretical probability distribution , we should use fitness estimating @xmath9 , namely pearson @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the observational number and @xmath12 is the theoretical number from benford s law , and here in our question @xmath13 . however , it is not appropriate to use parameter estimating @xmath9 as used in refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pearson ] ) , the degree of freedom is @xmath14 , and under the confidence level 95% , @xmath15 , and under the confidence level 50% , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 we calculated is smaller than those in refs .  , indicating clearly that the fitness is remarkably good in particle physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the classification from case 1 to case 3 is due to the incompleteness and uncertainty of experimental data , however , we do our best to treat data without bias . </S>",
    "<S> since we only deal with the full widths of hadrons , we ignore the @xmath17 width @xmath18 and we do not distinguish the difference between the full width and the breit - wigner full width given in the baryon summary table . </S>",
    "<S> when the summary tables give only the lifetime @xmath19 instead of the full width @xmath20 , we use @xmath21 to get the corresponding full width . </S>",
    "<S> and we drop the single - side data , e.g. , @xmath22  mev for @xmath23 , while we still keep the double - side data and pick the mean value of the boundaries , for instance , given 200 to 500  mev for @xmath24 , we treat it as @xmath25  mev , and when given the most likely values in these two - boundary cases , we chose them for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> but there still remain some puzzled data due to the isospin problem . for most hadrons of the same isospin @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , there are several types of particles due to the different isospin projection @xmath27 , and the summary table separates some while it does not distinguish between others definitely , however , the same isospin does not always promise the same lifetime hence the same full width . for the stringency of our approach </S>",
    "<S> , we use the following three schemes to deal with the data :    in case 1 , we just drop out the puzzled data ;    in case 2 , we faithfully follow the classification published in the particle table and treat each item as a whole , and when there are several full widths appearing under one item , we pick the mean value and only count for once ;    and in case 3 , we stick to the appearance of the data , that is , when there is a datum , we count it for once .    </S>",
    "<S> though the fitness is so impressive , we still feel short of data . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we add mesons and baryons up to get the distribution of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in table  [ hadron ] numerically , and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ghadronwithout ] , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ghadronaverage ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ghadronwithall ] graphically . </S>",
    "<S> they all appear remarkably good .    </S>",
    "<S> many attempts have been tried to explain the underlying reason for benford s law . for theoretical reviews , </S>",
    "<S> see ref .   and papers written by hill@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here present some discussions on the first digit law , focusing on its several general properties .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a positive date set can be rewritten in the form of \\{@xmath28 } , where @xmath29 is an integer not affecting the first digit , and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the fractional part which contributes to the question . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested and derived by newcomb@xcite , a uniform distribution of the fractional part @xmath30 of the exponent in the interval @xmath32 leads to the logarithmic law .    secondly , </S>",
    "<S> as can be expected , multiplication of a constant upon the data set does not change the probability distribution , the reason of which is that the exponent of new datum @xmath33 satisfies @xmath34 this property means that the law does not depend on any particular choice of units , namely scale - invariance@xcite , which was discovered by pinkham in 1961 . in mathematics , </S>",
    "<S> this law is the only digital law that is scale - invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , any power of the data set does not change the distribution either , i.e. , the law is power - invariant . because of @xmath35 for @xmath36 , </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic distribution remains unchanged according to the first property . in our research , </S>",
    "<S> the full widths of hadrons fit the logarithmic distribution , so do the lifetimes of hadrons .    </S>",
    "<S> fourthly , the benford s law is base - invariant@xcite too , which means that it is independent of the base @xmath37 you use . </S>",
    "<S> in the binary system ( @xmath37=2 ) , octal system ( @xmath37=8 ) , or other base system , the data , as well as in the decimal system ( @xmath37=10 ) , all fit the general first digit law , @xmath38 hill proved strictly that `` scale - invariance implies base - invariance''@xcite and `` base - invariance implies benford s law''@xcite mathematically in the framework of probability theory .    </S>",
    "<S> fifthly , in 2001 , pietronero et al.@xcite provided a new insight , suggesting that a process or an object @xmath39 with its time evolution governed by multiplicative fluctuations generates benford s law naturally and they used stockmarket as a convictive example . </S>",
    "<S> further , they demonstrated it with the computer simulation and got rather good result . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a random variable . after treating @xmath42 as a new random variable , </S>",
    "<S> it is a brownian process @xmath43 in the logarithmic space . utilizing the central limit theorem in a large sample , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 becomes uniformly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath45 which is exactly the formula of benford s law given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ benford ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is well recommended in refs .  .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we applied benford s law to the well defined science domain of particle physics for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the first digits of the full widths of hadrons , including mesons and baryons respectively , all fit the logarithmic law remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we discussed several general properties of the law , and reached the conclusion that our results apply to the lifetimes of hadrons as well . </S>",
    "<S> it is still a challenge to find the basic reason for the common distribution pattern among various sorts of natural behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest the necessity to look into some hitherto unnoticed features of basic physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the first digit law can serve as a tool to test the reasonableness of any theory or model that is supposed to be the underlaying theory of the nature . </S>"
