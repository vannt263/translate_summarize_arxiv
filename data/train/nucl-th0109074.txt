    "the issue of charge symmetry violation ( csv ) is fundamental to our understanding of hadronic interactions , and many experimental and theoretical studies have addressed this issue ( see review @xcite ) . in the framework of qcd , csv arises from the mass difference between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks .",
    "the other principal cause for csv comes from the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "weinberg @xcite pointed out that the effective chiral @xmath13 lagrangian , coming from qcd , contains a term which violates charge symmetry ( see also , a recent review by meissner @xcite ) .",
    "thus , not only are there kinematic reasons for csv due to the mass differences within baryon multiplets , but direct csv effects should exist as well .",

    "the @xmath14 cross section is compared with that for @xmath15 in masterson _",
    "_ @xcite and baru _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but only small differences are found .    for pion elastic scattering from @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one can consider three mirror ratios formed from the differential cross sections : @xmath16 where @xmath6 is refereed to as the  superratio \" @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 scattering cross sections are isomirror ones , as are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if charge symmetry were conserved , all three ratios would be equal to unity .",
    "of course , the coulomb interaction is not charge symmetric and has to be taken into account .",
    "the experimental study of these ratios has been concentrated on large - angle scattering because the coulomb interaction , which intrinsically violates charge symmetry , makes a significant contribution in the forward - scattering region . in a series of lampf experiments @xcite , the ratios ( [ 1 ] )",
    "were measured in the range of the @xmath21 @xmath13 resonance .",
    "significant deviation ( several standard deviations ) from unity ( up to @xmath2220% ) was observed for @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the angular range outside of the coulomb cone , @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , strong angular dependence of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 was observed in the angular interval between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these csv effects are much more pronounced for @xmath2 and @xmath3 than for @xmath26 , where the observed asymmetry @xmath27 elastic scattering have been evaluated in terms of the asymmetry @xmath27 : @xmath28 if we define @xmath29 by analogy with the ratios ( [ 1 ] ) , we get @xmath30 and for small @xmath31 we have @xmath32 .",

    "@xcite .    thus , csv effects manifest themselves clearly in the three - nucleon system , even if they are very small in the deuteron case . for this reason ,",
    "the main goal of our theoretical analysis is the elucidation of the mechanisms that enhance csv in the three - nucleon system . in other words",
    ", can the observed enhancement be due only to the well - known mass differences of the hadron multiplets together with the coulomb interaction ?",
    "previous studies have indicated that the main reason for csv in the case of the deuteron is the mass difference of the charge @xmath34-isobar states .",
    "the influence of this effect on the scattering amplitude of the @xmath35 elastic scattering was discussed in the papers by masterson _",
    "_ @xcite and baru _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for single and single - with - double scattering , respectively . naturally , as the number of multiple - scattering diagrams increases with an increasing number of nucleons , one expects the effect of the @xmath10-mass splitting to be more prominent for @xmath2 and @xmath3 than for @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to the interaction between charged pions and nuclei due to the external coulomb force , there is an internal coulomb interaction due to the difference in the wave functions ( wfs ) of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "( note that in terms of the strong interaction , there is no difference between the wfs of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . )",
    "one difference in these wfs arises from the additional coulomb repulsion between the two protons in @xmath3 , which is not present in @xmath2 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference in the structure of @xmath2 and @xmath3 has been described by a first order optical potential in the pion - nuclear interaction in which the @xmath2 and @xmath3 charge and magnetic form factors extracted from experimental data on elastic electron scattering from @xmath2 and @xmath3 were used .",
    "a more detailed analysis of pion-@xmath36 elastic and inelastic scattering was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an optical single - scattering pion - nuclear potential , calculated at a microscopic level with a realistic three - nucleon wave function , was used .",
    "no reasonable description of the csv effects was achieved when the calculations were performed with isospin - symmetric wave functions for both nuclei .",
    "a different approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the difference in the wfs of @xmath2 and @xmath3 was taken into account explicitly . in all of these approaches @xcite , the difference in the structure of the three - nucleon system results in a sharp enhancement of the ratios @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the angular range @xmath37 .",
    "one of the reasons for this behavior of the angular distribution is that the elastic differential cross section in the single - scattering approach contains a significant contribution at small scattering angles and has a minimum at @xmath38 which is related to the dip in the @xmath13 non - spin - flip amplitude .",
    "therefore , even a small contribution to the interaction that violates charge symmetry ( _ e.g. _ , the coulomb interaction ) can produce an enhanced effect .",
    "the influence of the @xmath10-mass splitting on the observed csv effect might also result in a large effect in this angular range .",
    "moreover , to understand the angular distribution in detail , one must look beyond the single - scattering approach to the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "we therefore examine the contributions of both single- and double-@xmath13 scattering to the pion - nuclear scattering amplitude following techniques developed in ref .",
    "we then take csv effects into account to obtain expressions for the ratios ( [ 1 ] ) , which then are compared with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the experimental status for the ratios ( [ 1 ] ) at energies spanning the @xmath8 resonance is given in section  [ sec : expt ] . in section  [ sec : theor1 ] , we explain how the basic ingredients of the scattering amplitude and the constraints of single and double scattering are combined for @xmath39 and @xmath40 elastic scattering . in section  [ sec : theor2 ] , we derive expressions for the scattering amplitudes , taking into account all three effects responsible for csv . in section  [ sec : theor3 ] , we discuss the influence of these factors on the ratios ( [ 1 ] ) to show the effect of the individual csv factors , and we compare the results of our calculations with the data . in section  [ sec : add ] , we discuss some related issues associated with csv effects in other nuclei over broader ranges in energy and scattering angle . in section  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "csv in pion - nucleus scattering was first claimed to have been observed in the difference of total @xmath41 cross sections measured at psi  @xcite , and ascribed to the @xmath10-mass splitting .",
    "essentially , the total cross section is mainly determined by the forward scattering amplitude , which at small angles can be approximated well by single scattering . in this approach ,",
    "the different charge states of the @xmath10 are excited in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering on the deuteron , and the result is the small observed csv effect .",
    "this has been discussed widely ( see _ e.g. _ , the book by ericson and weise @xcite ) .",
    "the situation with the observation of csv effects in the @xmath41 differential cross sections is less clear .",
    "the first systematic study of the csv effect in the differential @xmath41 cross sections was done at lampf  @xcite .",
    "there have been several subsequent measurements at lampf and triumf for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see ref .",

    "thus , the magnitude of csv is at most 1@xmath432% , the sign is uncertain , and the experimental uncertainties are only slightly less than the @xmath27 values themselves .    at about the same time , however , measurements of the ratios ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath2 and @xmath3 at lampf obtained significantly larger effects . the first evidence for a sizable csv in the differential @xmath45 cross sections ) .",

    "the experiment was repeated with better statistics and systematics for approximately the same range of scattering angles at energies spanning the @xmath10 @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "these measurements also were extended to backward angles from @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xcite and are reported in the previous paper @xcite .",
