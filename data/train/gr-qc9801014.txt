    "in searching for gravitational waves from an inspiralling compact binary ( icb ) we are faced with the following data analysis problem : on the one hand , we have some exact gravitational wave form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the parameters of the signal ( eg . , the masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the members of the emitting binary ) . on the other hand",
    ", we have theoretical calculations of the motion of  @xcite , and gravitational radiation from  @xcite , binary systems of compact bodies ( neutron stars or black holes ) giving the post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions ( expansions in powers of @xmath5 ) of an energy function @xmath6 and a gravitational wave luminosity function @xmath7 . here , the dimensionless argument @xmath8 is an invariantly defined `` velocity '' related to the instantaneous _ gravitational wave _ frequency @xmath9 ( @xmath10 twice the _ orbital _",
    "frequency ) by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total mass of the binary . given the energy and flux functions one needs to compute the `` phasing formula '' , i.e. an accurate mathematical model for the evolution of the gravitational wave phase @xmath13,$ ] involving the set of parameters @xmath14 carrying information about the emitting binary system .",
    "the standard energy - balance equation @xmath15 gives the following parametric representation of the phasing formula : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are integration constants .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of what is known about the two functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 entering the phasing formula and how that knowledge can be improved .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the symmetric mass ratio , denote the @xmath22-order taylor approximants of the energy and flux functions . for finite @xmath23",
    "the above taylor approximants are known  @xcite for @xmath24 in the test mass limit , i.e. @xmath25 @xmath6 is known exactly , the exact flux is known numerically  @xcite and analytically the flux is known  @xcite up to the order @xmath26 .",
    "the problem is to construct a sequence of approximate wave forms @xmath27 , starting from the pn expansions of @xmath6 and @xmath28 in formal terms , any such construction defines a _ map _ from the set of the taylor coefficients of @xmath29 and @xmath30 into the ( functional ) space of wave forms . up to now , the literature has only considered the standard map , say @xmath31 , @xmath32 obtained by inserting the successive taylor approximants into the phasing formula  @xcite .",
    "we propose a new map , say `` @xmath33 '' , based on two essential ingredients : ( i ) the introduction , on theoretical grounds , of two new , supposedly more basic and hopefully better behaved , energy - type and flux - type functions , say @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and ( ii ) the systematic use of pad approximants ( instead of straightforward taylor expansions ) when constructing successive approximants of the intermediate functions @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "schematically , our procedure is  @xcite : @xmath36 , f[e_{p_n } , f_{p_n } ] ) \\rightarrow h_n^p ( t,\\lambda_k ) \\ , .",
    "\\label { eq : n5}\\ ] ]    our new energy function @xmath37 where @xmath38 is constructed out of the total relativistic energy @xmath39 using @xmath40 the function @xmath41 is symmetric in the two masses .",
    "the function @xmath42 entering the phasing formulas is given in terms of @xmath41 by @xmath43^{1/2 } - 1 .",
    "\\label{eq : etilde1}\\ ] ]    in the test - mass limit the exact expression for the function @xmath41 can be computed from its definition above which when substitute in eq .",
    "( [ eq : etilde1 ] ) gives the well known energy function for a test mass in orbit around a schwarzschild black hole : @xmath44 the test mass exact energy function @xmath41 has a simple pole singularity while the function @xmath42 has in addition a branch cut .",
    "therefore the function @xmath41 is more suitable in analysing the analytic structure . in the comparable mass case , on the grounds of mathematical continuity between the case @xmath45 and the case of finite @xmath23",
    "one can expect the exact function @xmath41 to admit a simple pole singularity on the real axis @xmath46 we do not know the location of this singularity , but _",
    "pad approximants _ are excellent tools for giving accurate representations of functions having such pole singularities  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the pad approximant of the 2pn expansion of @xmath41 gives the exact energy function  @xcite .",
    "we therefore use pad approximants of @xmath41 in computing the energy function @xmath42 entering the phasing formula instead of the standard taylor approximants .",
    "this greatly improves the accuracy of the phasing formula .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite that the flux function @xmath47 has a simple pole at the light ring @xmath48 .",
    "the light ring orbit corresponds to a simple pole @xmath49 in the new energy function @xmath50 .",
    "let us define the corresponding ( invariant ) `` velocity '' @xmath51 .",
    "this motivates the introduction of the following `` factored '' flux function , its pad approximants @xmath52 and the corresponding flux function entering the phasing formula : @xmath53",
    "in order to test whether a given approximant to the wave form is good or not we make use of the statistic used in detecting the icb signal .",
    "we shall say that a multi - parameter family of approximate wave forms @xmath54 , @xmath55 is an _",
    "effectual _ model of some exact wave form @xmath0 ; @xmath56 ( where one allows the number of model parameters @xmath57 to be different from , i.e. in practice , strictly smaller than @xmath58 ) if the overlap , or normalized ambiguity function , between @xmath0 and the time - translated family @xmath59 , @xmath60 is , after maximization on the model parameters @xmath61 , larger than some given threshold , e.g. @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : n6 ] ) the scalar product @xmath63 denotes the usual wiener bilinear form involving the noise spectrum @xmath64 . ]",
    "while an _ effectual _ model may be a precious tool for the successful detection of a signal , it may do a poor job in estimating the values of the signal parameters @xmath1 .",
    "we shall then say that a family of approximate wave forms @xmath65 , where the @xmath66 are now supposed to be in correspondence with ( at least a subset of ) the signal parameters , is a _",
    "faithful _ model of @xmath0 if the ambiguity function @xmath67 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : n6 ] ) , is maximized for values of the model parameters @xmath66 which differ from the exact ones @xmath1 only by acceptably small biases . a necessary criterion for faithfulness , and",
    "one which is very easy to implement in practice , is that the `` diagonal '' ambiguity @xmath68 be larger than , say , 0.965 . using this terminology eq .",
    "( [ eq : n5 ] ) defines approximants which , for practically all values of @xmath69 we could test , are both more effectual ( larger overlaps ) and more faithful ( smaller biases ) than the standard approximants eq .",
    "( [ eq : n4 ] ) . the new sequence of @xmath33-approximants exhibit a systematically better convergence behavior than the @xmath31-approximants  @xcite . the overlaps they achieve at a fixed pn order are usually much higher . from our extensive study",
    "@xcite of the formal  test - mass limit \" @xmath70 it appears that the presently known @xmath71-accurate pn results allow one to construct approximants having overlaps larger than 96.5% .",
    "such overlaps are enough to guarantee that no more than 10% of signals may remain undetected .",

    "we have also listed biases in the measurement of parameters .",
    "we clearly notice the superiority of the @xmath33-approximants .    though we believe that the the new approximants @xmath102 are superior over the standard ones @xmath103 and shows the practical sufficiency of the presently known @xmath104-accurate pn results",
    ", we still think that it is an important ( and challenging ) task to improve the ( finite mass ) pn results .",
    "our calculations also suggest that knowing @xmath29 and @xmath30 to @xmath105 would further improve the effectualness ( maximized overlap larger than 99.5% ) and , more importantly , the faithfulness ( diagonal overlap larger than 98% ) to a level allowing a loss in the number of detectable events smaller than 1% , and significantly smaller biases ( smaller than 0.5% ) in the parameter estimations than the present @xmath71 results ( about 15% ) .",
