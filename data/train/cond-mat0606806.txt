    "the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) on geometrically frustrated lattices has attracted much attention during last years.@xcite besides intriguing quantum ground - state phases at zero magnetic field those systems often show unconventional properties in finite magnetic fields like plateaus and jumps in the magnetization curve , see e.g. ref . .",
    "the recent finding that a wide class of geometrically frustrated quantum spin antiferromagnets ( including the kagom , checkerboard and pyrochlore lattices ) has quite simple ground states in the vicinity of the saturation field,@xcite namely independent localized - magnon states , has further stimulated studies of the corresponding frustrated quantum antiferromagnets at high magnetic fields.@xcite in particular , the low - temperature high - field thermodynamics of various one- and two - dimensional frustrated quantum antiferromagnets which support localized - magnon states , can be discussed from a quite universal point of view by mapping the low - energy degrees of freedom of the quantum hafm onto lattice gases of hard - core objects.@xcite for instance , the kagom ( checkerboard ) hafm in the vicinity of the saturation field can be mapped onto a gas of hard hexagons ( squares ) on a triangular ( square ) lattice.@xcite the exactly soluble hard - hexagon model exhibits an order - disorder second - order phase transition.@xcite the hard - core lattice - gas model corresponding to the checkerboard hafm consists of large hard squares on the square lattice with edge vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( i.e. there is a nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor exclusion ) . for the latter model",
    "no exact solution is available , but most likely there is also an order - disorder phase transition.@xcite the existence of a phase transition in the hard - hexagon ( large - hard - square ) model would imply a corresponding finite - temperature transition of the corresponding spin model near saturation provided the low - temperature physics is correctly described by the hard - core lattice - gas model .",
    "however , at the present state of the investigations no conclusive statements for the kagom and checkerboard antiferromagnets are available , since both models admit additional degenerate eigenstates not described by the hard - hexagon / large - hard - square model.@xcite furthermore for these spin models precise statements on the gap between the localized - magnon ground states and the excitations are not available .",
    "therefore , the effect of additional ground states and the excited states on the low - temperature thermodynamics remains unclear .",
    "the motivation for the present paper is to find and discuss another two - dimensional frustrated quantum hafm , for which a hard - core lattice gas completely covers all low - energy states of the spin model in the vicinity of the saturation field and where all excitations are separated by a finite energy gap .",
    "for such a spin model one can expect that an order - disorder phase transition inherent in the hard - core lattice - gas model can be observed as a finite - temperature phase transition in the spin model .",
    "it might be worth to note that such a phase transition of course does not contradict the mermin - wagner theorem@xcite that forbids magnetic long - range order ( breaking the rotational symmetry ) for the two - dimensional heisenberg model at any non - zero temperature and at zero field .",
    "a spin model which satisfies these requirements is a frustrated bilayer quantum hafm .",
    "the investigation of the bilayer quantum hafm was initially motivated by bilayer high-@xmath2 superconductors@xcite and has been continued till present time , see e.g. ref . and references therein .",
    "below we will illustrate that the corresponding hard - core lattice - gas model is a model of hard squares on a square lattice , however , in difference to the checkerboard lattice with smaller hard squares with edge vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( i.e. there is a nearest - neighbor exclusion , only , cf .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "this hard - square model exhibits an order - disorder phase transition.@xcite in the context of different universality classes discussed in ref .",
    "the frustrated bilayer quantum hafm is the first example of a spin system which belongs to the universality class of ( small ) hard squares .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we specify the frustrated bilayer model and illustrated the corresponding localized - magnon states ( sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) . then in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we calculate the contribution of the independent localized - magnon states to the thermodynamic quantities using the hard - square model . we compare our results with exact diagonalization data for finite spin-1/2 heisenberg systems of up to @xmath5 sites . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we report the low - temperature high - field thermodynamic quantities obtained on the basis of monte carlo simulations for hard squares focusing on the ( low-)temperature dependence of the specific heat in the vicinity of the saturation field .",
    "to be specific , we consider the nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field on the lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .     whereas all other bonds have the strength @xmath6 .",
    "the trapping cells ( vertical bonds ) occupied by localized magnons are shown by fat lines .",
    "the auxiliary square lattice is a simple square lattice filled by hard squares ( indicated as red squares ) which correspond to localized magnons.,width=302 ]    this lattice may be viewed as a two - dimensional version of the frustrated two - leg ladder considered in refs .",
    "( for some similar models see ref . ) .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian of @xmath7 quantum spins of length @xmath8 reads @xmath9 here the sum runs over the bonds ( edges ) which connect the neighboring sites ( vertices ) on the spin lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "@xmath10 are the antiferromagnetic exchange constants between the sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 which take two values , namely , @xmath13 for the vertical bonds and @xmath6 for all other bonds .",
    "@xmath14 is the exchange interaction anisotropy parameter , @xmath15 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath16 is the @xmath17-component of the total spin . in our exact diagonalization studies reported below",
    "we will focus on @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the hamiltonian ( [ 01 ] ) commutes with the operator @xmath20 and hence we may consider the subspaces of its eigenstates with different values of @xmath20 separately .",
    "evidently , the fully polarized state @xmath21 is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ 01 ] ) with @xmath22 and can be considered as the vacuum state with respect to the number of excited magnons .",
    "this state is the ground state for high magnetic fields .",
    "consider next the one - magnon subspace with @xmath23 .",
    "the one - particle energy is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( here @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . obviously , the excitation branch @xmath30 is dispersionless and it becomes the lower one when @xmath31 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath32 .",
    "then the saturation field is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 dispersionless one - magnon excitations can be written as localized excitations on the @xmath34 vertical bonds , i.e. @xmath35 is an eigenstate of ( [ 01 ] ) in the subspace with @xmath23 with the zero - field eigenvalue @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in @xmath39",
    "the first part is the localized one - magnon excitation on the vertical bond number @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 and the second part @xmath42 is the fully polarized environment .",
    "we pass to the subspaces with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "we can easily construct many - particle states in these subspaces using the localized - magnon states .",
    "explicitly the wave function of @xmath11 independent localized magnons has the form @xmath45 it is important to note that any two vertical bonds @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ 02 ] ) where localized magnons live are not allowed to be direct neighbors .",
    "the energy of the @xmath11 independent localized - magnon state ( [ 02 ] ) in zero field @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath11 independent localized magnons can be put on the bilayer in many ways the eigenstates ( [ 02 ] ) are highly degenerate .",
    "we denote this degeneracy by @xmath50 , that is the number of ways to put @xmath11 hard squares on a lattice of @xmath51 sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . according to refs .",
    "the independent localized - magnon states ( [ 02 ] ) are the states with the lowest energy in the corresponding subspaces .",
    "moreover , they are linearly independent ( orthogonal type in the nomenclature of ref . ) and form an orthogonal basis in each subspace.@xcite due to their linear independence they all contribute to the partition function of the spin system .    in the presence of an external field",
    "the eigenstates ( [ 02 ] ) have the energy @xmath52 . at the saturation field ,",
    "@xmath53 , all they are ground states and the ground - state energy @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath11 . as a result",
    "the ground - state magnetization curve exhibits a jump at the saturation field .",
    "this jump is accompanied by a preceding wide plateau , where the width of this plateau can be obtained following the arguments given in ref . and from finite - size data .",
    "we find for @xmath18 , @xmath19 a plateau width of @xmath55 .",
    "this plateau belongs to the two - fold degenerate ground state with maximum density @xmath44 of localized magnons , the so - called magnon crystal,@xcite where all localized magnons occupy only one of the two sublattices of the underlying square lattice .",
    "furthermore , the degeneracy of independent localized - magnon states at the saturation field @xmath56 grows exponentially with the system size @xmath7 that implies a nonzero ground - state residual entropy @xmath57 ( see ref . and also below ) . due to their high degeneracy",
    "the independent localized - magnon states are also dominating the thermodynamic properties at low temperatures for magnetic fields around the saturation field as we will dicuss in detail below .",
    "we want to calculate the contribution of the independent localized magnons to the canonical partition function of the spin system , @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath50 is the canonical partition function @xmath60 of @xmath11 hard squares on a square lattice of @xmath51 sites , whereas @xmath61 is the grand canonical partition function of hard squares on a square lattice of @xmath51 sites and @xmath62 is the chemical potential of the hard squares . as a result",
    "we arrive at the basic relation between the localized - magnon contribution to the canonical partition function of the spin model and the grand canonical partition function of hard - square model , @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ 04 ] ) yields the helmholtz free energy of the spin system @xmath64 , whereas the entropy @xmath65 , the specific heat @xmath66 and the magnetization @xmath67 are given by the usual formulas , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "we use exact diagonalization data to check this picture for @xmath18 isotropic heisenberg system ( [ 01 ] ) of @xmath71 and @xmath72 sites ( full diagonalization ) and @xmath5 ( only in the subspaces with @xmath73 ) imposing periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we fix the energy scale by putting @xmath74 . for the vertical exchange bonds we consider @xmath75 .",
    "first we compare the degeneracies @xmath50 of the localized @xmath11-magnon states calculated for spin systems of sizes @xmath76 with the corresponding values @xmath77 of the hard - square model .",
    "as expected we find complete agreement between both models for @xmath31 . as an example we give here the numbers for @xmath72 : @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath80 the spin system has one extra state for @xmath81 , i.e. in the one - magnon sector , since the dispersive mode @xmath82 and the dispersionless mode @xmath30 are degenerate at @xmath83 .    to estimate the relevance of excited states , not described by the localized - magnon scenario ,",
    "we have determined the thermodynamically relevant energy separation @xmath84 between the localized - magnon states and the other states of the spin system by calculating the integrated low - energy density of states at saturation field .",
    "we define @xmath84 as that energy value above the localized - magnon ground - state energy , where the contribution of the higher - energy states to the integrated density of states becomes as large as the contribution of the localized - magnon states . for both values @xmath85 and @xmath86 we find @xmath87 independent of the size of the system @xmath7 .",
    "we can expect that the contribution of the localized - magnon states to the partition function is dominating for temperatures @xmath88 significantly smaller than @xmath84 .    in fig .",

    "thin lines correspond to the results for a small hard - square system @xmath94 ( thin dotted lines ) and @xmath95 ( thin solid lines ) .",
    "the exact diagonalization data for the temperatures up to @xmath96 coincide with the corresponding data for the @xmath94 hard - square system .",

    "both data sets coincide , demonstrating that the hard - square description perfectly works at low temperatures .",
    "but we observe good agreement also for higher temperatures up to @xmath100 , indicating that the independent localized magnons still dominate the thermodynamic quantities . further increasing @xmath88",
    ", the high - energy states more and more contribute to the partition function and the hard - square description loses its validity .",
    "note that an identical statement can be made for @xmath71 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "now we discuss the low - temperature high - field thermodynamics of the frustrated bilayer quantum hafm using the results for the hard - square model . from fig .",
    "[ fig02]b it is obvious , that fixing the temperature to a sufficiently low value the spin system can be driven through a phase transition by increasing the magnetic field @xmath15 towards the saturation field @xmath102 . on the other hand , we can fix the magnetic field slightly below the saturation field and vary the temperature .",
    "then the phase transition is driven by the temperature and the specific heat exhibits a singularity at a critical temperature @xmath103 , see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , where we show the results of a monte carlo simulation for large hard - square systems ( periodic cells with up to @xmath97 sites and @xmath104 steps ) for the specific heat for two values of the magnetic field .     for @xmath105 ( broken lines , diamonds ) and @xmath106 ( solid lines , triangles ) ( upper panel ) and for @xmath107 ( broken lines , diamonds ) and @xmath108 ( solid lines , triangles ) ( lower panel ) .",

    "the corresponding order parameter is the difference of the density ( of hard squares or localized magnons in hard - square or spin language , respectively ) on the a- and b - sublattices of the underlying square lattice.@xcite for @xmath112 ( i.e. for @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) both sublattices are equally occupied , but for @xmath115 ( i.e. for @xmath116 , @xmath114 ) one of two sublattices is more occupied than the other .",
    "therefore in the ordered phase the translational symmetry of the spin ( hard - square ) system is broken .",
    "finally , at @xmath117 only one sublattice is occupied and the other is empty and the ground state of the spin system is a magnon - crystal state , see sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] .",
    "we can estimate the critical temperature for a fixed deviation of the field from the saturation value using the above given expression for @xmath118 .",

    "such temperatures are within a temperature range where the hard - square description for finite systems works _ perfectly _ well ( see figs .  [ fig02 ] ,  [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "however , one may expect that the scenario of the phase transition may hold also at temperatures , for which the localized - magnon states are still dominant but also higher - energy states of the spin system not described by the hard - square model contribute to the partition function .",
    "we mention that the hard - square model belongs to the two - dimensional ising model universality class@xcite with the critical exponents @xmath127 for the order parameter and @xmath128 for the specific heat , i.e. the specific heat shows a logarithmic singularity at the critical point .",
    "note that this universality class is different from the one of the hard - hexagon model.@xcite thus , the low - temperature peak ( singularity ) in the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the vicinity of the saturation field is a spectacular sign of highly degenerate independent localized - magnon states of the frustrated bilayer quantum hafm .",
    "their ordering leads to the hard - square type peculiarity just below the saturation field .",
    "another thermodynamic quantity of interest is the curve of constant entropy as a function of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "since hard - square description implies the dependence of the entropy only on @xmath129 this curve is similar to an ideal paramagnet .",
    "therefore , the considered spin system is expected to exhibit a large magnetocaloric effect in the vicinity of the saturation field.@xcite    finally we note , that the effect of the localized magnons is a pure quantum effect which disappears as @xmath8 increasing approaches the classical limit @xmath130.@xcite",
