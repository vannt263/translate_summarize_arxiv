    "due to the emergence of cooperation between competitive rational players @xcite , the _ prisoner s dilemma _",
    "( pd ) @xcite is one of the most popular games of the game theory @xcite .",
    "when it is played repeatedly , one has the iterated prisoner s dilemma @xcite . if the pd is played in a group of players with spatial structure , this version is known as spatial prisoner s dilemma ( spd ) @xcite .",
    "these spatial structures may generate chaotically changing spatio - temporal patterns .",
    "cooperators and defectors coexist , and cooperator proportion oscillates indefinitely . this occurs when each player interacts with the nearest neighbors , for instance , in a square lattice .",
    "moreover , adding the interaction with the next nearest neighbors ( corresponding to the chess king possible moves ) the spatial patterns are smoother . during the game , cooperators and defectors organize themselves in clusters .",
    "the most interesting dynamics occurs on the borders of these clusters , causing the oscillating behavior of the proportion of cooperators .",
    "the final proportion of cooperators and defectors in the chaotic phase depends on the initial configuration and the magnitude of the parameter @xmath1 ( temptation ) .",
    "moreover , the connectivity among players also plays an important role in the dynamics of the clusters @xcite .",
    "studies about pd had been carried out in different topologies such as square lattice @xcite , graphs @xcite and also in complex networks as random graphs @xcite , scale - free networks @xcite , small - word networks @xcite . we have used the simplest lattice topology , i.e. one - dimensional lattice to represent regular lattices at any dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the computational implementation of pd in the one - dimensional case is simpler than in other topologies , and it requires less computational time to run the numerical codes . in one - dimensional cellular automata , it is simpler to understand the way that oscillations in the cooperator proportion take place @xcite . beyond the topologies ,",
    "it is also possible to consider the mobility of players @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an exhaustive exploration of the parameter space for the ipd in the one - dimensional cellular automata with a variable number of interacting neighbors . after introducing the model in section [ themodel ]",
    ", we show the results in section [ resultados ] .",
    "final remarks are presented in the section [ conclusao ] .",
    "consider a cellular automaton in a one - dimensional lattice , with @xmath2 cells , where each cell represents one player , who has two possible states : @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) for cooperator ( defector ) .",
    "the automaton has no empty cells , so the cooperator proportions , @xmath5 , and defectors , @xmath6 , leads to @xmath7 .",
    "the initial proportion of cooperators , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is an important parameter .",
    "the state of @xmath10 players , which are chosen randomly by a uniform distribution , are set as cooperators and the remaining ones are set as defectors .",
    "the neighborhood of the @xmath11-th player is defined by @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath0 is even , there are @xmath13 adjacent interacting players to the right and to the left hand side of this player .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd , each side has @xmath14 players and player @xmath11 interacts with his / her own state ( self - interaction ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath15 and @xmath0 the other free parameter in this model is the temptation @xmath1 in the conflict range @xmath16 .",
    "consider two players @xmath11 and @xmath17 playing the pd .",
    "the payoff of player @xmath11 due to interaction with player @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the state of player @xmath17 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the total payoff , @xmath21 , of player @xmath11 is : @xmath22 , , where @xmath23 is the neighborhood of the @xmath11-th agent .",
    "since the payoff of each player depends on @xmath0 , the macroscopic regime , @xmath24 , also depends on it .",
    "player @xmath11 will compare @xmath21 to @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the payoff of @xmath26 set of players . if @xmath27 , player @xmath11 copies the state of the player with the highest payoff , otherwise player @xmath11 does not change his / her current state .",
    "the dynamics of the model is totally deterministic .",
    "this strategy of copying the state of the neighbor that had the highest payoff is the darwinian evolutionary strategy .",
    "others evolutionary strategies can be adopted , like the pavlovian one @xcite .",
    "the states of the players are updated synchronously and they play until the system reaches a stationary or dynamical equilibrium regime .",
    "the cooperator proportion , @xmath28 , depends on time , temptation , initial proportion of cooperators , and the number of interacting players .",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath0 is commonly neglected , possibly due to the fixed lattice restriction in a @xmath29-dimensional space .",
    "the asymptotic cooperator proportion , @xmath30 , is obtained when the system reaches the steady state , which represents the final phase for the set of parameters @xmath31 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath0 can be understood due to the number of interacting cooperators , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , in the neighborhood of each player .",
    "when player @xmath11 interacts with @xmath35 cooperators out of @xmath0 neighbors , his / her payoff is @xcite : @xmath36c_i$ ] .",
    "some useful relations follow immediately : for a cooperator @xmath37 , while for a defector @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "transitions in @xmath42 occur when temptation crosses threshold values . in the conflict range ,",
    "@xmath43 , these transitions are controlled by @xcite : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 $ ] are integers .",
    "we have used a one - dimensional cellular automaton with @xmath47 cells , with @xmath48 cells set as cooperators and the remaining ones as defectors . the asymptotic cooperator proportion , @xmath32 , is obtained from the mean values of an ensemble of 1,000 configurations for the same initial parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 increases in steps @xmath49 in the range @xmath43 and @xmath15 increases in steps @xmath50 and the intermediate values are linearly interpolated .",
    "it could seem meaningless to consider @xmath51 , as the cooperators and defectors have the same payoff , when one plays against the other .",
    "however , the total payoff of each player depends on the neighborhood , then , if the player belongs to a cooperative cluster he / she has a higher payoff than the player from a defective one . in the cooperative / defective clusters border ,",
    "the differences among payoffs are essential to determine the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the trivial cases due to the darwinian evolutionary strategy . in a population of cooperators ( defectors ) it is not possible to emerge a defector ( cooperator ) , because the players only can copy the states of their neighbors .",
    "mutations are not allowed in our model , i.e. the noise of the system is null @xcite .",
    "our results are equivalent to those obtained in the square lattices , which are briefly reviewed in the following",
    ". consider four scenarios .",
    "first , defectors can dominate the system and determine the complete extinction of cooperators , leading the system to a defective phase ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "second , defectors can increase and domain the system , but cooperators are not extinguished , resulting in a defective phase as well ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "third , cooperators may domain the system forming a cooperative phase ( @xmath56 ) . and",
    "finally , cooperators can extinguish the defectors determining a cooperative phase ( @xmath57 ) .",
