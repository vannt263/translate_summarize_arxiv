    "the quantum mechanics of interacting many - particle systems presents an intractable problem for classical computers . the vast hilbert space and the correlation between particles prohibits the exact simulation of all but the smallest systems by classical means .",
    "thus , by manipulating and observing even a relatively small many - particle system a  computation \" could be performed which no classical computer would be capable of .",
    "such a system , together with its measuring apparatus is referred to as a  quantum computer \" @xcite .",
    "extensive research in this field has shown that quantum computers can be used to solve any computational problem , that is , they are capable of universal computation .",
    "however , it is clear that they are efficient at simulating quantum systems,@xcite , and fast algorithms for factoring large numbers @xcite and searching databases @xcite have been found .",
    "two factors considerably simplify the design of a suitable many - particle system for universal quantum computation : it is sufficient to construct only a single line of two - state systems ( so called qubits ) which are weakly coupled @xcite ; and it is not necessary to maintain global phase coherence throughout a computation @xcite .",
    "these simplifications are probably outweighed by the necessity that each qubit must be individually addressable , so that its pseudospin can be independently rotated through an arbitrary angle about any two chosen `` axes '' , and by the requirement that the coupling between each pair of qubits must be accurately controllable .",
    "useful qubits , together with suitable coupling mechanisms , can be found in almost every area of physics and chemistry and there are a growing number of attempts to demonstrate control over the rotation of and coupling between qubits @xcite .",
    "the proposal for quantum computation that we outline in this paper is in the semiconductor quantum dot category @xcite .",
    "it is based on recent experiments in which a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) is passed across a semiconductor heterostructure containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and is incident on a depleted quasi - one - dimensional channel ( q1dc ) . in this experiment",
    "it is possible to capture a single electron from the 2deg in each minimum of the saw wave and transport them through the q1dc @xcite .",
    "our proposal is based on the assumption that by placing a series of @xmath0 q1dcs in parallel , a saw can be made to capture @xmath0 electrons in each of its minima , with one electron in each q1dc .",
    "a single quantum computation would be performed by the @xmath0 electrons in a single saw minimum as they are dragged through a pattern of magnetic and non - magnetic surface gates , which carry out single and two - qubit operations . at the end of the computation the electrons",
    "would then be channeled into a set of @xmath0 readout gates that would determine the final spin state of each electron .",
    "each saw minimum would contain an identical number of electrons prepared in an identical manner and would therefore perform the same computation .",
    "this would allow the readout gates to produce a measurable current representing the output of the quantum computer .",
    "since the qubits would be carried along with the saw , this proposal is an example of a `` flying qubit '' design @xcite .",
    "we discuss these ideas based on using the electron spin to encode the qubits , but the idea could easily be extended to use the two states of a double quantum well , or the transverse states in laterally patterned parallel q1dcs .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the saw - based single - electron transport experiment , and discuss how saws incident on a q1dc capture electrons .",
    "we then discuss how a magnetic field would enable the electrons to be captured as qubits in prepared states . in section iii",
    "we show how magnetic gating can be used for single qubit operations , and how non - magnetic gating can produce two - qubit operations .",
    "a simple model is used to detail the operation of the two - qubit gate .",
    "section iv discusses the integration of the single and two - qubit gates to produce a c - not gate and larger networks of gates .",
    "section v addresses the question of how the final state of the qubits can be read out and in section vi we consider possible sources of error and decoherence .",
    "figure  [ exptdevice ] shows a schematic diagram of a saw - based quantised - current device @xcite .",
    "it consists of a gaas / algaas heterostructure with nicr / al interdigitated transducers patterned either side of a central etch - defined mesa which contains a 2deg . when a high frequency a.c .",
    "signal is applied to one of these transducers it produces a saw , via the piezoelectric effect , which can be detected with the other transducer . as a saw propagates across the mesa region , the traveling periodic electrostatic potential it produces drags electrons from the 2deg along with it . for a typical saw frequency of 3 ghz and an applied power of 10 dbm",
    "this produces a measurable current in the nanoamp range . for the quantised current devices ,",
    "the mesa is patterned so that it is split into two 2deg regions ( source and drain ) connected by a narrow depleted q1dc .",
    "the q1dc can be formed either by surface schottky gates , or by an etching technique developed by kristensen _",
    "_ @xcite as shown in fig  1 .",
    "it has been shown experimentally @xcite that over certain ranges of saw power and gate voltage , the current which is produced by the saw becomes quantised in units of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the elementary electronic charge and @xmath3 is the saw frequency .",
    "the lowest quantised value observed represents the transport of a single electron from the source to the drain reservoir in each saw minimum through the q1dc .",
    "the electrons travel through the q1dc with a mean speed equal to the saw velocity , which is 2700ms@xmath4 on the ( 001 ) plane of gaas .",
    "recent experimental results have demonstrated this effect with an accuracy of five parts in @xmath5 @xcite .      at present , there is only an incomplete understanding of the mechanism by which electrons are captured and transported by the saw through the q1dc @xcite .",
    "this capture process is intrinsically time dependent ; it involves the coulomb interaction between many particles ; and includes quantum mechanical confinement , tunneling and decoherence .",
    "figures.[captureb0]a , b show a contour plot of the effective potential in the q1dc connecting the source and drain 2degs , and a cross - section through the same potential .",
    "both figures are schematic and shaded regions indicate electron occupation .",
    "these figures illustrate that as a saw minimum approaches the entrance to the q1dc , the saw potential trough narrows and becomes a quantum dot .",
    "the size of this quantum dot implies that , at the point that it forms , it will be occupied by many electrons .",
    "as it shrinks in passing through the q1dc , electrons will be forced out .",
    "electrons that are left in the dot are taken far from equilibrium with the source and drain reservoirs as they pass across the q1dc .",
    "the distances and barrier heights between adjacent quantum dots are sufficiently large that the dots in the q1dc can be considered to be independent as far as quantum - mechanical tunneling is concerned .    from a classical perspective",
    ", the electrons that are most likely to be captured and transported through the q1dc by the saw will be those that are least energetic in the rest frame of the saw .",
    "quantum mechanically , the saw minima will contain electrons in localised states and the saw would not be expected to eject these electrons in favour of capturing those in higher energy states .",
    "this is borne out by classical simulations and by evaluations of the 1d single - particle time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "figure  [ wavefns ] illustrates the quantum - mechanical capture process by showing the evolution of the wave functions of the first three bound states of a saw minimum as it approaches and then passes through a q1dc .",
    "the potential in fig .",
    "[ wavefns ] was chosen so that the mean current would correspond to the transport of 1.5 electrons per cycle .",
    "it can be seen in the upper sequence that the lowest state is simply carried along with the traveling saw , even through the q1dc .",
    "however , the second state is partially reflected as it arrives at the q1dc and the third state is completely rejected .",
    "all higher energy states , including those that are delocalised in the bulk 2deg region , are also reflected .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction is important in the capture process because as quantum dots form and are brought to the fermi energy , the screening between their trapped electrons is reduced . once above the fermi energy",
    "this screening appears only as an image charge in the 2deg .",
    "the coulomb interaction will therefore control the form of the time - dependent wave functions , the state energies , and ultimately the number of electrons left in a dot as it passes through the q1dc .    quantum - mechanical decoherence is relevant to the capture and escape processes because it determines whether there is an integer number of electrons trapped in the dot or not , and it affects the quantum states of these electrons . if at some instant the energy of one of the electrons in a particular dot is too large for it to be contained by that dot - or large enough that tunneling becomes important - then the wave function of this electron will start to leak out of that dot .",
    "an electron which is in the process of leaving will initially propagate over the adjacent 2deg maintaining coherence with the electrons left in the dot and will then lose this coherence as it interacts with conduction electrons .",
    "the decoherence will determine whether the electron leaves and will cause the dot to be left in a mixed state . as more and more electrons",
    "escape it is probable that the density matrix of the dot will become increasingly diagonal .",
    "for the case where finally only a single electron remains in the dot this would mean that its density matrix would simply be a half and half mixture of spin up and spin down .",
    "such a mixed state is not suitable for quantum computation .      for quantum computation",
    "it is necessary to provide electrons in pure states and this can be achieved by applying an external magnetic field to our device .",
    "the simple application of an external magnetic field to an @xmath0 particle mixed state does not cause it to become a pure state unless it has time to relax by emitting phonons or photons : the field merely precesses the spin of each electron .",
    "however , it has a significant effect on which electrons are captured from the 2deg by the saw @xcite .",
    "the application of an external magnetic field polarises the electrons in the source 2deg so that the low energy electrons all have the same spin .",
    "the lande g - factor in gaas is 0.44 and the amplitude of the saw electrostatic potential is estimated from experiments to be approximately 1mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the application of a magnetic field with strength @xmath61 t would ensure that all electrons captured would have the same spin .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ captureb ] .",
    "once the split - gate voltage is increased to the point where only one electron is captured per cycle these electrons will be in pure spin states even though their orbital motion may be mixed .",
    "these electrons can therefore be used as spin qubits .    in principle a large number of such qubits may be prepared simultaneously using this method by patterning large numbers of parallel q1dcs with surface gates  @xcite or by etching .",
    "a quantum circuit consists of devices performing two kinds of operation on qubits .",
    "the first , the single qubit operation , acts to rotate the spin of a single qubit about an arbitrary direction in space .",
    "the second , the two qubit operation , entangles the spin wave functions of two adjacent qubits by altering the exchange coupling between them .",
    "a gate which produces such entanglement and is easy to produce within our scheme is the `` square root of swap '' gate @xcite .",
    "we can perform a single qubit operation on a saw spin qubit by having it pass through the magnetic field from a local static magnet . during the time a qubit is in the field ,",
    "its wave function will evolve according to the zeeman term in schrdinger s equation @xmath7   \\left [ \\matrix{\\alpha \\cr            \\beta } \\right ]    = i { \\partial \\over \\partial t }   \\left [ \\matrix{\\alpha \\cr            \\beta } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and the qubit wave function has the form ; @xmath9 for a constant external magnetic field this evolution is a precession of the qubit spin about the direction of the field .    in principle , a local static magnet with a magnetic field that points in an arbitrary direction can be provided by a magnetic force microscope or by controlled ion beam deposition of a ferromagnetic material . however , for universal computation it is only necessary to make single qubit rotations about two independent axes and therefore it is sufficient to provide local magnetic fields that point in two orthogonal directions . as we have mentioned above , in order to provide pure states for the input , the device must be placed in an external field .",
    "this field may be used for one of the directions , and could be screened in regions where it is not needed by a superconducting material such as niobium .",
    "the magnetic field for the other direction can be provided by a local magnetic split gate such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ onequbit ] .",
    "if this is fabricated as a split ring , then stray fields will be reduced .",
    "a material such as permalloy could be used since it has a large surface magnetisation ( @xmath61 t ) and exhibits shape anisotropy @xcite which can be exploited in setting the direction of the magnetisation .",
    "if the application of a global external magnetic field proved to be inconvenient for a particular circuit design , the input magnetic field and both directions of magnetic field for single qubit operations could be provided by magnetic surface gates .",
    "figures [ rab]a , b show how a qubit spin will precess as it passes through a magnetic split gate .",
    "they are calculated from the zeeman contribution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation eqn  1 . for these figures ,",
    "a constant field @xmath10 has been applied and a local field @xmath11 is switched on for a short time , representing the passage of a qubit through a magnetic split gate . in the regions where @xmath12",
    "the external field @xmath10 causes the spin to precess around the @xmath13 axis without altering its component in this direction , so that @xmath14 . in the region where @xmath15 this ratio oscillates at the rabi frequency .",
    "these figures show that it is possible to shift the phase of the qubit components independently by altering the length of channel exposed to the external constant field , and to vary the relative amplitudes of the qubit components by varying the length of the magnetic gate .",
    "a surface gate of length @xmath6220 nm with a surface field of @xmath16 t will produce a @xmath17 rotation on a passing qubit spin .",
    "a two qubit operation can be achieved with surface patterning which causes two adjacent qubits , captured in the same saw minimum , to be forced into tunnel contact .",
    "suitable gate patterning is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ twoqubit ] .",
    "it consists of etched trenches defining an ` x shape ' with a central metallic surface gate which splits this shape into two channels when a negative bias is applied to it .",
    "the tunneling coefficient between adjacent dots is fully controllable using the bias on the central surface gate . for a low bias ,",
    "the tunneling coefficient is essentially unity , and at a large negative bias it will be zero . for",
    "a finite transmission coefficient the wave functions of the two electrons in the two dots entangle via tunneling and the coulomb interaction and then decouple leaving just one electron in each quantum dot .",
    "this represents a two - particle unitary transformation on the initial qubit states of the trapped electrons .",
    "a number of models for a two - qubit gate made from two coupled quantum dots are given in  @xcite .",
    "these models also apply to the two - qubit gate described above . here",
    ", we discuss the basic operation of this gate in terms of the hubbard model .",
    "this model incorporates the possibility for double occupation of a single dot which we discuss later in the section on readout gates .",
    "the electrons in the channels shown in fig .",
    "[ twoqubit ] are sufficiently separated that they can not tunnel between wells in the direction of propagation of the saw .",
    "away from the central tunnelling region , the wave functions in the upper and lower channels will be spin qubits of the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the indices @xmath21 refer to the upper and lower channels respectively .",
    "the corresponding two - particle wave function will have the form ; @xmath22 where @xmath23 the operator @xmath24 creates an electron in dot @xmath25 with spin @xmath26 from the empty state @xmath27 . in the region where the two qubits entangle , we consider two extra states which represent the possibility for double occupation of one of the dots .",
    "@xmath28 assuming that the electrons on each dot are tightly bound so that weak tunneling is permitted between adjacent dots in the same saw minimum , and assuming an on site coulomb interaction , the time dependent schrdinger equation takes the form : @xmath29   \\left [ \\matrix{\\chi_1 \\cr            \\chi_2 \\cr            \\chi_3 \\cr            \\chi_4 \\cr            \\chi_5 \\cr            \\chi_6 } \\right ]    = i { \\partial \\over \\partial t }   \\left[\\matrix{\\chi_1 \\cr            \\chi_2 \\cr            \\chi_3 \\cr            \\chi_4 \\cr            \\chi_5 \\cr            \\chi_6 } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the on site coulomb energy , @xmath31 is the zeeman energy and @xmath32 is the single - particle tunneling energy between the two dots .",
    "the form of this hamiltonian indicates that the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 evolve independently and are unaffected by the narrow tunnel barrier in the central region of the gate .",
    "this derives from the fact that two - particle tunneling between dots necessarily involves double occupation .",
    "since the two electrons in these states have the same spin double occupation is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle and therefore no tunneling can occur .",
    "this assumes that there are no other single - particle states which can be occupied .",
    "the remaining part of the hamiltonian has four eigenvalues of the form : @xmath35 for @xmath30 and @xmath32 constant this implies that the dynamics of the system consist of a ` slow ' oscillation at the exchange frequency @xmath36 between states @xmath37 and @xmath38 , via the double occupation states @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and a ` fast ' oscillation of states @xmath39 and @xmath40 of frequency @xmath30 .",

    "root of swap is the square root of this unitary transformation . for this figure ,",
    "the coulomb energy @xmath30 has been set to be much larger than the exchange energy @xmath36 and this has resulted in low occupation probabilities for the double occupation states @xmath45 .",
    "this is desirable for quantum computation since these states are not qubit states and their occupation results in a form of decoherence since only the qubit states are measured at the end of the computation .",
    "for @xmath46 the time for a swap operation will be approximately @xmath47ns .",
    "since the saw travels at 2700ms@xmath4 this would correspond to a gate length @xmath48550 nm .",
    "the exchange energy @xmath36 depends on the tunneling probability across the central barrier region and it can therefore be set to have any value .",
    "however , using such a low value would need to be weighed against the possibility for a potential modulation of the order @xmath36 in the central gate region and the necessity for the temperature to be sufficiently low .",
    "a practical design would have as large a value for @xmath36 as possible , the restrictions being the smallest length of gate which could be made and the need to maximize @xmath30 to prevent double occupation .",
    "the single and two - qubit gates we have described constitute the only two gates necessary for the construction of universal logic in a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "these two gates can be used to construct the quantum c - not operation @xcite , a useful building block in quantum computer designs ( e.g. see ref  @xcite ) . in terms of our gate patterning , the c - not operation has the form ; @xmath49 the gate patterning necessary to produce this is shown in fig .",
    "the ` horse - shoe ' gates in the figure are used to indicate the necessity for screening stray fields from magnetic gates .",
    "this may can also be achieved by using a superconducting material such as niobium .      a schematic diagram of a quantum gate network is shown in fig .  [ network ] .",

    "each q1dc has single - qubit gates placed along its length and pairs of q1dcs are coupled by two - qubit gates .",

    "a single computation is performed by each saw minimum as it passes across the network dragging a set of @xmath0 qubits along with it .",

    "each qubit passes into a separate readout gate which has two outputs arranged such that the ratio of the currents passing into them reflects the relative spin along a particular direction .",
    "the saw performs @xmath50 computations per second and each calculation contributes to produce a measurable output current .",
    "many proposals for quantum computers rely on single electron transistors for reading the state of the output qubits  @xcite .",
    "such techniques are also possible here and would be necessary if for a particular algorithm the output from individual computations was needed . with our device design though we can also construct readout gates which measure the ratio @xmath51 for the qubits passing out of each q1dc .",
    "the brackets indicate an average of the qubit spin components over @xmath52 quantum computations per second .",
    "since each computation from each saw minimum is nominally identical in our scheme , this ratio should be the same as that for the individual qubits exiting from each q1dc .",
    "such averaging may even compensate for decoherence and errors from random events in a given network .",
    "we present three ways for measuring these averages here .",
    "the simplest readout idea conceptually is to use the spin - valve effect to measure the orientation of each output qubit using ferromagnetic ohmic contacts @xcite .",
    "figure  [ read1 ] shows a specific design .",
    "the two ohmic contacts are ferromagnetic and have magnetisations pointing in opposite directions so that they have different resistances to the two spin components of incoming qubits . if the total width of these ohmic contacts is made less that the spin coherence length this should result in the currents which flow through them to ground reflecting the spin orientation of the output qubits .",
    "such a readout gate could be calibrated using a set of qubits of known orientation .",

    "there is a gold surface gate to produce an adjustable tunnel barrier between the upper and lower channels .",
    "this enables entanglement of incoming qubit wave functions .",
    "if the test qubit has the same spin orientation as the unknown qubit then no tunneling will occur between the two channels in the central region and the two incoming electrons will simply pass into ohmic contacts a and b. however , if they have opposite spin , tunneling can occur and there is a finite probability that the exiting dots will be doubly occupied ( see fig  [ hubbl ] ) either in the upper or lower channel . the gate is designed so that if this occurs one of these electrons can further tunnel across a narrow barrier to ohmic contact c. thus the ratio of the currents passing into a , b and c will reflect the spin of the unknown electron relative to that of the known test electron .",

    "since the two - qubit gate in our scheme relies on tunneling between adjacent quantum dots , this may also prove to be a limitation on our design .",
    "however , since the majority of these phonons will be of very long wavelength , it should be possible to reduce their effect by placing the device in a suitable cavity @xcite .",
    "the presence of radio frequency photons from the microwave signal used to generate the saw can be significantly reduced by issolating the device with suitable screening . since the radio frequency used in experiments with saws has a wavelength of approximately 10 cm a cavity much smaller than this would work well .",
    "if the electron spins couple to the nuclear spins of the host crystal , then this provides an additional mechanism for decoherence .",
    "such coupling has been observed in gaas systems @xcite and its effect on double quantum dots has been described theoretically in @xcite .",
    "we have suggested a way in which saw devices can be used for quantum computation .",
    "the idea involves the capture of electrons in pure spin states from a 2deg by a saw to form qubits .",
    "single - qubit operations are performed using local magnetic fields produced by magnetic surface gate patterning .",
    "two - qubit operations are performed by allowing exchange coupling between qubits through a controllable tunnel barrier . a quantum computation with one of these devices would consist of a single saw minimum dragging a line of @xmath0 qubits through a patterned array of single and two qubit gates .",
    "each saw minimum would perform the same computation .",
    "a number of different schemes for reading out the final state of qubits have been proposed : magnetic ohmic contacts ; double occupation in two - qubit gates ; and the stern - gerlach effect . the major problem problem for this kind of implementation will be decoherence arising from coupling with : other electrons ; radio frequency photons ; phonons ; and nuclear spins .",
    "however , these problems are generic to any semiconductor quantum computation proposal and we believe that the repetition ( three billion time per second ) which our implementation allows could be exploited to counteract these problems .    _ acknowledgements : _ we are grateful to c.  j.  b.  ford , d.  p.   divincenzo , d.  loss , g.  milburn and g.  burkard for instructive discussions and encouragement in this work .",
