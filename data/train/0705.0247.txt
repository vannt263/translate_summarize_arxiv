    "abel - tranform s philosophy was introduced by abel in its pionneer article on integrals of rational forms on algebraic curves .",
    "he considered sums of such integrals depending on @xmath2-cycles given by the intersection of the given curve @xmath3 with a rational family of algebraic curves @xmath4 and made the fundamental discovery that such sums can be expressed in terms of rational and logarithmic functions of the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "if we suppose that @xmath3 is a curve in @xmath6 and @xmath7 are lines of @xmath6 ( so that @xmath8 ) , then abel s theorem can be rephrased as follow .",

    "for any rational @xmath13-form @xmath14 on @xmath3 , the current @xmath15 coincides with a rational @xmath13-form on @xmath16 .",
    "the original proof of abel deals with more general curves than lines .",
    "we state it for lines for simplicity , since the proof is immediate in both cases with the modern language of currents .",
    "the map @xmath17 on currents is well - defined since @xmath11 is a submersion and @xmath12 is proper .",

    "latter on , henkin and passare ( @xcite , 1999 ) established the link with multidimensional residue theory , in particular the modern formalism of residue currents , and proved in @xcite a stronger local version of the abel - inverse theorem which holds for any dimension and for analytic subset @xmath35 of any pure dimension @xmath36 in an open neighborhood @xmath26 of a @xmath37-linear subspace , and for @xmath14 a meromorphic @xmath36-form on @xmath3 .",

    "this article has been motivated by the previously mentionned result of fabre and by results of @xcite , where the author relates the inversion mechanisms to a rigidity propriety of a certain system of pde s to give finally a stronger form of the classical abel - inverse theorem .",
    "when @xmath40 , most of complete toric varieties are not projective , so that we can not _ a priori _ deduce the toric abel - inverse theorem ( theorem  [ t3.2 ] ) from the classical one @xcite when @xmath41 .",
