    "the nature of the dark matter in the universe is unknown .",
    "the only direct detections to date have been of massive baryonic halo objects , machos ( paczyski 1986 ) , via gravitational microlensing of lmc and smc stars .",
    "the implications of the microlensing experiments are controversial , since of the @xmath1 events detected , the 3 events with distance determinations are attributable to star - star lensing ( 2 , and the only smc events , in the smc , 1 in the lmc ) . since the smc is very extended along the line of sight , one must wait for more data to draw any definitive conclusions about macho location . in the case of the lmc",
    ", the distribution of timescales for the events suggests that we should be seeing some halo events .",
    "if this is the case , up to half of the halo dark matter consists of machos of mean mass @xmath2    to improve the situation , one must measure many more microlensing events .",
    "this can be accomplished by constructing much larger cameras and using large telescopes .",
    "however there is a complementary strategy that allows us to optimize the microlensing yields and that can potentially increase by a factor of two or more the number of detectable macho events .",
    "this is the technique of pixel microlensing ( crotts 1992 ; baillon et al . 1993 ) .",
    "pixel microlensing works as follows .",
    "individual stars are not resolved .",
    "nevertheless a microlensing event is detectable as a pixel brightening .",
    "one can observe with many stars per pixel and thereby allow pixel microlensing to provide a powerful means of accumulating events .",
    "in fact , pixel microlensing allows us to use gravitational microlensing to learn about galactic halos even when individual stars are not resolved .",
    "the high magnifications required have made it difficult to determine the physical parameters of the source  lens system .",
    "for example , by observing high magnification events it has not hitherto been possible to extract such parameters of the source  lens system as the optical depth .",
    "recently , it has been shown ( gondolo 1999 ) that using the flux  weighted full width at half maximum of the pixel microlensing lightcurve , one can extract the optical depth .",
    "this motivates us to further explore the theory of lensing in terms of this and related timescales .",
    "we first define some standard notation .",
    "the source star being lensed lies a distance @xmath3 from the observer , and the lens itself lies at a distance @xmath4 , thus @xmath5 .",
    "the einstein radius is the radius of the einstein ring of a massive object of mass @xmath6 . the einstein radius and its projected angular size",
    "are given by @xmath7 considering the einstein radius as a function of @xmath8 , a tube from the source to the observer is traced out .",
    "it is widest at @xmath9 , and its width goes to zero as @xmath10 or @xmath11 as @xmath8 goes to zero or one , respectively .",
    "this is the so - called `` microlensing tube '' .",
    "a lens that passes inside its own microlensing tube produces a lensing event .",
    "the einstein time is the time that a lens would take to cross the full einstein disk if it were to pass through the center , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lens velocity transverse to the line of sight .",
    "the flux increase in a microlensing event is given by the well known formula ( einstein 1936 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the perpendicular distance from the the lens to the line of sight , in units of the einstein radius @xmath16 .",
    "we assume linear motion for the lens , and a minimum impact parameter @xmath17 , giving @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "it is useful to note that when @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "this is the so - called high magnification regime .",
    "the optical depth to microlensing is a commonly used quantity .",
    "it is defined as the number of lenses that are within the microlensing tube for a given source . with this definition , the optical depth",
    "is clearly given by @xmath22 measurement of the optical depth in a microlensing survey provides a weighted column density of lenses , and can be used to estimate the total mass in lenses in galactic halos .",
    "it is straightforward to show ( gondolo 1999 ) that the full - width at half maximum of a microlensing event is given by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 we find the useful limiting values @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for classical lensing , where the threshold is usually taken to be the einstein radius",
    ", we will need @xmath27 .",
    "the optical depth estimator involves determining the flux  weighted timescale @xmath28 . in the regime of high magnifications , required by pixel microlensing experiments , @xmath29 ,",
    "giving @xmath30 .",
    "we use flux to indicate a ( dimensionless ) number of photons per observation .",
    "this is simply the number of photons collected in one image of the target .",
    "the excess flux is then the number of photons in one image above the background .",
    "we now would like to derive an expression for the differential microlensing rate in terms of the timescales that can be easily measured from pixel lensing data .",
    "we have two choices , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "recall that it is very difficult to determine the einstein time for a pixel event . for a rate determination alone ,",
    "the timescale @xmath31 is usually more useful than the timescale @xmath32 .",
    "it is precisely the full - width at half maximum timescale of an event that determines if it can be well sampled by a given observing strategy .",
    "the overall flux comes in to the calculation in determining if a given event can be detected above some noise level .",
    "if we were to compute the event rates as a function of @xmath32 , the sample strategy and photometry are tied together in a more complicated way .",
    "we thus advocate quoting the event rate distribution in @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 , even though it is the timescale @xmath32 which is useful in determining the optical depth from a pixel lensing dataset .",
    "the event rate is then denoted @xmath33 .",
    "this is the differential rate of microlensing events at a given timescale @xmath31 .",
    "we modify the rate derivation of griest ( 1991 ) to accommodate the new timescales .",
    "the differential rate at which lenses enter the microlensing tube is given by @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the velocity of the microlensing tube in the rest frame of the galactic halos .",
    "the tube can move because the source and observer are in general moving in the galactic rest frame .",
    "we define @xmath36 as the transverse velocity of the lens and @xmath37 as the angle the transverse velocity makes with the velocity of the microlensing tube @xmath35 .",
    "we quote the impact parameter @xmath17 in units of the einstein radius .",
    "we will integrate @xmath17 from zero to some maximum value , which means we need the factor of two .",
    "we assume that the distribution function @xmath38 is maxwellian , with dispersion velocity @xmath39 .",
    "the distribution function in the microlensing tube frame is @xmath40.\\ ] ] we see that @xmath41 , and we can do the integrals in @xmath42 and @xmath37 easily , giving @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here , @xmath46 is a modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "we further define @xmath47 , thus @xmath48 .",
    "previously , this expression has been used to get the rate distribution with einstein time ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) . the variable @xmath17 is trivially integrated to some threshold @xmath49 , and we change variables from @xmath13 to @xmath50 .",
    "this gives the following , @xmath51 \\tilde{i}_0\\left(\\frac{4r_e(x)\\eta(x)}{v_ct_e}\\right).\\ ] ] to compute the rate distribution in @xmath31 , we instead change variables from @xmath17 to @xmath31 , @xmath52 .",
    "the transformation is inverted to obtain @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the final theoretical rate , subject to some threshold to be determined later , is then @xmath54 ^ 2}\\tilde{i}_0[2\\eta(x)v ] \\left\\{w'\\left[w^{-1}\\left(\\frac{v_c{t_{\\rm fwhm}}}{2r_e(x)}v\\right)\\right ] \\right\\}^{-1}. \\label{eq : rate}\\ ] ] if we instead had changed variables from @xmath13 to @xmath31 , we would have obtained a double integral in @xmath17 and @xmath8 , with identical functional form in the limit of small @xmath17 .",
    "we choose to integrate in @xmath13 and @xmath8 because it is perhaps more suggestive to integrate over the velocity distribution of lenses , then along the line of sight .",
    "we now must account for the fact that not all events are detectable .",
    "the first difficulty is that there must be some minimum of additional flux detected so that the event is distinguishable from noise .",
    "the simplest way to do this is the so - called `` peak threshold '' .",
    "this is the prescription that an event must have some fixed maximum amplification for it to be detectable .",
    "effectively , we demand that the signal to noise of the measurement at peak magnification be higher than some threshold .",
    "we assume that electrons in the ccd are collected at a rate @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the apparent magnitude in some band , and we assume an integration time @xmath57 .",
    "the signal to noise of the highest magnification sample is thus @xmath58 where @xmath56 is the apparent magnitude of the unresolved lensed star and @xmath59 is the apparent magnitude of the unlensed galaxy light on the pixel .",
    "we see that a given signal to noise requires some minimum value of @xmath60 , which corresponds to a maximum impact parameter , @xmath49 .",
    "this gives an upper bound on @xmath13 , as we will see .",
    "fixing all variables except @xmath13 and @xmath17 , we find that @xmath13 is monotonic in @xmath17 , thus we arrive at an upper bound on @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath61    to improve the peak threshold trigger , we can use the signal to noise in the three highest points of the lightcurve .",
    "we will assume that the middle sample is on the peak , and that the samples are a time @xmath62 apart .",
    "the significance of the value @xmath63 is that the observing program is engaged in on  source integration a fraction @xmath64 of the time .",
    "the side samples are then taken at times @xmath62 off of the peak . the signal to noise as measured this way",
    "is given by @xmath65.\\ ] ] this expression for @xmath66 is monotonic in @xmath17 , and can be inverted to determine a maximum impact parameter as before .",
    "this maximum impact parameter then gives the maximum velocity .",
    "a more sophisticated way to account for the detection of an event is the so - called `` event threshold '' ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "the signal to noise in one sample is given by @xmath67 the total signal to noise for the event is thus given by @xmath68 in converting the sum to an integral , we need to include the factor @xmath63 for the observation spacing , since the telescope does not integrate continuously . this factor is neglected in previous work ( gould 1995 ) , resulting in overestimates of rates by a factor of three or more . following gould , we find @xmath69 the correction function @xmath70 can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals with _",
    "parameter _ @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds , respectively .",
    "note that some authors define @xmath73 and @xmath74 as functions of the _ modulus _ @xmath75 , with @xmath76 .",
    "the limiting behavior of this function is given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath79 , the leading order expansion is accurate to @xmath80 : @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "we find that when fixing all variables except @xmath13 , @xmath82 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "thus if we impose a threshold signal to noise for detection , @xmath83 , we find that @xmath84 . as a final point ,",
    "in the event threshold case @xmath66 is also monotonic in @xmath17 , all other variables being fixed .",
    "this means that we can translate the maximum velocity into a maximum impact parameter , @xmath85 in practice it is quite difficult to implement the event threshold trigger because of non - poissonian errors in the background estimation ( gondolo 1998 ) .",
    "using this formalism is more appropriate for space - based observations , which have much more easily characterized errors .",
    "we must now consider the effects of the finite sizes of the source stars .",
    "the microlensing formulas assume that the lens and the source are pointlike , but this is obviously not the case .",
    "the source star has a non - zero radius .",
    "the nature of the lens is a priori unknown , but the finite lens radius is unimportant for most possibilities .",
    "the maximum amplification of an extended source assumed to be uniform can be determined by integrating the magnification over the disk of the star .",
    "the result is @xmath86 where the @xmath87 s are projected angular sizes of the einstein ring and the source star , respectively .",
    "following gould ( 1995 ) , we take the radius of a star of @xmath881.0 , 0.5 , 0.0 , ... -3.0 to be @xmath89 7 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 23 , 33 , 46 , 64 , and 90 .",
    "such bright red stars are predominantly giants .",
    "the maximum amplification of a given star is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath8 . in the peak threshold case",
    ", we require that an event has a minimum amplification @xmath90 , which corresponds to maximum value of @xmath8 where @xmath91 , @xmath92^{-1}.\\ ] ] this is easily accounted for the the rate integral .    in the event threshold case",
    ", we could take the approach that there is a minimum amplification as in the peak threshold case .",
    "however , we choose to take a very conservative approach .",
    "we demand that for an event to be detectable , the lens must not pass in front of the disk of the star .",
    "this imposes a minimum value of the impact parameter @xmath93 .",
    "fixing all other variables , this imposes a minimum velocity , @xmath94 in summary , the peak threshold formalism imposes a maximum value of @xmath8 and a maximum value of @xmath13 on eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] , while the event threshold imposes both a minimum and maximum value of @xmath13 on eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] .    to get a better feel for the meaning of these results , we compare the bounds on the velocity integral for the peak threshold and event threshold triggers in the regime where we require high magnifications .",
    "in other words , we can assume that @xmath29 and @xmath95 .",
    "we will assume that we want @xmath96 .",
    "thus , in the peak threshold case , we find @xmath97 similarly , in the event threshold case we find @xmath98 for comparison , we form the ratio of these maximum velocities , @xmath99 in the limit where the event is well sampled , @xmath100 , it is clear that the event threshold prescription allows the detection of many more events because the experiment is sensitive to higher velocity lenses .    now that we have derived the microlensing rate for a single star with magnitude @xmath56 which falls on a pixel of magnitude @xmath59 ,",
    "we need to integrate over the luminosity function of the pixel in order to get the total rate of pixel lensing events .",
    "we assume that we know the normalized luminosity function of the pixel , @xmath101 , in units of stars per unit magnitude .",
    "the total microlensing rate is then simply @xmath102 for clarity , we now write the total microlensing rate in both the peak threshold and event threshold formalisms , @xmath103 ^ 2}\\tilde{i}_0[2\\eta(x)v ] \\left\\{w'\\left[w^{-1}\\left(\\frac{v_c{t_{\\rm fwhm}}}{2r_e(x)}v\\right)\\right ] \\right\\}^{-1 } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "however , it is more difficult to interpret the experimental meaning of @xmath32 , and it is probably more useful to use the timescale @xmath31 in discussing pixel microlensing rates .",
    "of course , the physical meaning of @xmath32 is more clear : in the high magnification regime , it is just proportional to the absolute flux of the source star times the einstein time , with no dependence on the impact parameter .",
    "the flux  weighted full - width at half maximum timescale of an event can be used to determine the optical depth .",
    "we are still interested , however , in the physical parameters of the source  lens system , encoded in the einstein time .",
    "the difficulty in pixel microlensing is that the shape of the lightcurve does not easily allow the determination of the einstein time at high magnifications .",
    "in fact , shape alone is not a good indicator of the einstein time even with small magnifications ( gould 1996 ; woniak & paczyski 1997 ) . in microlensing with resolved stars ,",
    "there is extra information in that the flux of the source star is measurable .    with the estimator of gondolo in mind",
    ", we have a situation different than that of previous work .",
    "we can measure the optical depth to microlensing with no knowledge of the einstein time .",
    "this already gives us a great deal of information about the macho population in a galaxy . with this information in hand ,",
    "we can attempt to determine the einstein times for some subset of the data which has high signal to noise .    in the high magnification regime , we see that @xmath112 , giving the shape of the lightcurve @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the background and @xmath115 is the flux of the unlensed star . at high magnifications , we see that even several times @xmath31 off of the peak , the magnification is well characterized by @xmath112 . in this regime",
    "we can only measure the quantities @xmath116 and @xmath117 .    in order to measure the three parameters @xmath115 , @xmath17 , and @xmath50 separately ,",
    "we need to observe the deviations from @xmath118 .",
    "gould ( 1996 ) has shown that this is possible with pixel lensing data with signal to noise @xmath119 . to next order in @xmath120 ,",
    "the lightcurve is @xmath121 this form contains both @xmath116 and @xmath122 , breaking the degeneracy .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath122 term is quite small , requiring a high signal to noise to obtain a robust fit , as gould describes .",
    "we describe a new method for measuring the three degenerate parameters in pixel lensing data using another timescale that can in principle be directly measured from pixel microlensing data .",
    "this is the standard deviation ( in time ) of @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "we define this statistical timescale as follows , @xmath124 we can evaluate @xmath125 in terms of complete elliptic integrals , @xmath126^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds as functions of the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "we find the limiting behavior @xmath129 , @xmath130^{-1/2}$ ] , and @xmath131=0.778 for events tangent to the einstein ring .",
    "we now see the utility of @xmath132 . at high magnifications ,",
    "corresponding to small @xmath17 , the functional forms of @xmath31 and @xmath132 are quite different .",
    "if we form the ratio @xmath133 , the einstein times cancel , and we are left purely with a function of @xmath17 . thus , if we could measure both @xmath31 and @xmath132 for an event , we could measure @xmath17 , and thus the magnification and the einstein time .",
    "we find that @xmath134 in the high magnification regime .",
    "in other words , the tails of the lightcurve are very wide .",
    "this raises the question of how well @xmath132 can be measured .",
    "it turns out that @xmath132 can not be measured without extending to hundreds of times @xmath31 in the monitoring program .",
    "however , we can modify this timescale to make it useful . for a given event",
    ", we assume that the lightcurve is measured in the interval @xmath135 .",
    "we choose to truncate the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ts ] ) at these multiples of @xmath31 , for each event . in other words",
    ", we measure @xmath31 for an event , then we compute the second moment , truncating the integrals .",
    "this defines a new timescale , which we denote the truncated statistical timescale , @xmath136 the function @xmath137 is given by @xmath138}{x_n(f_n-1)+[(2+\\beta^2)f(\\phi_n|m)- ( 4+\\beta^2)e(\\phi_n|m)]/\\sqrt{4+\\beta^2}}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath139 , @xmath140^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath141 .",

    "for the full event , with data in the range @xmath135 , we can use the previous formula , and simply duplicate each term in the numerator and denominator replacing @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "the real focus of this method is the following . in pixel microlensing , it is easy to measure the width of the peak , @xmath31 .",
    "events with the same @xmath31 have drastically different magnifications .",
    "our method attempts to measure the width of the tails of the event , @xmath132 , which breaks the degeneracy seen in @xmath31 . in effect",
    ", @xmath31 sets the overall timescale of the event , while @xmath132 splits the degeneracy in events of a given timescale .",
    "it is the comparison of the two widths , the scaling of one in terms of the other , which allows us to determine the physical parameters of the source  lens system .",
    "the truncated statistical timescale offers another piece of information about a microlensing event . because it is only a moment of the lightcurve",
    ", we can hope to be able to measure it with some accuracy . to illustrate the application of this method",
    ", we form the appropriate ratio , @xmath144 , and plot versus @xmath17 for @xmath145 in figure [ fig : tsigma ] .",
    "note that @xmath146 is the idealized case , giving @xmath133 . for @xmath147 ,",
    "the ratio varies by a factor of more than three between magnifications of a few and magnifications of a hundred . a reasonably good measurement of the ratio can thus give a crude measurement of the true magnification .",
    "to illustrate these results we specialize to the case of m87 , a giant elliptical in the virgo cluster .",
    "we take the distance modulus to virgo to be @xmath148 .",
    "we use the @xmath149-band luminosity function of terndrup et al . ,",
    "measured for the bulge of the milky way .",

    "these correspond to @xmath151 in the range @xmath152 .",

    "the rate distributions for @xmath163 are plotted for wfpc2 , ac , and ngst in figure [ fig : peak ] .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath164 is required for detection .",
    "notice that most observable events are quite short .",
    "we also plot the event rates for the advanced camera with @xmath165 , appropriate for attempting to determine the einstein time of individual events .    in figure",
    "[ fig : peak3 ] we plot event rates using the improved peak threshold trigger , assuming that we make one observation per day . for comparison",
    ", we present the rates for the advanced camera assuming that we make four equally spaced observations in one day . using the three highest samples in the lightcurve to define an event , we find significantly improved detection rates for timescales longer than the spacing of the observations .",
    "we plot the same four sets of rates using the event threshold trigger in figure [ fig : event ] .",
    "again , we notice a significantly enhanced rate of observable events with timescales longer than the spacing between observations .",
    "microlensing can also occur when the lens itself is also a star .",
    "the rates for star ",
    "star lensing are computed in much the same way .",
    "we assume that a typical star has a mass of @xmath166 ( gould , bahcall , & flynn 1996 ) , and that the stars are in an isothermal distribution , with a core radius of 2 kpc . the total mass in stars for m87 is taken to be the same as the total dark mass of the milky way .",
    "it is possible that there are a great number of brown dwarfs in stellar systems .",
    "we also consider the case where the typical star mass is 0.05 @xmath167 , indicating that most of the mass in stars is in brown dwarfs . in figure",
    "[ fig : starstar ] , we plot these event rates in four cases , all with the improved peak threshold trigger .    the andromeda galaxy , m31 , has been the subject of several ground  based pixel microlensing surveys ( crotts 1992 ; crotts & tomaney 1996 ; tomaney & crotts 1996 ; baillon et al . 1993 ; ansari et al .",
    "this galaxy is a somewhat peculiar target for a microlensing survey .",
    "the disk of the galaxy is sharply inclined , only 12.5@xmath168 from edge - on . because most microlensed stars lie in the disk",
    ", there is a definite bias in the distance to the lensed star .",
    "there will be a noticeably higher optical depth to stars on the far side of the disk .",
    "we take the m31 halo to be identical to the milky way halo previously described , except that it is twice as massive . in figure",
    "[ fig : contour ] , we show contours of constant optical depth to the m31 disk .",
    "the isophotes are taken from hodge $ kennicutt ( 1982 ) . the change in optical depth from the near to far edge",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "we now compute event rates for this galaxy .",
    "we take the distance modulus of @xmath169 .",
    "this smaller distance modulus allows us to observe pixel microlensing from a ground based observatory .",
    "the cfht 3.6 meter telescope on mauna kea is ideal for this purpose .",
    "it has a new wide - field ccd , the cfht12k , which has 12288@xmath1708192 @xmath171 pixels , for a field of view of @xmath172 .",
    "we take a psf of @xmath173 `` super  pixels '' , making a square arc second , conservative for cfht .",
    "we assume that @xmath174 , and furthermore that the noise level is twice the photon counting noise , a level obtained by the agape collaboration ( ansari et al .",
    "we use a @xmath175-band luminosity function appropriate for the disk of a spiral galaxy ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ) .",
    "furthermore , we truncate the luminosity function at the bright end when it implies a mean of one star per super  pixel of the brightness of the pixel . this is a crude way to remove the events involving resolved stars .",
    "as before , we compute rates for the peak and improved peak threshold triggers when the sampling rate is once per day .",
    "we will assume 3600 second exposures .",
    "we center the ccd on m31 , and align its long axis along the major axis of the galaxy . in most cases",
    "we take @xmath164 , though we also compute the rates for @xmath165 with the improved peak threshold trigger .",
    "in addition , there are a large number of resolved stars in this program .",
    "we compute the rates of resolved microlensing events , assuming that a flux increase of @xmath80 is needed .",
    "the rates for cfht observations of m31 are shown in figure [ fig : m31 ] .    in figures [ fig :",
    "peak][fig : starstar ] and [ fig : m31 ] , we plot @xmath176 .",
    "this is the differential event rate for events of a specific @xmath31 . to get the total event rate",
    ", we must integrate this over the range of @xmath177 that the sampling strategy is sensitive to .",
    "roughly speaking , we can observe events with @xmath31 between about the twice the sample spacing and the total monitoring duration .",
    "we now discuss the possibility of using the statistical timescale method to determine the einstein time .",
    "we know that we will need a high signal to noise for any method to work .",
    "we specialize to the case of a pixel lensing experiment that may resolve a great number of stars , perhaps even enough for a classical microlensing survey .",
    "this is the case , for example , when using the new 12288x8192 pixel ccd on the cfht to observe m31 .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath178 , giving a substantial field of view , with a large number of resolved stars in a modest integration time . with this type of data ,",
    "the rate of high signal to noise events on unresolved stars is quite high , thus we might hope to be able to recover the einstein times of a subset of the pixel events .",
    "measuring even the truncated statistical timescale @xmath179 is quite difficult .",
    "we now investigate the real - world possibility of learning anything from this measure .",
    "we perform monte - carlo simulations of the observed @xmath179 versus the true @xmath179 to determine the errors involved in this process .",
    "we proceed as follows . for a given lightcurve in a dataset",
    ", we can easily measure @xmath31 , which also tells us to what value @xmath180 the lightcurve is well measured .",
    "we can then fit a constant background to the lightcurve and determine @xmath179 .",
    "we have the theoretical curve for @xmath179 , which lets us read off the minimum impact parameter @xmath17 , which gives us the full information on the microlensing event .",
    "we would like to know what the error in the determination of @xmath17 is . from the lightcurve",
    ", we can determine the signal to noise in the peak .",
    "we can use a monte - carlo simulation to generate events at that fixed signal to noise , for different values of beta . for each generated lightcurve , we compute @xmath179 , and thus we generate a histogram of measured values , which allows us to determine the error in the measured @xmath179 , thus an error in the measured @xmath17 .    as a concrete case , we take microlensing lightcurves with peak signal to noise @xmath165 , six times the basic detection threshold .",
    "we fix @xmath181 days , take exposures of 3600 seconds , and vary combinations of the minimum impact parameter @xmath17 , and the apparent magnitude @xmath182 that give our chosen peak signal to noise .",
    "observation are taken once per day for thirty days on either side of the maximum . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , we show generated lightcurves for these types of events . for @xmath183 and @xmath184 , we give example lightcurves with @xmath181 days , for peak signal to noise of @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 that we choose correspond to @xmath185 in the peak .",
    "the corresponding absolute @xmath175-magnitudes are @xmath186 .",
    "we now perform a monte - carlo simulation in which we generate events of these fixed parameters and measure directly the ratio @xmath187 . with these parameters , we find that the four values of @xmath17 are distinguishable at the @xmath188 level . in figure [ fig : hist ] , we plot the event histograms for these cases .",
    "for this technique to work , it is important that a good determination of the background is made .",
    "we will assume that the background is determined to @xmath188 by fitting a degenerate lightcurve .",
    "the error will be approximately the square root of the number of counts , times the factor of two to account for non - poissonian errors , and divided by the square root of the number of samples .",
    "we find that this error in the determination of the background induces an error in the determination of @xmath189 of @xmath190 , considerably smaller than the other errors .",
    "thus , the error in the background determination is negligible .",
    "the flux - weighted full - width at half maximum timescale can be used in pixel microlensing experiments to measure the optical depth .",
    "this determination does not require the almost degenerate fit to the lightcurve , as was necessary with previous methods .",
    "the optical depth is a strong indicator of the amount of mass in lenses along a line of sight . with this knowledge",
    ", we can further investigate the properties of the lenses .",
    "it is clear from figures [ fig : peak][fig : starstar],[fig : m31 ] that the shape of the timescale distribution of events depends strongly on the mass of the lenses .",
    "if a suitable population of events can be detected , it will be possible to make a rough estimate of the mass of the intervening lenses .",
    "this will serve to provide hints as to the nature of the lenses , which is unknown .",
    "for example , a large population of solar  mass lenses , inferred to be neutron stars , may be difficult to reconcile with the metallicity of the galactic gas .",
    "such a population might be assumed to be primordial black holes .",
    "a sufficiently large optical depth of any mass lens may also be difficult to reconcile with the total baryon density of the universe .",
    "in contrast , microlensing is a probe of the low  mass end of the stellar luminosity function , and may give some indication of the number and mass of brown dwarfs in galactic systems .    with a measurement of the optical depth in hand",
    ", measuring the einstein times of a subset of the lightcurves provides a great deal more information .",
    "this is a more discriminatory determination of the masses of the lensing population .",
    "even if only a small subset of events can be so analyzed , the added information is very instructive .    in conclusion",
    ", we have expanded the theory of pixel microlensing in light of the result of gondolo ( 1999 ) that a flux ",
    "weighted timescale can be used to unambiguously determine the optical depth even with moderate quality data .",
    "we have described how to compute event rates in terms of the new timescales , and applied the techniques to several proposed microlensing surveys .",
    "lastly , we have described a new method by which the einstein time can be determined from high quality data .",
    "this method is complementary to gould s ( 1996 ) method . though complicated to implement , it is perhaps conceptually simpler .",
    "the physical parameters are determined not through a lightcurve fit , but through a comparison of the widths of the peak and the tails .",
    "thanks paolo gondolo , gordon squires and tom broadhurst for useful conversations .",
    "we thank yannick giraud - hraud , jean kaplan , tod lauer , harvey richer , mike shara , and steve zepf for suggestions .",
