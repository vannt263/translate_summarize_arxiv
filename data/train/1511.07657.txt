    "biological processes involve the binding of molecules .",
    "these molecules are either soluble , i.e.  free to diffuse throughout intracellular compartments or extracellular spaces , or are anchored to membranes that surround cells or cellular compartments , to extracellular matrices , to cytoskeletal filaments , or to other subcellular structures @xcite .",
    "the anchoring to membranes is of particular importance since a large fraction of the proteins of a cell are membrane proteins @xcite .",
    "these membrane proteins are central for numerous biological processes but much less understood than soluble proteins since their structure and function is more difficult to assess in experiments @xcite .",
    "key biological processes that are mediated by the binding of membrane - anchored proteins are the adhesion of cells and the adhesion of vesicles to cells or organelles in immune responses , tissue formation , cell signaling or intracellular transport .",
    "in contrast to soluble proteins , the binding of membrane - anchored proteins poses fundamental problems that are only partially understood .",
    "these problems concern both the binding equilibrium @xcite and binding kinetics @xcite and are complicated by the fact that the binding of membrane - anchored molecules depends on the local separation of the membranes @xcite .",
    "the local separation of the membranes at the anchoring sites of apposing molecules is governed both ( i ) by the average separation @xmath0 of the membranes , which depends on the spatial position and shape of vesicles , organelles , and cells , and ( ii ) by the relative membrane roughness @xmath1 , which results from thermally excited shape fluctuations of the membranes @xcite .",
    "these shape fluctuations can be enhanced by active , atp - driven processes arising from , e.g. , the coupling of cell membranes to the cytoskeleton @xcite .        in this article , we investigate detailed data for the binding kinetics and equilibrium of membrane - anchored proteins from coarse - grained molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "we have systematically varied the average separation @xmath0 and relative roughness @xmath1 of the membranes in these simulations to determine the dependence of the binding rate constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the binding equilibrium constant @xmath4 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our investigation includes previous md data for receptor and ligand proteins with transmembrane anchors @xcite and new data for receptor and ligand proteins with lipid anchors .",
    "the transmembrane proteins and lipid - anchored proteins of our md simulations have identical ectodomains .",
    "differences in the binding equilibrium constants and binding on - rate and off - rate constants therefore result from differences in the anchoring .",
    "in addition , we present a general theory for the binding kinetics of membrane - anchored proteins that is corroborated by a comparison to our md data .",
    "this theory is based on the general theory for the binding equilibrium constant @xmath4 derived in our accompanying article @xmath5 and on a general theory for the on - rate constant @xmath2 developed in this article .",
    "the off - rate constant is then obtained from the relation @xmath6 between the rate constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the binding equilibrium constant @xmath4 of the membrane - anchored molecules . an important element of our theory is the tilt of bound receptor - ligand complexes and transition - state complexes relative to the membrane normals .",
    "this tilt results from an interplay of the anchoring energy and rotational entropy of the complexes and facilitates the formation of receptor - ligand bonds at membrane separations smaller than the preferred separation for binding .",
    "we have performed simulations of biomembrane adhesion with dissipative particle dynamics @xcite , a coarse - grained md technique that explicitly includes water and reproduces the correct hydrodynamics .",
    "coarse - grained md simulations have been widely used to investigate the self - assembly @xcite and fusion @xcite of membranes as well as the diffusion @xcite and aggregation @xcite of membrane proteins . in our simulations of biomembrane adhesion , we have considered two different types of membrane - anchored molecules : ( i ) receptors and ligands that are attached to a lipid molecule , and ( ii ) receptors and ligands with a transmembrane anchor that mimics the helix anchor of transmembrane proteins ( see fig .  1 ) . these anchored receptors and ligands are free to diffuse along the fluid membranes .",
    "the specific binding of the receptors and ligands is modeled via a distance- and angle - dependent binding potential between two interaction beads located at the tip of the molecules ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the binding potential is identical for both types of receptors and ligands and has no barrier to ensure an efficient sampling of binding and unbinding events of receptors and ligands in our simulations .",
    "the kinetics of these events is then strongly enhanced compared with protein binding events in experiments @xcite .",
    "however , this rate enhancement does not affect our main results , which concern the dependence of the rate constants and equilibrium constant on the membrane separation and roughness .",
    "the binding rate constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 and binding equilibrium constant @xmath4 can be calculated from the total numbers of binding and unbinding events observed on our simulation trajectories and from the total dwell times in the bound and unbound states of the molecules ( see appendix c ) .",
    "binding and unbinding events on our simulation trajectories can be identified from the distance between the interaction beads of the molecules .",
    "we observe up to 10000 binding and unbinding events to determine the binding rate constants with high accuracy . in our simulations ,",
    "the membranes are confined within a rectangular simulation box with size @xmath7 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "here , @xmath8 is the box extension in the direction perpendicular to the membranes , and the extensions @xmath9 specify the membrane size . for a short exemplary segment of a simulation trajectory with 15 transmembrane receptors and ligands anchored to apposing membranes of area @xmath10 nm@xmath11 . ]",
    "the average separation @xmath0 and relative roughness @xmath1 of the membranes can be varied independently in our simulations .",
    "the average membrane separation @xmath0 can be adjusted by the number of water beads between the membranes because the membranes are practically impenetrable to water beads on the simulation timescales .",
    "the relative membrane roughness @xmath1 in our simulations depends both on the size of the membranes and on the number of receptor - ligand bonds .",
    "the roughness depends on the size of the membranes because the periodic boundaries of the simulation box suppress membrane shape fluctuations with wavelength larger than @xmath12 where @xmath9 is the linear membrane size . in membrane systems with several anchored receptors and ligands ,",
    "the roughness is affected by the number of receptor - ligand bonds because the bonds constrain the membrane shape fluctuations . to calculate the relative roughness @xmath1",
    ", we divide the x - y - plane of our simulation box , which is on average parallel to the membranes , into patches @xmath13 of size @xmath14 nm@xmath11 , and determine the local separation @xmath15 of two apposing patches from the separation of the membrane midsurfaces .",
    "the roughness is then obtained as the standard deviation @xmath16 of the local separation @xmath15 from the average separation @xmath17 of the membrane midsurfaces where @xmath18 denotes the thermodynamic average .    in fig .  2 , we present simulation results for the binding equilibrium constant @xmath4 , on - rate constant @xmath2 , and off - rate constant @xmath3 of our _ lipid - anchored _ receptors and ligands .",

    "the blue data points are from simulations of membrane systems with a single receptor and single ligand anchored to apposing membranes with various areas between @xmath21 nm@xmath11 and @xmath22 nm@xmath11 ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "with increasing membrane area , the relative roughness of these membrane systems increases from @xmath19 nm for the area @xmath21 nm@xmath11 to @xmath23 nm for the area @xmath22 nm@xmath11 .",
    "the yellow data points in figs .",

    "these states differ in their relative membrane roughness since the receptor - ligand bonds constrain the membrane shape fluctuations .",
    "the green data points are obtained from simulations with 16 receptors and 16 ligands and membrane area @xmath26 nm@xmath11 , and the purple data points from simulations of our largest membrane system with 20 receptors and 20 ligands anchored to apposing membranes of area @xmath27 nm@xmath11 . finally , the red data points are from simulations with single receptors and ligands in which the membrane fluctuations are confined by membrane potentials of different strengths . in experiments ,",
    "such a situation occurs for membranes bound to apposing surfaces as , e.g. , in the surface force apparatus @xcite .    in analogy to fig .  2 , our results for membrane systems with",

    "in addition , these data illustrate that the anchoring of the receptors and ligands strongly affects @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "because our lipid - anchored and transmembrane receptor and ligand molecules have identical ectodomains , differences between the data in figs . 2 and 3 result from the different anchoring of the molecules .",

    ", we introduce a general theory for the binding kinetics that helps to understand the dependence of @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 both on the average separation and relative roughness of the membranes and on the anchoring of the receptors and ligands . in this theory , the asymmetries of the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are traced back to the tilt of the receptor - ligand and transition - state complexes relative to the membrane normals .",
    "in this section , we first consider the binding constant @xmath31 and on - rate constant @xmath32 of receptors and ligands that are anchored to two planar and parallel membranes with fixed separation @xmath33 .",
    "the local separation of such membranes is constant and identical to the membrane separation @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the local separation @xmath33 of two apposing , fluctuating membranes varies in space and time because of thermally excited membrane shape fluctuations .",
