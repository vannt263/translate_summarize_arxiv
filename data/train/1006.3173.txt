    "can be treated as a perturbation to oscillatory dynamics . in this case",
    "one can start with the phase description of noiseless oscillations , and consider noise as a perturbation",
    ". however , noise may be substantial in the sense that it induces oscillations in the system which would equilibrate otherwise .",
    "such noise - induced oscillations may be quite coherent disguising the underlying systems excitable nature .",
    "therefore , it may not be possible to distinguish between the two cases in an experimental setup unless noise may be eliminated .    despite of evident similarities between noise - perturbed and noise - induced oscillations , a phase description of noise - induced oscillations",
    "can not be obtained through standard perturbative procedures , because in the noise - free situation there is no dynamics .",
    "recently , this problem was addressed by an effective description , where noise - induced oscillations driven by an external periodic force could be characterized in a genuine way  @xcite .",
    "it was seen , that the effective phase model relies on an average concept of speed given by the current velocity  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize the method of  @xcite . for this , we show that an alternative effective phase model is possible , and compare the two approaches . after a summary of well - known dynamical properties of stochastic phase oscillators in the next section , we outline the current model of effective phase theory for a single oscillator ( section [ sec : currentmodel ] ) .",
    "hereon , an alternative model based on first passage times is presented in section [ sec : ptm ] modeling other aspects of stochastic dynamics . in section [ sec : asymptotics ] , mathematical aspects of the theory in its limiting cases for small and large noise are discussed highlighting differences and similarities of the effective phase models . a special emphasis is put on the description of noise - induced oscillations in these limits . in section [ sec : stochprc ] , phase resetting curves of stochastic phase oscillators and their relation to the first passage model of effective phase theory are described .",

    "could be modeled , too , by adding noise to ( [ eq : genefd ] ) in a certain way . drawing a more general framework , we will present in the next two sections the effective phase model from @xcite and another effective phase model based on first passage times in a coherent way .",
    "roughly , the difference of these models is in the definitions of the mean velocity . given an interval of length @xmath39 , velocity can be measured as the quotient of @xmath39 and the mean time @xmath40 , that @xmath24 spends in this interval .",
    "this leads exactly to an effective phase description as presented in  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , velocity can be measured as the quotient of @xmath39 and the mean time taken to reach the opposite boundary of the interval , leading to the concept of _ first passage velocity_. for deterministic phase oscillators the two definitions of velocity coincide , whereas for oscillations driven by a random force there is a difference , which is especially pronounced for oscillations that are noise - induced .",
    "we start by constructing the deterministic phase equation for the _ current model _ @xmath41 by using the notion of speed based on the mean time that the stochastic phase oscillator ( [ eq : generalosci ] ) spends in an interval @xmath42 $ ] . this time is defined according to the invariant probability density @xmath43 .",
