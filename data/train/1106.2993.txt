    "the study of algorithmic randomness has been an active area of research in recent years .",
    "the basic problem is to quantify the randomness of a single real number .",
    "here we think of a real @xmath6 $ ] as an infinite sequence of 0 s and 1 s , i.e.  as an element in @xmath7 .",
    "there are three basic approaches to algorithmic randomness : the measure - theoretic approach of martin - lf  tests , the incompressibility approach of kolmogorov complexity , and the betting approach in terms of martingales .",
    "all three approaches have been shown to yield the same notion of ( algorithmic ) randomness .",
    "the present paper will consider only the measure - theoretic approach .",
    "a real @xmath8 is martin - lf  random if for any effective sequence @xmath9 of c.  e. open sets with @xmath10 , @xmath11 . for background and history of algorithmic randomness",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the study of random sets and in particular of random closed sets is a vibrant area in probability and statistics , with many applications in science and engineering .",
    "the notion of capacity plays an important role here as a part of the analysis of imprecise or uncertain observations , for example in intelligent systems . for background on the theory of random sets",
    "see @xcite .    in a series of recent papers @xcite , g. barmpalias , p. brodhead , d. cenzer , s. dashti , j.b .",
    "remmel and r. weber have defined a notion of algorithmic randomness for closed sets and continuous functions on @xmath12 . here",
    "the polish space @xmath12 is equipped with usual product topology and has a basis of clopen sets .",

    "the study of randomness for closed sets and continuous functions has several interesting aspects concerning properties of those sets and properties of the members of such sets .",
    "the topological and measure - theoretic properties of effectively random closed sets has been studied .",
    "for example , it is shown in @xcite that every effectively random closed set is perfect and has lebesgue measure 0 .",
    "the complexity of effectively random closed sets as subsets of @xmath12 was considered in @xcite , where it was shown that no effectively closed ( @xmath14 ) set is random but there is a random @xmath15 closed set .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the set of zeroes of an effectively random continuous function is an effectively random closed set .    just as an effectively closed set in @xmath7",
    "may be viewed as the set of infinite paths through a computable tree @xmath17 , an algorithmically random closed set in @xmath7 may be viewed as the set of infinite paths through an algorithmically random tree @xmath1 .",
    "diamondstone and kjos - hanssen @xcite give an alternative definition of algorithmic randomness for closed sets according to the galton - watson distribution and show that this definition produces the same family of algorithmically random closed sets .",
    "we note that in probability theory a random closed subset of a topological space @xmath18 is considered a random variable which takes on the values in the space @xmath19 of closed subsets of @xmath18 .",
    "that is , let @xmath20 be a _ probability space _ with underlying topological space @xmath21 , @xmath22-algebra @xmath23 and measure @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 is defined for all sets @xmath27 .",
    "for example , we might have @xmath28 , @xmath29 the family of borel subsets of @xmath12 , and @xmath24 the standard lebesgue measure . the map @xmath18 induces a probability measure @xmath30 on @xmath19 given by @xmath31 .",
    "classically , the statement that a random closed set has no computable elements means that the collection of closed sets with no computable elements has measure one . in effective randomness",
    ", there is a particular collection @xmath32 of _ algorithmically random _ closed sets which has measure one . in this context , the statement that effectively random closed sets have no computable elements is to say that the closed sets in @xmath32 have no computable elements .",

    "we present a family of computable measures on @xmath13 which will lead to different notions of effective randomness for closed sets .    in section two ,",

    ". an effective version of choquet s capacity theorem is proved .",
    "the main theorem of section three gives conditions under which the capacity @xmath45 of a @xmath41-random closed set @xmath4 is either equal to @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",

    "this means that for any node @xmath22 in the tree @xmath55 , @xmath22 has unique extension @xmath56 in @xmath55 with probability @xmath57 , and similarly @xmath22 has unique extension @xmath58 with probability @xmath57 .",

    "it is important to note that , since the random closed sets have measure one in the space @xmath13 of closed sets , this result implies that almost all closed sets have capacity zero .",
    "this is a _ new _ result about the classical measure and capacity of closed sets in general and not only about algorithmic randomness or computability .    on the other hand , if @xmath61 , then every effectively @xmath53-random closed set @xmath4 has capacity @xmath62 , and hence almost every closed set has positive capacity . a more general result is given .    in section four ,",
