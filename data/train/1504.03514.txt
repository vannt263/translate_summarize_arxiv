    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is recognised as one of the most powerful cosmological probes .",
    "the study of temperature anisotropies by missions like _ wmap _ @xcite or _ planck _",
    "@xcite , and previous ground - based and balloon - born experiments , have reached levels of sensitivity and angular resolution that have allowed the determination of the main cosmological parameters with accuracies close to 1% .",
    "the cmb polarization anisotropies also encodes a wealth of cosmological information .",
    "not only the e - mode polarization have allowed to tighten the cosmological constraints by breaking degeneracies between parameters , but the detection of the b - mode polarization may provide a confirmation of the existence of primordial gravitational waves created by inflation , the epoch of exponential expansion in the primordial universe @xcite .",
    "specifically - targeted experiments like quiet @xcite or bicep @xcite have already started to put constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath1 , the parameter that is used to parameterise the amplitude of the b - mode signal .",
    "others like sptpol @xcite or polarbear @xcite have measured the small - angular scale b - mode component which is not primordial but originated by the lensing of the e - mode polarization by large - scale - structure .",
    "recently , the first primordial b - mode detection was claimed in data from the bicep2 experiment  at 150  ghz , with a level of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , data from the _ planck _ satellite have shown that the level of polarized dust emission in the region of the sky covered by bicep2 could form a significant component of the measured signal @xcite , thus causing a likely reduction in the level of cosmological signal that can be inferred from the bicep2 results .    it is well recognised that any unambiguous detection of the b - mode anisotropy requires a detailed assessment of the level of foreground contamination and ideally confirmation by independent experiments operating at different frequencies .",
    "the quijote ( q - u - i joint tenerife ) experiment @xcite , thanks to its wide frequency coverage ( 10 - 40  ghz ) , will provide the characterization of the polarization of the synchrotron and anomalous microwave emission ( ame ) , and of the b - mode signal down to a sensitivity of @xmath0 .",
    "updated information of the project can be found in http://www.iac.es/project/cmb/quijote .",
    "the quijote experiment is a scientific collaboration between the instituto de astrofsica de canarias , the instituto de fsica de cantabria , the idom company , and the universities of cantabria , manchester and cambridge .",
    "the project consists of two telescopes and three instruments covering the frequency range @xmath3  ghz , with an angular resolution of @xmath4 , and located at the teide observatory ( 2400  m ) in tenerife ( spain ) .",
    "this site provides excellent atmospheric conditions for cmb observations , as demonstrated by previous experiments ( tenerife experiment , iac - bartol , jbo - iac interferometer , cosmosomas , vsa ) .",
    "data obtained with the first quijote experiment throughout one year shows that the zenith atmosphere temperature is on average @xmath5k at 11  ghz and @xmath6k at 19  ghz , while the pwv column density is typically between 2 and 4  mm .    the first quijote telescope ( qt1 ) is currently fitted with the multi - frequency instrument ( mfi ) , which has four frequency bands centred in 11 , 13 , 17 and 19  ghz , respectively .",
    "it saw first light on november 2012 , and ever since is performing routine observations of different fields .",
    "some results obtained with this experiment will be presented in section  [ sec : science ] .",
    "the second quijote telescope ( qt2 ) was installed at the observatory on july 2014 .",
    "this telescope will be fitted with the thirty - gigahertz instrument ( tgi ) , consisting in 31 polarimeters at 30  ghz and which will start commissioning on april 2015 .",

    "is computed as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the total system temperature , @xmath9 is the bandwidth and @xmath10 the number of channels ( computed here as the number of horns times the number of output channels per horn ) .",
    "the neps are different for mfi compared to tgi and fgi because of their different strategies for measuring the polarization . in the mfi it involves differentiating pairs of channels , whereas the tgi and the fgi will make use of electronic modulation providing an instantaneous measurement of @xmath11 and @xmath12 for each channel .",
    "the mfi parameters measured using real observations are in good agreement with the nominal parameters shown in table  [ tab : characteristics ] .",
    "in particular , the measured @xmath11 and @xmath12 neps are in the range @xmath13k  @xmath14 for different frequency channels . in total intensity @xmath15 , where the instrument knee frequencies are worse ( @xmath16  hz for @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath17  hz for @xmath15 ) the instantaneous sensitivities are typically a factor @xmath18 worse .",

    "in this section we will present a succinct description of the technical details of the project .",
    "more extended details can be found in previous proceedings @xcite , and in more extended papers that are in preparation .",
    "both the qt1 and the qt2 are based on an offset crossed - dragone optic , with projected apertures of @xmath19  m and @xmath20  m for the primary ( parabolic ) and secondary ( hyperbolic ) mirrors , and provide highly symmetric beams ( measured ellipticity @xmath21 ) with very low sidelobes ( @xmath22  db ) and polarization leakage ( @xmath23  db ) .",
    "these mirrors are supported by an altazimuth mount , which allows rotation around the vertical azimuth axis at a maximum speed of 6  rpm ( @xmath24/s ) .",
    "the qt1 and qt2 mirrors have been manufactured with surface accuracies to make them operative up to 90  ghz and 200  ghz , respectively .",
    "this instrument is fed with four independent sky pixels : two of them operate at @xmath25  ghz and the other two at @xmath26  ghz . each pixel consists in a conical corrugated feedhorn feeding a novel cryogenic on - axis stepping polar modulator .",
    "continuous rotation of these polar modulators , which would allow instantaneous measurements of @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is not appropriate for long - term operation of the system , and instead we obtain @xmath11 and @xmath12 by differentiating pairs of channels , and step each modulator with a periodicity of @xmath27  one day in order to reduce systematics .",
    "the input orthogonal linear polar signals are separated by a wide - band cryogenic omt ( ortho - mode - transducer ) and later amplified through a pair of mmic ( monolithic microwave integrated circuit ) 6 - 20  ghz lnas ( low - noise - amplifiers ) .",
    "these signals are then fed into a room - temperature back - end module ( bem ) , where they are further amplified , and later split and passed through a @xmath28-hybrid , providing four outputs .",
    "each of these outputs is then split and the total band passes spectrally filtered into an upper and lower band , each with a bandwidth of 2  ghz .",
    "therefore , each pixel provides a total of eight channels , four in each of these two bands ( see table  [ tab : characteristics ] ) .",
    "the low - frequency pixels provide channels centred in 11 and 13  ghz , and the high - frequency pixels centred in 17 and 19  ghz . in practice ,",
    "only half of these channels are used to measure @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as the pair differences result in the removal of the @xmath29 noise .",
    "the other are affected by different @xmath29 noises as the two channels of each pair pass through different lnas , and are not used .",
    "we plan however to correct for this by the installation of two @xmath30-hybrids , after which the eight channels will be useful and as a consequence the mfi sensitivity of equation  [ eq : nep ] will be improved by a factor 2 .",
    "the tgi will be fitted with 31 polarimeters sensitive in the frequency range @xmath31  ghz .",
    "as it was said before , the original design of the mfi , based on spinning polar modulators , was found to be not suitable for long - term operations .",
    "thus , in the tgi we have modified the receiver configuration by replacing the polar modulators by a fixed polarizer . the modulation of the polarized signal is achieved by the combination of one @xmath30 and one @xmath28 phase switch .",
    "the two states of these switches are exchanged in order to generate four polarization states to minimise the different systematics of the receiver .",
    "the fgi will be fitted with 31 polarimeters working in the frequency range @xmath32  ghz .",
    "the conceptual design is the same as in the tgi .",
    "the quijote project is envisaged to achieve two primary scientific goals :    * to detect the b - mode signal from primordial gravitational waves down to a sensitivity @xmath33 ; * to determine the polarization properties of the synchrotron and anomalous microwave emissions from our galaxy at low frequencies ( @xmath3  ghz ) .    to meet these goals",
    "we will perform two polarization surveys :    * a wide galactic survey .",
    "it covers around @xmath34  deg@xmath35 and after 6 months of observations with each instrument it will have a final sensitivity of @xmath36k / beam at 11 , 13 , 17 and 19  ghz ( mfi ) , @xmath37k / beam at 30  ghz ( tgi ) and @xmath38k / beam at 40  ghz ( fgi ) .",
    "currently we are finalising this survey with the mfi , and have accumulated 5.5 months of data ; * a deep `` cosmological '' survey .",
    "it will encompass around @xmath39  deg@xmath35 .",
    "here we shall obtain a sensitivity of @xmath40k / beam after 2 years of observations with the mfi ( 11 - 19  ghz ) , and @xmath41k / beam with the tgi ( 30  ghz ) and with the fgi ( 40  ghz ) .    according to these nominal sensitivities",
    ", quijote will provide one of the most sensitive measurements of the polarization of the synchrotron and anomalous microwave emissions in the frequency rage 10 - 20  ghz .",
    "this is essential as the b - mode signal is known to be sub - dominant over the galactic synchrotron in our frequency range . using the mfi maps from the deep survey we will be able to determine the amplitude and spectral index of the synchrotron emission in every individual pixel , and therefore extrapolate to 30 and 40  ghz in order to correct the tgi and fgi maps .",
    "our goal is to have a residual synchrotron emission at these frequencies below the noise sensitivity of these maps . according to the forecasted sensitivities in the deep cosmological survey , we have shown in a previous publication@xcite that after 1  year of effective observing time over @xmath39  deg@xmath35 with the tgi we could reach a sensitivity on the tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath42 ( at the 95% c.l . ) .",
    "the combination of 3  years of effective time with the tgi and 2  years with the fgi ( we can observe simultaneously with the two instruments because we have two telescopes ) would allow to reach @xmath0 .",
    "so far , we have invested a significant amount of time to observe different fields related with non - core since programmes .",
    "some of these are : + i ) study of the polarization of the anomalous microwave emission ( ame ) .",
    "currently there is very limited observational information about the level of polarization of the ame , and only upper limits , typically at @xmath43 @xcite , have been published .",
