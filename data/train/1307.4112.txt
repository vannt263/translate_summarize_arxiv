    "although much is known about the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , almost all information on the bands and their carriers has been derived by studying the interstellar medium ( ism ) within a few kiloparsecs of the sun . these observations probe the behaviour of the carriers when subjected to the conditions present in the milky way ( mw ) ism .",
    "however , the carriers may behave differently when exposed to different conditions , which may provide useful information on the carriers .",
    "the ism in other galaxies can have quite different properties , for example the metallicity , ambient ultraviolet ( uv ) field , gas - to - dust ratio etc .",
    "observations of dibs in other environments can be used to test known correlations e.g. between dib equivalent width and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , uv field etc .",
    "if these correlations are found to vary , this will provide information on the carriers .",
    "if instead the correlations are found to be universal , then observations of dibs can be used as proxies for other interstellar conditions which may be much more difficult to determine in extragalactic objects .",
    "the study of dibs in extragalactic environments has expanded in recent years with observations of the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite , supernovae @xcite and m31 @xcite . a review of extragalactic dib detections and their utility is given by cordiner ( 2013 , this volume ) .",
    "m33 is an attractive target for studies of extragalactic dibs because :    * it is sufficiently close that individual stars can be resolved in seeing limited observations * m33 is a late - type spiral with many early - type stars , providing suitable targets * the low inclination of the disk means the stars are seen through a relatively simple interstellar column ( unlike e.g. m31 ) * low foreground milky way extinction @xmath4 * there is a radial velocity offset between material in m33 and the mw foreground , allowing the location of the dibs and atomic lines to be determined from their velocities * m33 has an angular size of @xmath5 , which is well matched to the fields of view of many multi - object spectrographs * a large body of multiwavelength data is available for comparison purposes    we therefore embarked upon a project to observe dibs in m33 .",
    "the first detections in this galaxy were reported towards a single star by @xcite ; here we present an expanded sample of forty - three stars .",
    "band image from @xcite ; targets are circled and numbered . stars 3 , 13 and 14 were eliminated due to unsuitable spectral types ( see section  [ sec : types ] ) , stars 5 , 6 , 7 and 11 were discarded due to blended photometry ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : blends ] ) , and align1 and align2 are foreground mw stars used to align the slitmask . ]",
    "a total of forty - three stars in m33 were observed using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph [ deimos , @xcite ] on the 10 m keck  ii telescope .",
    "the observations were performed on the night of 2003  november  1 as part of a stellar metallicity study .",
    "the targets were photometrically selected to be bright ( @xmath6 ) a- and b - type supergiants ; their distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : targets ] . using two different tilts of the 1200 g grating , the observations covered wavelengths of approximately 3,5009,000  ( with two small gaps ) .",
    "the resolution was constant at @xmath7 , which corresponds to resolving powers of @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "the continuum signal - to - noise ratio at 6,000  ranged from 30300 , with most stars in the range 60100 .",
    "full details of the observations and data reduction are given in @xcite and smith  ( in preparation ) .",
    "the spectral types of each target were determined by comparison to the standard stars of @xcite and @xcite , with luminosity classes assigned based on the h  @xmath10 equivalent width @xcite .",
    "we subsequently discarded 2 foreground mw k - type stars used for alignment , and 1 wolf - rayet and 3 luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) in m33 as unsuitable for the study of dibs [ the lbv spectra have been published in @xcite ] .",
    "this left 1 o - type , 27 b - type , and 9 later - type stars in m33 , mostly supergiants .",
    "band and the circles show the catalogued sources , both from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]   band and the circles show the catalogued sources , both from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]   band and the circles show the catalogued sources , both from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    total reddenings @xmath2  were determined from the photometry of @xcite and the intrinsic colours of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a further four targets were rejected as having blended photometry in @xcite , see figure  [ fig : blends ] .",
    "the foreground mw reddening in this direction of @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was subtracted to give the reddening in m33 , @xmath0 .       & @xmath12 dibs and the na  i  d  lines . both dibs are clearly detected , and separate m33 and foreground mw components can be seen in the na  i  doublet .",
    "the stellar he  i d@xmath13 line is also detected . ]",
    "we analysed the na  i  d lines to determine the velocities of the ism absorption in m33 and the mw foreground ( e.g. figure  [ fig : example ] ) , then searched for dibs at the m33 velocity .",
    "equivalent widths were measured using standard dib profiles , shifted and scaled to fit the observations using a @xmath14 minimisation routine .",
    "the standard profiles were derived from a high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectrum of @xmath15  sco @xcite , degraded to the deimos resolution .",
    "this could cause systematic errors if the dibs in m33 have different profile shapes to those towards @xmath15  sco , but we see no evidence for any differences .",
    "see @xcite for details of this procedure , which reduces systematic errors when measuring broad , asymmetric dibs in low signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "dibs were detected towards a total of 20 stars .     of the @xmath16 dib and the reddening in m33 @xmath0 .",
    "milky way comparison data , and the line showing the mean mw relation , are taken from @xcite .",
    "the m33 detections lie towards the upper end of the range seen in the mw . ]",
    "the relationship between the equivalent width @xmath17 of the @xmath16 dib and @xmath0  is shown in figure  [ fig:5780_reddening ] .",
    "most of the measurements in m33 lie towards the upper limit of the range seen in the mw , particularly at low reddenings .",
    "however , this might just be a selection effect , because equivalent widths of @xmath18m  would not be reliably detected at the signal - to - noise of our spectra . there could be contamination of the measurements by the @xmath19 dib , which is too weak and shallow to reliably detect in our spectra but frequently overlaps @xmath16 in observations of targets in the mw .",
    "the measurements also cover only a restricted range in @xmath0 .",
    "analysis of the @xmath20 dib and comparison with data at other wavelengths ( e.g. 8@xmath21 m pah emission ) is under way .",
    "one star , j013346.96 + 303642.8 , has especially strong dibs for its reddening and is the highest equivalent width detection in figure  [ fig:5780_reddening ] .",
    "a total of 7 dibs were detected towards this star , at velocities corresponding with the m33 na  i  absorption : @xmath22 , 5780 , 5797 , 6203 , 6269 , 6283 and 6613 , plus a tentative detection of @xmath23 .",
    "a full analysis of the spectrum of this star was presented in @xcite .",
    "we have presented the first sample of diffuse interstellar bands in the nearby galaxy m33 .",
    "forty - three stars were observed using the deimos spectrograph on keck .",
    "stellar spectral types were assigned for all stars , and m33 reddenings @xmath0  derived .",
    "dibs were detected towards 20 stars , demonstrating that their carriers are abundant in this galaxy .",
    "the relationship between the equivalent width of the @xmath16 dib and @xmath0  was found to be at the upper limit of the range seen in the milky way , although this may be a selection effect whereby weak dibs are not detected in our spectra .",
    "one star , j013346.96 + 303642.8 , has especially strong dibs for its reddening and seven different dibs were detected towards this star .",
