    "as is well known , confluent hypergeometric functions appear in a vast number of applications in physics and engineering . in spite of their importance , few algorithms are available for the computation of any of the standard solutions of the kummer equation in the case of real or complex parameters ; see for example @xcite for the computation of @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we describe a method for computing the kummer function @xmath0 for small values of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 by using a simple expansion of a function in terms of reciprocal gamma functions . to compute the kummer function @xmath0 for small values of @xmath5 , the connection formulas for this function in terms of the @xmath3-functions",
    "is the most obvious starting point .",

    "this phenomenon occurs as well for positive integer values of @xmath2 , but when the case for @xmath10 is under control , we can use stable recursions @xcite to handle @xmath11 .",
    "it should also be noted that , for numerical evaluations with fixed precision , the power series expansions can only be used for rather small positive values of @xmath1 , say , for @xmath12 .",
    "this is due to the behaviour of the @xmath3-functions , which become exponentially large as @xmath13 , whereas the @xmath14-function is only of algebraic growth in that case .    with the coefficients provided by the expansion in terms of reciprocal gamma functions",
    ", we can safely compute the function @xmath0 and its @xmath1-derivative in double precision for @xmath15 this computational method complements others described in @xcite , where the computation of the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath0 is considered in other ( complementary ) parameter domains .",
    "in the paper we also consider an asymptotic approximation of the kummer function @xmath0 in terms of modified @xmath16-bessel functions and discuss its numerical performance for small @xmath5 .",
    "an analysis of the stability of the recurrence relations satisfied by the coefficients of the expansion is provided as well as few tests illustrating its behaviour .",
