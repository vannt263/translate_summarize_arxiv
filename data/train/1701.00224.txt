    "after the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc @xcite , precision study of its properties becomes one of the most important tasks in theory and experiment .",
    "so far , the measured higgs gauge couplings are compatible with the sm predictions at 1 - 2@xmath5 level",
    ". however , the higgs fermion couplings remain obscure . among them , the higgs - top coupling is of particular interest @xcite .    in the sm , the top quark has the strongest coupling with the higgs boson .",
    "as such , the higgs - top coupling plays an special role in the hierarchy problem @xcite and the vacuum stability of the sm @xcite .",
    "many models for physics beyond the sm related with these two problems predict a modified higgs - top coupling .",
    "so , the precise measurements of higgs - top coupling could give an insight on the pattern of fermion mass generation and the energy scale of new physics above the electroweak scale .",
    "the most general lagrangian of the @xmath6 interaction can be parameterised as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the top quark mass and @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . in the sm , @xmath10 and @xmath11 at leading order @xcite . at the lhc",
    ", the higgs - top coupling can be probed through the gluon fusion production ( @xmath12 ) @xcite and the associated production of the top pair with higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "the former has a sizable cross section .",
    "however , it is not only altered by a modified higgs - top coupling but also by new possible colored particles , e.g. scalar tops or composite top partners .",
    "the latter is directly determined by the higgs - top coupling , and thus is golden mode for this measurement @xcite .",
    "the high order qcd and ew corrections to the @xmath6 production have recently been studied @xcite . with the data set of the 7 and 8 tev runs of the lhc , the signal strengths in the @xmath6 production channel have been measured by both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite in various higgs decay modes : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . given",
    "the large boosted cross section of @xmath6 @xcite , the lhc run-2 would be able to pin down @xmath6 production very soon .    in order to enhance the observability of @xmath6 production ,",
    "the dedicated reconstruction approaches of the top quark and higgs boson have been proposed @xcite . on the other hand , it is obvious that the measurement of the signal strength of @xmath6 production alone is not sufficient to unveil the nature of the higgs - top coupling in eq .",
    "[ tth ] . therefore , it is essential to investigate the kinematical distributions of @xmath6 production at the lhc . in previous studies ,",
    "the spin polarization / correlation effects of top quarks were used to probe the higgs - top interactions in @xmath6 production at the lhc .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the spin observables usually depends on the specific reference frames , the reconstruction efficiency of the top quark momenta and the kinematical cuts @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose to use the difference of rapidity of two leptons ( @xmath1 ) from the top decays to diagnose the cp property of higgs - top couplings through the dileptonic channel of @xmath0 production at the lhc .",
    "such an observable is boosted invariant and can be distorted by the cp violating @xmath6 interaction because of the appearance of top quark charge asymmetric term .",
    "at the lhc , the dominant production of @xmath6 is through the gluon fusion ( c.f . fig .  [",
    "fig : tthbb_feynman ] ) .",
    "the presence of the cp violating higgs - top interaction in eq .",
    "[ tth ] will lead to the top quark charge asymmetry term in @xmath6 production . to see this",
    ", we take the @xmath16-channel gluon fusion subprocess as example . assuming incoming gluons momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 , outgoing top and antitop momenta @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and higgs momentum @xmath21 , the amplitude is given by @xmath22\\gamma_{\\rho}v(\\bar{t})}{(2q_1\\cdot q_2)(m^2_h+2p_t\\cdot p_h)}j^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu}\\epsilon^{\\mu}_{1}\\epsilon^{\\nu}_{2},\\nonumber\\\\   & & -\\frac{\\bar{u}(t)\\gamma_{\\rho}[(\\slashed p_{\\bar{t}}+\\slashed p_h)-m_t]\\gamma_{t\\bar{t}h}v(\\bar{t})}{(2q_1\\cdot q_2)(m^2_h+2p_{\\bar{t}}\\cdot p_h)}j^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu}\\epsilon^{\\mu}_{1}\\epsilon^{\\nu}_{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the triple gluon interaction and @xmath24 .",
    "its contribution to the cross section of @xmath6 production involves the factor @xmath25 , which is asymmetric in the interchange of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and will affect the kinematics of the decay products of the top / anti - top quark .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] , we show the parton level correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath28 in dileptonic @xmath0 production for @xmath3 at 14 tev lhc .",
    "we can see that @xmath1 indeed has a strong correlation with @xmath28 , which indicates that the dynamical reason for changing @xmath29 distribution comes from the above top quark charge asymmetric term rather than spin - correlation . for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the distributions of @xmath29 spreads towards the large values , as a comparison with @xmath32 .     and",

    "we can see that the the sm interaction ( @xmath32 ) has more events than the mixed ( @xmath30 ) interaction in the range of @xmath37 , followed by pseudo - scalar interaction ( @xmath38 ) . while the distribution is reverse in the range of @xmath39 .",
    "such a behavior will give a small ( large ) asymmetry @xmath2 for @xmath38 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "besides , it can seen that the difference among @xmath34 in @xmath1 distribution is not sensitive to the increase of @xmath40 .",
    "this indicates that the variable @xmath1 has a good discriminating power for the different cp phases even in boosted phase space .    to quantitatively describe the difference in @xmath29 distributions for different cp phase",
    ", we define a central - edge asymmetry , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the critical value of @xmath1 that is determined from the crossing point of @xmath1 distributions for the different cp phase .",
    "the prediction of @xmath2 significantly different from the sm value of @xmath6 production would strongly indicate the the non - standard cp violating higgs - top interaction in eq .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tab : asym ] , we present the values of @xmath45 at the reconstructed level after all above cuts . it can be seen that the values of @xmath45 are mildly diminished by the event selections , but are still obviously different for @xmath3 .    a straightforward gaussian estimate of the significance of @xmath2 is given by @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : significance ] , we show the significance of @xmath2 versus the luminosity @xmath47 at 14 tev lhc .",
    "we find that the sm prediction of @xmath2 can be observed at @xmath48 level when @xmath49 fb@xmath50 , while for the mixed and pseudo - scalar interactions , their significance is less than @xmath48 in the run of 14 tev lhc .    finally , we estimate the cp discrimination in higgs - top couplings by calculating the binned-@xmath4 of the @xmath1 histogram at reconstructed level . in fig .

    "we also find that such an observable has a good discrimination power of the cp violating couplings in boosted regime .",
    "to numerically show the difference in @xmath1 distributions , we define a central - edge asymmetry @xmath2 , which can reach -40.3% , -26.6% and -9.5% for cp phase @xmath3 , respectively . besides , we simply perform the binned-@xmath4 analysis of @xmath1 distribution and find that the scalar interaction and the pseudo - interaction can be distinguished at 95% level at 14 tev lhc with @xmath52 fb@xmath50 of integrated luminosity .",
