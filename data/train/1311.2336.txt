    "an example of such a test is given by the sprt - bank , according to which each sensor runs an sprt locally , transmits its decision to the fusion center and the latter stops and selects @xmath17 the first time that any sensor makes a selection in favor of the alternative , whereas it stops and selects @xmath16 when all sensors have made a decision in favor of the null ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . another asymptotically optimal sequential test in this setup can be obtained if @xmath51 in ( [ sprt ] ) is replaced by the generalized log - likelihood ratio statistic , @xmath73 , or more generally by any statistic of the form @xmath74 where each @xmath75 is a positive constant @xcite , @xcite .",

    "however , this test may not be implementable in practice , even for a moderate number of sensors .",
    "consider , for example , the completely _ unstructured _ case , where there is absolutely no prior information regarding the set of affected sensors and @xmath15 is given by @xmath79 then , the implementation of the above sequential tests demands summing / maximizing @xmath80 statistics at every time @xmath54 , a requirement that may be prohibitive in practice .",
    "in the present paper , we focus on the case that @xmath15 is given by ( [ powerset ] ) , i.e. , we assume that signal may be present in _ any _ subset of sensors under the alternative hypothesis . in this context",
    ", we propose a class of sequential tests , whose implementation at any time @xmath54 requires @xmath0 ( instead of @xmath80 ) operations , and we establish their asymptotically optimality .",
    "specifically , we set @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are one - sided stopping times of the form @xmath84 and each @xmath85 is an @xmath86-adapted statistic that should be chosen appropriately .",
    "our main contribution in this work is that we show how to select these statistics , as well as the thresholds @xmath87 and @xmath88 , in order to guarantee the asymptotic optimality of the proposed sequential test .",
    "thus , in section [ sec2 ] we show that @xmath89 is asymptotically optimal under both hypotheses , when for every @xmath1 and @xmath9 @xmath90 there is a constant @xmath91 so that @xmath92 and thresholds @xmath87 and @xmath88 are selected so that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the inverse of the survival function of the erlang distribution with parameters @xmath95 and @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath96    conditions ( [ condi])-([condi2 ] ) are clearly satisfied when each @xmath97 is chosen as the positive part of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , in which case @xmath100 . in section [ sec3 ] , we show that if each sensor @xmath2 communicates with the fusion center only when @xmath101 increases by @xmath102 since the previous communication time , then selecting @xmath85 as the value of @xmath101 at the most recent communication time also satisfies conditions ( [ condi])-([condi2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that the asymptotic optimality of @xmath89 remains valid in this context , even with an asymptotically low rate of communication .",
    "this infrequent communication is a very important property in applications characterized by limited bandwidth , where it is necessary to design schemes that require minimal transmission activity from the sensors to the fusion center ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such communication constraints have motivated the problem of _ decentralized _ sequential hypothesis testing ( see , e.g. , @xcite- @xcite ) , where each sensor is required to transmit a small number of bits whenever it communicates with the fusion center . however , in this literature , it is typically assumed that the set of affected sensors is known in advance ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) and asymptotically optimal decentralized sequential tests have been proposed only under this assumption ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our second main contribution in the present work is that we construct a decentralized sequential test which requires _",

    "let us add a few remarks to this statement :    1 .",
    "conditions ( [ condi])-([condi2 ] ) are clearly satisfied when @xmath156 . an alternative specification that satisfies these conditions",
    "is presented in the next section .",
    "2 .   condition ( [ condi2 ] ) is _ not _ needed for @xmath143 to belong in @xmath37 and to be asymptotically optimal under @xmath16 .",
    "3 .   the asymptotic optimality of @xmath143 remains valid even if @xmath157 for one or more @xmath2 , as long as @xmath158 . in the next section",
    "we will show that , with a particular specification for @xmath85 , this property has an interesting interpretation in terms of the communication requirements of the proposed scheme .",
    "let us first note that the one - sided sequential test @xmath83 is an one - shot scheme ; it requires that each sensor communicate with the fusion center at most once , as soon as its local log - likelihood statistic takes a value smaller than @xmath159 , at which time it simply needs to transmit a one - bit message to the fusion center , informing it about this development .    on the other hand , the implementation of the stopping rule @xmath82 can be much more demanding from a communication point of view . for example , if we set @xmath156 , sensor @xmath2 needs to transmit the actual value of @xmath101 at every time @xmath54 ( or at least whenever it is positive ) . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "this may not be possible in applications characterized by bandwidth constraints .    in what follows",
    ", we assume that thresholds @xmath87 and @xmath88 are selected according to ( [ ab ] ) and our goal is to suggest specifications for @xmath160 that induce low transmission activity , while preserving the asymptotic optimality of the sequential test @xmath143 .    in order to achieve this",
    ", we require that each sensor @xmath2 communicate with the fusion center only at an increasing sequence of @xmath161-stopping times , @xmath162 , which are finite under @xmath122 . in other words ,",
    "each sensor should communicate with the fusion center only at some particular time instances and , at any given time , the decision to communicate or not should depend exclusively on the observations that have been acquired locally at the sensor until this time .",
    "given such a sequence of communication times , we denote by @xmath163 the instance of the most recent transmission and by @xmath164 the number of transmitted messages up to time @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath165 at any given time @xmath54 , the value of @xmath101 at the most recent communication instance , @xmath166 can not be larger than @xmath167 , the maximum value of @xmath101 up to time @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , note that @xmath168 coincides with @xmath101 at the communication times @xmath162 and stays flat in between .",
    "therefore , selecting @xmath169 according to ( [ second ] ) satisfies condition ( [ condi ] ) and , consequently , it guarantees that @xmath143 belongs in @xmath37 and is asymptotically optimal under @xmath16 .",
    "when , in particular , the communication times are described by the recursion @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 is a positive constant , then it is straightforward to see that , for any time @xmath54 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , in the case of the communication scheme ( [ tau ] ) , setting @xmath97 equal to @xmath168 satisfies condition ( [ condi2 ] ) as well and implies that @xmath143 is asymptotically optimal also under @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , the final remark in the end of section [ sec2 ] suggests that the latter asymptotic optimality property is preserved even with an asymptotically low rate of communication from one or more sensors , as the constant @xmath172 in this setup controls the average period of communication at sensor @xmath2 .    from the right - hand side in ( [ second ] ) it is clear that selecting @xmath97 as @xmath168 requires that at each time @xmath175 sensor @xmath2 transmit to the fusion center ( with an `` infinite - bit '' message ) the exact value of @xmath176 , the `` realized '' local log - likelihood ratio between @xmath177 and @xmath175 .",
    "however , if one insists that a small number of bits be transmitted at each communication , which is the main requirement in decentralized sequential testing @xcite , then this selection is no longer acceptable .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of the communication scheme ( [ tau ] ) , it is intuitively clear that the value of each @xmath176 should be close to @xmath172 , at least when @xmath101 does not have `` heavy tails '' and/or @xmath172 is `` large '' .",
    "this suggests selecting each @xmath97 according @xmath178 a selection that requires transmission of a _",
    "single bit _ from each sensor at each communication time .",
    "moreover , for every time @xmath54 it is clear that @xmath179 therefore , selecting @xmath97 according to ( [ third ] ) satisfies condition ( [ condi ] ) and , consequently , it guarantees that @xmath143 belongs in @xmath37 and is asymptotically optimal under @xmath16 . on the other hand , for every @xmath54 we have @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the random , non - negative overshoot associated with the @xmath182 transmission from sensor @xmath2 .",
    "this means that selecting each @xmath85 according to ( [ third ] ) does not satisfy condition ( [ condi2 ] ) , therefore theorem [ theo2](ii ) can no longer be applied to establish the asymptotic optimality of @xmath143 under @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , in the following theorem we show that this property remains valid if two additional conditions are satisfied .",
    "the first is that , for every @xmath183 , each @xmath184 must have a finite second moment under @xmath122 , i.e. , @xmath185= \\int \\log \\bigl ( \\frac{f_1^{k}(x)}{f_0^{k}(x ) } \\bigr)^{2 } \\ , f_{1}^{k}(x ) \\ , \\nu^{k}(dx ) < \\infty,\\ ] ] a condition that guarantees that @xmath186\\ ] ] is a finite quantity for any given @xmath187 and an @xmath188 term as @xmath157 for every @xmath183 .",
    "the second is that , now , we _ must _ let @xmath157 so that @xmath158 for every @xmath1 , so that each sensor does not communicate with the fusion center very frequently and the ( unobserved ) overshoots do not accumulate very fast .    in what follows ,",

    "moreover , the above results can be generalized in the case that a lower bound , @xmath220 , and an upper bound , @xmath221 , are available on the number of affected sensors , that is when @xmath222 . furthermore , it is straightforward to generalize the decentralized sequential test described in section [ sec3 ] , so that more than one bits are transmitted per communication .",
    "these additional bits can be utilized for the quantization of the unobserved overshoots and can improve the performance of the proposed test in the case of high rates of communication .",
    "finally , we should note that all these extensions , which will be presented elsewhere , require the assumption of independence across sensors . removing this assumption",
    "remains an open problem .",
