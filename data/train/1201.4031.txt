    "@xcite our main conclusions are drawn from the simple , but important , two localized - state junction in which hopping is _ nearest - neighbor_.@xcite later , we briefly discuss larger 1d systems , which exhibit rather surprising features of the thermoelectric transport . we show that such systems may have a high figure of merit , as @xmath6 can become extremely small , while the thermopower , @xmath5 , remains finite .",
