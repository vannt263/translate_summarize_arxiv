    "cosmological minihaloes at high redshift  i.e. dark - matter dominated haloes with virial temperatures @xmath6 , with masses above the jeans mass in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) before reionization ( @xmath7 )  are believed to have been the sites of the first star formation in the universe . to form a star , the gas inside these haloes must first",
    "have cooled radiatively and compressed , so that the baryonic component could become self - gravitating and gravitational collapse could ensue . for the neutral gas of h and he at @xmath8 inside minihaloes , this requires that a sufficient trace abundance of @xmath3 molecules formed to cool the gas by atomic collisional excitation of the rotational - vibrational lines of @xmath3 .",
    "the formation of this trace abundance of @xmath3 proceeds via the creation of intermediaries , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , which act as catalysts , which in turn requires the presence of a trace ionized fraction , in the following two - step gas - phase reactions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , henceforth , `` sgb94 '' ; ): @xmath11 and @xmath12 unless there is a strong destruction mechanism for @xmath9 ( e.g. cosmic microwave background at @xmath13 ) , the former ( equation [ eq : solomon ] ) is generally the dominant process for @xmath3 formation .",
    "gas - dynamical simulations of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe suggest that the first stars formed in this way when the dense gas at the centres of minihaloes of mass @xmath14 cooled and collapsed gravitationally at redshifts @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . this work and others further suggest that these stars were massive ( @xmath16 ) , hot ( @xmath17 ) , and short - lived ( @xmath18 ) , thus copious emitters of ionizing and dissociating radiation .    these stars constitute the population iii ( pop iii ) stars , or zero metallicity stars , which are believed to have exerted a strong , radiative feedback on their environment .",
    "the details of this feedback and even the overall sign ( i.e. negative or positive ) are poorly understood .",
    "once the ionizing radiation escaped from its halo of origin , it created h ii regions in the igm , beginning the process of cosmic reionization .",
    "the photoheating which accompanies this photoionization raises the gas pressure in the igm , thereby preventing baryons from collapsing gravitationally out of the igm into new minihaloes when they form inside the h ii regions , an effect known as `` jeans - mass filtering '' ( sgb94 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . inside the h ii regions ,",
    "whenever the i - fronts encounter pre - existing minihaloes , those minihaloes are subject to photoevaporation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth , sir ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth , isr ) ) .",
    "a strong background of uv photons in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands of @xmath3 also builds up which can dissociate molecular hydrogen inside minihaloes even in the neutral regions of the igm , thereby disabling further collapse and , thence , star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". this conclusion changes , however , if some additional sources of partial ionization existed to stimulate @xmath3 formation without heating the gas to the usually high temperature of fully photoionized gas ( @xmath19 ) at which collisional dissociation occurs , such as x - rays from miniquasars @xcite or if stellar sources create a partially - ionized boundary layer outside of intergalactic h ii regions @xcite .",
    "such positive feedback effects , however , may have been only temporary , because photoheating would soon become effective as background flux builds up over time @xcite .    the study of feedback effects has been limited mainly by technical difficulties .",
    "@xcite studied the feedback of lw , ultraviolet ( uv ) , and x - ray backgrounds on minihaloes without allowing hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "@xcite studied the radiative feedback effect of stellar sources only on a static , uniform igm .",
    "@xcite studied stellar feedback more self - consistently by performing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer , but the resolution of these simulations is not adequate for resolving minihaloes .",
    "@xcite also performed cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , with higher resolution , but radiative feedback was treated assuming the optically thin limit , which overestimates the ionization efficiency , especially in the high density regions which would initially be easily protected from ionizing radiation due to their high optical depth .",
    "the first self - consistent , radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of the feedback effect of external starlight on cosmological minihaloes were those of sir and isr , who studied the encounter between the intergalactic i - fronts that reionized the universe and individual minihaloes along their path .",
    "these simulations used eulerian , grid - based hydrodynamics with radiative transfer and adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) to `` zoom - in '' with very high resolution , to demonstrate that the i - fronts from external ionizing sources are trapped when they encounter minihaloes , slowing down and transforming from weak , r - type to d - type , preceded by a shock .",
    "the gas on the ionized side of these i - fronts was found to be evaporated in a supersonic wind , and , if the radiative source continued to shine for a long enough time , the i - front eventually penetrated the minihaloes entirely and expelled all of the gas .",
    "these simulations elucidated the impact of the i - front and the physical effects of ionizing radiation on minihalo gas , quantifying the timescales and photon consumption required to complete the photoevaporation .",
    "they did not , however , address the aftermath of `` interrupted '' evaporation , when the source turns off before evaporation is finished .",
    "recent studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite addressed this question for minihaloes exposed to the radiation from the first pop iii star in their neighbourhood , instead of the effect of either a steadily - driven i - front during global reionization or a uniform global background .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are seriously misleading , however , since they did not account properly for the optical depth to hydrogen ionizing photons .",
    "@xcite assumed that the uv radiation from the first pop iii star that formed inside a minihalo in some region would fully ionize the gas in the neighbouring minihaloes . using 3d hydrodynamics simulations",
    ", they found that , when the star turned off , @xmath3 molecules formed in the dense gas that remained at the centre of the neighbouring minihalo , fast enough to cool the gas radiatively and cause gravitational collapse leading to more star formation .",
    "the @xmath3 formation mechanism was the same as that described by @xcite , in which ionized gas of primordial composition at a temperature @xmath20 cools radiatively and recombines out of ionization equilibrium , enabling an enhanced residual ionized fraction to drive reaction ( 1 ) ( and [ 2 ] , as well ) as the temperature falls below the level at which collisional dissociation suppresses molecule formation . as a result ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the radiative feedback of the first pop iii stars was positive , triggering a second generation of star formation in the minihaloes surrounding the one that hosted the first star .",
    "@xcite also used 3d hydrodynamics simulations to consider the fate of the gas in the relic h ii regions created by the first pop iii stars .",
    "they concluded that the radiative feedback of the first stars could be either negative or positive and estimated a critical uv intensity which would mark the transition from negative to positive feedback .",
    "@xcite , however , studied this effect only in the optically thin limit , as had also been done by @xcite",
    ". the main mechanisms of the positive feedback effect in @xcite and @xcite are , therefore , identical .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , performed a high - resolution ray - tracing calculation to track the position of the i - front created by the first pop iii star as it swept outward in the density field of a 3d cosmological sph simulation of primordial star formation in the @xmath0cdm universe over the lifetime of the star .",
    "when this i - front encountered the minihaloes in the neighbourhood of the one which hosted the first pop iii star , it was trapped by the minihalo gas before it could reach the high - density region ( core ) , due to the minihalo s high column density of neutral hydrogen .",
    "this is consistent with the results of sir and isr mentioned above . according to @xcite , in fact ,",
    "the lifetime of the pop iii star is less than the evaporation times determined by sir and isr for the relevant minihalo masses and flux levels in this case , so the neutral gas in the core is never ionized by the i - front .",
    "it seems that the initial assumption of full ionization of nearby haloes by @xcite and the optically thin limit assumed by @xcite are invalid .",
    "the final fate of this protected neutral core , however , is still unclear , because the i - front tracking calculations by @xcite did not include the hydrodynamical response of the minihalo gas to its ionization , a full treatment of radiative transfer or the primordial chemistry involving @xmath3 .",
    "one might naively expect that the nett effect would be negative , because heating from photoionization would ultimately expel most of gas from minihaloes , although the results of sir and isr , again , show that this minihalo evaporation would not be complete within the lifetime of the pop iii star . on the other hand , partial ionization beyond the i",
    "- front by hard photons from a pop iii star might be able to _ promote _ @xmath21 formation , once the dissociating uv radiation from the star is turned off , which would then lead to a cooling and collapsing core .",
    "this issue can be addressed only by a fully coupled calculation of radiative transfer , chemistry , and hydrodynamics , which will be the focus of this paper .",
    "we shall attempt to answer the following questions : does the light from the first pop iii star in some neighbourhood promote or prevent the formation of more pop iii stars in the surrounding minihaloes ? more specifically ,",
    "do the neutral cores of these nearby minihaloes , which are shielded from the ionizing radiation from the external pop iii star , subsequently cool and collapse gravitationally , as they must in order to form stars , or are they prevented from doing so ? towards this end , we simulate the evolution of these target haloes under the influence of an external pop iii star using the 1-d spherical , lagrangian , radiation - hydrodynamics code we have developed . we adopt a @xmath22 pop iii star as a source , and place different mass haloes at different distances to explore a wide range of the parameter space for this problem .",
    "masses of target haloes are chosen to span the range from those too low for haloes to cool and collapse by @xmath21 cooling without external radiation to those massive enough to do so on their own .",
    "our calculation is the first self - consistent gas - dynamical calculation of the feedback effects of a single pop iii star on nearby haloes .",
    "a similar approach by 1-d radiation - hydrodynamics calculation has been performed by @xcite .",
    "their work , however , focuses on the effect of a steady global background from quasars and from stars with surface temperatures @xmath23 , rather than a single , short - lived pop iii star with @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , while we were preparing this manuscript , a study which is similar to our work was reported by @xcite , where a 3d radiation - hydrodynamics calculation with sph particles was performed ] .",
    "a major difference of their work from ours is that they focus on the subclumps of the halo which hosts the first pop iii star , while we focus on external minihaloes in the neighbourhood of such a host halo .",
    "we also apply a more accurate treatment of @xmath21 self - shielding , as well as a more complete chemistry network of neutral and ionic species of h , he , and @xmath21 .",
    "a more fundamental difference from these previous studies is our finding of a novel @xmath25 formation mechanism : _ collisional ionization of pre - i - front gas by a shock detached from a d - type i - front_. this mechanism occurs at the centre of target haloes , which would otherwise remain very neutral .",
    "this mechanism creates new electrons abundant enough to promote further @xmath21 formation , which can even expedite the core collapse .    in section [ sec : code ]",
    "we describe the details of the 1-d spherical radiation - hydrodynamics code we have developed .",
    "some details left out in section [ sec : code ] will be described in appendices . in section [ sec : initial - setup ] , we describe the initial setup of our problem .",
    "we briefly describe a test case in section [ sec : opt - thin ] , where we let a minihalo evolve from an initially ionized state , to show that our code reproduces the result of @xcite in that case . in section [ sec : mcm ] and section [ sec:2star - result ] , we present the main results of our full radiation - hydrodynamics calculation .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec:2star - discussion ] . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the @xmath0cdm cosmological parameters , ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) = ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , consistent with the _ wmap _ first - year data @xcite and the index of the primordial power spectrum @xmath34 would translate to @xmath35 redshift delay of structure formation and reionization @xcite ] .",
    "in this section , we describe in detail the 1-d spherical , lagrangian , radiation - hydrodynamics code we have developed for both dark and baryonic matter .",
    "we describe how hydrodynamics , dark matter dynamics , radiative transfer , radiative heating and cooling , and finally the nonequilibrium chemistry are handled . the finite differencing scheme , reaction rates , and certain other details",
    "not treated in this section will be described in appendices .",
    "we include the neutral and ionic species of h , he and @xmath36 , namely h , @xmath37 , he , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath9 , @xmath3 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in order to treat the primordial chemistry fully .",
    "as deuterium and lithium exist in a negligible amount , we neglect @xmath42 and @xmath43 species already achieved by @xmath44 cooling alone , down to the temperature of the cmb .",
    "as the hd cooling process is negligible if gas remains neutral ( e.g. @xcite ) , however , we may neglect the hd cooling process in our calculation as long as we are interested in the centre of target haloes which remains mostly neutral at any time .",
    "we will discuss this issue further in section [ sec:2star - discussion ] . ] .",
    "the baryonic gas obeys inviscid fluid conservation equations , @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the internal energy per unit baryon mass , @xmath49 is the external heating rate , and @xmath0 is the radiative cooling rate .",
    "note that all the variables in equations ( [ eq : realhydro_mass ] ) - ( [ eq : realhydro_energy ] ) denote baryonic properties , except for @xmath50 , the mass enclosed by a radius @xmath51 , which is composed of both dark and baryonic matter .",
    "we do not change the adiabatic index @xmath52 throughout the simulation . as long as monatomic species , h and he ,",
    "dominate the abundance , @xmath53 is the right value to use .",
    "this ratio of specific heats , @xmath52 , can change significantly , however , if a large fraction of h is converted into molecules . for example , the three - body @xmath21 formation process , @xmath54 will occur vigorously when @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which will invalidate the use of a constant @xmath52 . to circumvent such a problem ,",
    "when such high density occurs , we simply stop the simulation .",
    "this process is , nevertheless , important in forming the protostellar molecular cloud ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this issue will be further discussed in section [ sec:2star - result ] , when we define the criterion for the collapse of cooling regions .",
    "the shock is treated using the usual artificial viscosity technique ( e.g. @xcite ) . the pressure @xmath57 in equations ( [ eq : realhydro_momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : realhydro_energy ] ) contains the artificial viscosity term .",
    "the details of this implementation are described in appendix a.      gravity is contributed both by the dark matter and the baryonic components .",
    "let us first focus on the dark matter component .",
    "in order to treat the dark matter gravity under spherical symmetry , almost all previous studies have used either a frozen dark matter potential or a set of self - gravitating dark matter shells in radial motion only ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "both methods have their own limitations .",
    "the frozen potential approximation can not address the effect of a possible evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "the radial - only dark matter approximation suffers from the lack of any tangential motion , producing a virialized structure whose central density profile is much steeper ( @xmath58 with @xmath59 ; see e.g. ) than that of haloes in cosmological , 3-d n - body simulations ( @xmath60 , as found in @xcite ) .    in order to treat the dynamics of dark matter more accurately than these previous treatments",
    ", we use the the fluid approximation we have developed and reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize its derivation here ; for a detailed description , see @xcite .",
    "collisionless cdm particles are described by the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "when integrated , it yields an infinite set of conservation equations , which is called the bbgky hierarchy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , cdm n - body simulations show that virialized haloes are well approximated by spherical symmetry .",
    "these simulations also show that the velocity dispersions are highly isotropic : radial dispersion is almost the same as the tangential dispersion .",
    "these two conditions make it possible to truncate the hierarchy of equations to a good approximation , which then yields only three sets of conservation equations .",
    "amazingly enough , these equations are identical to the normal fluid conservation equations for the adiabatic index @xmath53 gas : @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 where the subscript @xmath64 represents dark matter , the effective pressure @xmath65 is the product of the dark matter density and the velocity dispersion at a given radius , and the effective internal energy per dark matter mass @xmath66 .",
    "we use these effective fluid conservation equations ( equation [ eq : dm_mass ] , [ eq : dm_momentum ] , [ eq : dm_energy ] ) to handle the motion of dark matter particles .",
    "note that dark matter shells in this code represent a collection of dark matter particles in spherical bins , in order to describe `` coarse - grained '' properties such as density ( @xmath67 ) and the effective pressure ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "as these coarse - grained variables follow the usual fluid conservation equations , the hyperbolicity of these equations leads to the formation of an effective `` shock . ''",
    "the location of this shock will determine the effective `` post - shock '' region .",
    "this post - shock region corresponds to the dark matter shell - crossing region .",
    "because of the presence of this effective shock , we also use the artificial viscosity technique .",
    "this collisional behaviour of our coarse - grained dark matter shells originates from our choice of physical variable . for further details ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for description and application of our fluid approximation .",
    "the mass enclosed by a dark matter shell of radius @xmath51 , @xmath69 enters equations ( [ eq : realhydro_momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : dm_momentum ] ) . when computing @xmath70 , we properly take account of the mismatch of the location of dark matter shells and baryon shells .      a full , multi - frequency ,",
    "radiative transfer calculation is performed in the code .",
    "since @xmath21 cooling is of prime importance here , we first pay special attention to calculating the optical depth to uv dissociating photons in the lw bands and the corresponding @xmath21 self - shielding function .",
    "we then describe how we calculate the optical depth associated with any other species depending upon the location of the radiation source .",
    "the finite difference scheme for the calculation of radiative rates is described in the appendix a.      hydrogen molecules are photodissociated when a uv photon in the lw bands between @xmath71 and @xmath72 excites @xmath3 to an excited electronic state from which dissociation sometimes occurs . when the column density of @xmath21 becomes high enough ( @xmath73 ) , the optical depth to photons in these lyman - werner bands can be high , so @xmath21 can `` self - shield '' from dissociating photons .",
    "exact calculation of this self - shielding requires a full treatment of all 76 lyman - werner lines , even when only the lowest energy level transitions are included .",
    "such a calculation is feasible under simplified conditions such as a radiative transfer problem through a static medium ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , for combined calculations of radiative transfer and hydrodynamics , such a full treatment is computationally very expensive .    under certain circumstances , however",
    ", one can use a pre - computed self - shielding function expressed in terms of the molecular column density @xmath74 and the temperature @xmath75 of gas , which saves a great amount of computation time . in a _ cold , static _ medium , for instance ,",
    "one can use a self - shielding function provided by @xcite : @xmath76 .",
    "\\label{eq : db_shield_factor_cold}\\ ] ] the photodissociation rate is then given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is the mean intensity in the spectral region of the lw bands .",
    "this approximation has been widely used in the study of high redshift structure formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with equation ( [ eq : db_shield_factor_cold ] ) is that when the gas temperature is high or gas has motion along the line of sight to the source , the thermal and velocity broadening of the lw bands caused by the doppler effect can significantly reduce the optical depth . a better treatment for thermal broadening is also given by @xcite , now in terms of the molecular column density @xmath80 and the velocity - spread parameter @xmath81 of the gas : @xmath82 , \\label{eq : db_shield_factor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the atomic weight @xcite . for @xmath21 , @xmath87 .",
    "in the problem treated in this paper , we frequently find @xmath88 in the gas parcel ( shell ) which contributes most of the @xmath21 column density .",
    "we also find that this gas parcel usually moves at @xmath89 ( see section [ sub : h2shell ] ) .",
    "the combined effect of the thermal broadening and the doppler shift on the shielding function , then , may be well approximated by a thermally broadened shielding function with @xmath90 . throughout this paper , therefore , we use equation ( [ eq : db_shield_factor ] ) with @xmath91 to calculate the self - shielding . for the photo - dissociation rate ,",
    "we use equation ( [ eq : db_rate ] ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig - db ] how much the static , cold shielding function ( equation [ eq : db_shield_factor_cold ] ) may overestimate the self - shielding in our problem , by comparing this to the thermally - broadened shielding function ( equation [ eq : db_shield_factor ] ) at @xmath91 .",
    "the biggest discrepancy between these two shielding functions exists for @xmath92 .",
    "interestingly enough , the @xmath21 column density in our problem usually resides in this regime .",
    "it is crucial , therefore , to take into account the effects of thermal broadening and doppler shift carefully , as we do in this paper .",
    "since our calculations are 1-d , spherically - symmetric , we have assumed the external radiation source contributes a radial flux @xmath93 at frequency @xmath94 and radius @xmath51 , measured from the minihalo centre , given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the source luminosity , and @xmath97 is the optical depth along the radial direction from radius @xmath51 to the source located at a distance @xmath98 .",
    "the radiative rate of species @xmath99 at radius @xmath51 is then given by @xmath100 where we have used the fact that @xmath101 , as long as the external radiation can be approximated as a 1d planar flux . in practice ,",
    "one calculates this rate in a given grid - cell  i.e. spherical shell  with finite thickness .",
    "if such a grid - cell has a small optical depth , @xmath102 is almost constant across the grid , so one could take the grid - centred value of @xmath103 to calculate @xmath104 .",
    "this naive scheme , however , does not yield an accurate result when a grid - cell is optically thick , where @xmath102 may vary significantly over the cell width .",
    "this problem occurs frequently for solving radiative transfer through optically thick media , where individual cells have large optical depth . in order to resolve this problem",
    ", we use a `` photon - conserving '' scheme like that described by @xcite and @xcite . the details of our implementation of this scheme are described in the appendix a.        photoheating results from thermalization of the residual kinetic energy of electrons after they are photoionized . in general , the photoheating function is described by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the threshold energy over which the residual photon energy is converted into the kinetic energy of electrons , and the nett heating function @xmath49 is the sum of individual heating functions ( \\{@xmath107 } ) . in finite - differencing equation ( [ eq : generic_photo_heat ] ) , we also use the photon - conserving scheme as we do for equation ( [ eq : rad_rate_ext_body ] ) .",
    "this prevents cells with large optical depth from obtaining unphysically high heating rates .",
    "see appendix a for details .",
    "cooling occurs through various processes .",
    "for atomic species , it comes from collisional excitation , collisional ionization , recombination , free - free emission , and cmb photons scattering off free electrons ( compton cooling / heating ) . for atomic h and he , cooling is dominated by collisional excitation ( for @xmath108 ) and free - free emission ( for @xmath109 ) .",
    "the atomic cooling rate decreases rapidly at @xmath110 , as there are no collisions energetic enough to cause excitation .",
    "it is difficult , therefore , to cool gas below @xmath111 solely by atomic cooling of primordial gas .    molecular hydrogen ( @xmath36 ) , however , is able to cool gas below @xmath111 , down to @xmath112 , by collisional excitation of rotational - vibrational lines by h atoms .",
    "an important question to address is how much @xmath36 is created , maintained , or destroyed under the influence of an ionizing and dissociating radiation field .",
    "even a small fraction , @xmath113 , is sometimes enough to cool gas below @xmath114 ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",

    "the processes included and adopted are shown in table [ table : rates ] in appendix b. most of the rate coefficients are those from the fits by @xcite , with a few updates .",
    "we also adopt the rate solving scheme proposed by @xcite .",

    "the time for this evolution of the target halo gas is short compared to the age of the universe when the first star forms in their neighbourhood . as a result",
    ", it is likely that the target haloes are exposed to the ionizing and dissociating radiation from that first star as they are in the midst of evolving , with fine - tuning required to catch all of them in a particular stage of this evolution . as the evolutionary `` phase '' of our target haloes",

    "i , chemical abundances have not yet evolved away from their igm equilibrium values .",
    "this stage is characterized by low @xmath3 fraction , @xmath162 and high electron fraction , @xmath163 .",
    "phase ii is the state which is reached , after allowing the phase i minihalo to evolve chemically , thermodynamically and hydrodynamically for a few million years ( a small fraction of a hubble time , @xmath164 at @xmath135 ) , until the electron fraction has decreased to @xmath165 .",
    "phase ii is characterized by high @xmath3 fraction , @xmath166 , and cooling - induced compression of the core relative to phase i , by a factor between 1 and 20 , higher for higher minihalo mass .",

    "the second initial condition we choose is the evolved state ( phase ii ) reached by allowing the system to evolve from phase i initial conditions before the arrival of radiation from the pop iii star . in particular , we follow this evolution until the central electron fraction has dropped to @xmath183 by recombination from phase i. we choose this condition because it is now characterized by high molecule and low electron fraction , contrary to phase i. the fate of this halo will then mainly be determined by how easily this abundant @xmath21 is protected against dissociating radiation after the star turns on .",
    "the answer will also depend upon how much change has occurred hydrodynamically , because in some cases the halo core may have cooled and collapsed significantly enough to be unaffected by the feedback from _ late _ irradiation .",
    "the time to reach phase ii is different for different mass haloes because of different gas properties .",
    "initially , as we start from the tis density profile whose central density is independent of the halo mass , the recombination rate is higher for smaller mass haloes , because hydrogen recombines according to the following : @xmath184 the situation becomes complicated , however , once evolution begins and density changes .",
    "the @xmath21 cooling and collapse in the central region of the haloes is increasingly effective as halo mass increases , because of the increasingly large difference between the virial temperature and the @xmath21 cooling temperature plateau , @xmath185 .",
    "the corresponding rapid collapse and cooling in massive haloes can easily offset the initial temperature dependence by obtaining high density and low temperature , as is seen in equation ( [ eq : k2_dep ] ) .",
    "phase ii for large mass haloes represents haloes that have already started their cooling and collapse .    in fig .",

    "before describing the results of our full radiative transfer , hydrodynamics calculation , we describe an experiment designed to show the effect of neglecting the optical depth of the minihalo to ionizing radiation from the external star during the star s lifetime on the minihalo s evolution after the star shuts off . for this purpose",
    ", we assume the target minihalo is initially fully - ionized and heated to the temperature of a photoionized gas as it would be if it were instantaneously flash - ionized by starlight in the optically - thin limit .",
    "such a setup is equivalent to that used by @xcite , where they find that second - generation star formation is triggered when the ionization of the minihalo caused by the nearby pop iii star leads to cooling by @xmath192 .",
    "the high initial electron fraction is present because of the assumption of full ionization allows quick formation of @xmath192 , which then cools the central region before it reaches the escape velocity .    for this experiment , we initialized ionized fractions as following : @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 for other species . without disturbing the halo density profile",
    " we use the tis halo model , which is described in section [ sub : phase1 ]  , we also assigned a high initial temperature appropriate for photoionized gas , @xmath200 .",
    "these abundance and temperature values roughly mimic the condition found in typical h ii regions .",
    "we find that such an initial condition leads to the collapse of the core region , when the formation of @xmath36 stimulated by the high initial electron fraction enables @xmath3 cooling .",
    "gas in the outskirts evaporates from the halo , however , because pressure forces accelerate the gas to escape velocity before it can form @xmath36 and cool .",
    "the @xmath36 cooling and adiabatic cooling which happen later in this outflowing gas do not reverse the evaporation ( fig .",
    "[ fig - zap ] ) .    our results for this case agree with the outcome of @xcite .",
    "this led those authors to suggest that the first stars exerted a positive feedback effect on their surroundings , triggering a second generation of star formation .",
    "a question arises , however , as to whether this fully - ionized initial condition of nearby minihaloes is actually achieved by the first pop iii star to form in their neighbourhood . as already mentioned in section  [ sec : secondstar - intro ] , @xcite found that the i - front from this pop iii star gets trapped in those minihaloes and can not reach the central region before the star dies . in this paper",
    ", we will confirm that the fully - ionized initial condition of @xcite is never achieved when one considers the coupled radiative and hydrodynamic processes more fully .",
    "we will also show that , if any protostellar region is to form in the target halo , it does so in the neutral core region which the ionizing photons do not penetrate .",
    "when a minihalo forms as a nonlinear , virialized , gravitationally - bound structure out of the linearly perturbed igm , a change of chemical abundance occurs due to the change of gas properties .",
    "most importantly , the hydrogen molecule fraction changes from the igm equilibrium value , @xmath201 , to a new equilibrium value , @xmath202 .",
    "even with such a small fraction , @xmath21 can cool gas to @xmath203 , where @xmath204 represents the temperature `` plateau '' that gas in primordial composition can reach by @xmath3 cooling .",
    "there exists a minimum collapse mass of minihaloes , @xmath205 , above which haloes , in the absence of external radiation , can form cooling and collapsing cores within the hubble time at a given redshift .",
    "the gap between the @xmath3 cooling plateau temperature , @xmath206 , and the minihalo virial temperature , @xmath207 , given by equation ( [ eq : tvir ] ) is a useful indicator of the success or failure of collapse .",
    "for instance , at @xmath208 , @xmath209 for @xmath210 . as @xmath211 ,",
    "even after gas cools to @xmath204 , it can not collapse fast enough to serve as a site for star formation . on the other hand , @xmath212 for @xmath213 , and the temperature s",
    "cooling down to @xmath214 will make the gas gravitationally unstable , which will lead to runaway collapse .",
    "this argument is supported by the results of @xcite , for example , that collapse can occur only in haloes with @xmath215 .",
    "we model the initial minihalo structure by the tis model as described in section [ sub : phase1 ] and let it evolve in the absence of radiation , starting from the igm chemical abundance and minihalo virial temperature ( phase i ) .",
    "we determine @xmath205 by the criterion @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the time at which the central density reaches @xmath218 ( the density suitable for initiating three - body @xmath3 formation ; see e.g. @xcite ) , and @xmath219 is the hubble time at a given redshift .",
    "we find that @xmath220 at @xmath135 ( see fig . [ fig - freeevol ] ) .",
    "we have plotted the evolution of minihalo centres in the absence of radiation , where each run starts from phase i. this is in rough agreement with @xmath221 , the value found by @xcite . the discrepancy is larger with results by @xcite and @xcite , where they obtain @xmath222 . the biggest contrast exists with @xcite , where they find @xmath223 at @xmath224 , almost 30 times as large as our findings .",
    "we argue that this discrepancy in minimum collapse mass results primarily from how well the minihalo structure is resolved . unless the centre , which gains the highest molecule formation rate due to the highest density , is fully resolved , one could be misled by a poor numerical resolution such that certain low - mass haloes , which can cool and collapse in reality , are in hydrostatic equilibrium in the simulation . the resolution becomes poorer in the following sequence : @xcite , which gives the best agreement with our result , used an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) scheme , resolving baryonic mass down to @xmath225 .",
    "such high resolution is suitable to resolve even the central part of the smallest minihaloes whose total baryonic mass content is roughly @xmath226 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , on the other hand , used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) scheme , using sph particles of mass @xmath227 .",
    "finally , @xcite used a uniform top - hat model , where there is no radial variation in gas properties such as density and temperature , thus the central region is , in effect , completely unresolved .",
    "in addition , some of the rates used in @xcite were not accurate @xcite .",
    "we believe that @xmath220 at @xmath135 is close to reality , because our 1-d spherical setup is based upon the tis model which is a highly concentrated structure , and the resolution of our code is superior to previous calculations @xcite . ] .",
    "it is not our objective , however , to settle the exact value of @xmath205 .",
    "this estimate is based upon our specific criterion described in this section , and is subject to change under different criteria",
    ". this may also change if one adopts a more realistic halo formation history to account , for instance , for dynamical heating by accretion ( see @xcite ) . as the haloes we choose",
    "are rather conservatively divided into successful collapse ( for @xmath228 ) and failure ( for @xmath229 ) , agreeing with amr simulation result by @xcite , we shall proceed with our choice of parameter space and _ see how this fate of minihaloes changes as a result of external radiation from a pop iii star . _",
    "as described in section [ sec : initial - setup ] , we expose target haloes of different mass to the radiation from a pop iii star whose spectrum is approximated as a @xmath230 blackbody radiation field and whose flux is attenuated by the geometrical factor @xmath231 for different values of @xmath232 . in this section , we summarize the simulation results for both the phase i ( early irradiation ) and the phase ii ( late irradiation ) initial conditions .      in all cases , even in the presence of evaporation , we find no evidence of penetration of ionizing radiation into the halo core .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite for the h ii regions of the first pop iii stars and of @xcite and @xcite for the encounters between intergalactic i - fronts and minihaloes during reionization .",
    "there are two main reasons for this behaviour .",
    "first , the total intervening hydrogen column density is initially high enough to trap the i - front outside the core .",
    "second , the lifetime of the source is short compared to the evaporation time .",
    "if the source lived longer than the evaporation time , the i - front would eventually have reached the centre of the halo . in that case , @xcite find that the minihalo gas is completely evaporated . in our problem",
    ", however , the slow evaporation does not allow the i - front to reach the centre within the lifetime of a pop iii star .",
    "the i - front entering the minihaloes propagates as a weak r - type front in the beginning .",
    "the i - front then makes the transition to the d - type , after reaching the r - critical state .",
    "this r - critical state is reached when the i - front velocity @xmath233 satisfies the following condition : @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath236 , and subscripts 1 and 2 represent pre - front and post - front , respectively .",
    "when the i - front propagates into a cold region ( @xmath237 ) , as in our problem , this condition is approximately @xmath238 in all cases , we find that this transition occurs in times less than the lifetime of the source star , 2.5 myrs . after reaching the r - critical state , gas in front of the i - front forms a shock , which then detaches from the slowed i - front . as an example",
    ", we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - rcrit ] the profiles of phase i , @xmath239 halo at @xmath240 under different fluxes .",
    "all of the post - front ( ionized ) gas , initially undisturbed , eventually evaporates away , accelerated outward by a large pressure gradient . as the line - of - sight",
    "is cleared by this evaporation , ionizing radiation penetrates deeper , until the source turns off .",
    "see figs [ fig - rcrit ] , [ fig - midpoint ] and [ fig - endpoint ] for the evolution of the i - front .",
    "this result invalidates the initial condition adopted by @xcite and @xcite which led them to find that @xmath3 formed in the core region after it was ionized and then cooled while recombining , once the source turned off . as we show , the core remains neutral before and after the source is turned off , so the mechanism explored by @xcite does not work .",
    "this neutral core , therefore , must find a different way to cool and collapse if star formation is to happen in the target minihalo .",
    "what happens to the initially ionized gas after the star turns off ?",
    "this gas recombines as it cools radiatively and by adiabatic expansion , even forming @xmath3 molecules .",
    "we find that this cooling can not reverse the evaporation , however .",
