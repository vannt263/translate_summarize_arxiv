    "since the pioneering papers by watts and strogatz on small - world networks  @xcite and barabsi and albert on scale - free networks  @xcite , complex networks have received considerable attention as an interdisciplinary subject  @xcite .",
    "complex networks describe many systems in nature and society , such as internet  @xcite , world wide web  @xcite , metabolic networks  @xcite , protein networks in the cell  @xcite , co - author networks  @xcite and sexual networks  @xcite , most of which share three apparent features : power - law degree distribution , small average path length ( apl ) and high clustering coefficient . in recent years , many evolving models",
    "@xcite have been proposed to describe real - life networks .",
    "the original ba model  @xcite captures the two main mechanisms responsible for the power - law degree distribution of degrees , namely growth and preferential attachment .",
    "dorogovtsev , mendes , and samukhin  @xcite gave an exact solution for a class of growing network models thanks to the use of a `` master - equation '' .",
    "krapivsky , redner , and leyvraz @xcite examined the effect of a nonlinear preferential attachment on network dynamics and topology .",
    "amaral et al .",
    "@xcite studied models that incorporate aging and cost and capacity constraints in order to explain the deviations from the power - law behavior in several real - life networks .",
    "dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite also addressed the evolution of networks with aging of sites .",
    "bianconi and barabsi @xcite offered a model addressing the competitive aspect in many real networks such as world wide web .",
    "additionally , in real systems a series of microscopic events shape the network evolution , including the addition or rewiring of new edges or the removal of vertices or edges .",
    "albert and barabsi @xcite discussed a model that incorporates new edges between existing vertices and the rewiring of edges .",
    "dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite considered a class of undirected models in which new edges are added between old vertices and existing edges can be removed .",
    "although it is now established that preferential attachment can explain the power - law characteristic of networks , there is a wide range of microscopic alternative mechanisms that could affect the evolution of growing networks and still lead to the observed scale - free topologies .",
    "kleinberg et al .",
    "@xcite and kumar et al .",
    "@xcite proposed copying mechanisms motivated by the desire to explain the power - law degree distribution of the world wide web .",
    "chung et al .",
    "@xcite introduced also a duplication model for biological networks .",
    "krapivsky and render @xcite presented edge redirection mechanisms which are mathematically equivalent to the model of kumar et al @xcite . inspired by citation networks vzquez proposed in  @xcite the walking mechanism . actually scale - free networks can be created by various methods .",
    "comellas , fertin and raspaud @xcite introduced a category of graphs via a recursive construction .",
    "specific recursive and general scale - free constructions are given also in  @xcite and scale - free trees ( without clustering ) in  @xcite .",
    "zhou et al . construct in  @xcite an integer network using a pure mathematical method .    in relation to the problem of apollonian packing , a two - dimensional example of which",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1 , andrade et al . introduced apollonian networks  @xcite which were also proposed by doye and massen in  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that high - dimensional apollonian networks were already introduced in @xcite , but in this work the emphasis is placed on two - dimensional apollonian networks and to provide a model to help understanding the energy landscape networks .",
    "zhang et al . in @xcite",
    "offer a simple general algorithm producing high - dimensional apollonian networks and derive in detail analytical expressions for their order , size , degree distribution , clustering coefficient and diameter .",
    "inspired also by the apollonian packing , zhou et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple rule that generates random two - dimensional apollonian networks with very large clustering coefficient and very small apl .",
    "in this paper , motivated by high - dimensional apollonian packings , we present a simple iterative algorithm for high - dimensional random apollonian networks ( hdran ) which extends the idea introduced in @xcite for dimension two to any dimension .",
    "the algorithm can concretize the problems of abstract high - dimensional random apollonian packings . using the algorithm",
    "we determine relevant characteristics of hdran : scale - free degree distribution and large clustering coefficient which depend on the dimension of the apollonian packing .",
    "based on the algorithm , we estimate also that the average path length of the networks increases logarithmically with the number of vertices .",
    "therefore , these networks ( hdran ) have a small - world scale - free topology .",
    "the name of apollonian packings goes back to apollonius of perga ( c. 262 bc c. 190 bc ) who studied the problem of finding tangent circles to any three given circles .",
    "when the initial three circles are mutually tangent , there exist only two of such tangent circles , known as apollonian circles or soddy inner and outer circles .",
    "frederick soddy  @xcite , nobel prize for chemistry in 1921 , published in nature a poem describing the equation which relates the radii of the circles and is now known as the `` kissing circles theorem '' .",
    "this result , however , had been previously given by ren descartes in 1643 and rediscovered in 1842 by the mathematician phillip beecroftan .",
    "a generalization to @xmath0-dimensional hyperspheres , also as a poem , was published as well in nature by thorold gosset  @xcite and reads :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ and let us not confine our cares + to simple circles , planes and spheres , + but rise to hyper flats and bends + where kissing multiple appears , + in @xmath0-ic space the kissing pairs + are hyperspheres , and truth declares - + as @xmath1 such osculate + each with an @xmath2 fold mate + the square of the sum of all the bends + is @xmath0 times the sum of their squares . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in the procedure known as _ apollonian packing _ or _",
    "apollonian gasket _ , we start with three mutually tangent circles , and draw their inner soddy circles .",
    "then we draw the inner soddy circles of this circle with each pair of the original three , and the process is iterated , see fig.1 .",
    "this apollonian packing can be used to design a network , where each circle is associated to a vertex of the network and vertices are connected if the corresponding circles are tangent .",
    "we call this network a two - dimensional apollonian network  @xcite .    in a similar way , it is possible to construct higher dimensional ( @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4 ) apollonian networks associated with other self - similar packings .",
    "we start with @xmath5 mutually tangent @xmath3-dimensional hyperspheres ( @xmath3-hyperspheres ) in a @xmath3-dimensional simplex which is enclosed and tangent to a larger hypersphere , the interstices of which are curvilinear @xmath3-dimensional simplices ( @xmath3-simplices ) . in the first iteration , and inside each of the interstices , we add @xmath3-hyperspheres tangent to each of the @xmath5 @xmath3-hyperspheres bounding the curvilinear @xmath3-simplex .",
    "the added hyperspheres will not fill the interstice and each produces @xmath5 smaller interstices .",
    "then , in the second iteration , @xmath5 @xmath3-hyperspheres are added inside all of the @xmath5 new interstices , being again tangent to the enclosing @xmath3-hyperspheres . the process is repeated iteratively obtaining the high - dimensional apollonian packing .",
    "if each @xmath3-hypersphere corresponds to a vertex and vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding @xmath3-hyperspheres are tangent , then we obtain a @xmath3-dimensional apollonian network .    in the above @xmath3-dimensional apollonian packings , if we add only one @xmath3-hypersphere inside a randomly selected interstice in every iteration , after a certain number of iterations we have a high - dimensional random apollonian packing .",
    "analogously , if each @xmath3-hypersphere corresponds to a vertex and vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding @xmath3-hyperspheres are tangent , then one obtains @xmath3-dimensional random apollonian networks . in @xcite",
    "it is discussed the special case @xmath6 . here",
    "we will consider the general case .",
    "it should be noted that we consider the initial bounding @xmath3-hypersphere at the same level as the other @xmath5 initial @xmath3-hyperspheres .",
    "in the iterative process for the construction of hdran , at each step and for each new hypersphere added , @xmath5 new interstices are created in the packing , that will be filled in one of the following iterations .",
    "equivalently , for each new vertex added , @xmath5 new @xmath3-simplices are created in the network , into which vertices will be inserted in one of the following iterations . according to this process",
    ", we introduce a general iterative algorithm for hdran .",
    "we denote the @xmath3-dimensional random apollonian network after @xmath7 iterations by @xmath8 , @xmath4 . before introducing the algorithm",
    "we give the following definition . a complete graph @xmath9 ( also referred in the literature as @xmath3-clique ; see @xcite ) is a graph without loops whose @xmath3 vertices are pairwise adjacent .",
    "then the @xmath3-dimensional random apollonian network @xmath8 is constructed as follows .",
    "initially ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the complete graph @xmath12 or @xmath13-clique . at each step , we choose an existing subgraph isomorphic to a @xmath14-clique _ that has never been selected before _ , then we add a new vertex and join it to all the vertices of the selected subgraph .",
    "the growing process is repeated until the network reaches the desired size .",
    "note that when @xmath6 , our model gives the maximal planar network of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the network size is incremented by one with each step , in this paper , we use the step value @xmath7 to represent a vertex created at this step .",
    "we can see easily that at step @xmath7 , the network consists of @xmath15 vertices .",
    "the total degree equals @xmath16 .",
    "so , when @xmath7 is large the average vertex degree at step @xmath7 is equal approximately to a constant value @xmath17 , which shows that the network @xmath8 is sparse like many real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "in this section we show that the dimension @xmath3 is a tunable parameter which controls the relevant characteristics of a high dimensional random apollonian network @xmath8 .",
    "the degree distribution is one of the most important statistical characteristics of a network .",
    "we use the mean - field method  @xcite to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices , and calculate analytically the connectivity distribution @xmath18 and the scaling exponents . note that , after a new vertex is added , the number of @xmath14-cliques that can be chosen in the following step increases by @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we can immediately see that after @xmath7 steps , the number of @xmath14-cliques ready for selection are @xmath19 . given a vertex , when its degree increases by one , the number of @xmath14-cliques that contain the vertex increases by @xmath20 , so the number of @xmath14-cliques for selection containing the vertex @xmath21 with degree @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "if we consider @xmath24 continuous , we can write for a vertex @xmath21 @xmath25 the solution of this equation , with the initial condition that vertex @xmath21 was added to the network at @xmath26 with connectivity @xmath27 , is @xmath28 the probability that a vertex has a connectivity @xmath29 smaller than @xmath24 , @xmath30 , is @xmath31 assuming that we add the vertices to the network at equal intervals , the probability density of @xmath26 is @xmath32 substituting this into eq .",
    "( 3 ) we obtain that @xmath33    thus the degree distribution is @xmath34    for large @xmath7 @xmath35 and if @xmath36 then @xmath37 giving a degree exponent @xmath38 .",
    "this value is different from the degree exponent for a high dimensional apollonian network ( non random hdan ) which is @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy would need further study , but a possible explanation is that for two networks with the same number of vertices , hdran and hdan , the distribution of degrees differs because of the different growing process .",
    "the method used to obtain @xmath18 might have also some influence in the value of @xmath40 as it is explained at the end of the next subsection .",
    "when @xmath6 , one has @xmath41",
    "@xcite , while as @xmath3 goes to infinity @xmath42 .",
    "thus by tuning the parameter @xmath3 , it is possible to obtain a variety of scale - free networks with different exponents in the range , @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "2 , the degree distributions @xmath18 at various values of the dimension @xmath3 are displayed and we find that at any value of @xmath3 , the simulated degree distribution is in good agreement with the analytic value .     at various values of the dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the squares ( a ) , stars ( b ) , circles ( c ) , and triangles ( d ) denote the simulation results for @xmath6 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the reference dotted lines come from the evaluation of @xmath47 as given by equation ( 7).,width=453 ]    also , from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 7 ) , we can notice that when @xmath7 becomes large , the maximal degree of a vertex is roughly @xmath48 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a vertex is the ratio of the total number of existing connections between all its @xmath24 nearest neighbors and @xmath49 , the number of all possible connections between them .",
    "the clustering of the graph is obtained averaging over all its vertices .",
    "we can derive analytical expressions for the clustering @xmath50 for any vertex with degree @xmath24 .",
    "when a vertex is created it is connected to all the vertices of a @xmath14-clique whose vertices are completely interconnected .",
    "it follows that a vertex with degree @xmath51 has a clustering coefficient of one because all the @xmath52 possible links between its neighbors actually exist . in the following steps , a newly - created vertex links the considered vertex whose @xmath3 nearest neighbors",
    "are also connected by the new one at the same iteration step .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the degree of a vertex and its clustering . for a vertex @xmath53 of degree @xmath24 ,",
    "the exact expression for its clustering coefficient is @xmath54 which depends on the degree @xmath24 and the dimension @xmath3 .",
    "this expression indicates that the local clustering scales as @xmath55 for large @xmath24 .",
    "note that , as the clustering only depends on @xmath24 for a given dimension , it matches the results found in  @xcite for hdan .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a similar scaling has been observed in several real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath56 of hdran can be obtained as the mean value of @xmath50 with respect to the degree distribution @xmath18 expressed by eq .",
    "the result is @xmath57    for @xmath6 , equation ( 9 ) gives @xmath58 , which is the same result obtained in  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath44 we obtain @xmath59 . for @xmath45",
    "the analytical value is @xmath60 and for @xmath46 it is @xmath61 .",
    "we note that they do not depend on the order of the network .",
    "note also that for @xmath6 the value obtained is not far from the value of the clustering in the coauthorship network in neuroscience ( @xmath62 )  @xcite .",
    "thus the clustering @xmath56 of hdran is high and increases with the dimension @xmath3 and approaches a limit of @xmath63 when @xmath3 is large . in fig .",
    "3 , we present simulation results for @xmath56 vs the dimension @xmath3 for various values of the @xmath64 , the network order . for @xmath65 , the simulation results provide values of @xmath56 of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . we see that the small difference between analytical and simulation values decreases with @xmath3 . this difference might be explained because the continuum approach does not properly account all the vertices , affecting @xmath18 which is used in eq .",
    "( 9 ) to obtain @xmath56 , see  @xcite .     of hdran at various values of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the squares , stars , circles and triangles denote @xmath6 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines are fits to the simulated data.,width=302 ]      the average path length of a network ( apl ) is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path between two vertices averaged over all pairs of vertices .",
    "below , using the same approach than in  @xcite we will discuss the apl of a high dimensional random apollonian network .",
    "first we note that it is not very difficult to prove that for a hdran and for any two arbitrary vertices @xmath21 and @xmath70 each shortest path from @xmath21 to @xmath70 does not pass through any vertex @xmath24 satisfying that @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath72 denotes the distance between @xmath21 and @xmath70 , we introduce the total distance of a hdran with order @xmath64 as @xmath73 @xmath74 and we denote the apl by @xmath75 , defined as : @xmath76 according to the former remark , the addition of new vertices will not affect the distance between those already existing and we have : @xmath77 assume that the vertex @xmath78 is added joining the @xmath14-clique @xmath79 composed of vertices @xmath80 then eq . ( 12 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 . constricting the clique @xmath79 continuously into a single vertex @xmath83 ( here we assume that @xmath84 )",
    ", we have @xmath85 . since @xmath86 , eq .",
    "( 13 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a vertex set with cardinality @xmath89 .",
    "the sum @xmath90 can be considered as the total distance from one vertex @xmath83 to all the other vertices in our model with order @xmath91 and it can be roughly approximated in terms of @xmath92 : @xmath93 note that , as @xmath75 increases monotonously with @xmath64 , it is clear that : @xmath94 from equations ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , we can obtain the expression : @xmath95 considering eq .",
    "( 17 ) as an equation and not an inequality , we can provide an upper bound for the variation of @xmath73 as @xmath96 which gives @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant . as @xmath99",
    ", we have @xmath100 . note that as we have deduced equation ( 19 ) from an inequality , then @xmath75 increases at most as @xmath101 with @xmath64 .    in fig .",
    "4 , we report the simulation results on the average path length @xmath102 vs the dimension @xmath3 for various values of the network order @xmath64 , which agree well with the analytic results .",
    "note that the apl decreases with the dimension @xmath3 as the networks become more dense .",
    "the dependence of the apl on @xmath3 , comes from the method used to obtain eq .",
    "( 14 ) as the sum there is on a set @xmath103 with cardinality @xmath89 .     of a hdran vs its network size @xmath64 for different values of the dimension @xmath3 .",

    "the lines are fits to the simulated data .",
    "one can see that @xmath102 grows at most as @xmath101.,width=302 ]",
    "in summary , we have introduced an iterative algorithm for the construction of high - dimensional random apollonian networks associated with high dimensional random packings .",
    "the networks have the typical characteristics of many technological and social networks and are small - world with power - law degree distributions , thus they can model a variety of scale - free networks of the real - life world .",
