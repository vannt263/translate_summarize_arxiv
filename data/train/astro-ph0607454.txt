    "error bars on  are estimated in two ways ; the solid error bars are derived from jacknife resampling the quasar sample while the dotted error bars show the standard deviation across twelve independent mock catalogs . to derive the error in the mock catalogs , we use 45 randomly - selected galaxies in each catalog ( chosen before the slitmask target selection is applied ) to act as proxies for quasars .",
    "we then calculate the cross - correlation function with the rest of the galaxy sample , in the same manner as is calculated for the deep2 data .",

    "@xcite measure a redshift - space @xmath147 , not a real - space @xmath148 , which is not easy to compare with our results as @xmath147 is not a power - law and the results therefore depend on the range of scales fit .",

    "overall we find a quasar clustering amplitude and bias that are @xmath155 lower than previous results .",
    "our measurements have comparable error bars to these other studies , which have significantly larger quasar samples .",
    "this shows the power of using cross - correlations with galaxy samples instead of auto - correlations of quasar samples alone .",
    "our results can also be compared to theoretical models of how quasars that are fueled by galaxy mergers should cluster at @xmath156 .",
    "@xcite model the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function using a semi - analytic model in which quasars are fueled by major galaxy mergers @xcite . in this model",
    ", the peak quasar luminosity depends on the mass of gas accreted by the black hole , and the quasar luminosity declines exponentially after the merger event .",
    "this leads to a natural prediction that brighter quasars reside in more massive galaxies , so that the quasar clustering amplitude should be luminosity - dependent in a manner which is sensitive to quasar lifetimes .",
    "they also predict that the relative bias of quasars to galaxies should be roughly scale - independent on scales @xmath157 , but rises on smaller scales due to merging events .",
    "their model indicates that the relative bias of quasars to galaxies decreases at higher redshift and is @xmath28 at @xmath156 , in accord with the results presented here .",
    "recent measurements of the quasar auto - correlation function do not show a strong dependence of clustering on luminosity @xcite , which may be problematic for this paradigm , although the errors on the observations are still large enough ( @xmath1330% in the 2df data ) to be consistent with its predictions .",
    "more recently , @xcite present an alternative model for quasar lifetimes in which bright and faint quasars are in similar physical systems but are in different stages of their life cycles .",
    "this work is inspired by numerical simulations of galaxy mergers @xcite which incorporate black hole growth and feedback . whereas the @xcite model assumes an exponential decline of the quasar luminosity with time , in the @xcite scenario",
    "quasars spend more time on the lower - luminosity end of their light curves .",
    "the hopkins et al .",
    "approach is also able to explain both the optical and x - ray quasar luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "@xcite build on this model , postulating from simulations that halo mass is strongly correlated with the peak quasar luminosity , but only indirectly connected to the highly variable instantaneous luminosity .",
    "this leads to predictions that faint and bright quasars reside in similar ",
    "mass dark matter halos and that quasar clustering should depend only weakly on luminosity .",
    "based on this hypothesis , they estimate the mass distribution of dark matter halos that host active quasars at @xmath158 and the characteristic dark matter halo masses of active quasars at @xmath159 from the observed quasar luminosity function .",
    "their model interprets the observed luminosity evolution of quasars as a slow downsizing in the quasar population from @xmath158 to @xmath95 , in that at lower redshifts less massive halos host active quasars . at @xmath156 ,",
    "the characteristic parent halo mass ( defined as the peak of the lognormal distribution ) is estimated to be @xmath160 , broadly consistent with our results though somewhat higher than what we find here . however , from the inferred halo mass distribution of quasars they predict that the mean quasar bias at @xmath156 will be @xmath161 ( for @xmath135 ) , significantly different from our measurement .",
    "in contrast , the semi - analytic model of @xcite combines the @xcite prescription of merger - driven black hole growth with an independent low energy ` radio mode ' heating mechanism efficient at late times .",
    "because this model assumes that some fraction of cold gas must be present to trigger a ` quasar ' phase during a galaxy merger , gas - free galaxies are not expected to shine as quasars .",
    "thus , this model predicts that active quasars should only occur below a maximum dark matter halo mass where the heating mechanism has yet to switch on , the so - called quenching mass. above the quenching mass , gas in the igm will be hot enough to suppress the infall of new cold gas onto galaxies , so that black holes are only fed slowly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "common , group - scale halos will generally pass this mass threshold ( @xmath162 ) at @xmath163 . at lower redshifts , then , only those mergers which occur outside of group environments will contain the requisite cold gas to fuel a strong agn .",
    "simply put , in this scenario quasar activity is quenched in dense environments for much the same reasons that star formation is , and our finding that quasars at @xmath3 cluster very similarly to bright star - forming galaxies at the same redshifts is not necessarily surprising .",
    "our findings support a picture where quasars at @xmath3 are a transient phase in the life of normal galaxies , given that they cluster similarly .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that * all * galaxies have hosted a quasar at some point , however , but just that the galaxies that do at @xmath129 are found in fairly typical dark matter halos .",
    "@xcite compare the observed abundance of quasars to the number density of dark matter halos with masses corresponding to the observed clustering properties ; they conclude that at @xmath156 only 1% of all potential host dark matter halos actually harbor a quasar .",
    "a direct comparison of the quasar number density derived from the 2df qso luminosity function @xcite at @xmath164 to the number density of deep2 galaxies @xcite leads to the conclusion that roughly one out of every @xmath165 deep2 galaxies hosts a quasar with @xmath35 , and twice as many host a quasar with @xmath166 .    if quasars are fueled by galaxy mergers , then the clustering amplitude on small scales ( @xmath167 ) should rise relative to large scales .",
    "there is no significant scale - dependence seen for the scales investigated here ( @xmath1 ) , but @xcite find that on scales @xmath168 there is a strong increase in the quasar clustering amplitude above a power - law extrapolation in the range @xmath169 .",
    "similarly , a small scale excess of l@xmath170 galaxies was detected around low redshift ( @xmath171 ) agn by @xcite .",
    "our quasar sample is too small to provide clustering measures with reasonable errors on these scales and so we are not able to address this question here ( there are only a total of 5 galaxies contributing to the smallest @xmath80 bin shown ) .",
    "however , the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function is much better suited to address such small - scale behavior than the quasar auto - correlation function , as the galaxy population has a much higher number density than the quasar population .",
    "much improved statistics could be obtained by surveying the galaxy population densely in the neighborhood of known quasars .",
    "models that propose that major mergers between blue galaxies fuel quasars , which in turn quench star - formation and lead to the formation of red - sequence galaxies , have to match the observed clustering of quasars relative to galaxies .",
    "we find evidence that quasars cluster more like blue galaxies than red , which may pose a problem if most red galaxies form rapidly from quasars .",
    "if quasars are in blue galaxies that will soon migrate to the red sequence , then we might expect them to have an intermediate clustering amplitude between the average blue and red galaxy populations , which is consistent with , but not favored by , our findings .",
    "one could better reconcile the data with these models if different subsets of the red galaxy population have different clustering ; e.g. , older red galaxies may be more clustered than galaxies that have recently undergone a quasar phase and joined the red sequence .",
    "we note , however , that both the deep2 and combo-17 surveys find that the red sequence population grows rapidly from @xmath129 to @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the red sequence population is dominated by number by relatively young galaxies at @xmath129 ; this is also found from stellar population measurements by @xcite .",
    "this then requires that the rare , older red sequence galaxies must be that much more strongly clustered than younger ones to match their observed overall correlation function .    in this paper",
    "we have used a relatively small quasar sample ( 52 objects ) to show that quasars have comparable clustering properties and reside in similar environments and dark matter halos as deep2 galaxies .",
    "we find tentative ( @xmath5 ) evidence that the quasar clustering amplitude matches that of blue galaxies at @xmath3 more than red galaxies , and that quasars are only modestly biased relative to dark matter ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "this paper shows the potential of cross - correlation techniques and points the way to future studies .",
    "we hope to improve on these results using additional quasars that are spectroscopically confirmed in the deep2 fields , particularly radio and x - ray sources identified in the extended groth strip , a deep2 field with considerable multi - wavelength data . with smaller measurement errors we may be able to distinguish between different models of quasar formation and evolution , as discussed above .",
