    "in a companion paper , @xcite we investigated level correlations in a modified kepler ( mk ) problem and discovered two important effects : quantum - hall - like jumps in the saturation level rigidity as a function of running energy and persistent oscillations of the level number variance as a function of the interval width . unlike rectangular billiards ( rb ) , @xcite where superposition of a number of incommensurate harmonics led to a finite lower limit of the variance , in the modified kepler problem the level variance can achieve near zero values .    in other words",
