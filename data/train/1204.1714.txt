    "there are two dynamical realizations of inflation : in the standard inflation scenario known as _ supercooled inflation _ , radiation is red - shifted during expansion and a vacuum dominated universe is the result of this exponential expansion .",

    ", a reheating period is needed to fill the universe with radiation .",
    "this model separates expansion and reheating into two distinguished time periods . however , energy transfer from potential energy to radiation is a nontrivial aspect of this supercooled inflation . as a second alternative , _",
    "warm inflation _ proposed firstly by berrera , is a successful scenario to overcome this difficulty @xcite . in this scenario , due to inflaton interactions with other fields ,",
    "dissipative effects arise so that radiation production occurs concurrently with exponential expansion .",
    "several mechanisms for implementing such a dissipation during inflation have been proposed @xcite .",
    "for instance , a permanent or temporary coupling of the scalar field with other fields can lead to dissipative effects producing entropy at different eras of inflationary stage .",
    "in warm inflation proposal , matter and radiation energy fluctuations , which are responsible for temperature fluctuations , are treated separately .",
    "matter fields interact with particles that are in a thermal bath with mean temperature smaller than grand unified theories ( gut ) critical temperature @xcite .",
    "although this scenario is successful enough , it suffers from difficulties such as unjustified initial thermal bath which is needed to be introduced in the framework of chaotic inflation",
    ". one important feature of the inflationary paradigm is the fact that inflaton can interact with other fields such as gravitational sector of the theory .",
    "this interaction is shown by the non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and ricci scalar in the spirit of the scalar - tensor theories .",
    "in fact , there are several compelling reasons for inclusion of an explicit non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and gravity in the action .",
    "for instance , non - minimal coupling arises at the quantum level when quantum corrections to the scalar field theory are considered . even if for the classical , unperturbed theory this non - minimal coupling vanishes , it is necessary for the renormalizability of the scalar field theory in curved space . in most theories used to describe inflationary scenarios ,",
    "it turns out that a non - vanishing value of the coupling constant can not be avoided .",
    "also , in general relativity , and in all other metric theories of gravity in which the scalar field is not part of the gravitational sector , the coupling constant necessarily assumes the value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to study an extension of the warm inflation proposal that contains explicit non - minimal coupling of the scalar field and gravity .",
    "we call this extension as _ non - minimal warm inflation_. although this issue has been considered by some authors , but there are very limited number of studies in this direction @xcite .",

    "finally , a point should be stressed about the issue of frames in our setup .",
    "there is a conformal transformation which transforms the action ( 1 ) ( which is written in the jordan frame ) to corresponding action in the einstein frame . in the einstein frame ,",
    "the gravitational sector is expressed in terms of a re - scaled scalar field which is minimally coupled and evolves in a re - scaled potential , thereby simplifying the formalism .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the matter sector is strongly affected by such a conformal transformation since all of the matter fields are now non - minimally coupled to the re - scaled metric : in particular , stress tensor conservation in the matter sector is no longer ensured @xcite . on the other hand , as makino and sasaki @xcite and fakir _",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown , the amplitude of scalar perturbation in the jordan frame exactly coincides with that in the einstein frame .",
    "this proof ( for details see @xcite ) allows us to calculate the scalar power spectrum in the jordan and einstein frame . as a result",
    ", the scalar power spectrum has no dependence on the choice of frames , i.e. , it is conformally invariant .",
    "so , our results can be compared to observations directly without any ambiguities @xcite .",
    "this is an important point since one has to check validity of non - gravity experiments in einstein frame .",
    "for instance , validity of electro - magnetic related experiments such as cmb experiment should be checked in einstein frame . as komatsu and futamase",
    "have shown , the scalar power spectrum is independent on the choice of frames @xcite .",
    "we terminate this section by pointing that from a statistical mechanics viewpoint , the interaction between quantum fields and a thermal bath in this warm inflation scenario could be illustrated by a general fluctuation - dissipation relation ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "warm inflation was criticized on the basis that the inflaton can not decay during the slow - roll phase @xcite . however , in recent years , it has been shown that the inflaton can indeed decay during the slow - roll phase and now this scenario rests on solid theoretical grounds ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    ", one has @xmath167 . at the end of the inflationary phase however , universe is radiation dominated and",
    "therefore inflation sustains vacuum energy density along expansion of scale factor and at the time of the end of inflation universe enters to the radiation dominated era .",
    "this mean that after the end of inflation the universe is radiation dominated but the inflaton field retains some of its potential energy , because the inflaton condensate does not need to decay to reheat inflation .",
    "in inflationary paradigm , inflaton can interact with other fields such as ricci curvature .",
    "this interaction is shown by the non - minimal coupling ( nmc ) of the inflaton and gravity in the action of the scenario .",
    "there are many compelling reasons to include an explicit non - minimal coupling in the action .",

    "we have studied warm inflation by incorporating an explicit non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and gravity on the normal branch of a warped dgp brane.we have studied also parameter space of the model in high dissipation and high energy limits . as we have shown , this model provides natural exit from the inflationary phase without adopting any additional mechanism(s ) for appropriate values of the non - minimal coupling . by a numerical analysis in this case",
    ", we have shown that incorporation of the non - minimal coupling in this setup decreases the number of e - folds relative to the minimal case .",
    "we emphasize however that this result is sensitive to the details of the model parameters such the dissipation function , scalar field potential and the non - minimal coupling . a qualitative confrontation with wmap7+bao+@xmath141",
    "combined data shows that this model in high dissipation limit gives a red and nearly scale invariant power spectrum for positive values of the non - minimal coupling . from another viewpoint , comparison of this non - minimal warm inflation model with observational data",
    "could provide more accurate constraints on the values of the non - minimal coupling .",
    "since we have calculated the first order contributions in slow - roll parameters , our results are valid in both jordan and einstein frame . however , higher order corrections could lead to different results in these two frames ."
