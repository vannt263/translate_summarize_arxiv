    "the theory of magnetic reconnection is an important tool for explaining the trigger and energy release processes for solar flares and other eruptions .",
    "highly twisted structures of an emerging magnetic system are usually thought to be an omen of high level flare productivity @xcite , and the properties of the twist can be revealed partly from observations of the vector magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recently , helicity related research has become a hot topic in solar physics , not only because of questions of its origin , transfer and conservation from inside the sun out into the corona , but also because of its role in solar flares .",
    "theories and numerical simulations have thoroughly investigated and demonstrated the process of reconnection between magnetic flux loops of different chirality ( handedness ) @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the collision between two counter - helical ropes , i.e. , a right- and a left - handed flux tube , is most ideally suited for reconnection @xcite .",
    ", based on 3d numerical simulations , show that the reconnection between large - scale oppositely sheared loops in a coronal arcade can trigger solar flares .",
    "observationally , the appearance of opposite sign for helicity flux in flare - productive active regions has been noted @xcite , but their relationship to the reconstruction of the magnetic field is still not clear . thus far , there has been no reliable evidence from observations supporting a strong tendency for counter - helical reconnection to result in major flares .    on 2003 oct .",
    "29 , in the decaying period of solar cycle 23 , a large flare classed 2b / x10 occurred in super ar 10486 which produced a series of major flares during its passage on the solar disc .",
    "the flare started at 20:37 ut and reached its maximum at 20:49 ut seen from goes soft x - ray flux profile .",
    "our observations reveal that the major flare on oct .",
    "29 had a close relationship with the reciprocal action between counter - helical fluxes .",
    "it may be the first observational evidence for counter - helical reconnection playing an important role in the triggering of a major flare . in ",
    "2 we detail the observations and present the results , then , in  3 we present a summary and discussion of the findings .",
    "the vector magnetograms were taken by the hsos solar magnetic field telescope ( smft ) at fei @xmath1 5324.19   @xcite and mso imaging vector magnetograph ( ivm ) at fei @xmath1 6302.5   @xcite .",
    "the smft / hsos was designed to measure the line - of - sight component in the band wing -0.075   off the center and the transverse component in the line center , in order to reduce the cross - talk effect .",
    "a new 6701-type ccd system ( 640 @xmath2 480 pixels ) was installed at hsos in 2001 october with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath3 resulting in a practical image scale of about @xmath4 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the ivm / mso is a stokes profile analyzing magnetograph and can supply real - time polarization data for vector magnetic field measurement .",
    "compared in detail the photospheric transverse fields between ivm and smft for a simple sunspot , and found only a small statistical difference as 3.0 degree . in this work",
    "there are 12 sets of vector magnetograms from hsos are used , which were chosen because of relatively better seeing conditions , including 8 sets on oct . 29 ( 01 - 07 ut ) and 4 sets on oct .",
    "30 ( 01 - 05 ut ) .",
    "moreover , 5 additional vector magnetograms were supplied by ivm / mso observations which covered the 2b / x10 flare that occurred from 20:37 ut to 21:01 ut on 2003 oct .",
    "29 when ar 10486 was located ( s@xmath6 , w@xmath7 ) on the central meridian of the solar disc .",
    "for both hsos and mees data the longitudinal magnetic component ( @xmath8 ) and the transverse components ( @xmath9 ) are derived directly from stokes parameters .",
    "the 180 degree ambiguity is resolved by using the reference potential - field method , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the observed transverse field vector and @xmath12 is the potential - model calculated vector on the photosphere . in the data pre - processing",
    ", we set the value thresholds on the longitudinal magnetic field component ( @xmath13 g ) and on the transverse magnetic field components ( @xmath14 g ) .",
    "the 50100 kev hard x - ray ( hxr ) data used in the work are provided by _ rhessi _ @xcite .",
    "hxr image is integrated from 20:45:30 to 20:46:30 ut and constructed with the clean alogrithm with a @xmath15 fwhm resolution ( using _ rhessi _ grids 3 - 9 ) .",
    "the non - thermal sources ( @xmath16 20 kev ) indicated by the hxr data suggest the locations of the footpoints of the reconnected loops along which the accelerated electrons / ions passed before colliding with the ambient solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the other data sets , including h@xmath17 and euv observations , are presented in @xcite .",
    "the multi - wavelengths data in movie form are available in the electronic version of the paper .",
    "they are useful for clear demonstration of the flare core evolution and the global effects of the x10 flare event .",
    "the h@xmath17 movie shows remote brightenings more than @xmath18 km away from the main flare in eastern and southern directions .",
    "the remote brightenings were found cotemporal with the two phases of the flare emissions ( before and after @xmath19 20:49 ut ) , respectively , as observed at hxr and radio wavelengths . also , coronal dimmings at euv wavelength were found at the locus of the remote brightenings right after the flare .",
    "figure 1 shows an example hsos vector magnetogram taken at 05:43 ut , 2003 oct .",
    "note that the actual size of the active region is larger than the observed fov , but figure 1 displays the main portion of the sunspot group and contains the most important spots of interest .",
    "high shear is clearly seen in the transverse fields at the top left of the magnetic neutral line .",
    "another feature of the ar is the intrusion of a slender negative flux region into the positive field , as shown in the top region in the image , which could be one important cause of the highly sheared morphology formed there .    as a comparison , the longitudinal current ( @xmath20 ) distributions on oct .",
    "29 and oct .",
    "30 deduced from the vector magnetograms ( @xmath21 ) ) are shown in the left column of figure 2 .",
    "the grey images superposed are the corresponding longitudinal magnetograms .",
    "it seems that the current system of this region is running out from the region surrounding the main sunspots and then downward through them .",
    "the corresponding current helicity density results ( @xmath22 ) are shown in the right column of figure 2 .",
    "the current helicity density is obtained from @xmath23 . obviously , the flux in the fov is a mixture of both positive and negative @xmath22 .",
    "the main sunspots are dominated by negative helicity density , i.e. , left - handed twisted . however , some positive @xmath22 patches , i.e. , right - hand twisted , exist around or even inside the main sunspots .",
    "these opposite - sign @xmath22 patches are long - lived features as it is shown from figure 3 . from oct .",
    "29 to 30 , a decrease is evident for both the positive and negative @xmath22 ( compare c - d in figure 2 ) .",
    "some weaker positive @xmath22 patches disappear in the density map of oct .",
    "we show in figure 3 more details of the evolution of @xmath22 in the two days with 12 vector magnetograms by hsos and mees . in figure 3a , four long - lived positive @xmath22 patches marked with ` a - d ' are identified .",
    "the region of dominant negative @xmath22 is marked with ` sunspot ' since it is the umbra of the main sunspots in the white light image in figure 1 . between oct .",
    "29 and 30 , ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' underwent obvious evolution , while on the contrary ` d ' did not . unlike ` a ' and ` b ' , region ` c ' resides inside one of the sunspots .",
    "as ` b ' disappears , ` a ' still exists in the @xmath22 maps of oct .",
    "30 even although it has greatly decreased , while the patch ` c ' has changed into a weak signal and is sometimes hardly detected ( e.g. figure 3l ) .",
    "figure 3i - j are the images just taken before and after the large flare by ivm and the features marked in figure 3a can also be identified here . taken into account the time difference ( 11 hours between figure 3h - hsos and figure 3i - mso ) , some new features shown in figure",
    "3i could be attributed to the long time evolution of the active region .",
    "however , the reality of a new positive @xmath22 patch arrowed in figure 3j is thought questionable .",
    "the quantitative results of the @xmath24 evolution are shown in figure 4 for the typical patches ` a ' , ` sunspot ' and the positive and negative regions of the fov , respectively .",
    "the peak time of the x10 flare is indicated by the impulsive rise of the sxr flux in each panel . before the major flare ,",
    "a continuous increase in @xmath24 is a common tendency among the four regions .",
    "however , after the flare time , the values of @xmath24 are suddenly reduced to a relatively lower level .",
    "the scales of these large decreases in @xmath24 are 51% ( figure 4a - c ) and 44% ( figure 4d ) .",
    "if the current helicity measurements based on the sfmt and ivm data are trustworthy , then such an abnormal decrease of @xmath24 in the active region should suggest that the magnetic flux loops have been untwisted in an effective way which may have a close relationship with the x10 flare .",
    "figure 5a is an enlargement of figure 3h , in which the contours of the patches ` a - c ' are indicated .",
    "the _ rhessi _",
    "50 - 100 kev hxr contours are superposed in white on this @xmath22 map in figure 5b .",
    "the hxr data are integrated over a time period of 1 minute ( 20:45:30 20:46:30 ut ) , and the overlying contour levels are 10% , 20% , 40% , 70% and 90% of the maximum .",
    "two obvious hxr cores are adjacent to ` b ' and ` c ' , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to find that the weaker footpoint corresponds to the stronger patch ` c ' , while the stronger footpoint corresponds to the weaker patch ` b ' . from the hxr movie ( see electronic version ) , the footpoints over ` b ' and ` c ' show a primary separating motion during the flare and the positions of the hxr cores are a snapshot near the flare peak time . in figure 5b",
    ", there is also one weak hxr emission over the large positive helicity patch ` a ' at 20:45 ut , but this weak emission lasted only one minute during the whole flare period ( 20:37 - 21:01 ut ) , thus we think it might be a thermal effect caused by the remote flaring ribbons .",
    "during the decaying period of solar cycle 23 , in 2003 october , several x - class flares occurred in ar 10486 .",
    "one of the flares , 2b / x10 on oct .",
    "29 , is found to be associated with significant current helicity ( @xmath22 ) changes in the whole active region based on the vector magnetograms taken by huairou solar observing station and mees solar observatory .",
    "three long - lived helical flux patches ( @xmath25 ) have a significantly reduced @xmath22 after the major flare .",
    "they were located either compactly around the main sunspots or resided just inside them .",
    "in addition , two _ rhessi _ hxr footpoints appeared during the flare and they had a one to one correspondence with the two weaker helical patches ( b and c ) . after the flare , these two patches disappeared , and the third patch ( a ) was found to decay in @xmath24 by @xmath26% .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 of the main sunspots also decreased by half .",
    "in fact , before the major flare , the @xmath24 of the active region kept increasing at a high rate ( figure 4 ) , which may indicate fresh twisted flux emerging from below .",
    "as an evidence , reported flux emergence and continuous sunspot rotation until the time of the flare in a way to increase the overall twist of the active region field before the major flare .",
    "after the flare , the amount of both the positive and negative helicity was found to decrease by about the same level , @xmath1950% , suggesting some ` cancellation ' between them .",
    "reported observations of a @xmath27 spot evolution in another super ar 9077 .",
    "they found that helicity reversal of one spot in the @xmath27 group had a close relation with their group disintegration , and that the helicity reversal might result from the emergence of opposite - sign helical flux .",
    "different from the case analyzed in this paper , they could not find obvious change in @xmath24 in the whole active region .",
    "in this case of the 29 - 30 october , both the positive and negative current helicities partly cancel each other resulting in a reduction of the twist of the whole system .",
    "several authors investigated in detail the relationship between vertical current distributions and flare kernels @xcite . by using high resolution hxr data and vector magnetograms , further pointed out that non - thermal electron accelerations usually take place adjacent to pre - existing current system observed at the photospheric level , i.e. , flares occur between different set of magnetic connectivities . in this work ,",
    "we study the current helicity density instead of the current density for the convenience of identification of different helical flux systems . in ar 10486 ,",
    "the locations of the hxr footpoints are found to be adjacent to the helicity patches ( ` b ' , ` c ' , in figure 5 ) , confirming the previous study @xcite and suggesting the reconnection occurred between left - handed and right - handed magnetic fluxes .",
    "cancellation of counter - helical fluxes has been simulated by who demonstrated how counter - helical fluxes reconnect and release the non - potential energy .",
    "one important finding in the simulations is that the transverse ( azimuthal ) fields will reconnect and then tie the flux loops together , thus pulling them closer to each other and allowing further reconnection to take place .",
    "this is a special feature of reconnection of counter - helical fluxes and such a type of reconnection is the ` most efficient reconnection ' for major flare production @xcite .",
    "one result of counter - helical reconnection is the untwisting of the flux loops , i.e. , the decrease of the transverse components , which helps to decay the system @xmath24 .",
    "the sudden disappearance of the penumbra for sunspots in ar10486 ( corresponding to ` b ' , figure 3 ) was found to be associated with the occurrence of the x10 flare @xcite , directly supporting the suggestion of decay of the transverse fields .",
    "also , the moreton waves and the type ii radio bursts in this event were generated in a wide directional range @xcite , as one should expect if the reconnection occurred in a way to unwind the magnetic helicity . before adding the ivm / mees data",
    ", it could be suspicious that the substantial current helicity changes , observed not only in small spatial scale but in large scale in the active region , were possibly due to the system noises ( e.g. , by instrument resettings and changing seeing conditions at hsos during a period of two days ) .",
    "the complementary ivm data just cover the important period before and after the large flare , and the raw data have been corrected for the terrestrial atmosphere and the instrument systematic effects .",
    "the hsos and mees data jointly allow us to examine the successive evolution of the active region . therefore , based on the above discussion",
    ", it is strongly suggested that the x10 flare event is triggered by reconnection between the counter - helical flux systems in the corona .",
    "it may be the first observational evidence for reconnection between counter - helical tubes triggering major flares , although there is a large data gap between the magnetograms and the hxr data .",
    "there was a halo cme associated with the x10 flare .",
    "the large - scale activities have been studied by .",
    "the results from the multi - wavelength full - disk data analysis indicate salient magnetic field re - organizations in the corona due to the large - scale magnetic reconnection in the corona ( as evidenced by the remote flare brightenings ) that gave rise to the halo cme .",
    "the active region 10486 is just the source region that launched the fast halo cme .",
    "the radio , h@xmath17 , euv , hxr movies are available as the electronic material of the paper . for the global current helicity decrease in the whole active region , we think the released halo cme should have taken away significant free helicity / energy from its source region , while the magnetic cancellations between the counter - helical fluxes played a trigger mechanism for the cme initiation .    on the other hand , as it has been shown , the vector magnetogram data in combination with other wavelength observations is a powerful tool for solar physics research .",
    "it is a pity that there is no vector data for the period of another flare , or poor seeing conditions at that time , since a series of x - class flares occurred in ar 10486 .",
    "it should be noted that linton s simulation applies in the convective zone with confined flux tubes in high plasma beta , it is unclear that whether the same physics is applicable in the solar corona .",
    "the case presented here suggests the magnetic reconnection between counter - helical flux could work in the corona .",
    "we are expecting that the hinode will be able to supply more convincing evidence by providing continuous high spatial and temporal resolution vector magnetograms , and overcome the significant limitations of the ground - based observations .",
