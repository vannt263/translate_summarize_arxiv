    "more than 260 r1408 pmts were obtained from uc irvine , these pmts were used in imb@xcite and superkamoika@xcite experiments .",
    "these 13 stages , 8 inches , r1408 pmts do nt have a single photo - electron peak and the cause of that is expected to be due to their venetian blind dynodes .",
    "the aim of the testing performed at drexel university was to be sure that most of these pmts are still working correctly , and then make a choice of 156 of them .",
    "the testing concerned the determination of the high voltage corresponding to a gain of @xmath0 , saturation level and the dark noise rate . to make this testing different calibration techniques were used , the photo - statistics and the light pulser methods .",
    "most of these pmts came with their original linear bases , a first testing of 250 pmts was made with these bases , after that a new testing was performed with a new tapered bases .",
    "in this section i will summarize the principle of the photo - statistics method .",
    "+ with an adc we are not measuring a charge q directly , but an adc value a that is related to q by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the adc pedestal .",
    "as it can be demonstrated , the gain can be extracted via the following relation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mean and the variance of adc charge distribution , and ge is the adc count per photo - electron , called also gain / channel , with @xmath6 .",
    "all we need is to take a series of led / laser runs at varying light levels , and for each of these runs to measure the statistical mean and variance of spectra as shown in figure [ cap : led - pulse - pmt33 ] , after that plot the variance versus the mean , and fit the linear region with a straight line like in figure [ cap : pmt33-gain ] .",
    "the gain will be extracted from the slope of the line following the equation [ gain ] .",
    "one important feature of this method is it is electronics pedestal independent , to get the absolute gain one needs to multiply the gain / channel by the adc coefficient calibration . to obtain the saturation level",
    "i consider the point after the linearity of pmt response is broken , the ratio of the adc mean at the considered point and the gain / channel gives the saturation level in the number of photo - electrons , figure [ cap : pmt33-gain ] shows an example of this procedure .",
    "since the saturation level is determined by eyes it becomes human dependent , two measurements performed by two different persons may give different values .",
    "+        an @xmath7 @xmath8 source is fixed on a nai crystal .",
    "the choice of the crystal is very important in the way that it will let the emitted @xmath8 particles to have a uniform energy loss which allows the production of monochromatic photons inside the scintillator .",
    "the scintillator crystal chosen for the present measurements is nai(tl ) , the @xmath8 peak appears at an equivalent @xmath9 ray energy of 2.6 mev .",
    "the table [ cap : alpha source ] summarizes the characteristics of the used am pulser .",

    "different methods were used to make the testing of 250 r1408 pmts fast and more accurate , during this testing different type of bases were used , the new tapered bases gave good saturation performance 2 to 3 times better than the new linear bases , at the same gain(i.e .",
    "the same high voltage ) .",
    "however , at the same high voltage the pmt gain remains the same with the linear and the tapered bases .",
    "based on the results of this testing , 156 pmts were selected to be used for the inner veto of the double chooz detectors .",
