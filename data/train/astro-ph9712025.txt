    "multiplicity plays an essential , though as yet poorly understood , role in the formation and maybe the evolution of a - type chemically peculiar stars .",
    "while the rate of binaries tends to be rather small among the magnetic ap stars , with an especially strong deficit of sb2 binaries , it is very high among the am stars , which on the contrary , are very often found in sb2 systems .",
    "there is also a conspicuous lack of orbital periods smaller than 3 days among the magnetic ap stars , as shown e.g. in the review by gerbaldi et al .",
    "the multiplicity of am stars has been explored by abt & levy ( 1985 ) , and their work showed that all am stars are not necessarily found in binaries ( contrary to what earlier results suggested ) , or at least not in short - period binaries ( even though `` short '' means @xmath1 days ) .",
    "this indicates that duplicity is not an absolute prerequisite for the am peculiarity to appear , so that the slow rotation of these stars , which presumably allows radiative diffusion to work in their atmosphere ( michaud et al . 1983 ) , is not always due to tidal friction ( abt 1985 , abt & levy 1985 ) .    in order to increase the as yet insufficient statistics , a radial velocity survey of cool ,",
    "magnetic ap stars has been initiated in 1985 using the coravel scanner .",
    "some am stars were also monitored in the course of this programme , for ambiguous classification caused them to be considered as ap stars .",
    "preliminary results of this survey have been published by north ( 1994 ) .",
    "observations of am stars with coravel had been initiated in the early eighties by m. mayor and w. benz , with the purpose of determining their projected rotational velocities , but the results were not published .",
    "since this project was not intended to determine the rate of binaries , only few stars have more than 2 or 3 measurements , and hd 96391 was one of them .",
    "in 1992 , two of us ( jmc and ng ) began a radial - velocity survey of all northern am stars whose metallic type is cooler than or equal to f2 , with the purpose of improving our knowledge of their multiplicity .",
    "the limit imposed on the spectral type deduced from the metallic lines was chosen because of coravel s optimum efficiency for cool stars .",
    "the stars hd 43478 and 96391 were included in this survey and were therefore measured independently by the geneva - lausanne observers as well as by the toulouse observers .",
    "the latter measured also a few ap stars , and we present here the results based on the merged data of these common stars .    the observations are briefly described in section 2 while the results are presented and discussed in sections 3 and 4 for the ap and am stars respectively .",
    "extensive use has been made of renson s ( 1991 ) catalogue in this work .",
    "the radial velocity observations were done at observatoire de haute - provence with the coravel scanner attached to the 1-meter swiss telescope .",
    "although this instrument is optimized for late - type stars , it can still yield very good results on slowly rotating f stars , and even on a stars if their metallic lines are enhanced , as is the case of ap and am stars . some ap and am stars",
    "have been measured as early as 1980 , but more systematic surveys began in 1985 and in 1992 for the ap and am stars respectively .",
    "the photometric observations were made in the geneva system at different observing sites ( observatoire de haute - provence , gornergrat and jungfraujoch ) , but most observations of hd 43478 were made at jungfraujoch ( switzerland ) with the 76-cm telescope .",
    "the individual radial velocities of all stars , as well as individual photometric measurements of hd 43478 , are listed in tables 6 to 12 .",
    "this bright a2 sr star was already known as an sb1 system .",
    "its rotational period , known from its photometric variability , is 69.43 days ( rakosch & fiedler 1978 ) . renson ( 1966 ) found an orbital period of 106.3 days and published the radial - velocity curve , but not the orbital parameters .",
    "a total of 107 measurements have been made over almost 5000 days ( table  6 ) , which confirms the 106 days period ( see fig .  1 )",
    ". however , the residuals are larger than expected from the precision of the measurements , and follow a very clear trend ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the presence of a third component is certain , although its period is so long that we could not cover even one cycle .",
    "the orbital parameters of the primary are given in table  1 .",
    "this is the second spectroscopic triple system known among ap stars , after the simg star hd 201433 whose periods are much shorter ( see the catalogue of tokovinin 1997 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     a summary of the physical parameters of the hd 43478 system is given in table  5 .",
    "the bolometric correction has been taken from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "the distance is shorter than indicated by the hipparcos satellite , which gave @xmath2 mas or @xmath3 pc ; however , the discrepancy can not be considered significant since it remains largely within two sigmas .",
    "the distance deduced from the fundamental radii and photometric effective temperatures is almost twice more accurate than that given by hipparcos ( the error has been estimated using the usual propagation formula applied to the distance modulus ) .",
    "it is interesting that the fundamental @xmath4 value we find for the primary , which is quite reliable , is in excellent agreement with the value obtained from both geneva and @xmath5 colour indices .",
    "the situation of both components in the hr diagram is shown in figure 9 , together with @xmath6 evolutionary tracks interpolated in those of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and isochrones with ages @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the primary is clearly at the end of its life on the main sequence , and the secondary is probably somewhat evolved too . in view of the shape of the isochrones",
    ", one can easily understand why the secondary is slightly hotter than the primary .",
    "clearly , a more complete and precise lightcurve is needed , especially to give a more accurate , fundamental estimate of the radii and to assess thereby the validity of the assumption of synchronism .",
    "this star was classified a4-f0-f3 by abt ( 1984 ) .",
    "it is also an sb2 system with very similar companions .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have geneva photometry for that star , but strmgren photometry = 0.225 , @xmath9 = 0.656 , v = 7.08 ] done by olsen ( 1983 ) and retrieved using the general catalogue of photometric data ( mermilliod et al .",
    "1997 ) gives @xmath10 , @xmath11 through the calibration of moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) , and @xmath12@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 through older calibrations included in moon s ( 1985 ) code .",
    "we have 36 coravel observations of this star ( tables  11 and 12 ) ; the orbital elements are listed in table  1 and the @xmath18 value of each component is given in table  2 .",
    "the @xmath19 angle remains unknown , since that star is not known as an eclipsing binary .    on the other hand ,",
    "the hipparcos parallax is @xmath20 mas , which implies a distance @xmath21 pc taking into account the lutz - kelker correction -0.07 .",
    "furthermore , from the reddening maps of lucke ( 1978 ) , a colour excess @xmath22 appears reasonable , so we adopt @xmath23 ; to correct for the duplicity , the apparent visual magnitude is increased by 0.75 mag ( so the result will relate to an average component ) , and one obtains @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and by interpolation in theoretical evolutionary tracks , @xmath26 dex , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath4 value obtained here with that given by the @xmath29 photometry is excellent ( the photometric luminosity is far off , but is obtained through an older calibration ) . once again , this system appears close to the end of its life on the main sequence .",
    "it is now possible to estimate the orbital inclination @xmath19 by comparing @xmath30 with @xmath31 and the result is @xmath32 .",
    "this precludes eclipses , which would need an orbital inclination larger than @xmath33 to occur .",
    "the individual masses are about @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the average equatorial velocity computed from the radius obtained above and from the assumption of synchronism is 27.7 kms@xmath36 , which translates into @xmath37 kms@xmath36 .",
    "this value may be compared with the observed @xmath18 s of both companions ( table 2 ) , if the spin axes are perpendicular to the orbital plane : the observed values are smaller than those predicted by synchronism via the radius estimate , but the @xmath38 error on the latter is large enough to accomodate both results within two @xmath39 .",
    "the system is very probably synchronised .",
    "we have shown that the cool ap star hd 8441 belongs to a triple system , whose ratio of the long to the short period is larger than 47 .",
    "we could improve the knowledge of the orbit of the classical ap star @xmath0 crb thanks to our new , highly homogeneous radial velocities which could be combined with the published speckle orbit .",
    "furthermore , the individual masses of the components could be determined thanks to the hipparcos parallax .",
    "the masses of both components of the am star hd 43478 could be obtained with 1% accuracy thanks to the eclipsing nature of the system .",
    "the radii are less precisely known , because of the shallowness of the eclipses and the insufficient photometric data .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption of synchronism combined with the present data leads to a very good match of both components with the isochrone @xmath40 , and the evolved state of at least the primary clearly appears even without this assumption .",
    "it would be worthwhile to make further photometric observations of this system , in order to obtain a better estimate of the radii and to tell whether it is synchronized or not .",
    "spectroscopic observations should also be done in order to constrain the luminosity ratio and the individual effective temperatures .",
    "all four binaries examined here have at least one component ( the primary ) which is significantly evolved and will leave the main sequence within a short time , relatively to its ms lifetime .",
    "the rotational period of both components is very probably synchronised with the orbital period in the two systems hosting am stars .",
