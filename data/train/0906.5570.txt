    "( [ eq : k_rg ] ) ) , sizable deviations from the predictions for an isolated wire@xcite @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is the bare stiffness , could be achieved at low enough temperatures .    in summary , we have studied a thin superconducting wire weakly coupled to a metallic film , focusing on the details of dissipation provided by the metallic cooperons at low temperatures .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram at @xmath0 within the framework of renormalization group and a variational harmonic approximation .",
    "we predict a quantum phase transition towards a superconductor with long - range order at @xmath0 as a function of the andreev conductance @xmath117 and the superconducting stiffness @xmath68 of the wire .",
