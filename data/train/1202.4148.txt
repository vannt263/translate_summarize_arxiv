    "since formulated by m.dehn in the early 1910 s the word problem and conjugacy problem in finitely presented groups have become fundamental problems in combinatorial group theory . following the work of novikov @xcite and further authors on their general unsolvability , it has become fairly natural to ask for any finitely presented group whether it admits a solution or not .",
    "for example in @xcite , dehn has solved those problems for fundamental groups of closed surfaces ; his motivation was topological . given a finite presentation of a group @xmath1 , a solution to the _ word problem _ is an algorithm which given two elements @xmath2 as words in the generators and their inverses , decides whether @xmath3 in @xmath1 other not .",
    "a solution to the _ conjugacy problem _ is an algorithm which given @xmath2 decides whether @xmath4 such that @xmath5 in @xmath1 other not .",
    "it turns out that existence of solutions does not depend of the finite presentation involved but only on the isomorphism class of @xmath1 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 has a _",
    "solvable _ word problem ( resp .",
    "conjugacy problem ) if @xmath1 admits a solution to the word problem ( resp .",
    "conjugacy problem ) .",
    "+ by a 3-manifold we mean a connected compact manifold of dimension 3 with boundary ; a 3-manifold may be orientable or not .",
    "we work in the pl category ; according to the hauptvermutung and moise s theorem this is not restrictive .",
    "following the work of thurston ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) an oriented 3-manifold @xmath6 is _ geometrizable _ if the pieces obtained in its canonical topological decomposition ( roughly speaking along essential spheres , discs and tori ) have interiors which admit complete locally homogeneous riemanian metrics .",
    "it s an important result that every orientable 3-manifold is geometrizable ; the work of perelman following hamilton program in the early 2000 s , awarded by a fields medal in 2006 , together with clarifications by numerous authors ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) gives a proof of this statement .",
    "we make implicit the assumption that all non - orientable 3-manifolds considered have an orientation cover with total space a geometrizable orientable 3-manifold , by talking of geometrizable non - orientable 3-manifolds ( this is a weak version of geometrization conjecture for non - orientable 3-manifolds , see @xcite p.484485 ) .",
    "the reader who might not feel comfortable with perelman s proof may consider this assumption as a rectrictive hypothesis on the non - orientable 3-manifolds to which our method applies .    in the class of fundamental groups of geometrizable 3-manifolds ,",
    "the word problem is known to be solvable , following early work of waldhausen ( @xcite ) as well as later work of epstein and thurston on automatic group theory ( cf .",
    "we have proved in @xcite that groups of orientable geometrizable 3-manifolds have a solvable conjugacy problem ; we will make use of those two results in our proof .",
    "we now focus on non - orientable 3-manifolds and construct an algorithm solving the conjugacy problem in their fundamental groups . in conclusion all 3-manifolds have fundamental groups with solvable conjugacy problem , which contrasts with higher dimensions .",
    "we also state as corollaries that the conjugacy problem is solvable in surface - by - cyclic groups and that the twisted conjugacy problem is solvable in surface groups ( cf .",
    "the solution to the conjugacy problem in groups of non - orientable 3-manifolds does not follow as a direct consequence of the existence of a solution in the oriented case , since d.collins and c.miller have shown that the conjugacy problem can be unsolvable in a group even when solvable in an index 2 subgroup ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless our strategy will consist essentially in reducing to the conjugacy problem in the oriented case .",
    "we briefly emphasize two points which sound noteworthy to us . on the one hand",
    "the core of the algorithm makes use of basic solutions to the word and conjugacy problem in groups of orientable 3-manifolds , themselves reducing to basic solutions , built from biautomatic group theory , in groups of the basic pieces , seifert fiber spaces and finite volume hyperbolic manifolds , and requires no naive enumerating algorithm .",
    "so one may expect to construct an efficient algorithm , provided that efficient process solving dehn problems in groups of the basic pieces were known . on the other hand our general strategy to reduce the problem to similar problems in the orientation cover may help solving the conjugacy problem of a group @xmath1 containing an index 2 subgroup @xmath7 with solvable conjugacy problem .",
    "one of our key ingredients here is that centralizers in @xmath1 of non trivial elements of @xmath7 are fair enough : they can be computed and have solvable dehn problems . the general translation which would ensure a solution in an abstract group @xmath1 containing an index 2 subgroup",
    "@xmath7 would become that ( i ) one can decide whether two arbitrary elements of order 2 are conjugate in @xmath1 , and ( ii ) for any @xmath8 , of order @xmath9 , @xmath10 can be computed and has a solvable conjugacy problem .",
    "this work is mainly devoted to prove the following result : + * theorem a.  [ main result . ] * + together with a solution in the oriented case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , one obtains : + * theorem b. * note that theorem a does not follow as an easy consequence of the oriented case ; indeed the usual technique which consists in translating the problem to the oriented cover fails to give an immediate answer , for the conjugacy problem can be unsolvable in a group @xmath1 even when solvable in an index 2 subgroup @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note also that we do not only show existence of a solution , but rather give a constructive process to build an algorithm solving the problem .",
    "moreover whenever @xmath11 are conjugate the algorithm implicitely produces a conjugating element @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "+ theorem b has several consequences .",
    "concerning decision problems relative to boundary subgroups in groups of geometrizable 3-manifolds one obtains : + * theorem c. *    _ proof that theorem b @xmath14 theorem c. _ double the 3-manifold @xmath6 along the identity on @xmath15 to obtain @xmath16 .",
    "the proof of lemma 1.2 of @xcite , as well as the observation that the orientation cover of @xmath16 is the double of the orientation cover of @xmath6 along the lift(s ) of @xmath15 show that @xmath16 is geometrizable .",
    "its group splits into an amalgam of two copies of @xmath17 along the identity of @xmath18 , say @xmath19 . given @xmath20 lying in the @xmath1 left factor",
    "we denote @xmath21 the corresponding element of the @xmath1 right factor .",
    "since the gluing map is the identity @xmath22 , one obtains by applying elementary facts on amalgams ( cf .",

    "it has been proved in @xcite that ( f.g .",
    "free)-by - cyclic groups have solvable conjugacy problem . as a complementary result we can deduce from theorem b together with the dehn - nielsen theorem the same statement concerning ( closed surface)-by - cyclic groups , so that any ( compact surface)-by - cyclic group turns out to have a solvable conjugacy problem .    *",
    "theorem d. *    _ proof that theorem b @xmath14 theorem d. _ let @xmath15 be a closed surface , @xmath29 , and @xmath1 be an extension of @xmath30 by a cyclic group @xmath31 . in case",
    "@xmath31 is finite , @xmath1 is biautomatic and has solvable conjugacy problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in case @xmath31 is infinite , the extension splits as @xmath32 for some @xmath33 .",
    "the dehn - nielsen theorem ( theorem 3.4.6 , @xcite ) shows that @xmath34 is induced by an homeomorphism @xmath35 of the surface @xmath15 so that @xmath1 is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the bundle over @xmath36 with fiber @xmath15 and sewing map @xmath35 .",
    "it follows from the thurston geometrization theorem ( @xcite ) that such a bundle is geometrizable so that theorem b shows that @xmath1 has solvable conjugacy problem.@xmath28 + a third consequence concerns the twisted conjugacy problem in surface groups . given a group @xmath1 and an automorphism @xmath34 of @xmath1 the twisted conjugacy problem is solvable in @xmath37 if one can algorithmically decide given any couple @xmath38 whether there exists @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "the twisted conjugacy problem is solvable in @xmath1 if it is solvable in @xmath37 for any automorphism @xmath41 .",
    "* theorem e. * + together with the case of f.g .",
    "free groups ( cf .",

    "existence of such @xmath25 is equivalent to @xmath44 conjugate to @xmath45 in @xmath1 . for",

    "the process is done in four steps . in the first step we reduce to the closed irreducible case , _",
    "i.e. _ we prove that from solutions in groups of closed irreducible non - orientable 3-manifolds one recovers solutions in groups of all non - orientable 3-manifolds . in the second step",

    "lemma 1.1 of @xcite asserts that the inclusion map of @xmath6 in @xmath66 induces an embedding of @xmath64 in @xmath67 , and that @xmath68 are conjugate in @xmath64 if and only if they are conjugate in @xmath67 ; hence the conjugacy problem in @xmath64 reduces to the conjugacy problem in @xmath67 .",
