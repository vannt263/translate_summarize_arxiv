    "phase transitions are key milestones in the thermal history of the universe . as the universe evolves and cools , fundamental symmetries are spontaneously broken and cosmological phase transitions occur",
    ". therefore , the observation of phase - transition remnants can give us direct access to high energy particle physics and the very early universe .",
    "superconducting cosmic strings are one of a variety of topological defects that could be produced at phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "as superconducting strings move through the cosmic magnetized plasma , they can develop and carry large currents , and oscillating loops of superconducting strings will emit copious amounts of electromagnetic radiation and particles mostly as bursts @xcite .",
    "this led to the idea that superconducting strings may be a candidate for the engine driving observed gamma ray bursts @xcite , sources of cosmic ray bursts @xcite and radio transients @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the role of superconducting cosmic strings as sources that inject energy in the cosmic medium and cause spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the measurement of the cmb spectral distortion is a good probe of the thermal history of the universe and has been studied analytically and numerically in refs .  .",
    "in the early universe ( @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cosmic redshift ) , double compton and compton scatterings are very efficient , and any energy that is injected in photons into the cosmic medium is thermalized , and the cosmic radiation spectrum remains that of a blackbody .",
    "however , the expansion of the universe makes these scatterings less efficient with time and energy injected at epochs with @xmath8 produces cmb spectral distortions .",
    "that is , the spectrum departs from a blackbody spectrum .",
    "such distortions are commonly described by two parameters : the @xmath0 ( chemical potential ) distortion parameter , and the compton @xmath1-parameter .",
    "current constraints on these parameters have been obtained by cobe firas and are : @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed future space mission called pixie has the potential to give dramatically tighter constraints on both types of distortion , @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the 5 @xmath13 level @xcite .",
    "there are several more conventional reasons for expecting cmb distortions .",
    "the diffusion of density fluctuations before recombination , known as silk damping @xcite , is an energy injection source which produces cmb distortions @xcite at the level of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "other energy injection sources include massive unstable relic particles which decay during the thermalization epoch @xcite , dissipation of primordial magnetic fields during the recombination epoch @xcite , and hawking radiation from primordial black holes @xcite .",
    "an observation of cmb distortions will not by itself definitively point to a particular injection source , though upper limits on the distortions can be used to place constraints on models .",
    "we evaluate both @xmath0- and @xmath1-distortions due to energy injected from superconducting string loops .",
    "the injected energy depends on the current , @xmath3 , carried by the strings , and on the string tension , @xmath2 .",
    "in general , the current arises due to the interaction of strings with ambient magnetic fields and need not be constant along a string , and may also vary among different parts of the string network .",
    "however , we shall simplify our analysis by assuming the same constant current along all strings in the network .",
    "this simplification is expected to be accurate in the presence of primordial magnetic fields so that there is sufficient time for the current to build up and saturate at its maximum possible value .    in this paper , we will obtain constraints in the two dimensional parameter space given by the electric current on superconducting cosmic string loops and the string tension ( @xmath15 plane ) due to present limits on cmb distortions .",
    "early analyses placed a constraint on the fraction of electromagnetic to gravitational radiation from strings @xcite .",
    "however , since both the electromagnetic and gravitational power depend on the string tension , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : network ] , those results can not be directly used to produce a constraint plot in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "our analysis also differs from earlier work in details of the string network , and we are able to forecast constraints from future observation missions such as pixie .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : network ] , we discuss the cosmic string network properties and number density of loops , and then , derive the rate of electromagnetic energy density emitted from cusps of superconducting cosmic string loops . in sec .  [",
    "sec : cmbdist ] , we calculate the spectral distortions of the cmb parametrized by chemical potential @xmath0 and compton @xmath1-parameter due to cosmic strings , and obtain the corresponding constraints from cobe and pixie . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our findings .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use parameters for a flat @xmath16cdm model : @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "note also that @xmath21 in the radiation dominant epoch and @xmath22 in the matter dominant epoch , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "we also adopt natural units , @xmath26 , and set the boltzman constant to unity , @xmath27 .",
    "a superconducting string loop emits electromagnetic radiation at frequency harmonics defined by its inverse length .",
    "the emitted power is dominated by the highest frequency and is cut off by the finite thickness of the string .",
    "the total power emitted in photons from loops with cusps is @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath3 is the current on the string ( assumed constant ) , @xmath2 is the string tension , and @xmath29 is a numerical coefficient that depends on the shape of the loop .",
    "the string network also contains a similar number of loops without cusps which emit much less power , @xmath30 , in electromagnetic radiation than loops with cusps .",
    "therefore , the contribution of cuspless loops can be ignored .",
    "the loop also emits gravitational radiation with power @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath2 , there is a critical current @xmath33 and for @xmath34 electromagnetic radiation dominates and determines the lifetime of the loop , while for @xmath35 gravitational losses are more important .",
    "hence , we can write the lifetime of a string loop of length @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 if a loop is born with length @xmath39 , its length changes with time as @xmath40 assuming slow decay , we take @xmath41 and hence @xmath42    analytical studies @xcite and simulations @xcite all yield a consistent picture for large cosmic string loops but differing results for small loops .",
    "the results can be summarized during the cosmological radiation dominated epoch ( @xmath43 ) , by giving the number density of loops of length between @xmath39 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 the overall normalization factor , @xmath46 , will be assumed to be @xmath47 . in our calculation",
    ", we shall take the exponent @xmath48 , though somewhat different values are suggested in other studies , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xcite .",
    "our final constraints are not affected significantly by such a slight increase in the value of @xmath51 , especially because the increased effect from small loops is compensated by the smaller value of @xmath46 .",

    "similarly , during the cosmological matter dominated epoch the number density of loops is @xmath54 where @xmath55 the second term takes into account the loops from the radiation dominated epoch that survive into the matter dominated epoch .",
    "the energy injection rate into photons from cosmic strings is found by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : pgamma ] ) by the number density of loops in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndensity ] ) , and integrating over loop length @xmath56    .",

    "in the early universe ( @xmath63 where @xmath7 denotes cosmic redshift ) , we expect that energy injected into the cosmological medium will be thermalized by photon - electron interactions , i.e. , by compton and double compton scatterings . as a result",
    ", the photon distribution in the early universe maintains its blackbody spectrum .",
    "however , the energy injection from cosmic strings mainly consists of very high energy photons ( @xmath64 ) and the optical depth of such high energy photons for compton and double compton scatterings is not high , because the scattering cross - sections are suppressed by the photon energy .",
    "then , thermalization proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , the high energy photons lose their energy quickly via photon - photon scattering or photo pair production ( see ref .",
    "once the energy of the photons is reduced by these processes , they can be thermalized by compton and double compton scatterings and the photons again achieve a blackbody spectrum .    at lower redshifts ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "compton and double compton scatterings decouple and the injected photons can no longer be thermalized efficiently .",
    "accordingly , energy injection produces distortions in the blackbody spectrum of the cmb .",
    "first , the decoupling of double compton scattering takes place at @xmath66 . as a consequence",
    ", photon number is conserved for @xmath65 , and only the energy among the photons can be re - distributed .",
    "this is insufficient to establish a blackbody spectrum for the photons .",
    "however , the injected photons are still thermalized by compton scattering , and the cmb spectrum in this thermal equilibrium state is described by the bose - einstein distribution with a chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "thermalization due to compton scattering also becomes inefficient at @xmath67 , when the time scale of the compton scattering process becomes longer than the hubble time .",
    "the energy injection after compton decoupling produces a distortion which is parameterized by the compton @xmath1-parameter .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath0-distortion of the cmb spectrum due to energy injection is given by @xcite @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the photon energy density , @xmath70 is the time scale for double compton scattering @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the primordial helium mass fraction .",
