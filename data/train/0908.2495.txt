    "living at the intersection of spirals and ellipticals on the hubble tuning fork , lenticular ( or s0 ) galaxies are often thought to be remnants of spirals after star formation ( sf ) has ceased ( or has slowed down substantially ) .",
    "this transition in the sf rate ( sfr ) must be directly related to the change of cold gas content and/or density in the disk of such a galaxy .",
    "the change may be caused by such processes as ( e.g. , martig et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) : ram - pressure stripping ( of cold gas ) , termination or strangulation ( removing surrounding hot gas , hence a source of new cold gas ) , morphological quenching ( heating of a stellar disk or even transforming to a spheroid ) , and exhaustion ( consuming gas via sf ) .",
    "while the ram - pressure stripping of the cold or hot gas is expected to work primarily in a dense environment ( in galaxy clusters and possibly in rich groups ) , the morphological quenching via galaxy - galaxy mergers should be most effective in groups .",
    "the exhaustion , an internal process , can occur in both rich and poor environments .",
    "for example , this process may occur for a relatively isolated galaxy when its halo mass @xmath9 grows to be @xmath10 and its gas accretion mode turns from cold to hot ( e.g. , kere et al . 2005 ; kere & hernquist 2009 and references therein ) . in general , more than one of these processes may be involved in the transition of a galaxy .",
    "their relative importance can not be determined easily ; great uncertainty remains in our understanding of the processes , especially in terms of their interplay with various other galactic activities such as the feedback from stars and agns . while observational studies of galaxy transformation have been concentrated on stellar properties , theoretical efforts ( or computational simulations )",
    "are primarily on gaseous components on galaxy scales .",
    "this gap must be bridged to make significant progress in the field .    here",
    "we present a case study of the nearby edge - on s0 galaxy ngc  5866 ( also referred as m  102 or `` spindle '' galaxy ; see table  [ table : basicpara ] for the salient parameters ) .",
    "our goal is to understand the potential role of the stellar energy and mass feedback in regulating the evolution of various gaseous components in this relatively isolated galaxy .",
    "ngc  5866 belongs to the poor group lgg  396 with a velocity dispersion of @xmath11 ( e.g. , mulchaey et al .",
    "two gas - rich companions , ngc  5907 ( sc ) and ngc  5879 ( sbc ) , are known to be located several hundred kpc away ; their interactions with ngc  5866 should be minimal .",
    "so we can focus on internal activities of the galaxy .",
    "as will be discussed later , this isolated environment in the `` field '' may explain the relatively richness of molecular gas in the galaxy ( table [ table : basicpara ] ; welch & sage 2003 ; sage & welch 2006 ) and its slow evolution with ongoing low - level sf many gigayears after a major merger .",
    "there is also no evidence for strong nuclear activity in the galaxy ( terashima & wilson 2003 ) ; the nucleus is classified in optical to be an intermediate object between a weak region and a liner ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , we can examine the effect of the stellar feedback with little confusion from other potential sources of mechanical energy inputs .",
    "furthermore , the nearly complete edge - on inclination of the galaxy is optimal for the study of the galactic disk / halo interaction . indeed ,",
    "archival _ hst _ optical images ( first studied by cantiello , blakeslee & raimondo 2007 for globular clusters ) show numerous off - disk cold gas spurs , in addition to a well - defined dust lane . to our knowledge",
    ", no characterization of such spurs has ever been made for any s0 galaxies , let alone their nature and role in the galactic gaseous evolution .",
    "a previous x - ray study based on _ rosat _ observation revealed that ngc  5866 is an x - ray faint galaxy and that the x - ray emission is dominated by stellar sources ( pellegrini 1994 ) .",
    "there was also a study based on a snap - shot ( 2  ks ) observation made with _",
    "chandra _ to see if an agn is present in the galaxy ( terashima & wilson 2003 ) ; only an upper limit of @xmath12 was obtained , assuming the distance of the galaxy to be @xmath13 ( pellegrini 2005 ) .",
    "our study is based on a later 34  ks _ chandra _ observation ( previously studied by david et al .",
    "2006 in a sample of early - type galaxies ) , which allows us to resolve out much of the discrete source contribution and to examine the potentially diffuse x - ray emission from the galaxy . in short , with various available tracers ( optical absorption as well as h@xmath3/p@xmath3 , infrared ( ir ) and soft x - ray emissions )",
    ", we can now characterize the cold molecular / atomic , warm ionized , dusty and hot phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and explore their relationships with the stellar feedback in the galaxy .",

    "the low level of sf inferred here is consistent with the constraint ( @xmath101 ) obtained from the model fit to the observed sed of ngc  5866 over the @xmath102 range ( draine et al .",
    "this means the sfr estimated using the mid - ir emission is reliable within the errors for ngc  5866 , and further indicates that the mips 24  @xmath95 luminosity is mainly produced by the weak sf process in the disk .",
    "the ongoing sf also explains the ionizing photon flux needed for producing the p@xmath3 luminosity .",

    "this may be a lower limit , since we may have still missed part of the p@xmath3 emission from the disk , due to its strong extinction .",
    "alternatively , could the ionizing radiation be supplied by evolved stars ? we use the ionizing radiation with a rate of @xmath106 for post - agb stars ( binette et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath107 for hot horizontal branch stars ( han et al .",
    "2007 ) . adopting the total stellar mass of the galaxy , @xmath108 as inferred in ",
    "[ sec : coolgas ] , we estimate that the total expected hydrogen recombination rate for the galaxy is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the fraction of the evolved ionizing photons intercepted by the gas .",
    "while most of the stars are in the galactic bulge , @xmath110 should be considerably smaller than one .",

    "@xmath112 appear to be considerably stronger than what are expected from ionizing photons purely from the evolved stars ( malhotra et al .",

    "the estimation of these parameters are all based on the most reliable spectral fit parameters , i.e. , the temperature , the luminosity and the emission measure of the thermal component (  [ sec : hotgas ] ) .",
    "the most natural source of the gas that is subsequently heated is the mass loss of evolved stars .",
    "assuming the mass loss by each planetary nebula ( pn ) is @xmath121 ( faber & gallagher 1976 ) , and using the pn birth rate in our galaxy @xmath122 ( peimbert 1993 ) , the mass loss rate ( @xmath123 ) is @xmath124 . adopting the stellar mass estimated in ",
    "[ subsec : sf ] and the age of @xmath92 (  [ subsec : sf ] ) , the total mass return in ngc  5866 is then @xmath125 , which is substantially greater than what is observed in the hot gas .",
    "furthermore , the mass - averaged fe abundance as estimated from the mass loss of the evolved stars and metal enrichment of the type ia sn ejecta is about 6 times the solar value ( grevesse & suval 1998 ) , much larger than our spectral fit result (  [ sec : hotgas ] ) .",
    "one possibility of this relatively low observed fe abundance is that the bulk of the fe - rich sn ejecta is being blown out of the bulge before being fully mixed with the materials from the stellar mass loss ( tang et al .",
    "2009 ) .    to see",
    "if the heating provided by type  ia sne is sufficient to explain the x - ray cooling luminosity , we compare the x - ray luminosity with the sn heating rate . the supersolar iron abundance , as inferred from the spectral analysis of the hot gas , is consistent with heating primarily by type  ia sne .",
    "assuming that each sn releases @xmath126 and using the empirical type  ia sn rate of mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which can be approximately expressed as @xmath127 , and the stellar mass @xmath128 (  [ subsec : sf ] ) , we estimate the total type  ia sn rate of @xmath129 and the mechanical energy injection rate as @xmath130 .",
    "this energy injection rate is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the x - ray luminosity !",
    "while a fraction of the energy injected into the cool gas disk may be radiated in other energy bands ( e.g. , extreme- and far - uv ) , avoiding a detection so far , the general lack of cool gas in the galactic bulge makes it hard to hide and convert the mechanical energy .",
    "therefore , there is a missing stellar feedback problem in ngc  5866 , similar to situations in other low - to - intermediate mass early - type galaxies ( e.g. li , wang & hameed 2007 ; li , & wang 2008 ; david et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this missing stellar feedback indicates the presence of an outflow from the galactic bulge .",
    "the dynamics of this outflow depends critically on the mass - loading from the cool gas disk , which is indicated by the observed low temperature of the hot gas in .",
    "the specific enthalpy of the stellar feedback , @xmath131 per particle , would give an average gas temperature of @xmath132 at the bulge center , which is substantially greater than @xmath133 inferred from the x - ray spectrum of the bulge (  [ sec : hotgas ] ) .",
    "in the inner bulge , the kinetic energy is often negligible compared to the thermal energy of the hot gas ( tang et al .",
    "2009 ) , so it can not account for this large temperature difference .",
    "part of the difference can be attributed to the sn energy stored in other forms ( possibly magnetic field and cosmic rays as well as turbulent motion ) , the equal - partition among which may account for a factor up to 3 - 4 .",
    "the emission measure - weighted temperature , as in the x - ray spectral analysis , also tends to under - estimate the real gas temperature by a factor @xmath134 ( tang et al .",
    "at least an additional factor of 2 - 3 is needed to explain our measured low temperature .",
    "this factor can be naturally explained by the mass - loading from the cool gas disk , as evidenced by the presence of extraplanar warm - ionized gas and dusty spurs , which represent the interface between the hot gas in the bulge and the cool gas in the disk .",
    "assuming a temperature of @xmath135 and an approximate pressure balance with the hot gas , we estimate the parameters of the warm ionized gas based on the observed p@xmath3 emission measure . the volume filling factor , number density and total mass of the warm gas estimated this way",
    "are @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the total mass is roughly consistent with the value of @xmath7 as listed in table  [ table : basicpara ] .",
    "however , the number density is too high compared to that in other nearby galaxies ( e.g. collins et al . 2000 ) , indicating that the warm and hot gas may be not in a pressure balance state , or the warm ionized gas may present as skins of some unresolved cool gas filaments .",
    "similar dusty spurs and their correlation with the extraplanar ionized gas have been observed previously in nearby edge - on _ active star - forming _ galaxies ( e.g. , howk & savage 1999 ; li et al .",
    "2008 ; rossa et al .",
    "in particular , howk & savage ( 1997 ) have presented several mechanisms for the formation of extraplanar dusty features observed in ngc  891 .",
    "these mechanisms include hydrodynamical processes like galactic fountain , radiation pressure driven outflow , and magnetic instability presumably induced by the differential rotation of galactic gaseous disks .",
    "the galactic fountain , the radiation pressure , and some magnetic instabilities like the parker instability are closely related to recent star forming activities .",
    "this is consistent with an apparent correlation between the amount of extraplanar gas and the sf rate of galaxies ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "the heights and masses of the extraplanar cold gas features in ngc  5866 are significantly smaller than that in late - type galaxies ( howk & savage 1999 ) .",
    "thus the processes responsible for producing the features are probably less energetic and would be overwhelmed in an active star forming galaxy .",
    "the very detection of the extraplanar extinction features in ngc  5866 is largely due to its nearly perfect edge - on perspective and its prominent stellar bulge background light .",
    "to check out the mechanical energy requirement for the extraplanar extinction features , we estimate their gravitational potential energies .",
    "following howk & savage ( 1997 ) , we estimate the energy @xmath139 of a feature at height @xmath53 from the mid - plane as : @xmath140\\rm~ergs\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the mass of the cold gas feature , @xmath142 is the scale height of the mass density and is taken to be @xmath143 ( @xmath38 ) , and @xmath144 is the mass density at the mid - plane derived from the mass of the stellar disk (  [ subsec : sf ] ) and its size .",
    "the estimated gravitational potential energies for individual spurs are included in table  [ table : dustfeature ] .",
    "the mechanical energy needed to overcome the gravitational potential energy for an individual spur is mostly comparable to that expected for a single sn .",
    "some of the spurs may represent super - impositions of multiple features .",
    "in such cases , the required energy could be considerably less .",
    "so in principle such spurs can be produced by individual sne ( e.g. , raley , shelton & plewa 2007 ) , although some may be due to concerted energy inputs from massive stars , which may be formed in small groups or associations in . using the empirical sfr - dependent relationship of cappellaro , evans & turatto  ( 1999 ) , we estimate the core collapsed sn rate as @xmath145 , which is smaller than the type  ia sn rate of @xmath129 as estimated in  [ sec : ism ] .",
    "thus in ngc  5866 , type  ia sne may be the primary energy source of the extraplanar dusty spurs , although core collapsed sne can also be important .",
    "in contrast , the required energy for a high-@xmath53 cold gas feature in late - type galaxies typically equals tens or hundreds of the sn energy ( howk & savage 1997 , 1999 ; thompson , howk & savage 2004 ) .",
    "this large energy requirement means most of the high-@xmath53 cold gas features in these galaxies should be produced by the concerted energy injection from massive star forming regions .",
    "similarly , large scale cold gas filaments ( e.g. , feature  `` 16 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : dustfeature ] ) detected in ngc  5866 also require substantially more energy to form .",
    "they are probably produced by mechanical energy inputs provided collectively by core collapsed sne in the disk and/or type  ia sne in the bulge of the galaxy .",
    "we further estimate the disk mass loss rate via outflows as indicated by the extraplanar dusty spurs in . from the simulation of extraplanar sne driven disk outflow ( raley , shelton & plewa 2007 ) , the typical timescale to form an extraplanar cold gas spur through sne driven hydrodynamical processes is @xmath146 . from the mass of the observed extraplanar cool gas ( @xmath147 ;  [ sec : coolgas ] )",
    ", we infer the disk mass loss rate as @xmath148 . a mass - loading to the hot phase at a comparable rate",
    "can naturally explain the low temperature of the hot gas (  [ sec : ism ] ) .",
    "but , assume a constant mass - loss rate of @xmath148 , the disk would have lost @xmath149 over 8  gyr , which is an order of magnitude more than what remains in the disk . the current mass loss from the disk",
    "is driven by individual sne (  [ sec : coolgasenergetics ] ) , a scenario different from that assumed for more energetic features detected in more active star forming galaxies . however , during the evolution of the galaxy , different processes ( e.g. type  ia sne and sf ) may dominate in different stages , so the mass loss rate may not be constant .",
    "in addition , accretion of cold gas from the intergalactic space could to some degree replenish the mass loss from the cold gas disk , which will also affect the observed amount of cold gas in the disk .    some of the outflowing hot gas will eventually cool and return to the disk .",
    "indeed , the mass - loaded hot gas with a temperature of @xmath150  kev is not expected to escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the corresponding sound speed of the hot gas is only about @xmath151 , which is considerably smaller than the escape velocity , which should roughly be about three times of the circular velocity ( @xmath152 ; neistein et al .",
    "1999 ) for a typical dark halo potential . in this case",
    ", the hot gas will be confined by the gravitational potential of the galactic halo .",
    "the outflow is likely to be subsonic , explaining the moderate x - ray luminosity of the hot gas emission from  ( tang et al .",
    "the upper limit to the outflow speed , @xmath153 , may be estimated from the accumulation time scale ( @xmath154  yrs ) of the hot gas in the bulge via the mass loss of evolved stars and from the cool gas mass loading from the disk .",
    "the lower limit can be set to have the cooling time scale ( @xmath155  yrs ) of the hot gas longer than its escape time scale , assuming a characteristic bulge x - ray emission radius to be @xmath156 kpc .",
    "we thus have @xmath157 .",
    "the gas will cool in the large - scale galactic halo and will eventually return to the disk / bulge of the galaxy , which may be partly responsible for the present dusty galactic disk .",
    "therefore , we expect a gas circulation , or a halo fountain ( i.e. , an outflow of heated gas to the halo and an inflow of cool gas to the disk / bulge ) , some of the extraplanar dusty structures may be such cool gas inflow ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dustfeature ] ) .",
    "now let us see how  may fit into the existing picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "s0 galaxies in general are believed to be evolved from spirals when they have exhausted gas for massive sf .",
    "much of the existing work has been focused on s0 galaxies in cluster environments , where the exhaustion of the gas is typically attributed to the ram - pressure stripping by the ambient medium ( e.g. van  dokkum et al . 1998 ; bekki , couch & shioya 2002 ; goto et al .",
    "2003 ; moran et al .",
    "outside clusters , the ram - pressure is unlikely to be strong enough to remove cool gas from galactic disks , although it may still be important in stripping gas from extended galactic halos and/or regulating the accretion from the intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , kawata & mulchaey 2008 ) .",
    "the evolution of such a field galaxy at present is typically dominated by internal processes , with galactic mass as the key parameter , according to recent simulations of galaxy formation ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; birnboim et al .",
    "2007 ; kere et al . 2005 , 2009 ) .",
    "a galaxy with @xmath158 is expected to obtain its gas primarily in a so - called hot mode , in which accreted gas gets shock - heated near the virial radius to @xmath159  k. this virial shock presumably does not develop in lower mass galaxies , and the accretion is in a cold mode , in which the gas flows along narrow filaments that extend well inside the virial radius .",
    "this simple picture may provide a natural interpretation for the observed galaxy bi - modality of stellar color and morphology , although complications arise when galaxy - galaxy mergers and galactic feedback are considered . in this evolution picture , s0 galaxies may be a direct result of their mass growth , passing through the mass threshold , through mergers and/or accretion .",
    "however , a field s0 galaxy formed this way ( shutting off the cool gas supply ) is expected to contain certain amount of cool gas in the galactic disk .",
    "in addition to the accumulation of the stellar mass loss , as discussed earlier , we also expect residual gas in the galactic disk from past sf .",
    "the consumption via sf becomes inefficient as the amount of cool gas slowly decreases ( e.g. , considering the schmidt - kennicutt law and the toomre column density criterion of sf ; kennicutt  1998 ; toomre  1964 ) .",
    "so substantial amounts of the disk gas should remain when the sf has more or less ceased , which may be the case for ngc  5866 and other field s0 galaxies ( e.g. , sage & welch 2006 ) .",
    "of course , as demonstrated in the present work , the feedback from old stars in the galactic disk and bulge , though relatively gentle , is long lasting , which can help to evaporate the cool gas disk .",
    "the effectiveness of this process on the long run depends on whether or not the evaporated gas can cool and then fall back into the disk , which is in turn sensitive to the intergalactic ram - pressure that the gaseous halo is subject to .",
    "ngc  5866 is relatively rich in cool gas as an s0 galaxy ( welch & sage 2003 ; sage & welch 2006 ) , which may be due to a lower than average ram - pressure  a result of the galaxy s relative isolation in a low - density environment . how the environment and s0 galaxy evolution affect the gas content and other galactic properties will be discussed in a following paper",
    "we have presented a multi - wavelength study of the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc  5866 in a very low density environment .",
    "we characterize various stellar and gaseous components and discuss the galactic disk / halo interaction and its role in the evolution of s0 galaxies .",
    "the main results are as follows :    * based on a  acis observation , we detect 15 point - like sources within the galactic bulge of the galaxy .",
    "one of them , with a 1.5 - 7  kev luminosity of @xmath160 , probably represents a very weak agn of the galaxy . * after removing the detected sources and subtracting remaining stellar contributions , we reveal the x - ray emission from the diffuse hot gas in and around the galactic bulge .",
    "the emission extends as far as 3.5 kpc away from the galactic plane and has a total luminosity of @xmath161 in 0.5 - 2 kev . with a characteristic temperature of @xmath162 and a total mass of @xmath120 , the hot gas most likely represents a combination of the expected stellar mass loss and the mass - loading from the cool gas disk of the galaxy .",
    "the hot gas is over - abundant in iron and under - abundant in oxygen , indicating a strong chemical enrichment by type  ia sne .",
    "* we detect warm ionized gas based on  observations of h@xmath3/p@xmath3 emission .",
    "this gas has an exponential scale height of @xmath0 and extends as far as @xmath163 from the mid - plane , indicating the presence of an extraplanar component .",
    "massive stars in the galactic disk are primarily responsible for the ionization of this warm ionized gas .",
    "* we characterize numerous cold gas features off the galactic disk , based on their extinction against the bulge stellar light .",
    "dusty spurs typically have extensions similar to the warm ionized gas and have individual masses of @xmath164 .",
    "such spurs may be generated mostly by individual sne in the galactic disk .",
    "but there are also more energetic kpc - scale filaments , which may be produced by sne collectively in the disk and/or bulge of the galaxy . *",
    "we show strong evidence for ongoing massive sf in the disk of the galaxy at a rate of @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of the massive stars is required for the heating of the dust and warm ionized gas .",
    "the stars , which tend to be formed in groups , may be responsible for some of the energetic extraplanar cool gas features . * the relative richness of cool gas in the galactic disk",
    "is probably related to the isolation of the galaxy in a low density environment .",
    "this gas , while being slowly consumed by the sf , may be replenished by the mass loss of evolved star , mostly in the galactic bulge .",
    "the gas appears to be undergoing a circulation between the cool and hot phases via the galactic disk / halo interaction .",
    "this circulation becomes possible for the galaxy because of both the low temperature of the mass - loaded hot gas and the inefficiency of ram - pressure stripping in the environment . * a field s0 galaxy may form mainly from the development of a hot gaseous halo , which stops or slows down the supply of cool gas from the igm .",
    "this development may be a natural consequence of the mass growth of a galaxy , according to recent structure formation simulations .",
    "but the inclusion of the galactic feedback as well as the environmental effects , as indicated in the present work , may also be important .",
