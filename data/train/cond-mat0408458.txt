    "thus knowledge of the structure and stability of gold nanocrystals is of great importance .",
    "while bulk gold has an fcc crystal structure , the competition between bulk and surface energies in nanometer sized gold crystallites can result in several different competing structures @xcite .",
    "one such structure which has been observed both in simulations @xcite and in experiments @xcite is the `` mackay icosahedron''@xcite , which we will also denote as the `` ih structure '' , consisting of @xmath2 slightly distorted fcc tetrahedra , with four @xmath3 facets each , meeting at the center to form an icosahedral shaped cluster .",
    "the internal facets of the tetrahedra meet at strain inducing twin grain boundaries with a local hcp structure , leaving the cluster with @xmath2 external @xmath3 facets . for an ih structure with @xmath4 shells ,",
    "the magic number of atoms needed to construct a perfectly symmetric ideal icosahedron is @xcite , @xmath5 in fig.[fig:2869 ] we show the atomic configuration for an ideal ih structure with the magic number of @xmath6 atoms ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "similar stability limits for icosahedral gold clusters were predicted by marks using a modified wulff construction @xcite .",
    "more recent atomistic calculations@xcite find that , at @xmath9 , icosahedral gold nanoclusters are the lowest energy structure only in a very small size range of tens of atoms ; other structures , such as an fcc crystal with a truncated octahedral shape , become energetically favored at larger sizes .",

    "simulations by cleveland _",
    "_ @xcite found that when fcc truncated - octahedral gold clusters with hundreds of atoms were heated , they underwent a transformation to the icosahedral structure .    while the theoretical limit of stability of ih structures thus remains unclear , and their formation may involve kinetic rather than strictly equilibrium effects @xcite , it is natural to suppose that the formation of the ih structure is related to the very high stability of the @xmath3 external surfaces .",
    "simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite on bulk slab - like geometries with exposed @xmath3 surfaces have shown that , unlike the @xmath11 and @xmath12 surfaces which melt below the bulk melting temperature @xmath13 , the @xmath3 surface is a nonmelting surface without roughening , wetting , or melting up to the bulk melting temperature @xmath13 , and can in fact lead to superheating of the solid @xcite . in light of this observation it is interesting to consider how the high stability of the @xmath3 facets effects the melting and equilibrium shape of such icosahedral clusters .    in this paper , we will show , by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , that liquid gold clusters with about @xmath0@xmath1 atoms crystallize into an ih structure , with a missing central atom , upon cooling from the liquid .",

    "the equilibrium shape progresses from fully faceted , to faceted with rounded edges , to nearly spherical just below @xmath13 . throughout this region ,",
    "the interior atoms of the cluster remain essentially perfectly ordered , until @xmath13 is reached .",

    "newton s equations of motion are integrated using the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite with a time step of @xmath30 fs . because the many - body `` glue '' potential uses a cutoff , a cell index method can be used to reduce the computational time @xcite . in this method",
    ", the simulation box is divided into cubic cells with side lengths larger than the cutoff distance ( @xmath31  for the gold glue model ) .",

    "we will refer to each time step @xmath39 of the velocity verlet algorithm as one basic molecular dynamics ( md ) step .",
    "since each md step is an integration of newton s equation , it necessarily conserves the total energy of the system , and thus simulates a microcanonical ensemble .",
    "to sample instead in the canonical ensemble , we supplement this basic md step according to two different well known methods . the andersen thermostat @xcite is a method that mimics a system coupled to a heat bath with constant temperature . at the end of each md step ,",
    "each particle of the cluster is , with probability @xmath40 , assigned a new velocity sampled randomly from the boltzmann distribution of a given temperature .",
    "the andersen thermostat samples both configuration and momentum spaces according to the canonical distribution , so that the instantaneous total kinetic energy fluctuates , as is the case for a real physical system .",
    "however , the andersen thermostat method does not conserve the total linear and angular momenta , and so will cause the system s overall position and orientation to drift over the course of the simulation .",
    "this would complicate our analysis of cluster shape as well as atomic diffusion , since we want to measure these quantities with respect to coordinates that stay fixed with respect to the cluster .",
    "this drawback of the andersen thermostat can be avoided using the gaussian isokinetic thermostat @xcite which keeps the total kinetic energy @xmath41 of the system fixed at a value corresponding to a given temperature @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we implement this thermostat by rescaling all velocities by a constant factor after each basic md step so as to conserve the total kinetic energy .",
    "although the gaussian isokinetic dynamics does not sample the canonical distribution in momentum space , this method does correctly sample configuration space and so yields correct equilibrium averages of all structural quantities that depend on positional coordinates only . this  constant temperature \" method has the advantage of conserving both total linear and angular momenta , thus keeping the cluster at a fixed position and orientation .",
    "in our simulations , our first goal will be to cool our cluster to low temperature from a liquid melt to see what solid structure forms .",
    "to do this we use the andersen thermostat method since we believe it models more closely the true dynamics of the physical system , and hence will incorporate effects that may be due to kinetics rather than just pure thermodynamics . later , to observe the equilibrium shape and other properties of the cluster , we will use the constant temperature md to heat back through melting .",
    "this will keep the cluster position and orientation fixed , and so simplify our analysis .      to determine the crystalline structure of our gold nanoclusters",
    ", we will use the method of bond orientational order parameters @xcite , which we now review .",
    "the idea of the bond order parameters is to capture the symmetry of bond orientations regardless of the bond lengths .",
    "a bond is defined as the vector joining a pair of neighboring atoms . throughout our paper",
    ", we will define the neighboring atoms of a given atom @xmath21 as those atoms which have an interatomic distance less than a cutoff radius of @xmath44  , equal to the distance to the minimum between the first and the second peaks of the pair correlation function .",

    "global bond order parameters can then be calculated by averaging @xmath55 over all bonds in the cluster , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of bonds . to make the order parameters invariant with respect to rotations of the reference frame ,",

    "our first step is to determine a tangent plane to the cluster surface at each surface particle .",

    "the schematic of this method is shown in fig.[fig : para ] . to fit the paraboloid at the surface particle @xmath101 , we take the normal vector @xmath81 to the tangent surface at @xmath101 , as computed above , and define this to be the local @xmath102-axis .",
    "we place the origin at @xmath101 and then choose arbitrary but fixed @xmath103 and @xmath104 axes in the tangent plane .",

    "the local curvatures are then given by @xmath116 .",
    "we will see that the maximal local curvature will be very helpful for visualizing the vertex , edge and facet atoms of the cluster surface .",

    "both histograms consist solely of @xmath117 functions , corresponding to the facets , the edges and the vertices of the ih structure . for the bond curvature",
    "histogram there are _ two _ separate peaks for the vertices , corresponding to the bond curvatures between the vertex atoms and the edge atoms , and the vertex atoms and the facet atoms .",

    "both histograms have just one peak of finite width , centered at @xmath118 @xmath119 , with @xmath120  the radius of the spherical liquid drop . note that while the average shape of the liquid drop is close to a perfect sphere , the histogram of its curvatures seems relatively broad .",
    "we have found that this is due to the small discrete number of neighboring surface particles that is used to define the fitted paraboloid .",
    "even small deviations of these particles from a constant radius can lead to noticeable variations in the fitted curvatures .",
    "we find that we can reduce the width of the curvature histogram for the liquid cluster by increasing the cutoff length used to define neighboring particles , and so have more particles included in the fits to the local paraboloids .",
    "however , while this improves the calculation for a spherical cluster , it makes it worse for high curvature regions near edges and vertices in an ih cluster , where curvature varies rapidly as one moves across the surface . with this understanding of our method s limitations ,",
    "we therefore leave our cutoff as given above .",
    "= 8.6truecm      at low temperatures , the atoms in the gold cluster remain at well defined equilibrium positions and only thermally oscillate around the vicinity of these equilibrium positions .",
    "the shape of the cluster is thus easily determined from an instantaneous configuration . at high temperatures ,",
    "however , atoms become more mobile and the macroscopic shape of the cluster fluctuates dramatically from configuration to configuration . in this case",
    "it becomes necessary to average over many fluctuating configurations to define the average cluster shape . since",
    "our constant temperature md conserves total linear and angular momenta and both are set to zero , the configurational shape changes we average over represent fluctuations of the surface atoms rather than trivial shifts or rotations of the cluster as a whole .    at high temperatures ,",
    "simply averaging the position of each atom throughout the course of the simulation does not give the average shape because the atoms are in general no longer bound to specific sites but may diffuse many interatomic spacings through the cluster .",
    "we therefore use the following approach to define the average cluster shape .",
    "we divide the surface of the cluster into equal solid angles , and then average the instantaneous surface atom positions in each solid angle .",
    "this average position in each solid angle then defines the profile of the cluster s average shape .",
    "this average shape does not contain information about the individual surface atom positions , since generally a given solid angle may contain the instantaneous positions of different surface atoms at different times .",
    "to define our solid angle division , we use the best covering spherical codes with icosahedral symmetry @xcite to divide the @xmath121 total solid angle of the sphere centered at the center of mass into cone cells with almost equal solid angles . choosing different numbers of solid angles",
    "results in different resolutions ; we always choose a number of solid angles that matches as close as possible to the number of surface atoms in the cluster .",
    "we illustrate this method for a liquid gold cluster with @xmath37 atoms at @xmath74 k. in figs.[fig : dist](a ) and ( b ) we show two arbitrary instantaneous configurations of the cluster . theoretically , a liquid cluster should have a perfect sphere as the equilibrium shape .",
    "however , we see that the instantaneous configurations can have noticeably large fluctuations about the average shape . applying our shape averaging procedure above on @xmath122 configurations sampled at equal time intervals from @xmath14 ns of simulated time",
    ", we recover that the average shape , shown in fig.[fig : dist](c ) , is a perfect sphere as expected .",
    "note that in figs.[fig : dist](a ) and ( b ) , the small spheres represent instantaneous atomic positions . in contrast , in fig.[fig : dist](c ) , they represent not specific atoms , but rather the average surface position within the given solid angle .",
    "= 8.6truecm      with enough kinetic energy , atoms can hop around their crystal sites and even travel across the whole cluster .",

    "= 8.6truecm    combining all the above we infer the following scenario for diffusion at low temperatures : only atoms on the surface and in the first sub layer show any noticeable diffusion well below @xmath13 .",
    "the atoms in these two layers that diffuse are the same atoms which mix between the two layers ( see fig.[fig : inter ] ) , and these are the atoms along the edges and vertices of each layer .",
    "the atoms from the first sub layer diffuse by migrating first to the surface , and then diffusing upon the surface , until mixing back into the first sub layer .",
    "as the temperature increases to @xmath13 , the facets shrink and the number of diffusing edge atoms increases , until all surface atoms are diffusing just below @xmath13 .    to substantiate the above picture , we plot in fig.[fig : ellipsoid ] the displacement ellipsoids , defined in section [ sec : diff ] , for all atoms initially on the surface of our @xmath144 cluster .",
    "we show results for temperatures @xmath174 , @xmath0 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 k , corresponding to the same temperatures for which we showed the average cluster shape in fig.[fig : average ] . in the top row",
    "we show ellipsoids averaged over a simulated time of @xmath221 ns . we expect that atoms which are diffusing , with @xmath222 , should have their displacement ellipsoid roughly double in size when the time interval goes up by a factor of four . hence in the bottom row of fig.[fig : ellipsoid ] we then show results for a simulated time of @xmath163 ns , i.e. four times longer than the top row .",
    "we observe the following . at @xmath174",
    "k there is no observable diffusion of surface atoms . at @xmath0",
    "k we see diffusion of atoms at the vertices of the ih cluster . at @xmath175",
    "k we see stronger diffusion at the vertices , as well as diffusion along the edges .",
    "one also can see several of the ellipsoids oriented normal to the surface , indicating atoms which are mixing in with the first sub layer .",
    "atoms at the centers of the facets remain without diffusion . at @xmath176",
    "k and above most of the atoms are clearly diffusing .",
    "we have carried out long time equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the behavior of gold nanoclusters cooled from the liquid , and their subsequent melting upon reheating . for three different generic cluster sizes , @xmath145 , @xmath183 , and @xmath37",
    ", we found that the cooled clusters formed a slightly asymmetric mackay icosahedral ( ih ) structure with a missing central atom .    using the above clusters cooled from the melt , as well as several other `` magic number '' mackay icosahedra with up to @xmath149 atoms that we constructed by hand @xcite at low temperature , we slowly heated these clusters up through melting .",
    "measuring surface and bulk bond orientational order parameters we find a sharp cluster melting transition at a temperature @xmath223 that increases with cluster size , and that the @xmath3 facets on the surface do not premelt but remain ordered up until @xmath13 .",
    "the surface bond parameters however decrease from their perfect ih values significantly below @xmath224 , indicating a softening of the surface prior to melting .",
    "we find that the onset of this surface softening appears to track the size dependent melting , occuring roughly @xmath225 k below @xmath223 .",
    "looking at the average shape of our clusters , we see that this surface softening corresponds to a rounding of the edges and vertices of the cluster , with a corresponding shrinkage of the @xmath3 facet area . just below the melting",
    "@xmath13 the average cluster shape is nearly spherical .",
    "as the temperature increases towards melting , and in the liquid above @xmath13 , instantaneous cluster configurations can display large thermal fluctuations about this average shape .",
    "measuring the diffusion of atoms in the cluster , we conclude that the mechanism for this surface softening is the onset of diffusion of atoms at first the vertices and then the edges of the cluster surface , as temperature is increased . as temperature further increases ,",
    "the mobility of these atoms increases , and more and more atoms near the edges of the facets participate in this diffusion , until the number of atoms remaining stationary on the facets becomes almost negligibly small near @xmath13 .",
    "simultaneous with this increasing diffusion is an increase in interlayer mixing , with surface and first sub layers mixing first , and then deeper layers mixing in as one approaches close to @xmath13 .",
    "a similar rounding of edges and shrinking of facets occur in the theory of the equilibrium shape of macroscopically large crystals , where the continuum wulff construction @xcite can be applied . in this theory ,",
    "the shrinkage of facets is associated with approaching a roughening transition of the faceted surface , and the facet length shrinks proportionally to the inverse of the roughening correlation length @xcite .",
    "we do not believe that this theory explains the results for our clusters .",
    "firstly , it is generally believed @xcite that the @xmath3 gold surface that forms the facets of our cluster does not have a roughening transition below the bulk melting transition .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that the surface softening of our clusters seems to track the size dependent cluster melting temperature rather than approaching a size independent onset temperature as would be expected if there was a true thermodynamic roughening transition .",
    "moreover , the vanishing of facets at the roughening transition occurs within the context of the crystalline state ; no diffusion of atoms need be involved . in our case",
    "it is clear that diffusion of atoms along the vertices and edges plays an important role .",
    "we therefore believe that the phenomena we observe in our simulated nanoclusters are due specifically to the finite , relatively small , size of our clusters , for which continuum approaches are not valid and one must consider the atomistic nature of the system .",
    "the rounding of edges and shrinkage of facets that we observe are better attributed to a  melting \" of the cluster edges , which then spreads out into the ordered facets as the temperature increases towards melting .",
