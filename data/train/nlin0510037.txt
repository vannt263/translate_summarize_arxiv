    "studies of some epidemics , for example , the spread of the black death in europe from 13471350 @xcite , the past influenza pandemics rvachev95 , spread of fox rabies in europe , or spread of rabies among raccoons in eastern united states and canada @xcite , indicate that host and infective interactions and spatial distributions of their populations should play an important role in the dynamics of spread of many infectious diseases .",
    "until recently most mathematical models of spread of epidemics have described interactions of large number of individuals in aggregate form and often these models have neglected aspects of spatial distribution of populations , importance of which have been addressed in @xcite . adopting methodologies like cellular automata , coupled map lattices , lattice gas cellular automata or agent based simulations , new classes of models",
    "have been proposed and studied @xcite , to incorporate with various levels of abstraction and details : direct interactions among individuals ; spatial distribution of population types ( i.e. , infective , susceptible , removed ) ; individuals movement ; effects of social networks on spread of epidemics .",
    "the goal of our work is to study the effects of population interactions and mixing on the spatio - temporal dynamics of spread of epidemics of sir ( susceptible - infected - removed ) type in a realistic population distribution . for the purpose of our study we developed a fully discrete individually - based simulation model that incorporates the random nature of disease transmission .",
    "the key feature of this model is the fact that for each individual the set of all individuals with whom he / she interacts may change with time .",
    "this results in time varying small world network structure .    as a case study we considerder census data obtained from statistic canada @xcite for southern and central ontario .",
    "the data set specifies population of small areas composed of one or more neighbouring street blocks , called dissemination areas . using these data , we study the effects of two types of interactions among individuals on the spread of epidemics .",
    "the first type of interaction is the one among individuals located only in adjacent dissemination areas .",
    "the second type of interaction is the one among individuals who in addition to being in contact with members of their own and adjacent dissemination areas may also be in contact with individuals located in remote , non adjacent , dissemination areas .",
    "this last case can be seen as a case of `` short - cuts '' among multiple far away dissemination areas .",
    "we investigate spatial correlations in our model and how they can be destroyed by the `` short - cuts '' in population contacts .",
    "additionally , we derive a mean field description of our individually based simulation model and compare the results of the two models .",
    "the presented work is continuation and expansion of our work in paper15,paper16,paper24 and contributes to better understanding of spread of epidemics of sir type , including influenza .",
    "in order to study how population interactions ( `` population mixing '' ) affects the spread of epidemics we construct an individually based model in which each individual is represented by a particle , as in our earlier work paper15,paper16 .",
    "models of this type take various forms , ranging from stochastic interacting particle systems @xcite to models based on cellular automata or coupled map lattices  schon93,bc93,duryea99,benyo2000 .    in our model",
    ", we consider a set of @xmath0 individuals , labelled with consecutive integers @xmath1 .",
    "this set of labels is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that each individual , at any given time can be in one of three , mutually exclusive , distinct states : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) or removed ( r ) .",
    "an individual can change state only in two ways : a susceptible individual who comes in direct contact with an infected individual can become infected with probability @xmath3 ; an infected individual can become removed with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the precise description of the model is as follows .",
    "the state of the @xmath5-th individual at the time step @xmath6 is described by a boolean vector variable @xmath7 , where @xmath8 if the @xmath5-th individual is in the state @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "thus , @xmath12we assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 , that is , the time is discrete .",
    "hence , the only allowed values of the vector @xmath15 are @xmath16 no other values of @xmath15 are possible in sir epidemic model . in sir model",
    "an individual can only be at one state at any give time and transitions occur only from susceptible to infected and from infected to removed .",
    "a removed individual does not become susceptible or infected again in sir model .",
    "therefore , sir model is suitable for studying spread of influenza in the same season because the same type of influenza virus can infect an individual only once and once the individual is recovered from the flu it becomes immune to this type of virus .",
    "we further assume that at time step @xmath6 the @xmath5-th individual can interact with individuals from a subset of @xmath2 , to be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "using this notation , after one time iteration the @xmath18 becomes @xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a sequence of iid boolean random variables such that @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a sequence@xmath26of iid boolean variables such that @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the sequences @xmath29 and @xmath30 of random variables are independent of each other and of the random variables @xmath31    observe that , if the @xmath5-th individual interacts with an infected @xmath32-th individual at time step @xmath6 and @xmath33 then the infection is transmitted from the @xmath32-th individual to the @xmath5-th individual at this time step .",
    "thus , if some product @xmath34 takes the value 1 , then @xmath35 , meaning that the @xmath5-th individual has changed its state from susceptible to infected .",
    "the key feature of this model is the set @xmath17 , representing all individuals with whom the @xmath5-th individual may have interacted at time step @xmath6 . in a large human population , it is almost impossible to know @xmath17 for each individual , so we make some simplifying assumptions . first of all , it is clear that the spatial distribution of individuals must be reflected in the structure of @xmath17 .",
    "we have decided to use realistic population distribution for southern and central ontario using census data obtained from statistic canada @xcite .",
    "the selected region is mostly surrounded by waters of great lakes , forming natural boundary conditions",
    ". the data set specifies population of so called dissemination areas  , that is , small areas composed of one or more neighbouring street blocks",
    ". we had access to longitude and latitude data with accuracy of roughly @xmath36 , hence some dissemination areas in densely populated regions have the same geographical coordinates .",
    "we combined these dissemination areas into larger units , to be called modified dissemination areas(mda ) .",
    "we now define the set @xmath17 using the concept of mdas .",
    "this set is characterized by two positive integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let us label all mdas in the region we are considering by integers @xmath39 , where in our case @xmath40 . for the @xmath5-th",
    "individual belonging to the @xmath41-th mda , the set @xmath17 consists of all individuals belonging to the @xmath41-th mda plus all individuals belonging to the @xmath37 mdas nearest to the @xmath41-th mda and the @xmath38 mdas randomly selected among all remaining mdas .",
    "while the close neighbours , that is , the @xmath37 nearest mdas , will not change with time , the far neighbours , that is , the @xmath38 randomly selected mdas , will be randomly reselected at each time step .",
    "the model described in the previous section involves strong spatial coupling between individuals .",
    "before we describe consequences of this fact , we first construct a set of equations which approximate dynamics of the model under the assumption of perfect mixing , in other words , neglecting the spatial coupling .    the state of the system described by eq .",
    "( [ sirdyn1][sirdyn3 ] ) at time step @xmath6 is determined by the states of all individuals and is described by the boolean random field @xmath42 . under the assumptions of our model ,",
    "the boolean field @xmath43 is a markov stochastic process .    by taking the expectation @xmath44 of this markov stochastic process",
    "when the initial configuration is @xmath45 we get the probabilities of the @xmath5-th individual being susceptible , or infected , or removed at time @xmath6 , that is , @xmath46 $ ] for @xmath47 .",
    "since the sequences of random variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent of each other and of the sequences of the random variables @xmath48 , assuming additionally independence of random variables @xmath48 , the expected value of a product of these variables is equal to the product of expected values . under these mean field assumptions , taking expected values of both sides of equations ( [ sirdyn1][sirdyn3 ] ) we obtain @xmath49since mean field approximations neglect spatial correlations , we further assume that @xmath50 is independent of @xmath5 , that is @xmath51 . even though sets @xmath17 have different number of elements for different @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for the purpose of this approximate derivation we assume that they all have the same number of elements @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the average mda population .",
    "all these assumptions lead to @xmath54the third equation in the above set is obviously redundant , since @xmath55 .    similarly to the classical kermack - mckendrick model , mean field equations ( [ mf1])-([mf3 ] )",
    "exhibit a threshold phenomenon .",
    "depending on the choice of parameters , we can have @xmath56 for all @xmath6 , meaning that the infection is not growing and eventually it will die out because in our model no new individuals are being born or arrive from outside the area under consideration during the time of the epidemic .",
    "alternatively , we can have @xmath57 for some @xmath6 , meaning that the epidemic is spreading .",
    "the intermediate scenario of constant @xmath58 will occur when @xmath59 , that is , when @xmath60assuming that initially the entire population consists only of susceptible and infective individuals , that is , there are no individuals in the removed group at @xmath61we have @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath52 is large , we can assume @xmath63 .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ trecond ] ) for @xmath4 under these assumptions we obtain @xmath64thus , assuming the mean field approximation the epidemic can occur only if @xmath65 .",
    "the mean - field equations derived in the previous section depend only on the sum of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this means , for example , that the model with @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the model with @xmath68 , @xmath69 will have the same mean field equations .",
    "however , the actual dynamics in these two cases are very different , see figure [ fig : frontlow ] and figure fig : frontdest . depending on the relative size of @xmath38 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the epidemic may propagate or die out , as the following analysis shows . in order to make the subsequent analysis more convenient",
    ", we introduce parameter @xmath70 , defined as @xmath71let @xmath72 be the expected value of the total number of individuals belonging to class @xmath73 , that is , @xmath74we say that an epidemic occurs if there exists @xmath75 such that @xmath76 . for fixed @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 ,",
    "there exists a threshold value of @xmath4 to be denoted by @xmath77 , such that for each @xmath78 an epidemic occurs , and for @xmath79 it does not occur .",
    "obviously @xmath77 depends on @xmath3 , and this is illustrated in figure  [ phasetran1 ] , which shows graphs of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath3 for several different values of @xmath70 , where @xmath80 .",
    "the graphs were obtained numerically by direct computer simulations of the model .",
    "the condition @xmath80 means that the size of the neighbourhood is kept constant , but the proportion of far neighbours(represented by @xmath70 ) varies .    , and @xmath81 .",
    "the first line from the bottom represents mean field approximation . ]",
    "figure  [ phasetran1 ] also shows the mean - field line given by eq .",
    "( separatmf ) .",
    "we observe that the parameter @xmath70 controls dynamics of the epidemic process in a significant way , shifting the critical line up or down .",
    "when @xmath82 , that is , when there are no interactions with far neighbours , the epidemic process has a strictly local nature , and we can observe well defined epidemic fronts propagating in space , regardless at which mda the epidemic starts at @xmath83 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : frontlow ] , where the epidemic starts at a single centrally located mda with low population density ( figure fig : frontlowa ) and on figure [ fig : fronthigh ] , where the epidemic starts in a mda with high population density ( figure [ fig : fronthigh]a ) .",
    "the simulations were done for the same parameters in both cases except for the different locations of the onsets of epidemics .",
    "the figures display mdas that are represented by pixels colored according to the density of individuals of a given type .",
    "the red component of the color represents density of infected individuals , green density of susceptibles , and blue density of removed individuals . by density we mean the number of individuals of a given type divided by the size of the population of the mda .    , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , with ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath86 , ( c ) @xmath87 and ( d ) @xmath88 .",
    "the initial outbreak is located in an area with low population density .",
    "modified dissemination areas are represented by pixels colored according to density of individuals of a given type , such that the red component represents density of infected , green density of susceptibles , and blue density of removed individuals . ]",
    "the epidemic waves propagating outwards can be clearly seen on figure fig : frontlow and figure [ fig : fronthigh ] , in the successive snapshots ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) . the fronts are mostly red .",
    "this means that the bulk of infected individuals is located at the fronts .",
    "after these individuals gradually recover the centers become blue .",
    "let us now consider slightly modified parameters , taking @xmath89 .",
    "this means that we now replace one close  mda by one farmda .",
    "this does not seem to be a significant change , yet the effect of this change is truly noticeable .    , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , with ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath90 , ( c ) @xmath91 and ( d ) @xmath87 .",
    "colour coding is the same as in the previous figure . ]",
    "as we can see in figure  [ fig : frontdest ] , the epidemic propagates much faster , and there are no visible fronts .",
    "the disease quickly spreads over the entire region and large metropolitan areas become red in a short time , as shown in figure  [ fig : frontdest](b ) .",
    "this suggests that infected individuals are more likely to be found in densely populated regions , and their distribution is dictated by the population distribution  unlike in figure  [ fig : frontlow ] or figure  [ fig : fronthigh ] , where infected individuals are to be found mainly at the propagating front .",
    "in order to quantify the observations of the previous section , we use a spatial correlation function for densities of infected individuals defined as @xmath92where @xmath93 is the distance between @xmath5-th and @xmath32-th individual , and @xmath94 represents averaging over all pairs @xmath5 , @xmath32 satisfying condition @xmath95 . in the following considerations we take @xmath96 .",
    "the distance between two individuals is defined as the distance between mdas to which they belong .",
    "consider now a specific example of the epidemic process described by eq .",
    "( [ sirdyn1]-[sirdyn3 ] ) , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . for this choice of parameters epidemics always occur as long as @xmath100 .",
    "figure [ cor3d ] shows graphs of the correlation functions @xmath101 at the peak of each epidemic , so that @xmath102 is the time step at which the number of infected individuals achieves its maximum value .     for different values of @xmath103 , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath104 .",
    "]    an interesting phenomenon can be observed in the figure under consideration : while the increase of the proportion of far  neighbours does destroy spatial correlations , one needs very high proportion of farneighbours to make the correlation curve completely flat . in bonabeau1998",
    "it is reported that for influenza epidemics @xmath105 .",
    "if we fit @xmath106 curve to the correlation data shown in figure [ cor3d ] , we obtain values of the exponent @xmath107 as shown in figure [ alpha ] . in order to obtain @xmath107 of comparably small magnitude as reported in @xcite , one would have to take @xmath70 equal to at least @xmath108 , meaning that vast majority of neighbours would have to be far neighbours .     for different values of the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the exponent has been obtained by fitting @xmath109 to simulation data . ]    in reality , this would require that the vast majority of all individuals one interacted with were not his / her neighbours , coworkers , etc . , but individuals from randomly selected and possibly remote geographical regions .",
    "this is clearly at odds with our intuition regarding social interactions , especially outside large metropolitan areas .",
    "this prompted us to investigate further and to find out what is responsible for this effect .",
    "upon closer examination of spatial patterns generated in simulations of our individually - based model , we reach the conclusion that the inhomogeneity of population sizes in neighbourhoods @xmath17 makes spatial correlations so persistent .",
    "since different mdas have different population sizes , we expect that some individuals will have larger neighbourhood populations than others , and as a result they will be more likely to get infected , even if the proportion of infected individuals is the same in all mdas .",
    "this will build up clusters of infected individuals around populous mdas .    to test if this is indeed the factor responsible for strong spatial correlations in our model , we replaced all mda population sizes with a constant population size @xmath53 , that is , the average mda population size .",
    "as expected , graphs of the correlation functions obtained in this case were are all essentially flat , with the exponent @xmath107 close to zero even in the case of @xmath69 , when we obtained @xmath110 .",
    "we conclude that spatial correlations are difficult to destroy if neighbourhood sizes are inhomogeneous",
    ". very significant amount of long - range interactions ( i.e. , very strong mixings ) is required to obtain flat correlations curves . however , for homogeneous neighbourhood sizes , even relatively small long - range interaction immediately forces the process into the perfect - mixing regime , resulting in the lack of spatial correlations .",
    "the model that we developed can be applied to other realistic population distributions and geographical regions ."
