    "models of opinion formation have been studied by physicists since the 80 s and are now part of the new branch of physics called sociophysics @xcite .",
    "this recent research area uses tools and concepts of statistical physics to describe some aspects of social and political behavior @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , opinion models are interesting to physicists because they present order - disorder transitions , scaling and universality , among other typical features of physical systems @xcite .    following the success of the ising model to capture the essential physics of complex systems , several opinion models have been proposed based on @xmath3 ( i.e. , spin-@xmath4 ) state variables @xcite .",
    "the first paper that considered the ising model to describe a social system was proposed by galam @xcite .",
    "the spin - spin coupling of the ising hamiltonian represents the agent - agent interaction , whereas the magnetic field represents the effects of propaganda .",
    "moreover , local ( or individual ) fields are introduced that reflect agent preference toward each orientation ( or opinion ) .",
    "depending on the strength of the local fields , the system may reach full consensus toward one of the two possible opinions @xmath5 or @xmath6 , or a state in which both opinions coexist . in the last 30 years",
    "many other opinion models based on ising variables have been proposed @xcite . among them",
    ", we highlight the voter model @xcite , the majority - rule models @xcite , the sznajd model @xcite and the coda ( continuous opinion and discrete actions ) model @xcite . besides the affinity by either one of two distinct opinions or attitudes",
    ", one can also consider the possibility that individuals may remain undecided @xcite .",
    "this more realistic situation , that we will consider here , can be associated to spin-1 systems , in which the state variables can assume also a null value , besides @xmath3 .    in order to make the models even more realistic , other psycho - social ingredients can be taken into account .",
    "the so - called * contrarians * are agents who always have the opposite opinion to that of the majority of the surrounding agents @xcite .",
    "the consideration of such agents affects opinion dynamics , and their impact on opinion formation has been studied in a series of models @xcite .",
    "another category of agents are the * intransigents * , whose stubbornness or inflexibility makes them reluctant to change their opinions .",
    "this class of agents was firstly introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and they received later the name inflexible agents or just inflexibles in ref .",
    "@xcite . after these works , many other papers considered the effect of inflexibles in opinion dynamics @xcite .",
    "in this work we study a three - state kinetic model of opinion formation , in which the dynamics evolves according to pairwise competitive interactions and where both contrarian and inflexible features are considered .",
    "our results suggest that the presence of inflexible agents affects the critical behavior of the system , causing either the shift of the critical point or the suppression of the phase transition , depending on the opinion group intransigents belong to .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic rules that define the model .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in section 3 , and our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "our model is based on kinetic exchange opinion models @xcite .",
    "a population of @xmath7 agents is defined on a fully - connected graph , i.e. , each agent can interact with all others , which characterizes a mean - field - like scheme .",
    "each individual @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) carries one of three possible opinions or attitudes at a given time step @xmath10 , represented by @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "this scenario mimics any polarized public debate , for example an electoral process with two different candidates a and b , where each agent ( or elector ) votes for the candidate a ( opinion @xmath5 ) , for the candidate b ( opinion @xmath6 ) or remains undecided ( opinion @xmath12 ) .",
    "in addition , there is a fraction @xmath2 of agents that are averse to change their opinions , the so - called inflexible agents .",
    "each interaction occurs between two given agents @xmath8 and @xmath13 , such that @xmath13 will influence @xmath8 .",
    "the following rules govern the dynamics :    1 .",
    "a pair of agents @xmath14 is randomly chosen ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath8 is an inflexible agent nothing occurs , because he / she can not be persuaded to change opinion ; 3 .   on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath8 is not an inflexible agent , his / her opinion in the next time step @xmath15 will be updated according to @xmath16\\,,\\ ] ] where the sign function is defined such that @xmath17 and the couplings @xmath18 are given by the discrete bimodal probability distribution @xmath19    notice that the above rules impose that for an agent to shift from state @xmath20 to @xmath21 or vice - versa it must to pass by the intermediate state @xmath22 . the above process is repeated @xmath7 times , which defines one time step in the simulations .",
    "the pairwise couplings may be either negative ( with probability @xmath0 ) or positive ( with probability @xmath1 ) , such that @xmath0 represents the fraction of negative couplings @xcite .",
    "in other words , a disorder is introduced in the system , and we will consider that the stochastic random variables @xmath23 can be either quenched ( fixed in time ) or annealed ( changing with time ) , as in @xcite . the influence of one individual over another does not need to be reciprocal ( i.e. , not necessarily @xmath24 ) , however , whether interactions are symmetric or not , naturally does not affect the results .",
    "the intransigents ( a fraction @xmath2 of the population ) are randomly selected at the beginning of the simulation , maintaining that character throughout the dynamics , as considered in the galam model @xcite .    in the absence of intransigents , there is a nonequilibrium order - disorder phase transition at a critical fraction @xmath25 @xcite . for @xmath26 one of the extreme opinions",
    "@xmath5 or @xmath6 dominates the system , with consensus states occurring only for @xmath27 , i.e. , in the absence of negative interactions . on the other hand , for @xmath28",
    "the system is in a disordered , `` paramagnetic '' , phase characterized by the coexistence of the three opinions , with the fraction of each opinion being @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , it has already been argued @xcite that negative couplings produce a similar effect to that of the introduction of the galams contrarians @xcite , since the main consequence of such negative couplings is to make that interacting agents with the same opinions move to the undecided state ( opinion @xmath12 ) . in this sense , our model contains both contrarian and inflexible features .    in the simulations ,",
    "we have considered two kinds of random couplings @xmath18 , quenched and annealed , as well as two kinds of updating schemes , synchronous ( or parallel ) and asynchronous ( or sequential ) updates .",
    "systems were prepared in fully - disordered initial states , i.e. , we started all simulations with an equal fraction of each opinion ( 1/3 for each one ) . in the next section",
    "we will present our results .",
    "we analyze the critical behavior of the system , in analogy to magnetic spin systems , by computing the order parameter @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a disorder or configurational average .",
    "it is sensitive to the unbalance between extreme opinions .",
    "notice that @xmath32 plays the role of the `` magnetization per spin '' in magnetic systems .",
    "in addition , we also consider the fluctuations @xmath33 of the order parameter ( or `` susceptibility '' ) @xmath34 and the binder cumulant @xmath35 , defined as @xcite @xmath36    we analyzed three distinct cases , according to whether the inflexible agents are ( i ) chosen independently of their initial opinions ; ( ii ) chosen only among the agents with extreme ( @xmath3 ) opinions ; or ( iii ) restricted to a given group of opinion ( @xmath37 or @xmath6 or @xmath12 ) . in the following subsections",

    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ] , for a population of @xmath39 agents .",
    "note the strong impact of the change of the parameter @xmath2 on the behavior of the order parameter @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , given a fixed value of @xmath2 , the curve of @xmath32 is not affected by the nature of the random variables @xmath23 nor by the kind of update scheme used .",
    "consensus states are obtained only in a very specific case : in the absence of both intransigents ( @xmath41 ) and negative interactions ( @xmath27 ) . in other words ,",
    "the maximal value of the order parameter @xmath32 is smaller than one for all values of @xmath42 , independently of @xmath0 . in real systems ,",
    "full consensus , with @xmath43 , occurs in particular situations where a government exerts a social control , through propaganda or policies that lead to a full acceptance of the _ status quo _ , while collective states with @xmath44 represent more `` democratic '' frequently observed situations @xcite .",
    "thus , in this sense the inclusion of inflexible agents makes the model more realistic .    for sufficiently large @xmath2 the system is always found in a disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase , but for small values of @xmath2 the system orders at specific points that depend on @xmath2 .",
    "in order to locate the critical points @xmath45 numerically , we have performed simulations for different population sizes @xmath7 .",

    "the origin of this difference is again related to the agents with @xmath74 opinions , as discussed in the beginning of this section .",
    "in fact , as the presence of non - inflexible agents with @xmath74 opinions favors the ordering in the system , as discussed above , the critical fraction @xmath70 becomes larger in the present case than in the case where the inflexibility is not restricted and can be a characteristic of a given individual independently of his opinion .",

    "our results show that when we consider the inflexible agents distributed only among the agents carrying a given opinion , the critical behavior is identical to that of the model in the absence of intransigents ( @xmath41 ) @xcite , when the considered opinion is @xmath74 , i.e. , we have a transition at @xmath25 . on the other hand , if the inflexibility is related to the extreme opinions @xmath37 or @xmath69 , the phase transition is suppressed .",
    "in this work , we have studied a discrete - state opinion model where each agent carries one of three possible opinions or attitudes , represented by variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "the microscopic rules define that agents with the extreme opinions @xmath3 should pass by the intermediate ( undecided ) state @xmath12 before adopting the opposite extreme opinion .",
    "we have considered a population of @xmath7 agents in the mean - field limit , where each individual can interact with all others .",
    "the competitive interactions , ruled by negative ( with probability @xmath0 ) and positive ( with probability @xmath1 ) couplings , produce an effect similar to galam s contrarians .",
    "moreover , a fraction @xmath2 of the population is constituted by intransigents , averse to change their opinions . in this sense ,",
    "our model takes into account both contrarians and intransigents in the process of opinion formation .    the subset of inflexible agents ( a fraction @xmath2 of the population ) is randomly selected at the beginning of the simulation , keeping the inflexible character throughout the dynamics",
    "this is a realistic social feature . indeed",
    ", intransigent individuals usually do not change their attitude with time .",
    "we have analyzed cases where the inflexiblity is not restricted to a given opinion group , as well as cases where inflexibility is associated to the extreme ( @xmath3 ) opinions or to a given group supporting one of the three possible attitudes .",
    "moreover , we have also considered that the agents states ( opinions ) are updated by means of either sequential ( asynchronous ) or parallel ( synchronous ) schemes .    in the first formulation of the model ,",
    "the inflexible agents are chosen independently of their opinions . by analyzing the quantities of interest ( magnetization per spin , susceptibility and binder cumulant )",
    ", we have found that the system exhibits continuous nonequilibrium phase transitions between an ordered phase and a disordered one .",
    "the transition points depend on the density @xmath2 of intransigents , similarly to what happens in other models @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that the values of @xmath45 decrease for increasing values of @xmath2 , hence the disordered phase broadens with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "numerical outcomes suggest that there is a critical density @xmath63 above which the system can not order , i.e. , the system is in a fully - disordered ( paramagnetic ) state , for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "the critical exponents on the order - disorder frontier are the same , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , independently of @xmath2 , which means a universality in the model .",
    "these results are not affected by the update scheme used ( synchronous or asynchronous ) nor by the nature of the random couplings ( quenched or annealed ) .    in the second formulation of the model",
    ", the inflexible agents are chosen only among the agents with ( initially ) extreme opinions . in this case , the model behavior is qualitatively similar to the previous one . however , the critical density in this case is greater , @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the ordered phase is larger when the agents with @xmath74 opinions are free to interact , which is the main fact responsible for the observed differences .",
    "however , the critical behavior of the model is robust with respect to the selection of the inflexible agents .",
    "in fact , the critical exponents on the order - disorder frontier are the same as in the previous case , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , independently of @xmath2 .",
    "this confirms the universal behavior of that phase transition .",
    "again , this result is not affected by the update scheme used ( synchronous or asynchronous ) nor by the nature of the random interactions ( quenched or annealed ) .",
    "we have also considered the case where the inflexible agents are chosen among the individuals with a given initial opinion . for the case where this opinion is @xmath74 , the critical behavior of the system is not affected by the presence of the intransigent agents ,",
    "i.e. , the phase transition occurs at @xmath25 for all values of @xmath2 . on the other hand , when the intransigents are chosen among the agents with opinion @xmath37 ( or alternatively , @xmath69 )",
    ", the phase transition does not occur anymore .",
    "this conclusion was supported by the behavior of the quantities of interest .",
    "in fact , the order parameter and the susceptibility curves do not depend on the system size , and the binder cumulant curves for different population sizes do not cross .",
    "all these features suggest the absence of the order - disorder transition @xcite .",
    "notice that in the cases where the phase transition occurs , the critical exponents are always the same , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this is an expected result , since we are dealing with a mean - field formulation of the model , where each agent can interact with all others .",
    "observe that the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the same as the mean - field exponents of the ising model , but the exponent @xmath48 presents a different value . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , interpreting @xmath48 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the effective dimension in this long - ranged model and considering this effective dimension as @xmath92 , then the value of the effective correlation length exponent becomes @xmath93 , that coincides with the mean - field value .",
    "our results also show that the particular nature of the random couplings @xmath94 , as well as of the update scheme , does not affect the results .",
    "this may seem an obvious result , however , in other variants of the kinetic exchange opinion model , we observed that the results can be affected by numerical considerations like the fluctuation or not of the pairwise interactions @xmath94 ( annealed and quenched versions , respectively ) , or the synchronous or asynchronous update scheme , as recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the simplicity of our model , it can be relevant for the description of real social systems . in our model",
    ", @xmath95 represents a favorable opinion and @xmath69 an unfavorable one , while @xmath74 means indecision .",
    "the order parameter considered corresponds to the overall rating and an ordered state means there is a clearcut decision made .",
    "a disordered state means the absence of a decision .",
    "thus , the contrarian effect , quantified by the parameter @xmath0 , induces a disordered phase for sufficiently large @xmath0 . in addition",
    ", the inclusion of inflexible agents , quantified by the parameter @xmath2 , makes this effect more pronounced , since the critical points @xmath70 decrease for increasing values of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the presence of such two effects , contrarians and intransigents , favors the disordered state , indicating that in the presence of extremists it is more difficult to reach a final decision in a public debate , which is a realistic feature of the model .",
    "in addition , the results show that the consensus states are never obtained when inflexible agents are present .",
    "this is also realistic in elections or public debates in general .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of consensus states with the order parameter @xmath43 occurs in very particular situations , whereas the states with partial order ( @xmath44 ) are more common @xcite .",
    "we hope that theoretical opinion models considering realistic individuals like contrarians and intransigents may also guide proper new experiments ( such as inquiries or surveys ) to be conducted for improving the construction of agent - based models , as well as for the validation of such models .",
