    "<S> pure multiparticle quantum states are called absolutely maximally entangled if all reduced states obtained by tracing out at least half of the particles are maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that a seven - qubit state whose three - body marginals are all maximally mixed does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we obtain an upper limit on the possible number of maximally mixed three - body marginals and identify the state saturating the bound . </S>",
    "<S> this solves the seven - qubit problem as the last open case concerning maximally entangled states of qubits , but our methods can also be applied to other scenarios .    for a pure multipartite quantum state </S>",
    "<S> maximal entanglement is present across a bipartition if the smaller of the two corresponding reduced systems is maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> it is then a natural question to ask wether or not there exist quantum states for any number of parties @xmath0 , such that all of its reduced states of @xmath1 parties are maximally mixed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , maximal entanglement across all bipartitions is present and , accordingly , these states are also known as absolutely maximally entangled ( ame ) states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the local dimension is chosen large enough , ame states always exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for qubits , however , the situation is only partially resolved . for three qubits </S>",
    "<S> the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state is an ame state since all the single - qubit reduced states are maximally mixed . for four qubits </S>",
    "<S> it was realized quite early that ame states do not exist @xcite , and based on that the best approximations ( where not all reduced states are maximally mixed ) of ame states have been found @xcite . for five and six qubits ame states </S>",
    "<S> are known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these can be represented as graph states @xcite and correspond to additive or stabilizer codes @xcite . for more than eight qubits , </S>",
    "<S> ame states do not exist @xcite , but the case of seven qubits is still unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results give some evidence for the absence of such a state @xcite , on the other hand , some approximation has been presented  @xcite .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we prove that ame states for seven qubits do not exist ; we also prove the optimality of the known approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we can directly formulate the first result :    * observation 1 . </S>",
    "<S> * _ consider a pure state of seven qubits . </S>",
    "<S> then not all of its three - body reduced density matrices can be maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> _    _ proof . _ assume we have a pure seven - qubit state @xmath2 , whose three - body marginals are all maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , all two - body marginals are maximally mixed , too . </S>",
    "<S> since the total state is pure , this implies that any of its five - party reduced density matrices is proportional to a projector , @xmath3 here and in the following , @xmath4 denotes the reduced state on @xmath5 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> note that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ projequation ] ) holds for all possible five - qubit reductions .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , a schmidt decomposition of the pure state @xmath6 across the bipartitions @xmath7 and @xmath8 yields @xmath9 again , analogous equations hold for any possible four- or five - qubit reduction </S>",
    "<S> .    we will use these three equations to obtain a contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> for this , let us expand @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the bloch basis @xmath12 here , @xmath13 denotes the sum of all pauli operators having weight four in the reduced state @xmath10 of parties @xmath14 , that is , @xmath13 is of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 in the same spirit , @xmath17 and @xmath18 consist of the sum of all pauli operators of weight four and weight five respectively in the reduced state @xmath11 of parties @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of an operator is the number of qubits its acts non - trivially on , and the identity on subsystem @xmath20 is written as @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> inserting eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ blochfourequation ] , [ blochfiveequation ] ) into eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evequation1 ] , [ evequation2 ] ) results in the eigenvalue relations @xmath22 we similarly insert eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ blochfiveequation ] ) in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ projequation ] ) to obtain @xmath23 the key observation now is that only certain products occurring on the left - hand side of this equation can contribute to @xmath18 on the right - hand side . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath24 on the left - hand side can not contribute to @xmath18 on the right - hand side . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that a product of two five - fold tensor products of pauli matrices can never result in a hermitian five - fold tensor product of pauli matrices , since an imaginary coefficient will occur . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath25 on the left - hand side can not contribute to @xmath18 on the right - hand side .    </S>",
    "<S> so we can collect terms of weight five on both sides of the equation . denoting the anti - commutator by @xmath26 , we are left with @xmath27 tensoring with the identity and multiplying by @xmath6 from the right leads to @xmath28 however , using the eigenvalue relations eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evequation1 ] , [ evequation2 ] ) , one arrives at a contradiction @xmath29 this ends the proof . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30    to start our discussion , note that not all constraints imposed by the reduced states have been taken into account in the derivation . in fact , we only needed a single five - qubit reduced state ( say , for definiteness , on the qubits @xmath19 ) fulfilling the eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ projequation ] , [ evequation2 ] ) , whose three - body reduced density matrices are all maximally mixed [ this was needed for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ blochfiveequation ] ) ] . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , the five four - qubit reduced density matrices corresponding to the possible subsets of @xmath19 have to obey eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evequation1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus one can try to answer a relaxation of the original question : given a seven - qubit state whose two - party reduced states are all maximally mixed , how many of its three - party reduced states can then be maximally mixed ? </S>",
    "<S> consider a pure seven - qubit state where all two - body marginals are maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that any of the @xmath31 possible @xmath11 obeys eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ projequation ] , [ evequation2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath32 possible @xmath33 and corresponding @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if a single three - qubit reduced state @xmath33 ( say , @xmath34 for definiteness ) is not maximally mixed , then nine of the @xmath11 can not be used for the proof anymore : first , for six five - qubit subsets ( namely , @xmath35 ) not all three - qubit density matrices are maximally mixed , implying that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ blochfiveequation ] ) is not valid . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for three five - qubit subsets ( namely , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) not all reduced four - qubit subsets obey eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evequation1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if _ two _ three - qubit reduced states are not maximally mixed then at least @xmath39 five - qubit sets still obey the conditions required for the proof . </S>",
    "<S> so we can summarize :    * observation 2 . * </S>",
    "<S> _ let @xmath6 be a pure state of seven qubits , where all two - body reduced density matrices are maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> then , maximally 32 of the 35 three - body density matrices can be maximally mixed . </S>",
    "<S> there exist seven - qubit states for which this bound is reached . </S>",
    "<S> _    we note that the existence of states where 32 of the three - body density matrices are maximally mixed was shown before : ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite presented such a state , which is , up to local unitary transformation , a graph state occurring in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . as a graph state </S>",
    "<S> , the state can be described by the graph in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fano_plane ] . from this graph , </S>",
    "<S> the state is constructed as follows : each vertex in this graph corresponds to a qubit . </S>",
    "<S> one prepares all the qubits in the state @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for any edge connecting the qubits @xmath20 and @xmath41 one applies a two - qubit phase gate @xmath42 to the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the marginals of this state have the right properties can also directly be checked in the stabilizer formalism , as explained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we add that there exists an ame state for seven _ </S>",
    "<S> three_-dimensional systems , which is also a graph state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider ame states of @xmath0 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the method used in the proof for seven qubits can also be applied in the more general @xmath0-qubit case . from it </S>",
    "<S> follows that only for two , three , five , and six qubits ame states can exist , and for these cases explicit solutions are known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a sketch of the proof is presented in the appendix .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that a seven - qubit state with all three - body marginals being maximally mixed can not exist . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we obtain an upper bound on how many three - body marginals can possibly be maximally mixed and we have shown that this bound can be saturated . </S>",
    "<S> further , the same method as in the proof above can be used to show the nonexistence of _ all _ qubit ame states except in the case of two , three , five , and six parties .    </S>",
