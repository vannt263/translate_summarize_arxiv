    "statistical mechanics classifies phases of a given system in thermal equilibrium according to its physical properties . it also explains how changes in the system parameters allow us to transform one phase into another , sometimes abruptly , which results in the phenomenon of phase transitions .",
    "a special kind of phase transitions occurs at zero temperature : such transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations instead of thermal ones and are responsible for the appearance of exotic quantum phases in many areas of physics .",
    "these quantum phase transitions have been a subject of intense research in the last thirty years , and are expected not only to explain interesting behavior of systems at low temperature , but also to lead to new states of matter with desired properties ( e.g. , superconductors , -fluids and -solids , topological insulators @xcite ) .",
    "phase transitions can also occur in systems away from their thermal equilibrium .",
    "for example , this is the case when the system interacts with an environment and , at the same time , is driven by some external coherent source . due to dissipation",
    ", the environment drives the system to a steady state , @xmath0 , which depends on the system and environment parameters , @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 is changed , a sudden change in the system properties may occur , giving rise to a so called _ dissipative phase transition _",
    "( dpt ) @xcite .",
    "dpt have been much less studied than traditional or quantum ones . with the advent of new experimental techniques that allow to observe them experimentally",
    ", they are starting to play an important role @xcite .",
    "moreover they offer the intriguing possibility of observing critical effects non - destructively because of the constant intrinsic exchange between system and environment @xcite . in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics a large variety of toy models exist that describe different kind of transitions .",
    "their study lead to a deep understanding of many of them .",
    "in contrast , in the case of dpt few models have been developed .",
    "the textbook example of a dpt occurs in the dicke model of resonance fluorescence @xcite .",
    "there , a system of spins interacts with a thermal reservoir and is externally driven .",
    "experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite revealed interesting features such as optical multistability , first and second order phase transitions , and bipartite entanglement . in this paper",
    ", we analyze another prototypical open system : the model is closely related to the central spin system ( css ) which has been thoroughly studied in thermal equilibrium @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "it consists of a set of spin-1/2 particles ( in the following referred to as the _ nuclear spins _ ) , uniformly coupled to a single spin-1/2 ( referred to as the _ electron spin _ ) . in the model we consider , the central spin",
    "is externally driven and decays through interaction with a markovian environment .",
    "recently , the css model has found application in the study of solid state systems such as electron and nuclear spins in a quantum dot @xcite or an nitrogen - vacancy - center .    in what follows",
    "we first provide a general framework for analyzing dpt in open systems . in analogy with the analysis of low energy excitations for closed systems ,",
    "it is based on the study of the excitation gap of the system s liouville operator @xmath2 .",
    "we illustrate these considerations using the central spin model . for a fixed dissipation strength @xmath3 , there are two external parameters one can vary , the rabi frequency of the external driving field , @xmath4 , and the zeemann shift , @xmath5 .",
    "we present a complete phase diagram as a function of those parameters , characterize all the phases , and analyze the phase transitions occurring among them . to this end , we develop a series of analytical tools , based on a self - consistent holstein - primakoff approximation , which allows us to understand most of the phase diagram . in addition , we use numerical methods to investigate regions of the diagram where the theory yields incomplete results . combining these techniques",
    ", we can identify two different types of phase transitions , and regions of bistability , spin squeezing , and enhanced spin polarization dynamics .",
    "we will also identify regions where anomalous behavior occurs in the approach to the steady state .",
    "intriguingly , recent experiments with quantum dots , in which the central ( electronic ) spin is driven by a laser and undergoes spontaneous decay , realize a situation very close to the one we study here and show effects such as bistability , enhanced fluctuations , and abrupt changes in polarization in dependence of the system parameters @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : frame ] sets the general theoretical framework underlying our study of dpt .",
    "section  [ sec : iii ] introduces the model , and contains a structured summary of the main results . in section  [ sec : ps ] we develop the theoretical techniques and use those techniques to analyze the various phases and classify the different transitions . thereafter in section  [ sec : rob ] numerical techniques are employed to explain the features of the phase diagram which are not captured by the previous theory .",
    "possible experimental realizations and a generalization of the model to inhomogeneous coupling are discussed in section  [ sec : implementations ] .",
    "finally we summarize the results and discuss potential applications in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the theory of quantum phase transitions in closed systems is a well established and extensively studied area in the field of statistical mechanics .",
    "the typical scenario is the following : a system is described by a hamiltonian , @xmath6 , where @xmath1 denotes a set of systems parameters ( like magnetic fields , interactions strengths , etc ) . at zero temperature and for a fixed set of parameters , @xmath1 ,",
    "the system is described by a quantum state , @xmath7 , fulfilling @xmath8|\\psi_0(g)\\rangle=0 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the ground state energy . as long as the hamiltonian is gapped (",
    "i.e. , the difference between @xmath10 and the first excitation energy is finite ) , any small change in @xmath1 will alter the physical properties related to the state @xmath11 smoothly and we remain in the same phase .",
    "however , if the first excitation gap @xmath12 closes at a given value of the parameters , @xmath13 , it may happen that the properties change abruptly , in which case a phase transition occurs .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the following we adapt analogous notions to the case of dpt and introduce the concepts required for the subsequent study of a particular example of a generic dpt in a central spin model .",
    "we consider a markovian open system , whose evolution is governed by a time - independent master equation @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics describing the system are contractive implying the existence of a steady state .",
    "this steady state @xmath0 is a zero eigenvector to the liouville superoperator @xmath15 .",
    "this way of thinking parallels that of quantum phase transitions , if one replaces @xmath8\\to{\\cal l}(g)$ ] .",
    "despite the fact that these mathematical objects are very different ( the first is a hermitian operator , and the second a hermiticity - preserving superoperator ) , one can draw certain similarities between them .",
    "for instance , for an abrupt change of @xmath0 ( and thus of certain system observables ) it is necessary that the gap in the ( in general complex ) excitation spectrum of the system s liouville operator @xmath16 closes .",
    "the relevant gap in this context is determined by the eigenvalue with largest real part different from zero ( it can be shown that @xmath17 for all eigenvalues of @xmath18 @xcite ) .",
    "the vanishing of the real part of this eigenvalue  from here on referred to as _ asymptotic decay rate _ ( adr ) @xcite  indicates the possibility of a non - analytical change in the steady state and thus is a necessary condition for a phase transition to occur .    in our model system , the liouvillian low excitation spectrum , and the adr in particular ,",
    "can in large parts of the phase diagram be understood from the complex energies of a stable gaussian mode of the nuclear field .",
    "we find first order transitions where the eigenvalue of this stable mode crosses the eigenvalue of a metastable mode at zero in the projection onto the real axis .",
    "the real part of the liouvillian spectrum closes directly as the stable mode turns metastable and vice versa .",
    "a finite difference in the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues across the transition prevents a mixing of the two modes and the emergence of critical phenomena such as a change in the nature of the correlations in the steady state at the critical point .",
    "in contrast , we also find a second order phase transition where the adr vanishes asymptotically as both mode energies become degenerate ( at zero ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "mixing of the two modes at the critical point gives rise to diverging correlations in the nuclear system .",
    "this observation parallels the classification of quantum phase transitions in closed systems .",
    "there , a direct crossing of the ground and first excited state energy for finite systems ( mostly arising from a symmetry in the system ) typically gives rise to a first order phase transition .",
