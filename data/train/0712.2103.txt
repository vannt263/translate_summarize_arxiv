    "the `` curvaton '' is an alternative formulation for generating curvature perturbation that does not require fluctuation of the inflaton field@xcite .",
    "the curvaton model has several characteristic features , some of which distinguish curvaton - induced fluctuation from inflaton fluctuation .    in this section we briefly review the calculations related to the lower bound of the inflation scale as derived by lyth in ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a significant relaxation of the bound .",
    "we initially assume that a curvaton ( @xmath4 ) is frozen at @xmath5 during and after inflation . at the beginning of curvaton oscillation ,",
    "the curvaton density is given by @xmath6 . denoting the total density of all other fields by @xmath7 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath8 at the beginning of curvaton oscillation is @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the hubble parameter at the beginning of the oscillation . during the radiation - dominated epoch",
    ", the ratio @xmath8 grows and reaches @xmath11 provided the curvaton potential is dominated by a positive quadratic term .",
    "here , @xmath12 is the temperature for curvaton decay .",
    "the basic concept of the curvaton scenario is that the curvature perturbation @xmath13 is generated by curvaton decay if the curvaton dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "the spectrum of the curvature perturbation related to the curvaton fluctuation is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "since the observational data requires @xmath16 , the curvaton scenario leads to the condition @xmath17 using ( [ rfirst ] ) and ( [ pert1 ] ) , the condition for the cosmological parameters related to the curvaton scenario is given by @xmath18 here , the obvious bound from nucleosynthesis is @xmath19 mev , which gives a bound @xmath20 alternatively , we may use a lower bound for the curvaton decay rate ( @xmath21 ) that leads to the condition @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we obtain an alternative condition @xmath23 the four parameters ( @xmath24 ) that appear in the above calculations give a cosmological boundary condition that characterizes the model . considering both ( [ pert1 ] ) and @xmath25 , we find @xmath26 and then from eq.([ineq1 ] ) and ( [ constraint1 ] ) we find @xmath27 alternatively , eq.([ineq1 ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) give the condition @xmath28 in order to determine a clear bound for the inflation scale ( @xmath15 ) , we need to fix the boundary condition .",
    "we assume that the curvaton mass ( @xmath29 ) is constant during the period that we are interested in .",
    "then , the oscillation of the curvaton field starts when the hubble parameter falls below the curvaton mass ( i.e. , when the hubble parameter reaches @xmath30 ) , which leads to the boundary condition @xmath31 since @xmath32 always holds , we introduce a parameter @xmath33 that measures the ratio between @xmath15 and @xmath10 , defined as @xmath34 . using this new parameter we can replace @xmath10 and @xmath29 in eq.([constraint1a ] ) with @xmath15 and @xmath33 , giving @xmath35 from eq.([constraint2a ] ) we also find @xmath36 note that the bound in eq.([constraint2b ] ) is effective only when @xmath37 , which suggests that a tiny @xmath38 does not simply relax the bound .",
    "therefore , the above conditions lead to a lower bound for the inflation scale ; @xmath39 this result is true for the traditional curvaton that satisfies the above boundary conditions .    to summarize , an alternative ( maybe the curvaton )",
    "is needed for low - scale inflation to avoid problems in the generation of the curvature perturbation , but the bound in eq.([bound - original ] ) suggests that the curvaton paradigm does not accommodate a low inflation scale . for the simplest curvaton",
    ", it is impossible to support low - scale inflation@xcite , even if careful fine - tuning is introduced to the theory .",
    "this is a critical problem for low - scale gravity signals that might be observed in the large hadron collider(lhc ) .",
    "the curvaton could be identified from the brane distance , bulk field or the flat direction of supersymmetric gauge theory , though we will not specify the origin of the curvaton in this paper .",
    "there are many model - dependent discussions for the curvaton hypothesis , but they are beyond the scope of this paper . our goal in this paper is to relax the energy condition of eq.([bound - original ] ) starting with the curvaton hypothesis so that the curvaton treatment can support low - scale inflation .",
    "there are many alternatives generation@xcite or hybrids of these approaches@xcite .",
    "the bound for the curvaton can not be applied to these alternatives . ] that can be applied to this problem .",
    "we believe that it is worthwhile finding the simplest solution to this problem without introducing significant modifications to the traditional curvaton hypothesis .",
    "arguments for the validity of the curvaton hypothesis are highly model - dependent .      in this section",
    "we examine the bound given in eq.([bound - original ] ) if @xmath40 and @xmath4 evolve after inflation but before oscillation begins . following the argument given in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the ratio @xmath41 is almost constant after inflation even if @xmath42 and @xmath4 evolve after inflation .",
    "therefore , for a concave potential @xmath43 , we introduce a parameter @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the time when curvaton oscillation starts and the time when inflation ends , respectively .",
    "is invariant during this evolution , and that the same result applies for the tachyonic evolution ( @xmath48 ) on a convex potential . ]",
    "we can use these relations to evaluate a new energy bound for @xmath49 . using @xmath44 , we find @xmath50 rather than the expression given in ( [ constraint1a ] ) .",
    "we also find @xmath51 rather than ( [ constraint2a ] ) . from these equations and the definition of @xmath33",
    ", we find @xmath52 which is not relaxed by curvaton evolution after inflation if @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , for a concave potential , the bound of the energy scale is not relaxed by curvaton evolution .",
    "this result supports the condition @xmath54 gev given in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was suggested in ref.@xcite that this condition can be relaxed by considering a `` heavy curvaton''@xcite that gives the non - standard boundary condition @xmath55 which is due to a phase transition at the end of inflation .",
    "this new boundary condition significantly alters the bound and gives a milder condition @xmath56 however , this is not sufficient to support the inflation energy scale as low as @xmath57tev .",
    "as we have presented in ref.@xcite , if the phase transition that gives a heavy curvaton occurs later than the primordial inflation , it may lead to another boundary condition that may remove the bound for @xmath15 .",
    "other solutions for this problem have been extensively studied@xcite using other alternative formulations . in this paper",
    "we consider a generic case in which both the coefficient @xmath58 and the sign of the quadratic term depend on the specific conditions of the system .",
    "we show that hilltop curvatons can significantly relax the condition for the inflation scale without introducing additional components or symmetries to the traditional curvaton hypothesis",
    ". evolution of a curvaton on a convex potential that leads to tachyonic enhancement of the fluctuation has already been discussed for a specific model of peccei - quinn field curvatons@xcite . in this model , amplification occurs when the curvaton is stabilized for a period near a maximum of the potential .",
    "although tachyonic amplification with static potential has already been discussed for some specific models , the generality of tachyonic enhancement is unclear for a non - static potential .",
    "we show that a hilltop curvaton , whose mass is not protected from modest @xmath0 corrections , can achieve significant enhancement of the curvaton fluctuation . ) and ( [ non - static ] ) for the difference between tachyonic amplification on static and non - static potentials . ]",
    "( 550,160)(0,0 )    ( 550,160)(0,0 )      we now discuss the enhancement of curvaton fluctuation with a convex potential without introducing additional fine - tuning to the traditional curvaton scenario .",
    "the evolution of the curvaton ( @xmath4 ) and its fluctuation ( @xmath42 ) is given in terms of the effective potential ( @xmath59 ) by the equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath4-derivative of the effective potential , and by the equation @xmath62 here the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath63 . following the original curvaton hypothesis , we consider an effective potential that represents the conventional curvaton potential except for the explicit @xmath0-correction ; @xmath64\\sigma^2 +   \\frac{g}{n!}\\frac{\\sigma^n}{m_*^{n-4}},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is an integer ( @xmath66 ) , and the cut - off scale @xmath67 is supposed to be @xmath68",
    ". can be much smaller than the planck scale . in that case symmetries or mechanisms are required to suppress the coefficients of higher dimensional interactions so that the curvaton potential remains flat .",
    "we follow the original curvaton hypothesis and do not discuss symmetries and mechanisms in this paper since they are highly model - dependent . ]",
    "following the curvaton hypothesis , quartic term of the curvaton potential must be negligible .",
    "the evolution of the curvaton after @xmath69 is precisely the same as the conventional scenario .",
    "evolution before the curvaton oscillation is determined by the @xmath0-correction term ; in our model it leads to tachyonic enhancement .",
    "the sign of the hubble - induced mass term depends on the conditions and must be negative during tachyonic enhancement . for simplicity",
    ", we fix the sign of the hubble - induced mass term to be negative , as this assumption does not reduce the generality of the following argument .",
    "we assume that the expectation value of the curvaton @xmath70 is always smaller than the effective minimum until @xmath29 dominates the curvaton mass .",
    "note that if oscillation occurs about the effective minimum , the curvaton fluctuation is reduced .",
    "then , the evolution of the curvaton during inflation is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 this is the so - called fast - roll evolution@xcite .",
    "comparing ( [ sigma - eq ] ) and ( [ delsig - eq ] ) , it is straightforward to derive the equation for @xmath40 as @xmath73 since the spectrum index of the curvaton perturbation is given by @xmath74 for models with negligible slow - roll parameter @xmath75 , we take the condition - dependent coefficient to be @xmath76 during inflation .",
    "is responsible for the current observational value of the spectral index @xmath65 , the value of @xmath77 during inflation is not determined by @xmath65 . in this case",
    ", there is an upper bound @xmath78 if there is no fine - tuning between @xmath75 and @xmath79 . ] here the definition of the slow - roll parameter @xmath79 is @xmath80 therefore , the exponential factors in the above equations are at most @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the evolution of the curvaton and its fluctuation during inflation is not significant .",
    "the curvaton dynamics after inflation are different from those of the inflationary epoch .",
    "we introduce the barotropic parameter ( @xmath82 ) of the dominant fluid , which does not relate to the curvaton , but instead relates to the background radiation ( @xmath83 for radiation ) or the inflaton oscillation ( for inflaton oscillation @xmath82 depends on the order of the inflaton potential@xcite ) . as we are considering the evolution of the curvaton before the beginning of curvaton oscillation at @xmath84 ,",
    "the dominant part of the effective potential is @xmath85 here , both @xmath1 and @xmath4 depend on the cosmic time @xmath63 , while @xmath77 is a constant determined by the dominant component of the universe .",
    "the value of @xmath77 during inflaton oscillation is believed to be the same as that of the inflationary epoch , while @xmath77 may be different during the radiation - dominated epoch . substituting the @xmath63-derivative by @xmath86 ,",
    "we find@xcite @xmath87 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath88 . solving the above equation for @xmath88 and then substituting @xmath63 , we find@xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is defined as @xmath91 here , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the time at the beginning and end of the evolution , respectively . the evolution of the curvaton and its fluctuation is negligible for @xmath94 , while it is significant for @xmath95 .",
    "since the potential becomes concave near the minimum of the effective potential , we consider the evolution within @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the effective minimum for @xmath98 .",
    "as the time passes , the bare mass ( @xmath29 ) starts to dominate the potential and tachyonic amplification stops at @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "then , the curvaton oscillation starts at @xmath99 , as for a traditional curvaton .",
    "we now consider a concrete example .",
    "we consider a case in which the coefficient of the induced mass is as large as @xmath101 after reheating .",
    "reheating occurs at @xmath102 , then the curvaton oscillation starts at @xmath103 . with this simple and generic situation",
    "we examine the energy condition for the hilltop curvaton .",
    "we introduce a new parameter @xmath104 , which gives the reheating temperature @xmath105 using this parameter , the ratio @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 . considering eq.([enhg1 ] ) and ( [ enhg2 ] ) , we find the enhancement factor @xmath108 for @xmath109 , the enhancement factor @xmath44 is given by @xmath110 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath111 applies because of the relation @xmath112 , where @xmath113 denotes the time when inflation ends .",
    "since ( [ bound - alt ] ) is true for @xmath114 , we find @xmath115 for @xmath101 , @xmath109 and @xmath114 . in this case",
    ", we find @xmath116gev and @xmath117gev .",
    "the required condition for the effective potential is that @xmath118 is smaller than @xmath97 during the tachyonic amplification .",
    "this significant reduction of the inflation energy is a generic consequence of the enhancement of the curvaton fluctuation induced by the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the required condition for this amplification are ( 1 ) if the coefficient of the hubble - induced mass ( @xmath77 ) is somewhat large during the radiation - dominated epoch and ( 2 ) the sign of the mass term is negative , then the curvaton perturbation grows significantly on a convex potential during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "this significant enhancement gives a significant relaxation of the energy condition for the primordial inflation .",
    "we have studied a scenario for hilltop curvatons in which a curvaton evolves on a convex potential .",
    "we assumed that the effective mass of a curvaton is expressed as @xmath2 , where the coefficient varies within @xmath3 depending on the dominant component of the universe .",
    "a negative mass term leads to enhancement of the curvaton fluctuation . in our model , both @xmath40 and the ratio @xmath8 at the beginning of the oscillation are enhanced during this epoch , which has a significant impact on the energy bound for low - scale inflation . following the curvaton hypothesis ,",
    "we have demonstrated the generality of this enhancement .",
    "the hubble - induced mass is necessary for the significant enhancement of the curvaton perturbation in our model .",
    "if there is no @xmath0 correction to the curvaton potential , our scenario requires two different kinds of phase transitions that change the effective mass of the curvaton at least twice .",
    "these phase transitions must occur ( 1 ) between inflation and tachyonic enhancement and ( 2 ) between tachyonic enhancement and curvaton oscillation . moreover ,",
    "tachyonic enhancement with a constant mass is very dangerous for our scenario because a curvaton will soon start to oscillate about the effective minimum . in order to avoid the reduction of @xmath40 during this oscillation",
    ", the second phase transition must take place soon after the first .",
    "the important idea of our scenario is that for a @xmath119 potential , the tachyonic amplification lasts long enough that the conventional curvaton oscillation may start before the beginning of the oscillation about the effective minimum .",
    "in addition to the condition required for the tachyonic enhancement , we must consider the origin of the spectral index @xmath120 .",
    "for the curvaton , this index is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the slow - roll parameter .",
    "in many models of inflation in which @xmath75 is very small , @xmath79 must be responsible for @xmath120 .",
    "however , if there is no mechanism that forces @xmath123 ( i.e. , @xmath124 ) during inflation , it is very difficult to attain the present observational value of the spectral index without introducing fine - tuning .",
    "this may reduce the generality of the curvaton hypothesis , narrowing the range of possible inflation models in which the curvaton can explain the curvature perturbation . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath0 correction is important for the generality of the curvatons , even when tachyonic enhancement does not play an important role .",
    "it should be noted again that the required condition for the curvature perturbation is very severe for low - scale inflation@xcite if it is generated by the inflaton fluctuation .",
    "we wish to thank k.shima for encouragement , and our colleagues at tokyo university for their kind hospitality .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to show how @xmath0 corrections to light scalar fields appear in the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "we will mainly follow the original argument given by dine et.al , in ref.@xcite .",
    "the supergravity scalar potential is given by @xmath125 + v_d,\\ ] ] where @xmath126 and @xmath90 are the superpotential and khler potential , and the derivatives are defined as @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "looking at this scalar potential , there is a @xmath0-correction appears for the soft mass of a light field @xmath4 when the energy density is dominated by @xmath129-terms .",
    "this is the most discussed origin of the @xmath0-corrections .",
    "however in the original argument the origin of such terms is not confined to the scalar potential .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we consider @xmath0 corrections that may appear from nonrenormalizable interactions such as @xmath130 where the scalar component of the superfield @xmath131 is the light field @xmath4 , and @xmath132 is a field that dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "then , the energy density of the universe is given by @xmath133 .",
    "note that in the thermal phase , the expectation value arises from kinetic terms , while the usual @xmath134 correction is significant in a @xmath135-dominated universe . following this argument",
    ", a @xmath0 correction may result even if d - term dominates the potential .    from the above argument it is clear that there is no reason to assume @xmath77 in @xmath136 takes exactly the same value in both the inflation stage and the thermal phase .",
