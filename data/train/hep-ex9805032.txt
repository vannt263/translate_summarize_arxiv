    "the most attractive solution of the strong @xmath0 problem is to introduce the peccei - quinn global symmetry which is spontaneously broken at energy scale @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although the original axion model has been experimentally excluded , variant `` invisible '' axion models are still viable .",
    "such models are referred to as hadronic @xcite and dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitski  @xcite axions . at present , these `` invisible '' axions are constrained by laboratory searches and by astrophysical and cosmological arguments . the well - known window for @xmath1 which escapes all the phenomenological constraints is @xmath2@xmath3gev .",
    "this window is frequently quoted because it is cosmologically interesting .    besides this",
    ", there is another window around @xmath4gev for the hadronic axions .",
    "this is usually called the hadronic axion window . a careful study @xcite of the window revealed that @xmath1 in the range @xmath5@xmath6gev can not be excluded by the existing arguments , because most of them were based on the axion - photon coupling which is the least known parameter among those describing the low energy dynamics of the hadronic axions .",
    "in addition , it is argued that @xmath1 around @xmath4gev is desirable to explain the @xmath7 event in the cdf experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent paper indicates that axion might be a hot dark matter if @xmath8gev @xcite .",
    "although several authors @xcite proposed experiments to search for the axions with @xmath1 around @xmath4gev , all of the experiments clearly rely on the axion - photon coupling both at the source and at the detector .",
    "the methods exploit the primakoff effect ; photons in the sun are converted into axions , which are usually called the solar axions , and they are re - converted into x rays in a laboratory . the experiments to search for",
    "the solar axions by the tokyo group @xcite , by the solax collaboration @xcite , and by a pioneer @xcite rely on the axion - photon coupling .",
    "the experiment @xcite , in which an emission line arising from the radiative decay of axions in the halo of our galaxy is searched for , also proceeded through the axion - photon coupling .",
    "thus there have been no experimental alternatives to test the hadronic axion window without relying on the axion - photon coupling .",
    "this encouraged me to invent a new method to detect axions by exploiting axion - quark couplings , but not by relying on the axion - photon coupling .",
    "because of the axion coupling to nucleons , there is another component of solar axions .",
    "if some nuclides in the sun have @xmath10 transitions and are excited thermally , axion emission from nuclear deexcitation could be also possible .",
    "@xmath9fe can be a suitable axion emitter for the following reasons : ( i ) @xmath9fe has an @xmath10 transition between the first excited state and the ground state , ( ii ) the first excitation energy of @xmath9fe is 14.4kev , which is not too high compared with the temperature in the center of the sun @xmath11 , and ( iii ) @xmath9fe is one of the stable isotopes of iron , which is exceptionally abundant among heavy elements in the sun .",
    "the natural abundance of @xmath9fe is 2.2% .",
    "if the axion exists , therefore , strong emission of axions is expected from this nuclide .",
    "these monochromatic axions would excite the same kind of nuclide in a laboratory because the axions are doppler broadened due to thermal motion of the axion emitter in the sun , and thus some axions have energy suitable to excite the nuclide .",
    "[ fig : principle ] shows the principle of the proposed experiment .",
    "i propose to search for the axions by detecting this excitation . since both the emission and absorption occurs via the axion - nucleon coupling but not via the axion - photon coupling , this method is free from the uncertainty of the axion - photon coupling .",
    "in addition , this method has merits that there is no need to tune the detector to a mass of the axions and that the sensitive mass region can be much higher than that of the proposed experiment @xcite , in which it is restricted by high pressure of buffer gas .",
    "the event rate is calculated in ref .  @xcite . since it depends on a parameter @xmath12 which characterizes the flavor singlet coupling ,",
    "which is not accurately determined , it is plotted as a function of @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : limit ] . in the figure ,",
    "the experimental values of @xmath12 obtained recently @xcite are included .",
    "the most recent experimental result gives @xmath13 and discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate @xmath14 . if the true value of @xmath12 is around 0.4 as suggested , the expected event rate is restricted between 0.1 and 2.5 events kg@xmath15day@xmath15 .",
    "since there are both the upper bound and lower bound of the expected event rate , experiments which have adequate sensitivity will definitely determine whether the axion exists with @xmath1 in the hadronic axion window .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of experimental realities . after the excitation of the nuclei by the axion , there are two possible ways to relax .",
    "one is the emission of a @xmath16 ray with an energy of 14.4kev .",
    "the other is the emission of an internal conversion electron with an energy of 7.3kev and atmic radiations .",
    "since the attenuation length of the @xmath16 ray is @xmath17 m and the range of the electron is @xmath18 m in iron , it is difficult to detect the @xmath16 rays or electrons outside the iron . in addition , detectors should have low energy threshold , low background , and high energy resolution .",
    "however , these difficulties are possibly overcome by using a bolometric technique with an absorber which contains @xmath9fe - enriched iron .",
    "the technique has much advantages compared with other techniques in these respects .",
    "it is generally accepted that a sensitivity down to 0.1 events kg@xmath15day@xmath15 is reachable with a bolometer for dark matter search .",
    "if we can utilize this technique for the proposed experiment , it is possible to obtain a definite result as discussed above .",
    "recently , an experimental result based on this proposal was reported .",
    "krmar  @xcite used a simple method to detect @xmath9fe solar axions .",
    "they put a thin disk made of @xmath9fe in front of a silicon lithium detector .",
    "a disk of natural iron with the same dimensions was used for background measurement . in this situation",
    ", they can detect only gamma rays which escape from the target .",
    "since this is very rare , the total efficiency is extremely low .",
    "their limit is that the axion mass is smaller than 745ev .",
    "although this is far beyond the hadronic axion window , i think this is a very interesting result .",
    "in summary , a new scheme to detect almost monochromatic solar axions using resonant excitation of @xmath9fe is introduced .",
    "@xmath9fe is rich in the sun and its first excitation energy is low enough to be excited thermally .",
    "therefore , one can expect the nuclear deexcitation accompanied with the axion emission .",
    "because of the doppler effect associated with the thermal motion of @xmath9fe in the sun , a small portion of the axions from the nuclide can be absorbed by the same kind of nuclide in a laboratory .",
    "the nuclide is considered as a high sensitive detector of the axions .",
    "the excitation rate is expected to be order of @xmath19 .",
    "although it is difficult to detect the excitation outside the iron , it is detected efficiently by a bolometric technique with an absorber which contains @xmath9fe - enriched iron .",
    "i am planning an experiment to search for the monochromatic axions from the sun in this new scheme .",
    "i want to thank dr .",
