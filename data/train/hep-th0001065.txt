    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) gravity has attracted much attention due to the conjectured correspondence to a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of the ads spacetime @xcite leading to the so - called ads / cft correspondence .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite ) . the ads / cft correspondence has been extended to a dw / qft correspondence @xcite for d@xmath0branes in ten dimensions . in this talk",
    "we extend the discussion of @xcite to general two - block @xmath0branes in various dimensions .    in section 1",
    "we first discuss some general facts on domain - wall and anti - de sitter spacetimes . in section 2",
    "we calculate the near - horizon geometries of a generic @xmath0brane . in section 3",
    "we discuss the field theory limit for the general case .",
    "the formulae we give in this section are applied to the special case of 0branes we discuss in the section 4 . in this final section",
    "we discuss the quantum mechanics of 0branes , or extreme black holes , in various dimensions .",
    "domain - wall ( dw ) spaces , i.e.  spaces of co - dimension 1 , occur as solutions to the equations of motion of a ( super-)gravity action with a dilaton scalar @xmath1 and a ( d-1)form gauge potential ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "they are @xmath0branes with worldvolume dimension @xmath2 which is one less than the dimension @xmath3 of their target spacetime , i.e.  @xmath4 .",
    "the part of the supergravity action needed to describe the dw solution is given by ( we use the einstein frame and mostly plus signature ) : @xmath5\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the gravitational coupling constant with ( ignoring constants ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the dilaton coupling parameter .",
    "we also introduced a parameter @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 solving the equations of motions following from ( [ einstcosm ] ) one finds : @xmath11 with @xmath12 a parameter and where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( which is invariant under dimensional reduction ) are defined by @xmath15 the function @xmath16 is harmonic on the 1-dimensional transverse space with coordinate @xmath17 : @xmath18 with @xmath19 constant .",
    "the domain - wall is positioned at the discontinuity @xmath20 .",
    "different choices of @xmath12 correspond to different choices of coordinates and lead to different expressions for the metric @xcite .",
    "for instance , one can choose @xmath12 such that the powers of the harmonic function become equal or opposite .",
    "shifting the position of the domain wall to infinity , e.g. @xmath21 allows us to discard the constant @xmath22 in the harmonic function and , furthermore there is only one side of the domain wall . we can eliminate @xmath12 if we define a mass parameter @xmath23 by : @xmath24 with @xmath25 . making a co - ordinate transformation and by going to the so - called `` dual frame '' metric @xmath26 , indicated by a subscript star , @xmath27 we find for the solution ( [ domainwall ] ) @xmath28 in the dual frame ( [ reg ] ) the domain - wall solution ( [ dwr ] ) describes an @xmath29 spacetime with a linear dilaton , the latter breaking the full conformal structure of the ads spacetime",
    ". this observation will be the key to generalizing the ads / cft duality to a dw / qft duality .",
    "our starting point is the @xmath3-dimensional action @xmath30\\ , , \\ ] ] which contains three independent parameters : the target spacetime dimension @xmath3 , the dilaton coupling parameter @xmath31 and a parameter @xmath0 specifying the rank @xmath32 of the field strength @xmath33 . the parameter @xmath9 is a generalization of ( [ park ] ) and is given by @xmath34 we have furthermore introduced two useful dependent parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 which are defined by @xmath37 we next consider the following class of diagonal `` two - block '' @xmath0brane solutions ( using the einstein frame ) .",
    "the p - brane solution is _ electrically _ charged with respect to the p+1form potential . ] : @xmath38 where @xmath39 we use a constant , i.e.  metric independent , levi - civita tensor .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a generalization of the @xmath14 in the previous section defined by @xcite @xmath42 which is invariant under reductions and oxidations ( in the einstein frame ) .",
    "the function @xmath16 is harmonic over the @xmath43 transverse coordinates and , assuming that @xmath44 ( i.e. no constant or logarithmic harmonic ) this harmonic function is given by @xmath45 here @xmath46 is an integration constant with the dimensions of length .",
    "it is related to the mass and charge of the @xmath0brane a follows .",
    "the mass @xmath47 per unit p ",
    "volume is given by the adm  formula : @xmath48 on the other hand , the charge @xmath49 per unit p - volume is given , in terms of the same integration constant @xmath46 , by the gauss - law formula @xmath50 hence , the p ",
    "brane solution satifies the bps bound @xmath51 to derive an expression for @xmath46 in terms of the string parameters @xmath13 and @xmath52 , which fixes the scaling of @xmath16 , one must add a source term to the supergravity bulk action . using the no - force condition and the fact that in the string frame the electric ( p+1)form potential @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath54 , as follows from the action ( [ generalaction ] ) , we find that @xmath55 comparing with ( [ taup ] ) and using ( [ kappad ] ) we deduce that , for a single brane , @xmath56    the two - block solutions ( [ 2block ] ) include the ( supersymmetric ) domain - wall spaces of the previous section .",
    "they correspond to the case @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the solutions also include the known branes in ten and eleven dimensions ( m2 , m5 , d@xmath0 , f1 , ns5 etc . ) as well as branes in lower dimensions .",
    "if the branes under consideration preserve any supersymmetries we can set @xcite @xmath60 where generically @xmath61 is the number of unbroken supersymmetries .",
    "we now consider the limit for which the constant part in the harmonic function is negligible . as in the previous section",
    "we make a co - ordinate transformation and go to the dual frame @xmath62 after these manipulations we can write the near - horizon metric as @xmath63 which has an @xmath64 geometry and a linear dilaton .    reducing over the @xmath65 angular variables of the sphere we end up with a gauged supergravity in @xmath66 dimensions of the form ( [ einstcosm ] ) supporting a domain - wall solution of the form ( [ domainwall ] ) . the precise relation between the parameters of the action",
    "( [ einstcosm ] ) and its solution ( [ domainwall ] ) in terms of those of the action ( [ generalaction ] ) and its solution ( [ nhgeometry ] ) can be found in section 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "summarizing , in this section we showed that in the dual frame , defined by ( [ dualframe ] ) , all @xmath0branes solutions ( [ 2block ] ) have a near horizon geometry @xmath67 .",
    "the domain - wall metric has all the isometries of an ads space .",
    "these isometries are broken in the full background because of the presence of a linear dilaton .",
    "in this section we will set up the framework for the dw / qft duality similar to the analysis of @xcite but for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the analysis is similar to the ads / cft duality .",
    "there one finds ( in the low - energy limit ) that supergravity in the near - horizon geometry of a large number of non - dilatonic branes is dual to the conformal field theory living on these branes ( which are located at the boundary of the near - horizon geometry ) .",
    "this so - called holographic principle lies at the heart of the ads / cft conjecture .",
    "as we showed in the previous sections , the near - horizon geometry of a general @xmath0-brane in the dual - frame is equivalent to that of a non - dilatonic @xmath0-brane .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that the duality might be extended .",
    "the presence of the dilaton makes the ads background into a domain - wall background and the conformal field theory into a general quantum field theory , hence the name dw / qft duality . in the following",
    "we will only consider d - branes and their intersections in lower dimensions .",
    "one starts with a d@xmath0-brane configuration in string theory and takes the low - energy limit in which only the massless modes survive and in which the theories in the bulk and on the brane decouple .",
    "next , one introduces a new energy - scale and a dimensionless coupling constant which are the free parameters of the decoupled theories .",
    "the energy - scale can be given in several ways :    [ probes ]    if one probes the stacked branes by another d@xmath0-brane , a natural energy - scale is given by the mass of the endpoint of a stretched string , which acts like a w  boson ( see figure 1 ) @xmath68 this was the approach taken by @xcite , all branes have the same energy - scale but the disadvantage is that the near - horizon geometry when written in the @xmath69 co - ordinates does not take the same form for all branes .",
    "one can also probe the branes by a supergravity field @xmath70 ( suppressing possible quantum numbers ) . by solving the wave equation for this field @xcite",
    "one finds the following energy scale @xmath71 in @xcite it was shown that this energy - scale corresponds to the so - called holographic energy - scale used in entropy calculations .",
    "although the energy depends on the parameters of the brane solution , one finds that the near - horizon geometry ( [ dwr ] ) in these holographic @xmath72 co - ordinates is particularly simple : @xmath73\\ , .\\ ] ] for all branes this metric has the form @xmath74 differing only in the ( relative ) radii of the sphere and anti - de - sitter space .",
    "the quantum field theory on the brane is in general not explicitly known , but dimensional analysis enables us to extract some information .",
    "if we assume that the theory is given by some @xmath75-form potential on the @xmath76 dimensional worldvolume @xmath77 then we have for the coupling constant scaling behavior @xmath78 for 10-dimensional d@xmath0-branes we have a vector - multiplet ( i.e.  @xmath79 ) on the worldvolume reproducing the familiar @xmath80 scaling behavior for the yang - mills theory on the d@xmath0-brane worldvolume .",
    "the effective dimensionless coupling constant @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 since we have two different probes , we can in principle construct two different dimensionless couplings , constructed by either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . since both probes have a sensible interpretation , it must be possible to use them both , independently of the low - energy limit .",
    "this leads to the following constraint on the scaling behavior in terms of the brane - solution parameters @xcite : @xmath85 combining this with the definitions of the probe - scales @xmath86 and @xmath84 we find the following relations between them and their corresponding dimensionless couplings @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 the decoupling limit is now given by @xmath90 the dimensionless coupling made from newton s constant in this limit becomes @xmath91 so that if @xmath92 becomes too large one has to take @xmath93 to infinity to ensure the decoupling of gravity .    in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence one has in the field theory side the parameters @xmath94 which correspond to the curvature and string coupling on the supergravity side .",
    "they generalize to the effective tension of a string in the dual frame and the dilaton , respectively : @xmath95 we now have the following ranges of validity on the two sides of the duality    * perturbative sym : @xmath96 * classical sugra : @xmath97    using the above formulae one can easily see that classical supergravity describes strongly coupled , large n field theory .",
    "however , the conformal invariance which in the ads / cft duality facilitates computations in the strongly coupled field theory is now broken so that any direct check of a dw / qft duality is ruled out . for specific examples ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .    as long as @xmath98 is positive , the supergravity and field theory are valid in different regimes ( i.e.  @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) and one can find consistent phase diagrams as in @xcite .",
    "however , for negative @xmath98 , e.g.  in case of the d6-brane , this seems no longer true at first sight : @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "as one can see by using the relation ( [ proberel ] ) between the two couplings , this corresponds to @xmath102 and @xmath100 .",
    "this matches nicely with the explanation of @xcite , namely that the low - energy hilbert space of the field theory has two separate sectors : one describing nearby ( in u co - ordinates ) brane probes and one describing supergravity probes far away ( also in u co - ordinates ) from the brane .",
    "finally we note that when the dilaton becomes larger one can perform an s - duality transformation .",
    "if the curvature is small with respect to the s - dual string scale , then one can still trust the supergravity approximation .",
    "in this section we consider the special case of 0branes in various dimensions .",
    "the ( bosonic ) lagrangian for a particle with mass @xmath23 and charge @xmath75 , moving in the string frame near - horizon background of @xmath93 stacked 0branes reads @xmath103 where the dot represents derivatives with respect to the worldline time .",
    "the d - dimensional 0brane solution in the dual frame @xmath104 is given by the expression ( [ limitsol ] ) , taken for @xmath105 .",
    "introducing the canonical momentum @xmath106 one can write down the mass - shell constraint in the string frame for the probe particle as @xmath107    we would like to solve this equation for @xmath108 .",
    "for this purpose , we transform the mass - shell equation ( [ mass - shell ] ) to the dual frame and substitute the metric and gauge field of the solution ( [ limitsol ] ) . for the gauge field ( being in the temporal gauge ) we can write : @xmath109 and we find for the hamiltonian @xmath110 we can write this hamiltonian in a rather suggestive form by making the following transformation @xmath111 after which the hamiltonian takes on the following form @xmath112 the dynamics of the system is now generated by the poisson brackets with respect to the canonical co - ordinate and momentum @xmath113 . the transition to quantum mechanics",
    "is the usual one . defining two other operators",
    "@xmath114 we find that the system possesses a classical @xmath115-symmetry @xmath116 this is only true when the effective coupling constant @xmath88 of the model under consideration is fixed under scale transformations .",
    "whenever we have a non - trivial dilaton the model will not be conformally invariant by itself .",
    "only when introducing a transformation to keep @xmath88 fixed under conformal transformations , will the model be invariant under what are called generalized conformal transformations @xcite .    taking the limit @xmath117 and at the same time @xmath118 @xcite",
    "we find a `` non - relativistic '' hamiltonian of the form : @xmath119 this model , as first considered in @xcite , is in fact an integrable model so that it might offer a concrete test of the @xmath120 duality in this particular limit .",
