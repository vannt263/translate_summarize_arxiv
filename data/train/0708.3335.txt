    "there are two popular phenomenological scenarios explaining confinement in lattice gluodynamics , monopole condensation  @xcite and the center vortex  @xcite mechanism .",
    "the basic ideas of both scenarios go back to t hooft  @xcite .",
    "both have been recently discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for our discussion ,",
    "monopoles and center vortices are defined by projection to abelian @xmath1 or @xmath2 gauge fields , respectively . in order to distinguish them from extended vortices , these @xmath2 center vortices",
    "are called p - vortices .",
    "the two types of excitations , when derived from the maximally abelian gauge ( mag ) or from the maximal center gauge ( mcg ) , respectively , reproduce about 90%  @xcite and about 70%  @xcite of the non - abelian string tension .",
    "this observation is called monopole and center dominance .",
    "the monopole dominance should not be confused with abelian dominance , which describes the fact that the projected degrees of freedom ( the @xmath1 valued links ) reproduce the original string tension equally well . without gauge fixing the full static potential",
    "is reproduced by abelian projected or center projected links  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the topological excitations and of the corresponding mag or mcg fixing , rests more on the physical reality of the excitations as the possibly relevant infrared degrees of freedom than on the monopole or p - vortex dominance .",
    "the reality is witnessed by their localization and the local excess of action and topological charge carried by monopoles and p - vortices .",
    "the infrared degrees of freedom could be used to derive effective theories to describe the infrared physics , for instance the dual ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite .",
    "this letter elaborates on some other aspects of the physical reality of monopoles and p - vortices .",
    "it turns out that they are constitutive also for other nonperturbative features besides confinement .",
    "removing monopole degrees of freedom  @xcite or p - vortices  @xcite from the ( lattice ) fields should leave only inert and topologically trivial gauge field configurations .    for the issue of physical reality",
    "the conjecture  @xcite was very important that monopoles and p - vortices are geometrically interrelated .",
    "indeed , this was found to be the case in @xmath3 gluodynamics .",
    "more than 90% of monopole currents are localized on the p - vortices  @xcite .",
    "the effect of eliminating one or the other , however , is more complicated and obviously destroys this geometrical interrelation .",
    "it was realized that the removal of monopoles destroys only large ( infrared ) p - vortex clusters whereas the total density of p - vortex plaquettes is suppressed by less than an order of magnitude  @xcite . in the case of removal of vortices the total density of monopole links",
    "is even increased compared to the initial equilibrium configurations  @xcite . in that paper",
    "we have confirmed ( for a finite temperature @xmath4 in the confinement phase ) that for the manipulated lattice ensembles confinement is missing . in particular , we were able to point out why the apparently percolating clusters of monopoles remaining after vortex removal can not produce confinement .",
    "after this observation it is impossible to directly infer confinement from the existence of percolating monopoles .    in the present paper we turn our attention to the topological and chiral aspects of monopoles and vortices . the first new element in comparison with all previous studies of monopole removal and",
    "all but one paper on vortex removal is that we use chirally perfect overlap fermions  @xcite as a probe to confirm the loss of topological charge and the vanishing of the quark condensate in the modified ensembles obtained by monopole or vortex removal .",
    "the other new feature is that for the first time we employ an improved lattice gauge action in this kind of studies .",
    "for all 50 configurations in the original and the modified ensembles we have determined 20 ( in modulus ) lowest eigenvalues @xmath5 and the corresponding eigenmodes ( not used here ) of the massless neuberger overlap dirac operator . to identify the topological charge we refer to the index of this dirac operator .",
    "this is complemented by an improved gluonic expression for the topological density , leading to the same conclusion .",
    "we notice that the gluonic measurement of the topological charge requires a certain amount of ape smearing .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to investigate in what respect the modified ensembles differ from the original monte carlo one with respect to moderate smearing .",
    "for this part of our study an enlarged ensemble of 100 configurations has been used .    in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we give necessary information about the lattice ensembles that we have used . in section [ sec : spectrum ] the effect of the removal of monopole , photon and vortex degrees of freedom on the spectrum close to @xmath6 and on the topological charge is described . in section [ sec : smearing ] we describe the behavior under smearing - concerning the measured monopole , vortex and topological content - which is strikingly different between the equilibrium ensemble and the modified ensembles with monopoles and vortices removed .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions . in the appendix",
    "all necessary definitions are collected .",
    "in two previous papers  @xcite we have applied the overlap dirac operator for @xmath3 lattice gauge theory in conjunction with the tree - level tadpole - improved symanzik action .",
    "this will be the setup also here .",
    "the overlap construction  @xcite provides a perfectly chiral description for lattice fermions .",
    "the choice of action is motivated as follows . in our first paper",
    "@xcite we have applied the overlap dirac operator for a very specific investigation , to find evidence for a partially dyonic , partially caloronic structure of the topological charge distribution at @xmath7 . for this purpose",
    "it was essential to make sure that the configurations are smooth enough such that the number of zero modes and the gross structure of the spectrum of lowest overlap dirac eigenvalues are robust with respect to a change of temporal boundary conditions and with respect to smearing .",
    "this would not be the case for the wilson action .",
    "for the tree - level tadpole - improved symanzik at high enough @xmath8 this requirement is fulfilled .",
    "this has determined us to work on a @xmath9 lattice in the paper  @xcite where @xmath10 has been found to be the deconfinement critical point . in a second paper",
    "@xcite we have extended our investigation with this action to temperatures @xmath11 below @xmath12 and and up to @xmath13 . here",
    "our focus was the dependence of the spectral density and the localization behavior of the eigenmodes on the sign of the spatially averaged polyakov loop @xmath14 as soon as it ceases to vanish in the deconfined phase . in this paper it has been found that a gap opens in the spectral density for @xmath15 , but only for configurations with a positive spatially averaged polyakov loop , @xmath16 , in agreement with predictions by stephanov  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these two papers for details concerning the action and the implementation of the overlap dirac operator . for the present investigation we have chosen the same lattice size @xmath9 and the same action .",
    "we work at @xmath10 .",
    "there is no need to compare different boundary conditions . now",
    "the overlap dirac operator is uniquely endowed with antiperiodic boundary conditions in the temporal and periodic ones in the spatial directions .",
    "we have extended the ensemble to 50 configurations , that was begun with 20 configurations for ref .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath17 of the improved neuberger operator  @xcite are obtained by stereographic projection from @xmath5 situated on the ginsparg - wilson circle onto the imaginary axis , such that in the following the eigenvalues are understood as @xmath18 .",
    "since we have chosen to work at the deconfinement temperature , it makes no sense to discuss here once more the influence of the removal of monopoles or vortices on the string tension  @xcite .",
    "we are concentrating here on the effect of monopoles and vortices on the topological charge @xmath19 via the atiyah - singer index theorem  @xcite , @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 the number of zero modes of positive and negative chirality , and the spectral density @xmath23 near @xmath24 , which is related via the banks - casher relation  @xcite @xmath25 ( with the four - volume @xmath26 ) to the quark condensate .",
    "whenever more than one zero mode is found for one configuration , the chirality of all of them is found to be the same .    for the ensemble of configurations at @xmath7 in ref .",
    "@xcite the gross spectral density was seen to be independent of the boundary condition which means that it is insensitive also to the sign of the ( very small ) average polyakov loop in our ensemble .",
    "this makes it possible to study the non - trivial effect of monopole or vortex removal on the spectral density in an unambiguous way .",
    "the monopole line density  @xcite and the p - vortex plaquette density referred to later are defined in units of the lattice spacing as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of dual links carrying non - vanishing monopole currents for an abelian projected gauge field obtained from the mag .",
    "@xmath29 is the number of dual plaquettes belonging to the total p - vortex area after applying the center projection to the gauge field put into the direct maximal center gauge ( dmcg )  @xcite .",
    "more about these definitions and the procedures that lead to the detection and removal of monopoles and vortices can be found in the appendix .",
    "the following results concerning the density of monopoles and vortices and the investigation of the behavior under smearing in section [ sec : smearing ] are based on an ensemble of 100 configurations .    at @xmath7 , for our equilibrium configurations the vortex density is found to be @xmath30 . with the zero - temperature string tension @xmath31 setting the scale , this corresponds to @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "this number is essentially smaller than the zero temperature density found with the wilson action to be about @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we think that this large difference is mostly due to difference in actions used in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper rather than due to finite temperature effects , i.e. it indicates that the vortex density with improved action is substanially smaller than with wilson action .",
    "the monopole density in the equilibrium ensemble amounts to @xmath35 , that means @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "for comparison , we recall an estimate  @xcite of the monopole density at @xmath38 for @xmath39 and the same action : @xmath40 .",
    "that means that the monopole density is only insignificantly suppressed at @xmath41 compared to @xmath38 .",
    "these densities have to be taken with a grain of salt because it is known that they should be decomposed in an infrared and an ultraviolet part .",
    "the presence of both components becomes obvious in studies of universality  @xcite where only the infrared part possesses a finite continuum limit that can be compared between different actions .",
    "this problem will show up in the process of smearing discussed in section  [ sec : smearing ] .    the topological susceptibility of the equilibrium ensemble defined by @xmath42 translates to @xmath43 or , assuming @xmath44 , to @xmath45 .",
    "this is in the right ballpark for the ( unsuppressed ) topological susceptibility .",
    "once monopole or vortex degrees of freedom are removed from the configurations the fermionic ( overlap ) topological charge is stricly vanishing .",
    "it might come unexpectedly , that @xmath46 is not preserved if the regular ( photon ) degrees of freedom are removed from the configurations .",
    "we will point out later that in this case also the opposite ( vanishing topological charge ) could have been expected .",
    "for this modified ensemble @xmath47 has been measured .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the disappearance of the quark condensate and the complete loss of topological charge in modified ensembles of configurations having monopoles or vortices removed .",
    "we emphasize that this effect has been partly studied already  @xcite , for either monopoles or vortices removed , with various gauge actions and fermionic actions ( staggered , chirally improved ) for the confinement phase .",
    "thus , the results of this section are a confirmation of the crucial role of monopole and vortex degrees of freedom for the spectral properties obtained with a new , more convincing tool - the overlap dirac operator .",
    "let us note that results obtained at the edge of the confining phase of quenched @xmath3 gluodynamics are not less interesting .",
    "at this temperature the topological susceptibility is still approximately the same as for @xmath38 , and the spectral gap is not yet opened  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullphotmonvor ] we illustrate this by one configuration .",
    "the panel on the extreme right shows the spectrum of low lying modes of overlap fermions after removing the vortex degrees of freedom .",
    "this should be compared with the original spectrum shown on the extreme left .",
    "the originally existent zero mode has disappeared , and the non - zero modes have moved outward . a similar change of the spectrum can be observed on the middle right panel after removing the monopole degrees of freedom from the same configuration .     +    in the middle left panel the effect of removing the regular ( photon ) part from the abelian projected field is shown .",
    "this spectrum differs only in minor details from the original spectrum but the number of zero modes and the interval covered by the 20 modes remained unaffected .",
    "we have to stress that the number of zero modes is not always stable with respect to the removal of the regular part of the abelian field .",
    "the latter comparison enforces the conclusion that , from the point of view of abelian projection , the decisive role for chiral symmetry breaking is played by the monopole part of the abelian projected field , whereas the topological charge is not robust against the reduction of the abelian field to its singular ( monopole ) part .    ) for the four ensembles of 50 lattice configurations : ( a ) the original equilibrium configurations ( solid line ) and the configurations with removed photons ( dashed line ) ( b ) the configurations with removed monopoles ( solid line ) and with removed vortices ( dashed line).,title=\"fig : \" ] ) for the four ensembles of 50 lattice configurations : ( a ) the original equilibrium configurations ( solid line ) and the configurations with removed photons ( dashed line ) ( b ) the configurations with removed monopoles ( solid line ) and with removed vortices ( dashed line).,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( a ) ( b ) +    in fig .",

    "this effect is stronger if vortices are removed , less if monopoles are removed .",
    "the appearance of the gap among the near - zero modes signals the vanishing of the quark condensate which is still non - vanishing at the given temperature for the original ensemble ( top left ) and after the removal of the photon degrees of freedom ( top right ) .",
    "notice that in all configurations the zero modes are neither completely preserved nor completely destroyed when the photon degrees of freedom are suppressed .",

    "this finding might be difficult to reconcile with the notion of abelian dominance of the topological charge  @xcite .",
    "strict abelian dominance of the latter would imply that after the removal of the regular `` photon '' part of the abelian projected gauge field no topological charge should be left at all .",
    "these considerations were refering , however , to cooled configurations and the ground state whereas we consider here unsmeared configurations at non - zero temperature .",
    "we can describe the interrelation between monopoles and p - vortices by the effect of removing one type of infrared degrees of freedom on the density of the other .",
    "we should emphasize again that the density alone does not decide about the confining property of the ensemble  @xcite .",
    "here we are asking whether smearing is able to reveal that a lattice ensemble is corrupted in an essential way by the removal of monopoles or vortices . in the confinement phase",
    "`` corrupted '' means that it is unable to confine .",
    "we answer this question affirmatively without reference to the string tension showing that the density of complementary objects and the topological susceptibility disappear under smearing .",
    "we have seen already that the effect of vortex or monopole removal on the chirally perfect dirac spectrum shows up without smearing .",
    "this does not change afterwards under the influence of smearing .",

    "the monopole density @xmath52 is approximately doubled to @xmath53 .",
    "the abundant monopole lines form clusters that still contain a percolating component , but the non - abelian string tension vanishes as it should  @xcite .",
    "also the monopole string tension vanishes  @xcite in agreement with expectations .",
    "the unphysical ( inert ) character of magnetic monopoles in the configurations modified by vortex removal was thoroughly discussed in  @xcite .",

    "this effect of smearing reflects mainly the elimination of ultraviolet monopole objects .",

    "[ fig : smeartopcharge ] the effect of vortex removal on the topological susceptibility as determined by the gluonic topological density is also shown by a dotted line as function of the smearing steps .",

    "in this letter , in order to clarify the role of certain @xmath3 gauge field excitations for the topological and chiral properties of the quenched ensemble of lattice fields , we have reconsidered the properties of the configurations at the deconfinement temperature @xmath7 after removing two typical non - perturbative degrees of freedom .",
    "the condensation of the corresponding gauge field fluctuations , abelian monopoles and center vortices ( more precisely , p - vortices ) , is popularly held responsible for quark confinement at lower temperature . for our purpose",
    "we have applied special techniques of removal in order to study the effect on the complementary type of fluctuations and on the build - up of a topological charge and for the existence of a quark condensate .",
    "we confirm that for overlap quarks and also at the deconfinement temperature the suppression of each of these non - perturbative degrees of freedom leads to a loss of the complementary type of fluctuations , of topological charge and chiral quark condensate .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for the loss of p - vortex density in the result of monopole suppression which might mean that the vortices , ceasing to percolate spatially at the deconfining temperature , become also decorrelated from the monopoles in the sense that they can exist also without monopoles .",
    "the converse is not true .",
    "the strength of this correlation is made visible by applying smearing .    concerning the topological charge of a configuration we have the choice between an ( improved ) gluonic definition of @xmath60 and the index of the overlap dirac operator .",
    "while the fermionic topological charge @xmath46 is immediately destroyed by removing monopoles or vortices , the gluonic topological susceptibility , in the absence of a true topological charge representing the additive renormalization for the topological susceptibility , rapidly drops to zero within a few smearing steps . for the unmodified ensemble , the actual topological charge @xmath46 ( equal to plus or minus the number of zero modes ) is insensitive with respect to smearing  @xcite even for more smearing steps than considered in this paper .",
    "this smearing usually makes visible extended topological background excitations , as for example calorons or bps monopoles ( dyons ) .",
    "these are suppressed as soon as abelian monopoles or p - vortices are removed from the configurations such that no smearing can make them reappearing .",
