    "<S> a model for growing networks is introduced , having as a main ingredient that new nodes are attached to the network through one existing node and then explore the network through the links of the visited nodes . from exact calculations of two limiting cases and numerical simulations the phase diagram of the model is obtained . in the stationary limit , large network sizes , a phase transition from a network with finite average connectivity to a network with a power law distribution of connectivities , with no finite average , is found . </S>",
    "<S> results are compared with measurements on real networks .    2    </S>",
    "<S> a network is composed by a set of nodes and a set of links among then . </S>",
    "<S> the topological properties of disordered networks have been studied for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> a well known example is the work of erdos and rnyi @xcite where a network generated by placing links among the nodes at random is studied . </S>",
    "<S> however such a model is not able to describe the topological properties of real complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> the main current studies are thus focused in finding the mechanism which generates such networks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> watts and strogatz @xcite introduced the `` small - world '' network model , an interpolation between regular lattices and random graphs . </S>",
    "<S> different social , biological and economic networks has been found to be well described by such approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a model is more appropriate for networks where the number of nodes remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it yields a distribution of connectivities @xmath0 peaked around a characteristic value @xcite .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> some authors have studied the topological properties of networks generated by evolutionary dynamics @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the network topology is changed using extremal dynamics rules inspired in the bak - sneppen model for biological evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a model with fixed @xcite and variable @xcite number of nodes has been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the topological properties of the second model reveals that the distribution of connectivities changes in time , yielding either exponential or power law distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , there is a class of growing - network models where the addition of new nodes leads to scale - free structures @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the connectivity distribution follows a power law decay @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> examples are the world wide web ( www ) where html documents are the nodes and the links to other documents in the www are the links @xcite ; and the citation of scientific publications where papers are the node and citations among them are the links @xcite . in these two examples </S>",
    "<S> the number of nodes ( html documents or papers ) is clearly increasing in time . here </S>",
    "<S> the attention is focused in this class of networks .    </S>",
    "<S> different points of view appear when describing the evolution in time of the set of links , which is actually the mechanism introducing randomness in scale - free models . in the approach by huberman and adamic </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the number of links pointing to a node is a random fraction of the number of links which are already pointing to that node . on the other hand , barabsi and albert @xcite have proposed a preferential attachment , where new nodes are linked with higher probability to those existing nodes with have higher connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been recently shown to be a particular case of a model proposed by simon in the fifties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the study of this class of growing networks is currently very active and new variants have been proposed @xcite , keeping the preferential attachment as main ingredient .    </S>",
    "<S> however , these growing - network models do not take into account one fundamental property of real networks , the fact that a new node does not have `` knowledge '' of the entire network . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , when a scientist is writing a manuscript he does not know all the already published papers which may have certain relation with the subject he is dealing with . </S>",
    "<S> in fact he only knows a few number of papers and through the references appearing on them he found new ones , and continues his search recursively using the new references on them . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the model introduced in this paper is based on the fact that we know the network , or at least part of it , by `` walking '' on it . </S>",
    "<S> this feature together with growing yield the scaling behavior observed in real growing networks .    </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined by giving an initial condition and a set of evolution rules . _ </S>",
    "<S> initial condition _ : one starts with one node @xmath3 and an empty set of links . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution rules are divided in _ adding _ a node and _ walking _ through the network . </S>",
    "<S> _ adding _ : a new node @xmath4 is created with a link to one existing node selected at random . _ </S>",
    "<S> walking _ : the new node `` walks '' through all the nodes pointed by the selected node and create a link to them with a probability @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this last rule is repeated recursively with the new selected links . when no new link is created </S>",
    "<S> add a new node .    </S>",
    "<S> one run of this algorithm for @xmath6 and up to @xmath7 nodes is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 : a node is created ( node 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 : a second node ( node 2 ) is created which can only point to node 1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 : node 3 is created and it can point either to node 1 or 2 . in the particular case shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] it points to node 1 . since node 1 does </S>",
    "<S> not has any link the rule stops . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 : node 4 is created which can point to either node 1,2 and 3 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it points to node 2 . </S>",
    "<S> now node 2 has a link to node 1 so with probability @xmath5 node 4 creates a link to node 1 ( it is not created in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 : node 5 is created which can point to either node 1,2,3 and 4 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it points to node 4 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath11 has a link to node 2 node 5 will create a link to node 2 with probability @xmath5 ( it is created in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> but now node 2 has a link to node 1 so with probability @xmath5 node 5 creates a link to node 1 ( it is not created in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> and so on .    </S>",
    "<S> the main assumptions of this model is that one has the first contact with the network through one node and then explores the rest of by `` walking '' through the directed links . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is a time scale separation between the addition of nodes and the mechanism of creation of new links . </S>",
    "<S> the network is clearly a directed graph and between two nodes there can be only one link , which goes from one to the other . </S>",
    "<S> the only parameter of the model is @xmath5 which may have different interpretations according to the particular problem one is modeling . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the problem of citations @xmath5 is the fraction of papers appearing in the list of references of one paper which may be of our interest .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now investigate the evolution of the connectivity distribution as @xmath12 grows . here </S>",
    "<S> the connectivity is defined as the number of links pointing to a node ( in - degree ) . </S>",
    "<S> when a new node is added to the network the connectivity of any node already at the network remains constant or increases by one . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , from @xmath9 to 4 the connectivity of node 2 increases by one while that of the other nodes remain constant . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the created node has connectivity @xmath13    let @xmath14 be the probability that when adding the @xmath4 node the connectivity of a node with connectivity @xmath15 increases by one . with this definition , </S>",
    "<S> the number of nodes @xmath16 with connectivity @xmath15 evolves according to the set of equations @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18    for @xmath19 one can look for stationary solutions of this set equations . </S>",
    "<S> in this limit @xmath14 should be of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 comes from the fact that the new node is attached to an existing node selected at random , which happens with probability @xmath21 ( this will be demonstrated below for two limiting cases ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , taking into account that @xmath22 and the stationary condition @xmath23 one obtains @xmath24 @xmath25,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{for}\\ k>0 . \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] thus , determining @xmath26 one can iterate ( [ eq:3 ] ) to obtain the stationary distribution @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> a node with connectivity @xmath13 can only increase its connectivity if the new node is attached to it , which happens with probability @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath27 and , therefore , @xmath28 . from this result and ( [ eq:4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is independent of the value of @xmath5 , i.e. in the present model half of the nodes have no links pointing to them .    </S>",
    "<S> the form of @xmath14 for @xmath30 is not known . here </S>",
    "<S> only the limiting cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 are solved exactly . for @xmath31 , independent of the connectivity of a node , </S>",
    "<S> the probability that its connectivity increases by one is @xmath33 , which is just the probability that the new node is attached to it . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath34 independent of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> substituting this result in ( [ eq:3 ] ) and iterating with the initial condition @xmath29 it results that @xmath35 in the other limit , @xmath32 , a node will increase its connectivity either if the new node is attached to it or to one of the nodes with a link to it , i.e. @xmath36 . in this case after iteration of ( [ eq:3 ] ) one obtains @xmath37^{-1},\\ \\ \\ \\ </S>",
    "<S> \\text{for}\\ p=1 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ]    notice that for @xmath32 since @xmath36 there is a preferential attachment to nodes with larger connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the main ingredients introduced by barabsi and albert to obtain the desired emergence of scaling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> actually in their model @xmath14 is also linear in @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the preferential attachment is imposed while here , on the contrary , it appears self - consistently from the dynamics of the network . the evolution rules of the model do not show us _ a priori _ the existence of a preferential attachment but it is clear that nodes with larger connectivity becomes more visible when one `` walks '' through the network .    </S>",
    "<S> these limiting cases are described by distributions which are qualitative different . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath31 the distribution is exponential with a finite average connectivity . on the contrary for @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is the power law decay @xmath39 for large @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this power law decay goes up to the largest possible connectivity @xmath40 while @xmath41 for @xmath42 . then for large @xmath12 the average connectivity scale as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is independent of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the average connectivity thus diverges when @xmath45 .    since the limiting cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 give qualitative different behaviors there should be certain probability threshold @xmath46 where a transition from a network with finite average connectivity to a free - scale network takes place . in the absence of analytical results for @xmath47 numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> are performed in order to explore this part of the phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> the maximum network size reached was 81920 nodes and average was taken over 100 runs of the algorithm which generates the network , for each value of @xmath5 reported here . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting connectivity distribution is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . the first thing to be </S>",
    "<S> notice is that the analytical results in ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) for the limiting cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , are in very good agreement with the numerical data . </S>",
    "<S> second , the transition from a finite average distribution to a power law takes place at an intermediate probability @xmath48 , where @xmath46 is in the neighborhood of @xmath49 .    to obtain a more precise estimate of the threshold </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the average connectivity @xmath50 with @xmath12 was investigated . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath51 it was found to saturate to a finite value when @xmath19 while for @xmath52 it grows logarithmically with @xmath12 as in the limiting case @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath53 and @xmath54 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in the neighborhood of the threshold the network sizes needed to reach the stationary state are not accessible by the present numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the following approximate method was used to determine @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical data was fitted by the parabola @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are fitting parameters . for @xmath52 the parameter @xmath59 is expected to be zero while for @xmath51 it is negative , as a consequence of the tendency of @xmath60 to saturates to the stationary value . actually due to numerical errors </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 will never be exactly zero . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 is estimated by the value of @xmath5 at which @xmath59 changes sign , becoming either zero or positive . using this criteria </S>",
    "<S> it results that @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now focus our attention in the form of @xmath0 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] it can be seen that for @xmath51 the shape of the connectivity distribution depends on @xmath5 . for @xmath52 , although there are some deviations for @xmath15 small , the large @xmath15 behavior is characterized by the power law decay @xmath1 with an exponent @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , above the threshold , the connectivity distribution of the network is very robust , showing little variations when @xmath5 changes .    </S>",
    "<S> these features are very similar to those observed in some sandpile models @xcite , the paradigm of the theory of self - organized criticality @xcite . as in these models , there is a time scale separation , here between the addition of new nodes and their `` walk '' through the network . in the thermodynamic limit , </S>",
    "<S> large system sizes , the phase diagram of the model is divided in a sub - critical and a critical region , and in the critical region the power law exponent does not depend on the control parameter . </S>",
    "<S> all these similarities put these models in the same class , with a self - organized critical region in the phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> there are real complex networks which can be described by the present model . </S>",
    "<S> the network of citations among papers published in journals is an example . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the number of times a paper is cited in other papers . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the available data yield the power law exponent @xmath63 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value is larger that the universal value @xmath64 observed in the critical region of the model introduced here . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems that citation problem is in some part of the sub - critical region below @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> actually the fraction of papers one usually considers , to be referred in a future publication , is small in comparison with the total amount of referenced papers appearing in papers of our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> however , more data is needed to reach to a final conclusion .    in the www network html documents are the nodes , the links to other documents in the www are the links , and @xmath15 is the number of times a html document appears as a link in other html documents . in html </S>",
    "<S> documents the links are created when the html document is created but can also be changed latter on . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the addition of new nodes is not the only mechanism of changing the set of links . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rate of addition of new html documents is actually very high so one expect that the addition of new documents is the dominant mechanism and , therefore , can be described by the present model . </S>",
    "<S> measurements reported in the literature @xcite yield the exponent @xmath65 in very good agreement with the exponent @xmath64 in the critical region . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the www network is in some part of the critical region .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , with only one control parameter the present model is able to describe the form of the connectivity distribution of networks with different topologies . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath66 it describes networks with a finite average connectivity , which may have a power law decay for small connectivities but with a cutoff independent of the network size for large connectivities . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath67 it describes networks with power law distribution of connectivities , up to a cutoff determined by the network size . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from one behavior to the other is determined by the parameter @xmath5 , which measures the probability to create a new link and continue the search in the network through the added link . </S>"
