    "the period - luminosity ( pl , also known as the leavitt law ) relation of cepheid variables is an important relation for determining extra - galactic distances .",
    "previous research has focused on the pl relation of cepheids in the optical and near infrared @xmath9 bands , with only recent emphasis on the mid - infrared .",
    "similar to the advantages of @xmath9 pl relations ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mid - infrared pl relations are important because : ( i ) they are less susceptible to extinction ; ( ii ) they are expected to have a smaller amplitude and therefore magnitudes can be determined using a smaller number of observations ; ( iii ) they may not be sensitive to metallicity @xcite ; and ( iv ) they have a smaller dispersion as compared to optical pl relations . previous work on the mid - infrared pl relations , based on _ spitzer _ data , has concentrated on the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheids @xcite , the small magellanic cloud ( smc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galactic cepheids @xcite .",
    "in addition to _ spitzer _ , data taken from the infrared camera ( irc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on - board the _ akari _ satellite @xcite can also be used to derive the mid - infrared pl relations , providing an independent cross check to _ spitzer _ results .",
    "this has been done for the lmc cepheids as presented in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . in this paper , we continue our investigation of the mid - infrared pl relation using _ akari _ data for the smc cepheids .",
    "since extinction is negligible in the mid - ir bands , this paper does not take extinction into account .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the _ akari _ data used in this work is based on the smc bright point sources catalog presented in @xcite .",
    "photometry in @xmath10 ( @xmath1 , @xmath11 sources ) , @xmath12 ( @xmath2 , @xmath13 sources ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath3 , @xmath15 sources ) , @xmath16 ( @xmath4 , @xmath17 sources ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath5 , @xmath19 sources ) , and @xmath20 ( @xmath6 , @xmath21 sources ) @xmath22 bands provided from the _ akari _ catalog , along with the the time of observation , is on the irc - vega magnitude system as defined by @xcite .",
    "catalog compilation and data reduction details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this catalog was matched to the ogle - iii ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) smc fundamental mode ( fu ) cepheid catalog from @xcite .",
    "distributions of the separation between the matched _",
    "akari _ sources and the input smc cepheids catalogs and the corresponding pl relations for the matched sources are presented in figure [ separation ] and [ rawpl ] , respectively .",
    "@xcite did not survey the entire smc , but instead they made @xmath23 individual pointings with @xmath24 field - of - view .",
    "hence the number of matched sources is low .",
    "from these two figures , it is clear that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 have a definite pl relation , however , the sequence is not visible in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bands . furthermore , majority of the data points in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bands could be falsely matched points for the _ akari _ and ogle - iii catalogs , and are approaching the detection limits in their respective bands . therefore , only the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands data were tested further for deriving the pl relations in this paper . finally , cepheids with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is pulsational period in days , were removed from the sample due to two reasons : ( i ) it has been well known that smc cepheids with @xmath27 follow a different pl relations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) ; and ( ii ) these short period cepheids may be affected by incompleteness limits as shown in left panels of figure [ rawpl ] .      as in paper i , the available times of observation for _ akari _ photometry can be converted to phases of pulsation , @xmath28 , for the matched sources .",
    "together with the knowledge of full phased @xmath0 band light curves from ogle - iii @xcite , mis - matching of the _ akari _ sources can be eliminated using the random - phase color curves ( defined as @xmath29-akari[\\phi]$ ] , where @xmath29 $ ] is the @xmath0 band magnitude that is closest to @xmath30 photometry at phase @xmath28 ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    to guide the selection of well - matched sources from the random - phase color curves , the range of the colors as a function of phases was determined using the _ spitzer _ light curves photometric data for lmc cepheids available from @xcite .",
    "the authors have observed @xmath31 lmc cepheids with _",
    "spitzer _ in @xmath32 and @xmath33 bands , with @xmath20 evenly - spaced data points per light curves .",
    "for @xmath34 cepheids that have the full @xmath0 band light curves from ogle - iii lmc cepheid catalogs @xcite , the random - phase color curves were constructed using all @xmath20 _ spitzer _ data points .",
    "distributions of the random - phase colors as a function of phases for these cepheids were displayed in figure [ spitzer ] , where the boundaries of the distribution were determined using the boundfit code @xcite .    in figure [ color ] , the random - phase colors for matched _ akari _ sources were plotted as a function of phases and separations .",
    "this figure reveals that the matched sources with @xmath35 tend to have larger separations , suggesting these _ akari _ sources were mis - matched to the ogle - iii smc catalog , and should be eliminated from the samples . in contrast",
    ", most of the sources with @xmath36 have separations less than @xmath37 arc - second",
    ". some of these sources were also located near the boundary curves defined from figure [ spitzer ] . if the errors in random - phase colors are considered together with the fact that _ akari s _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are slightly different than the _",
    "spitzer s _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 bands , then matched sources with @xmath38 could be used to derive the pl relations - as in the next section .",
    "this selection criterion left @xmath39 and @xmath40 matched sources in @xmath1 and @xmath2 band , respectively .",
    "photometry for these sources is listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "a full version of this table will be published on - line : a part of the table is shown here for its layout and content .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the pl relations based on the data given in table [ tab1 ] are presented in left panels of figure [ plfinal ] .",
    "the counterparts in _ spitzer _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 band for the same cepheids listed in table [ tab1 ] were plotted in the right panels of figure [ plfinal ] .",
    "when comparing these pl relations , the dispersions of _ akari _ band pl relations are found to be larger ( @xmath41 ) than the _",
    "pl dispersions ( @xmath42 ) , suggesting that few mis - matched _ akari _ sources may still present in the sample .",
    "hence we applied an iterative @xmath43-clipping algorithm to remove the outliers presented in the pl relations .",
    "the resulting random - phase pl relations are : @xmath44 , with @xmath45 for @xmath46 cepheids ; and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 for @xmath49 cepheids .",
    "the @xmath1 pl relations are consistent with the _ spitzer _ @xmath32 band counterpart : @xmath50=-3.349(\\pm0.091)\\log p+16.570(\\pm0.067)$ ] .",
    "the @xmath2 pl relation , however , is steeper than the _ spitzer _",
    "@xmath33 band pl relation : @xmath51=-3.326(\\pm0.097)\\log p+16.502(\\pm0.071)$ ] .    knowing the time of observations for the matched _",
    "sources not only permits the selection of good candidate cepheids based on random - phase colors , but also allows the application of random - phase corrections to convert the observed random phase magnitudes to mean magnitudes .",
    "algorithms for the random - phase corrections are the same as in paper i , and will not be repeated here . the random - phase corrected pl relations , without including the @xmath0 band amplitudes in the corrections , are : @xmath52 and @xmath53 . as in paper",
    "i , pl relations using the random - phase corrections that include the @xmath0 band amplitudes term are adopted as the final pl relations :    @xmath54    the slope of the smc @xmath1 pl relation is consistent with the lmc @xmath1 band pl slope of @xmath55 presented in paper i , though it is steeper than the lmc @xmath1 pl slope or the _ spitzer _ @xmath32 band pl slope for smc cepheids given in @xcite . for the @xmath2 band pl slope",
    ", it is also found to be consistent within @xmath56 to the smc @xmath33 band pl slope @xcite , but the slope also tends to be steeper .",
    "the slope of the @xmath2 pl relation is expected to be shallower than the @xmath1 relation given the influence of the co absorption around @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the steeper @xmath1 and @xmath2 band pl slopes found in this work may be caused by the small number of cepheids present in the samples .",
    "evidence to support this hypothesis is the slopes for a smaller subset of _ spitzer _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 band pl relations ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ) , as shown in right panels of figure [ plfinal ] , also tend to be steeper than the pl slopes from full sample as given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we derived the mid - infrared smc pl relations based on publicly available _ akari _ catalog from @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the _ spitzer _ data used in @xcite , the archival _ akari _ catalog includes the time of observation that permit the calculation of pulsational phases . this in turn can be used to select good cepheid candidates based on random - phase colors and thereby derive the random - phase corrected pl relations .",
    "the steeper pl slopes found in this work may be biased due to small numbers of cepheids in selected smc regions , hence the application of these pl relations needs to be treated with cautious .",
    "complete data from surveying the entire smc using _ akari _ will be valuable to improve the determination of these pl relations and in the future distance scale work .",
