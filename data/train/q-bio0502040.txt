    "the dynamics of clonal network is a very important problem for understanding immune systems dynamics and starting from the first mathematical model of jerne @xcite a lot of mathematical models are used for modeling it ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is very well known that immune system contains many types of b - cells which can activate each other at certain conditions .",
    "if the receptors of such b - cells match each other the cells become antibody cells and they effectively recognize antigens 4a , seg , db , mar .",
    "the construction of the cell gene model allows one to understand how the same network can support different independent state of the immune system . among these states",
    "we can distinguish states which are quite different in their functional activity , for example a virgin state when the clone state is not activated , the immune state when a clone proliferates antibody cells and finally - the inhibited state  when proliferation terminates . which state is reached depends on the local topology of the network and conditions of gene presentation with the additional assumption that the parameters of the model change between early and late states one can understand how self - nonself interaction is accomplished by the clonal network . in this case",
    "several original approaches has been proposed in order to explain characteristic features of evolution of b - cell repertoire @xcite and evolution of specificity in humoral immunity based on idiotypic network @xcite .",
    "dynamics of this clonal type network with symmetric interactions probably can converge @xcite to steady or oscillatory state under very general assumptions @xcite .",
    "but in reality interactions between clones are not confined to steady states ( attractors ) but also include other almost periodic and aperiodic behaviors .",
    "the interaction between an excitatory and inhibitory clone is clearly asymmetric .",
    "assume that a self basic gene is seen by its own clone .",
    "recall @xcite that adaptation can be achieved by the suppression of this idiotypic clone by the corresponding anti - idiotypic clone .",
    "once the adaptation state is achieved , secondary presentation of the leading gene does not give rise to any network response , because the gene only increases the suppression on its clone .",
    "it would be interesting to observe if some basic modifications to the governing network model equations could be made that allow really memory retention @xcite .",
    "if it is not the case , then not being able to retain memory of former inhibitory gene encounters may not be failing of the model under regard but rather a reflection of the intrinsic properties of clonal network .",
    "the model is composed @xcite of a varying number of cell clones of different specificities that form a clonal network .",
    "each clone is characterized by its specific inhibitory and excitatory receptors , which are specified in the model by bit strings and clonal receptor string @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 normalized by the conditions @xmath3 and @xmath4 allowing for some components to bring either positive or negative signs .",
    "thereby this makes it possible to achieve suitable adaptation state through the related suppression of idiotypic clone by the corresponding anti - idiotypic clone , whose modeling within our clonal network  is realized in the framework of the postulated self - similarity of gene action and asymmetry of clone interaction .",
    "two clones can interact via soluble inhibitory genes whenever their receptor shapes , i.e. bit strings are complementary .",
    "cells that become activated proliferate and differentiate into inhibitory secreting cells .",
    "this process takes some time during which another free inhibitory cells form dynamic complexes not taking often real role within excitatory - inhibition network dynamics .",
    "the existence of invariant localized dynamic patterns says that our idiotypic clonal network possesses certain self - structured properties .",
    "asymmetric interactions within the network determinate network s working size and connectivity and determine the total inhibitory cells level . concerning the connectivity within the network",
    "one can conclude that the network in equilibrium selects for growth and retaining within the network the clones with low connectivity . within this framework low connectivity",
    "is not an intrinsic property of any particular inhibitory cell but rather is determined by the random structure of a clone s receptor and the shapes of the receptors on the other clones presented in the system .",
    "the incorporation of this meta - dynamics in this excitatory - inhibitory model one can consider as an attempt to account for the rapid enough turn over of clones in the clonal network .",
    "such processes were also studied in 8,9,cel , ban , ch within a cellular automation approach .",
    "there was found that networks of automata can be considered as dynamical systems being the discrete equivalent of differential systems .",
    "they have been recently widely used in clonal nets and cellular automata to model complex systems such as brain .",
    "one of the main advantages of these networks for a biologist involved in modeling is that the construction of a model requires a minimal knowledge about the numerical values of the parameters defining a system .",
    "the differential equation systems describing require biological data on cell lifetimes like thresholds for activation , affinity constraints of the network dynamics .",
    "most automata models do not require these data , since the basic assumption is that sell populations need only be described by a set of some discrete values , often 0 and 1 , where 0 means that a populations absent , while 1 means that it is presented at a high enough level .",
    "the corresponding interactions among populations are represented by logical functions , i.e. boolean set function , which most often are equivalent to threshold automata like physical spin systems @xcite .",
    "such a modeling can be applied to a wide class of complicated neural networks taking into account different states of development of the corresponding cells and also to system evolution differential equations discussed below .",
    "these aspects of studying our excitatory - inhibitory clonal type network are planned to be discussed in more detail in another place . in this paper",
    "we will use in part an approach devised in for @xcite describing evolution of the introduced clonal network .",
    "a network under consideration models a clonal dynamics exhibiting excitatory - inhibitory properties .",
    "it consists of interacting cell clones generated by inhibitory and excitatory genes within a fixed medium .",
    "the latter will be called a configuration phase space , depending strongly on the nature of interaction between clones . an inhibitory clone population within the network",
    "can be effectively encoded , in general , by a real @xmath5  asymmetric projector matrix of the canonical @xcite form @xmath6  where biorthogonal to each other vectors @xmath7 @xmath8  are the corresponding reciprocity receptor strings amplitudes responsible for an inhibitory clonal topology within the network and the number @xmath9 @xmath10  means exactly the amount of activated receptors belonging  to the inhibitory clone .",

    "as one can see , during the interaction between inhibitory and excitatory clones at some moments of time there are switched some new excitatory and inhibitory receptors strings , and further at next whiles of time during their interactions , some of excitatory receptors strings become depressed and some inhibitory receptors either appear or become dis - activated too .",
    "this event can be interpreted , for instance , as follows : our inhibitory clonal network solved its immune task to dis - activate the excitatory clonal sub - network , and next at some later while of time becomes idle too , leaving itself in the initial awaiting state .",
    "thereby , one can state that the model studied in this paper possesses many of properties suitable for possible responses of a real clonal network .",
    "the stimulation of the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory sub - systems demonstrates their expectable direct self - similar and complementary behavior .",
    "this model is obviously not still completely satisfactory because it needs many of external parameters accounting for the main important features of real clonal network dynamics .",
    "but we believe that the work presented in this paper is an alternative step towards better understanding the essence and nature of immune network dynamics .",
