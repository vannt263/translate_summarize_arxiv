    "the triumph of the standard electroweak model does not leave much place for new physics when describing heavy quark interactions , still less for the description of old hadron weak decays .",
    "most of the papers revising the calculations in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-meson physics try to find more accurate solutions of the problems connected with the strong interactions , but they do not change the base of the weak v  a interactions . however , the recent experimental results for the radiative @xmath5 decay in a wide range of kinematic variables @xcite and the three - particle @xmath6 decay @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) point to the impossibility of their adequate description in the framework of the v  a model . in order to explain the destructive interference in the pion decay , in ref.@xcite an additional tensor quark  lepton interaction was suggested _",
    "t = 2   g_f v_ud f_t|u_r _",
    "d_l |e_r ^ _ l , where @xmath7 is an element of the kobayashi  maskawa mixing matrix and @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "this interaction provides consistency with other experimental data on this decay @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath9 describes the strength of the interaction relative to the ordinary weak coupling .",
    "the constant @xmath9 is estimated in the framework of the relativistic quark model as @xmath10 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "calculations of @xmath9 have been done by applying the qcd techniques and the pcac hypothesis .",
    "the value obtained in this way @xmath11 is one third as low as estimated in the framework of the relativistic quark model .",
    "it seems that the accuracy of the calculations in ref.@xcite is the usual pcac accuracy and that the latter result is reliable .",
    "as was noted in ref.@xcite , such a naive form of interaction will lead , as a result of radiative corrections , to an anomalously large contribution to the @xmath12 decay , in contradiction with the experimental data . to avoid this difficulty and to describe all the meson - decay experiments [ 13 ] simultaneously , in ref.@xcite",
    "it was suggested to extend the standard model by adding two doublets of new tensor particles .",
    "thus extended electroweak model predicts , besides the appearance of a new quark ",
    "lepton interaction like eq.(1 ) , also the appearance of tensor interactions in the lepton  lepton and quark  quark sectors .",
    "the tensor interaction does not conserve chirality , and therefore , it can play an important role in the nonleptonic weak processes .",
    "particularly , in this paper we are going to demonstrate that the effective tensor quark ",
    "quark interaction gives a contribution to the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference @xmath13 of the order of the contribution from the standard v  a interaction .",
    "this is easy to understand because the strength of the new interaction is just an order of magnitude as low as @xmath14 . on the other hand , from the pcac hypothesis it follows that the chirality - nonconserving currents are enhanced by a factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the masses of the kaon and the strange quark , respectively .",
    "it is known that the minimal standard v  a model ( without taking into account large - distance contributions ) can explain only half the experimental value of the mass difference @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "formally , the large - distance contribution is suppressed by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a characteristic mass scale in the  old \" hadron physics . neglecting the large - distance contribution for the neutral kaon system",
    ", we suppose that the remaining half of @xmath21 is due to the new tensor interactions of quarks .",
    "this completely fixes the parameters of the new effective tensor interactions in all sectors .",
    "the effect of the chirality - nonconserving currents in the lepton ",
    "lepton sector ( for example , in @xmath22 decay ) is suppressed by the factor @xmath23 and falls into the experimental accuracy range .",
    "the new tensor interaction in the lepton ",
    "quark sector does not contradict the existing constraints from nuclear beta - decay @xcite either .",
    "the antisymmetric second - rank tensor fields are incorporated into the standard electroweak model as two doublets @xcite @xmath24 and @xmath25 with opposite hypercharges : @xmath26 .",
    "the yukawa interaction of the charged components of the tensor fields with the first generation of leptons @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the quarks @xmath29 , @xmath30 is _",
    "yukawa = t2 t^+ _ + t2 |u_r^ d_lu^+",
    "_ + h.c . for simplicity",
    "we accept the coupling constants for quarks and leptons to have the same value @xmath31 .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , a mixing of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 fields occurs .",
    "the propagator of the charged tensor fields in the static approximation @xmath34 is of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the ratio of the two mass parameters , associated with the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets of the higgs particles .",
    "the diagonalization of eq.(3 ) gives the mass matrix of the form @xmath39 for the fields    l t_= t _ + _ u^ , + u_= - _",
    "t^ + u _ ,    where @xmath40 /\\tan^2\\beta,\\ ] ] @xmath41 /\\tan^2\\beta,\\ ] ] and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the positive definiteness of the matrix of squared masses leads to the restriction @xmath43 .",
    "the dependence of the squared masses of the fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the parameter @xmath46 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "using lagrangian ( 2 ) and propagator ( 3 ) , one can easily write the effective interactions for various sectors .",
    "for example , in the case of a muon decaying into an electron and ( anti)neutrinos , one must add to the usual v  a interaction an interaction of the form _",
    "e = - 2   g_f f_t    momentum transferred from the muon to the electron pair , and the constant @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 .",
    "the additional interaction for semileptonic weak decays has the form _",
    "qe = - 2   g_f f_t |u _",
    "q^2   |e_r ^_el + h.c .",
    "the constant @xmath47 can be fixed from the decays @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "its value @xmath51 @xcite was evaluated in the framework of the relativistic quark model on the basis of the pion - decay experiment @xcite . in what follows we are going to work in the framework of qcd and",
    "extensively use the pcac hypothesis .",
    "therefore , we shall take the corrected value @xmath52 in accordance with ref.@xcite .",
    "a richer interaction is obtained in the pure quark ",
    "quark sector : @xmath53 { q^{\\mu}q_{\\nu } \\over q^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the independent unknown parameter @xmath54 appears just in the last term of the quark  quark interaction ( 7 ) . therefore , in order to fix it , it is natural to investigate some weak nonleptonic process .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference is most sensitive to new hypothetical particles and interactions .",
    "we will prove that the introduced new interaction ( 7 ) does not contradict @xmath21 .",
    "in the @xmath55-@xmath56 mixing calculations we shall take into account only the contributions of the @xmath29 and @xmath57 quarks ( see the box diagrams of fig.2 ) , because the @xmath31-quark contribution is suppressed by the tiny mixing angle @xmath58 . as the standard contribution that results from the @xmath59-boson exchange ( fig.1a ) gives only half the experimental value @xmath21",
    ", we suppose that the rest of @xmath18 is due to the other two diagrams with the exchange of the tensor particles ( fig.2b , c ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the second generation of quarks , caused by the tensor particles , has the same form as eq.(7 ) with obvious substitutions @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 { q^{\\mu}q_{\\nu } \\over q^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] only the first terms in eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) contribute to the interference diagrams ( fig.2b ) _ wt = - 3 g^2_f f_t 16 ^2 ^2_c ^2_c m^2_c  |s(1-^5)d |s(1+^5)d . the divergency is eliminated by the gim mechanism , as in diagrams of fig.2a .",
    "the matrix element = - ( 2 + 1 3 ) f^2_k m^2_k is calculated in the approximation of the vacuum saturation , as the vacuum is inserted in all possible channels .",
    "assuming @xmath63=160  mev and @xmath64=1.35  gev , we can estimate the contribution of the interference diagrams to @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "although the contribution of the diagrams in fig.2c seems of the order of the small parameter @xmath67 , actually , their contribution is enhanced because the suppressing gim mechanism does not work .",
    "therefore , they must be taken into account .",
    "we assume that the masses of the new tensor particles are of the order of the vector - boson mass @xmath68",
    ". then the logarithmically divergent integral is effectively cut off at this limit .",
    "such an assumption will not essentially change our results , as the logarithm is a very slowly increasing function .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the @xmath55-@xmath56 mixing due to exchange of the tensor particles ( fig.2c ) reads @xmath69 \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix elements = ( 2 + 4 3 ) f^2_k m^2_k , = - 8 3 f^2_k m^2_k , = f^2_k m^2_k , are calculated as before with the aid of the vacuum saturation hypothesis . to give the correct total mass difference @xmath18",
    ", the contribution of the diagrams in fig.2c must be negative @xmath70 .",
    "this is really the case : in the whole allowed range of the parameter @xmath43 , the contribution of fig.2c has the opposite sign relative to figs.2a , b .    the correct value of the mass difference is obtained when @xmath71 .",
    "notice that this solution @xmath72 is very close to the value 0.4 that corresponds to the maximal possible mass of the tensor field @xmath73 ( see fig.1 ) . that would provide the minimal effective potential between the fermions .",
    "it is curious to note that the mixing angle @xmath74 happens to be surprisingly close to the weinberg angle @xmath75 : @xmath76 .",
    "now let us discuss the effect of the two higgs doublets on the mass difference @xmath21 .",
    "their yukawa coupling constants with quarks are proportional to the quark masses . as far as the model - independent lower bound on the @xmath31-quark mass is @xmath77@xmath7890  gev ( i.e. the @xmath31 quark is very heavy ) , the contribution of the virtual @xmath31 quarks to the box diagrams may become dominant in spite of the strong suppression of the yukawa interaction owing to the tiny mixing angle @xmath58 .",
    "if the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets of the higgs particles @xmath79 were large , this could enhance the contribution of the higgs particles to the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference ( according to the analysis in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , the value of @xmath80 estimated above does not lead to a large ratio @xmath81 , and respectively , gives no considerable enhancement of the contribution of the two higgs doublets to the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference as compared to the case of only one doublet in the minimal standard model .",
    "there exists a great uncertainty in the values of the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa matrix elements for the @xmath31 quark .",
    "we use here the central values @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite . in fig.3",
    "the relative contribution of the higgs doublets to the actual @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference is shown .",
    "the curves in the plane of two parameters  the charged - higgs mass @xmath84 and the @xmath31-quark mass @xmath77  correspond to the fixed values of the relative contribution .",
    "obviously , the contribution of the higgs doublets increases with the increase of the @xmath31-quark mass and the decrease of the higgs mass .",
    "there exists a bound on the value of the @xmath31-quark mass from the tevatron : @xmath85gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the tensor particles are included into a more complete supersymmetric theory which ensures the unification of the coupling constants and of the @xmath86@xmath87 masses @xcite .",
    "then , using the value of @xmath88 obtained above , one can estimate the @xmath31-quark mass as @xmath89  gev . in these theories",
    "the masses of the charged higgs particles are above @xmath90  gev .",
    "therefore , for the realistic choice @xmath77=170  gev and @xmath84@xmath78260  gev , the contribution to @xmath13 is less than @xmath91 .",
    "such an accuracy is compatible with the assumptions made : the pcac hypothesis , the vacuum - saturation approximation , disregard of the large - distance contributions , etc .    in interactions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 quarks with the charged tensor particles , two additional generation - mixing matrices of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa type arise : between left ",
    "right and right  left quarks .",
    "unfortunately , because of the lack of information about these matrices , we can not say anything more definite about the contribution of the tensor particles to the @xmath94 violation in the @xmath55-@xmath56 system .",
    "the experimental data [ 13 ] point to an admixture of tensor currents in the weak decays . in the electroweak model extended by the doublets of tensor particles",
    ", we can fix all the parameters of effective interactions of the charged tensor currents , using the cited experiments and the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference .",
    "the model predicts neutral tensor currents too , but it is as yet impossible to define this sector because of the lack of experimental data . at the moment",
    "we can definitely say only that there exists a requirement that the flavor - changing neutral tensor currents should be absent .",
    "when estimating the mixing parameter @xmath54 from the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass difference , we have neglected the qcd corrections .",
    "taking them into account may correct the value of @xmath54  the presented value @xmath80 was obtained for bare quarks . as we have accepted the same coupling of the tensor fields to leptons and quarks , the effective lepton  lepton and quark  lepton tensor interactions are governed by a single common parameter @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , by fixing this parameter from the semileptonic decays , @xmath95 , we can make a prediction for the weak leptonic decays , where no uncertainty associated with the strong interactions is present .    unfortunately , all previous attempts to study the violation of the v  a structure of interaction in the @xmath22 decay have been done on the basis of the derivative - free effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the effective tensor interactions presented here essentially depend on the momentum transfer .",
    "certainly , this will lead to a different angular and energy distribution of the outgoing electron .",
    "nevertheless , we can estimate the contribution of the new interaction to the michel parameter @xmath96 .",
    "its value @xmath97 is of the same order of magnitude as the present experimental accuracy @xcite .",
