    "the central panel shows @xmath191 ; we see that the oscillator state converges to one with small fluctuations about a reasonably well defined mean oscillation level , indicating that the oscillators remain in a relatively highly excited state described to good approximation by a time independent distribution with negligible phase coherence between different number states .",
