    "the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey @xcite performed with the pn channel of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) ( * ? ? ? * see also @xcite ) is proving to be a useful resource for the discovery of bright new x - ray sources .",
    "the slew survey makes use of data taken while the satellite is manouevering between pointed observations , reaching five to ten times deeper in flux than all other all - sky spatially - resolved surveys in the 212kev band .",
    "it also reaches comparable sensitivity to the _ rosat _ pspc all - sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the 0.22kev band .",
    "the latest release of the clean slew catalogue ( xmmsl1 - delta4 ) contains 11425 sources detected over 28000 deg@xmath3 of which 72% are previously known in x - rays or have plausible counterparts from other wavebands .",
    "several interesting transients have been discovered including novae @xcite , tidal disruption candidates @xcite and flare stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a quarter of the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey sources are relatively bright yet appear to have no previous , catalogued x - ray detections .",
    "cross - correlation with the rass showed that of order 50% of the slew survey point - like sources do not have rass counterparts .",
    "potential explanations for the lack of previous x - ray detections of these slew survey sources include transient or highly variable x - ray behaviour ( perhaps such sources are seen in a ` high ' state during the _ xmm - newton _ observations ) or hard x - ray spectra ( meaning that most of the counts fall outside the _ rosat _ energy range ) .",
    "further possibilities include an inaccurate slew survey position : the 1@xmath1 position error is 8@xmath0 but this has a long tail ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) ; or spurious detections : @xmath44% of the sources in the clean slew survey catalogue are expected to be spurious from statistical considerations @xcite .",
    "it is important to try and complete the identifications of the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey catalogue , so as to allow flux - limited samples to be drawn from the survey and to develop a fuller picture of the x - ray transient source population .",
    "here we present follow - up observations of a sample of unidentified _ xmm - newton _ slew survey x - ray sources with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite .",
    "we attempt to classify the sources by obtaining more accurate localisations with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope , measuring any x - ray variability and where possible identifying the broadband spectral properties using all instruments on - board _ swift _ and information from published optical , near infrared ( nir ) and radio catalogues . the main body of the paper details the sample , our analyses and general results .",
    "discussion of individual sources is given in the appendix .",
    "we selected our sample from the xmmsl1 catalogue ( 2007 august ) to include sources which , in either the full ( 0.2@xmath512kev ) , hard ( 2@xmath512kev ) or soft ( 0.2@xmath52kev ) bands : ( a ) were detected with likelihood @xmath610 , ( b ) were detected with @xmath64 counts , ( c ) had a low value of fitted source extent ( best band extent @xmath710 pixels ) , and ( d ) were not consistent with any known source in a multiple - catalogue search ( including simbad , ned and rass to within 30@xmath0 , see table 6 of @xcite for the complete list ) .",
    "this resulted in 97 sources , of which 94 have _ swift _ pointed observations and are presented here .",
    "full - band ( 0.212 kev ) x - ray fluxes for the sample , as given in the xmmsl1 catalogue , range from @xmath4(230)@xmath810@xmath9 erg @xmath10 s@xmath11 and the sources are distributed apparently randomly across the sky ( fig . [ aitoff ] ) .",
    "we observed the 94 sources defined in section [ sample ] with all instruments on - board _ swift _ simultaneously : the wide field of view burst alert telescope ( bat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) operating in the energy range 15150 kev , and the narrow - field instruments - the x - ray telescope ( xrt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot , * ? ? ?",
    "the observations with xrt ( table [ tab : obs ] ) were designed to be performed in photon counting ( pc ) mode and to have a minimum exposure time of 1.8ks , to obtain an improved x - ray position and some spectral information .",
    "these observations were performed as ` fill - in ' targets which can be overridden when _ swift _ slews to higher priority targets such as gamma - ray bursts , resulting in exposure times varying from 240s up to 10220s .",
    "the total exposure time per source may have been continuously accumulated or be spread over a number of months , from 2006 august to 2009 december . where possible , observations with the uvot have been carried out using the @xmath12 filter to optimise uvot - enhanced x - ray position determination ( described in section [ positions ] ) .",
    "bat data from the pointed observations have been combined with data from the bat 58-month survey ( baumgartner et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ; see also @xcite ) to increase detection likelihood .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the majority of our sample of unidentified x - ray sources from the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey are not detected with _",
    "swift_. while the nature of these sources is difficult to determine , it is very important to attempt to do so in order to understand the complete population identified by the slew survey .",
    "we expect to pick up large numbers of transients due to the requirement that sample sources were not already identified from a variety of multiwavelength catalogue searches ( section [ sample ] ) .",
    "we only required a detection in one of the three slew survey energy bands , with a minimum of 4 source counts , so we also expect that some fraction of these identifications will be spurious .",
    "firstly , we address the issue of spurious detections .",
    "statistical considerations leads to an estimate of 4% that are expected to be spurious sources in the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey clean catalogue @xcite .",
    "this figure does not apply directly to our sample , as it was calculated on full - band detections and for the entire catalogue ( i.e. without applying the source selection criteria used here ) , but can be used as a guide .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ full - band detection likelihoods of our sample range from 10 to 556 ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "the mean detection likelihoods for the xrt - detected and xrt non - detected sources are 37 and 32 respectively , i.e. the confidence in these detections is approximately equal for an average source from each population , using this measure alone .",
    "we searched the 2mass catalogue for bright nir sources coincident with the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey positions ( the nir being less susceptible to extinction than optical bands ) .",
    "we found that 27% of the xrt non - detected slew survey sources have one or more catalogued nir sources brighter than @xmath13 mag within 15@xmath0 . to estimate the fraction for which this will be true simply by chance",
    ", we generated 10000 random sky positions and cross - correlated these with the 2mass catalogue .",
    "this leads to the expectation that a 2mass source brighter than @xmath14 mag will appear within 15@xmath0 of a random sky position around 7.9% of the time .",
    "the fraction expected by chance is therefore much lower than obtained for our sample of xrt non - detected sources .",
    "we can conclude from this that some fraction of our non - detected subset must be real . for our xrt - detected subset ,",
    "only 30% of the sources would have been recovered when performing the same @xmath15 mag cut ; for example in the case of flare stars we expect only the closest sources to be found this way . so finding a bright nir counterpart strongly suggests the x - ray source is real , while the lack of a counterpart is not constraining .",
    "we then investigated the distribution of our detected and non - detected subsets over the slew survey energy bands .",
    "sources can appear in any one of the hard ( 212 kev ) , soft ( 0.22 kev ) and full ( 0.212 kev ) bands , or could appear in multiple bands .",
    "sources which appear in all three bands we term hard+soft .",
    "figure [ slewhistograms ] shows the numbers of detected ( shaded areas ) and non - detected sample sources that are hard ( only ) , soft ( only ) , full ( only ) or hard+soft band detections in the slew survey against the number of measured counts per source .",
    "we see that most of the sample were soft only ( soft or soft+full band ) slew survey detections , reflecting the observed x - ray source population in general .",
    "we also expect a greater number of objects with low numbers of counts in the slew survey soft band than in the hard band because , a ) many of these sources are expected to be unabsorbed agn : their emission is greater in the soft band and follows a power law such that sources close to the detection limit may appear soft - only , and , b ) the background is higher in the hard band making source detection more difficult .",
    "the bright nir counterpart search described above returned a match for xrt non - detected sources from the hard , soft and hard+soft categories , in the ratios 1.0  :  2.5  :  0.2 ( for comparison , all xrt non - detected sources follow the ratios 1.0  :  1.65  :  0.2 for the same bands ) .",
    "there are 11 sources detected in all 3 slew survey bands , and we can be confident that these sources are all astrophysical yet only 36% are swift - detected .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of the xrt non - detected sample are highly variable sources .",
    "of the 55 soft - only sources , 22 are xrt detected , a further 2 are bat detected and a further 12 have @xmath15 mag nir sources within 15@xmath0 . from our estimates , described earlier , @xmath42 of the soft - only sources may be coincident with a @xmath15 mag nir source by chance .",
    "we can therefore say that at least 34 out of 55 ( 62% ) are likely to be real astrophysical sources .",
    "the remaining 38% may comprise 30% with @xmath16 band counterparts below the brightness cut we imposed , following the proportion seen in the xrt - detected source population ; just 8% or approximately 4 sources are then left unaccounted for and could potentially be spurious . of the 21 hard - only sources , just one is detected with xrt and one is detected with bat .",
    "a further 5 have bright nir sources in the vicinity of which 12 may be chance coincidences . if we again adopt the fraction 30% for real sources likely to have nir counterparts fainter than @xmath14 , we find 38% of all the xrt / bat non - detected hard - only sources would be considered real .",
    "this provides an upper bound on the fraction of hard - only sample sources that are potentially spurious .",
    "full band only slew survey sources comprise 10% of the xrt non - detected sources .",
    "we have found no catalogued bright , nearby @xmath16 band sources for this subsample . in summary , there are likely to be some spurious sources included in the full - only and hard - only subsamples , while the vast majority if not all the soft - only sources as well as all the hard+soft sources are probably astrophysical .",
    "we now focus on the nature of the xrt non - detected sources .",
    "the distribution on the sky of xrt non - detected sources appears very similar to that of the detected sources ( fig .",
    "[ aitoff ] ) .",
    "the median of the galactic column densities , @xmath17 , in those directions is not significantly different for the detected and non - detected samples , but we note that this could have hampered the detection of xmmsl1j164456.7@xmath5450015 and xmmsl1j183233.0@xmath5112539 which may lie behind particularly large galactic columns of 1.65@xmath810@xmath18 @xmath10 and 1.13@xmath810@xmath18 @xmath10 respectively . the lack of detections with _",
    "swift _ bat argues against a population of heavily obscured agn ( section [ bat ] ) . to support this",
    "we compared expected xrt count rates for typical agn at @xmath19 with observed 0.310kev flux 10@xmath9",
    "erg @xmath10 s@xmath11 , power law photon index @xmath20 , galactic column density @xmath21 @xmath10 and intrinsic x - ray absorbing columns of @xmath22 , 10@xmath18 and 10@xmath23 @xmath10 , and find the count rate is reduced by 64% at most , which is not enough to push these sources into our xrt non - detected category .",
    "an intrinsic column density of @xmath24 @xmath10 is required to bring the 0.310kev xrt count rate for this spectral shape down to the mean detection limit for this sample .",
    "we require greater variability among the non - detected sources , shown in fig .",
    "[ countrates]a ; with variability corresponding to flux changes of up to a factor @xmath4300 .",
    "these highly variable sources remain an enigma and are likely to do so until they are seen again , perhaps as they undergo an x - ray outburst or otherwise enter a high flux state .",
    "_ swift _ observations of a sample of 94 unidentified x - ray sources from the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey have been carried out , with 29% of the sample sources detected with xrt .",
    "this low detection rate supports the hypothesis that many of these sources are highly variable or x - ray transient objects .",
    "the x - ray emission or upper limit to the emission for all the sources , taking into account count rate conversion between instruments and eddington bias , lies at or below that seen in the slew survey .",
    "up to two thirds of the xrt detected sources could have remained constant in flux between the slew survey and _ swift _ observations .",
    "approximately one third of the xrt detected sources and also the majority of the xrt non - detected sources are likely to be variable .",
    "the x - ray positions we derived from the _ swift _ data for the xrt - detected sources improved the mean 90% confidence error radius from 18.9@xmath0 to 2.9@xmath0 .",
    "this reduced the number of uvot and catalogued optical matches to just a single source in most cases . performing a new cross - correlation of the 3@xmath1 error radii with multiwavelength catalogues revealed that six sources can be associated with known objects and 8 sources",
    "may be associated with unidentified _ rosat _ sources .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of most of the sources can be fit with an absorbed power law with photon indices clustering around @xmath25 , typical of agn .",
    "the random distribution across the sky of this and the non - detected population is also consistent with an agn classification . to identify the types of objects included in the xrt detected sample we used a number of further indicators : the x - ray to optical flux ratio , proper motion , nir colours , radio associations and detection in @xmath26-rays with bat .",
    "we summarise the proposed source classifications in table [ tab : ids ] .",
    "we find 10 of the 30 xrt- and/or bat - detected sources are clearly stellar in nature , including one periodic variable star and 2 high proper motion stars .",
    "eleven sources are classified as agn , 4 of which are detected in hard x - rays with bat and 3 of which have redshifts spanning @xmath2 obtained from the literature or from optical spectroscopy . a further 3 sources are suspected agn and 1 is a candidate galactic hard x - ray flash , while 5 sources remain unclassified .",
    "interestingly , the 2 most variable sources on time scales of a few years ( between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ observations ) are among those which we can not classify here .",
    "we plan to obtain optical spectroscopy where possible for all these sources , which will confirm or determine their identifications , as demonstrated in section [ optspectroscopy ] for xmmsl1j064109.2@xmath5565542 .",
    "the xrt / bat non - detected population are equally important to classify , but the lack of information makes this task far more difficult .",
    "the majority of these are likely highly variable sources , and from the lack of bat detections we can to a large extent rule out a population of heavily obscured agn .",
    "we also expect some fraction of these sources may be spurious detections .",
    "we compared the non - detected population with the detected population in terms of the distribution of _ xmm - newton _ slew survey counts in each of the hard , soft and full bands .",
    "the x - ray error circles from the slew survey are somewhat large for a full optical / nir counterpart search , so instead we looked for bright nir sources within 15@xmath0 of the slew survey position , and compared this to the number expected in a chance coincidence .",
    "combining these two sets of information , we estimate the fraction of astrophysical sources as opposed to spurious detections among the xrt non - detected population for each slew survey band . all the hard+soft band detections are extremely likely to be real , and we find that most if not all the soft sources are also likely to be real ; 73% of all sample sources fall into these two categories .",
    "perhaps 60% of the 21 hard - only sources could be spurious .",
    "we stress , however , that these figures are only estimates and there is potential for as yet unknown source types within these populations .",
    "it is likely that the nature of each _ swift _ non - detected source will remain elusive until they are once again detected , permitting further study .    in summary",
    ", the xrt - detected population seems to consist of approximately equal numbers of x - ray active stars and background agn , while the undetected population may contain more extragalactic objects such as agn .",
    "type ii agn were perhaps expected to be the dominant population due to their lack of soft x - ray emission , given that this sample was selected based on _ rosat _ soft x - ray non - detections , but we identify only one possible type ii candidate among the xrt - detected population .",
    "neither are they numerous among the xrt non - detected sources as implied by the lack of bat detections . a knowledge of the source types detected in surveys such as the _ xmm - newton _ slew survey is important for investigation of the @xmath27 and completing studies of the x - ray background that can not be done with pointed observations alone .",
