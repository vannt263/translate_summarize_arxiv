    "the initial discovery of superconductivity in the cuprates precipitated a rush to find higher values of the critical temperature @xmath1 . in this onslaught , not only were new superconducting members of the cuprate family discovered but it was quickly realized that , through oxygen doping or doping with other elements , a particular compound could display a range of @xmath1 values . with hole - doping ,",
    "in particular , these @xmath1 values could be quite high and showed a dome for @xmath1 as a function of doping in the phase diagram . while studying optimal doping for the maximum @xmath1 became the primary focus in initial research , it was later appreciated that the unusual phase diagram of these materials was of great interest in itself . understanding why a maximum @xmath1 exists and what controls the reduction of @xmath1 away from maximum",
    "is hoped to elucidate the physics of the interactions involved .",
    "ideally this would give direction for what might be attempted in materials development in order to enhance @xmath1 .",
    "further research into the general phase diagram occurred on many fronts , with evidence of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating state in the parent compound and at low doping , and strange metallic behavior in the normal state above the superconducting dome .",
    "the most intriguing discovery is possibly the presence of what is now termed a `` pseudogap '' feature , occurring in the normal state on the underdoped side of the superconducting dome , which exists for higher temperatures as the afm state is approached.@xcite this pseudogap is an energy gap - like feature seen in normal state properties which has led to a number of imaginative theoretical proposals for its existence .",
    "superconductivity in the cuprates is now thought to have @xmath2-wave superconducting pairing , most likely due to spin - fluctuations.@xcite it is thought , therefore , that the approach towards the afm state should enhance the spin - fluctuation pairing interaction @xmath3 and hence increase @xmath1 .",
    "however , if this pseudogap represents a competing phase , possibly associated with the afm - mott insulator , it could be responsible for a reduction in the electronic density of states at the fermi level @xmath4 which could then reduce the superconducting @xmath1 which depends on @xmath5 in simple bcs theory .",
    "consequently , it is natural that many proposals for the pseudogap state have been based on a competing phase , such as , the @xmath2-density wave theory.@xcite others have been suggested which include the ideas of preformed pairs@xcite arising above @xmath1 .    the pseudogap phase and",
    "how it may affect superconductivity has become a major focus of both theoretical and experimental work .",
    "even knowledge of where the pseudogap line in the phase diagram might end [ possibly at @xmath0 and possibly as a quantum critical point ( qcp ) ] is still a matter of debate .",
    "some experiments suggest it ends on the edge of the superconducting dome on the overdoped side and others place it ending at @xmath0 inside the superconducting zone anywhere from optimal doping to overdoped.@xcite it should be noted that other works on qcps in heavy fermion superconductors usually suggest such a point existing under the superconducting dome.@xcite    in spite of mounting experimental work on the underdoped cuprate superconductors , it has been hard to develop a microscopic theory that can build in the physics associated with the approach from the metallic state to the mott insulator and give a workable formalism , which includes doping , for providing theoretical insights and predictions for experiments both in the normal and superconducting state ( including the idea of a pseudogap ) .",
    "further to this issue has been the more recent experimental development where a possible reconstruction of the fermi surface in the underdoped cuprates has been found to occur based on seeing fermi pockets from de haas - van alphen experiments@xcite and or fermi arcs in angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments.@xcite there has also been one report of an observation of pockets from arpes.@xcite moreover , there has been indirect evidence of arcs from other experiments , such as optical spectroscopy@xcite , specific heat@xcite and scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite measurements . indeed , attempting to resolve the arc versus pocket debate has been the subject of numerous papers .",
    "one theory which is promising in this regard has been due to yang , rice and zhang@xcite ( yrz ) which is based on previous studies of a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) spin liquid state originally proposed by anderson@xcite .",
    "the merit of the yrz approach is that they have used previous numerical and theoretical rvb - type studies to develop an ansatz for the many - body green s function that would represent the rvb spin liquid .",
    "this ansatz builds in the approach to the afm - mott insulator and shows a reconstructed fermi surface which is a large fermi surface when there is no pseudogap , above optimal doping , but is reconstructed to small fermi or luttinger pockets ( which look more like arcs when the quasiparticle weight is included ) for the underdoped case .",
    "the pseudogap opens up around the afm brillouin zone in this theory and it gaps out or reconstructs part of the fermi surface .",
    "so far this theory has been used to evaluate a number of experimental properties@xcite with good qualitative agreement and , in the same spirit as bcs theory , using this ansatz allows us to determine what are the essential elements that should go into a more sophisticated microscopic theory should it be developed in the future .    in this work",
    ", we wish to examine the long - standing puzzle associated with the penetration depth measurements .",
    "the penetration depth was one of the first experiments to clearly indicate that a @xmath2-wave order parameter symmetry for the superconductivity was present in the cuprates.@xcite this was an extremely important result in influencing the direction of research in this field as it allowed for the elimination of a number of possible mechanisms for cooper pairing .",
    "it also clarified the need for very high quality samples to remove the obscuring features due to impurities .",
    "the essential observation from the experiment was that the superfluid density @xmath6 , which is related to the penetration depth @xmath7 by @xmath8 , showed a low temperature linear @xmath9 behavior as expected for a clean bcs @xmath2-wave superconductor , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the underdoped regime , it is known@xcite that while the zero temperature value of the superfluid density depends strongly on the doping @xmath11 , the coefficient @xmath12 of the first linear - in-@xmath9 correction is much less sensitive to @xmath11 .",
    "this result can not be understood within a simple bcs @xmath2-wave model .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study the penetration depth in the yrz model and to see if the experimental data , with its doping dependence , can be explained by this theory .",
    "furthermore , we wish to see if there is evidence for a reconstructed fermi surface in the penetration depth data . with this study",
    "we can develop a better understanding of the physics which is giving rise to this non - bcs behavior of the doping dependence of the penetration depth .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce the basic features of the yrz theory that enter into our calculations .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the penetration depth formula used in this work and its various limits , given in section  iii . in section",
    "iv , we summarize some theoretical formulas associated with the frequency - dependent optical conductivity , a quantity which is also related to the penetration depth .",
    "this will aid in our discussion of the drude weight and the sum rule .",
    "we then present our results in section  v and provide our conclusions in section  vi .",
    "the yrz model provides an ansatz for the coherent part of the many - body green s function for the case of a doped rvb spin liquid .",
    "it includes a dependence on doping @xmath11 and is given as:@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 in these expressions @xmath15 is the first nearest neighbor tight - binding dispersion , which introduces the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary ( afbz ) into the green s function along which the pseudogap @xmath16 develops . the band structure @xmath17 is taken from tight - binding for a system which includes hopping terms up to third nearest neighbor , with @xmath18 , a chemical potential determined by the luttinger sum rule.@xcite doping dependence enters in three ways into the green s function .",
    "first , the band structure is doping dependent through the hopping coefficients : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gutzwiller factors and @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the @xmath11-dependence of these coefficients reflects the fact that strong correlations will narrow the bands as the mott insulator is approached .",
    "second , the coherent part of the green s function changes with doping with a gutzwiller factor given by @xmath29 .",
    "such factors reflect the projection out of doubly occupied states and the approach to the atomic limit .",
    "third , the magnitude of the pseudogap , @xmath16 , and superconducting gap , @xmath30 , are also doping dependent , as inferred from experiment and the behavior of @xmath1 .",

    "the presence of the two bands gives rise to interband transitions in the frequency - dependent optical conductivity and a depletion of the intraband drude component as we will later discuss .    in the following work",

    "is obtained when the pseudogap is set equal to zero and is for comparison with the short - dashed red curve which includes the pseudogap and is labeled yrz .",
    "we note two striking differences between these two sets of results .",
    "first , as a function of temperature , the fl curve shows concave down behavior .",
    "this differs slightly from the perhaps more classical curve for a @xmath2-wave superconductor in a model , where the continuum approximation is used for the band structure and a @xmath101 gap variation is assumed on the cylindrical fermi surface , but is mainly due to our use of a gap ratio of @xmath161 rather than the weak coupling bcs @xmath2-wave value of 4.28 .",
    "the use of a larger value for this ratio is in keeping with experimental observation that finds it of order of 6 ( and occasionally reported to be even larger ) .",
    "our results also represent a generalization in which the superconducting gap varies over the entire brillouin zone and the band structure is given in tight - binding with up to third nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the same gap and bands are used for the red dashed curve which by contrast shows slight concave upward variation as a function of temperature . here",
    "a pseudogap is included and this has changed the usual large fermi surface of fermi liquid theory which is shown in one quadrant of the brillouin zone in the top inset , to the fermi surface shown in the middle inset . here , the blue curve is the luttinger pocket of the yrz theory and the red line is its shadow extension which represents a momentum contour of minimum approach to the `` fermi surface '' in regions of momentum space where a gap exists so there are no true zero energy states .",
    "this reconstruction of the fermi surface into a luttinger pocket , which by its construction contains exactly @xmath11 empty states ( holes ) , has led to a large suppression of the zero temperature penetration depth as expected in our simplified eq .",
    "( [ eq : pen6 ] ) .",
    "the second striking feature of these two curves is that they have identical values of slope , as a function of temperature @xmath9 , out of @xmath0 .",
    "the formation of the luttinger pockets , as the pseudogap increases in the underdoped regime of @xmath11 below the qcp at @xmath48 in our phase diagram , reduces the amount of fermi surface that is available for pairing as in other competing order parameter scenarios@xcite , but leaves the nodal region ungapped .",
    "the very low temperature excitations out of the ground state are confined to the cone very near zero energy , which exists in the nodal direction only , but these excitations do not sample directly the pseudogap and so the slope retains its fermi liquid value .",
    "the final curve in fig .  [ fig3 ] ( green dash - dotted ) is a case where we have cut off the superconducting gap outside the solid angle @xmath162 which defines the region of the luttinger pocket , with @xmath46 shown in the lower inset .",
    "as we expect from the above arguments this does not change the low temperature slope but does affect the zero temperature value of the superfluid stiffness which is further reduced over its fermi liquid value .",

    "all is not ideal , however .",
    "we have used a normalized quantity here . in absolute value , we find that the superfluid density is off by about a factor of 3 - 4 . nonetheless , this can be rectified as the penetration depth depends only on @xmath170 and so one could increase the value of @xmath170 to account for this .",
    "this would then require an adjustment of the gap ratio to keep the good agreement with the @xmath1 dome of fig .",

    "an analysis based on arpes has given somewhat different results.@xcite it should be noted that we extracted the slope values ourselves and so this is not a rigorous representation of the data and indeed the temperature - dependence of some of the experimental curves was unusual in a few cases , but we took the lowest temperature value of the slope in any event .",
    "the optimal doping curve was in this category as it showed an upturn at low temperature in the case of the pure sample and so its slope value and a few of the others could be revised in the hands of experimental experts .",

    "( [ eq : bpen ] ) the superfluid density remains directly proportional to a factor of @xmath194 and so manifestly vanishes in the normal state , the energy @xmath195 involves the sum of the squares of @xmath30 and @xmath16 rather than the square of @xmath30 alone .",
    "it is only through this factor that the pseudogap enters in this simplification .",
    "the fermi arc model@xcite corresponds to taking @xmath16 non - zero only on an arc centered about the antinodal direction , leaving an ungapped region centered around the nodal direction ( on the luttinger pocket ) as illustrated by the center insert in fig .",

    ", here we retain its cosine form @xmath31 but cut it off on an arc defined by the angle @xmath46 previously introduced .",
    "taking @xmath196 , chosen to get a best fit to the penetration depth curve of the yrz model ( solid black curve ) , one obtains the red open circles which overlap the black solid curve almost perfectly .",
    "thus with the right choice of @xmath197 , one can get an almost perfect match between the two models .",
    "if we further assume that the superconducting gap is present only on the ungapped ( by the pseudogap that is , see right hand inset ) part of the fermi surface , we obtain the dashed curve denoted arc mod . this has pushed the penetration depth down by about the same amount as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the full yrz calculation when we included a superconducting gap modification in this model . the choice of @xmath198 in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] is important as can be seen from the dash - dotted blue curve which is also based on an arc model but with a different cut off model @xmath199 , a value obtained from the size of the arc subtended by the actual luttinger pocket of the yrz theory .",
    "while this choice decreases further the magnitude of the superfluid density because there is even less ungapped arc , it does not change the qualitative behavior obtained .",
    "finally , the solid green curve with triangles is our result for the nodal liquid which corresponds to lifting the cut off on the pseudogap . in this case",
    "an effective gap of @xmath200 replaces the usual superconducting gap in the standard eq .",
    "( [ eq : bpen ] ) for @xmath65 with one critical difference . in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bpen ] ) , it is still @xmath201 which remains and not @xmath202 .",

    "( [ eq : bpen ] ) by @xmath202 and take out the factor of @xmath203 $ ] to compensate for this . thus the equation for the penetration depth becomes the standard one for an effective superconducting gap of @xmath200 but with the difference that a factor of the square of superconducting - to - effective - gap amplitude is to multiply the entire expression as we see explicitly in our simplified expression ( [ eq : pen4 ] ) .",
    "while these simplifications allow us to obtain simple analytic expressions , we see that this limit fails to give quantitative results when compared with yrz .",
    "compare the green curve with triangles with the solid black curve in fig  [ fig9 ] .",
    "in fact one should not expect the two models to agree .",
    "the nodal liquid is the limit when the size of the luttinger pocket tends to zero .",
    "but this is never reached inside the superconducting dome . in our calculations at a doping where @xmath1 has been depressed to zero , there remains a sizable part of the fermi surface which is ungapped .",
    "it is not surprising then that the nodal liquid should show qualitative behavior not part of the arc model , such as , a superfluid density at @xmath0 which decreases by a factor of the square of the ratio of superconducting to pseudogap .",
    "the slope of the linear - in-@xmath9 variation at low temperature also becomes inversely proportional to @xmath204 rather than to @xmath30 and so becomes very flat .",
    "yrz have provided a simple model for the coherent part of the charge carrier green s function which applies below a quantum critical point characterizing the beginning of pseudogap formation . as the mott - hubbard transition to an insulating state",
    "is approached with decreasing doping , the magnitude of the pseudogap increases , the bands narrow and the weight of the coherent piece of the green s function decreases according to well - defined gutzwiller factors which account for correlation effects . with increasing pseudogap magnitude , the fermi surface reconstructs .",
    "it goes from the large fermi surface of fermi liquid theory to ever smaller luttinger pockets .",
    "this leads directly to a reduction of the value of the zero temperature inverse squared penetration depth because there are fewer ungapped states which are available to form the condensate .",
    "we show that this reduction is roughly proportional to the ratio of the remaining arc length , defined by the luttinger pocket , to the full length of the corresponding fermi liquid surface . on the other hand , and in sharp contrast",
    ", the coefficient of the linear - in - temperature term of @xmath65 at small @xmath9 remains largely unaffected because this quantity depends only on the available very low energy excitations and these are confined to the vicinity of the nodal dirac points .",
    "this region is not importantly affected by pseudogap formation and implied fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "a comparison of our results with recent experimental data on bi:2212 gives good qualitative agreement and demonstrates the importance of the strong dependence on doping of the coherence weight in the yrz model which derives from strong correlation effects .",
    "while this is a simple multiplicative factor , it accounts for a significant part of the reduction in superfluid density as the end of the superconducting dome is approached in the deeply underdoped region of the phase diagram .",
    "an additional reduction is due to luttinger pocket formation which starts at the doping associated with the quantum critical point and this effect provides a more abrupt change in magnitude which should be measurable as a signature of fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "the well - known ferrell - glover - tinkham sum rule of conventional superconductivity was found to apply here as well .",
    "the optical weight lost on entering the superconducting state below @xmath1 reappears in its entirety in the superfluid fraction .",
    "comparison of our results with those based on an arc model , with pseudogap placed on the fermi surface rather than on the afbz of the yrz model , can be made to agree very well if the arc length on which the pseudogap is assumed to be non - zero is appropriately chosen to obtain a best fit with the yrz case .",
    "the nodal liquid concept corresponds to the limit when the fermi surface is fully gapped by the pseudogap except for the nodal points .",
    "this limit is never reached in yrz theory because the size of the luttinger pocket remains quite significant at the doping which corresponds to the end of the superconducting dome .",

    "<S> fermi surface reconstruction , which is an essential element of the model , has a strong effect on the superfluid density at @xmath0 producing a sharp drop in magnitude , but does not change the slope of the linear low temperature variation . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with recent data on bi - based cuprates provides validation of the theory and shows that the effects of correlations , captured by gutzwiller factors , are essential for a qualitative understanding of the data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ferrell - glover - tinkham sum rule still holds and we compare our results with those for the fermi arc and the nodal liquid models . </S>"
