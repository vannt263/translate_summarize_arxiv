    "one of the most well known examples is graphene where the electrons at the fermi energy behave as relativistic massless particles @xcite .",
    "graphene is a promising material for integration in nanoscale devices due to its high carrier mobility , and therefore has been considered for implementation in semimetals @xcite , nanoelectronics@xcite , coherent devices @xcite , and field - effect transistors @xcite . however , its application on nanoelectronics is limited due to the lack of band gap at the fermi energy . a well - established method to overcome",
    "this problem is by patterning graphene sheets into long stripes known as nanoribbons with varying widths using planar technologies of electron beam lithography and etching @xcite .",
    "for example armchair graphene nanoribbons possess a gapped energy subband structure tunable by controlling the nanoribbon width @xcite .",
    "for some other celebrated examples , a considerable gap can be created by embending graphene on boron nitride ( bn ) substrates@xcite , or by impurity doping@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been an extensive searching for alternative monolayer systems similar to graphene that would be more appropriate for nanoelectronics .",
    "one of the most recent examples is transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) monolayers@xcite , two - dimensional monolayers with honeycomb lattice structures similar to graphene but with gapped subband stuctures of multi - valleys located at the k and k@xmath0 of the brillouin zone .",
    "in contrast to graphene , a tmd monolayer can be described effectively by the massive dirac equation instead of the massless one .",
    "typically the energy band gap of tmd monolayers can be relatively large , for instance , 1.35  ev for w@xmath1 or 1.83  ev for mo@xmath1 .",
    "additionally , they offer certain advantages over conventional semiconductors , such as large spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , which makes them promising candidates for spintronics applications .",
    "spintronics of conduction electrons is an emerging field due to its applications from logic to storage devices with high speed and very low power dissipation @xcite . manipulating the spin information offers the possibility to scale down spintronic devices to the nanoscale and is favorable for applications in quantum computing @xcite .",

    ", we propose a way of manipulating the quantum transport properties of spin - polarized electrons in nanoribbons made of massive dirac materials , by using experimentally achievable finger - gate potential structures @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a single impurity in open 2d quantum systems at the presence of magnetic field , may yield quasibound states ( qbss ) below the subband bottoms of the energy spectrum , which can lead to strong backscattering of the conduction electrons , resembling evanescent scattering effects @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate the role of the qbss in dirac nanoribbons under an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we show that the qbss lead to dips in the conductance , suppressing the spin - polarized electronic current of the nanoribbons , similarly to localized evanescent modes .",
    "the position of the dips can be controlled by the polarity ( sign ) of the finger - gate potential , offering the possibility for the realization of a spin - switch .",
    "the effects of the qbss can be detected in the low energy regime via scattering processes involving one subband which we identify as intra - subband scattering and in the high energy regime , via scattering processes involving different subbands which we identify as inter - subband scattering .",
    "these processes can involve either flipping of the electron spin ( spin - flip ) , or not ( spin - nonflip ) , allowing additional control over the spin polarized electronic transport via partial finger - gate structures .",

    "a simple way to generate both rashba and zeeman effects is via applying a rotating in - plane magnetic field with tunable strength @xmath12 and rotation period @xmath13 that can be achieved experimentally by nanomagnets placed at the nanoribbon edges @xcite .",
    "the resulting rashba term is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pauli matrix while the rashba interaction strength is given by @xmath16 .",

    "one is intra - subband occurring between different branches belonging to same subband @xmath60 for example from branch @xmath88 to either the maximum of the same branch or to the bottom of @xmath97 , as shown by solid lines in the inset of .",

    "when a scattering process involves transitions between branches characterized by opposite @xmath99 then it corresponds to spin - flip backscattering through the qbs .",

    "we expect spin - flip scattering processes to occur at higher energies than the spin - nonflip ones , offering additional possibilities to control the the quantum transport properties of the spin - polarized electrons through finger - gate structures .    the width of the low energy regime of the @xmath88 branch ( @xmath101 ) denoted by @xmath102 in the inset of plays an important role .",

    "this mechanism would be more appropriate for energies near @xmath110 where the electrons have accumulated full spin polarization along the @xmath20 axis@xcite .",
    "the intra - subband mechanism is not affected by the width of the ribbon since the parabolic form ( ) of the @xmath60=1 subband and the spin splitting caused by the rashba and zeeman terms described analytically by are maintained for any ribbon width .",

    "we have found that in order to distinguish the qbs dips clearly @xmath3 should be much larger that @xmath102 , which can be roughly expressed as @xmath113 in terms of @xmath105 and v. in principle , for any dirac material , a fine - tuning of the magnetic field parameters and @xmath3 according to should achieve the desirable conductance suppression which is required for better control of the spin - switch .",
    "another necessary condition is that the zeeman gap ( @xmath61 ) determined by the magnetic field strength @xmath12 should be sufficiently large so that the eqbs and hqbs are clearly separated . in general , since is inversely proportional to v , dirac materials with large gaps like tmd monolayers require smaller @xmath3 than materials with smaller gaps , like graphene on bn substrates .",

    "<S> we investigate the quantum transport properties of multichannel nanoribbons made of materials described by the dirac equation , under an in - plane magnetic field . in the low energy regime , </S>",
    "<S> positive and negative finger - gate potentials allow the electrons to make intra - subband transitions via hole - like or electron - like quasibound states ( qbs ) , respectively , resulting in dips in the conductance . in the high energy regime , </S>",
    "<S> double dip structures in the conductance are found , attributed to spin - flip or spin - nonflip inter - subband transitions through the qbss . inverting the finger - gate polarity offers the possibility to manipulate the spin polarized electronic transport to achieve a controlled spin - switch </S>"
