    "in the following we describe in detail our formalism for the description of photonic polarons in a bec . from the full microscopic model we derive an effective frhlich polaron hamiltonian for the long - lived dsps .      the starting point for our analysis is the 3d hamiltonian describing free bosonic atoms of mass @xmath86 in their three internal states @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , as well as the light - field , the atom - light interactions and inter - particle scattering , @xmath87 in the absence of interactions between the atoms , the excitations of interest are described by @xmath88 where we made use of a rotating frame oscillating with the frequencies of the optical fields @xmath89 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we introduced the one and two - photon detunings @xmath90 and @xmath11 which determine the energies of the atomic states in the rotating frame , see fig .",
    "2 ( a ) in the main text .",
    "moreover we introduced the decay rate @xmath10 of the excited atomic state , and the cavity loss rate @xmath43 .    in eq .",
    "we consider a single longitudinal optical mode of the cavity .",
    "the corresponding mode function for a fabry - perot resonator is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the length of the cavity and @xmath17 the longitudinal wavenumber of the mode .",
    "the dynamics of photons in this mode , @xmath93 is determined by the transverse part @xmath21 only .",
    "the effective transverse photon mass is @xmath94 with @xmath13 denoting the vacuum speed of light .",
    "similarly , the atoms are trapped inside the cavity and we assume that they are confined to the lowest mode of a strong axial potential @xmath95 ( created e.g. by additional laser beams ) .",
    "their annihilation operators can thus be written as @xmath96 where the normalized longitudinal mode functions @xmath97 are determined by the ground state solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath98 . by integrating out the longitudinal direction @xmath99",
    ", we obtain an effective two - dimensional model , @xmath100 where we chose a frame rotating with the additional frequency @xmath101 .",
    "the interactions of the atomic states with the cavity light field @xmath89 and the classical control field @xmath26 , see fig . 2 ( a ) in the main text , are described by @xmath102 we already eliminated the longitudinal degrees of freedom in this expression , as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "this results in an effective two - dimensional coupling constant , @xmath103 with @xmath104 being the vacuum rabi - frequency of the @xmath25 transition . we assume here that the cavity mode has no coherent amplitude , i.e. @xmath105 . the following analysis can be generalized to the case when a finite amplitude @xmath106 is present corresponding to @xmath107",
    ". we will remark on the effects of this at the end of this section .",
    "the atomic interactions read @xmath108 again after the elimination of longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "the effective two - dimensional interaction strengths are given by @xmath109 .",
    "to simplify the hamiltonian we first treat only its quadratic part , coupling the matter fields @xmath110 .",
    "we start by considering the case when both the one and two - photon detunings @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the free hamiltonian vanish , @xmath113 .",
    "we assume that a macroscopic number of atoms is initially prepared in the system .",
    "they are optically pumped into the atomic ground state @xmath114 on a time scale @xmath115 .",
    "when being cooled down they condense in the ground state and form a bec , provided the thermalization rate is sufficiently large .",
    "next we describe the macroscopic condensate of @xmath32 atoms in the ground state using standard bogoliubov theory , see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "we can now write @xmath116 and as a result the effective hamiltonian for ground - state atoms becomes @xmath117 . here",
    "@xmath36 annihilates a bogoliubov phonon with momentum @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the macroscopic ground state energy of the bec .",
    "@xmath31 denotes the linear system size in transverse direction .",
    "the bogoliubov form factors are given by @xmath120 where @xmath30 is the two - dimensional density of the bec .",
    "now we replace the ground state field operator @xmath121 in terms of the condensate fraction @xmath122 and the bogoliubov phonons @xmath36 using eq .. quantum fluctuations in the system , including the impurity , are thus described by the field operators @xmath36 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 . before treating their mutual ( non - linear ) interactions , which give rise to the effective frhlich hamiltonian",
    ", we discuss terms in the hamiltonian which are quadratic in these quantum fluctuations .",
    "we obtain @xmath126 where we introduced the chemical potential @xmath127 of the bec .",
    "now we solve @xmath128 approximately by introducing dark ( @xmath129 ) and bright ( @xmath38 ) state polaritons , @xmath130 with the atom - light mixing angle being defined as @xmath131 the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath132 the dispersion relations of the dark and bright state polaritons are    _ ^dsp & =  - i ) ^2 + ",

    "we observe that the dsp is a long - lived excitation of the system , which is only weakly coupled to the bright polariton via @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "the bright polariton in turn is strongly coupled to the short - lived excited state , @xmath136 .",
    "therefore we can restrict our analysis to the study of dsps and neglect non - adiabatic couplings to other states ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be precise ) .",
    "non - adiabatic corrections are discussed in the following section of this supplementary material .    expressing the remaining terms in the interaction hamiltonian using the polariton basis ( consisting of @xmath129 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath36 ) , some algebra yields the effective frhlich hamiltonian for dsps interacting with the bogoliubov phonons in the bec , see eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the main text .",
    "the effective coupling strength is given by @xmath137 .",
    "we ignored all scattering channels into the remaining fields ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and neglect corrections to the frhlich hamiltonian resulting from the atom - light interaction .",
    "this is justified for realistic system parameters .",
    "in addition , two - phonon scattering on the spin state @xmath8 were neglected , giving rise to the condition in eq .",
    "( 6 ) of the main text @xcite .      in the above discussion we considered a dsp formed by a quantized few - photon cavity field . in general",
    "the cavity field may have a non - vanishing coherent amplitude @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath89 has to be replaced by @xmath138 . in this case",
    "the derivation of the effective frhlich hamiltonian is a bit more involved and leads to small modifications of the coupling constants as well as to some additional correction terms .",
    "we do not present the full derivation here , but only remark on the main additional features .",
    "first of all the simultaneous presence of two coherent fields , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , drives the atoms into a dark state of the internal dynamics , which is a superposition of ground - state and spin - state atoms , @xmath141 .",
    "the orthogonal bright state , described by @xmath142 is strongly coupled to the short - lived excited state @xmath143 . here",
    "the atomic mixing angle is determined by @xmath144 for sufficiently low temperatures the atomic gas forms a bec in the dark state @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the dark and bright state polaritons are generated by quantum fluctuations of the cavity field @xmath89 and the atomic bright state @xmath146 @xmath147 as a consequence of the mixture of ground- and spin - state atoms all interaction strengths become renormalized . @xmath148 and some new scattering and non - adiabatic coupling processes arize , which we do not list here in detail however . in the limit of a weak cavity field , @xmath149 , i.e. @xmath150 , the same effective frhlich polaron hamiltonian as given in eq.(1 ) of the main text can be drived .",
    "now we discuss further under which conditions the effective frhlich model for dsps is valid .",
    "this part extends our derivation presented in the previous section . here for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath151 vanishes , such that @xmath152 .",
    "we calculate the effect of non - adiabatic mixing of dark- and bright polaritons via @xmath134 , discuss corrections to the frhlich hamiltonian , and derive interaction - induced dsp loss rates .",
    "so far we treated the cavity decay @xmath153 , the kinetic energies @xmath154 and the effective detuning @xmath155 perturbatively to leading order , leaving the definition of polaritons unaffected .",
    "different methods were employed previously to obtain results from higher - order perturbation theory for the polariton dispersions @xcite . here , however , we are not only interested in the corrections to the polariton dispersions @xmath156 , but also in the corrections to the actual eigenstates .",
    "these give rise to modified interactions with the bogoliubov phonons .",
    "for example , when the dark - state polariton @xmath129 acquires an admixture of the excited atomic state @xmath39 , the non - linearities of the atom - light interaction give rise to additional terms in the frhlich hamiltonian .",
    "as a first step towards obtaining non - adiabatic corrections , we introduce a new basis rotation @xmath157 to a good approximation this diagonalizes the coupling @xmath158 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , because under the slow - light conditions we are interested in it holds @xmath159 , where @xmath160 .",

    "the dispersions of the new bright polaritons are given by @xmath164    now we calculate higher order non - adiabatic corrections to the dark - state polaritons @xmath129 , caused by the couplings @xmath165 . in this step not only the energies but also the basis states are modified by the perturbation .",
    "to this end we employ a generalization of the schrieffer - wolff transformation to non - hermitian systems .",
    "we define a new basis by @xmath166 up to corrections of order @xmath167 .    in the new hamiltonian , the dark - state polariton @xmath168 is approximately decoupled from both bright polaritons @xmath169 ( up to terms of order @xmath170 on the off - diagonal of the effective hamiltonian ) , @xmath171 there are no corrections to the dsp dispersion , @xmath172 , because corrections from @xmath173 and @xmath174 cancel each other to leading order in @xmath170 .",
    "( if , however , we conduct perturbation theory in @xmath175 , we checked that the same corrections to the dsp dispersion are obtained as reported previously in refs.@xcite . )",
    "finally we are in a position to calculate the effective dsp - dsp interactions . by introducing the new basis @xmath176 , @xmath168 we obtain to following correction to the frhlich hamiltonian , @xmath177 -   v_{{\\bm{k } } } \\left [ ( { \\bm{k}}+{\\bm{q}})^2 { \\hat{a}^\\dagger}_{-{\\bm{k } } }   + { \\bm{q}}^2 { \\hat{a}}_{{\\bm{k } } } \\right ] \\biggr ) \\biggr\\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the term in the first line modifies the effective interaction strength @xmath178 in the frhlich hamiltonian . the terms in the second line depend explicitly on the momentum @xmath179 of the impurity , yielding terms which are not contained in the usual frhlich model .",
    "our formalism readily yields all interactions between the fields @xmath176 , @xmath168 and phonons as well , but the expressions are too cumbersome to write them out explicitly . here ,",
    "instead , we consider only the leading - order scattering terms causing interaction - induced dsp losses ( and a renormalized dsp dispersion ) . within the born - approximation",
    "only the following two terms are relevant , @xmath180 the corresponding scattering amplitudes are given by @xmath181 where the `` @xmath182 '' ( the `` @xmath183 '' ) sign corresponds to @xmath184 ( to @xmath185 ) . from the born approximation",
    "we obtain the renormalization of the dsp dispersion , @xmath186 therefore the interaction - induced dsp losses scale like @xmath187 , up to corrections of order @xmath188 .",
    "finally we we want to provide some realistic numbers for all model parameters .",
    "we consider the hyperfine states of@xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 with scattering lengths @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 @xcite where @xmath195 is the bohr radius , which are coupled in a lambda scheme with @xmath196 ( d2 line ) .",
    "furthermore we assume a density of @xmath197 for a transverse confinement characterized by the oscillator length @xmath198 as in the experiment of ref .",
    "we assume a cavity length of @xmath199 , estimate typical atom - light coupling strength @xmath200 @xcite and use a small rabi frequency @xmath201 ( the relation to two - dimensional quantities is discussed in the methods ) . as a result",
    "we find @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "by increasing the rabi frequency to e.g. @xmath204 a much smaller mass ratio of @xmath205 can be realized .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath0 can be tuned via feshbach resonances , and we find that the frhlich hamiltonian is valid below @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) for @xmath201 ( @xmath204 ) .",

    "<S> one recognizes that the validity of the frhlich model for becs extends into the intermediate coupling regime , while going to strong coupling may require to go beyond the frhlich model . ultimately experiments need to clarify how the system behaves at intermediate couplings , and we believe that the proposed setup is well suited to explore this .

    "<S> one of the main motivations to study this system is to explore the self - trapping transition experimentally , with the impurity mass serving as a flexible tuning parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of this transition , dominated by phonon correlations , is poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical analysis presented suggests a smooth cross - over rather than a sharp phase - transition as may be expected from feynman s variational approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , experiments are needed to clarify how the polaron becomes self - trapped .    </S>",
    "<S> the suggested setup furthermore raises new questions , including how the polaron properties change in a regime where the frhlich hamiltonian is no longer valid and the formation of bubble polarons may be expected @xcite . although the validity of the theoretical analysis presented here is questionable in this parameter range , the ability to tune both the coupling strength @xmath0 and the impurity mass @xmath5 at will makes our system appealing to search for new physical effects .    finally in solid state systems polarons </S>",

    "<S> also the dynamics of polaron formation can be studied in real time in the suggested experiments . </S>",
