    "self - gravitating systems have a very particular thermodynamics first investigated by antonov @xcite and lynden - bell & wood @xcite in relation to stellar systems such as globular clusters made of classical point mass stars .",
    "a first curiosity is the existence of negative specific heats leading to the notion of ensemble inequivalence .",
    "it is well - known in astrophysics that self - gravitating systems have negative specific heats @xcite .",
    "however , when considered from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics , this property leads to an apparent paradox since the specific heat must be positive in the canonical ensemble as it measures the variance of the fluctuations of energy .",
    "as first understood by thirring @xcite , this paradox is solved by realizing that the statistical ensembles are inequivalent .",
    "negative specific heats are allowed in the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) while they are forbidden in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) .",
    "the inequivalence of statistical ensembles is not restricted to self - gravitating systems .",
    "it may arise in other systems with long - range interactions due to the non - additivity of the energy @xcite .",
    "however , the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems presents specific difficulties @xcite that are absent in other systems with long - range interactions .",
    "first , there is no statistical equilibrium state in a strict sense because a self - gravitating system in an infinite domain has no maximum of entropy or free energy .",
    "there are not even critical points of entropy or free energy because the isothermal self - gravitating sphere , corresponding to the boltzmann distribution coupled to the poisson equation , has infinite mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems is essentially an out - of - equilibrium problem @xcite .",
    "the absence of statistical equilibrium state in an unbounded domain is related to the fact that self - gravitating systems like globular clusters have the tendency to evaporate @xcite . however , evaporation is a slow process so that , on an intermediate timescale , self - gravitating systems appear to be self - confined .",
    "furthermore , stellar systems like globular clusters are never totally isolated from the surrounding . in practice , they feel the tides of a nearby galaxy . as a result ,",
    "the stars escape when they reach sufficiently high energies .",
    "this implies that the density profile of the cluster vanishes at a finite radius @xmath0 interpreted as a tidal radius .",
    "there are two possibilities to solve the infinite mass problem of the self - gravitating isothermal sphere .",
    "a first possibility , introduced by antonov @xcite , is to enclose the system within a `` box '' so as to artificially prevent its evaporation .",
    "the box radius mimics the tidal radius of more realistic systems .",
    "this procedure is appreciated by theorists first because it is simple , and secondly because it allows one to develop a rigorous statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems based on the ordinary boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , for astrophysical applications , this model is too much idealized because self - gravitating systems in nature are not enclosed in boxes ! another possibility is to take the evaporation of high energy stars into account and use the king model @xcite .",
    "this is a truncated boltzmann distribution obtained from the usual boltzmann distribution by subtracting a constant term so that the distribution vanishes at the escape energy .",
    "this distribution has a finite mass .",
    "it can be derived from a kinetic theory based on the classical landau equation @xcite .    even when self - gravitating systems are confined in boxes , or when evaporation is properly taken into account by using the king model ,",
    "a second difficulty arises which is now related to the fact that self - gravitating systems have the tendency to collapse @xcite . in the box model",
    ", it is found that statistical equilibrium states exist only above a critical energy @xmath1 in mce and above a critical temperature @xmath2 in ce , discovered by emden @xcite .",
    "the series of equilibria of classical isothermal spheres has the form of a spiral and these critical point correspond to turning points of energy and temperature .",
    "stable configurations have a density contrast @xmath3 in mce and @xmath4 in ce @xcite .",
    "there are more stable states in mce than in ce due to ensemble inequivalence .",
    "these configurations are metastable ( local entropy maxima in mce and local free energy maxima in ce ) but their lifetime is considerable since it scales as @xmath5 ( except close to the critical point ) @xcite . for globular clusters with",
    "@xmath6 this lifetime is so great that metastable states can be considered as stable states . )",
    "or the spontaneous formation of a dirac peak in ce ( @xmath7 ) is a very rare event since its probability scales as @xmath8 . indeed , in order to leave a metastable state",
    ", the system has to overcome a huge barrier of entropy or free energy whose hight scales as @xmath9 .",
    "this requires very particular correlations and takes too much time to be physically relevant . ]",
    "similar results are obtained with the classical king model ( see fig . [ ckm ] ) as shown by katz @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite ( paper i ) .",
    "therefore , a self - gravitating system can reach a statistical equilibrium state described by the king model ( truncated boltzmann distribution ) at sufficiently high energies and at sufficiently high temperatures , even if there is no statistical equilibrium state in a strict sense @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , there is no statistical equilibrium state anymore and the system undergoes gravitational collapse . ) . in that case",
    ", the system collapses .",
    "this corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "] this is called gravothermal catastrophe @xcite in mce and isothermal collapse @xcite in ce . in mce",
    ", the gravothermal catastrophe leads to a binary star surrounded by a hot halo @xcite . in ce",
    ", the isothermal collapse leads to a dirac peak containing all the particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , the result of the gravitational collapse is to form a singularity : a `` binary star @xmath12 hot halo '' in mce and a `` dirac peak '' in ce @xcite .",
    "the previous results are valid for classical particles such as stars in globular clusters .",
    "if we now consider a gas of self - gravitating fermions , gravitational collapse stops when the system becomes degenerate as a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle . in that case , the singularity ( tight binary or dirac peak ) is smoothed - out and replaced by a compact object which is a completely degenerate `` fermion ball '' similar to a white dwarf star . at finite temperature , this compact object is surrounded by a dilute atmosphere ( vapor ) so that the whole configuration has a `` core - halo '' structure .",
    "therefore , when quantum mechanics is properly accounted for , the system is stabilized against gravitational collapse . in that case , there exist an equilibrium state for any accessible value of energy and temperature .",
    "we can therefore study phase transitions between a `` gaseous phase '' unaffected by quantum mechanics and a `` condensed phase '' dominated by quantum mechanics .",
    "the nature of these phase transitions has been discussed in detail by chavanis @xcite ( see a review in @xcite ) in the case where the fermions are confined within a box . in the present paper ,",
    "we extend this study to the fermionic king model .",
    "this extension is interesting because the fermionic king model is more realistic than box models .",
    "furthermore , the fermionic king model may have applications in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "indeed , it may provide a realistic model of dark matter halos made of massive neutrinos .",
    "the observation of the rotation curves of galaxies has revealed that the galaxies are surrounded by a halo of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the nature of dark matter remains unknown and constitutes one of the greatest challenge of modern cosmology .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is successful to describe the large scale structures of the universe but it encounters many problems at the scale of galactic or sub - galactic structures .",
    "in particular , cdm simulations @xcite lead to @xmath13 cuspy density profiles at galactic centers ( in the scales of the order of @xmath14 kpc and smaller ) while most rotation curves indicate a smooth core density @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the predicted number of satellite galaxies around each galactic halo is far beyond what we see around the milky way @xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to develop new models of dark matter in order to solve these problems ( cusp problem and missing satellite problem ) .",
    "several authors @xcite have proposed to describe dark matter as a gas of fermions .",
    "they argue that the pauli exclusion principle avoids density cusps at the halo center and solves the problems of the cdm model .",
    "quantum mechanics may be particularly relevant for compact dwarf halos . by assuming that the smallest known dark matter halos are completely degenerate ,",
    "de vega and sanchez @xcite have obtained a maximum bound of about @xmath15 on the mass of the fermions .",
    "the dark matter particle may be a sterile neutrino . in these studies ,",
    "the usual fermi - dirac distribution is used .",
    "however , this distribution leads to models of dark matter halos with an infinite mass .",
    "this prevents one from determining the caloric curves and studying the thermodynamical stability of the configurations . in order to improve the picture",
    ", we propose to describe dark matter halos by the fermionic king model .",
    "this model takes into account the evaporation of high energy particles and has a finite mass .",
    "this model was introduced by ruffini and stella @xcite as an heuristic extension of the classical king model to the case of fermions .",
    "it was introduced independently by chavanis @xcite who derived it from a kinetic theory based on the fermionic landau equation .",
    "as explained in paper i , the fermionic king model can describe either a gas of fermions ( e.g. massive neutrinos ) at statistical equilibrium or a collisionless system of particles ( classical or quantum ) experiencing a process of violent relaxation of lynden - bell s type @xcite .",
    "in paper i , we have considered large dark matter halos for which quantum mechanics is negligible .",
    "we have shown that such halos are relatively well described by the classical king model at , or close to , the limit of microcanonical stability . at that point",
    ", the king profile can be approximated by the modified hubble profile @xcite .",
    "it has an isothermal core , an isothermal halo , and a polytropic envelope of index @xmath16 .",
    "the density profile is flat in the core and decreases as @xmath17 in the halo . as a result",
    ", the modified hubble profile is relatively similar to the burkert profile @xcite that gives a good fit of many dark matter halos . in our notations ) .",
    "they mention that the profiles with @xmath18 give a good fit of the observations of dark matter halos .",
    "our approach , that is based on the physically motivated king model , provides a justification of their empirical results . ] for large dark matter halos , the problems of the cdm model ( density cusps and missing satellites ) are solved by thermal effects , not by quantum mechanics .",
    "this corresponds to warm dark matter ( wdm ) .",
    "however , quantum mechanics becomes important for dwarf and intermediate size halos . in this paper , in order to describe all types of dark matter halos , we consider the fermionic king model with an arbitrary level of quantum degeneracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the classical landau equation and the classical kramers equation are recovered for @xmath333 .",
    "a derivation of these kinetic equations is given in @xcite .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , there is no statistical equilibrium state for classical or quantum self - gravitating systems in an unbounded domain because the maximization problems ( i-10 ) and ( i-11 ) with the boltzmann entropy or with the fermi - dirac entropy have no solution .",
    "when coupled to the poisson equation , the boltzmann distribution and the fermi - dirac distribution have infinite mass .",
    "the absence of statistical equilibrium state simply reflects the fact that a system of particles has the tendency to evaporate . as a result , the kinetic equations ( [ landau1 ] ) and ( [ fp1 ] ) do not relax towards a steady state but display a permanent evolution driven by evaporation . in practice , evaporation is a slow process and it may be relevant to consider some form of confinement in order to describe the structure of the system on intermediate timescales .    a first possibility to avoid evaporation is to enclose the system within a box @xcite . the maximization problems ( i-10 ) and ( i-11 ) have been studied for classical particles described by the boltzmann entropy in @xcite and for fermions described by the fermi - dirac entropy in @xcite . for classical particles , there exists equilibrium states only above a critical energy @xmath266 in mce and only above a critical temperature @xmath301 in ce . these equilibrium states are metastable but they are long - lived . below @xmath266 in mce ,",
