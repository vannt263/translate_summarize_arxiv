    "nanoengineered periodic pinning arrays ( ppa ) have attracted recently a lot of attention @xcite . by using modern e - beam lithography ,",
    "very well defined periodic arrays of submicron antidotes @xcite or magnetic dots @xcite can be fabricated in a superconducting film with a low intrinsic pinning . the latter is needed to have in the film only artificial periodic pinning centers , which are well controlled .",
    "these laterally nanostructured films demonstrate sharp matching peaks in magnetization vs. field curves , corresponding to some specific vortex patterns stabilized by nanoengineered ppa . at temperatures quite close to the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath0",
    ", the artificial pinning sites attract the vortices very strongly and , as a result , the underlying symmetry of the pinning array dictates the symmetry of stable vortex patterns .",
    "for example , at the matching fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the first matching field , which generates exactly one flux quantum per pinning site ) , square pinning array stabilizes a square vortex lattice , while in a homogeneous non - patterned reference film a conventional triangular vortex lattice minimizes the vortex - vortex repulsive interaction .",
    "stable vortex patterns in presence of the square pinning arrays were directly visualized with a help of the lorentz microscopy @xcite .",
    "if now the vortex pinning strength in a periodic square array is smoothly reduced , we can expect that sooner or later the vortex - vortex repulsion will start to dominate over the pinning forces and the triangular lattice can be recovered .    in the present paper we have focused on pinning phenomena in presence of a square array with a tunable pinning strength .",
    "we reveal how stable vortex configurations are evolving as a function of the pinning strength .",
    "we have found the transition lines between pinned and deformed triangular vortex lattices . at certain matching fields",
    "the vortex lattice phase diagram is more complicated due to the existence of specific periodic phase .",
    "we analyzed the phase diagrams taking into account different types of pinning potential profile .",
    "the critical current in this phase is calculated and the phase diagrams are obtained .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional sample with a regular square lattice of pinning sites with a period @xmath4 .",
    "we assume here that the external magnetic field does not exceed the first matching field @xmath3 and is equal to one of the sub - matching fields .",
    "it is well - known that the regular triangular vortex lattice has the lowest energy in absence of any pinning @xcite .",
    "square lattice of pinning sites can impose its own symmetry on the vortex lattice .",
    "therefore , vortex lattice can exist in the form of at least two stable phases - pinned regular phase and triangular phase in two limiting cases ( strong and weak pinning ) .",
    "the symmetry of the pinned lattice is not necessarily the square one .",
    "vortex patterns corresponding to different matching fields were listed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the limit of strong pinning . some of these patterns we also present here on fig .",
    "when the pinning strength is small it is energetically favorable to form a deformed triangular lattice .",
    "this lattice is nonregular , since triangular vortex lattice and square pinning site arrays are incommensurate .",
    "transitions between these phases were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of infinitely small length scale of pinning potential well . here",
    "we will analyze general case of an arbitrary potential well size .",
    "the pinning energy density can be written phenomenologically as a fourier expansion :    @xmath5    in the pinned regular phase all vortices are located on the pinning sites and the energy of the system @xmath6 ( per one vortex ) reduces to    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the pinning potential in the center of the pinning site and @xmath9  is the energy of vortex interaction , which depends on the symmetry of the flux - line lattice ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    the energy of the deformed triangular lattice @xmath10 can be found in the framework of the elasticity theory , in which a discrete vortex lattice is replaced by an elastic medium .",
    "the accuracy of such an approximation will be discussed below . the energy @xmath10 ( per one vortex ) is given by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the energy of an ideal triangular flux - line lattice , @xmath13 is the pinning energy , and @xmath14  is the energy related to the lattice distortion . to find @xmath15 and @xmath14",
    "we should calculate first the deviations of vortices from their positions in triangular lattice .",
    "we introduce two - dimensional vector of deviation of the elastic medium @xmath16 . for @xmath15 and @xmath14",
    "we have @xcite :    @xmath17 , \\ ] ]    @xmath18 , \\ ] ]    where the integration is performed over the area @xmath19 of the sample , @xmath20 is the area of the unit cell of vortex lattice , and @xmath21 is the pinning force acting on a vortex . in eq . (",
    "5 ) we took into account only the first term in the energy expansion with respect to @xmath16 .    the deformation @xmath16 can be found by the minimization of the total energy ( 3 ) . using the fourier representation it is easy to obtain :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23  @xmath24    taking into account eq .",
    "( 1 ) one can find the following expressions for @xmath25 : @xmath26    @xmath27    these expressions give the deviations of the vortices from their equilibrium positions in an ideal lattice .",
    "it is should be noted that the term proportional to @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) disappears in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) . this term corresponds to twisting of the vortex lattice .",
    "absence of this contribution in the resulting expressions ( 7 ) and ( 8) implies that _ regular _ pinning potential _ does not twist _ the vortex lattice .",
    "note that within the elasticity theory deviations must be much smaller than the intervortex distance @xmath29 , which leads to the following constraint :    @xmath30    now we can find @xmath14 and @xmath15 from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) :    @xmath31    @xmath32    here we took into account the parseval s identity    @xmath33    the elasticity energy defined by eq . (",

    "( 11 ) corresponds to the pinning energy in the zero approximation with respect to @xmath34 . in this approximation",
    "the vortex positions are independent of the pinning potential and the elastic energy equals zero .",
    "the last term describes the energy of the correlation between the vortex positions and the pinning sites .",
    "this term is equal exactly to @xmath35 and it is cancelled in the resulting expression for the total energy :    @xmath36    note that eqs .",
    "( 11)-(13 ) are valid for any profile of the pinning potential .",
    "for illustration of our method we show the structure of a deformed triangular lattice calculated from eqs .",

    "( 15 ) and the following relation    @xmath44 ,    we equate eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 13 ) and obtain condition of the transition between the two vortex phases :    @xmath45",
    "this equation defines the boundary between the pinned lattice and the deformed triangular lattice .",
    "the phase diagram is presented in fig . 3 in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "below the curve 1 the triangular lattice has the lower energy and upper - the pinned regular phase .",
    "the transition between these phases is discontinuous .",
    "it is clearly seen that the pinning efficiency depends not only on the amplitude of the potential but also on the size of the potential well .",
    "in fact it follows from eq .",
    "( 16 ) that the pinning efficiency is controlled by parameter    @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the larger is the pinning site well the higher amplitude is required to stabilize the pinned phase .",
    "as we will see below , this phase diagram corresponds to the vortex lattice at all sub - matching fields not exceeding @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , except @xmath54 and @xmath55 , when phase diagrams are different .    at some specific matching fields the structure of vortex lattice can be more complicated . below the first matching field ,",
    "this happens at @xmath3 and @xmath56 , when pinned lattice has a square symmetry ( fig .",
    "1(d ) , ( e ) ) . in this case",
    "an intermediate phase appears with decreasing pinning strength , in which vortices in odd rows are depinned and are located in the middle between pinning sites , see fig .",
    "4 . hence , only a half of the vortices is pinned .",
    "the existence of this phase was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath57 for infinitely small potential well size .",
    "the symmetry of such lattice is close to the triangular one , and the enhancement of the pinning energy is compensated by the reduction of the vortex interaction energy .",
    "we analyze now the phase diagram at @xmath58 @xmath3  taking into consideration the existence of this state .",
    "similar to the previous cases the energy @xmath59 of the intermediate phase can be presented as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the energy of the vortex interaction .",
    "note that @xmath62 is close to @xmath12 .",
    "the boundary between the deformed triangular lattice and the intermediate state is defined by the following equation :    @xmath63^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the boundary between the intermediate phase and the square pinned lattice is given by :    @xmath64^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is the energy of an ideal square vortex lattice ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the vortex phase diagram for @xmath3 and @xmath55 and is presented schematically in fig .",
    "this diagram is more complicated than that shown in fig .",
    "below curve 1 the deformed triangular lattice is more favorable energetically , in the region between curves 1 and 2 - the intermediate state , and above curve 2 - the pinned square lattice .",
    "the transitions between all these phases are discontinuous .",
    "the values of @xmath12 , @xmath62 , and @xmath65 were calculated within the london theory at @xmath67  @xmath68 for ( @xmath69 is the london penetration depth ) . the energy is measured in units of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the thermodynamic critical field .    to analyze how the phase diagram depends on the type of the pinning potential",
    ", we also calculated the diagram for the parabolic pinning well :    @xmath72 , \\text { if\\ } % r\\leq \\sigma \\text { ; } v(r)=0,\\text { if } r>\\sigma , \\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the distance from the center of the well .",
    "in this case the following expressions define the boundaries between the triangular lattice and intermediate phase , intermediate phase and square lattice , triangular lattice and square lattice , respectively :    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    the phase diagram for this potential is presented in fig .",
    "5(b ) at @xmath76 for @xmath1  there is also the intermediate phase separating the deformed triangular and the pinned square lattices .",
    "the boundaries are represented by curves 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the main difference from the gaussian interaction between the vortex and the pinning site is the existence of the triple point , when the size of the potential well is large .",
    "we can conclude that for any type of the pinning potential the phase diagram of the vortex lattice at @xmath3 and @xmath55  in the plane pinning strength - pinning well size consists of three main regions : the deformed triangular lattice ( most vortices are situated not at the pinning sites ) , the ordered intermediate phase ( half of vortices are pinned by ppa and half are interstitials ) , and the pinned square lattice ( all vortices are pinned by square ppa ) .",
    "however , details of the phase diagram depend on the exact form of the potential profile . for some types of the pinning potential",
    "the phase diagram has a triple point between these three phases , when the sizes of the potential wells are large .",
    "in this subsection we study the critical current of the sample in the intermediate phase .",
    "we consider two situations - when the external current is directed along the @xmath77- or the @xmath78-axis on fig .",
    "it is obvious that critical currents are different in these cases in contrast to the pinned square and the deformed triangular lattices , when they are the same in the @xmath79- and @xmath77-directions .",
    "in fact there are two systems of the potential wells in the intermediate phase .",
    "the first one is formed by the pinning sites themselves and positions of these wells are fixed .",
    "the second one is formed due to the interaction with vortices trapped by pinning sites (  caging  ) . in absence of any current the second potential wells have minima at the interstitial positions ,",
    "when the transport dc current is applied , the vortices trapped by pinning sites are displaced , and as a result , the positions of minima of the potential wells , in which interstitial vortices are situated , will also change .",
    "therefore , displacements of both interstitial and pinned vortices depend on each other and on the parameters of the pinning potential .",
    "consider first the situation when the external current @xmath80 flows in the @xmath77-direction and @xmath1 .",
    "the lorentz force acting on vortices is directed along the @xmath78-axis and is given by :    @xmath81    here and below the dimensionless variables are used : the distance @xmath41 , the magnetic flux density @xmath82 , and the energy density are measured in units of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath70 , respectively . in this notation @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the magnetic flux quanta . to calculate the energy of the system we use the usual london expression for the vortex field @xcite :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the modified bessel function , @xmath41 is the distance from the vortex center .",
    "the magnetic energy of the vortex is given by @xcite :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the total magnetic field in the center of vortex .",
    "this field is equal to the sum of fields of each vortex . to describe the pinning potential we use the gaussian potential defined by eq .",
    "we denote the displacements of interstitial and pinned vortices as @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the energies @xmath93 and @xmath94 and of these vortices are given by :    @xmath95    @xmath96    we omitted all terms independent on @xmath91  and @xmath92 in these expressions .",
    "the vortex positions on @xmath91  and @xmath92 can be found from the force balance condition :    @xmath97    these equations can be solved numerically . as a result we can find the critical current , i.e. , the maximum value of the current , at which eqs . ( 29 ) still have solutions . the critical current dependence on the amplitude of the vortex - pinning site interaction @xmath40 is plotted in fig .",
    "6 at @xmath98 @xmath68 . below solid curve",
    "the vortex lattice is stable , above it becomes unstable and vortices start to move .",
    "the situation is more complicated , if the external current flows in the @xmath78-direction , see fig .",
    "for this case the system of equations similar to eqs .",
    "( 27)-(29 ) has been solved .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "we found that the vortex depinning transition occurs in two steps .",
    "first , the positions of interstitial vortices become unstable at some finite value of current , and they jump to the neighboring pinning sites in the @xmath77-direction .",
    "the dependence of this current on @xmath40 is shown in fig . 7 at @xmath99",
    "@xmath100  ( curve 1 ) .",
    "the pinned square lattice remains stable up to the value of critical current ( curve 2 ) , which is more than two times higher than the current leading to the first instability .",
    "thus , the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "7 ) consists of three regions : phase with interstitial vortices , pinned square lattice , and moving vortices .",
    "the dependence of the critical current on @xmath40 for this case is also presented in fig . 6 ( dot curve ) for the comparison with the critical current in the @xmath77-direction ( solid curve ) .",
    "the critical current in the first case is much higher than that in the second case .",
    "this is because for the destruction of the stable vortex configuration in the first case we need to suppress the potential wells created by pinning sites . in the second case - only effective potential wells created by the repulsion with the pinned vortices .",
    "such a high anisotropy of the critical current is a specific feature of the intermediate phase , and it can be used for the experimental detection of this state .    finally , we note that according to our estimates , based on the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , the pinned phases are energetically more favorable in experiments @xcite on the films with antidot arrays , since the pinning efficiency is very high in such systems .",
    "the triangular deformed lattice and intermediate phase can be studied in the films , where the pinning strength of the sites can be tuned , for instanse , by using the periodic arrays of _ blind _ holes .",
    "we have studied the stable vortex configurations in a regular array of weak pinning sites at matching fields not exceeding the first matching field @xmath48 .",
    "when the pinning efficiency is low enough it is energetically favorable to have a deformed triangular lattice , when it is sufficiently high a lattice of pinned vortices is formed .",
    "the phase diagrams of the vortex lattices are calculated in the plane of two coordinates : the amplitude of vortex - pinning site interaction and the pinning potential well size .",
    "the vortex displacements in the deformed triangular lattice with respect to the positions in an ideal one are found within the elasticity theory . when the external field is equal to the first matching field or is twice lower , the existence of the intermediate regular phase is also energetically favorable , in which half of the vortices is pinned by periodic pinning array and the vortex lattice is close to the triangular one .",
    "we analyzed the phase diagrams for this case taking into account different types of the pinning potential profile .",
    "we found that for some types of the potential the triple point can exist on the phase diagram , where deformed triangular lattice , pinned square lattice , and intermediate phase coexist .",
    "the critical current in the intermediate phase is calculated .",
    "this current turns out to be highly anisotropic .",
    "when current flows parallel to the pinned vortices rows the depinning occurs when the lorentz force suppresses the effective potential wells , in which caged interstitial vortices are trapped . when current flows perpendicular to the pinned vortices rows , first these effective  caging  potential wells are destroyed , and interstitial vortices jump to the neighboring vacant pinning sites .",
    "the phase diagrams for the stable vortex lattice in the plane of applied current - pinning potential amplitude are also obtained .",
