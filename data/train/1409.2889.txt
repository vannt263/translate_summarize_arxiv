    "success in numerical solution of time - dependent differential equations in recent decades has provided a powerful tool for studying quantum systems with time - dependent boundary .",
    "interesting phenomena like diffraction in time @xcite and superarrivals @xcite are seen in such systems with time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "superarrivals is observed when a rectangular potential barrier is perturbed by changing its height during the scattering of a gaussian wavepacket in a very short time : compared to the unperturbed situation an enhancement in the time - dependent transmission ( reflection ) probability is seen for a specific time - interval if the barrier height is raised ( reduced ) @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been explained by taking the schrdinger wavefunction as a real physical field : disturbance due to the perturbed barrier propagates through this field to the measuring apparatus .",
    "propagation speed depends on the rate of change in barrier height @xcite .",
    "the origin of superarrivals has been explained by the concept of quantum potential energy @xcite in bohmian mechanics .",
    "recently superarrivals were studied for a parabolic potential barrier in position with a time - dependent intensity and it was shown that this effect can be interpreted semiclassically @xcite .",
    "it was argued that this phenomenon can be used in secure transmission of information @xcite .",
    "we aim to consider superarrivals in some more general situations .",
    "we will proceed as follows : the occurrence of superarrivals is shown in section [ sec : gauss_lw ] for the scattering of a gaussian wavepacket by a rectangular barrier whose width increases linearly in time .",
    "then we study the effect of perturbation on the time - evolving expectation values of hamiltonian , momentum and position operators for the transmitted part of the wavepacket .",
    "after , superarrivals are studied in the context of bohm s causal theory by computing a selection of bohmian trajectories and noting the concept of quantum potential energy .",
    "section [ sec : sup_general ] generalizes the problem to the case where the height of the potential barrier increases nonlinearly from zero to a finite height .",

    "@xmath77 is called quantum potential and is given by @xmath78 where r is the amplitude of the wavefunction . due to the non - crossing property of bohmian trajectories ,",
    "there is a critical trajectory ( starting at @xmath79 ) that separates transmitted trajectories from the reflected ones in a scattering process and is given by @xcite @xmath80 from our results for the asymptotic value of transmission probability , we obtain from eq .",

    "each of these two groups splits in two sub - groups : ( a ) some reflected trajectories never reach the barrier while a few ones reach and penetrate , but eventually turn around ( b ) most transmitted particles are accelerated with respect to the static case and produce earlier arrivals while a few ones are decelerated and thus arrive in detector later than the corresponding paths for the static case .",

    "the effect of the perturbation is to reflect more trajectories and to push those that manage to pass the barrier . in this connection",
    "the quantum potential @xmath77 plays a crucial rule in propagating the influence of barrier perturbation far from where the barrier is non - zero .",
    "it has been shown that during a finite time interval the time - varying probability of transmission exceeds that for free propagation in the scattering of a gaussian wavepacket by a barrier with a height in linear increase @xcite .",
    "as the first generalization , we consider a situation where the height of the rectangular barrier changes nonlinearly in time from @xmath86 to @xmath3 as follows , @xmath87 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans_probability ] ) one obtains @xmath88 for the time - varying transmission probability in free propagation , where @xmath89 is the rms width of the time - evolving wavepacket . in our calculations we have imposed constraints @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : height_nonlinear(t)]a ) we have plotted time - evolving transmission probability for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "perturbation takes place during the time interval @xmath95 $ ] where the height of barrier increases nonlinearly from @xmath96 to @xmath97 and we have put @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in order to show dependence of superarrivals on the nonlinear coefficient @xmath100",
    ", we have plotted @xmath65 versus @xmath17 in figure [ fig : height_nonlinear(t)]b ) for three different values of @xmath100 . as shown in this figure @xmath65 decreases with @xmath64 ( @xmath100 ) for a given value of @xmath100 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "when the height of the barrier increases in the nonlinear form ( [ eq : vunlinear ] ) , the rate of the change of barrier s height is @xmath101 $ ] in contrast to the constant rate @xmath102 in the case of linear increase .",
    "thus for @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) the rate of increase is higher ( lower ) in the case of the non - linear perturbation than for the linear one .",
    "this means that in the first half of the perturbation when the incident packet has considerable interaction with the barrier , the potential changes slower compared to the linear increase and thus the kick the packet receives is weaker . as a result superarrivals are suppressed compared to the linear increase .    at the end",
    "we just briefly provide our numerical results in two more general cases : ( i ) in the scattering of a gaussian wavepacket from two successive rectangular potential barriers which are perturbed by simultaneous increase in height , magnitude of superarrivals decreases with separation of barriers and duration of their perturbation , while increases with the final height of the barriers ( ii ) in the scattering of the non - gaussian wavepacket @xcite @xmath105 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp \\left [ { -\\dfrac{(x - x_{0})^{2}}{4\\sigma_{0}^{2}}+i\\dfrac{p_{0}}{\\hbar}(x - x_{0 } ) } \\right]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from a barrier with a height in linear increase , magnitude of superarrivals decreases with the duration of perturbation but does not have regular behavior with the non - gaussian coefficient @xmath106 .",
    "in this paper we studied superarrivals in the scattering of a wavepacket from time - dependent rectangular potential barriers .",
    "we showed that superarrivals in transmission probability occurs in the scattering of a gaussian wavepacket from a rectangular potential barrier with a width in linear increase during a finite time interval .",
    "moreover , we depicted that the magnitude of superarrivals decreases with the duration of perturbation while grows when the final width of the perturbed barrier or detector distance from the barrier increases . by calculating the time evolution of hamiltonian , momentum and position expectation values",
    ", we depicted that when the barrier s width increases , the velocity of transmitted packet increases and yields superarrivals in transmission probability .",
    "we saw the effect of the perturbation is to reflect more trajectories and to push those that manage to pass the barrier by computing a selection of bohmian trajectories .",
    "we saw when the height of the barrier increases nonlinearly , the magnitude of superarrivals decreases with the nonlinear coefficient . from the above studies one sees that irrespective of the shape of the incident wavepacket ( gaussian / non - gaussian ) and the form of perturbation ( linear / nonlinear )",
    ", superarrivality decreases with the duration of the perturbation .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "larger values of @xmath107 correspond to slower changes in barrier .",
    "thus , incident wavepacket will see a small change in the height / width of the barrier during its interaction with the barrier . as a result transmission probability",
    "will not be very different from that of the static barrier and thus superarrivality diminishes .",
    "this situation characterizes adiabatic limit in quantum mechanics .",
