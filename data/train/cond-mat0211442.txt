    "in most of the many body theories of electronic systems , the spin polarization in a magnetic field has been considered as a small parameter .",

    "however , recently , attention has been focused on materials where the zeeman splitting dominates the energy spectrum , such as the diluted magnetic semiconductors .",

    "can be fully polarized.@xcite due to their easy polarizability these materials are promising candidates to accomplish spin dependent conduction in solid state devices;@xcite hence the interest in developing an appropriate microscopic model for them .    a realistic picture of the spin polarized electron gas hinges on finding an appropriate description of the many - body interaction , which has to incorporate the explicit spin dependence of the short range coulomb repulsion .",
    "in this paper , we examine these short range effects in a two dimensional polarized electron gas .",
    "the self - consistent treatment of the exchange and correlation effects has proven to be very important in understanding the physics of normal metals , @xcite but to our knowledge it has not been fully analyzed in spin - polarized systems .",
    "in addition , the relevance of the exchange and correlation effects increases as the dimensionality of the electron gas is lowered .",
    "we model the exchange ( x ) and correlation ( c ) hole around each electron by using spin dependent local field correction functions , @xmath1.@xcite they describe the difference between the true particle density and its mean field ( rpa ) counterpart .",
