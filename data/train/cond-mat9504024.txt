    "quantum phase transitions have attracted substantial recent interest .",
    "antiferromagnet - singlet transitions in insulating magnets @xcite and ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic transitions in fermi liquids @xcite have been studied in detail , and the crossover between the insulating and fermi liquid critical points in two spatial dimensions has also been studied @xcite . here",
    "we consider an important case which has not so far been discussed in the literature , namely what we call the `` @xmath6 '' spin or charge density wave transition of a fermion system . by `` @xmath6 '' we mean an ordering wavevector @xmath1 which connects two points on the fermi line with parallel tangents [ see fig .",
    "1 ] @xcite . for a circular fermi line",
    "any vector @xmath1 of magnitude @xmath6 connects two such points . in this paper",
    "we consider explicitly the spin density wave case , but our results can be applied with only minor modifications to the charge density wave case .",
    "we assume that the fermi line is not straight .",
    "we also assume that fermi liquid theory adequately represents the non - critical properties of the fermions .",
    "if it does not , our results do not apply .",
    "we briefly discuss one non - fermi liquid scenario in the conclusion .",
    "one important motivation for studying the @xmath6 case is the high @xmath9 superconducting material @xmath10 , in which strong magnetic fluctuations have been observed @xcite ; the fluctuations are peaked at an @xmath11-dependent wavevector @xmath12 which is claimed to be a `` @xmath6 '' wavevector of the fermi line calculated by standard band - structure techniques for this material @xcite .",
    "our results may also be relevant for quasi two dimensional materials such as ttf - tcnq @xcite .    in order to study critical phenomena analytically ,",
    "one expands about a mean field solution .",
    "if fermi liquid theory is a good starting point , then the appropriate mean field theory is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , in which the susceptibility @xmath13 is given in terms of the interaction constant @xmath14 and the polarizability of noninteracting fermions , @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "the transition occurs at the wavevector @xmath1 as @xmath14 is increased to the point that @xmath17 . in three spatial dimensions , @xmath18 is not maximal at any @xmath6 wavevector , moreover @xmath19 is logarithmically divergent as @xmath20 .",
    "therefore a `` @xmath6 '' transition is impossible in @xmath21 and so we focus on @xmath22 in this paper .    in two dimensional case , @xmath18 is so strongly peaked at @xmath23 that it is natural to assume that the spin density instability happens at `` @xmath6 '' .",
    "the `` @xmath6 '' case is difficult to treat by the methods used previously to study phase transitions at other momenta @xcite . in these",
    "works the fermions are `` integrated out '' and the problem is reduced to a model of interacting bosonic spin fluctuations . in the `` @xmath6 '' case the action functional obtained by integrating out the fermions has coefficients which are singular and non - analytic because the fermion response functions are non - analytic for @xmath2",
    ". these non - analyticities lead to divergences in the action as @xmath24 and make it difficult to apply the conventional approach @xcite . instead , in this paper we apply a perturbative renormalization group technique to a model which includes both spin fluctuations and fermions .",
    "our perturbation parameter is @xmath25 , the fermion spin degeneracy .",
    "the leading order of the perturbation theory is the familiar rpa approximation .",
    "the next order is a theory of electrons interacting by exchanging rpa fluctuations .",
    "we show that this theory is infrared divergent .",
    "we sum the leading infrared divergent contributions using the renormalization group .",
    "the behavior of spin fluctuations changes dramatically if their wave vectors are close to half of a reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath3 .",
    "the important parameter is @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 is sufficiently small we must distinguish two regimes in the renormalization group flow : large momenta , where the infrared cutoff is greater than @xmath27 and small momenta , where it is less .",
    "for large momenta the divergences are logarithmic ; the logarithms may be summed by renormalization group to power laws and we use the @xmath25-expansion to find the exponents .",
    "although the physical value of @xmath28 , the small value of the numerical coefficients in front of these logarithms suggests that the exponents obtained in the first order in @xmath25 are close to their exact values at @xmath28 . for small momenta , the divergences are much stronger and , we show , drive the transition first order as soon as the regime of small momenta is reached .",
    "sketch of fermi line and important wavevectors .",
    "the fermi line shown here is similar to that claimed to be appropriate to @xmath29 .",
    "the ordering wavevector @xmath1 for spin fluctuations connects two points on the fermi line .",
    "it is assumed that the tangent to the fermi line at one end of the vector @xmath1 is parallel to the tangent to the fermi line at the other end .",
    "we have also shown a typical momentum of a spin fluctuation @xmath30 .",
    "we parametrize the vector @xmath31 by its cartesian components @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the coordinate system ( shown by dashed lines ) associated with the fermi line at the points connected by @xmath34 .",

    "ii we define the model , derive the rpa theory and make a convenient scaling of variables . in section iii",
    "we analyze the fluctuation corrections and derive renormalization group equations in the regime of large momenta . in section iv we derive analogous equations in the regime of small momenta and show that they imply that the transition is first order . in section",
    "v we discuss the physical consequences of our results .",

    "we assume that the effects of the short scale fluctuations which do not become singular at the critical point can be described by conventional fermi liquid renormalizations .",
    "the leading order of perturbation theory for the action ( [ a ] ) is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) which takes into account the renormalization of the spin propagator by the electron polarization bubble , @xmath48",

    "the momentum and frequency dependences of @xmath50 are non - analytic and controlled by fermi line singularities . because the singular behavior of @xmath51 is controlled by the distance from @xmath30 to the fermi line , it will be convenient to parametrize the momentum @xmath30 in terms of the variables @xmath33 and @xmath32 shown in fig",

    "the most important of these is the transition with momentum @xmath81 which might be also close to @xmath1 in a typical situation .",
    "generally , we expect that the singular contribution to fermion polarizability comes from the transitions with momenta transfer @xmath30 and @xmath81 : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is analytical contribution to fermion polarizability coming from fermion momenta far from @xmath84 , its dependence on the momenta and frequency is negligible relative to the strong dependence coming from the singular parts .",

    "corrections to the rpa involve diagrams in which electrons interact by exchange of spin fluctuations .",

    "we begin with the self energy .",
    "the leading contribution is shown in fig . 4 and corresponds to @xmath109    the form of the fermion green function implies that the energy of the scattered electron is small ( @xmath110 ) , so the frequency transferred to the spin fluctuations is small and the scattered electron remains near the fermi line .",
    "although @xmath111 and @xmath112 must both be near the fermi line , the angle between them may be large ; thus , it will be convenient to parametrize the momenta @xmath111 and @xmath112 by their polar coordinates @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , since the momentum @xmath117 transferred to the spin fluctuation is large , we may neglect the frequency dependence of the spin propagator except as a lower cut off and estimate the large momentum @xmath117 neglecting the small differences @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for electrons near the fermi line",
    "the difference @xmath117 is always smaller than @xmath120 , so the main contribution to the spin fluctuation propagator ( [ d_0 ] ) comes from the term @xmath121 in ( [ pi_0 ] ) , yielding @xmath122 the @xmath123 dependence of @xmath124 at large @xmath116 leads to a logarithmic contribution to the self energy and justifies our assumption that angular deviations are typically large .",

    "we emphasize again that this expression is only correct if the infrared cutoff @xmath125 is larger than @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath132 is a function only of energy and @xmath114 , so the fermi velocity is not renormalized and the structure ( [ g ] ) that we assumed for the green function is not changed .",
    "note also that the relative value of the renormalization @xmath133 does not depend on the value of the coupling constant @xmath14 or indeed on any other parameter of the theory except for the number of electron components @xmath107 and spin components @xmath134 .",
    "thus , even though @xmath14 is renormalized by the interaction , this renormalization is not important for the calculation of @xmath135 and we may expect that the logarithms sum up to a power law and that the exponent depends only on @xmath134 and @xmath107 .",

    "note that both exponents @xmath149 and @xmath150 depend only on @xmath134 and @xmath107 but not on any other parameter .",
    "this can be also seen directly from the action ( [ a ] ) because one can always scale away the interaction constant @xmath14 and the wave function renormalization @xmath64 changing the scales of the @xmath151-fields and frequencies .",
    "this shows that the effective charge controlling the rg flow depends only on the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath107 and is not renormalized .",

    "8 , in which fermion mediates interaction between spin fluctuations and external magnetic field .",
    "we denote the bare vertex coupling fermions to the external magnetic field by @xmath208 .    in order to calculate @xmath212 we use renormalized fermion green functions and renormalized fermion - spin - fluctuation vertices @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling to the uniform external field is not renormalized ; this follows mathematically from the fact that in any vertex correction diagram the poles in the green function lines are in the same half - plane , so in the limit of vanishing external frequency the low - energy contribution vanishes .",
    "alternatively , one can show that the absence of logarithmic @xmath208 renormalization follows from the fact that the logarithmic renormalization given in ( [ z ] ) does not affect the fermion density of states . estimating the diagrams in fig .",
    "8 we get @xmath213 combining this with our result for @xmath100 gives @xmath214 finally , we note that this scaling regime only exists for energy , temperature and momenta cutoff greater than @xmath27 . as soon as the relevant scales fall below @xmath27 ,",
    "the @xmath0 transition becomes first order .",
    "this transition happens at some value , @xmath215 of the controlling parameter @xmath154 . at small but non - zero temperatures",
    "the transition remains a first order but it occurs at a somewhat different value of @xmath216 . we may estimate this transition line from the argument that if @xmath217 , then the ordered phase has lower energy than the disordered phase , so @xmath218 .",
    "however , the disordered phase has greater entropy , because there is no gap on the fermi line ; thus @xmath219 . equating",
    "the two gives @xmath220 we expect that at scales greater than @xmath27 the line of first order transitions terminates at a critical point , @xmath9 .",
    "we estimate @xmath221 .",
    "we have presented arguments suggesting that the @xmath6 density wave transition is first order in @xmath22 spatial dimensions . by way of conclusion",
    "we place our results in the context of quantum critical phenomena and of theories of strongly correlated electrons , and discuss some implications of our conclusions for the physics of high @xmath9 superconductors",
    ".    one may divide quantum critical phenomena in metals into two classes : those in which fluctuations of the order parameter are strongly coupled to the particle - hole continuum ( and in particular may decay into a particle - hole pair ) and those in which the coupling to fermions is irrelevant .",
    "if the coupling to fermions is irrelevant , then the critical phenomena are described by a theory of propagating bosons which may be studied by conventional methods @xcite .",
    "if decay into a particle - hole pair is possible , then in most cases it is still possible to describe the critical phenomena by a theory of bosons , albeit with overdamped dynamics @xcite .",
    "the description in terms of a purely bosonic theory is possible in these cases because the effect of the critical fluctuations on the fermions is small enough so renormalization of the fermions does not feed back into the properties of critical fluctuations .",
    "the one exceptional case is the two dimensional @xmath6 transition . here",
    "the large phase volume available for scattering across the fermi line makes the critical fluctuations have a strong effect on the electrons ; further the @xmath6 singularities in electron response functions mean that electrons near the fermi line which are strongly affected by critical scattering have a large effect on the critical fluctuations .",
    "this physics leads to apparently intractable difficulties in the bosonic model generated by formally integrating out the electrons .",
    "specifically , in the resulting bosonic model nonlinear terms of all orders have divergent coefficients and are all relevant in renormalization group sense .",
    "therefore , we used a model in which both electrons and spin fluctuations are retained .",
    "we assumed that the bare propagators and the susceptibilities have the fermi liquid form and that the fermi line is not straight near the points connected by the ordering wave vector @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath6 singularities enabled us to construct a renormalization group transformation under which we could treat fermions and spin fluctuations on the same footing .",
    "the solution of the resulting renormalization group equations implies that the transition is generically first order , because the critical fluctuations are so strong that they completely suppress the second order transition .",
    "there is one special case where the transition is not first order . if twice the ordering vector @xmath1 is commensurate with a reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath222 , then the spin fluctuation propagator is less singular , the fluctuations are weaker and the transition turns out to be second order and characterized by the exponents which we calculate in a @xmath25 expansion . if @xmath223 is small , the @xmath0 transition is ultimately first order but a broad scaling regime exists .",
    "our explicit calculations were performed for a model of a spin density wave transition .",
    "most of our results carry over to the charge density wave case , if the number of spin components , @xmath134 , is set to 1 .",
    "there is one important caveat .",
    "if the system is sufficiently symmetric , e.g. if the fermi line is circular , cubic terms ( forbidden in the sdw case by time reversal ) may exist in landau free energy .",
    "cubic terms lead to the first order transition but their presence would also complicate the analysis given above .",
    "we now place our results in the context of theories of interacting electrons in two spatial dimensions . to produce a quantum phase transition one must increase an interaction parameter to a critical value which is generally large .",
    "one must therefore consider the effect of the interaction on the non - critical state of the electrons .",
    "there are two possibilities : one is fermi liquid theory in which it is assumed that perturbation theory may be resummed to all orders . within this assumption one may show that away from any critical point the low energy properties are not qualitatively changed from those of free electrons , so the transition takes place against fermi liquid background and one may use the theory given here to calculate the extra effects due to criticality .",
    "an alternative possibility is that fermi liquid theory is not a correct description of the low energy properties even far from criticality .",
    "for example , it has been argued that in strongly correlated two dimensional models the spin degrees of freedom form a `` spin liquid '' @xcite .",
    "a spin liquid possesses a fermi surface , spin @xmath176 fermionic excitations with constant density of states at low energies and a particle - hole continuum but the fermions interact via a singular interaction which , among other things , changes substantially @xmath6 singularities @xcite .",
    "the singular interaction causes anomalous temperature dependence of susceptibility and nmr relaxation rates even away from the criticality @xcite and changes the critical properties .",
    "the spin - liquid to antiferromagnet transition has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the high temperature superconductors are quasi two dimensional materials with spin dynamics which have been claimed to be controlled by a quantum critical fixed point .",
    "it is still controversial whether fermi liquid theory is the correct starting point for a description of the low energy electron physics .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare our theoretical results to the known magnetic properties of high @xmath9 materials .",
    "for a two dimensional fermi liquid the bare polarizability is so strongly peaked at @xmath6 that it is most natural to assume that the transition occurs at @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with neutron scattering data on @xmath224 , in which strong and temperature dependent peaks were observed .",
    "these peaks are centered at @xmath11-dependent wavevectors @xmath225 which are claimed to be @xmath6 wavevectors of the lda band structure @xcite",
    ". therefore if a fermi liquid picture is appropriate , it is natural to expect our results to describe experiments on @xmath224 .",
    "in fact , they do not .",
    "there is no sign of a first order transition ; the magnetic properties apparently evolve smoothly with doping .",
    "it is conceivable that disorder due to random positions of the @xmath226 dopants masks the first order transition .",
    "however , for all @xmath226 concentrations including @xmath227 there is a wide temperature regime in which the nmr relaxation rates and uniform susceptibility vary with temperature . roughly , the copper @xmath228 and @xmath187 are inversely proportional to @xmath229 @xcite while @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "these temperature dependences are not consistent with our results , eqs ( [ t_1],[t_2],[chi_u ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the magnetic properties of @xmath224 are not well described within a fermi liquid approach .",
    "two alternatives have been proposed : one is that the fermions are in `` spin - liquid '' regime described above @xcite ; another is that the critical behavior is due to propagating spin waves only weakly coupled to the electrons @xcite .",
    "another class of materials to which our results might be relevant are the low dimensional organics such as ttf - tcnq .",
    "these materials have strongly anisotropic transfer integrals @xmath231 , leading typically to an open fermi line , but with non - negligible curvature .",
    "the curvature implies that the physics of these materials is not strictly one - dimensional and makes it possible that the theory developed here is relevant and explains the experimental observation that the spin density wave transition produced by lowering the temperature is weakly first order @xcite .",
    "_ note added_. after this paper was completed we received a preprint from a. v. chubukov analysing the spin density wave transition with @xmath232 but @xmath233 .",
    "he found a logarithmic renormalization very similar to the one we found in the intermediate scaling regime discussed in section iii and showed that this implies that the exponents characterizing the critical point he analysed differ from the exponents characterizing the general case in which @xmath4 and @xmath233 analysed by previous authors @xcite .",
