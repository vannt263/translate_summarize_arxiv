    "detecting change points in the mean of an observed signal is a common statistical problem with applications in many research areas such as climatology @xcite , oceanography@xcite , finance @xcite and medical imaging @xcite .",
    "it often appears in the analysis of time series but it has more recently been found in the analysis of genomic sequences , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "given the large amounts of data present in modern applications , it is of interest to design a change point detection method that can operate over long sequences where the number and location of change points are unknown , and in such a way that the overall detection error rate is controlled .",
    "many different approaches have been proposed to find and estimate change points , such as kernel - based methods @xcite , bayesian methods @xcite , segmentation techniques @xcite , nonparametric tests @xcite and @xmath0-penalty methods @xcite , including the pelt method @xcite . however , the approach proposed here is unique in the following two ways .",
    "first , the noise is assumed to be a stationary gaussian process , allowing the error terms to be correlated .",
    "this is an important departure from the standard assumption of white noise in most of the change - point literature .",
    "in fact , applied statisticians desiring to use change - point methods have sometimes abandoned this option in favor of other techniques simply because the white noise assumption does not hold @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that change - point methods can be devised for correlated noise , expanding the domain of their applicability .",
    "second , we use the theory of gaussian processes to compute p - values for all candidate change points , so that significant change points can be selected at a desired significance level . for concreteness , we adopt the benjamini - hochberg multiple testing procedure , enabling control of the false discovery rate ( fdr ) of detected change points when the data sequence is long and the number and location of change points are unknown . to our knowledge , this is the first article proposing a multiple testing method for controlling fdr of detected change points .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a signal - plus - noise model where the true signal is a piecewise constant function and the change points are defined as the points of discontinuity .",
    "inspired by the method for detecting peaks in @xcite and @xcite , we modify the stem algorithm therein to detect change points .",
    "the central idea is the observation that the true signal has zero derivative everywhere except at the change points , where the derivative is infinite .",
    "thus , in the presence of noise and under temporal or spatial sampling , change points can be seen as positive or negative peaks in the derivative of the smoothed signal . note",
    "that because of the time sampling , derivatives can not be observed directly and can only be estimated .",
    "the focus on the derivative of the smoothed signal effectively transforms the change point detection problem into a peak detection problem . as in the stem algorithm , the resulting peak detection problem",
    "is then solved by identifying local maxima and minima of the derivative as candidate peaks and applying a multiple testing procedure to the list of candidates .",
    "the modified stem algorithm for change point detection consists of the following steps :    1 .   _ differential kernel smoothing _ : to transform change points to local maxima or minima .",
    "candidate peaks _ : find local maxima and minima of the differentiated smoothed process .",
    "p - values _ : computed at each local maximum and minimum under the the null hypothesis of no signal in a local neighborhood .",
    "4 .   _ multiple testing _ : apply a multiple testing procedure to the set of local maxima and minima ; declare as detected change points those local maxima and minima whose p - values are significant .",
    "the algorithm is illustrated by a toy example in figure [ fig : simul ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we combined both local maxima and minima as candidate peaks , and then applied a multiple testing procedure to find a uniform threshold ( in absolute value ) for detecting all change points .",
    "this approach is sensible when the distributions ( number and height ) of true increasing and decreasing change points are about the same . alternatively ,",
    "different thresholds for detecting increasing and decreasing change points could be found by applying separate multiple testing procedures to the sets of candidate local maxima and local minima . while we applied the bh algorithm to control fdr , in principle other multiple testing procedures",
    "may be used to control other error rates .",
    "a natural and important question is how to choose the smoothing bandwidth @xmath1 .",
    "from example [ ex : gaussian ] and figures [ fig : simul2 ] and [ fig : simul3 ] , we see that either a very small @xmath1 or a relatively large @xmath1 is preferred in order to increase power , but only to the extent that the smoothed signal supports @xmath2 have little overlap and that detected change points are not displaced by more than the desired tolerance @xmath3 ( recall that the value of @xmath3 is not used in the stem algorithm itself , but it may be determined by the needs of the specific scientific application ) .",
    "considering the gaussian kernel to have an effective support of @xmath4 , a good value of @xmath1 may be about @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the separation between change points . since the location of the change points is unknown , a more precise optimization of @xmath1 may require an iterative procedure .",
    "moreover , if some change points are close together and others are far apart , an adpative bandwidth may be preferable .",
    "we leave these as problems for future research .",
