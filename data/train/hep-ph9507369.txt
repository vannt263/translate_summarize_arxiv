    "the explanation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe represents a challenging problem .",
    "although far from solving this highly complex problem , we know at least what features a theory must have to allow for an explanation .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that the standard model fulfills all three sakharov - conditions to generate the observed baryon asymmetry : c and cp violation , a first order phase transition and non - conservation of baryon number @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with the violation of baryon number ( or more generally fermion number ) in the standard model .",
    "it was discovered by t hooft @xcite as a consequence of the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly present in chiral gauge theories . in particular t hooft studied the fermion number violation induced by vacuum to vacuum tunneling processes described by instantons , resulting in extremely small tunneling rates .    in weinberg - salam theory",
    "topologically distinct vacua are separated by finite energy barriers .",
    "the height of the barriers is given by the energy of the sphaleron , an unstable solution of the static field equations @xcite .",
    "thus the sphaleron determines the minimal energy needed for a classically allowed vacuum to vacuum transition . the probability for a transition is expected to be enhanced significantly , if enough energy is put into the system under consideration , either in suitable ( future ) accelerators or at high temperatures in the early universe [ 5 - 10 ] .",
    "while the barrier is traversed baryon number violation may be seen explicitly by analyzing the corresponding dirac equation in the bosonic background fields .",
    "the lowest positive energy continuum state becomes continuously deformed along the barrier until it reaches the negative energy continuum , passing zero energy precisely at the top of the energy barrier , at the sphaleron [ 11 - 15 ] .",
    "investigating the whole spectrum of the dirac equation shows , that along the barrier in fact all levels become continuously deformed into the next lower levels , resulting finally in an identical spectrum , where only the number of occupied levels above the dirac sea has decreased by one @xcite .",
    "these calculations [ 11 - 16 ] are based on the approximation , that the fermion doublets are degenerate in mass ( and that the weinberg angle may be set to zero @xcite ) , allowing for a spherically symmetric ansatz for the fermion wave function . for the physical situation of highly nondegenerate fermion masses ( at least for the heavy flavours ) an analogous calculation",
    "is far more involved , since the spherically symmetric ansatz fails and the equations of motion can not be reduced to ordinary differential equations .",
    "( this is in contrast to the case of instantons @xcite . )    here we consider an axially symmetric ansatz for the fermion fields in the background of the sphaleron barrier .",
    "the ansatz is chosen in such a way , that it is `` almost spherically symmetric '' , in the sense that the functions involved have little angular dependence .",
    "due to the symmetry of the sphaleron the ansatz simplifies considerably in the background field of the sphaleron . in this case",
    "we solve numerically the full set of partial differential equations for the fermion functions .",
    "we then consider a set of approximate ordinary differential equations for the fermion functions , finding almost identical solutions .",
    "because of the numerical complexity involved in solving the full set of partial differential equations in the background of the sphaleron barrier , we consider in this general case only an approximate set of ordinary differential equations for radial fermion functions .",
    "we argue that these equations represent a good approximation as well .",
    "in section 2 we briefly review the weinberg - salam lagrangian ( for vanishing mixing angle ) for nondegenerate fermion doublets . in section 3",
    "we present our axially symmetric ansatz for the fermions , constructed as a generalization of the usual spherically symmetric ansatz . in section 4 we consider fermions in the background of the sphaleron .",
    "we derive the equations of motion , present the solutions of the full set of partial differential equations , and compare with the solutions of the set of approximate ordinary differential equations . in section 5",
    "we consider fermions in the background of the sphaleron barrier .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we start with the bosonic sector of the weinberg - salam theory in the limit of vanishing weinberg angle , where the electromagnetic field decouples and can be set to zero , @xmath0 with the field strength tensor @xmath1 and the covariant derivative @xmath2 the @xmath3 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath4 of the higgs field @xmath5 leading to the boson masses @xmath6 we employ the values @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    for vanishing mixing angle , considering only one fermion doublet ,",
    "the fermion lagrangian reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the lefthanded doublet @xmath11 , while @xmath12 abbreviates the righthanded singlets @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "the fermion masses are given by @xmath15    the fermion equations read in dimensionless coordinates ( chosen in units of @xmath16 ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the higgsfield matrix defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the average fermion mass and half the mass difference ( in units of @xmath16 ) @xmath23 @xmath24",
    "for the gauge and higgs fields along the sphaleron barrier we take the usual spherically symmetric ansatz in the temporal gauge @xmath25 due to a residual gauge degree of freedom we are free to choose the gauge @xmath26 .    to construct an appropriate ansatz for nondegenerate fermions we begin by recalling the spherically symmetric ansatz for degenerate fermions with @xmath27 [ 11 - 16,20 ] , containing four radial functions , @xmath28 \\chi_{\\rm h } \\ , \\label{ans1}\\ ] ] @xmath29 \\chi_{\\rm h } \\ , \\label{ans2}\\ ] ] where the normalized hedgehog spinor @xmath30 satisfies the spin - isospin relation @xmath31 the generalized axially symmetric ansatz contains the spherically symmetric ansatz , where the four functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 now depend on the variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "because of the presence of the @xmath38-terms in the field equations ( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) for @xmath39 , we need to ` double ' the ansatz by adding terms of the same structure , but with @xmath30 replaced by @xmath40 , involving the four new ( @xmath36 and @xmath37-dependent ) functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the ansatz now contains eight functions , which are in general complex and @xmath37-dependent , caused by various occurrences of the nonvanishing anticommutator @xmath45_+=2\\cos{\\theta}$ ] in the equations of motion .",
    "considering the @xmath37-dependence of the functions , the real part is even in @xmath46 while the imaginary part is odd .",
    "this then suggests the following parametrization of the general axially symmetric ansatz , involving 16 real functions of the variables @xmath36 and @xmath47 , @xmath48\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\tau_z\\bigl [ { \\delta g_l^1}(r , p)+i\\cos(\\theta){\\delta g_l^2}(r , p ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + i \\vec \\sigma \\cdot \\hat r ( { \\delta f_l^1}(r , p)+i\\cos(\\theta){\\delta f_l^2}(r , p ) )   \\bigr ] \\bigr ) \\chi_{\\rm h } \\ , \\label{ans3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\tau_z\\bigl [ { \\delta g_r^1}(r , p)+i\\cos(\\theta){\\delta g_r^2}(r , p ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + i \\vec \\sigma \\cdot",

    "the crucial advantage of the ansatz ( [ ans3])-([ans4 ] ) lies in the observation , that its fermion functions have only a very weak angular dependence in the background field of the sphaleron , as shown below .",
    "this is in contrast to the alternative parametrizations considered .",
    "we first consider fermions in the background of the sphaleron .",
    "since the background field barrier is symmetric about the sphaleron , the fermion eigenvalue is precisely zero at the sphaleron [ 11 - 16 ] , also for nondegenerate fermion masses . as for degenerate fermion masses , the fermion ansatz ( [ ans3])-([ans4 ] ) then simplifies significantly in the background field of the sphaleron .",
    "this is due to the parity reflection symmetry of the sphaleron , for which the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 vanish , resulting in the decoupling of eight of the 16 functions .",
    "these functions , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , can therefore consistently be set to zero . after dropping the number index on the remaining eight functions the set of partial differential equations in the variables @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath60 reads @xmath61    inspection of the equations shows , that only three equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1]),([eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , contain @xmath60-dependent terms , when the terms involving the partial derivative with respect to @xmath60 , present in all eight equations , are not considered .",
    "in fact only three functions occur with a prefactor @xmath60 .",
    "these are @xmath62 and @xmath63 . if these three functions are small , then the ansatz is approximately spherically symmetric in the sense , that all functions have little angular dependence . in the following",
    "we show , that this is indeed the case .",
    "let us denote the three functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 , as ` bad ' functions , and the other five functions as @xmath65 , as ` good ' functions .",
    "first we note , that we could set all three bad functions @xmath64 consistently equal to zero , if the source term @xmath66 for the bad functions @xmath35 and @xmath44 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) did vanish",
    ". then the five good functions @xmath65 were pure radial functions .",
    "let us therefore inspect this source term more closely and split it into two terms , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 if @xmath70 , the source term vanishes .",
    "we now argue that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are approximately equal . setting the bad functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 equal to zero , and neglecting terms with prefactors @xmath73 , for large @xmath36 eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) reduce to @xmath74 and @xmath75 with the proper boundary conditions at infinity we thus find for large @xmath36 for the solutions the desired behaviour , @xmath76 , i.e.  the source term vanishes there .",
    "on the other hand , for small @xmath36 the source term vanishes , since the function @xmath77 vanishes . in the intermediate region",
    "the size of the source term needs numerical analysis .",
    "we have solved the set of partial differential equations in the background of the sphaleron numerically for various values of the average mass @xmath21 and the mass difference @xmath22 .",
    "let us consider a typical numerical result . in fig .",
    "1 we show the ` good ' lefthanded functions , @xmath32 , @xmath41 and @xmath33 , with normalization @xmath78 , for three values of the angle @xmath37 ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) for the mass parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath37-dependence of the functions is too small to be seen in the figure , being on the order of @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding bad lefthanded function @xmath42 is very small , indeed . for the case",
    "considered it is less then @xmath85 , i.e.  two orders of magnitude smaller than the good functions , with almost no @xmath37-dependence at all .",
    "these results suggest to approximate all functions by radial functions .",
    "we have therefore obtained a new set of ordinary differential equations by integrating out the @xmath37-dependence in the energy density , before variation with respect to the fermion functions .",
    "the resulting equations then differ only in prefactors for the three bad functions , apart from the absence of the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath60 . in block form",
    "the approximate set of differential equations reads @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a 5 by 5 matrix , @xmath88 is a 5 by 3 matrix etc .",
    "the vector @xmath89 represents the source terms of the good functions @xmath65 for the bad functions @xmath64 .",
    "( it is identical in both sets of equations . )",
    "these source terms are @xmath90 , @xmath91 and zero for @xmath35 , @xmath44 and @xmath42 , respectively , with the source @xmath92 defined in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .    solving",
    "the approximate set of ordinary differential equations leads to results almost identical to those of the full partial differential equations .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  1 , where also the approximate good lefthanded functions @xmath32 , @xmath41 and @xmath33 , with normalization @xmath78 , are shown .",
    "the difference of the approximate functions and the exact functions is too small to be seen in the figure , being on the order of @xmath93 .",
    "the bad lefthanded function @xmath42 is less then @xmath84 .",
    "thus the exact calculation and the radial approximation result in almost identical results , and the bad functions are very small , indeed .",
    "we are therefore free to present in the following only results obtained with the approximate calculation . in figs .  2 - 4 we show the same good lefthanded functions , @xmath32 , @xmath41 and @xmath33 , as in fig .  1 for the same value of the average mass @xmath82 , but for three different values of the mass difference , @xmath83 , 0.5 , and 0.75 .",
    "5 is the corresponding figure for the good righthanded function @xmath34 . the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the only functions which do not vanish in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "all other functions , which vanish for @xmath27 , are approximately proportional to @xmath22 as seen in figs .  3 and 4 . finally in fig .",
    "6 we demonstrate the approximate cancellation of the source terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 , responsible for the fact that the bad functions are very small .",
    "let us now consider nondegenerate fermions in the background of the sphaleron barrier . along the barrier",
    "we expect a smooth transition of one fermion level from the positive continuum to the negative continuum . in the case of",
    "degenerate fermion masses , all fermion levels change along the barrier to the respective next lower level @xcite , thus only one level crosses zero , and the spectrum exhibits no crossing of any two levels . expecting the same qualitative behaviour of the spectrum in the case of nondegenerate masses , the lowest free fermion level , corresponding to the lower mass fermion of the doublet , then should cross zero .    in the general background of the sphaleron barrier the full ansatz , eqs .",
    "( [ ans3])-([ans4 ] ) , is needed .",
    "the background fields along the barrier may be taken from the extremal path calculations @xcite or , as done here , from the gradient approach @xcite .",
    "the set of partial equations for the 16 real fermionic functions of the variables @xmath36 and @xmath60 reads @xmath96    these equations are analogous in structure to the equations in the sphaleron background , with all relevant features ` doubled ' .",
    "now six equations contain @xmath60-dependent terms ( apart from the terms containing partial derivatives with respect to @xmath60 ) .",
    "these are eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ g3 ] ) , ( [ g5 ] ) , ( [ g7 ] ) , ( [ g9 ] ) and ( [ g13 ] ) . and six functions occur with a prefactor @xmath60 , these are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the six ` bad ' functions , @xmath64 .",
    "the other ten functions are the ` good ' functions , @xmath65 . again",
    ", if the bad functions are small , all functions have little angular dependence , and an approximation with radial functions only will be good .",
    "let us therefore inspect the two source terms for the bad functions , @xmath101 @xmath102 occurring in eqs .",
    "( [ g6 ] ) , ( [ g8 ] ) , and in ( [ g2 ] ) , ( [ g4 ] ) , respectively , and split these two source terms according to @xmath103 , with @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with @xmath107 @xmath108 if both source terms are small , then the bad functions are small , and consequently the angular dependence of all 16 fermion functions is small .    due to its great complexity , we have not yet attempted to solve the full set of 16 coupled partial differential equations numerically .",
    "instead we have from the beginning resorted to the study of the approximate set of 16 ordinary differential equations , obtained by integrating out the angular dependence in the energy density .",
    "but even this approximate set of 16 ordinary differential equations has resisted a numerical solution along the full sphaleron barrier . only by setting two of the 16 radial functions explicitly to zero , namely the supposedly small bad functions @xmath100 and @xmath109",
    ", we have succeeded in constructing the fermion solution along the sphaleron barrier .",
    "( note , that @xmath55 has no source term . )    without the solution of the partial diffential equations to compare with , the quality of the approximate solution is not known along the full barrier , away from the sphaleron . at the sphaleron the approximation is excellent , and it should remain good close to the sphaleron . away from the sphaleron ,",
    "however , we can at least make a consistency check for the radial approximation used , by inspecting the source terms @xmath110 and @xmath111 in this approximation .",
    "numerical analysis shows , that the source terms are indeed small . in fig .",
    "7 we show as a typical example along the barrier the source terms @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the chern - simons number @xmath114 and the mass parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 . while the cancellation of the source terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 remains as good along the barrier as it is at the sphaleron ( shown in fig .",
    "6 ) , the cancellation of the additional source terms @xmath112 and @xmath113 is even much better .",
    "this indicates , that the bad functions are indeed small compared to the good functions .",
    "the radial approximation therefore should be good along the full sphaleron barrier .",
    "let us then discuss the level crossing along the sphaleron barrier , as obtained with the approximate radial set of equations . in fig .",
    "8 we present the fermion eigenvalue along the barrier for an average mass of @xmath115 and for several values of the mass difference , @xmath116 , 1.0 and 1.5 .",
    "the eigenvalue starts from the positive continuum at the lower mass ( 1.5 , 1.0 and 0.5 , respectively ) , and reaches the negative continuum at the corresponding negative value .",
    "the bigger the mass splitting , i.e.  the smaller the lower mass , the later the fermion level leaves the continuum to become bound , analogous to the case of degenerate fermion masses [ 14,15,20 ] .",
    "for degenerate fermion masses the fermion wavefunction is determined by the hedgehog spinor @xmath30 , giving both isospin components of the fermion doublet an equal amplitude along the sphaleron barrier .",
    "for nondegenerate fermion masses this is no longer the case .",
    "let us define the up - part of the fermion wavefunction along the barrier as @xmath117 where @xmath118 projects out the upper isospin component .",
    "( note , that this definition of the up - part is not gauge invariant . ) for degenerate fermions the up - part is everywhere one half . for nondegenerate fermions",
    "the up - part along the barrier depends on the size of the mass splitting , as shown in fig .  9 ( for the mass parameters employed also in fig .  8) . the up - part dominates slightly in the vicinity of the sphaleron and clearly disappears when the vacua are reached . remarkably , the point where the down - part equals the up - part only depends on @xmath21 and not on @xmath22 .",
    "we finally address the question , how to best approximate a fermion solution in the physical situation of nondegenerate fermion masses by a far simpler solution , obtained in the approximation of degenerate fermion masses , in the vicinity of the sphaleron . in the physical case the mass parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 determine the nondegenerate masses , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "close to the continuum clearly the lower mass , @xmath120 , is the relevant fermion mass . in the vicinity of the sphaleron , however , it is the average mass @xmath21 , which matters .",
    "in fact , the average mass @xmath21 of the nondegenerate case mostly leads to an excellent approximation for the fermion eigenvalue in the vicinity of the sphaleron , when employed in the far simpler calculations with degenerate fermion mass .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "10 , where we compare the nondegenerate case @xmath115 , @xmath121 with the degenerate cases @xmath122 , @xmath27 and @xmath115 , @xmath27 . having the same average mass , the fermion eigenvalues in the nondegenerate case , and in the second degenerate case ,",
    "agree very well in the vicinity of the sphaleron . in fig .",
    "11 we present the slope of the fermion eigenvalue at the sphaleron as a function of the mass difference , for three values of the average mass , @xmath82 , 1 and 2 .",
    "we observe , that the slope is fairly independent of the mass difference @xmath22 for not too large values of the average mass @xmath21 .",
    "we have considered level crossing in the background field of the sphaleron barrier for fermion doublets with nondegenerate masses .",
    "the mass splitting necessitates a generalized ansatz for the fermions , possessing only axial symmetry .",
    "we have proposed a particular parametrization of the axially symmetric ansatz , containing 16 real functions of the two variables @xmath36 and @xmath47 .",
    "the structure of the ansatz chosen is based on the structure of the spherically symmetric ansatz , which represents its simple limit for vanishing mass splitting .",
    "this particular parametrization has the great advantage , that it leads to fermion functions with little angular dependence in the background of the sphaleron , and ( supposedly ) also along the full sphaleron barrier .    in the background field of the sphaleron",
    "the proposed ansatz simplifies considerably .",
    "it leads to a set of eight partial differential equations .",
    "we have solved these equations numerically , finding that the resulting fermion functions have very little angular dependence .",
    "the reason lies in the structure of the equations for this particular choice of ansatz .",
    "only three functions occur with an angular dependent prefactor @xmath60 ( apart from partial derivative terms ) , and there is a single source term for these three functions . since this source term is small , these three functions , which introduce explicit angular dependence into the equations , are small , and consequently all eight functions have only little angular dependence .",
    "we have then proposed an approximate ansatz with radial functions only .",
    "integrating out the angular dependence in the energy density , leads to a new approximate set of ordinary differential equations . solving these numerically , we find that the solutions are in excellent agreement with those of the full calculation .",
    "thus we have an excellent radial approximation for nondegenerate fermion masses at the sphaleron .    in the general case of fermions in the background of the sphaleron barrier",
    ", we have found the same structure of the equations as in the sphaleron case , but with all relevant features ` doubled ' , since the ansatz no longer simplifies .",
    "as yet we have only solved the approximate set of ordinary differential equations , obtained by integrating out the angular dependence in the energy density ( and then setting two of the small functions explicitly to zero ) . without the solution of the set of partial differential equations to compare with , we do not know the quality of the approximation away from the sphaleron .",
    "however , we have made a consistency check by evaluating the two source terms for the six functions , which introduce explicit angular dependence into the equations .",
    "since the source terms are small , these functions are small , and consequently all functions have only little angular dependence . we therefore argue , that the radial approximation employed should be good along the full barrier .    considering level crossing along the barrier , we have observed that the fermion mode which crosses zero energy at the sphaleron reaches the continua at the lower fermion mass , as expected .",
    "finally we have shown , that in the vicinity of the sphaleron the eigenvalue for nondegenerate fermions with average mass @xmath21 and mass difference @xmath22 , may be well approximated by the eigenvalue obtained with the far simpler calculation , involving only degenerate fermions with the average mass @xmath21 .",
    "with respect to the large splitting of the top and bottom quark masses , this suggests to rather use half the top quark mass in approximate calculations with degenerate fermions ."
