    "seasonal influenza in temperate zones of the world are characterized by regular annual epidemics for most of the last fifty years@xcite . according to historical reports , however , this annual periodicity was less apparent in the past . between 1855 and 1889 ,",
    "influenza was not widely experienced and believed to have caused few deaths in britain @xcite . in the first half of the twentieth century , seasonal influenza seemed  erratic as regards its occurrence in both time and space \" @xcite . between 1920 and 1944 there were 16 widespread influenza ( both a and b ) epidemics in the united states , the remaining eight years presumably being complete skips @xcite . in the same period in the united states ",
    "visitations of influenza b ... tended to come every four to six years and those of a every two to three .",
    "similarly , while in recent years annual outbreaks are the norm , skips by different influenza subtypes ( such as a and b ) may unexpectedly occur , sometimes with one subtype temporarily replacing the other . to add another layer of complexity , the regular seasonal dynamic experience in the last decades can be grossly punctuated when a new pandemic virus strain appears , as was the case in 2009 .",
    "understanding those factors that enhance annual dynamics , and those factors which break it up is a research direction that deserves more attention .",
    "even basic concepts concerning the competition between strains , cross - immunity , the influence of climatic factors or the effects of a country s vaccination policy on the seasonal dynamics in the large , are poorly understood to date ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) .    to help explore these sorts of complexities , in this paper",
    ", we are interested in characterizing the spatio - temporal dynamics of influenza as they occurred globally following the last 2009 pandemic . a generic pattern easily identified for many countries in europe is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] e , f , and g ( red ) .",
    "there we see the initiation of the new h1n1pdm09 ( referred to henceforth as h1n1pdm ) pandemic in march 2009 , followed by another major outbreak in september 2010 .",
    "unusually an h1n1pdm outbreak failed to appear at all in the  skip year \" of 2011/12 , given that the strain was very new , although the outbreak returned and resurged in 2012/13 . as we will discuss",
    "shortly , this same pattern was generic to many countries across europe , with slight differences from country to country .",
    "a visualisation of the extraordinary skip - year across 45 countries is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : skip ] .",
    "many of the features of the time series in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] can be explained in terms of basic epidemiological theory .",
    "briefly , when the new 2009 pandemic influenza strain confronted a large susceptible human population it was able to generate a large - scale global epidemic .",
    "this placed in motion a succession of epidemic  waves \" that followed one after the other . since infected individuals who recover from the disease gain temporary immunity , each new epidemic wave also served to build up further the level of immunity in the population . in effect , this served to reduce the number of susceptible individuals available for future infection . at some point , when the number of available susceptibles fell below a threshold level , it became impossible for a new outbreak of the pandemic strain to trigger .",
    "this explains the  skip \" year in 2011/12 in which the strain was mostly absent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : skip ] ) .",
    "the h1n1pdm strain resurged in 2012/13 presumably because recovered individuals gradually lost their immunity , providing enough new susceptibles to trigger further outbreaks .",
    "a systematic theory for understanding epidemic oscillations and skips has been developed over the last decade @xcite , which we will use to explain these long term dynamics .",
    "our detailed spatio - temporal analysis is based on time series obtained from flunet , a comprehensive global surveillance tool for influenza developed by the world health organization ( who ) in 1997 @xcite , in which virological data are documented in real - time and publicly available . when discussing and presenting the flunet data it is convenient to use the following notation .",
    "we denote h1n1pre as the pre-2009-pandemic seasonal a strains , h1n1pdm as the pandemic strain ( h1n1pdm09 ) responsible for the 2009 influenza pandemic , and h3n2 as the seasonal h3n2 strains whose original form was responsible for the 1968 influenza pandemic .",
    "we note that flunet has previously been employed to study the spread of influenza on global or large - scale spatio - temporal patterns in three other studies that we know of .",
    "@xcite studied the pre-2009-pandemic period between january 1997 and july 2006 in 19 temperate countries in both hemispheres .",
    "they identified large scale co - existence of influenza a and b , interhemispheric synchronized pattern for subtype a h3n2 , and latitudinal gradients in the epidemic timing for seasonal influenza a. a recent study @xcite that focused on the western pacific region between january 2006 and december 2010 , found that dominant strains of influenza a were reported earlier in southern asia than in other countries .",
    "thus , status in south asian countries may provide early warning for other countries .",
    "bloom - feshbach _",
    "@xcite examined latitudinal variations in seasonal activity of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) and applied a time series model to the seasonal influenza data from 85 countries .",
    "they found evidence of latitudinal gradients in timing , duration , seasonal amplitude and between - year variability of epidemics . in terms of the temporal pattern in a single region ,",
    "dorigatii _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the third wave of infection by the h1n1pdm pandemic strain in england in the 2010/11 season .",
    "they found that increased transmissibility and loss - of - immunity among the population may be responsible for this unexpected wave .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no study has been conducted focusing on the global pattern of seasonal activities of the h1n1pdm pandemic virus and interactions among different strains based on the flunet large - scale dataset from 2010 to 2013 .",
    "this is of special interest given that the surveillance scale was substantially improved since 2010 .",
    "such a study is important to aid the development of strategies for relieving the burden of seasonal influenza .",
    "understanding the spatial pattern may be useful in a global effort to reduce the impact of a deadly influenza pandemic .",
    "the activity of h1n1pdm still causes substantial attention in the post - pandemic era and has led to substantial morbidity and mortality in most years since its appearance , including 2013/14 .    on the global network of influenza transmission",
    ", it is known that china and southeast asia lie at the center of the global network and usa acts as the primary hub of temperate transmission @xcite .",
    "the expansion of h1n1pdm during 2009 can be explained with data on human mobility ( air travel ) and viral evolution@xcite .",
    "weekly time series of lab - confirmed cases ( isolates ) of influenza were obtained from flunet for 138 countries that have non - zero cases between january 2006 and may 2014 .",
    "the analysis included six different types of time series : * i ) * total specimens processed , * ii ) * h1n1pre strains , * iii ) * h3n2 strains , * iv ) * h1n1pdm strain , * v ) * un - subtyped influenza a , and * vi ) * influenza b ( including two circulation lineages ) .",
    "the number of un - subtyped influenza a is often substantial and needs to be accounted for . following @xcite , we proportionally assigned the un - subtyped influenza a to the three subtypes as follows .",
    "let the number of lab - confirmed cases of subtypes h1n1pre , h1n1pdm , h3n2 and un - subtyped a for any country in a particular week be @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "then the new revised number for each of the three subtypes was taken to be : @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "the statistical analysis was implemented in the r programming language ( http://www.r-project.org/ ) .",
    "we generally preferred to focus on regions ( macro geographical continental regions and geographical sub - regions ) rather than their constituent countries ( see figure  [ fig : region ] ) because aggregated regional data is less influenced by stochasticity .",
    "we observed that nearly all countries , especially those in the temperate regions , largely followed their regional patterns . the breakdown of countries of the eight regions used in this study may be found in the supplementary material section  [ s : region ] .    to help comparisons between hemispheres it was convenient to redefine the initiation and termination dates of calendar years in a manner that makes influenza seasons ( usually winter ) line up .",
    "we therefore moved forwards the beginning and end dates that define years for northern hemisphere ( nh ) countries to stretch from the 35th week of a calendar year to the 34th week of the following calendar year , roughly overlapping the school calendar year . for countries in the southern hemisphere ( sh ) ,",
    "the calendar year remains the reference frame .",
    "thus the skip - year ( skip - season ) of h1n1pdm is 2011/12 in nh and is 2012 in sh , see fig .",
    "[ fig : skip ] .    a skip - year , or simply a _ skip _ ,",
    "is defined as a season with an uninitiated or minor epidemic .",
    "what constitutes a  minor \" epidemic is difficult to quantify precisely . for the purposes of this study , we formulated the following practical quantitative comparative definition . if , after an epidemic year the number of influenza cases drops by more than a factor of ten , we consider this to be a skip year .",
    "we thus use the following simple measure defined for h1n1pdm : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the total number of lab - confirmed cases of h1n1pdm in that region during the 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons , respectively .",
    "the index compares the ratio of the number of cases in 2011/12 season to those in the 2010/11 season in nh ( or 2012 to 2011 in sh ) .",
    "our criterion for a  skip \" is generally that @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , an order of magnitude difference .",
    "we set @xmath7 in @xmath8 to reduce errors magnified when case numbers are small .",
    "the merit of using skip index ( which is a ratio of two years ) rather than the actual number is clear . in this way",
    ", we can remove the differences in the testing effort among countries and we can also remove the effects of different population sizes among countries .",
    "we assume that the total numbers of specimens processed had not varied much from year to year , which was true from 2010 to 2012 .",
    "similarly we define skip - indices @xmath9 , for subtype h3n2 , influenza b and total specimens processed , respectively . we argue that as long as surveillance efforts and testing policies were implemented consistently in each country between 2010 and 2013 , then effects due to differences in testing policies are removed by taking the ratio of confirmed cases over consecutive years . to our knowledge , there were no dramatic changes in surveillance effort in most countries from 2010 to 2013 ( as observed from the total number of specimens processed ) .",
    "figure [ fig : region ] panels ( a - h ) show weekly aggregated lab - confirmed cases of subtypes h1n1pdm ( red triangle ) and h3n2 ( blue circle ) in the eight geographical regions having the largest case numbers in the period january 2009 and may 2014 . a similar set of panels for thirty different countries ( having the largest number of confirmed cases ) may be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : individual ] in the supplementary material .",
    "it should be emphasised that the graphs are scaled to highlight the trends ( and also accommodate the extremely high peak in 2009 ) by plotting the square - root of the weekly lab - confirmed cases .",
    "the figures immediately identify a number of clear features . with regard to h1n1pdm , we summarise here :    * all regions in europe and eastern asia have identical trends and experienced skip - years in 2011/12 . in more detail",
    "these regions experienced two initial waves of h1n1pdm in 2009/10 , followed by a single wave in 2010/11 , a skip - year in the 2011/12 season and then a reemergence of h1n1pdm in the following 2012/13 season .",
    "the skip was more evident in eastern / southern europe than western / northern europe .",
    "although the latter experienced a minor outbreak in 2011/12 , its peak was an order of magnitude lower than the previous season , and thus by our criteria could be classified as a skip .",
    "the size of the mini - outbreak is misrepresented and appears exaggerated due to the square - root scaling . * in stark contrast , h1n1pdm failed to show any skip in northern america .",
    "in fact h1n1pdm exhibited annual oscillations in northern america , with an early and large wave appearing in the 2013/14 flu season .",
    "* central america , where h1n1pdm originated , shows a different pattern to that of europe and eastern asia .",
    "instead skips occurred both in 2010/11 and 2012/13 but not in 2011/12 ( fig.1b ) .",
    "the dynamics over these years were essentially biennial . *",
    "south america shows an irregular pattern ( fig.1c ) .      * all regions in europe and eastern asia experienced significant h3n2 epidemics in 2011/12 , which was a skip - year for h1n1pdm .",
    "moreover , apart from 2012 - 2014 , the h3n2 dynamics were essentially negatively correlated with h1n1pdm . * in northern america h3n2 tended to oscillate synchronously in - phase with h1n1pdm in 2010 - 2012 .",
    "a spatial summary of the dynamics of each geographic region has been superimposed on the world map of fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] panel ( i ) .",
    "the regions colour coded in black experienced a skip year in 2011/12 and constitute a considerable proportion of the global map .",
    "we identified 27 countries with @xmath10 and thus skip years .",
    "total of confirmations of the skip year was one order of magnitude lower than that of the previous year .",
    "using a higher threshold @xmath11 , the number increases to 45 countries .",
    "namely 18 countries have @xmath8 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the weekly confirmations of these latter countries are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : skip ] ( in latitude order ) which gives a remarkable demonstration of the broad geographic synchrony of the epidemic skip over the globe .",
    "we note that most of the 45 countries experienced a resurgence of h1n1pdm in 2012/13 .",
    "[ fig : skip ] makes clear how the influenza dynamics of many countries are strongly correlated in time and skip synchronously in the 2011/12 period .",
    "the time series in figs .",
    "[ fig : region ] and [ fig : individual ] suggest that for nearly all countries the h1n1pdm and h3n2 cases are negatively correlated over the full period jan 2006 to may 2014 .",
    "this is exemplified in the 2011/12 season where h1n1pdm skipped in most countries while h3n2 outbreaks occurred in its place . to study this relation in more detail , we tested whether these two strains are correlated across all countries in the 2011/12 season alone .",
    "that is , we asked whether countries with smaller h1n1pdm outbreaks tend to have larger h3n2 outbreaks , in 2011/12 in nh ( or 2012 in sh ) . using the skip - index , eqn .",
    "[ e : skip ] , our analysis showed that of the 108 countries which reported more than 500 cases of all strains , the correlation coefficient across all countries is @xmath15 .",
    "( without the threshold of 500 , the correlation is @xmath16 . )    for a more detailed analysis of the 2010 - 2012 years , we considered a linear model with @xmath8 as the response , and having seven different predictors : @xmath17 ( h3n2 ) , @xmath18 ( flu b ) , rank of population size in the year 2005 , rank of area , rank of absolute latitude , rank of distance from mexico and geographical region code .",
    "regarding the distance from mexico , we considerd both euclidean distance ( defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 are in terms of longitude and latitude , respectively ) and effective distance @xcite and found no significant difference .",
    "the h3n2 skip index ( @xmath17 ) was found to be a significant predictor ( @xmath23-value @xmath24 ) of @xmath8 though negatively correlated , while @xmath25 ( influenza b ) was not a significant predictor ( @xmath23-value @xmath26 ) .",
    "region code and area rank were also found to be significant predictors ( @xmath23-value @xmath24 and @xmath27 respectively ) , while all other predictors were not significant .",
    "these results parallel our observations that in broad terms , countries in the same region share a common pattern .    in this study , we have focused largely on the 2011/12 skip .",
    "however , it is evident from figure 1 of @xcite and fig.[fig : spatialpre ] in the supplementary material that h3n2 exhibited a similar skip in 2000/01 . after obtaining flunet data for the period between 1995 and 2005 ( see supplementary material section  [ si9505 ] ) we repeated the above analysis . the h3n2 skip - index for 2000/01 season",
    "was found to be negatively correlated with both h1n1pre @xmath28 and influenza b @xmath29 across 72 countries . with a generalized linear model ( the skip - index of h3n2 as the response and these of h1n1 and b and countries absolute latitude as factors ) both h1n1 and b were significant ( @xmath30value @xmath24 ) .",
    "new variants of both h1n1pre and influenza b emerged in 1999 ( a / new caledonia/20/99 and b / sichuan/379/99 , respectively ) , which possibly played a role in the skip of 2000/01 for h3n2 uniformly across all countries .",
    "it is worth noting that a / new caledonia/20/99 had been in the vaccine components for seven seasons .",
    "the new variant of h3n2 , which may have enhanced the 2011/12 skip of h1n1pdm in europe and eastern asia , was most likely a / perth/16/2009 ( http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/hpawebfile/hpaweb_c/1226908885446 ) .",
    "we made use of modern mathematical modelling techniques @xcite to fit a stochastic single - strain susceptible - exposed - infectious - recovered model ( @xmath31 ) to the flunet influenza data from 2009 until the end of 2013 .",
    "details of the model are given in the supplement section [ s_model ] .",
    "the original goal was to understand better those factors that caused the 2011/12 skip .",
    "the model fits were made for the ten countries having the largest total confirmations since the invasion of the strain in 2009 .      * the initial susceptible proportion of the population was taken to lie between 40% and 70% for all countries rather than 100% .",
    "this takes into account that many of the elderly population had preexisting cross - reactive antibodies@xcite .",
    "in addition it was found that the cross - protection provided by the pre - pandemic vaccine was as high as 19% @xcite . *",
    "the transmission rate @xmath32 was taken to be seasonal and modelled by a periodic function of time , with a period of one year .",
    "weather variations and school terms are understood to be responsible for the seasonal variability @xcite .",
    "we adopted a seven - node cubic spline function , and fixed the parameter of node seven to be equal to node one .",
    "the function is second - order differentiable except for the seventh node .",
    "thus there were six free parameters in transmission rate @xmath32 .",
    "* the reporting rate @xmath33 of each country was modelled by a three - piece step function of the following form : @xmath34\\\\      \\rho_2 , & t \\in ( \\mbox{2009 - 6 - 11 , 2009 - 8 - 31}]\\\\      \\rho_3 , & t \\in ( \\mbox{2009 - 8 - 31 , 2014 - 2 - 28}]\\\\      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] here , 2009 - 6 - 11 is the date who announced the initiation of the 2009 pandemic and 2009 - 8 - 31 is the end of the 2008/09 flu season and the start of 2009/10 flu season .",
    "this allows for the sudden increase of the reporting rate during the 2009 pandemic . for example , the reporting rate changed dramatically during 2009 in the uk @xcite and in canadian provinces@xcite . *",
    "if the infection dies out in a country after the invasion in the simulation , we introduced a single infected individual .",
    "this mimics the transmission of influenza between countries , so that no country is completely isolated . * the latent period ( @xmath35 ) of the disease",
    "was assumed to to be one day and the infectious period ( @xmath36 ) two days .",
    "* we also fit the duration of the immunity ( @xmath37 ) by calculating the maximum log likelihood profile for it .",
    "namely we fixed the duration to eight discrete values spanning from 1.5 to 7 years , and maximized the performance of the model while fitting other parameters .",
    "then from this profile we estimated @xmath37 , and its 95% confidence interval @xcite .",
    "the model essentially finds the best fitting estimates of the transmission rate and reporting ratio ( as defined above ) to the influenza a time series by maximizing the relevant log likelihood .",
    "the output of the model is a plot of the profile log likelihood as a function of the duration of immunity .",
    "for example , fig.[fig : fitting ] shows the best fitting model to the flunet time series data ( plotted in black ) from ten countries when aggregating influenza a ( _ i.e. _ , by combining h1n1/99 data with h3n2 .",
    "the inset figure plots the likelihood profile and shows that the maximum occurs when the immunity duration ( @xmath37 ) is approximately two years in most countries , which is biologically reasonable @xcite .",
    "we plot time series of the median value of reported cases for 1000 model simulations .",
    "the median values are plotted in red , while the grey shaded region indicates the 95% confidence interval .",
    "the median values sit close to the observed values ( black lines ) for all ten countries .",
    "the fitted reporting ratio is shown in the top - left corner , and the estimated transmission rate is shown as a solid blue curve .",
    "the simulations match most of the observed waves for all ten countries .",
    "the estimated seasonal amplitudes in the transmission rate are small and largely consistent across countries , which suggests that the post - pandemic waves are largely due to loss - of - immunity and its associated replenishment of the susceptible pool ( possibly impacted by dynamical resonance @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated reporting ratio is very small and varied considerably across countries .",
    "recall that in @xcite , it was found that only 0.7% infected individuals actually visit a general practitioner .",
    "if we accept dorigatti et al s @xcite estimation of gp visits ( 0.7% ) and examine all ten countries , we find that between 1/50 to 2/3 ( median 1/14 ) of gp visits of infected individuals led to positive lab - confirmations , depending on the country in the post - pandemic period .",
    "we also attempted to use the same model for fitting single strain data including h1n1pdm alone and h3n2 alone .",
    "however , when modelling a single strain ( either h1 or h3 ) , fits were generally poor . in particular",
    ", the model was unable to predict the skip in 2011/12 for any country .",
    "since the main shortcoming of the model used is that it is only single strain , we conclude that a multi - strain model that includes the interaction between the h1n1pdm and h3n2 strains is needed to capture the 2011/12 skip .",
    "we examined the synchrony pattern across northern hemisphere ( nh ) countries ( latitude @xmath38 ) for the three strains , h1n1 ( combined h1n1pdm and h1n1pre ) , h3n2 , and influenza b. we focused on the period from jan 2006 to may 2014 .    in order to quantify synchrony , following @xcite we made use of the mean confirmation time index , or mct",
    "the mct for country-@xmath39 , is the mean time of infection of all infected persons over the course of the epidemic under examination .",
    "thus , if in country-@xmath39 there are @xmath40 confirmations in the @xmath41th week of a season for a particular strain , then      if all countries have the same mct , so that @xmath43 is the same constant for each country-@xmath39 , then the distribution of the @xmath44 is just a single spike indicating that the countries are highly synchronized .",
    "obviously , the smaller the standard deviation amongst the different @xmath44 the more synchronized are the different countries .",
    "the synchrony analysis examines the distribution of @xmath44 over all countries @xmath45 ( median and standard deviation ) for different strains and different seasons .",
    "countries with no cases were removed from the analysis .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : synchrony2 ] and listed in table [ synchrony ] .",
    "we examined the nh countries and for this purpose grouped h1n1pre and h1n1pdm together as h1n1 .",
    "[ fig : synchrony2 ] show that countries were more synchronized by h1n1pdm than by h3n2 or influenza b in 2010/11 and 2012/13 . indeed ,",
    "from table [ synchrony ] in the supplementary material , the standard deviation of mct for the h1n1pdm strain in the 2010/11 and 2012/13 seasons were significantly smaller than the other seasons and any of the other strains .",
    "this may reflect a more efficient transmissibility of the h1n1pdm virus which allows it to spread more rapidly between countries .",
    "these findings corroborate what is observed by eye in fig .",
    "[ fig : skip ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] , and that the mct of h1n1 only varies by some 5 weeks across all countries .",
    "note that the median of mct of influenza b seems larger than the two influenza a strains ( by two weeks ) , suggesting that the flu b epidemic lagged behind the other two flu a strains @xcite ."
