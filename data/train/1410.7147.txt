    "on the other hand , the inflow of gas into galaxies is relatively difficult to observe , because weak metal absorption feature is expected in infalling gas with low density and low metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and the covering fraction may be very small ( less than 10% , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we try to constrain the gas inflow and outflow rate of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 by employing a simple analytic model for the chemical evolution of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is constructed based on a large near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopic sample observed with subaru / fmos . </S>",
    "<S> the gas - phase metallicity is measured from the [ ] @xmath16584/h@xmath2 emission line ratio and the gas mass is derived from the extinction corrected h@xmath2 luminosity by assuming the kennicutt - schmidt law . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the inflow and outflow rate from the least-@xmath3 fittings of the observed gas mass fraction , stellar mass , and metallicity with the analytic model . </S>",
    "<S> the joint @xmath3 fitting shows the best - fit inflow rate is @xmath4 and the outflow rate is @xmath5 in unit of star - formation rate ( sfr ) . by applying the same analysis to the previous studies at @xmath6 and @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the both inflow rate and outflow rate decrease with decreasing redshift , which implies the higher activity of gas flow process at higher redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the decreasing trend of the inflow rate from @xmath7 to @xmath6 agrees with that seen in the previous observational works with different methods , though the absolute value is generally larger than the previous works . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow rate and its evolution from @xmath7 to @xmath6 obtained in this work agree well with the independent estimations in the previous observational works . </S>"
