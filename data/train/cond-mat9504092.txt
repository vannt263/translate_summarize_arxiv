    "consider two systems containing mobile charge carriers so close to each other that the charges in the two respective subsystems feel the coulomb forces originating from the other subsystem , and yet far enough away from each other that direct charge transfer between the two subsystems is not possible .",
    "experimental realizations of such systems are , for example , coulomb coupled double quantum well systems,@xcite arrangements where a 3d system is close to a 2d system,@xcite or two nearby quantum wires . a scattering event between a carrier in one system and a carrier in the other system leads to momentum transfer between the two subsystems .",
    "thus , if a current is driven through one of the systems ( henceforth the driven system is denoted as layer 1 ) , then an induced current is dragged in the other subsystem ( layer 2 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if no current is allowed to flow in layer 2 , a voltage is induced .",
    "due to momentum conservation the two particle number currents flow in the same direction .",
    "since the mechanism for the coulomb drag is carrier - carrier scattering the drag current is proportional to the square of the effective interaction between the subsystems .",
    "the available phase space for electron - electron scattering tends to zero at low temperatures , and consequently one expects coulomb drag to decrease with decreasing temperature . at low temperatures , the two pauli factors entering the carrier ",
    "carrier scattering rate lead to a @xmath4-dependence , and this behavior is approximately seen in experiments.@xcite note , however , that there are small , but important deviations from the simple @xmath4-law ; these deviations have been the topic of much recent interest.@xcite    the possibility for coulomb drag was realized already long ago,@xcite and the recent experimental advances @xcite have brought about a flurry of theoretical works . a number of different theoretical approaches has been proposed .",
    "these include ( i ) calculations based on the boltzmann equation,@xcite ( ii ) the memory function approach of ref . , and ( iii ) the momentum balance equation method.@xcite    in this paper , we calculate the coulomb drag between two systems using a fully microscopic theory based on a linear response formula .",
    "the central object to be evaluated is the retarded current - current correlation function ; since the two involved currents refer to the the two different subsystems , we call the result of this calculation _",
    "transconductivity_. the motivation underlying our work is that all previously proposed approaches lack the rigor that can be achieved with a formal linear - response calculation .",
    "the present method allows us to identify the feynman diagrams that contribute to the transconductivity . instead of the normal conductivity bubble , we find that one must evaluate a fluctuation diagram , which is similar , but not identical , to the aslamazov - larkin@xcite diagrams known from superconductivity , or the diagrams encountered in connection with the microscopic theory of van der waals interactions.@xcite thus , all the methods developed within the diagrammatic perturbation theory are readily applicable , and one can systematically study the effects of higher order scattering processes , such as vertex corrections or weak localization , or electron - phonon interactions , or the effect of magnetic fields .    apart from the general formulation for calculating transconductivities , we obtain the following explicit results . in the limit of weak impurity scattering we show that the linear - response result reduces to the expression obtained with the boltzmann equation .",
    "we also study the corrections to the boltzmann equation formula in the case of stronger impurity scattering , _",
    "i.e. _  accounting for vertex corrections .",
    "further , we show that the boltzmann equation result , which involves the susceptibility functions of the individual subsystems , must be generalized , if one considers energy - dependent scattering rates .",
    "we also consider weak localization corrections to the transconductivity .",
    "all these effects are calculated at finite temperature , but for zero external frequency .",
    "at @xmath0 finite frequency calculations become feasible , and we present a general proof that the dc - drag current vanishes in the dc limit at zero temperature for an _ open _ system . recently ,",
    "rojo and mahan@xcite used a ground state energy argument to calculate the drag current , and found a nonzero result at zero temperature .",
    "this seems to contradict our results , however there is an important distinction : the calculation of ref",

    "systems , _ e.g. _ coupled mesoscopic rings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : basics ] outlines the derivation of the general expression for transconductivity .",
    "section [ sec : imp ] is devoted to impurity scattering : first , we show how the well - known boltzmann result follows from the general formulation , and next , we establish a connection to the memory function formulation of ref .  .",
    "this section is concludes with a discussion of energy - dependent scattering rates and weak localization effects .",
    "section [ sec : zero ] presents result for @xmath0 at finite frequency .",
    "finally , a number of technical details can be found in the appendices .",
    "the previous works have related coulomb drag to the _ transresistivity _ , @xmath5 ; our calculation , which is based on a kubo formula leads to the _ transconductivity _ , @xmath6 .",
    "these are defined as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the electric field and the current density in layer @xmath10 .",
    "these two quantities are related via @xmath11 in ( [ transres ] ) the diagonal @xmath12 s are the individual subsystem conductivities and we note that the transconductivity is always much smaller than intralayer conductivity , because it is caused by a screened interaction between spatially separated systems ( _ e.g. _ the data of ref .   gives @xmath13 ) .",
    "the transresistivity @xmath5 is a more physically relevant quantity than @xmath6 in a drag - rate measurement because @xmath5 is directly related to the rate of momentum transfer from particles in layer 1 to layer 2 , @xmath14 , without reference to the scattering rates of the individual layers ; i.e. , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the effective mass , @xmath17 is the carrier density , @xmath18 is the momentum per particle , @xmath19 is the momentum transfer due to interlayer interactions , and the overline denotes an ensemble average .",

    "we have assumed that the subsystems are translationally invariant .",
    "our task consists of calculating the transconductivity @xmath27 .",
    "we employ the imaginary - time formalism to evaluate the retarded current - current correlation function , starting with the ( imaginary-)time - ordered correlation function @xmath28 the retarded function then follows as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and where @xmath31 .",
    "the calculation proceeds by expanding the transconductivity in powers of the interaction between the subsystems .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the bare coulomb interaction between the the systems .",
    "we note that other interaction processes , which couple the charge carriers in the two subsystems , can be treated similarly .",
    "an important example is the virtual phonon mediated interaction , which may play a role in the low temperature behavior of the momentum transfer rate.@xcite    the @xmath34-dependence of the current operators in ( [ piheis ] ) is determined by the full hamiltonian @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the subsystem hamiltonians . in order to develop a perturbation expansion , we must isolate the @xmath37-dependence .",
    "following the standard many - body prescription,@xcite we transform into the interaction representation and obtain @xmath38 where the carets indicate that the time - dependence is now governed by the individual subsystem hamiltonians , and the operator @xmath39 is @xmath40\\bigr\\}.\\ ] ] as usual , only connected diagrams need to be included .",
    "it is now straightforward to expand @xmath39 in powers of @xmath41 , @xmath42 the zeroth order term leads to a vanishing contribution to the transconductivity because the two current operators are decoupled and hence commute . in the following sections we discuss the higher order terms .",
    "the linear order term in @xmath37 leads to the correlation function @xmath43 use of the continuity equation , @xmath44 , allows us to eliminate the number density operator , and to express the density  current correlators in terms of the subsystem conductivities .",
    "after some simplification we find ( for a translationally invariant impurity averaged system where impurity scattering in the two subsystems is uncorrelated@xcite ) @xmath45 this expression is exact , and it can be used to calculate the first order transconductivity for any system , once the subsystem conductivities @xmath46 are known.@xcite from ( [ 1storder ] ) we also infer that the first - order transconductivity vanishes in the dc - limit .      to evaluate @xmath47 to second order in @xmath37 , we substitute the third term of ( [ sseries ] ) on the right - hand side of ( [ piint ] ) , and find that the current - current correlation function is given by @xmath48 where we have defined the function @xmath49 just as in the previous section , we factorized the time - ordered expectation value involving two current and four density operators ; this step is justified because the two subsystems are decoupled after the formal expansion in @xmath37 . due to the assumed",
