    "cygnus x-3 is an enigmatic x - ray binary system which is one of the brightest galactic sources in the radio band .",
    "the x - ray ( as well as the infra - red ) emission exhibit a binary modulation of 4.8 hours @xcite .",
    "although the nature of the compact object is not yet known , the persistent radio emission from a jet classifies it as a prominent microquasar , and the different x - ray spectral states of this source @xcite are similar in nature to that of the canonical blackhole candidates , although individual components describing the spectral shape may be different @xcite . the long term statistical correlation among the soft x - ray ( 212 kev , _",
    "rxte_asm ) , hard x - ray ( 20100 kev , _",
    "cgro_batse ) and radio emission ( 2.2 ghz , _ gbi _ ) revealed a pivoting behavior of the x - ray spectra ( in the region of 1020 kev ) correlated to the radio emission , within the precincts of the hard state of this source @xcite .",
    "this behavioral feature , in the ` low - hard ' state , has been established as a general feature of the x - ray emission for the galactic blackhole binaries , with the pivot point varying for the various sources @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been established , from the daily monitoring of the source simultaneously in the soft x - ray , hard x - ray and radio , that the correlation time scale for cygnus x-3 is less than a day .",
    "considering the universal correlation of the soft x - ray flux with the radio spanning 5 orders of magnitude of intrinsic luminosity , @xcite postulated that it is the soft x - ray that determines the spectral pivoting phenomena which is the driving force of the evolution of the accretion - ejection mechanism in these systems .",
    "in such a scenario , the compton scattered x - rays originate from a region close to the compact object , which may be confined within the centrifugal boundary layer ( cenbol ) @xcite . at low accretion rates",
    ", the disk is truncated far away from the compact object and the x - ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal - compton spectrum , originating from the high temperature region within .",
    "increase / decrease in accretion rate causes the location of the disk truncation ( cenbol ) to move in / out , causing the comptonizing cloud to decrease / increase as well as the amount of seed thermal photon to increase / decrease which cools the comptonizing cloud more / less efficiently , giving rise to the pivoting of the wide - band x - ray spectrum .",
    "hence , the pivoting of the x - ray spectrum is not expected to occur instantaneously , as the viscous time scale of the flow of matter in the accretion disc determines the change in the hard x - rays vis - a - vis the soft x - rays , and in such a situation the delay of the hard x - ray should be much less than a day @xcite , implying the need to search for delay between the hard and soft x - rays using the long pointed observations , spanning at least a good fraction of one binary orbit .",
    "considering the fact that the mechanism of a change in accretion rate is very unlikely to be a continuous process , the individual events of such a change in the soft x - ray emission with an eventual anti - correlated change in the hard x - ray emission need to be serendipitously observed during the pointed observations , with the source in the ` low ' ( as well as ` hard ' ) state .",

    "this particular result was obtained for observations on mjd 50953.[fig1 ] 0.2 cm    in this _ letter _ , we report the detection of such an anti - correlated delay , of @xmath0 1000 s of the hard x - rays ( 2050 kev ) with respect to the soft x - ray flux ( 27 kev ) . ,",
    "i.e. any change in the soft x - ray flux results in an opposite change in the hard x - ray flux after the observed delay time scale , during the individual pointed observations using the pca and hexte aboard the _ rxte _ , in the ` low ' ( correspondingly ` hard ' ) state of the x - ray emission in the source .",
    "this type of lagged anti - correlation , we believe , is the first to be observed for the class of x - ray persistent galactic microquasars within the bounds of the ( low- ) hard state .",
    "we confirm our detection of this anti - correlated delay by observing the pivoting of the spectra ` in - situ ' during one of the pointed observations of the _ rxte_pca .",

    "the lightcurves as well as the spectrum ( obtained from the pca ) uses the standard 2 form of data ( all pcus added ) , with all the procedures of data filtering , background and deadtime corrections strictly adhered to . the basic data reduction and analysis was carried out using heasoft ( v5.2 ) .",

    "the cross - correlation shows a clear indication of possible anti - correlated delay of the hard x - ray flux.[figc ] 0.2 cm    the pointed observations of this source from the _ rxte _ were done predominantly in the ` high ' state , with the emphasis on the investigation during the massive radio flaring episodes . as a consequence ,",
    "only a few observations in the ` low ' state exist for this source and that too during only two phases , mjd 5031950325 and 5094950954 . during the first phase the electron background was high and one needs to filter the data very judiciously , while on the other occasion the source exhibited its ` hardest ' state , providing one extreme of the x - ray spectral characteristics .",
    "the binary modulation of the x - ray emission is very strong in the source . in the ` low ' state ,",
    "the soft x - ray flux ( 27 kev ) is modulated by a factor @xmath22 and the hard x - ray flux ( 2050 kev ) is modulated by a factor @xmath22.53 .",
    "this strong modulation smothers all other variations in nearly all the cases , and hence the cross - correlation shows a strong correlation between the emission at the two flux ranges ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "the details of the individual pointed observations are given in table [ tab1].[figd ] 0.2 cm    repeating the cross - correlation test for these ` low ' ( and ` hard ' ) states after correcting for the binary modulation @xcite provided very significant results , showing a very strong anti - correlated delay of the hard x - rays ( 2050 kev , pca ) with that of the soft x - rays ( 2 - 7 kev , pca ) , on five days , including mjd 50321 .",

    "the cross - correlation of the co - added lightcurves , along with the individual lightcurves ( both binary uncorrected and corrected ) are presented in figure 3 , where the delay as well as cross - correlation is established , despite the intrinsic variation in the delay as well as the correlation coefficient of the individual pointings ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the spectral evolution of the source during the pointed observation on mjd 50321 ( obs .",
    "10126 - 01 - 01 - 01 ) is shown in figure 4 , where the two spectra correspond to the softer and harder regions of the lightcurve , i.e. before and after pivoting .",
    "the pivoting of the spectra , earlier reported for observations taking place on different days corresponding to the extreme cases within the bounds of the ` low ' and ` hard ' states @xcite , is observed directly within the span of one pointed observation containing the episode of the soft x - ray flux driving the spectral evolution , and the hard x - ray flux changing correspondingly after a time scale of the viscous flow in the accreting fluid .",
    "this ` in situ ' observation of pivoting , in the hard state , validates the cross - correlation results and puts the particular observational feature on very firm footing .",
    "the strong binary modulation of cygnus x-3 has prevented any serious study on the variability of this source at times - scales of few hundred seconds to about a day .",
    "@xcite have shown that the binary period ( and the template of its variation ) has remained consistent for more than 25 years with a linear decay with no second derivative of the period . @xcite",
    "have used this information and shown that this ephemeris can be used to remove the large amplitude smooth binary variation without recourse to any derivation of phase during individual observations - the only free parameters being the amplitude of variation and the mean count rate . using this method ,",
    "we have corrected for the large amplitude binary variations and detected anti - correlated hard x - ray delays in five of the observations .",
    "the only assumption incorporated in our method is that the occasional jitters seen in the binary modulation is not due to any binary instability @xcite , rather we explore whether any residual energy dependent phase jitter and/or variable energy dependent template could have caused the anti - correlated delay presented here . in all observations",
    "we find a strong positive correlation with zero phase indicating the similarity of the template in the two energy bands .",
    "further , more than 90% of the binary variability in cygnus x-3 is energy independent ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the large amplitude variations in high phase are correlated in all energies . the anti - correlated behavior is seen in the slow varying components which is unrelated to the binary variation .",
    "this was evident when we examined the variation of the hardness ratio compared to the lightcurves .    the strongest evidence for the reality of the anti - correlation comes from the model independent spectral pivoting seen in one of the observations ( see fig 4 ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that this type of spectral pivoting at 1020 kev energies occurs when one takes spectrum at different days at different count rates .",
    "the fact that such spectral pivoting is indeed seen in one single observation shows that the soft and hard x - ray anti - correlation occurs in a time scale less than the binary period and the cross - correlation analysis reveals the delay in the time scale close to a thousand seconds .",

    "the soft x - ray flux determines the accretion disk structure , while the compton cloud within the truncated disc is responsible for the hard x - ray emission and it also drives the outflow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for contrasting paradigms ) .",
    "the delay presented in this work signifies the disk readjustment time scale which should correspond to the location of the truncation radius .",
    "the viscous time @xmath3 can be calculated for the radiation pressure dominated optically thick accretion disc as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the viscosity parameter in units of 0.01 , m is the mass of the compact object in solar mass units , r is the radial location in the accretion disc in units of 10@xmath6 cm , @xmath7 is the mass accretion rate in units of 10@xmath8 g / s ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking @xmath5 = 1 , m = 10 and @xmath7 = 3 ( corresponding to one fifth of the eddington accretion rate ) , we get r @xmath2 7 for a viscous time scale of 1000 s. thus , if cyg x-3 harbors a black hole of 10 m@xmath9 , the observed delay signifies a cenbol location of @xmath2 25 schwartzchild radius .",
    "it should be noted that the x - ray emission shows a strong correlation with the radio emission , but the radio emission does not show any binary modulation . it would be interesting to repeat the type of work presented here with a simultaneous radio monitoring observations so that a clear handle can be obtained for the location of the radio emission .",
