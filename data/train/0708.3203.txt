    "the scalar field plays a crucial role in changing the causal structure of the magnetically charged black hole . in gr , for @xmath61 a single horizon exists , but for @xmath62 a second and a third horizons occur .",
    "extremal solutions exist only for @xmath63 . in the presence of the scalar field , for @xmath64 ,",
    "the causal structure is qualitatively the same as in the general theory . for @xmath65",
    ", however , the scalar field changes the causal structure significantly and the number of horizons reduces to one .    for the electrically charged case in gr extremal solutions exist for all values of @xmath66 .",
    "an inner horizon emerges for @xmath67 , where    @xmath68    again , in the electrically charged case with the presence of the scalar field the black hole has a single horizon , namely the event horizon .",
    "the existence of extremal solutions is possible only for theories in which @xmath38 turns to zero on the horizon .",
    "this can be easily proved through eq.([phianl ] ) . for the extreme solution @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the lhs of ( [ phianl ] ) turns to zero on the horizon . since relation ( [ edham ] ) holds and @xmath35 , the only chance that the rhs of the solution turns to zero is @xmath70=0 $ ] .",
    "the nonlinear systems ( [ magndelta])-([magnphi ] ) and ( [ eldelta])-([elphi ] ) are inextricably coupled and the event horizon @xmath71 is _ a priori _ unknown boundary . in order to be solved , they are recast as a equivalent first order systems of ordinary differential equations . following the physical assumptions of the matter under consideration the asymptotic boundary conditions are set , i.e. , @xmath72 @xmath73 at the horizon both the relationship @xmath74 and the regularization condition @xmath75\\right\\}\\right|_{r = r_h}\\ ] ] must be held . supplying the governing equations ( [ eldelta])-([elphi ] ) with the above five conditions we compose well - posed boundary - value problem ( bvp ) for functions @xmath59 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 as well as the spectral parameter @xmath71 .",
    "we treat it by the continuous analog of newton method ( see , for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . after an appropriate linearization we render the original bvp to solving a vector two - point bvp . on a discrete level sparse ( almost diagonal ) linear algebraic systems with regard to increments of sought functions @xmath59 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 have to be inverted .    for our numerical solution",
    "we have considered theories with constant coupling parameter , which correspond to the brans - dicke theory .",
    "so the coupling function has the following form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a positive constant and in this theory @xmath80 .",
    "we have studied the parametric space for fixed value of the coupling parameter @xmath81 ( this value is close to the one established on the bases of experimental data ) and for several values of the magnetic charge .      for regions where the ratio @xmath82 is considerably less than the critical value @xmath83 the behavior of the solutions",
    "resembles that the gr case .",
    "when we decrease the mass for a fixed value of @xmath42 , however , the solutions starts to deviate from it considerably .",
    "in gr the solutions pass through an extremal black hole @xcite . in the case",
    "we consider , the absolute value of the scalar field rises considerably and prevents the emergence of a degenerate horizon ( see fig.([phim ] ) ) .",
    "the numerical investigations also reveal that as the mass approaches zero , the radius of the black hole approaches a constant value , which means that solutions with negative masses and finite radius of the event horizon exist fig.([rhm ] ) .",
    "the temperature of the magnetically charged black hole is shown in fig.([tmagn ] ) . as it can be seen in fig.([uvelt ] ) , which is a magnification of the flat region of the curves in fig.([tmagn ] ) , when the mass @xmath84 approaches the critical value , the temperature decreases but rises suddenly before it reaches the zero .",
    "so an extremal solution is not reached .      as in the magnetically charged black hole in the electrically charged one",
    "the causal structure is simpler than in the corresponding solution in gr . instead of having an inner and outer horizon , which merge in a single degenerate horizon for some value of the mass , as in the gr case",
    ", the electrically charged black hole has a single horizon .",
    "the properties of the electrically charged black hole , however , differ significantly from those of the magnetically charged case .",
    "the radius of the electrically charged black hole decreases with the decrease of its mass , and solutions with negative masses do not exist ( see fig.([rhel ] ) ) .",
    "the behavior of the temperature , however , is complex as this can be seen in fig.([tel ] ) . due to numerical difficulties which arise in this region of the parametric space , some of the curves are incomplete . according to the curves we have obtained , for some values of the electrical charge @xmath85 the temperature approaches zero .",
    "a possibility exists , that with the decrease of the mass the temperature passes through a local minimum and then increases to infinity similarly to the magnetically charged case . to answer this question",
    "we should carry out some analytical investigations . in cases of low mass",
    "the radius of the black hole is small which allows us to make an approximation in the equations by leaving only the leading terms on the rhs . from the approximate system",
    "the following relation can be derived @xmath86=c,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is an arbitrary positive constant . on the horizon",
    "this relation takes the following form @xmath88 hence , for the temperature of the electrically charged black hole we obtain @xmath89 from where we can say that it rises to infinity as @xmath37 and @xmath84 approach zero , for all values of the parameters .",
    "for the solution we study the first law ( fl ) of thermodynamics holds .",
    "it is naturally connected with the einstein frame as this can be seen below .",
    "the formal derivation of the fl of black hole thermodynamics for the case of non - linear electrodynamics including the presence of a scalar field , in the einstein frame , can be seen in the work of rasheed @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the fl in the jordan frame requires proper definition of the thermodynamic variables .",
    "the temperature of the event horizon is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric that are unity at infinity @xcite .",
    "the properly defined entropy is also preserved under conformal transformations . in the einstein frame ,",
    "the entropy of the black hole is one forth of the horizon area . in the jordan frame , however , this is not so @xcite and the definition of the entropy needs to be generalized as follows : @xmath90 using relation ( [ conf ] ) we find that @xmath91 in the last two equations quantities @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the determinants of the induced metrics on the horizon in the jordan and in the einstein frame , respectively .",
    "the presence of the scalar field adds a term @xmath94 in the fl , where @xmath95 is the scalar field charge and @xmath96 is the variation of the asymptotic value of the scalar field .",
    "we define the scalar field charge as @xmath97 this charge , however , is not independent .",
    "let us integrate eq.([phianl ] ) from the radius of the horizon to infinity .",
    "we obtain @xmath98dr.\\ ] ] hence , we see that the scalar field charge can be determined unambiguously once the mass and the magnetic charge of the black hole and the asymptotic value of the scalar field at infinity are known . in our case , since the scalar field is fixed and vanishing at infinity the term coming from the scalar field disappears .",
    "scalar - tensor theories of gravity violate the strong equivalence principle .",
    "this results in the appearance of three different possible masses as a measure of the total energy of the compact objects . in both conformal frames in the fl of thermodynamics the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass from the einstein frame should be used .",
    "similarly , for boson and fermion stars the proper measure for the energy of the system is again the adm mass in the einstein frame @xmath84 . for more details on the subject",
    "we would refer the reader to the works @xcite .",
    "the adm masses in both frames are not equivalent .",
    "the adm mass in the jordan frame @xmath99 is related to the adm mass in the einstein frame @xmath84 , and the scalar field charge @xmath100 in the following way    @xmath101    it can be interpreted as the keplerian mass of the black hole .",
    "the terms in fl connected with the magnetic and the electric charges , respectively also remain invariant with the transition between the two conformal frames .    to sum up , the properly defined fl looks in the same way in both conformal frames .",
    "its explicit form for the magnetically charged case and for the electrically charged case , respectively , is presented below .      in the magnetically charged case",
    "the fl of thermodynamics is @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath42 are the temperature , the entropy , and the magnetic charge of the black hole .",
    "the quantity @xmath105 conjugate to the magnetic charge is the potential of the magnetic field which is given by the following definition @xmath106 on the other hand the magnetic field is defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 @xmath109 is the killing vector generating time translations and `` @xmath7 '' is the hodge star operator .      in the electrically charged case",
    "the fl of black hole thermodynamics takes the following form @xmath110 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath85 are the temperature , the entropy , and the electric charge of the black hole .",

    "in the present work numerical solutions describing charged black holes coupled to non - linear electrodynamics in the scalar - tensor theories with massless scalar field were found .",
