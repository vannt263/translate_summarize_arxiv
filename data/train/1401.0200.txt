    "wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) consists of energy constrained sensor nodes having limited sensing range , communication range , processing power and battery .",
    "the sensors generally follow different hop - by - hop ad - hoc data gathering protocols to gather data and communicate .",
    "the sensors can sense the information whichever lies in its sensing range using rf - id ( radio frequency identification ) .",
    "the sensed data can be communicated to another sensor node which lies within communication range of the sender .",
    "the gathered data finally reaches the base station which may be hops apart from any sensor .",
    "since sensor transceivers are omni - directional , we assume the sensing and communication ranges as spheres of certain radii .",
    "the network is called homogeneous when all the sensors have the same radii and heterogeneous otherwise .",
    "coverage of a certain foi and deployment of sensors are an issue of research where the aim is to make energy efficient networks .",
    "sensor deployment and coverage in 2d requires simpler strategies and protocols as compared to 3d .",
    "3d sensor network is used generally for underwater sensor surveillance , floating lightweight sensors in air and space , air and water pollution monitoring , forest monitoring , any other possible 3d deployments etc .",
    "real life applications of wsns are mostly confined to 3d environments .",
    "the term @xmath1-coverage in 3d is used to describe a scenario in which the sensors are deployed in such a way that @xmath1 sensors cover a common region .",
    "more precisely , a point in 3d is said to be @xmath1-covered if it lies in the region that is common to the sensing spheres of @xmath1-sensors , @xmath1 being termed as degree of coverage .",
    "indeed , the ultimate aim of this project is to * come up with a deployment strategy for sensors that guarantees @xmath1-coverage of a given 3-dimensional field of interest ( foi ) for large values of @xmath1*. a first step to address this issue is to come up with a 3-dimensional convex body ( tile ) that is guaranteed to be @xmath1-covered by a certain arrangement of @xmath1 ( or more ) sensors , and then fill the foi with non overlapping copies of that shape by repeating the same arrangement .    the term sixsoid has been coined in this paper to signify a geometrical shape that resembles a super - ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "sixsoid is created by the intersection of six sensors , each having the same sensing radius , which are placed on the six face centers of a cube of side length @xmath2 where @xmath2 is the radius of the sensing spheres .",
    "we compare the implications of this convex body with the previously proposed model on 3d @xmath1-coverage based on reuleaux tetrahedron .",
    "recall that the reuleaux tetrahedron , is created by the intersection of four spheres placed on the vertices of a regular tetrahedron of side length @xmath2 . in an attempt to guarantee 4-coverage of the given field",
    ", @xcite considers a scenario in which four sensors are placed on the vertices of a regular tetrahedron of side length equal to the sensing radius @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that the volume of of a reuleaux tetrahedron constructed out of a regular tetrahedron of side length @xmath2 is approximately @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to obtain a tiling of the 3d space with non - overlapping copies of reuleaux tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "in fact , such a tiling is not possible even with a tetrahedron @xcite . in @xcite a plausible deployment strategy is hinted that exploits this construction by overlapping two reuleaux tetrahedrons , gluing them at a common tetrahedron s face , but this deployment does nt seem to be pragmatic . in this paper , we propose another 3d solid ( the sixsoid ) for this purpose and an extremely pragmatic deployment strategy . we show that using our deployment strategy one is guaranteed to have 6-coverage of approximately 68.5% and 4-coverage of 100% of a given 3d polycubical field of interest which is a significant improvement over the gurantees provided in @xcite .",
    "there are relatively fewer works done to address the problem of 3d @xmath1-coverage as compared to the 2d version of the problem . in @xcite",
    "the authors make significant progress on this problem .",
    "they discuss the relevance of reuleaux tetrahedron in various issues dealing with connectivity and @xmath1-coverage in 3d .",
    "prior to that the following works disscuss the 3d version ; in @xcite , authors propose a coverage optimization algorithm based on sampling for 3d underwater wsns .",
    "@xcite proposes an optimal polynomial time algorithm based on voronoi diagram and graph search algorithms , in @xcite authors suggest algorithms to ensure @xmath1-coverage of every point in a field where sensors may have same or different sensing radii , @xcite defines the minimum number of sensors for @xmath1-coverage with a probability value , @xcite studies the effect of sensing radius on the probability of @xmath1-coverage , @xcite proposes an optimal deployment strategy to deal with full coverage and 2-connectivity , @xcite brought forward a sensor placement model based on voronoi structure to cover a 3d region , in @xcite , authors provide a study on connectivity and coverage issues in a randomly deployed 3d wsn . in this paper",
    ", we compare our proposed sixsoid based @xmath1-coverage model with the existing reuleaux tetrahedron based model @xcite .",
    "comparison has been done in terms of volume of @xmath1-coverage , sensor spatial density in 3d and placement and packing in 3d .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , the authors used a convex body that resembles a super - ellipse for @xmath1-coverage in 2d homogeneous wsn . this model",
    "@xcite showed much better efficiency in terms of area of @xmath1-coverage , energy consumption and requirement of less number of sensors as compared to the @xmath1-coverage model with reuleaux triangle @xcite .",
    "this work done in @xcite is further extended to 3d by taking reuleaux tetrahedron .",
    "motivated by the fact that considering a `` super - elliptical '' tile has proven to be much better than the reuleaux triangle based model @xcite , in this work we extend that idea to 3d .",
    "the main hurdle was to compute the volume of the solid ( sixsoid ) generated out of our construction . unlike the reuleaux tetrahedron its volume was not already known .",
    "another reason for opting our construction is its resemblence to a superellipsoid because of which it fits much better in 3d rather than a reuleaux tetrahedron .",
    "moreover , sixsoid provides a practical and easier packing in 3d . once we fill the foi with cubes of side length @xmath4 , a sixsoid is formed by the overlapping of six sensors lying on the six face centers of a cube .",
    "so , every cube contains a sixsoid inside it .",
    "when we consider packing in 3d , cubes are space filling .",
    "we propose a result in a later section that states that our deployment strategy ensures 4-coverage of the entire foi along with fact that approximately 68% of it is 6-covered .",
    "thus , the sixsoid based model ensures at least 4-coverage of the entire foi .",
    "packing of reuleaux tetrahedron in 3d as proposed in @xcite is harder to achieve and it is not feasible for practical deployment . in the subsequent sections , we calculate the volume of the sixsoid with the supporting theorems and compare our results with the reuleaux tetrahedron based model . in the remaining part of the paper , we discuss the computation of volume of a sixsoid in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the deployment and packing strategy in 3d that exploits the structure of sixsoid .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the comparison of our model with the results proposed in @xcite .",
    "we end the paper with conclusion and potential research directions for future .",
    "the * sixsoid * which we denote by @xmath5 is defined as the 3-d object obtained due to the intersection of six spheres placed on the centers of the faces of a cube of side - length @xmath4 .",
    "the radius of each sphere is @xmath4 . in this section ,",
    "we compute the volume @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "our basic strategy is to take a horizontal cross section ( via a sliding plane ) of the cube at a distance of @xmath7 from the top of the cube and perform the following integration , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the area of the cross section and the last equality follows due to the symmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "henceforth , we will use the following notation regarding the geometry of the objects involved in this section .",
    "let @xmath11(top ) , @xmath12(bottom ) , @xmath13(left ) , @xmath14(right ) , @xmath15(front ) , @xmath16(back ) be the faces of the cube and we denote the respective spheres ( centered at face centers ) by @xmath17 .",
    "we will denote the sliding plane by @xmath18 and let @xmath19 be its radius .",
    "let @xmath20 be the circle which is obtained by the intersection of @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the remainder of this section",
    "we show the behavior of the cross - section as the plane @xmath21 slides from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .    for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "are concentric circles and @xmath30 . also as @xmath7 varies from @xmath31 to @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 monotonically decreases , @xmath34 monotonically increases and @xmath35 at @xmath36 .    for @xmath27 , @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 from @xmath25 to @xmath39 , where @xmath40    we observe that , @xmath9 is exactly @xmath29 as @xmath21 slides below @xmath25 .",
    "so to compute @xmath9 we only need to compute the radius @xmath34 of @xmath29 .",
    "this value can be computed as @xmath41 , which proves the claim regarding @xmath9 .",
    "now inorder to know @xmath42 ( the event when the cross section changes ) , we need to find the value of @xmath7 at which @xmath29 is tangential to @xmath43 , this is also the instance at which @xmath29 is tangential to each @xmath44 and @xmath43 . to find this @xmath7 we need to solve the following equation ,",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 the root of the above quadratic equation which is less than @xmath32 is @xmath47 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",

    "the cross - section is a 8-sided closed region drawn in fig.[z2 ] .",
    "let @xmath57 be the center of the square and @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "our aim is to find out the area of the region @xmath60 . from the notation used in the fig .",
    "[ z2 ] we deduce that @xmath61 .",
    "also it is easy to see that @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the length of the line segment joining @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we first show how to compute @xmath64 in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath7 . + * computing @xmath64 * : notice that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are points of intersection of the circles @xmath67 and @xmath29 .",
    "let us write the equation of these circles assuming @xmath57 to be the origin and lines parallel to @xmath68 and @xmath69 axis passing though it as @xmath70 and @xmath71 axes .",
    "the equations of @xmath67 and @xmath29 in this coordinate system would be @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "subtracting the later from the former gives @xmath74 .",
    "now if we conside the equation of @xmath67 as a quadratic equation in @xmath71 with @xmath74 then the modulus of the difference of the roots of this equation will exactly be the length of @xmath64 .",
    "simple algebraic manipulation shows that @xmath75    the desired area can be decomposed into two parts .",
    "( i ) 4 times the area of sector @xmath76 ( ii ) 4 times the area of region @xmath77 .",
    "we compute each of these as follows :    * area of sector @xmath76 is @xmath78 * area of the region @xmath77 = area of ( @xmath79 ) + area of the cap , which is equal to + @xmath80 + @xmath81    adding the aforementioned two values , multiplying by 4 , and replacing the values of @xmath82 , gives us the expression of @xmath9 in the lemma . + * computing @xmath83 * : to find the value of @xmath7 at which the cross - section changes from the above mentioned 8-sided region , we need to look at the instant when the circle @xmath29 circumscribes the region formed due the intersection of @xmath84 . at this instant",
    "the following equality holds ; @xmath85 which solves to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , since @xmath27 , the only root which is of concern for us is @xmath88 .    @xmath89 +   4\\left[(y - \\frac{r}{2})\\right]^2 $ ] . where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath93 , @xmath9 is the area which is common to @xmath94 .",
    "fig.[z7 ] shows the geometry of @xmath9 . again",
    "let @xmath57 be the center of the square    we divide it into two parts , ( i ) the square @xmath95 ( ii ) four caps surrounding the square each of equal area .",
    "we compute each of these areas as follows :    * the area of the square is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the side length of the square , which according to the figure is @xmath98 .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus area of the square is @xmath101 * the area of a cap ( say the cap @xmath102 ) can be obtained by subtracting the area of @xmath103 from the area of sector @xmath104 which is equal to @xmath105 where @xmath90 and + @xmath91 , @xmath106    putting the values of @xmath69 and @xmath107 and multiplying the area of the cap by @xmath108 gives us the desired result .",
    "we use observation 1 , to conclude that the cross section does nt change for all values of @xmath7 between @xmath109 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath110 .    as a consequence of the previous results",

    "the value of @xmath6 turns out to be approximately @xmath112 .      to compute the volume of the foi we need to compute the volume that is only 3-covered , as the remaining volume is 4-covered .",
    "we notice that as the horizonal plane slides from @xmath113 to @xmath36 , the topology of the cross section that is only 3-covered changes twice , thus to compute the volume inside the cube that is only 3-covered have to perform an integration similar to case of the sixsoid . it can be verified",

    "this comparison is tabulated in table [ t2 ] .",
    "next , we evaluate the sensor spatial density for @xmath1-coverage in the sixsoid model and compare it with the reuleaux tetrahedron model . recall that the minimum sensor spatial density per unit volume needed for full @xmath1-coverage of a 3d field is defined as a function of sensing radius @xmath2 as @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
