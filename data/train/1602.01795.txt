    "<S> the axial anomaly in quasi - two dimensional materials proposed for the nlmr in ptcoo@xmath0 is mostly unlikely to be the origin of nlmr here since our sample is quite isotropic suggested by both sdh and dft data ( table i ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetism can cause nlmr , however , no sign of loss of spin scattering appears in our resistivity data and thus impossible to induce such large nlmr . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , recently it has been proposed that nlmr may occur due to impurity scattering , if the material is in its ultraquantum limit regardless of the band structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the negative response clearly shows even at 2 t ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) ) , which is far from the ultraquantum limit here . </S>",
    "<S> nlmr can also arise from the chiral anomaly if weyl nodes are created under external field , which is a charge pumping effect between different weyl branches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , careful examination of the band structure and symmetry characterization under field are needed to support this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> what s more , although great effort has been made to avoid the artifact effect , a systematic study of lmr on samples with different thickness down to tenths of @xmath91 size is urged to understand the nlmr here @xcite .    in conclusion , nbas@xmath0 is a compensated semimetal with large mobilities , leading to the observed large mr . </S>",
    "<S> three fermi pockets are identified and their fermi topology are mapped out both sdh measurements and dft calculations . although the oscillations associated with the hole @xmath4 pocket are missing , our dft calculations are overall consistent with the sdh experiment . </S>",
    "<S> nlmr exists and further systematic investigation is needed to discern the origin of the observed nlmr .    </S>",
    "<S> note : during the submission of this paper , we noticed serval magneto - transport work on tasb@xmath0 , taas@xmath0 @xcite and tmr data on nbas@xmath0 @xcite . </S>"
