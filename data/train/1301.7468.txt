    "<S> , we deduce that , in this case , the @xmath1-norms of eigenfunctions for the above range of exponents is relatively small . as a result , we can slightly improve the known lower bounds for nodal sets in dimensions @xmath7 of colding and minicozzi  @xcite in the special case of ( variable ) nonpositive curvature .    * in memoriam : _ lars hrmander ( 1931 - 2012 ) _ * </S>"
