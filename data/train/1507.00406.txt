    "inspiralling compact binaries containing spinning neutron stars and ( or ) black holes ( bhs ) are key sources for the network of second generation interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors @xcite .",
    "these instruments include the two advanced ligo ( aligo ) observatories @xcite , the advanced virgo @xcite , the kagra @xcite , the geo - hf @xcite and the planned ligo - india @xcite .",
    "in contrast , massive spinning bh binaries are one of the most exciting sources for the space - based gw observatory like the planned elisa @xcite .",
    "gws from such inspiralling compact binaries , whose components are specified by their masses and spins , can be accurately modeled using perturbative approaches to tackle the underlying einstein field equations @xcite . therefore , the optimal detection technique of _ matched filtering _ can be employed to detect and characterize inspiral gws from such binaries @xcite .",
    "this involves cross correlating the interferometric output data with a bank of templates that theoretically model inspiral gws from spinning compact binaries .",
    "a successful detection demands that at least one template should remain in phase as much as possible with the buried weak gw signals in the frequency windows of various gw observatories @xcite .    during the gw emission induced inspiral",
    ", dynamics and associated gws from compact binaries can be accurately described using the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity @xcite .",
    "the pn description provides interesting quantities , required for various template constructions , as an asymptotic series in terms of certain dimensionless parameter . for binaries in quasi - circular orbits , it is usual to use @xmath3 as the pn expansion parameter while constructing inspiral templates , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the total mass and orbital ( angular ) frequency of the binary @xcite .",
    "currently , gw frequency and associated phase evolution , crucial inputs to construct various inspiral template families , are known to 3.5pn order for non - spinning compact binaries @xcite . in other words , pn corrections to the above two quantities are computed to the @xmath6 order beyond the leading quadrupolar ( newtonian ) order for such binaries . moreover , the amplitudes of the two gw polarization states , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for non - spinning binaries are available to 3pn order @xcite . very recently , detailed computations led to the determination of the dynamics of such binaries to the 4pn order @xcite .",
    "binaries that contain compact objects with intrinsic rotations , the spin effects enter the dynamics and gw emission via spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions @xcite . in binaries containing maximally spinning bhs , the spin - orbit coupling ( linear in the spins ) first appears at the 1.5pn order , while the spin - spin interaction ( which is quadratic in spins ) first occurs at the 2pn order @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath1 , the two spin and orbital angular momenta , for generic spinning compact binaries precess around the total angular momentum @xmath11 due to spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions . this forces substantial modulations of the emitted gws from inspiralling generic spinning compact binaries compared to their non - spinning counterparts @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to incorporate various effects due to the intrinsic rotations of compact objects while constructing inspiral gw templates for spinning compact binaries . at present , gw frequency evolution and amplitudes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for bh binaries having maximally spinning components are fully determined to 2.5pn and 2pn orders , respectively , while incorporating all the relevant spin induced effects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the on - going detailed computations are providing various higher pn order spin - orbit and spin - spin contributions to the dynamics of spinning compact binaries in general orbits and to the orbital frequency evolution for quasi - circular inspiral . at present , the spin - orbit contributions to binary dynamics and gw frequency evolution are available up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( 2pn order ) beyond the leading order @xcite while adapting the mpm ( multipolar post - minkowskian ) approach @xcite . in contrast , the higher order spin - spin contributions to the binary dynamics are usually tackled in the arnowitt - deser - misner canonical formalism @xcite and in the effective field theory formalism @xcite ( note that the spin - orbit effects in the effective field theory formalism are computed , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "these approaches provide various spin(1)-spin(2 ) and spin - squared contributions to the orbital dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , various source multipole moments needed to obtain the spin contributions to gw luminosity at the 3pn order and gw polarization states to the 2.5pn order were computed in @xcite .",
    "the construction of time - domain @xmath7 and @xmath12 associated with inspiralling generic spinning compact binaries requires us to numerically solve a set of pn accurate differential equations for @xmath13 and the orbital phase @xcite , where @xmath0 is the newtonian orbital angular momentum .",
    "the numerical integration provides temporal evolutions for the orbital phase , the associated angular frequency and the two angles that specify the orientation of the orbital plane in an inertial frame associated with the direction of @xmath14 at the initial epoch .",
    "these variations are incorporated into the pn accurate expressions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 to obtain pn accurate time - domain inspiral waveforms from such binaries @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the differential equation for the orbital phase explicitly depends on the precessional motion of the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to express the orbital phase as an integral of the orbital frequency as usually done in the case of non - spinning compact binaries @xcite .",
    "a decade ago , buonanno , chen and vallisneri proposed an approach , referred to as the precessing convention , that factorizes the generic spinning binary waveform into a _ carrier signal _ and a _ modulated amplitude _ term @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the phase of the carrier signal ( @xmath15 ) essentially coincides with the accumulated orbital phase such that @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the precessional dynamics of the orbital plane only influences the modulated amplitude part of inspiral waveform even for generic compact binaries .",
    "therefore , the precessing convention disentangles the precessional effects from its non - precessional counterparts while modeling both the amplitude and the phase evolutions of inspiral gws from such astrophysical systems .",
    "this convention was employed to model inspiral gw signals from compact binaries containing misaligned single - spin and to probe its data analysis benefits @xcite . very recently , inspiral - merger - ringdown waveforms for generic spinning bh binaries , invoking the effective - one - body approach @xcite , also adapted the precessing convention to model gws from the inspiral part @xcite .",
    "we note that this convention requires a _ precessing source frame _ which is usually based on the newtonian orbital angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xcite employed both @xmath17 and @xmath0 to model gws during the late part of the binary inspiral just prior to the plunge .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a prescription to compute pn accurate inspiral waveforms for generic spinning compact binaries while using the pn accurate orbital angular momentum @xmath17 to construct the precessing source frame .",
    "this is influenced by the usual practice of employing precessional equation appropriate for @xmath1 to evolve @xmath0 and the associated precessing source frame while constructing inspiral waveforms via the precessing convention of @xcite .",
    "we show that the use of such an adiabatic approximation , namely employing an orbital averaged differential equation for @xmath0 , can lead to pn corrections to @xmath18 .",
    "these observations motivated us to provide a set of pn accurate equations to obtain temporally evolving quadrupolar order inspiral gw polarization states for generic spinning compact binaries in the @xmath17-based precessing convention . in our approach ,",
    "the spin precession induced modulations enter the differential equation for the orbital phase only at the 3pn order .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17-based convention requires us to include additional 3pn order terms in the differential equation for @xmath19 , compared to the usual @xmath0-based approach .",
    "we explore the practical implications of these additional terms with the help of _ match _ computations , detailed in @xcite .",
    "the match computations involve two inspiral families where one is constructed via our @xmath1-based precessing convention and therefore incorporate the above mentioned 3pn order terms .",
    "the other family is based on the lalsuite spintaylort4 code , developed by the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) @xcite , that implemented the @xmath0-based precessing convention of @xcite . in this code , the precessional dynamics is fully 2pn accurate while the differential equation for @xmath19 incorporates spin - orbit contributions to 3.5pn order . for match computations , we employ pn accurate relation connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 to construct two waveform families with physically identical initial orbital and spin orientations .",
    "we terminate the two inspiral waveform families when their respective @xmath19 parameter reaches @xmath20 which roughly corresponds to orbital separations @xmath21 .",
    "these considerations allow us to attribute the reported match estimates to the above mentioned additional 3pn order terms present in our differential equations for the orbital phase and frequency .",
    "we find that the match estimates are less than the optimal 0.97 value for a non - negligible fraction of unequal mass spinning compact binaries .",
    "it may be recalled that such an optimal match value roughly corresponds to a @xmath22 loss in the ideal event rate . in what follows ,",
    "we briefly summarize the usual implementation of the @xmath0-based precessing convention and explore the consequence of employing an orbital averaged precessional equation for @xmath0 .",
    "in section  [ sec_l ] , we detail the construction of quadrupolar order gw polarization states in our @xmath1-based precessing convention .",
    "the match estimates involving these two inspiral families with physically equivalent initial configurations and associated discussions are listed in section  [ result ] while section  [ sec_dis ] provides a brief summary .",
    "we begin by summarizing the usual implementation of the @xmath0-based precessing convention and explore the consequence of employing an orbital averaged differential equation for @xmath0 .",
    "the precessing convention , introduced in @xcite , aims to remove all the spin precession induced modulations from the orbital phase evolution . in this approach , the orbital phase @xmath23 is written as an integral of the orbital frequency @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 , even for generic spinning compact binaries .",
    "this feature is crucial to ensure that the inspiral waveform for a precessing spinning compact binary can be written as the product of a non - precessing carrier waveform and a modulation term that contains all the precessional effects .",
    "this is how the approach disentangles the precessional effects from their non - precessional counterparts both in the amplitude and phase of inspiral waveforms .",
    "it should be noted that in the absence of precessing convention , the orbital phase of a generic spinning binary is given by @xmath26 \\ ,",

    "the basis vectors of this triad satisfy the evolution equations @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the angular frequency @xmath33 is constructed in such a manner that these three basis vectors always form an orthonormal triad .",
    "this is possible with the following expression for @xmath33 , namely @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the usually employed precessional frequency for @xmath30 .",
    "the expression for @xmath36 that includes the dominant order spin - orbit and spin - spin contributions can be obtained by collecting the terms that multiply @xmath37 @xmath38 in equation ( 9 ) of @xcite . with the help of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , an orbital phase @xmath23",
    "may be defined such that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the unit vector along the binary separation vector @xmath43 .",
    "additionally , one may define a co - moving frame ( @xmath44 ) such that the time derivative of @xmath42 is given by @xmath45 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that @xmath33 should only be proportional to @xmath42 which ensures that @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to the desirable expression for @xmath47 , namely @xmath48 , while employing the adiabatic condition for the sequence of circular orbits : @xmath49 .",
    "this adiabatic condition is equivalent to @xmath50 that provides another version of the pn independent relation connecting the linear and orbital angular velocities , @xmath51 .",
    "a close inspection reveals that this approach usually employs an orbital averaged differential equation for @xmath0 to evolve the precessing source frame while constructing pn accurate inspiral waveforms .",
    "it turns out that the differential equation for @xmath0 in such an adiabatic approximation is identical to the evolution equation for the pn accurate orbital angular momentum @xmath1 @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we explore the effect of such an adiabatic approximation on the equation for @xmath52 in the ( @xmath53 ) co - moving frame and on the derivation of @xmath47 equation . the usually employed expression for @xmath54 while considering only the leading order spin - orbit interactions",

    "it is straightforward to show that the above equation is identical to @xmath67 terms that multiply @xmath68 on the right hand side of equation ( 9 ) in @xcite . to explore the implication of using the above expression for @xmath54 to construct @xmath69",
    ", we revisit the arguments detailed in the appendix  b of @xcite .",
    "these arguments , crucial to obtain @xmath48 , require that @xmath70 , appearing in the equation @xmath45 , should be zero .",
    "a closer look reveals that @xcite did not use the explicit expression for @xmath33 to show that @xmath33 lies along @xmath42 .",
    "instead , the authors arrived at such a conclusion with the help of the following two steps .",
    "first , it was noted that @xmath71 should be @xmath72 ( see lines around equations  ( b3 ) , ( b4 ) and ( b5 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "this was inferred by employing the definition for @xmath30 ( @xmath73 ) , the resulting time derivative for @xmath30 ( @xmath74 ) , the adiabatic condition for circular orbits ( @xmath75 and the time derivative for @xmath76 in the co - moving frame ( @xmath77 ) . in the second step ,",
    "@xcite invoked the requirement that @xmath71 should also be given by @xmath78 in the precessing source frame . with the help of the above two arguments , namely @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xcite concluded that @xmath33 should lie along @xmath42 as @xmath81 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that @xcite never invoked their explicit expression for @xmath33 to show that @xmath33 can have components only along @xmath42 which is essential to obtain the relation @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to show with the help of equation  ( [ eq_l_omega_k ] ) that @xmath33 can have components along @xmath76 since @xmath82 , in general .",
    "this results in the following 1.5pn accurate expression for @xmath83 @xmath84   + \\frac{\\delta_2}{q}\\ , \\chi_2\\ , \\bigl [ { \\boldsymbol{s}}_2 \\times { \\boldsymbol{n } } - ( { \\boldsymbol{s}}_2 \\cdot { \\boldsymbol{l}})\\ , { \\boldsymbol{\\lambda } } \\bigr ]    \\bigg\\ } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , the 1.5pn order terms that arise from @xmath70 in the above equation will not be zero for generic spinning compact binaries .",
    "interestingly , it is still possible to equate @xmath47 to @xmath85 by employing the adiabatic condition @xmath49 as @xmath86 even in the presence of non - vanishing 1.5pn order @xmath70 term .",
    "however , the equivalent version of the adiabatic condition , namely @xmath50 , forces the differential equation for @xmath15 to contain 3pn order corrections in addition to the standard @xmath5 term .",
    "in other words , two equivalent versions of the same adiabatic condition for circular orbits , namely @xmath49 and @xmath50 , provide different evolution equations for @xmath15 .",
    "this is the unexpected consequence of employing precessional equation appropriate for @xmath1 to evolve the @xmath0-based precessing source frame .",
    "it is not difficult to deduce that this essentially arises from the non - vanishing 1.5pn order @xmath70 contributions to @xmath83 listed in the above equation .",
    "the following arguments can also be used to clarify why the above two versions of the same adiabatic condition for the circular orbits result in two different expressions for @xmath87 . in our opinion , this arises by identifying @xmath88 to be @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the unit vector along @xmath1 .",
    "strictly speaking , the precessing source frame of @xcite is based on @xmath1 rather than @xmath0 due to the use of @xmath54 that provides the precessional equation for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this implies that their co - moving triad is rather @xmath1-based and the expression for @xmath91 got components along @xmath88 instead of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 results in pn corrections to @xmath87 as @xmath93 is unity only at the leading order ( this may be deduced from our equation  ( [ eq_l_k ] ) listed below ) .",
    "this leads to a differential equation for @xmath87 that involves pn corrections to @xmath5 .",
    "the use of precessional equation appropriate for @xmath1 while implementing the precessing convention of @xcite motivated us to develop a @xmath90-based precessing convention for constructing inspiral waveforms for spinning compact binaries .",
    "this should also allow to explore the practical implications of using the adiabatic approximation to evolve @xmath0 in the usual implementation of the precessing convention .",

    "these additional terms appear at the 3pn order as we employ equation  ( [ eq_l_omega_k ] ) for @xmath54 that only incorporates the leading order spin - orbit interactions appearing at 1.5pn order .",
    "it is not difficult to deduce that the inclusion of 2pn order spin - spin interaction terms in @xmath54 can lead to certain 4pn order contributions to the @xmath116 equation .",
    "additionally , the presence of the above 3pn contributions to @xmath116 equation may be attributed to the fact that the orbital velocity @xmath117 can have non - vanishing pn order components along @xmath1 while considering generic spinning compact binaries @xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath1 to describe binary orbits also modifies the evolution equation for @xmath5 ( or @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is because the spin - orbit interactions are usually incorporated in terms of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , in the literature @xcite .",

    "<S> a precessing source frame , constructed using the newtonian orbital angular momentum @xmath0 , can be invoked to model inspiral gravitational waves from generic spinning compact binaries . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive feature of such a precessing convention is its ability to remove all spin precession induced modulations from the orbital phase evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , this convention usually employs a post - newtonian ( pn ) accurate precessional equation , appropriate for the pn accurate orbital angular momentum @xmath1 , to evolve the @xmath0-based precessing source frame . </S>",
    "<S> this influenced us to develop inspiral waveforms for spinning compact binaries in a precessing convention that explicitly employ @xmath1 to describe the binary orbits . </S>",
    "<S> our approach introduces certain additional 3pn order terms in the evolution equations for the orbital phase and frequency with respect to the usual @xmath0-based implementation of the precessing convention . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the practical implications of these additional terms by computing the match between inspiral waveforms that employ @xmath1 and @xmath0-based precessing conventions . </S>",
    "<S> the match estimates are found to be smaller than the optimal value , namely @xmath2 , for a non - negligible fraction of unequal mass spinning compact binaries . </S>"
