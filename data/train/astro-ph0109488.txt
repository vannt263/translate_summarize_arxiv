    "cygnus  a is the best known and nearest example ( @xmath26 ) of a powerful fr  ii radio galaxy in a cluster of galaxies ( e.g. , barthel & arnaud 1996 ) . at x - ray wavelengths , cygnus",
    "a was first detected by @xcite using the _ uhuru _ satellite .",
    "_ einstein _ imaging data subsequently showed the radio source to reside in @xmath27 of hot gas , extending some 1  mpc ( assuming @xmath28  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 ) to the nw of cygnus  a @xcite .",
    "a dense core of hot gas , centered on the radio galaxy , was found to have an apparent cooling flow rate of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "_ exosat _ and _ heao-1 _ observations yielded a temperature of @xmath30@xmath31  kev for the intracluster gas , with the radio galaxy modeled as an absorbed power - law @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations with _ ginga _ @xcite and _ asca _ ( sambruna , eracleous , & mushotzky 1999 ) gave a higher temperature of @xmath32@xmath33  kev and an iron abundance of @xmath19 times solar . from _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) observations , @xcite suggest that the gas temperature within the inner 50  kpc is significantly cooler ( @xmath34  kev ) than the ambient cluster temperature at radii @xmath35  kpc , and that the cooling flow rate is @xmath36 . in a recent analysis of the _ asca _ data , @xcite and markevitch , sarazin , & vikhlinin ( 1999 )",
    "have found evidence for a merger between the two sub - clusters whose gas temperatures are @xmath37@xmath31  kev .",
    "the bi - modal redshift distribution of the galaxies in cygnus  a is also suggestive of a merger , although the density of galaxies does not correspond well to the distribution of x - ray emitting gas @xcite . from an analysis of the undeconvolved _ asca _ gas imaging spectrometer data , @xcite derived the overall cluster temperature and iron abundance to be @xmath38  kev and @xmath39 solar , respectively .",
    "the data were also modeled with a strong cooling flow of @xmath40 , a high ambient cluster temperature of @xmath41  kev , and a metallicity close to solar values .",
    "this paper is devoted to a _",
    "study of the intracluster gas in the cygnus  a cluster of galaxies .",
    "the morphology and radial profile of the x - ray emitting gas are discussed in sections  [ sec - morphology ] and  [ sec - radial ] . in sections  [ sec - spectrum ] and",
    "[ sec - observed ] , we derive the spectra of the gas and the observed radial dependences of the temperature and abundance .",
    "section  [ sec - deprojected ] is devoted to a deprojection of the observed spectral brightness distribution , providing the radial dependences of the temperature , abundance , emissivity , density , and pressure of the intracluster gas .",
    "these parameters are then used ( section  [ sec - mass ] ) to obtain the distributions of the gas mass and total mass of the cluster . in section",
    "[ sec - filaments ] , we discuss the extended filaments and belts of x - ray emission around the cavity in the intracluster gas which has been created by the radio source .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath28  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and @xmath42 in this paper , which gives @xmath43  kpc , an angular size distance of @xmath44  mpc , and a luminosity distance to cygnus  a of @xmath45  mpc .",
    "cygnus  a has been observed on three occasions with the _ chandra _ acis ( acis is described by g. garmire et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the results from an analysis of the radio hot spots ( wilson , young , & shopbell 2000 , hereafter paper i ) and the central nucleus ( young et al . 2001 , hereafter paper ii ) are presented elsewhere .",
    "the rationale for the three observations is described in paper  ii .",
    "we concern ourselves here with a study of the surrounding intracluster gas , and analyze only data acquired during the @xmath46  ks exposure on may 21 , 2000 ( obsid 360 ) , which provided an observation of cygnus  a over a wide field . the data reduction and analysis were done using _",
    "chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) _ software version 2.1 , and the reprocessed ( on january 25 , 2001 ) event files .",
    "we created a new level 2 events file , applying the latest gain corrections ( of january 25 , 2001 ) , the same good time intervals as in the existing level 2 events file , and _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "periods of non - quiescent background ( i.e. , flares or data dropouts due to telemetry saturation ) were removed from the data .",
    "this was achieved by creating a light curve of the whole s3 chip , excluding the brightest sources of x - ray emission , and removing events @xmath47 from the mean count rate .",
    "this gives an effective exposure time of @xmath48  ks ( corrected for dead - time in the detector ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from the cluster extends over the whole s3 chip , so our analysis procedure followed that described in @xcite .",
    "spatial variations in the detector background were estimated from several acis blank - field observations@xmath49maxim / axaf / acisbg/ for further details regarding the acis background fields . ] with a total exposure of @xmath50  ks on the s3 chip .",
    "these data were taken at the same focal plane temperature as our _ chandra _ observation ( i.e. , @xmath51c ) . in the 1011  kev band , where few or no cosmic x - rays are expected , the observed count rate is @xmath52% higher in our observation than in the blank field observations ( where the quoted error is only the random component ) .",
    "this excess count rate is comparable with the systematic error in the background rate from field to field @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following sections , we have used a background rate that is 5% higher than the value obtained from the blank field observations .",
    "finally , an exposure map for the s3 chip was created from knowledge of the satellite pointing direction and the effective area across the detector .    in section",
    "[ sec - deprojected ] , we present a deprojection of the x - ray emission of the cluster gas associated with cygnus  a. in brief , we derive the radial temperature , abundance , and emissivity using the xspec mixing model `` projct '' written by one of us ( kaa ) .",
    "this mixing model sums model spectra from ellipsoidal shells to give the observed , projected spectral emission of each elliptical annulus .",
    "the number of ellipsoidal shells is taken to be the same as the number of annuli , with each shell projecting onto one annulus . in the inner regions of the cluster ,",
    "the shells are assumed to be prolate , with the major axis in the plane of the sky . in the outer regions , the shells are spherical .",
    "thus , there are no free parameters associated with the geometry .",
    "the `` projct '' model allows the annuli to have different semi - major axes , semi - minor axes , and orientations but they are required to have the same centroid .",
    "an unsmoothed _ chandra _ x - ray image of the region of the radio source cygnus  a was shown in figure  1 of paper i ( see also figure  [ fig11 ] of present paper ) . an alternative representation can be obtained by adaptively smoothing the image ( the _ ciao _ program csmooth ) . in this process , the width of the two - dimensional gaussian smoothing profile is a function of the signal to noise ratio of the data .",
    "pixels with signal @xmath53 above the local background were left unsmoothed while for the remaining pixels , the width of the gaussian was increased until the convolved signal at that location exceeded the local background by @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting image is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "inspection of the unsmoothed ( figure  1 of paper i ; figure  [ fig11 ] of present paper ) and smoothed ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) images reveals the following features ( see wilson , young , & shopbell 2001 for an earlier summary ) .",
    "the dominant structure is a roughly elliptical ( presumably prolate spheroidal in 3-d ) feature with semi - major axis @xmath0 .",
    "the major axis coincides well with that of the radio source , and the radio hot spots are seen as compact x - ray sources at the ends of the major axis ( paper i ) .",
    "this structure appears to be the observational manifestation of the intracluster gas which has been swept up and compressed by a cavity which is expected to be inflated in the intracluster gas by relativistic material which has passed through the hot spots at the ends of the jets @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission around the cavity seems to be edge - brightened .",
    "curved linear structures run along the major axis from the nucleus to each pair of hot spots and may be the x - ray manifestations of the jets ; they will not be discussed further in this paper .",
    "there is extended x - ray emission associated with the nucleus ( paper ii ) .",
    "bright curved bands of x - ray emission extend along the minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "their morphology , particularly in the unsmoothed image , is suggestive of `` belts '' of gas extending around the equator of the prolate spheroidal structure .",
    "since the dominant radio jet is on the nw side of the nucleus , it is usually supposed that this is the near side of the radio source .",
    "if the `` belts '' are circular and in the equatorial plane of the cavity , their sense of curvature indicates that they are predominantly on the far side .",
    "the reason for the absence of belts curved concave to the nw ( as would be expected for the near side gas ) is unclear .",
    "as we shall see ( section  [ sec - filaments ] ) , the belts are gas with a temperature of @xmath16  kev and could represent a large - scale accretion disk , with gas flowing in to cygnus  a. the existence of the cavity and evidence for its edge - brightening was inferred from lower resolution _ rosat _ hri observations by @xcite and a numerical simulation of its dynamics was presented by @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the cavity will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "an image of the x - ray emission on chip s3 ( size @xmath55 ) is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the background has been subtracted from the raw image and the result has been corrected for variations in vignetting and relative exposure .",
    "the final image has been convolved with a two - dimensional gaussian profile of width @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the radio galaxy is located towards the upper right , at the aimpoint of the s3 chip .",
    "it is clear from this image that the spatial extent of the x - ray emitting gas is larger than the field of view of the s3 chip , as already known from earlier observations ( e.g. , reynolds & fabian 1996 ) .",
    "in addition to the galaxy nucleus and radio hot spots , a total of 19 compact sources were detected on the s3 chip with a significance threshold of @xmath58 using the _ ciao _ program wavdetect will give approximately one false source for the whole s3 chip ( see section 9.2.3.4 of the detect user s guide version 1.0 which is available at http://cxc.harvard.edu/udocs/docs/swdocs/detect/html/mdetect.html ) ] .",
    "however , none of the galaxies listed in table  1 of @xcite , and visible within the field of view of the s3 chip , was detected .",
    "we conclude that these compact x - ray sources are most likely foreground ( e.g. , stars ) or background ( e.g. , agn ) objects .",
    "an image of the whole _",
    "field is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this image has been binned to a pixel size of @xmath59 .",
    "the bright source near the center of the image is cygnus  a. the x - ray emission from the intracluster gas extends at least @xmath3 from the radio galaxy .",
    "a second , fainter source of extended x - ray emission is seen some @xmath5 to the nw of cygnus  a , and is partially obscured by the boundary dividing the s1 and s2 chips .",
    "this second source was detected by _",
    "@xcite and by _ asca _ @xcite .",
    "it is natural to presume that this second extended source represents another cluster of galaxies ( see markevitch et al .",
    "there is also evidence for extended x - ray emission between the two clusters .",
    "a radial profile of the x - ray surface brightness was determined by extracting , from the s3 chip , counts in the 0.758  kev band in circular annuli of width 5  pixels ( @xmath57 ) and centered on the radio galaxy .",
    "we have ignored deviations in the symmetry due to the prolate morphology of the intracluster gas in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "a similar approach to that used in making figure  [ fig2 ] was adopted for removal of background and correction for telescope vignetting . for regions of the chip within @xmath60 of the radio galaxy ,",
    "the annuli were restricted to two pie - shaped regions some @xmath61 and @xmath62 in angular extent , chosen to avoid emission near the radio lobes and hot spots . in the outer regions of the chip , compact sources of x - ray emission",
    "were excluded from the radial profile .",
    "the final profile has been binned so that the signal to noise ratio in each bin exceeds @xmath63 ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile , @xmath64 , has been modeled by an isothermal @xmath65 profile @xcite : @xmath66^{-3\\beta + 0.5 } , \\label{eqn - king}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath65 are the central surface brightness , angular distance from the center , the angular core radius , and the slope parameter , respectively . in fitting the model ,",
    "we have used only data at radii @xmath70@xmath71 and @xmath72 , chosen to avoid , as much as possible , the increase in surface brightness around the edge of the cavity and at the nucleus of the radio galaxy .",
    "the model provides a poor description of the profile even when these anomalous regions are excluded , with @xmath73 for 51 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) ; the best - fit parameters are @xmath74  arcsec and @xmath75 .",
    "we note that the isothermal @xmath65 profile is flat inside @xmath69 , and thus small values of @xmath69 may indicate that there is emission in excess of that expected from the ambient intracluster gas .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath76  arcsec and @xmath77 , using the _ rosat _ hri data at radii @xmath78 .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the data within radii @xmath70@xmath79 , the same radial extent as that used in @xcite , then we find @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "an isothermal @xmath65 profile with these parameters , when extrapolated to larger radii , underestimates the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the data have also been modeled with the analytic expression of suto , sasaki , & makino ( 1998 ) for the navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) profile : @xmath82^{-\\eta } , \\label{eqn - nfw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the characteristic density of the cluster , @xmath88 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the characteristic scale radius of the cluster , @xmath91 is the mean molecular weight ( @xmath92 if no metals present ) , @xmath93 is the mass of the proton , @xmath94 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath95 is the temperature of the gas , and @xmath96 is the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "this model also provides a poor description of the profile ( again , the anomalous regions were omitted ) with @xmath97 for 51 d.o.f . ; the best - fit parameters are @xmath98  arcsec and @xmath99 .",
    "the nfw profile may not be an accurate description of the density of the dark matter halo within the inner regions of the cluster , due to the poor spatial resolution of the @xmath100-body simulations @xcite .",
    "however , we have also tried to model the data with a generalized form of the profile , in which @xmath101 and @xmath102 are free parameters , without success .",
    "it is possible that the central @xmath103 region of the cluster are not in hydrostatic equilibrium ( there a powerful radio source located at the center of the cluster ) or that the x - ray surface brightness increases towards the center of the cluster as a result of a cooling flow , which would explain why the data are not described by either the isothermal @xmath65 or nfw profiles .",
    "unfortunately , modeling the data at radii @xmath72 does not allow a determination of the core radius for either description of the profile .",
    "instead , a power - law of @xmath104 ( errors here and elsewhere in this paper are @xmath105% confidence for one interesting parameter , @xmath106 ) provides a reasonable description of the profile with @xmath107 for 48 d.o.f .",
    "the spectral variations in the intracluster gas are illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] , which is a color map of the softness ratio ( 12  kev/28  kev ) for the same region as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we have extracted images in the 12  kev and 28  kev bands , as input to the program adaptivebin version 0.1.2 @xcite .",
    "the resulting color image was adaptively binned so that the maximum fractional error in the color was 0.1 at each location ( see color bar on right of figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "background was subtracted from the images , so that the colors represent the softness ratios of the celestial x - ray emission .",
    "the color image shows that emission inside the central @xmath108 is softer than that further out .",
    "the hardest emission is located at the position of the nucleus , which is heavily absorbed ( arnaud et al .",
    "1987 ; ueno et al . 1994 ; sambruna et al . 1999",
    "; paper ii ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the spatial variations of the properties ( e.g. , density , temperature , and abundances ) of the intracluster gas in the inner region of the cygnus  a cluster ( i.e. , that which falls on chip s3 in our observation ) .",
    "we began by extracting spectra from several annuli centered on the radio galaxy ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) using pi channels , which account for variations in the gain across each of the extraction regions .",
    "we created response matrices appropriate for our spectra by weighting the position dependent response and effective area by the number of counts in the corresponding region .",
    "care was taken to avoid emission powered by the radio galaxy itself ; this is the reason only sectors of elliptical annuli ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) were used in the inner regions ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] for the parameters of the ellipses used for each annulus ) .",
    "the angular extents of the sectors used for the outer annuli were limited by the size of the ccd chip ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "initially , the spectrum of _ all _ the intracluster gas within the s3 chip , excluding the contribution from the radio galaxy and other compact sources of x - ray emission , was modeled by an absorbed , single temperature mekal @xcite , using xspec version 11.0.1 @xcite .",
    "the absorption cross - sections of @xcite and abundances of @xcite were used throughout . this model ( model 1 ) gives a poor fit to the data with @xmath109 for 489 d.o.f .",
    "( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit temperature , metallicity , and equivalent hydrogen absorbing column density are @xmath110  kev , @xmath111 , and @xmath112  @xmath113 , respectively . the combined spectrum , together with the residuals to this model fit ,",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "there are large residuals near the m - edge of iridium , which arises from x - ray absorption in the telescope mirror surface .",
    "large residuals near the iridium m - edge were also found in the spectra of two high temperature clusters , a665 and a2163 , observed with the front - illuminated ccds on _ chandra _ @xcite .",
    "ignoring the data between 1.8 and 2.2  kev ( as markevitch & vikhlinin have done ) gives a better , although still unacceptable , fit of @xmath114 for 461 d.o.f .",
    ", with the observed temperature , metallicity , and absorbing column density essentially unchanged from their former values .",
    "for comparison , the medium energy experiment on _ exosat _ measured a temperature of @xmath115  kev and an iron abundance of @xmath116 times solar for the intracluster gas @xcite .",
    "similarly , a temperature of @xmath117  kev and an iron abundance of @xmath118 times solar were found from spectral fits to the _ ginga _ large area counter data @xcite . both of these experiments used non - imaging proportional counters , which included in their field of view emission from both the radio galaxy and the intracluster gas outside chip s3 .",
    "more recent observations with _ asca _ , which also refer to a larger region than ours , measured the overall cluster temperature and abundance to be @xmath119  kev and @xmath120 times solar , respectively @xcite .",
    "there is evidence from _ asca _ observations of clusters for an si / fe abundance ratio which increases with increasing gas temperature @xcite .",
    "an increase in the si / fe abundance would produce more line emission at @xmath121@xmath122 ( si  xiii ) , @xmath123 ( si  ly@xmath124 ) , and @xmath125 ( si  ly@xmath65 )  kev , which may contribute to the positive residuals near the iridium m - edge .",
    "thus , we have replaced the mekal model with a vmekal model , in which h and he have solar abundances , c and n have @xmath126 solar abundances , and the remaining metals are permitted to have variable abundances .",
    "this model provides a slightly better description of the data than model  1 with @xmath127 for 479 d.o.f . the best - fit temperature , si abundance , fe abundance , and equivalent hydrogen absorbing column density are @xmath128  kev , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131  @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "the si / fe abundance ratio is @xmath132 , which is smaller than that observed in other clusters with a similar gas temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , an increased si / fe abundance ratio is not required by the data , but the inaccuracies in the response matrix at the energy of the si line emission makes an accurate determination of the si / fe abundance ratio difficult . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall assume a si / fe abundance ratio of unity .    the galactic column density towards cygnus  a is @xmath133 @xmath113 @xcite , which is higher than that inferred from model  1 .",
    "one possibility is that the galactic column density is lower than that estimated from dickey & lockman s observations .",
    "another explanation for this discrepancy is that the soft x - ray response of the detector is lower than assumed .",
    "however , we have used only data above 0.75  kev , where the acis s3 chip is well calibrated .",
    "additionally , when the radial dependence of the column density was first derived ( see section  [ sec - observed ] ) , we found that the best - fit column density decreased with increasing distance from the radio galaxy , reaching @xmath134  @xmath113 at the outer annulus .",
    "this effect could represent a real variation in the column density .",
    "alternatively , given the low galactic latitude of cygnus  a ( @xmath135 ) , this apparent spatial dependence of @xmath136 could result from the presence of diffuse , soft x - ray emission from our galaxy .",
    "to test this idea , we have added to model  1 a second mekal component , with solar abundances , to represent this possible galactic emission , with both mekals constrained to be absorbed by the same column density ( model  2 ) .",
    "the improvement in the fit compared with that for model  1 is significant at @xmath137% confidence ( on the basis of an _ f _ test for two additional free parameters ) , with @xmath138 for 487 d.o.f . ; the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the observed 0.758  kev flux of the high temperature , cluster component is @xmath139 erg @xmath113 s@xmath11 .",
    "there is no improvement ( at @xmath140% confidence ) in the fit when we allow the abundance of the low temperature , galactic thermal component to vary .",
    "the observed surface brightness of this possible galactic thermal component is @xmath141 erg s@xmath11 @xmath113 arcmin@xmath142 in the 0.758  kev band .",
    "the next step was to model the individual annuli with an absorbed mekal .",
    "we assumed there is little variation in the galactic column over the cluster , and so assumed the same column for all annuli .",
    "two mekal components were used for each annulus .",
    "the first was assumed to have uniform temperature , surface brightness , and abundance ( fixed at solar ) , and was taken to represent the possible foreground galactic emission ( see section  [ sec - spectrum ] ) .",
    "the second , intended to represent the cluster , permitted variable temperature , abundance , and brightness , to derive the radial variations of these properties in the cluster .",
    "the results from this model , in which all annuli were fitted simultaneously , are given in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we note that variations in the absorption column density are not required by the data for this model .",
    "the inferred intracluster gas temperature varies from @xmath143  kev more than @xmath144 from the center to @xmath14  kev some @xmath103 from the center , with the coolest gas immediately adjacent to the cavity created by the radio galaxy ( figure  8a ) .",
    "this temperature variation is compatible with the softness ratio map in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "there is also clear evidence for a metallicity gradient in the x - ray emitting gas , with the highest metallicities ( @xmath120@xmath145 solar ) found in the inner annuli , decreasing to @xmath19 solar in the outer parts ( figure  8b ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with those obtained previously . from the _ rosat _ pspc data",
    ", @xcite find evidence for @xmath146  kev gas within @xmath147 of the radio nucleus . their temperature is lower than that determined from our modeling of the individual annuli .",
    "however , we note that there is evidence for gas at a temperature of @xmath16  kev in the `` belts '' around the cavity ( see section  [ sec - filaments ] below ) , which is marginally consistent with their upper limit ; in fact , the pspc spectrum within @xmath147 of the nucleus may be dominated by the emission from this 4  kev gas . the temperature derived from the pspc data at radii @xmath148",
    "kpc is consistent with the values determined from the _ chandra _ data . using _ asca _",
    "data , @xcite have constructed a map of the projected gas temperature within the cygnus  a cluster . however , their map has poor spatial resolution , with most of the intracluster gas within the s3 chip residing in region  1 .",
    "@xcite measured a gas temperature in the range @xmath14 to @xmath149  kev for x - ray emission within this region , which is consistent with the temperature of the integrated intracluster gas on s3 ( section  [ sec - spectrum ] ) . @xcite identified regions of potentially higher and lower gas temperatures , but most of this emission resides on the other _ chandra _ ccds .",
    "@xcite has performed a re - analysis of the _ asca _ data , and finds that the gas has a temperature in the range @xmath150 to @xmath12  kev in the region covered by the s3 chip , and a metallicity of @xmath151@xmath126 solar .",
    "the x - rays observed from each annulus contain emission from all gas along our line of sight in that direction .",
    "thus , to obtain the physical parameters of the thermal gas as a function of distance from the center , it is necessary to deproject the observed spectral brightness distribution . in performing this deprojection ,",
    "we have assumed that the x - ray emission from the cluster around the radio galaxy is distributed in a series of prolate ellipsoidal shells , whose major axis is along the projected radio jet axis at a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath152 and is in the plane of the sky .",
    "guided by the x - ray isophotes ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , we assumed that the ellipticity of these shells steadily decreases until the shells become spherical some @xmath153 from the center .",
    "we feel this geometry is likely to be a good approximation to that of the intracluster gas in this inner part of the cluster ( there is an extension @xmath154 to the nw , but this region is not on chip s3 ) . as a narrow line radio galaxy , the radio jet and lobes of cygnus  a",
    "are expected to be close to the plane of the sky , a geometry favored by @xcite on independent grounds .",
    "@xcite state that the average ejection angle could be @xmath155 from our line of sight , while @xcite favor @xmath156 based on vlbi observations .",
    "thus our assumption that the major axis of the the prolate spheroid lies in the plane of the sky may not be too far wrong .",
    "one limitation of our analysis is that our outer annulus ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) does not represent the true edge of the intracluster emission ( cf . reynolds & fabian 1996 ) , so there will be faint , more extended intracluster emission projected onto it .    as described in section  [ sec - observations ] , we deprojected the observed emission using the xspec model `` projct '' .",
    "each shell was modeled as a mekal ( thermal ) plasma .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed in the following way .",
    "first , a uniform brightness mekal model ( representing the galactic emission ) was added to a mekal model for the outer shell and the projected result was compared with the observed spectrum of the outer annulus ( annulus 12 ) .",
    "both emission components were assumed to be absorbed by the same column and the model parameters for absorption and galactic emission were subsequently fixed at their respective best - fit values given in table  [ tbl-3 ] . in this way , we derived the temperature , abundance , and emissivity for the outer shell of intracluster gas .",
    "second , the spectra from shells 11 and 12 were modeled as above .",
    "the temperature , abundance , and emissivity for shell 12 were fixed at the values already obtained , allowing us to derive the deprojected temperature , abundance , and emissivity for shell 11 .",
    "this procedure was repeated for the remaining shells , and the results for all shells are given in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "an alternative approach would be to sequentially model the various annuli , but to allow their parameters to be free in the final fitting in which all the projected mekal models are compared with the data .",
    "this approach has the disadvantage that the final modeling is insensitive to the fainter outer regions , for which the derived parameters are thus unreliable .",
    "for this reason , we consider our approach , in which one annulus is added at each modeling and then `` frozen '' in subsequent iterations , to be superior .",
    "the properties of the intracluster gas for each of the spheroidal or spherical shells are given in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "the properties of the gas in the outer shell ( shell 12 ) are not listed since the volume of this shell is smaller than the volume of the intracluster gas projected onto it , rendering the calculated properties unreliable . the pressure and cooling time of the gas are @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "we have used the usual notation here , in which @xmath159 is the electron density , @xmath160 is the volume of the shell , and @xmath161 is the 210  kev rest - frame luminosity after correcting for absorption . in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show the radial dependence of deprojected temperature , electron density , abundance , and gas pressure .",
    "the peak in gas pressure between @xmath105 and @xmath13  kpc is not significant given the errors on the temperature at this location .",
    "the deprojected and observed temperatures and abundances are consistent with each other , which suggests that the emission observed in the inner regions of the cluster dominates the fainter outer emission projected onto it .",
    "it is noteable that the cooling time is less than the hubble time for radii @xmath162  kpc .      under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry of the inter - cluster gas",
    ", the mass of the cluster , @xmath163 , within a radius , @xmath164 , is @xmath165 ( e.g. , fabricant , lecar , & gorenstein 1980 ) , where @xmath166 is the temperature at radius @xmath164 .",
    "we have considered two alternative descriptions of the temperature : ( i ) a constant temperature of 5.73  kev ; ( ii ) a centrally decreasing profile of the form @xmath167 where @xmath168  kev , @xmath169  kev , and @xmath170  kpc are constants determined from modeling the deprojected temperatures .",
    "hence , for the centrally decreasing temperature profile , the second term in parentheses in equation  [ eqn - mass ] may be written @xmath171 the radial dependence of the electron density has been modeled as a broken power - law of the form @xmath172 where @xmath173  @xmath174 , @xmath175  kpc , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 are the best - fit values .",
    "the slope of the density profile at large radii is consistent with an isothermal @xmath65 profile of @xmath178 ( the electron density is @xmath179 for @xmath180 ) .",
    "a similar value for @xmath65 was derived directly from the x - ray surface brightness profile in section  [ sec - radial ] . the first term in parentheses in equation  [ eqn - mass ]",
    "may be written @xmath181    substituting equations  [ eqn - deriv_temp ] and [ eqn - deriv_density ] into equation  [ eqn - mass ] gives the integrated mass of the cluster , including the contributions from dark matter , intracluster gas , and individual galaxies .",
    "the radial dependence of enclosed mass @xmath182 is shown in figure  [ fig10 ] for radii 80500  kpc .",
    "we have also calculated the integrated mass of the intracluster gas , @xmath183 , ( also shown in figure  [ fig10 ] ) for the same range of radii , from @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the volume of the shell containing gas at density @xmath186 ( which is given by equation  [ eqn - density ] ) .",
    "the integrated mass of gas within the inner 80  kpc of the cluster was determined by assuming a constant density of @xmath187  @xmath174 . from the above analysis",
    ", we find the total mass of the cluster , within 500  kpc , is @xmath188 and @xmath189 for the constant and centrally decreasing temperature profiles , respectively .",
    "this compares favorably with the cluster mass of @xmath27 , derived from the _ einstein _ hri data @xcite . within 500  kpc ,",
    "the total mass of the intracluster gas is @xmath190 .",
    "spectra were extracted from several regions of bright , extended x - ray emission near the nucleus ( see figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the regions were chosen so that they included the curved belts of x - ray emission which appear to encircle the radio source cavity , as well as the bright bands of emission around the edge of the cavity .",
    "care was taken to avoid the curved linear structures which extend from the nucleus to radio hot spots as these regions are apparently related to the radio activity which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "prior to modeling , the spectra were re - binned so that there were at least 20  cts bin@xmath11 and the analysis was conducted over the full 0.510 kev band , as the diffuse , x - ray emission from our galaxy is insignificant compared to this emission from these bright inner regions of the intracluster medium .",
    "we have modeled each spectrum with a single temperature mekal , absorbed by a column of cold gas , which provides an acceptable fit to all 10 spectra ( see table  [ tbl-6 ] for details ) .",
    "the gas associated with the regions of the curved belts ( c , d , e , f , g , and i ) has a temperature of @xmath16  kev , which is cooler than that observed some @xmath103 from the center of the cluster ( see section  [ sec - observed ] and table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "gas located in the bands of x - ray emission around the edge of the cavity ( regions a , b , h , and j ) has a higher temperature of @xmath150  kev , which is slightly higher than that inferred ( @xmath14  kev ) in the adjacent , inner regions of the intracluster gas ( section  [ sec - deprojected ] and tables  [ tbl-3 ] and [ tbl-4 ] ) .",
    "this slightly higher temperature might result through heating of the gas by the probably expanding cavity , by means of the bow shock driven into the intracluster gas .",
    "the metallicities ( @xmath191@xmath192 solar ) are consistent with , if somewhat higher than , those observed some @xmath103 from the center .",
    "there appears to be a slight gradient in the absorption column density , with the higher columns observed north of the nucleus .",
    "we note that there is no obvious relationship between measured column density and size of the corresponding extraction region , which would result if diffuse , x - ray emission from our galaxy was significant .",
    "however , the uncertainties on the absorption column densities are comparable to the range of columns , so it is unclear whether this gradient is real .",
    "we have analyzed the properties of the intracluster gas around cygnus  a using an observation with the acis - s aboard _",
    "chandra_. the prolate morphology of the x - ray emission from the intracluster gas within @xmath193 of the radio galaxy appears to be the result of gas being swept up by a cavity created in the intracluster gas by the radio source . at larger radii",
    ", the x - ray emission from the intracluster gas appears to be roughly spherical , and extends at least @xmath3 from the radio galaxy .",
    "a second , fainter source of extended x - ray emission is seen some @xmath5 to the nw of cygnus  a. the radial x - ray surface brightness profile , @xmath64 , can not be modeled by either an isothermal @xmath65 model @xcite or the analytic expression of @xcite for the nfw @xcite profile . however , we find that the surface brightness at radii @xmath72 is adequately described by a power - law @xmath194 .",
    "the spectrum of the intracluster gas imaged on the s3 chip has been modeled by a mekal absorbed by a single column of cold gas .",
    "the temperature and unabsorbed 210  kev rest - frame luminosity of the intracluster gas imaged on s3 are @xmath8  kev and @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the equivalent hydrogen column density is @xmath195 @xmath113 , close to the galactic value , and the metallicity is @xmath9 times solar .",
    "although the data do not require an enhanced si / fe abundance ratio relative to solar , as detected in other clusters with similar gas temperatures @xcite , the actual si abundance is uncertain as a result of the inaccuracies in the response matrix at energies close to the iridium m - edge . we also suspect a galactic thermal component with temperature @xmath196  kev and observed surface brightness @xmath197 erg s@xmath11 @xmath113 arcmin@xmath142 in the 0.758  kev band .",
    "we have deprojected the x - ray spectra taken from several elliptical and circular annuli centered on cygnus  a. the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas drops from @xmath12  kev more than @xmath13  kpc from the center to @xmath14  kev some @xmath15  kpc from the center , with the coolest gas immediately adjacent to the cavity .",
    "the bright `` belts '' of x - ray emission that appear to encircle the radio source cavity are somewhat cooler ( @xmath16  kev ) , while the `` filaments '' responsible for the limb - brightening of the cavity are slightly hotter ( @xmath198  kev ) , perhaps as a result of heating by a bow shock driven by the probably expanding cavity into the intracluster gas .",
    "a metallicity gradient is detected in the x - ray emitting gas , with the highest metallicities ( @xmath18  solar ) found close to the center decreasing to @xmath19  solar in the outer parts .",
    "we have used the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to derive the total gravitational mass of the cluster as a function of radius .",
    "the total mass of the cluster within 500  kpc is @xmath20 and @xmath199 for a constant and centrally decreasing temperature profile , respectively .",
    "the total mass of x - ray emitting gas within the same radius is @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the gas fraction of the cluster within 500  kpc is @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the constant and centrally decreasing temperature profile , respectively .",

    "<S> this structure apparently represents intracluster gas which has been swept up and compressed by a cavity inflated in this gas by relativistic material which has passed through the ends of the radio jets . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emitting gas shows this prolate spheroidal morphology to @xmath2 ( 110  kpc ) from the radio galaxy , but is spherical on larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission from the intracluster gas extends to at least @xmath3 ( @xmath4  kpc ) from the radio galaxy , and a second , extended source of x - ray emission ( probably associated with a second cluster of galaxies ) is seen some @xmath5 ( @xmath6  mpc ) to the nw of cygnus  a. the x - ray spectrum of the integrated intracluster gas imaged on the s3 chip ( dimensions @xmath7  kpc ) , excluding the contribution from the radio galaxy and other compact sources of x - ray emission , has a gas temperature , metallicity , and unabsorbed 210  kev rest - frame luminosity of @xmath8  kev , @xmath9 times solar , and @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we have deprojected the x - ray spectra taken from 12 elliptical and circular annuli in order to derive a run of temperature , metallicity , density , and pressure as a function of radius . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas drops from @xmath12  kev more than @xmath13  kpc from the center to @xmath14  kev some @xmath15  kpc from the center , with the coolest gas immediately adjacent to the radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> `` belts '' of slightly cooler ( @xmath16  kev ) x - ray emitting gas run around the minor dimension of the cavity created by the radio source , while the limb - brightened edges of the cavity are slightly hotter ( @xmath17  kev ) , perhaps as a result of heating by a bow shock driven by the probably expanding cavity into the intracluster gas . </S>",
    "<S> there is a metallicity gradient in the x - ray emitting gas , with the highest metallicities ( @xmath18 solar ) found close to the center , decreasing to @xmath19  solar in the outer parts . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to derive a total cluster mass within 500  kpc of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for a constant and centrally decreasing temperature profile , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of x - ray emitting gas within the same radius is @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the gas fraction of the cluster within @xmath23  kpc is @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the constant and centrally decreasing temperature profiles , respectively . </S>"
