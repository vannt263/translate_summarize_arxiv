    "mrk 421 is a nearby blazar ( @xmath11 ) and one of the brightest bl lac objects given its distance of 134.1 mpc ( @xmath12 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "it was observed in @xmath2-rays by egret ( lin et al .",
    "1992 ) and it was the first extragalactic object detected at @xmath14 gev @xcite .",
    "it belongs to the class of high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) , i. e. radio - loud active galactic nuclei with high radio and optical polarization .",
    "its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is double - humped with a first peak usually in the soft to medium x - ray range , and a second one at gev - tev energies ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ; fossati et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the first hump is commonly interpreted as due to synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet , while the origin of the second peak is still uncertain . in the leptonic scenario",
    "it is interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the synchrotron ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) or external photons ( external compton , ec ) by the same population of relativistic electrons .",
    "the observed correlated variability between x - rays and tev @xmath2-rays ( maraschi et al . 1999 ; fossati et al . 2008 , wagner 2008 ) is well explained in the ssc framework ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) , whereas the ec scenario is unlikely to apply in hbls , due to the low density of ambient photons . alternatively ,",
    "hadronic models invoke proton - initiated cascades and/or proton - synchrotron emission ( aharonian 2000 , mcke et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "leptonic and hadronic scenarios for hbls predict different properties of the @xmath2-ray emission in relation to emissions in other energy bands .",
    "specifically , the hadronic models ( as opposed to the ssc ones ) predict a flatter slope of the @xmath15 mev ic emission than that of the synchrotron emission in the optical - uv energy bands .",
    "@xmath2-ray observations of flaring bl lacs and simultaneous multiwavelength data are thus the keys to investigating these two scenarios .",
    "a hard x - ray flare of mrk 421 was detected by superagile on 2008 june 10 ( costa et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this detection was later followed by a detection in @xmath2-rays ( pittori et al .",
    "2008 ) by the agile / grid ( gamma ray imaging detector ) and prompted a too observation by swift / xrt , complementing the ongoing multifrequency observing campaign of mrk 421 with webt ( optical ) , magic and veritas ( tev ) .",
    "we report on the observations and the analysis of these data , complemented by the publicly - available data from rossixte / asm ( 2 - 12 kev ) and swift / bat ( 15 - 50 kev ) , and discuss the spectral energy distribution of the source during this bright @xmath2-ray flare .",
    "agile ( tavani et al . 2008 ) is a small mission of the italian space agency for the exploration of the @xmath2-ray sky , operating in a low earth orbit since 2007 april 23 .",
    "the agile composite payload allows for simultaneous observations in the energy ranges 30 mev-30 gev and 20 - 60 kev over a very wide field of view by means of grid and the hard x - ray imager superagile , respectively .",
    "mrk 421 was observed for five days , between 2008 - 06 - 09 17:02 ut and 2008 - 06 - 15 02:17 ut .      on 2008 june 10 superagile detected enhanced hard x - ray emission from mrk 421 .",
    "the measured flux in 20 - 60 kev was found to be above 30 mcrab ( 24-hour average ) , almost an order of magnitude larger than its typical flux in quiescence .",
    "the source was at @xmath16 degrees in the orthogonal superagile reference frame ( feroci et al .",
    "2007 ) , thus exposing an effective area @xmath17 of the full on - axis value . in the following days , the flux increased up to about 55 mcrab .",
    "the 5-day 20 - 60 kev superagile light curve is shown in fig .",
    "1c . using the publicly available light curves for this source from the bat experiment in the 15 - 50 kev energy range ( near the superagile bandpass ) , we calculated daily averages of the sparse observations .",
    "this allowed us to obtain good coverage also before and after the agile observation ( black squares in fig .",
    "1c ) , revealing that superagile indeed observed the maximum brightness of this hard x - ray flare . both superagile and bat count rates were converted to physical units by assuming a crab - like spectrum .",
    "superagile photon - by - photon data allows extraction of a time - averaged energy spectrum from the mask - convolved data .",
    "given the lack of substantial spectral variability in the superagile / asm hardness ratio ( fig.1e ) we accumulated the average energy spectrum from the data of the last 4 days of the observations , when the source flux varied between 35 and 55 mcrab , for a total net source exposure of @xmath18 ks . despite poor statistics ,",
    "this 4-point energy spectrum is able to reasonably constrain the photon index of a simple power law , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , 2 dof ) .",
    "the average flux is @xmath21 erg @xmath22 ( ( @xmath23 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the grid data were analyzed using the agile standard pipeline ( vercellone et .",
    "al 2008 ) , with a bin - size of @xmath24 .",
    "only events flagged as @xmath2-rays and not recorded while the satellite crosses the south atlantic anomaly were accepted .",
    "we also rejected all events with reconstructed direction within @xmath25 from the earth limb thus reducing contamination from earth s @xmath2-ray albedo .",
    "mrk 421 , observed @xmath720@xmath26 off - axis with respect to the boresight , was not detected on daily time scales , implying a daily - averaged flux smaller than @xmath27 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 , similar to what observed by egret @xcite . a 4.5-@xmath28 significance in the range 100 mev-10 gev resulted from an integration over the whole 5-day period ( net exposure @xmath29 ks ) .",
    "the measured flux is ( @xmath30 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 , about @xmath73 times higher than the average flux detected by egret ( @xmath31 , @xcite ) and @xmath71.5 times higher than , but still consistent , with the highest flux ( @xmath32 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 observed during the viewing period 326 .",
    "the short duration of the agile observation did not allow us to follow the possible decay of the @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "due to the relative faintness of the source and the short exposure , the grid data do not allow us to extract a reliable energy spectrum .",
    "following the superagile detection , on 2008 june 12 we triggered a too observation with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) that promptly observed the source for @xmath33ks between 2008 june 12 19:33:20 ut ( mjd 54629.8 ) and june 13 at 01:57:37 ut ( mjd 54630.1 ) .",
    "the xrt data were processed using the standard procedure ( xrtpipeline v0.12.0 ) developed at the asi science data center and distributed by the nasa / heasarc .",
    "observations were taken in window timing mode at a count rate of 120150 cts s@xmath6 .",
    "we selected xrt grades 02 ( burrows et al . 2005 ) and extracted the wt data in a rectangular 40@xmath3420-pixel region centered on the source .",
    "the background was also extracted within a box ( 40@xmath3420-pixel ) , far from background sources . due to calibration uncertainties , we restricted our spectral fit to the energy range 0.79.0  kev and added a 3% systematics to the model ( cusumano et al .",
    "the xrt spectral data are well described by an absorbed log - parabolic model .",
    "a joint fit of the xrt and superagile spectral data using the 4-day average spectrum described in sect .",
    "2.1.1 . used the log - parabolic model with galactic absorption ( @xmath35@xmath5 ; lockman & savage 1995 ) , defined as :    @xmath36 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6    where @xmath37 is the photon index at 1 kev and @xmath38 is the curvature parameter ( massaro et al .",
    "2004 ; massaro et al .",
    "this model usually describes adequately the featureless and curved spectrum in hbls .",
    "the joint fit provides @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41=1.4 , 763 dof ) , which implies a peak energy @xmath42 kev , and predicts @xmath43erg@xmath5s@xmath6 ( or @xmath44 photons@xmath5s@xmath6 ) and @xmath45erg@xmath5s@xmath6 ( ( @xmath46 photons@xmath5s@xmath6 ) , comparable to the stand - alone superagile best fit .",
    "given the high flux observed by swift / xrt , we retrieved the public light curves provided by the asm to trace the evolution of the soft x - rays during the agile observation .",
    "1b shows the daily light curve of mrk 421 in the energy range 2 - 12 kev , obtained by properly averaging the dwell - by - dwell data .    the emission at soft x - rays is well correlated with hard x - ray emission .",
    "the asm data show that the xrt observation took place when the source was at its maximum emission at soft x - rays ( mjd @xmath7 54630 ) . comparing the relative intensity of the two flares in fig .",
    "1 , it appears that the second peak is significantly harder than the first one .",
    "this is also shown in fig .",
    "1e , where we computed the daily - averaged hardness ratio between hard ( 1560 kev ) and soft ( 212 kev ) x - rays .",
    "the source appears to have undergone the hardest part of this double - humped flare just during the agile @xmath2-ray detection .",
    "the 4-telescope array veritas ( acciari et al . 2008 ) at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( arizona ) and the single - dish instrument magic ( baixeras et al .",
    "2004 ; tescaro et al .",
    "2007 ) at la palma are imaging air cherenkov telescopes covering an energy range from @xmath15 gev to some tens of tev .",
    "the instruments have a typical energy resolution of @xmath4720% ( veritas ) and 2030% ( magic ) , and event - by - event angular resolution of @xmath47 0.14@xmath48 .",
    "wobble - mode observations ( daum et al . 1997 ) at an 0.4@xmath48 offset from the camera center were taken on five nights from 2008 june 38 with magic at zenith angles ( za ) between 28@xmath48 and 48@xmath48 and on 4 nights ( may 27 , june 1 , 5 , 6 ) with veritas ( wobble offset : 0.5@xmath48 ) at za between 32@xmath48 and 40@xmath48 during partial moon light conditions .",
    "the total live - time after applying quality selection is 2.95 and 1.17 hours with magic and veritas , respectively .",
    "the data were analyzed using the magic ( albert et al .",
    "2008a ) and veritas ( daniel et al .",
    "2007 ; acciari et al .",
    "2008 ) standard calibration and analyses and image parameters ( hillas 1985 ) . for veritas , the @xmath2-ray direction and air shower impact parameter on the ground are reconstructed using the stereoscopic techniques in hofmann et al . ( 1999 ) and krawczynski et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "any @xmath2-ray excess is derived from the @xmath49 distribution , where @xmath50 represents the angular distance between the source position in the sky and the reconstructed arrival position of the air shower .",
    "for magic , @xmath50 is estimated using the disp method ( fomin et al . 1994 ) . for veritas ,",
    "99.9% of the background of cosmic - rays is rejected by using selection cuts on @xmath49 , mean scaled width and length , and by using quality cuts of each event.the magic analysis utilizes a random forest method ( albert et al .",
    "2008b ) to discriminate the dominating background of hadronic cosmic - ray events and for the energy estimation of the @xmath2-ray events .",
    "the energy and effective area of each event is reconstructed from monte carlo simulations . the integral flux and energy spectrum of the source",
    "is then derived from the effective areas for nights with a significant detection .",
    "two independent analyses of both the magic and veritas data sets yielded consistent results . in total , a signal corresponding to a significance level of @xmath51 ( veritas ) and @xmath52 ( magic ) is obtained by following eq .",
    "17 of li & ma ( 1983 ) .",
    "the combined magic - veritas data ( fig .",

    "the veritas energy spectrum for june 6 is provided . a power law fit over the energy range 0.35 tev resulted in a @xmath41=0.7 with a photon index @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the intrinsic @xmath2-ray spectrum at the source reconstructed by removing attenuation effects by the extragalactic background light ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) following the procedure of raue & mazin ( 2008 ) ( ) . fitting a power law to the intrinsic spectrum yields a photon index @xmath54 , which is not significantly harder than the measured spectrum due to the relatively low redshift z @xmath55 0.031 .",
    "mrk 421 is one of the 28 @xmath2-ray - loud blazars that are regularly monitored by the glast - agile support program ( gasp ; villata et al .",
    "2008 ) of the whole earth blazar telescope ( webt ) .",
    "the gasp observations started in early 2007 november .",
    "the @xmath56-band data were calibrated according to the photometric sequence by villata et al .",
    "a careful data analysis is warranted because the source flux is contaminated by the emission of the host galaxy and nearby objects .",
    "the flux contribution of these objects was subtracted according to nilsson et al .",
    "moreover , we corrected for a galactic extinction of @xmath57 mag . the resulting @xmath56-band light curve during the period considered in this paper is shown in fig .",
    "1a .    during the swift pointing on 2008 june 1213 ,",
    "the uvot ( poole et al . 2008 ) instrument observed mrk 421 in the uvw1 and uvw2 photometric bands .",
    "the uvotsource tool is used to extract counts , correct for coincidence losses , apply background subtraction , and calculate the source flux .",
    "we applied a standard 5 arcsec radius source aperture , and a 20 arcsec background region .",
    "the source fluxes are dereddened using the interstellar extinction curve in fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) .",
    "mrk 421 showed a very interesting broad - band activity during the first half of 2008 june as derived from agile data combined with those of webt , swift , magic and veritas . using our multi - frequency data we were able to derive time - resolved seds ( fig .",
    "we distinguish two time periods : _ period 1 _ : 2008 june 6 , with the inclusion of optical , x - ray ( xte and bat ) and tev data ( veritas ) ; and _ period 2 _ : 2008 june 915 , including optical , uv , x - rays ( xrt and superagile ) and gamma - ray data ( agile ) .",
    "the source shows a very interesting time - variable broad band emission that appears to be in overall agreement with an ssc model .",
    "the optical , soft and hard x - ray bands strongly constrain the sed around the synchrotron peak , and its daily variability reveals the physical processes of mrk  421 .",
    "possible correlated variability is shown in fig .  1 between the optical ( an overall decreasing trend with superimposed spikes of emission ) , the x - rays ( several emission peaks lasting few days ) , and the high - energy parts of the spectrum . based on the physical constraints obtained for the synchrotron peak",
    ", we can model both the he and vhe @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "the data collection and broad - band sed extends over 12 decades in energy .",
    "taking advantage of the overlapping magic and veritas observations , we present a combined vhe light curve using the current generation of northern imaging air cherenkov systems .",
    "we first model the synchrotron peak of emission using the period 1 optical , soft and hard x - ray data .",
    "the short time - variability ( fig .",
    "1 ) constrains the size of the emitting region to @xmath58 cm .",
    "hence , we consider a one - zone ssc model ( tavecchio et al .",
    "1998 ) based on a blob of comoving size @xmath59 cm , with a relativistic doppler factor @xmath60 and characterized by non - thermal comoving electron energy distribution function described by a double power law : @xmath61 where the comoving lorentz factor ( @xmath2 ) varies in the range @xmath62 , the normalization ( density ) constant @xmath63 @xmath64 , and the break energy @xmath65 and with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , the low - energy and high - energy power - law indices , respectively ( see table 1 ) . with these parameters we found that the data for period 1 are best fitted with a comoving magnetic field @xmath68",
    "g.    variability may be caused by several factors ; we consider two cases : ( a ) hardening / softening of the electron energy distribution function caused by particle acceleration processes ; ( b ) increase / decrease of the comoving particle density , as a consequence of additional particle injection / loss by shock processes .",
    "we expect tev variability to be comparable with the x - ray one if case ( a ) applies : this is because the emission is in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "alternately , for case ( b ) we expect the tev relative variability ( @xmath69 ) to be a factor of 2 greater than that of the x - ray flux variability .",
    "our agile , magic and veritas data appear to support case ( a ) .",
    "we compare the seds for period 1 and period 2 , to better assess the spectral evolution . in fig .",
    "2 we show our optimized modelling of the time - resolved synchrotron peak and consequent ssc high - energy emission for the period 1 as well as for 2008 june 1213 of the period 2 . in the last case ,",
    "the adopted model parameters are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xmath64 .",
    "our model predicts an even larger tev flux for period 2 ( no tev observations exist , however ) than detected in period 1 .    a detailed discussion of the complex optical vs. x - ray variability of mrk  421 as shown in fig .",
    "1 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we notice here a few remarkable points .",
    "the optical light curve shows variations of the order of @xmath74 on a time scale @xmath7few days , superimposed on a long decay during the entire period .",
    "individual soft and hard x - ray peaks result in increased fluxes by a factor of @xmath72.5 and @xmath75 , respectively : no long term decay appears .",
    "this different behaviour of the x - ray radiation and the bulk of the optical emission may interestingly suggest a more complex scenarios than a ) and b ) ones : optical and x radiation comes from two different jet regions , each one characterized by its own variability .",
    "a possible scenarios is one in which the inner jet region would produce the x - rays and it would be at least partially transparent to the optical radiation .",
    "in contrast , the outer region can only produce lower - frequency emission .",
    "the signature of the x - ray events visible in the optical light curve would come from the inner region and would be diluted by the optical radiation emitted from the outer region ( see villata & raiteri 1999 for the case of mrk 501 ; villata et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "interestingly , the 2 - 10 kev flux measured by xrt on june 12  13 , @xmath75 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 , is higher than all previous observations ( @xmath76 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ; fossati et al .",
    "2008 ; lichti et al .",
    "a joint analysis of the xrt and superagile data , covering the range from 0.7 to 60 kev , provides a best - fit spectral model consistent with a log - parabolic shape , with parameters implying a peak energy @xmath7 3 kev , in good agreement with the steeper positive correlation between the peak energy and the maximum of the sed found by tramacere et al .",
    "2007 ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) , although our value of the peak energy shows a significant shift with respect to typical values of 0.5 - 1 kev for this source .",
    "we conclude our analysis of the broad - band variable emission from mrk  421 by emphasizing that our multi - telescope / instrument data show a very interesting variability that provides support for an ssc model of the source .",
    "the @xmath2-ray emission detected by agile during period 2 and the tev emission detected during period 1 can be successfully modelled from the characteristics of the corresponding synchrotron peaks .",

    "<S> we present optical , x - ray , high energy ( @xmath0 gev ) and very high energy ( @xmath1 gev ; vhe ) observations of the high - frequency peaked blazar mrk 421 taken between 2008 may 24 and june 23 . </S>",
    "<S> a high energy @xmath2-ray signal was detected by agile with @xmath3 on june 915 , with @xmath4 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this flaring state is brighter than the average flux observed by egret by a factor of @xmath73 , but still consistent with the highest egret flux . in hard x - rays </S>",
    "<S> ( 20 - 60 kev ) superagile resolved a 5-day flare ( june 9 - 15 ) peaking at @xmath7 55 mcrab . </S>",
    "<S> superagile , rxte / asm and swift / bat data show a correlated flaring structure between soft and hard x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> hints of the same flaring behavior are also detected in the simultaneous optical data provided by the gasp - webt . </S>",
    "<S> a swift / xrt observation near the flaring maximum revealed the highest 2 - 10 kev flux ever observed from this source , of @xmath8 @xmath9 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath10 mcrab ) . </S>",
    "<S> a peak synchrotron energy of @xmath73 kev was derived , higher than typical values of @xmath70.5 - 1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> vhe observations with magic and veritas on june 6 - 8 show the flux peaking in a bright state , well correlated with the x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> this extraordinary set of simultaneous data , covering a twelve - decade spectral range , allowed for a deep analysis of the spectral energy distribution as well as of correlated light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-ray flare can be interpreted within the framework of the synchrotron self - compton model in terms of a rapid acceleration of leptons in the jet . </S>"
