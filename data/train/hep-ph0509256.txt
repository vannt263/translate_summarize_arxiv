    "<S> measurements by the belle collaboration of the exclusive @xmath0 and inclusive @xmath1 productions in @xmath2 annihilation differ substantially from theoretical predictions based on the nonrelativistic qcd factorization approach . in order to test </S>",
    "<S> if such a discrepancy is originated from the large perturbative corrections to the hard - scattering amplitude , we study inclusive production of four charm hadrons in @xmath3 annihilation at @xmath4 factories .    </S>",
    "<S> 5ex    the nonrelativistic qcd  ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism@xcite has enjoyed considerable success in describing production and decay rates of heavy quarkonia . </S>",
    "<S> the approach provides an infrared - safe prediction for the @xmath5-wave quarkonium decay@xcite and explains the large empirical cross sections of prompt charmonia at the fermilab tevatron.@xcite however , there are a few serious challenges to nrqcd . </S>",
    "<S> the first issue is the discrepancy between the nrqcd prediction and the cdf data for the polarization of prompt @xmath6 in large-@xmath7 bins.@xcite the measurement also confronts with a recent lattice nrqcd calculation , which supports the dominance of transverse @xmath6.@xcite the second issue is for the @xmath6 production in @xmath3 annihilation at @xmath4-factories . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections for exclusive production of @xmath0 in @xmath3 annihilation measured by the belle collaboration@xcite and by the babar collaboration@xcite are greater than nrqcd predictions of leading - order qcd@xcite by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> a few proposals@xcite introduced to solve the problem were disfavored by a recent experimental analysis.@xcite the next - to - leading - order qcd corrections to the exclusive process have been found to be as large as 80%@xcite of the leading - order prediction.@xcite it is argued that nonperturbative corrections may be large.@xcite however , these corrections are not yet sufficient to explain the data . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to see if such a large perturbative correction is also true in inclusive production of four charm hadrons,@xcite having a similar parton - level process .    </S>",
    "<S> another large discrepancy between the nrqcd prediction and the @xmath4-factory data is for the inclusive prompt @xmath8 production cross section @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> measured cross section@xcite is significantly larger than the nrqcd predictions.@xcite in order to find if an alternative way could resolve the problem , a process@xcite was recently studied within the color - evaporation model  ( cem ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cem prediction for the cross section @xmath9 was reportedly smaller than the empirical value by about two orders of magnitude.@xcite a more comprehensive discussion of the cem can be found in refs .. the belle collaboration also measured the fraction @xmath10 $ ] of the process within inclusive @xmath6 production . </S>",
    "<S> the measured value , @xmath10_{\\textrm{belle}}=% 0.82\\pm 0.15\\pm 0.14$],@xcite is significantly larger than the nrqcd predictions of about @xmath11% . in the cem </S>",
    "<S> , there is only a single universal nonperturbative factor , which perfectly cancels in the ratio @xmath10 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cem prediction for the ratio is expected to be more reliable than the absolute values for the cross sections in the numerator and the denominator . here </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review the production of four charm hadrons in @xmath3 annihilation at @xmath4 factories .    </S>",
    "<S> 5ex    since the inclusive four charm hadron production involves the same feynman diagrams for exclusive @xmath12 production , measuring the cross section will provide an important information in the estimating the size of the short - distance coefficient for @xmath12 cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we present @xmath13 prediction in leading order of strong coupling constant , @xmath14 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our predictions for the inclusive four charm hadron cross sections in @xmath3 annihilation at @xmath1510.6  gev depending on the charm quark mass @xmath16 is shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for @xmath17 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath201.5  gev @xmath2197  fb . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section varies from @xmath22  pb at @xmath201.2  gev to @xmath23  fb at @xmath201.8  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section decreases as @xmath16 increases mainly because available phase space shrinks . if one can increase the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy of the @xmath3 , the @xmath16 dependence will decrease .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) we show the differential cross section with respect to the invariant mass of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the prediction for @xmath25 in leading order in @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this differential cross section can be compared with the @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are charm hadrons , which do not include anticharm .    </S>",
    "<S> 5ex    with @xmath30\\approx 0.1 $ ]  pb and current integrated luminocity @xmath31  fb@xmath32 we expect roughly 30 events will be detected by the belle detector . </S>",
    "<S> if our leading - order prediction is comparable to the measured value , it is very probable that the qcd higher - order corrections to the @xmath12 cross section is small . </S>",
    "<S> then the large discrepancy in @xmath12 cross section may be due to the violation of factorization or existence of new production mechanism . if the measured cross section for the four charm hadron inclusive production is much larger than our prediction like the case of @xmath12 , it is very likely that perturbative qcd corrections to @xmath12 cross section is large enough to explain the discrepancy , which leads to the failure of reliability in perturbative expansion . </S>"
