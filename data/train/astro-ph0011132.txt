    "the early discovery phase for l dwarfs and t dwarfs has ended and a major focus is now on their characterization .",
    "the atmospheres of brown dwarfs are dominated by h@xmath0 , h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , nh@xmath2 , the neutral alkali metals , and grains , but how theory translates this basic knowledge into effective temperatures , gravities , and compositions has yet to be determined . establishing the spectral and color diagnostics that are most appropriate for l / t studies",
    "is complicated by ambiguities in the cloud / grain models and a paucity of opacity data . in particular , though t dwarfs are being informally defined by their methane features at 1.7 and 2.2 , the methane database itself is far from complete .",
    "the methane opacities on the red side of the @xmath3 band are certainly in error by a factor of 3 to 5 ( witness gliese 229b@xcite ) and the hot bands are completely missing .",
    "the latter means that even the sign of the opacity s dependence upon temperature can be in error .",
    "nevertheless , there has been great overall progress towards understanding what makes these objects unique and what their spectra are telling us . in this paper ,",
    "i sidestep a comprehensive study of these issues and summarize three interesting topics in brown dwarf theory that have emerged of late .",
    "they are 1 ) what determines t dwarf spectra shortward of 1.0 micron , 2 ) what is the true color of a  brown \" dwarf , and 3 ) what is the effect of heavy element depletion ( `` rainout '' ) on the abundance profiles of the neutral alkali metal atoms .",
    "a subtext of this contribution is the central importance of the alkali metals in spectrum formation .",
    "employing the scheme of burrows , marley , and sharp@xcite ( hereafter bms ) , we can derive the neutral alkali opacities as a function of wavelength .",
    "figure 1 depicts the abundance - weighted opacities of the dominant neutral alkali metal lines at 1500 k and 1 bar .",
    "this opacity spectrum has a bearing on the suggestion by bms that the strong continuum absorption seen in all t dwarf spectra in the near - infrared from 0.8 to 1.0 , previously interpreted as due to an anomalous population of red grains@xcite or in part due to high - altitude silicate clouds@xcite , is most probably due to the strong red wings of the k i doublet at @xmath47700  .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 2 , in which several possible theoretical spectra are compared with the observed spectrum for gliese 229b in the near - infrared@xcite .",
    "tsuji @xcite also identified the k i doublet as one of the agents of absorption shortward of one micron , but they needed silicate grains as well to reproduce the gliese 229b observations .",
    "bms conclude that the k i resonance doublet alone is responsible , though , given the remaining ambiguity in its line shape , one ca nt completely eliminate the presence of grains as secondary agents .        ) in millijanskys versus wavelength ( @xmath5 ) in microns from 0.5 to 1.45 for gliese 229 b , according to leggett @xcite ( heavy solid ) , and for four theoretical models ( light solid ) described in bms . also included",
    "is a model , denoted  clear \" ( dotted ) , without alkali metals and without any ad hoc absorber due to grains or haze .",
    "the horizontal bars near 0.7 and 0.8 denote the wfpc2 @xmath6 and @xmath7 band measurements of golimowski @xcite .",
    "figure taken from bms.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as figure 2 suggests , the bms theory also explains the wfpc2 @xmath7 band ( m@xmath820.76 ; theory = 21.0 ) and @xmath6 band ( @xmath9 ; theory = 23.6 ) measurements made of gl 229b@xcite , with the na d lines at 5890   helping to determine the strength of the @xmath6 band .",
    "bms predicted not only that there would be a large trough in a t dwarf spectrum at 7700   due to the k i resonance , but that the spectrum of a t dwarf would peak between the na d and k i absorption troughs at 5890   and 7700  , respectively .",
    "this prediction was recently verified by liebert @xcite for the t dwarf sdss 1624 + 00 .",
    "furthermore , the 1.17 and 1.24 subordinate lines of excited k i have been identified in t dwarfs@xcite . since these subordinate lines are on the crown of the @xmath10 band , they allow one to probe the deeper layers at higher temperatures .",
    "figure 3 portrays for a representative gl 229b model the dependence on wavelength of the `` brightness '' temperature , here defined as the temperature at which the photon optical depth is @xmath11 .",
    "such plots clearly reveal the temperature layers probed with spectra and provide a means to qualitatively gauge composition profiles .",
    "specifically , for the gl 229b model , the detection of the subordinate lines of potassium indicates that we are there probing to @xmath41600 k , while the detection of the fundamental methane band at @xmath12 ( not shown in figure 3 ) means that we are probing to only @xmath4600 k.    .",
    "the identity of the alkali metal atom responsible for a given feature is indicated .",
    "see text for discussion .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "figure 1 shows that the na d doublet should dominate the optical portion of the spectrum .",
    "since it suppresses the green wavelengths and `` brown '' is two parts red , one part green , and very little blue , brown dwarfs should not be brown .",
    "in fact , our recent calculations suggest that they are red to purple , depending upon the exact shape of the line wings of na d , the abundance of the alkalis , the presence of high - altitude clouds , and the role of water clouds at lower ( @xmath13 500 k ) . a mixture of red and the complementary color to the yellow of the na d line makes physical sense .",
    "it is the _ complementary _ color , not the _ color _ , of the na d line(s ) because na d is seen in absorption , not emission .",
    "indeed , the recent measurement of the spectrum of the l5 dwarf 2massw j1507 from 0.4 to 1.0 ( i.n .",
    "reid and j.d .",
    "kirkpatrick , in preparation ) indicates that this l dwarf is magenta in ( optical ) color .",
    "this is easily shown with a program that generates the rgb equivalent of a given optical spectrum ( in this instance , r : g : b::1.0:0.3:0.42 , depending upon the video `` gamma '' ) . hence , after a quarter century of speculation and ignorance",
    ", we now have a handle on the true color of a brown dwarf  and it is not brown .",
    "as shown by burrows and sharp@xcite , fegley and lodders@xcite , and lodders@xcite , the alkali metals are less refractory than ti , v , ca , si , al , fe , and mg and survive in abundance as neutral atoms in substellar atmospheres to temperatures of 1000 k to 1500 k. this is below the 1600 k to 2500 k temperature range in which the silicates , iron , the titanates , corundum , and spinel , etc . condense and rainout .",
    "the rainout of refractory elements such as silicon and aluminum ensures that na and k are not sequestered in the feldspars high albite ( naalsi@xmath2o@xmath14 ) and sanadine ( kalsi@xmath2o@xmath14 ) at temperatures at and below 1400 k , but are in their elemental form down to @xmath41000 k. hence , in the depleted atmospheres of the cool t dwarfs and late l dwarfs , alkali metals quite naturally come into their own .",
    "figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the role of rainout by depicting the profiles of the relative abundances of the main reservoirs of the alkali metals , with and without rainout as crudely defined in reference @xcite .",
    "as is clear from a comparison of these two figures , rainout and depletion of heavy metals can result in a significant enhancement in the abundances at altitude ( lower temperatures ) of the neutral alkali metal atoms , in particular sodium and potassium .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates the naturalness with which the potassium resonance lines alone fit the observed near - infrared / optical spectrum of gl 229b .",
    "curiously , in the metal - depleted atmospheres of t dwarfs the reach of the k i doublet is one of the broadest in astrophysics , its far wings easily extending more than 1500   to the red and blue . with rainout , below @xmath41000",
    "k both sodium and potassium exist as sulfides ( na@xmath0s and k@xmath0s)@xcite . without rainout , complete chemical equilibrium at low temperatures requires that sodium and potassium reside in the feldspars . if such compounds formed and persisted at altitude , then the nascent alkali metals would be less visible , particularly in t dwarfs . by modeling spectra with and without the rainout of the refractories and comparing to the emerging library of t dwarf spectra@xcite , the degree of rainout and the alkali composition profiles in brown dwarf atmospheres can be approximately ascertained .",
    "l and t dwarf spectra are unique among  stars \" and require new databases , approaches , and thinking to fully understand . exploring as we are new worlds , we will require new tools and instincts with which to navigate .",
    "along with accurate cloud models , methane , and water , the alkali metals hold the key to unraveling the mysteries of the substellar objects that we now know inhabit the solar neighborhood in abundance .",
    "i thank my long - time collaborators , jonathan lunine , bill hubbard , and mark marley , for simulating input and both davy kirkpatrick and neill reid for an advanced glimpse at their stunning 2massw j1507 spectrum .",
