    "magnetised plasma dynamics lies at the heart of many fascinating phenomena in astro , space and laboratory physics .",
    "turbulence in the solar wind  @xcite and in the interstellar medium  @xcite , solar  @xcite , stellar  @xcite and accretion disk flares  @xcite , substorms in the earth s magnetosphere  @xcite , and turbulent transport and instabilities in magnetised fusion experiments  @xcite , are just a few examples of remarkable physics problems whose solution is indeed determined by understanding the behaviour of plasmas in a magnetised environment .    in many of these cases ,",
    "( i ) the collision frequency is much lower than the typical frequencies of the physical phenomena of interest ( e.g. , turbulence , magnetic reconnection )  i.e. , the plasmas are weakly collisional ; and ( ii ) the size of the ion larmor orbit is several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the system .",
    "weak collisionality implies that on the timescales of interest the plasma can not be treated as a fluid , and instead a kinetic description that evolves the particles distribution functions is required .",
    "this is rather unfortunate from the computational point of view , since fully kinetic models live on a six - dimensional phase - space ( each particle is characterised by its position and velocity vectors ) .",
    "the strong magnetisation , however , implies that the plasma is highly anisotropic , with very different particle motions along and across the magnetic field direction .",
    "this anisotropy can be explored analytically to yield reduced kinetic models , i.e. , asymptotic descriptions that reduce the phase - space to only 5d or even 4d .",
    "this leads to tremendous computational savings and effectively renders possible calculations that would otherwise not be feasible on today s supercomputers .",
    "gyrokinetics  @xcite is a rigorous description of strongly magnetised , weakly - collisional plasmas .",
    "the key idea behind the gyrokinetic formalism is that , because of the strong magnetic ( guide ) field , the particles larmor gyration frequency is much higher than the frequencies of dynamical interest , and can thus be averaged over .",
    "this allows for the reduction of the dimensionality of the system , from 6d ( three position and three velocity coordinates ) to 5d ( three position coordinates , and velocities parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field ) while retaining all the essential physical effects .",
    "gyrokinetics was originally motivated by the attempt to model microinstabilities in magnetic fusion experiments ; in this respect it has been rather successful  @xcite . as recognition of its usefulness",
    ", the range of applications of gyrokinetics has broadened in recent years ; it is now routinely applied to the study of turbulence in magnetised astrophysical systems  @xcite , and there have also been some studies pioneering its application to the problem of magnetic reconnection  @xcite .",
    "this reduction of the dimensionality of the system allowed by gyrokinetics is extremely advantageous from the numerical point of view .",
    "nonetheless , intrinsically multiscale problems such as kinetic turbulence and reconnection remain formidable computational challenges .",
    "further simplification where possible is therefore desirable .",
    "one possible such simplification of gyrokinetics has recently been proposed by zocco and schekochihin  @xcite : the kinetic reduced electron heating model ( krehm ) , a rigorous asymptotic limit of gyrokinetics valid for plasmas such that [ krehm_order ] _",
    "e~m_e / m_i , where @xmath0 is the electron beta , @xmath1 are the background electron density and temperature , respectively , and @xmath2 is the background magnetic field .",
    "under this assumption , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that it is possible to reduce the plasma dynamics to a 4d phase - space  position and velocity parallel to the magnetic field  while retaining key physics such as phase - mixing and electron landau damping , ion finite larmor radius effects , electron inertia , electron collisions and ohmic resistivity .",
    "this is a very significant simplification of the full kinetic description , which renders possible truly multiscale kinetic simulations . in particular , because no _ ad hoc _ fluid closure is employed , krehm can be used for detailed studies of energy conversion and dissipation in kinetic turbulence and reconnection , including electron heating via phase - mixing and landau damping .    if taken literally , the ordering imposed by is somewhat restrictive , and obviously excludes many plasmas of interest .",
    "examples of plasmas where it may hold are some regions of the solar corona  @xcite , the large plasma device ( lapd ) experiment at ucla  @xcite , and edge regions in some tokamaks  @xcite does tend to be rather low in this region . ] .",
    "however , one may legitimately expect that the plasma behaviour captured by krehm will qualitatively hold beyond its rigorous limits of applicability , as is so often the case with many other simplified plasma models ( mhd being a notorious example of a description known to work rather well far outside its strict limits of validity ) .",
    "hints that this may indeed be the case are offered in  , where a direct comparison of krehm with a ( non - reduced ) gyrokinetic model for the linear collisionless tearing mode problem yields very good agreement at values of @xmath3 significantly larger than @xmath4 .",
    "this paper reports on the numerical methods and algorithms used in , the first numerical code to solve this particular set of equations .",
    "an extensive series of tests and benchmarks is also presented .",
    "considerable attention is devoted to orszag - tang - type decaying turbulence , both in the fluid and kinetic regimes .",
    "the reader interested in the application of this code and physics model to the problem of magnetic reconnection is referred to  @xcite , where the importance of electron heating via landau damping in reconnection is demonstrated for the first time .",
    "a second set of equations solved by  are the kinetic reduced mhd ( krmhd ) equations  @xcite , which describe the evolution of compressible fluctuations ( density and parallel magnetic field ) in the regime @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being the wave number perpendicular to the guide - field of a typical perturbation , and @xmath7 the ion larmor radius . )",
    "these equations are structurally identical to those of krehm , so their numerical implementation in  is straightforward .",
    "we also note that krehm reduces to the standard reduced - mhd ( rmhd ) set of equations  @xcite in the appropriate limit ( i.e. , when the wave length of the fluctuations is much larger than all the kinetic scales ) .",
    "thus ,  can also be used as a rmhd code ( in either 2d or 3d slab geometry ) .",
    "finally , we remark that under an isothermal closure for the electrons , krehm reduces to the simple two - field gyrofluid model treated in refs .",

    "the kinetic equations are solved by means of a hermite expansion , which requires some form of closure ( or truncation ) .",

    "presents the energy evolution equation for the closed krehm model ; and the normalizations that we adopt are laid out in .",

    "the perturbed electron distribution function , to lowest order in @xmath9 , and in the gyrokinetic expansion , is defined as [ delta_f_e ] f_e= g_e + ( n_e / n_0e+2v_u_e / v_the^2)f_0e , where @xmath10 is the equilibrium maxwellian , @xmath11 is the electron thermal speed , @xmath12 is the velocity coordinate parallel to the guide - field direction , @xmath13 is the electron density perturbation ( the zeroth moment of @xmath14 ) , and [ uepar ] u_e =- j_/n_0e e=(e / c m_e)d_e^2_^2is the parallel electron flow ( the first moment of @xmath14 ) . in this expression , @xmath15 is the parallel current and @xmath16 is the parallel component of the vector potential ( note that , in this model , the parallel ion flow is zero to the order that is kept in the expansion ) ; and @xmath17 is the electron skin depth , where @xmath18 is the electron plasma frequency .",

    "an important observation is that it does not contain an explicit dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "if such a dependence is not introduced by the collision operator @xmath27 $ ] , then @xmath38 can be integrated out , and the reduced electron distribution function becomes effectively 4d only , @xmath39 .",
    "the use of a hermite polynomial expansion of the distribution function is a well - known technique to simplify the numerical solution of kinetic equations such as  ( [ eq : ge ] )  @xcite  see  @xcite in particular for an insightful discussion of this approach .",
    "a very convenient aspect of the hermite formulation is that it enables a spectral representation of velocity space , a highly - desirable property when the available resolution is limited ( as is almost invariably the case ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out , furthermore , that the advantages of the hermite representation transcend the numerical aspects , as it often enables one to make analytical headway in problems that are otherwise too complex : see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "perhaps for both these reasons , hermite formulations have gathered considerable interest recently ; we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a very comprehensive overview of recent and past work on the subject .    the hermite expansion of @xmath20 is defined by [ hermite_expansion ] g_e(x , y , z , v_,t)=_m=2^h_m@xmath40 g_m ( x , y , z , t)f_0e(v _ ) , where @xmath41 denotes the hermite polynomial of order @xmath42 and @xmath43 is its coefficient .",

    "eid_e^2 .    in the hermite formulation ,",
    "@xmath42 is the velocity - space equivalent of @xmath48 in the usual fourier representation of position space .",
    "thus , for example , the formation of fine scale structures in velocity space ( as arises from phase - mixing ) can be conveniently thought of as a transfer of energy to high @xmath42 s , much in the same way as the formation of fine scales in real space leads to energy being transferred to high wave numbers @xmath48 in the usual fourier representation . on the other hand",
    ", the hermite representation introduces a closure problem , in that the equation for @xmath43 couples to the higher order moment @xmath49 .",
    "we shall see in , however , that a rigorous , nonlinear closure can be obtained .",
    "the well known reduced mhd ( rmhd ) equations  @xcite can be obtained from   by taking the collisional limit @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath6 represent the typical frequencies and perpendicular wave numbers of the fluctuations , and @xmath53 is the ion sound larmor radius .    in this limit , the isothermal approximation , @xmath54 , applies , and thus   decouples from . for @xmath55 , becomes [ eq : rmhd - poisson ] = , where we have defined @xmath56 to make contact with the standard terminology .",
    "further defining @xmath57 , we obtain : + @xmath58 & = & v_a+ @xmath59 , [ eq : vorticity ] + + @xmath60&= & + v_a , [ eq : epar ] where @xmath61 is the alfvn speed based on the guide - field , @xmath62 .",
    "a different set of equations solved by   is the kinetic reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( krmhd ) model , derived by expanding the gyrokinetic equation in terms of the small parameter @xmath63  @xcite  in this sense , it is the long wavelength limit of gyrokinetics . in this limit , the alfvnic component of the turbulent fluctuations decouples from the compressive component .",
    "the dynamics of the system are completely determined by the alfvnic fluctuations , which are governed by the reduced mhd .",
    "the compressive fluctuations , on the other hand , evolve according to a kinetic equation : + v_g & = & d v_g , [ eq : slowmodekin ] where @xmath64 is related to the perturbed ion distribution function [ see equation ( 183 ) of schekochihin  @xcite ] and @xmath65 is a one dimensional maxwellian . the parameter @xmath66 is a linear combination of the physical parameters ion - to - electron temperature ratio , plasma beta , and the ion charge [ see equation ( 182 ) of schekochihin  @xcite ] .    the structure of is mathematically similar to that of , the main difference being that this kinetic equation is decoupled from the alfvnic fluctuations , unlike its krehm counterpart .",
    "similar to , one obtains the following set of equations by expanding in terms of hermite polynomials : @xmath67 ,   \\quad m\\ge2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that , unlike , begin at @xmath68 .",
    "additionally , since the term on the right hand side of is proportional to the first hermite polynomial , the parameter @xmath66 makes an appearance only in the equation for @xmath69 .",
    "the hermite expansion transforms the original electron drift - kinetic equation , ( [ eq : ge ] ) , into an infinite , coupled set of fluid - like equations , ( [ eq : gms ] ) [ or , similarly for krhmd , into ] .",
    "formally , the two representations are exactly equivalent , i.e. , no information is lost by introducing the hermite representation .",
    "however , the numerical implementation of equations  ( [ eq : gms ] ) obviously requires some form of truncation , i.e. , given a certain number of hermite moments , @xmath70 , it is necessary to specify some prescription for @xmath71 . in other words , as in the derivation of any fluid set of equations , the hermite expansion introduces a closure problem .",
    "attempts to solve this problem have varied , from simply setting @xmath72 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , to polynomial closures in which @xmath71 is extrapolated from a number of previous moments  @xcite . particularly noteworthy is the approach followed by hammett and co - workers  @xcite where closures have been carefully designed to rigorously capture the linear landau damping rates ( as well as gyro - radius effects and dominant nonlinearities ) .    in the system of equations under consideration here",
    ", it turns out that an asymptotically exact closure can be obtained in the large @xmath70 limit .",
    "let us consider that the collision frequency is small but finite .",
    "then , there will be a range of @xmath42 s for which the collisional term is negligible  one may think of this as the @xmath42 inertial range : energy is injected into low @xmath42 s via the coupling with ohm s law , and cascades ( phase - mixes ) to higher @xmath42 s .",
    "however , as @xmath42 increases , a dissipation range is encountered , when the collisional term in [ or in ] is no longer subdominant with respect to the other terms . roughly speaking , in the dissipation range",
    ", energy arrives at @xmath43 from @xmath73 and is mostly dissipated there ; only an exponentially smaller fraction is passed on to @xmath49 .",
    "one thus expects that @xmath74 in the dissipation range , by definition .",
    "the implication of this is that , for @xmath75 in the dissipation range , the dominant balance in the equation for @xmath71 must be [ eq : closure ] v_theg_m-_ei(m+1 ) g_m+1 . solving this equation for @xmath71 yields the sought closure  @xcite .",
    "the equation for @xmath76 therefore becomes : [ eq : last_g ] -_e @xmath77 + v_theg_m-1 = -_eim g_m , where @xmath78 is the parallel ( spitzer ) thermal diffusivity ( i.e. , the semi - collisional limit ) , then this equation needs to include the term proportional to the electron current [ the first term on the rhs of ] , becoming equation ( 99 ) of ref .  @xcite . ] .",
    "it is easy to see how the exact same reasoning leads to the equivalent closure for .",
    "it can be useful to have an _ a priori _ estimate of the value of @xmath70 required to formally justify the asymptotic closure , for a given collision frequency .",
    "one such _ linear _",
    "estimate is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite : if the hermite spectrum is in steady - state , then the collisional cutoff , @xmath79 , can be shown to occur at  @xcite . if @xmath80 then the collisional cutoff is superseded .",
    "this does not affect any of the considerations drawn here . ] : [ m_cutoff ] m_c=@xmath81 ^ 2/3 .",
    "thus , we expect the hermite closure , , to be valid if @xmath82 .",
    "the numerical implementation of   introduces some difficulties and will be discussed in .",
    "since our primary interest lies in weakly collisional plasmas , one finds that @xmath83 .",
    "for example , a simple estimate using standard parameters for the solar corona suggests @xmath84 ; certain experiments on jet  @xcite suggest @xmath85 in the edge region , considerably smaller than for the solar corona , but still quite large .",
    "further noticing that such cases are invariably tied to a broad range of spatial scales , thereby also requiring high spatial resolutions , renders obvious the impracticability of such computations : not only must one solve a very large set of nonlinear , coupled pde s , as also the stiffness increases , due to the coefficients proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "one possibility of avoiding this problem is to artificially enhance the value of the collision frequency .",
    "note however that @xmath87 , i.e. , a relatively weak scaling , implying that cutting the number of necessary @xmath42 s down to computationally manageable sizes would require drastic increases in the collision frequency .",
    "to make matters worse , the collision operator scales only linearly with @xmath42 , implying that in fact one needs to retain @xmath88 to adequately capture the dissipation range and validate the closure .    one way to circumvent these difficulties",
    "is to make use of a ` hyper - collision ' operator , i.e. , add a term of the form @xmath89 to the rhs of . here",
    ", @xmath90 is the order of the hyper - diffusion operator ( a typical value would be @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 is a numerically - based coefficient defined such that energy arriving at @xmath75 can be dissipated in one timestep : [ hyper - coeff ] ~m^h_h g_m .",
    "thus , in practice , one may simply set  @xcite : _",
    "h=1/(m^h ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that if it is possible to choose a value of @xmath70 that is very deep into the dissipation range , then presumably the issue of which closure to implement becomes less sensitive , and it may be justified to simply set @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , we have performed simulations with both closures and observed no differences ( not reported in this paper ) .",
    "finally , we point out that in alternative to a hyper - collision operator one may use a spectral filter ( in @xmath42-space ) , such as the one of hou and li  @xcite , as proposed by parker and dellar  @xcite ( see also   for a discussion of this filter in fourier space ) .",
    "in the absence of collisions , conserve a quadratic invariant usually referred to as free energy  @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be defined as @xmath93 , where  @xcite w_fluid=_k @xmath94(1-_0 ) + is the `` fluid '' ( electromagnetic ) part of the free energy , and h_e = d^3v is the electron free energy ( i.e. , the free energy associated with the reduced electron distribution function @xmath20 ) .    upon introducing the hermite expansion of @xmath20 , , and allowing for finite collisions ( modelled by the lenard - bernstein collision operator )",
    ", one finds that @xmath95 evolves according to the following equation  @xcite : [ eq : energy ] w_fluid + _",
    "m=2^g_m^2 = -n_0et_0e_ei_m=3^m g_m^2 -j_^2 .",
    "the above equation is exact .",
    "however , as discussed in , the numerical implementation of the hermite expansion requires that only a finite number of hermite polynomials are kept , and some form of closure to the expansion is required .",
    "if we adopt the closure described by , and truncate the expansion at @xmath75 , adopts the truncated form : [ eq : trunc_energy ] & & w_fluid + _",
    "m=2^mg_m^2 = + & & -n_0et_0e_ei_m=3^m m g_m^2 -n_0et_0e_e @xmath77 ^ 2 -j_^2 , + where the second term on the rhs is due to the specific closure that we have used ( and would vanish if , for example , we instead use the simpler closure @xmath72 . )",
    "the same arguments that were invoked to motivate the hermite closure in apply here to justify the asymptotic equivalence of the full form of the energy balance , and its truncated version ,  that is , as long as @xmath70 is as large as required for @xmath76 to lie in the collisional ( i.e. , @xmath42- ) dissipation range , one expects the terms neglected in going from to to be exponentially small .",
    "the corresponding equation for krmhd is equation ( 4.7 ) of ref .",
    "the closure that we propose in   can be implemented in this set of equations in a similar way , and it is straightforward to obtain the krmhd counterpart of .",
    "the normalizations that we adopt for the krehm set of equations ( [ eq : mom],[eq : ohm],[eq : gk_poisson],[eq : gms ] ) are :    * _ length scales : _ ( x , y)= ( x , y)/;z = z/ , where @xmath96 are , respectively , the perpendicular and parallel ( to the guide - field ) reference length - scales . *",

    "allows for both godunov  @xcite or strang splitting  @xcite .",

    "has inbuilt two distinct methods for the integration of the equations in the direction along the guide - field , @xmath114 : a maccormack scheme  @xcite , and a combination of a third - order total variation diminishing ( tvd ) runge kutta method for the time derivative  @xcite with a seventh - order upwind discretization for the fluxes  @xcite ( tvdrk3uw7 for short ) .",
    "the maccormack scheme is fairly standard ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for textbook presentations ) and there is no need to detail it here .",
    "the tvdrk3uw7 is not as conventional and is described below .",
    "the @xmath114-advection step consists in solving the following set of equations : [ z_system ] = a , where = ( n_e , , g_2 , ... , g_m)^t is the solution vector and @xmath129 is tridiagonal matrix of size @xmath130 whose only non - zero entries are the coefficients of the @xmath114-derivatives , as follows : & & a_k , k+1 = \\{^2 , ^2 , - , , - , } , + & & k=1 , , m , + & & a_k , k-1 = \\{@xmath131 , ^2 , - , , - , } , + & & k=2 , , m.    to be able to use upwind schemes , we need to write in characteristics form , i.e. , we need to diagonalize @xmath129 . to do so",
    ", we introduce the matrix @xmath132 such that becomes p^-1 = p^-1 a p p^-1 .",
    "we define @xmath133 and solve for @xmath132 requiring that p^-1ap = d , where @xmath134 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "the equation for @xmath135 is now in characteristics form : [ z_charact ] = d , namely , if @xmath136 , @xmath137 is a right propagating wave field , and vice - versa . finally , since the entries of @xmath129 are independent of @xmath114 , so are the entries of @xmath134 .",
    "can thus be written in flux - conservative form : [ z_fluxform ] = , where @xmath138 .    as is well known from standard linear algebra , the diagonal entries of the matrix @xmath134 are the eigenvalues of @xmath129 , whereas @xmath132 is the matrix whose column vectors are the eigenvectors of @xmath129 . in , both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath129 are easily obtained with the linear algebra package lapack  @xcite .    as an example , let us consider the simplest possible case : the reduced - mhd limit .",
    "matrix @xmath129 becomes : a=    0 & ^2 + & 0    .",
    "it is a trivial exercise to obtain the matrices @xmath132 , @xmath139 and @xmath134 .",
    "they are : p=    -^2 & ^2 + 1 & 1    , p^-1=    - & + &    , d=    -1 & 0 + 0 & 1    .    in this case , the characteristic fields are = p^-1*u*=(- , + ) ^t . to relate this to a more familiar case , note that , using in the @xmath140 limit to express the electron density perturbation in terms of the electrostatic potential , @xmath141 , we immediately recognize the commonly used elsasser potentials : w^ = ( ) .",
    "note that the entries of @xmath129 are constants , independent of either time or space .",
    "thus , the matrices @xmath132 , @xmath139 and @xmath134 need only to be calculated once per run , with negligible impact on the overall code performance .",
    "the derivative of the flux @xmath142 is computed using a seventh - order upwind scheme  @xcite : @xmath143_i= , where , for the @xmath144th component of @xmath142 , we have [ flux1 ] f_i+1/2^j =- f_i+4^j+f_i+3^j - f_i+2^j + f_i+1^j + + f_i^j - f_i-1^j+f_i-2^j , d_j>0 , [ flux2 ] f_i+1/2^j =- f_i-3^j+f_i-2^j - f_i-1^j + f_i^j + + f_i+1^j - f_i+2^j+f_i+3^j , d_j<0 .      for the time integration of we follow  @xcite .",
    "the time derivative is discretized using an optimal third - order total variation diminishing ( tvd ) runge kutta method  @xcite : [ tvdrk ] & & * w*^(1 ) = * w*^(n ) + , + & & * w*^(2 ) = ^(n ) + ^(1 ) + , + & & * w*^(n+1 ) = ^(n ) + ^(2 ) + .",
    "the final step is to compute @xmath145 .",
    "compared to the maccormack method , the tvdrk3uw7 scheme just described has the disadvantage of being somewhat slower , as it requires three evaluations of the right hand side ( as opposed to only two for maccormack ) and there are more communications involved between different processors to compute the fluxes , .",
    "this is partially offset by the fact that the tvdrk3uw7 scheme requires much fewer grid points per wavelength than the maccormack method for an adequate resolution , as will be exemplified in .",
    "expanding the @xmath146 operator in the closure term in , we find that it becomes : [ eq : gm ] & & = -v_theg_m-1 + & & + _ e \\{-@xmath147-@xmath148 + @xmath149 } + & & -_eim g_m .",
    "as we have discussed in previous sections , the numerical algorithm employed in  uses operator splitting methods to deal separately with the @xmath114-derivatives and with the poisson brackets ( i.e. , it splits the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic guide - field ) .",
    "this raises a difficulty when discretising the equation above , which contains mixed terms ( the second and third terms inside the curly brackets ) introduced by the closure , ; this is an especially subtle issue when the @xmath114-step scheme advects the equations in characteristics form , as is the case of the tvdrk3uw7 that we employ ( and would equally be the case for any other upwind scheme ) .",
    "simple solutions to this problem require abandoning the operator splitting scheme and forsaking the use of the characteristics form for the @xmath114-derivative terms of the equations , both of which are not only highly convenient from the point of view of numerical accuracy and stability , but also physically motivated .",
    "one possibility would be to treat this equation differently from all other equations solved by the code .",
    "although this is certainly possible , at this stage we have chosen not to introduce this additional complexity .",
    "as such , the actual form of implemented in  is [ eq : gm_closed ] & = & -v_theg_m-1 + _ e \\ { + @xmath149 } + & & -_eim g_m .",
    "we emphasize that the dropping of the mixed terms is purely for algorithmic reasons . from the physical point of view",
    "those terms are , _ a priori _ , as important as the closure terms which are kept ; their implementation is thus left to future work .",
    "a serious drawback of this approach , for example , is that the semi - collisional limit of the krehm equations ( which results from setting @xmath150 , see section v.c of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is , therefore , not correctly captured .    on the other hand ,",
    "note that : ( i ) for 2d problems , our implementation of the closure is exact ; ( ii ) for simple linear 3d problems [ where the background magnetic field is simply given by that guide - field ( which is the setup used to investigate alfvn wave propagation in ) , the numerical implementation of the closure is also exact ; ( iii ) in weakly collisional plasmas ( which are our main focus ) , provided that @xmath70 is sufficiently large to lie in the collisional dissipation range , one expects @xmath151 and thus the actual functional form of the closure may not be very important ; ( iv ) if we first apply the operator splitting scheme ( i.e. , the separation of the perpendicular and parallel operators ) and then impose our closure scheme on the parallel and perpendicular equations separately , we would obtain instead of .",
    "finally , we remark that adopting as the evolution equation for @xmath76 changes the second term on the rhs of the energy balance equation , ( [ eq : trunc_energy ] ) , in the obvious way .",
    "in this section , we report an extensive suite of linear and nonlinear benchmarks of .      to illustrate the relative merits of the two numerical schemes for the @xmath114-advection available in , we carry out a simple test in the limit of isothermal electrons and cold ions . and reduce to [ iso_cold_ne ] & = & ^2 , + [ iso_cold_apar ] & = & .",

    "notice , for example , that for the extreme case of @xmath166 , tvdrk3uw7 yields an amount of energy loss after 10 crossing times of @xmath167 , very similar to what is obtained with the maccormack scheme for the ten times better resolved case of @xmath168 .",

    "we look at strong scaling , keeping the problem size fixed and varying the number of mpi processes , mainly in the parallel direction .",
    "this produces a supralinear scaling , which breaks down after @xmath255 cores for the @xmath256 case and at @xmath257 cores for the @xmath258 one .",
    "similar results have been obtained on other clusters , such as stampede ( a mixed intel xeon e5 and intel xeon phi coprocessor cluster ) , hopper ( a cray xe6 ) and edison ( a cray xc30 .",

    "this paper describes , a novel code developed to investigate strongly magnetised , weakly - collisional , fluid - kinetic plasma dynamics in ( 2d or 3d ) slab geometry .  solves two different sets of equations : the kinetic reduced electron heating model ( krehm ) of zocco & schekochihin  @xcite ( which simplifies to conventional reduced - mhd  @xcite in the appropriate limit ) and the kinetic reduced mhd ( krmhd ) equations of schekochihin  @xcite .",
    "the main numerical methods and the overall algorithm are described .",
    "a noteworthy feature of  is its spectral representation of velocity - space , achieved via a hermite expansion of the distribution function , as proposed in  @xcite for krehm and in  @xcite for the krmhd equations .",
    "this representation has the attractive property of converting the kinetic equation for the distribution function into a coupled set of fluid - like equations for each hermite polynomial coefficient  the advantage being that such equations are numerically more convenient to solve than the kinetic equation where they stem from . on the other hand ,",
    "the hermite expansion introduces a closure problem ( in the sense that the equation for the hermite coefficient of order @xmath42 couples to that of order @xmath259 ) . to address this problem",
    ", we present a nonlinear , asymptotically rigorous closure whose validity requires only that collisions are finite , but otherwise as small as required .",
    "naturally , the smaller the collision frequency the higher the number of hermite moments that need to be kept to guarantee the accuracy of the closure .",
    "realistic values of the collision frequency in the systems that are of primary interest to us ( e.g. , modern fusion devices , space and astrophysical environments ) lead to impractically large number of moments .",
    "the adoption of a hyper - collision operator ( the direct translation into hermite space of the usual hyper - diffusion operators used in ( fourier ) @xmath48-space ) allows us to deal with this problem .",
    "together with a pseudo - spectral representation of the plane perpendicular to the background magnetic field , and the option of a spectral - like algorithm for the dynamics along the field , the hermite representation of velocity space implies that  is ideally suited to the investigation of magnetised kinetic plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection , with the unique capability of allowing for the direct monitoring of energy flows in phase - space  @xcite .",
    "a series of linear and nonlinear numerical tests of  is presented , with emphasis on orszag - tang - type decaying turbulence , both in the fluid and kinetic limits , where it is shown that  recovers the theoretically expected power - law spectra . in this context ,",
    "an interesting , novel result that warrants further investigation and will be discussed in a separate publication is the @xmath260 velocity - space ( hermite ) spectrum that is obtained in the 3d kinetic ( sub - ion larmor radius scales ) orszag - tang run presented in   ( see  ) .",
    "this particular form of the hermite spectrum is indicative of linear phase mixing  @xcite and suggests that this ( and ensuing landau damping ) may be a key energy transfer mechanism in kinetic decaying turbulence .",
    "the authors are greatly indebted to alex schekochihin for many discussions and ideas that have been fundamental to this work .",
    "nfl thanks paul dellar for pointing out the high - order fourier smoothing method of ref .",
    "@xcite , ravi samtaney for discussions on high - order integration schemes for advection - type partial differential equations , and ryusuke numata for providing the data obtained with astrogk that appears in of this paper .",
