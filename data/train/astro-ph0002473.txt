    "the data were obtained at a photometric phase of @xmath12 . from the data the total intensity ( figs .",
    "[ polmap]a and b ) , the polarized intensity ( fig .  [ polmap]c ) , the degree and position angle of the polarization ( fig .",

    "the bipolar shape of this nebula is most prominently present in the @xmath0band image ( fig .",
    "[ rech]c ) and in the hst images at shorter wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ polmap]a ) .",
    "however , the fact that even in the polarized intensity the nebula is very faint on the southeastern side suggests the main axis of the nebula to be at pa@xmath13 to @xmath14 along the direction from component a to b. this fits well to the main axis of the h@xmath15cn(@xmath16 ) emission ( dayal & bieging 1995 ) which is weakly elongated on a scale of about 10@xmath17 .",
    "we determined the separations of the components a and b for the 5 epochs from 1995 to 1998 shown in fig .",
    "[ recall ] .",
    "the separations are : 191  mas , 201  mas , 214  mas , 245  mas , and 265  mas .",
    "a linear regression fit gives a value of 23  mas / yr for the average increase in the apparent separation of the components .",
    "interpreting this increase as a real motion would lead to 14  km / s within the plane of the sky ( for a distance of @xmath18  pc ) .",
    "the result comprises data from more than one pulsation period ( @xmath10649  days , see le  bertre 1992 ) and it is thus obvious that the apparent relative motion of the nebula components is not simply related to the stellar variability .    besides the motion of the components , fig .",
    "[ recall ] shows that these components change their shapes and relative fluxes .",
    "the brightest component a becomes narrower along the axis a  b ( @xmath1020@xmath11 ) .",
    "the peak  to  peak intensity ratio of b and a is almost constant from 1995 to 1997 .",
    "later component b is fading . at the same time",
    "the other components become brighter and detached from a. note that the photometric phases and the integral @xmath2 magnitudes of irc+10216 in january 1997 and november 1998 are almost identical ( osterbart et  al.1999 ) . again",
    "we find that the time scale for the changes seen in our images is significantly different from the period of the stellar pulsation .",
    "in the following we want to address the question where , behind all the dust , the central star in the system of irc+10216 is located . this question is of specific interest to understand the physical properties of the nebula . at short wavelengths",
    "the nebula shows a bipolar structure .",
    "a comparison of the observed structure to other bipolar nebulae like the red rectangle ( menshchikov et  al .  1998 ) suggests that the x  like arms originate mainly from scattering of stellar light on the surfaces of cavities .",
    "the star then is at least partially obscured by an optically thick dust shell or torus .",
    "convincingly haniff & buscher @xcite argued that the main axis of the object is tilted with its southern side towards the observer .",
    "_ is component a the star ?",
    "_ at first glance it seems reasonable to assume that the star is at the position of the brightest component a. however , the synthetic polarization maps of fischer et  al .  @xcite show that a significant polarization at the position of the star is only present for nearly edge  on configurations .",
    "the high degree of polarization of a ( @xmath19 ) is thus not in agreement with a being the star because the structure of the bipolar nebula at short wavelengths suggests that we are looking at an intermediate viewing angle ( e.g.  50@xmath11 to 60@xmath11 ) . at larger separations from a the polarization pattern",
    "is centrosymmetric .",
    "the center of such a pattern is thought to be at the position of the illuminating source ( fischer et  al .",
    "1996 ) . since in the map in fig .",
    "[ polmap]b this center does not coincide with a , but is located significantly north of a , we are led to the conclusion that a is not the star .    _ is the star at the position of b ? _ in the following we will show that it is consistent with the observation to assume that the star is at the position of b.    \\(a ) the cometary shapes of a ( fig .",
    "[ rech ] ) as well as the presented polarization data strongly suggest that a is part of a scattering lobe within a bipolar structure .",
    "consistently , component a and its southern tails are relatively blue ( @xmath20 in the range from 2 to 3.2 ; see osterbart et  al .",
    "1999 ) compared to the integral color ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "\\(b ) the northern components b , c , and d are , on the other hand , rather red ( @xmath22 ) in comparison with the integral color .",
    "this suggests that these structures are strongly obscured and reddened by circumstellar dust .",
    "\\(c ) the brightest northern component in the @xmath0 image ( fig .",
    "[ rech]c ) can hardly be seen in the @xmath1 image and is thus very blue .",
    "this component and a can be considered as opposite lobes of an almost bipolar structure .",
    "component b is almost in the center between these counterlobes and thus approx .  at the position where",
    "the star would be expected .",
    "\\(d ) the polarization map ( fig .  [ polmap]b ) fits well to the picture that the star is at b. the center of the centrosymmetric polarization pattern at larger separations from a is located between the two @xmath0band lobes .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that the illuminating source is at or near the postion of b ( cf .",
    "fischer et  al.1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the polarization at the position of b itself is contaminated by contributions from the diffraction pattern associated with the peak a.    _ changes in the mass loss rate . _",
    "the change of the shape of component a and the fading of b can be attributed to an increasing mass loss which is accompanied by a gradual increase of the optical depth of the dust shell .",
    "this is most obvious for the later observation epochs , suggesting an enhanced mass loss since 1997 .",
    "a strongly variable mass loss has , in fact , been predicted by theoretical models treating the dust formation mechanism in the envelopes of long  period variable carbon stars ( winters et  al .",
    ". periods of this mechanism may be significantly longer than the stellar pulsation period . _",
    "alternative models : the star between a and b or near b. _ it is not possible to exclude that the star may be located between a and b , close to b , or in the center of a , b , c , and d. the precision of the polarization map is not sufficient to conclude whether the star is at the position of b or only close to it .",
    "two  dimensional radiative transfer calculations in progess show , however , that the observed intensity ratio of a and b as well as the components shapes clearly require the star to be at b.",
    "irc+10216 is without doubt in a very advanced stage of its agb evolution due to its long pulsational period , high mass - loss rate , and carbon - rich dust - shell chemistry indicating that already a significant number of thermal pulses did take place . the star s initial mass",
    "can be estimated to be @xmath23m@xmath24m@xmath25 due to the observed isotopic ratios of c , n and o in the dust shell ( guelin et  al.1995 ) and the luminosity of the central star ( weigelt et  al .",
    "accordingly , the core mass should be @xmath26 to @xmath27m@xmath25 with corresponding thermal - pulse cycle times of @xmath28yr ( blcker 1995 ) . introducing",
    "the mean observed mass - loss rate to these thermal - pulse periods shows that the present stellar wind leads to a very effective erosion of the envelope per thermal pulse cycle , possibly as high as @xmath29m@xmath25/cycle .",
    "consequently , the whole envelope may be lost during the next few thermal pulses leading to the termination of the agb evolution .",
    "thus , it is not unlikely to assume that irc+10216 has entered a phase immediately before moving off the agb .",
    "this is strongly supported by the non - spherical appearence of its dust shell showing even bipolar structures . unlike agb stars , post - agb objects as protoplanetary nebulae",
    "often expose prominent features of asphericities , in particular in axisymmetric geometry ( e.g.  olofsson 1996 ) .",
    "accordingly , irc+10216 can be thought to be an object in transition .",
    "it is noteworthy that the establishment of bipolar structures , i.e. the metamorphosis into a protoplanetary nebulae , obviously already begins during the ( very end of ) agb evolution .",
    "the clumpiness within the bipolar shape is probably due to small scale fluctuations of the dust condensation radius which , in turn , might be influenced by , e.g. , giant surface convection cells ( schwarzschild 1975 ) .",
    "the formation of giant convection cells can be assumed to be a common phenomenon in red giants .",
    "the shaping of planetary nebulae can successfully be described by interacting stellar wind models ( kwok et al .",
    "1978 ) within this scenario a fast ( spherical ) wind from the central star interacts with the slow wind of the preceding agb evolution .",
    "the slow agb wind is asssumed to be non - spherical ( axisymmetric ) which leads to the observed morphology of planetary nebulae ( mellema 1996 ) .",
    "different mechanisms to provide the required equatorial density enhancements are discussed ( cf .",
    "livio 1993 ) . among these , binarity is one channel including common envelope evolution and spin up of the agb star due to the interaction with its companion ( morris 1981 ) .",
    "not only stellar companions are found to be able to spin up the agb star but also substellar ones as brown dwarfs and planets , most effectively by evaporation in the agb star s envelope ( soker 1997 ) .",
    "currently there is no observational evidence for a possible binary nature of irc+10216 .",
    "the fact that the polarization pattern in the southeastern part of the nebula at 1.1  @xmath9 m has a different orientation than in the rest of the nebula might be an indication for a second illuminating source .",
    "mechanisms inherent to the star include rotation , non - radial pulsations , and magnetic fields ( see e.g.  dorfi & hfner 1996 , soker & harpaz 1992 , garcia - segura et al .  1999 ) . both non - radial @xmath30-modes and magnetic fields appear to be only important for significant rotation rates .",
    "often spin - up agents due to binarity are assumed .",
    "for instance , groenewegen @xcite favours non - radial pulsation or a yet unidentified companion which spun up the central star as the most likely explanation for the non - spherical shape of the dust shell of irc+10216 .",
    "agb stars are known to be slow rotators .",
    "stars with initial masses below @xmath31m@xmath25 can be expected to lose almost their entire angular momentum during the main sequence phase due to magnetic braking operating in their convective envelopes .",
    "consequently they are not believed to develop non - spherical mass - loss due to rotation .",
    "stars with larger initial masses are spun down due to mass loss but may achieve sufficiently high rotation rates at the end of agb evolution ( garcia - segura et al .",
    "already small rotation rates influence dust - driven winds considerably yielding a mass loss preferentially driven in the equatorial plane ( dorfi & hfner 1996 ) . for supergiants leaving the hayashi line heger &",
    "langer @xcite found that significant spin up of the surface layers may take place .",
    "thus , at second glance , rotation might be able to support axisymmetric mass loss during the transition to the proto - planetary nebula phase for agb stars as irc+10216 .",
    "we have presented high - resolution @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2band observations of irc+10216 with the highest resolution so far at @xmath1 of 70  mas .",
    "a series of @xmath2band images from five epochs between october 1995 and november 1998 shows that the inner nebula is non - stationary .",
    "the separations of the four dominant resolved components increased within the 3 years by almost @xmath32 .",
    "for the two brightest components a relative velocity within the plane of the sky of about 23  mas / yr or 14  km / s was found . within these 3 years the rather faint components c and d",
    "become brighter whereas component b is fading .",
    "the general geometry of the nebula seems to be bipolar .",
    "we find that the most promising model to explain the structures and changes in the inner nebula is to assume that the star is at the position of component b. the star then is strongly but not totally obscured at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "consistently component b is very red in the @xmath20 color while a and the northern @xmath0band components are relatively blue . similarly the polarization pattern with strong polarization in the northern arms and still a significant polarization in the peak supports this model .",
    "the inner nebula and the apparent motions seem to be rather symmetric around this position and the observed changes are consistent with an enhanced mass loss since 1997 .",
    "irc+10216 is without doubt in a very advanced stage of its agb evolution .",
    "the observed bipolarity of its dust shell even reveals that it has possibly entered the phase of transformation into a protoplanetary nebula .",
