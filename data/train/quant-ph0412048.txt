    "a number of physical systems that are considered for the realization of a universal quantum computer , such as optical lattices @xcite or arrays of micro - lenses @xcite , possess a translation symmetry in the arrangement of qubits and their mutual interaction .",
    "quantum cellular automata ( qca ) represent a suitable framework to explore the computational power of such physical systems , because they respect this symmetry . a priori",
    ", translation invariance may be regarded as a severe limitation since it constrains the degree of control that can be exerted to the quantum system .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that one - dimensional qca can efficiently simulate any quantum turing machine @xcite .",
    "further it has been shown that there exists a universal qca which can simulate any other automaton with linear slowdown @xcite , and that every reversible qca can be represented in a generalized margolus partitioning scheme @xcite .",
    "proposals with an emphasis on experimental viability have outlined how generic physical systems can be used as quantum computation devices if equipped with a minimal amount of external control . among the described mechanisms are global control via sequences of resonant light pulses @xcite or modulation of a coupling constant @xcite , and individual control over one of the elementary cells @xcite .    at this point",
    ", one may abandon all algorithm - specific control during the process of computation and ask `` how intricate do quantum cellular automata have to be such that they can perform useful tasks in quantum information processing ? '' .",
    "a quick answer may be  simple , by definition .",
    " however , when qcas are tuned for algorithmic application , it may occur that  while the simple composition is retained  the elementary cells and neighborhood schemes become complicated .",
    "an interesting facet of the answer to the above question has been provided in @xcite , where a very simple qca for quantum data transmission has been devised ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by a recent result @xcite , where universal computation via autonomous evolution of a 10-local hamiltonian is described , here i consider quantum computation in the cellular automaton scenario .",
    "i explicitly construct a computationally universal two - dimensional qca whose transition rule is based on a four - qubit unitary .",
    "consider a two dimensional lattice of size @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. a torus .",
    "each lattice site carries a qubit .",
    "the transition rule for the qca is described in terms of a margolus partitioning @xcite .",
    "the lattice is partitioned into cells of size @xmath0 , and there is a separate partitioning for the time @xmath2 being even or odd , respectively .",
    "one may choose a coordinate system on the torus with axes parallel to what were the boundaries before identification .",
    "for @xmath2 even , the qubits in the upper left corner of each cell have both coordinates even , and for @xmath2 odd they have both coordinates odd .",
    "thus , a cell in step @xmath2 overlaps with four cells of step @xmath3 .    the transition of the qca from time @xmath2 to @xmath4 proceeds by simultaneously applying a unitary transition function @xmath5 to each cell . for",
    "a suitable choice of the 4-qubit unitary @xmath5 one can perform universal quantum computation with the described qca .",
    "specifically , a quantum logic network of local and next - neighbor unitary gates with width @xmath6 and depth @xmath7 can be simulated .    with a labeling of particles as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cells]a , the following elementary transition function is chosen : @xmath8 therein , @xmath9 denotes a swap - gate between qubit @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a hadamard transformation on qubit @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes a pauli phase flip operator applied to qubit @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 is a state in the computational basis , it effectively stores two classical bits , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then , the transition function @xmath5 amounts to a classically controlled unitary operation @xmath19 applied to @xmath20 .",
    "the bit @xmath18 triggers a @xmath21 gate applied to @xmath20 , and @xmath17 a @xmath22-phase gate @xmath23 applied to qubit 1 of @xmath20 . in this way , @xmath24 encodes an elementary step of a program , carried out on the two - qubit `` data '' @xmath20 .",
    "the swap - gates allow the quantum data and the program to pass by another , such that @xmath20 can interact with subsequent program registers .",
    "the sets of qubits on the torus with the same first coordinate @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are called columns . at time @xmath27 all even columns contain data registers @xmath28 , and all odd columns contain program registers @xmath29 .",
    "the initial state of the automaton is @xmath30 here and in the following the labels inside the kets specify the state and the ones outside specify the location of the support within the lattice i.e. , the column .",
    "for example , @xmath31 is data register no . 1 at time @xmath27 , located on column 2 .",
    "of all data registers only @xmath32 is used , the others are auxiliary .",
    "when the qca starts to run , the data registers move right ( counter - clockwise , as seen from top ) and the program registers move left ( clockwise ) , by one column in each time step .",
    "when passing the data registers , the program registers @xmath24 control unitary transformations @xmath19 acting upon the data registers @xmath33 . in this way , a program specified by the data @xmath34 , with @xmath35 encoding the first and @xmath36 the last step ,",
    "is carried out on the quantum data register @xmath32 .",
    "the program that is carried out corresponds to a quantum logic network of local and next - neighbor gates in a particular arrangement ; see fig .",
    "such networks are sufficient for universal quantum computation , as is discussed in detail further below . the same program steps that are applied to the register @xmath32 are also carried out on the auxiliary data registers @xmath28 , @xmath37 , but in scrambled order .",
    "therefore , these registers are not used .",
    "in course of computation , both data and program travel across half the torus .",
    "when the automaton has run for @xmath7 time steps , the computation is finished and the register @xmath38 can be read out from column @xmath7 , via local measurements .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the elementary transition function ( [ elem ] ) applied to the cell @xmath40 .",
    "therein , @xmath41 is the column coordinate of the upper left qubit in the cell , and @xmath42 the respective coordinate within the column .",

    "the global transition function @xmath50 is , for even @xmath2 given by @xmath51 , and for odd @xmath2 by @xmath52 . in both cases",

    "let us recover therein some features of the qca that were stated before .",
    "it is easy to see that ",
    "apart from being moved  the program registers remain unchanged throughout the evolution , and that there is no entanglement across columns .",

    "the third line follows by ( [ dit ] ) and , for the @xmath24-part , the substitution @xmath70 under which the product is invariant .",
    "@xmath71    finally , it is shown that the quantum logic network simulated by the described qca is indeed universal , as stated .",
    "the cnot- , the hadamard- and the @xmath22-phase gate @xmath72 form a universal gate set @xcite . for the described qca",
    ", one can independently apply the hadamard- , the @xmath22-phase gate and the identity to the simulated logical qubits , by choosing the following sequences of @xmath17-bits @xmath73 .",

    "a next - neighbor cnot - gate that acts within this cycle can be constructed from a @xmath21- and two hadamard - gates .",
    "the long - distance cnot - gates may then be constructed with the help of next - neighbor swap - gates , which themselves consist of three next - neighbor cnot - gates .",
    "this completes our construction of a qca capable of performing universal quantum computation .",
    "two remarks : 1 ) the described qca may , with some right , be called a deterministic programmable quantum gate array , but this notion is already in use for a construction that has been proven not to exist @xcite . our qca is consistent with this result .",
    "the program information is classical and all program states @xmath74 are orthogonal , as required in @xcite .",
    "further , from the viewpoint of temporal complexity , the described qca is  within a constant  as efficient as a quantum logic network with local and next - neighbor gates .",
    "\\2 ) that the described qca lives on a torus simplifies the discussion , but is not essential .",
    "a planar sheet of size @xmath75 is sufficient for simulation of the discussed networks of @xmath7 time steps and @xmath76 qubits .",
    "[ boundary ] specifies the operations on the boundary that differ from @xmath5 .",
    "when this modified qca is run , in the bulk the data registers still move right and the program registers left . on the left and right boundary ,",
    "however , the registers are reflected . as a consequence ,",
    "on the left side of the lattice , reflected program registers are acted upon by left - moving program registers as if they were data .",
    "more severely , on the right side of the cluster , reflected data registers act upon right - moving data registers as program .",
    "therefore , the state of the qca is no longer a tensor product of the column states , but instead an entangled state supported by many columns grows from the right , by one column in each time step .",
    "however , none of that has an impact on the data register @xmath32 , which  as before  can be read out from column @xmath7 after @xmath7 transitions of the automaton .",
    "i have described a quantum cellular automaton for universal quantum computation . the transition function from one time - step to the next is generated by a four - qubit unitary transformation acting on margolus cells of size @xmath0 .",
    "the program is encoded in the initial state of the system , and the automaton is left to its autonomous evolution from initialization to readout ."
