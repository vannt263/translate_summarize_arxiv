    "few- and many - body systems at low energy with resonant short - range interactions are remarkable for their universal nature . in these systems ,",
    "most of the details of the interaction potentials are unimportant except for a few parameters , which fully characterize the interaction between the particles . in many cases , these parameters reduce to a single one , the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 , and all the physical properties are expressed in terms of the scattering length @xmath1 . for example , the binding energy of two particles scales as @xmath2 , and the scattering properties between these dimers and other particles or other dimers can also be universally expressed in terms of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath0-wave scattering length becomes infinite , at some resonance point , one reaches the so - called unitarity regime , where the system has no intrinsic length scale and becomes completely universal @xcite .    in some other cases ,",
    "however , extra parameters are needed .",
    "this is the case of three - body systems where the efimov effect occurs @xcite .",
    "the efimov effect is characterized by the appearance of an infinite series of trimer bound states at unitarity .",
    "this effect results from the effective 3-body attraction between particles interacting through resonant short - range interactions . when this attraction is strong enough to overcome the repulsion that arises either from the centrifugal barrier due to rotation or from the pauli exclusion principle of identical fermions , the particles can bind to form trimers called efimov trimers . because the particles are attracted to short distances ,",
    "an extra short - range parameter is needed to completely determine their wave function .",
    "thus , trimer binding energies and scattering properties in such systems depend on both the scattering length and the extra parameter .",
    "efimov trimers are associated with remarkable features such as discrete scale invariance of their spectrum , and have attracted a lot of interest since their recent experimental realizations with ultracold atoms @xcite .    in general , the strength of the efimov attraction depends on the mass ratios between particles .",
    "for example , in the case of two identical fermions and one different particle , which is resonantly interacting with the two fermions , the efimov attraction is too weak for the efimov effect to occur if the particles have the same masses .",
    "however , when the mass ratio between one of the two fermions and the third particle becomes larger than the critical value 13.6 , and the system has one unit of total angular momentum , the efimov attraction becomes dominant , and can support bound states , i.e. trimers formed of two fermions and one particle .",
    "recently , kartavtsev and malykh found that trimers also exist for mass ratios smaller than the critical value @xcite .",
    "indeed , even though in this regime the centrifugal repulsion dominates at short distance , its combined effect with the weak efimov attraction creates a shallow potential well that can support these trimers .",
    "although these trimers are related to the efimov physics , their nature differs from that of efimov trimers .",
    "first , they do not exhibit the discrete scale invariance of the efimov trimer spectrum , and appear only for positive scattering lengths .",
    "second , they are universal states in the sense that they can be characterized only by the scattering length , unlike efimov states which also depend on short - range physics . for the universal trimers ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier at short distance prevents the particles from coming close to each other , so that the three - body recombination occurring at a short distance is also suppressed .",
    "thus , these universal trimer states are much longer - lived than the efimov trimers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the general problem of the particle - dimer scattering in the zero - range limit , where two of the particles are identical ( bosonic or fermionic ) particles and a third particle is of a different kind . in particular , we look for the resonances in the particle - dimer scattering due to the formation of the universal trimers . for this purpose",
    ", we derive an integral equation to calculate the particle - dimer scattering lengths in various angular momentum channels .",
    "this equation is a generalization of the skorniakov  ter - martirosian equation . with this integral equation",
    ", we calculate the particle - dimer scattering lengths for various angular momenta.we confirm that the scattering lengths diverge at the mass ratio where the universal trimers were predicted to appear @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , a generalization of the skorniakov  ter - martirosian equation  to an arbitrary - angular momentum is presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we show the results of the calculation of the particle - dimer scattering lengths for various angular momenta , and the binding energy of the universal trimer states . in the appendix",
    ", we give the detailed derivation of the generalized skorniakov  ter - martirosian equation for high angular momenta .",
    "we consider a system of two identical particles ( bosons or fermions ) strongly interacting with a third particle of a different kind .",
    "we assume that this interaction is nearly resonant , and thus characterized by an @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 , which is much larger than the range of the interaction . on the other hand , we assume that the interaction between the identical particles is not resonant , and therefore can be neglected .",
    "this is even more justified for identical fermions , which do not interact in the @xmath0-wave channel . as a result , there is only one length scale in the problem , given by @xmath1 , which we take as the unit length : @xmath3 .",
    "this three - body problem can be solved by an integral - equation approach .",
    "the @xmath0-wave scattering length between the particle and the dimer , in which one of the particles is identical with the unbound one , can be obtained by solving the integral equation derived by skorniakov and ter - martirosian @xcite , and found to be @xmath4 in the equal - mass case .",
    "recently , the calculation was also extended to the unequal - mass case @xcite . here , we derive a similar integral equation to calculate the scattering lengths and the binding energy for arbitrary angular momenta .    the quantity characterizing the particle - dimer scattering in the @xmath5-th wave angular momentum channel is the @xmath5-th wave scattering lengths @xmath6 , which are defined as a low - energy contribution of the @xmath5-th wave phase shift @xmath7 @xmath8 since the phase shift @xmath7 is related with the @xmath5-th wave angular momentum component of the particle - dimer scattering amplitude @xmath9 as @xmath10 @xmath6 represents the low - energy scattering property @xcite .",
    "the partial wave scattering length @xmath6 can be calculated from the following integral equation , whose derivation is given in the appendix : @xmath11^{l+1}\\\\ = & \\pm a_l(p_1 ) + \\frac{(-1)^{l+1}}{\\pi}\\frac{(\\alpha+1)}{\\alpha}\\int_{0}^{\\infty } dq \\frac{q^{l+1}}{p_1^{l+1}}q_l\\biggr(\\frac{\\frac{\\alpha+1}{{2\\alpha}}[-\\epsilon + p_1 ^ 2+q^2]}{p_1q}\\biggl)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-\\epsilon+\\frac{2\\alpha+1}{(\\alpha+1)^2}q^2}-1}a_l(q ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 refers to bosons ( + ) and fermions ( - ) , @xmath13 is the mass ratio between one of the two identical particles and the third particle , @xmath14 is the total energy in units of the dimer s binding energy , @xmath15 denotes the legendre function of the second kind , and @xmath16 is the @xmath5-th wave momentum - dependent scattering length whose value at @xmath17 corresponds to the @xmath5-th wave scattering length @xmath6 . by solving this integral equation at the dimer - particle continuum threshold @xmath18 , we obtain the @xmath5-th wave scattering length . on the other hand",
    ", we can find the binding energy of the trimer states by searching for the value of @xmath14 at which @xmath6 diverges .",
    "this can be done by finding the value of @xmath14 at which the eigenvalue of the right - hand side ( seen as an operator acting on @xmath16 ) vanishes .",
    "we note that in the numerical calculation , we take a finite momentum cutoff instead of the infinite upper boundary of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] ) . for a mass ratio smaller than the efimov threshold listed in table [ tab : result_list ] ,",
    "we obtain convergent results if we take a sufficiently large momentum cutoff .",
    "however , if the mass ratio gets closer to the efimov threshold , the cutoff required for the convergence to the universal results becomes larger and larger . above the efimov threshold ,",
    "the results depend on the cutoff , as it plays the role of the short - range parameter needed to characterize efimov physics @xcite .",

    ", the results should not depend on the momentum cutoff in the integration if we take it as sufficiently large .",
    "this is illustrated in the figures by a set of curves corresponding to different momentum cutoffs .",
    "below the efimov threshold , these curves essentially superimpose and correspond to the universal curve . above the efimov threshold",

    "the other one corresponds to the universal trimer states , which were shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be related to a universal function of only two parameters .",
    "we note that the widths of the resonances become narrower in the higher angular - momentum channels .",

    ", we have calculated the particle - dimer scattering lengths for various angular - momentum channels , and found resonances due to the formation of universal trimers and efimov trimers .",
    "ultracold atomic gases are currently the most likely candidates for the experimental possibility of observing the universal resonances and bound states . in these systems , a very large @xmath0-wave scattering length can be realized by using a feshbach resonance , providing access to the universal regime where the scattering length is the single parameter characterizing the system @xcite . as for controlling the mass ratio ,",
    "it is possible to prepare hetero - nuclear systems with mass imbalance @xcite , and thus select the appropriate mass ratio from a broad variety of atomic species .",
    "some possible atomic combinations are listed in table [ tab : species ] .",

    "the centrifugal barrier of the universal trimers prevents them from undergoing such recombination processes , and makes them stable @xcite .",
