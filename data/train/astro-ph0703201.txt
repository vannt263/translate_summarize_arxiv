    "despite much effort devoted , the origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in keplerian accretion disks is still poorly understood .",
    "this is essentially important for accretion disks around quiescent cataclysmic variables , proto - planetary and star - forming disks , and the outer regions of disks in active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "a keplerian accretion disk flow having a very low molecular viscosity must generate turbulence and successively diffusive viscosity to support transfer of mass inward . however , theoretically this flow never exhibits any unstable mode . on the other hand ,",
    "laboratory experiments of taylor - couette systems , which are similar to keplerian disks , seem to indicate that although the coriolis force delays the onset of turbulence , the flow is ultimately unstable to turbulence @xcite .",
    "however , some other experiments say against it @xcite .",
    "we believe that not finding hydrodynamic turbulence is due to their choice of large aspect ratio and small reynolds number .",
    "various kinds of secondary instability , such as the elliptical instability , are widely discussed as a possible route to self - sustained turbulence in linearly perturbed shear flows ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these effects have been proposed as a generic mechanism for the breakdown of many two - dimensional high reynolds number flows .",
    "however , such effects have not been discussed properly in literatures for rotating keplerian flows .",
    "therefore , we plan to show that the three - dimensional secondary perturbation can generate large growth in the flow time scale and presumably trigger turbulence in the keplerian disk . unlike the two - dimensional transient growth studied earlier @xcite which were shown to be killed immediately in presence of vertical structure , in the present case we demonstrate essentially three - dimensional growth .",
    "possibility of large growth in shear flows _ with rotation _ by",
    "a three - dimensional perturbation opens a new window to explain hydrodynamic turbulence which has an important implication not only in astrophysics but also in general physics and fluid dynamics .",
    "we consider a small section of the keplerian disk in the shearing box approximation @xcite with the unperturbed velocity @xmath1 .",
    "we also assume that the incompressible flow extends from @xmath2 to @xmath3 with no - slip boundary conditions and is unbounded with periodic boundary condition along @xmath4 and @xmath5 . therefore the linearized navier - stokes equations for a 2d _ primary perturbation _ such that @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and pressure @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 with the equation of continuity @xmath10 , where the angular frequency @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a keplerian disk . when the reynolds number @xmath13 is very large , the solution of above equations is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the amplitude of vorticity perturbation . under this _ primary perturbation _ , the flow velocity and pressure modify to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the position vector and @xmath18 is a tensor of rank @xmath19 .",
    "now we concentrate on a further small patch of the primarily perturbed flow such that @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "then we consider a _",
    "secondary perturbation _ to this flow such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 therefore , we obtain the evolution of a linearized _ secondary perturbation _ @xmath25",
    "we specifically concentrate on the flow having low viscosity . therefore , the general solution @xcite of eqn .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) can be written as a linear superposition of the floquet modes @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a periodic function having time - period @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the floquet exponent which is different at different @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath31 is positive then the system is unstable and plausibly turbulent .",
    "when the secondary perturbation evolves much rapidly than the primary one and @xmath33 , @xmath31 has an analytic solution given by @xmath34 clearly , for a keplerian disk @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , a keplerian flow is hydrodynamically unstable under a vertical secondary perturbation if @xmath36 . for other perturbations",
    "@xmath31 can be computed numerically described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we now plan to quantify this by computing the corresponding turbulent viscosity . for the isotropic disk fluid , the turbulent viscosity @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are local sound speed and disk thickness respectively . on the other hand , shearing stress @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the _ shakura - sunyaev viscosity _ parameter at a disk radius @xmath41 @xmath42 for a disk with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , a vertical secondary perturbation evolving for time @xmath46 at a disk radius @xmath47 and thickness @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( the detailed discussion is reported elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "this is interesting as @xmath50 due to mri computed by previous authors @xcite is similar order of magnitude .",
    "above results verify that the three - dimensional growth rate due to the secondary perturbation in a keplerian disk could be real and positive and corresponding growth may be exponential and significant enough to trigger elliptical instability .",
    "this eventually may trigger non - linearity and then plausible turbulence in the flow time scale . as",
    "this growth is the result of a three - dimensional perturbation , underlying perturbation effect should survive even in presence of viscosity .",
    "we also see that the corresponding viscosity @xmath50 to transport matter inward and angular momentum outward is significant and comparable to that due to mri .",
