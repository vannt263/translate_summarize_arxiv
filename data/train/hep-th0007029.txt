    "the idea that our world is a 3-brane embedded in extra spatial dimensions has been widely discussed as a solution to the weak - scale hierarchy problem @xcite . more recently , attention has been focused on the possibilities for understanding the cosmological constant problem within this setting @xcite ( see @xcite for an earlier treatment ) .",
    "a partial solution was proposed in @xcite ( adks  kss ) , where the addition of a bulk scalar , @xmath5 , plays a crucial role ( see also @xcite for a discussion of the physics of a scalar field coupled to gravity ) .",
    "the scalar is a free field in the bulk , but has nontrivial couplings to fields living on the brane .",
    "@xcite found static solutions of einstein s equations with the property that @xmath5 becomes singular at a finite distance in the extra dimension , and the warp factor for the metric vanishes at the singularity .",
    "if one assumes that the extra dimension terminates at the singularity , or that the warp factor remains integrably small beyond it , then gravity appears to be four dimensional on large distance scales .",
    "most importantly , the scalar field is supposed to adjust itself to any arbitrary value of the tension on the brane , which represents the four - dimensional vacuum energy  or at least that part of it which comes from nongravitational vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the fact that the metric is static means that the effective cosmological constant observed on the 3-brane is zero , regardless of the size of the brane tension .",
    "this could constitute significant progress toward the solution of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the self - tuning mechanism is incomplete in several ways . in its original form in @xcite ,",
    "the orbifold solution requires a very particular exponential coupling of @xmath5 to the matter fields on the brane , @xmath6 , requiring just the right coefficient @xmath7 in the exponent , where @xmath7 is related to the 5-d gravity scale @xmath8 by @xmath9 . as understood by adks , and explicitly realized in refs .",
    "@xcite , different choices of the coupling function @xmath10 give de sitter or anti - de sitter branes in a @xmath11 bulk .",
    "furthermore , the scalar potential in the bulk was assumed to vanish .",
    "ref.@xcite extended the analysis to non - vanishing potentials , and @xcite gave the procedure for finding solutions with arbitrary potentials in the bulk ( see @xcite for an analytic solution associated to a bulk cosmological constant and see @xcite for a discussion of exponential potentials which can be associated with neveu ",
    "schwarz dilaton tadpoles in non - supersymmetric string theories @xcite ) .",
    "actually , as recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath11 symmetric and 4d poincar invariant solution is unstable under bulk quantum corrections : indeed with a conformal coupling allowing flat solution with a vanishing bulk potential , the brane becomes curved as soon as a bulk potential is turned on and the jump equations relate the curvature of the brane to the value of the potential on the brane by @xmath12 .",
    "supersymmetry in the bulk may prevent from such instability .",
    "another difficulty anticipated by @xcite , and explicitly shown by @xcite , is that any procedure which regularizes ( `` resolves '' ) the singularity in the solutions causes the reintroduction of the fine - tuning which self - tuning is supposed to avoid , unless some more explicit dynamical mechanism which automatically relaxes the effects of the brane tension can be demonstrated .",
    "a further possible problem is the claim that when normal matter is added to the brane tension , the brane remains static , in contradiction with cosmology @xcite ( however , see @xcite for a recent tentative to recover usual cosmology ) .    in this letter",
    "we demonstrate a shortcoming which is more severe than the foregoing ones ; namely , starting from the very same lagrangian which gives the static self - tuned solutions , there also exist dynamical solutions , which either begin or end with a singularity as time evolves . in section 2",
    "we will review the static solution , and discuss the conformal symmetry which allows construction of the dynamical solutions .",
    "these constitute a family of solutions , of which the static one is a special example . in section 3",
    "we emphasize that , even starting arbitrarily close to the static solution within this family , the brane world inevitably collapses to a singularity or else expands starting from one , with a hubble parameter of @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "the interpretation is that the static solution is a saddle point , unstable to small perturbations .",
    "the solution on the brane is shown to violate the positive energy condition , reflecting the loss of energy from the brane into the bulk via the scalar field .",
    "these remarks apply in the case when the scalar bulk potential , @xmath15 , vanishes . in section 4",
    "we show that for @xmath16 , our construction can not be trivially applied to generate dynamical solutions .",
    "this gives further motivation for studying the stability of self - tuning solutions with a nonvanishing scalar bulk potential .",
    "the solutions we constructed were independently found by horowitz , low and zee in ref .",
    "@xcite and were interpreted as describing a phase transition .",
    "we will argue in the final section that they actually rather signal an instability of the static solution .",
    "we will consider solutions arising from the action and the definition of the curvature in terms of the metric is such that a euclidean sphere has positive curvature .",
    "bulk indices will be denoted by capital latin indices and brane indices by greek indices : @xmath17 are coordinates on the brane ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 will be the time coordinate and @xmath20 the spatial ones ) , and @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 , if the metric is conformally flat ) is the coordinate along the fifth dimension such that the brane is located at @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) . ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , the determinants the 5-d metric @xmath28 and the 4-d metric induced on the brane , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the bare tension .",
    "the brane is supposed to couple to the bulk in a conformal way defined by the function @xmath10 .",
    "the physical tension is thus given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the value of the scalar field on the brane .",
    "there are many conventions for the normalization of the terms in the bulk part of the action ; to facilitate comparison with other papers we will leave @xmath33 unspecified . we will be primarily concerned with the case of vanishing bulk potential , @xmath34 , but we shall also consider nonzero @xmath15 below .",
    "einstein s equations and the equation of motion for the scalar field read @xmath35 and , for a conformally flat metric with the form @xmath36 , the jump conditions for the derivatives of the fields at the brane are @xmath37^{z=0^+}_{z=0 ^ - } = -\\frac{t}{6\\aaa } f(\\phi_0 ) \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and } \\ \\ \\ \\left [ \\omega^{-1}\\ ,   \\frac{d \\phi}{dz}\\right]^{z=0^+}_{z=0 ^ - } = \\frac{t}{2\\bbb } \\frac{df}{d\\phi } ( \\phi_0).\\ ] ] for a vanishing scalar bulk potential , the self - tuning solution of @xcite with a @xmath11symmetric bulk orbifold is given by @xmath38 where @xmath21 is the proper distance coordinate , @xmath22 is the conformal coordinate for the bulk and @xmath39 however , this solution satisfies the jump conditions ( [ eq : jumpregular ] ) only if the conformal coupling is an exponential function with the particular form @xmath40 then the integration constant , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , is related to the brane tension by @xmath43 and @xmath32 remains unconstrained  which is important for what follows .",
    "a notable peculiarity of this conformal coupling is that it satisfies the following equations everywhere in the bulk : @xmath44 or , in conformal coordinates , @xmath45 hence , the relation between the field derivatives and @xmath5 required by the jump conditions at the brane are satisfied not just there , but everywhere in the bulk .",
    "there is a simple procedure for transforming static bulk solutions into dynamical ones .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , bulk symmetries can be used to construct new solutions involving a singularity interpreted as a brane .",
    "starting from any regular static solution to the bulk equations of motion , written for simplicity in conformal coordinates , @xmath46 we obtain a physically equivalent solution by applying a diffeomorphism @xmath47 however if we orbifold the new solution in the @xmath48 direction , it becomes singular and describes a brane located at @xmath49 .",
    "the orbifold projection and diffeomorphisms do not commute : in general an orbifold solution constructed from ( [ sol - diffeo ] ) is not equivalent under a change of coordinates to an orbifold solution constructed from ( [ sol - static ] ) .",
    "the difficulty consists in finding a diffeomorphism such that the singularities introduced in the right hand side of the equations of motion by the orbifold projection can be associated with the brane components deduced from the action ( [ action ] ) .    in order to preserve the geometry of the brane embedded in the bulk",
    ", we want to restrict ourselves to diffeomorphisms ( [ sol - diffeo ] ) that keep the metric diagonal , @xmath50 a particular subgroup is provided by the 5-d conformal transformations under which the metric remains conformally flat @xmath51 the infinitesimal conformal transformations are generated by the killing vectors @xmath52}x_n + \\lambda x^m + ( x^p\\ ! x_p \\,\\eta^{mn } - 2 x^m x^n)k_n\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54}$ ] , @xmath55 , @xmath56 correspond respectively to translations , lorentz transformations , dilations and special conformal transformations .    in the present case",
    ", a combination of a boost in the @xmath22 direction and a dilation provides a suitable diffeomorphism that will lead to a dynamical solution also satisfying the boundary conditions on the brane .",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a regular solution in the bulk , then it is simple to show that @xmath59 is a @xmath11-symmetric solution to the bulk equations of motion .",
    "this can be checked from the explicit form of the bulk part of the action ( [ action ] ) , which looks like @xmath60.\\ ] ] here the contractions of @xmath61 are performed with the minkowski space metric .",
    "this action has the additional symmetry that , for any constant @xmath62 , leaves the equations of motion invariant : @xmath63 in the case of a vanishing bulk potential , this symmetry implies that @xmath64 is a solution in the bulk . applying the procedure to the regular solution corresponding to ( [ eq : adks1])([eq : adks2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 the nontrivial step is to satisfy the jump equations at the brane , which read @xmath66 these equations are more difficult to satisfy when the solutions are dynamical , because they must remain true for all conformal times @xmath18 .",
    "however , in the present case of a vanishing bulk potential , we notice that , due to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jumpy])([eq : jumpz ] ) , the conformal coupling @xmath67 of the scalar to the brane satisfies the relations ( [ eq : jumpz ] ) for any value of @xmath22 , which ensures that the dynamical solution we construct satisfies the jump equations for any @xmath18 , as can also be explicitly verified .",
    "so from the same lagrangian which gives the static self - tuned solutions , there also exist dynamical solutions for which the induced metric on the brane exhibits time dependence , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the original 4-d poincar invariant solution corresponds to a very particular value of the parameter @xmath68 that characterized our more general family of solutions .",
    "this evades the no - go result of @xcite which excluded the possibility of de sitter or anti - de sitter branes in this case .",
    "the dynamical solution ( [ eq : dyn1])([eq : dyn2 ] ) represents a singularity which is either approaching or receding from the brane , depending on the sign of the continuous parameter @xmath68 .",
    "_ assuming the extra dimension is simply truncated at the singularity _ , the strength of gravity is therefore time - dependent because of the growth or collapse of the extra dimension .",
    "the 4-d planck mass @xmath69 is related to the 5-d analogue @xmath8 by @xmath70    moreover , an observer on the brane will see that his universe , although spatially flat , does not have 4-d poincar invariance , but it is growing or shrinking with a scale factor given by @xmath71 .",
    "in frw time , @xmath72 , the scale factor and the corresponding hubble parameter are given by @xmath73 the universe either begins or ends in a singularity , depending on whether @xmath74 or @xmath75 . for the case",
    "@xmath76 , the static solution of adks is recovered .",
    "therefore one can interpret @xmath68 as the parameter determining how far away from the unstable saddle point solution one is , in the space of all solutions .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar to a 4-d field theory analogy , in which a cosmological `` constant '' @xmath77 is coupled to scalar fields through the lagrangian @xmath78 .\\ ] ] this system also has a saddle point solution , at @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which could be construed as a self - tuning of the cosmological constant to zero .",
    "however , it is not a good solution to the cosmological constant problem because it is unstable against small perturbations . in figure 1(a ) we show the time dependence of the hubble parameter for both the 5-d self - tuning solution and the 4-d toy model , in the case of a collapsing universe , which is the generic outcome for the 4-d model .",
    "although @xmath81 looks rather similar in the two cases , for the 4-d model @xmath82 starts positive and crosses zero , while for the 5-d solution it is always negative .",
    "the differences are more clearly seen in figure 1(b ) , showing the scale factors @xmath83 in frw time .",
    "= 3.4 in = 3.4 in    figure 1 .",
    "( a ) comparison of the hubble parameter as a function of time for the 5-d self - tuning solution and the 4-d toy model ( [ example ] ) , for the case of a collapsing brane - world .",
    "( b ) same , but showing the respective scale factors versus time .",
    "0.5 cm    a further difference between the 5-d solution and any attempt to describe it in a 4-d effective theory is that the 5-d solution appears to violate energy conservation when viewed from the 3-brane . if we were in 4 dimensions , the scale factor dependence in eq .",
    "( [ frw ] ) would correspond to a 4-d stress energy tensor @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "this has the equation of state @xmath86 , which implies that there exists a null vector @xmath87 which , when contracted with @xmath88 , gives a spacelike vector , contrary to the requirement of positivity of @xmath88 .",
    "this is due to the nonconservation of energy on the brane , which can be explicitly demonstrated in the 5-d theory , by computing the singular part of the divergence of the 5-d stress energy tensor and @xmath89 are the physical energy density and pressure describing the matter living on the brane and conformally coupled to the scalar field . ]",
    "@xmath90 in this context , @xmath91 , and in the dynamical solutions , as long as @xmath68 is non - vanishing , @xmath92 is nonzero on the 3-brane , so the right hand side of ( [ conservation ] ) is nonzero .",
    "more simply put , since the physical tension @xmath93 is time - dependent , ) as well as the parameter @xmath68 are of the order of the 4-d planck scale , with the age of the universe estimated to fifteen billions years , today the physical tension would be of the order of @xmath94 , close to the electroweak scale .",
    "] energy is not conserved on the brane .",
    "an interesting question is whether our procedure can be generalized to the case when the bulk potential is nonvanishing .",
    "we do not have a definitive answer , but we can argue that , if dynamical instabilities of the static solution exist , they are much more difficult to find than when @xmath34 .",
    "we are interested in orbifold solutions that can be constructed from a regular bulk solution , @xmath95 and @xmath57 , which satisfies the jump equations ( [ eq : jumpregular ] ) at @xmath24 .",
    "an important property of the vanishing potential solution that facilitated finding dynamic solutions was that the jump equations were actually satisfied for any @xmath22 , not just at @xmath24 .",
    "this property can not be maintained when the scalar potential is turned on , while still having a self - tuning solution .",
    "indeed , it is easy to verify that if the relations ( [ eq : jumpregular ] ) are satisfied for any arbitrary values of @xmath22 , the bulk equations of motion imply the relation @xmath96 between the bulk scalar field and the conformal coupling .",
    "this relation is incompatible with the self - tuning mechanism unless the bulk potential vanishes ; otherwise either @xmath15 or @xmath10 would have to depend on @xmath30 , rather than @xmath32 .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty might be to consider diffeomorphisms @xmath97 such that @xmath49 implies @xmath24 independently of @xmath98 .",
    "but it seems difficult to find such a diffeomorphism that leaves the metric diagonal .",
    "another possibility would consist in relaxing the @xmath11 symmetry in the bulk since a naive count of parameters @xcite shows that an integration constant remains unconstrained by the jump equations and could be promoted to a time - dependent function .",
    "however the continuity of the solution on the brane is no longer guaranteed at each time .",
    "these observations may indicate that the self - tuned solutions in the case of a nonvanishing bulk potential do not suffer from the kind of instability we have found with the adks - kss solution whose pathology comes from the massless and unstabilized scalar field .",
    "we have shown that the adks - kss self - tuning solution is unstable against eternal expansion or singular collapse of the brane - world .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics on the brane can not be represented by a 4-d field theory , since energy flows off the brane into the bulk and thus appears not to be conserved on the brane .",
    "we have suggested that these problems may not occur in the presence of a potential energy in the bulk for the scalar field .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then further indirect evidence would consist in perturbing the brane with matter or radiation , and checking whether it behaves according to normal 4-d cosmology .",
    "we expect , in analogy to brane models without a stabilized radion , that a nonstandard friedmann equation on the brane , such as @xmath99 @xcite , will be a diagnostic of instabilities in the extra dimension , if they exist .",
    "work along these lines is currently in progress @xcite .    in a closely related study ,",
    "horowitz , low and zee recently presented in @xcite a general class of plane wave solutions where the metric is parametrized as @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for arbitrary functions @xmath67 and @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath103 and @xmath104 are generally more complicated , but it is possible to find solutions where @xmath105 and @xmath67 and @xmath102 are both linear functions , which are the same as our solutions . , the relation between the integration constants are @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . ]",
    "interestingly , @xcite interpret these solutions as describing a phase transition claiming that it is possible to start with the static adks - kss solution , at times @xmath109 , and smoothly match it to the dynamical solutions for @xmath110 , provided there is a sudden change @xmath111 in the brane tension at time @xmath112 . this would have demonstrated a physical mechanism for triggering the instability : an arbitrarily small change in the brane tension , such as would occur during a first order phase transition .",
    "however , it does not seem possible to have continuous time derivatives of the fields when such a gluing of the two kinds of solutions is attempted .",
    "must have a dirac delta function at @xmath112 if @xmath113 goes from being a constant to being linear in @xmath19 at @xmath112 .",
    "] such a solution would require that the tension on the brane be proportional to @xmath114 , rather than simply having a discontinuous change .",
    "on the other hand , the property of having dynamical solutions evolving to or from a big crunch or bang with the _ same _ value of the brane tension translates into an instability of the static solution with respect to initial time derivatives since a small perturbation in @xmath115 drives the solution to a nonvanishing value of @xmath68 , and then unavoidably leads to a singularity in the time evolution .",
