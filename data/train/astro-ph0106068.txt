    "recently , astronomers discovered an accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "it is well known that all known types of matter generate attraction , which leads to a decelerated expansion of the universe . that discovery then reveals a new type of matter , which is now called _ quintessence _ or , sometimes , _ dark energy _ @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the presence of dark energy became possible when astronomers recognized that sn ia can be the long expected _",
    "standard candle _ for cosmological investigations .",
    "two main features provide the use of sn ia as a standard candle @xcite :    _ i _ ) they are exceedingly luminous , comparable with luminosity of a whole galaxy ; they can , thus , be detected and observed with high s / n ratio even at cosmological distances .    _ ii _ ) `` normal '' sne ia have small variations among their peak absolute magnitudes ( around 0.3 ) .",
    "the accelerated expansion of our universe was discovered as a result of two projects : the high - z sn search @xcite and the supernova cosmology project @xcite .",
    "in fact , a new type of matter was predicted many years ago by a. einstein , who included a @xmath2-term into his considerations @xcite . at the beginning of the past century",
    ", the @xmath2-term was just a new fundamental constant , and only much later it was really considered as a formidable challenge by both observational and theoretical cosmologists @xcite .",
    "moreover , during the last 20 years cosmologists understood that this constant can be replaced with a scalar field , which induces the repulsive gravitational force dynamically .",
    "accordingly , several models were proposed @xcite , in order to explain the observed present acceleration of our universe .",
    "two of these models continued to be developed after the discovery of acceleration , and were also roughly elaborated and adapted for present - day data @xcite . here",
    ", we again use these models to such an end , but in a much more refined way : the goal is now to fit the observed data of apparent magnitude and redshift of the supernovae ia , and test the models themselves .",
    "as said above , in this paper we discuss two models for quintessence , both based on a scalar field with a special type of potential . the field",
    "is minimally coupled with pressureless matter , and the total density parameter @xmath3 of the universe is fixed to be 1 . a detailed discussion of the consequences of assuming such models in cosmology is given in @xcite , so that we limit ourselves here only to a short summary of the results we need for our purpose .",
    "the main attractive feature of these models is that they allow a general exact solution of the field equations , obtained through a suitable transformation of variables .",
    "anyway , independently of the fact that this is an exact solution , we also find that this solution reflects many properties of the real universe correctly .",
    "the first model considers a potential of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a generic positive constant and @xmath6 is some fixed combination of universal constants @xmath7    actually , this kind of potential has already been widely discussed in the literature , but without any particular assumption on the value of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we stress that it is the particular choice of this constant given above that allows the exact integration of the field equations ( see also @xcite ) .    the general solution of the cosmological equations ( both for the metric and the scalar field ) has five free parameters ( including @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "we fix two of them and keep three as free . but one of these three parameters just determines the present value of the scale factor of our universe , which , in a spatially flat geometry , is not observable .",
    "it is not included into statistical analysis and does not affect the degrees of freedom of our analysis .",
    "we list below only the three cosmological functions which we need in our analysis ( the other ones can be found in @xcite , of course ) @xmath9 they are the redshift of the epoch , the hubble parameter , and the @xmath10 parameter of pressureless matter , and are expressed in terms of the dimensionless time @xmath11 .",
    "the free parameters are then the time scale @xmath12 and the present value of the dimensionless time @xmath13 . le us",
    "remark that @xmath12 is of the same order of magnitude ( but not necessary equal to ) as the age of the universe .    as to the second model",
    ", it considers a potential of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 as before , and @xmath16 and @xmath5 free parameters .",
    "we have , now , one additional free parameter ; therefore , according to the same considerations as above , we have to deal with three of them .    the equations which describe the hubble parameter , the redshift , and the density parameter in the second model are @xmath17 the dimensionless time , in this case , is @xmath18 .",
    "following @xcite , we use here @xmath19 instead of @xmath12 , because of the fact that it is directly connected with the parameters in the potential of the scalar field , and has the meaning of a mass factor in theoretical considerations .",
    "so , the free parameters are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath13 .    in the analysis of the supernovae data",
    ", we use the bolometric distance .",
    "as explained better below , it can be expressed in terms of the `` hubble free '' luminosity distance and of a parameter @xmath21 , connected with the absolute magnitude and the hubble parameter .",
    "the parameters of the first model ( @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) can be recasted into @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters of the second model ( @xmath20 , @xmath13 , and @xmath19 ) can be recasted into @xmath20 , @xmath13 , and @xmath21 .",
    "once the best fit is made , it is easy to compute the relevant physical quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in all the considerations below",
    ", @xmath22 turns out to have the same value as in @xcite .",
    "so , we concentrate on @xmath23 .",
    "the published data of the supernovae consist of 60 sne ia @xcite . the data analysis and the determination of cosmological parameters",
    "can be considered in two steps .",
    "the first one is the measurement of the hubble parameter for close supernovae ( calan - tololo survey ) @xcite , to be compared with the absolute magnitude @xmath24 of a supernova sn ia .",
    "the second step is the comparison of the high redshift supernovae with the theoretical prediction of bolometric distance : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the `` hubble free '' bolometric distance @xmath27 and @xmath21 is a parameter connected to the absolute magnitude and the hubble parameter .    in data presented in @xcite",
    "there are several values for corrected apparent magnitude .",
    "authors consider @xmath28 and stretch luminosity corrected effective @xmath29-band magnitude @xmath30 .",
    "for the analysis of cosmological parameters only @xmath30 is used , together with its errors @xmath31 .",
    "there are several methods for sn ia data analysis .",
    "two of them are used in @xcite .",
    "the first one is the multicolor light curve shape ( mlcs ) method and the second one is a template fitting method . in @xcite",
    "another method is used .",
    "the data of both groups have the statistical errors approximately as @xmath32 .",
    "we follow the authors of paper @xcite to analyze the models described in @xcite .",
    "first of all , as a check of the procedure , we apply the flat cosmological model with a @xmath2-term to fit the data .",
    "the standard @xmath33 algorithm of data analysis reveals a good agreement of our analysis with published statistical values @xcite .",
    "we use the complete set of data of 60 sne ia .",
    "it results @xmath34 per degree of freedom , not significantly different from @xmath35 found in @xcite .",
    "the same is for the @xmath36 parameter . since 4 points in the data are outliers , we can proceed with analysis and exclude these data from our considerations .",
    "the total number of sn ia data then drops to 56 .",
    "the @xmath37 per degree of freedom in this case becomes 1.16 , which is in good agreement with previously published results @xcite and is within @xmath38 level .",
    "in our analysis we use the standard @xmath37 method .",
    "the analysis is done minimizing the value of weitghed @xmath37 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the weight of the @xmath41-th sn ia , @xmath42 is its @xmath29-band effective apparent magnitude , and @xmath43 is its magnitude as predicted with the models introduced before and thoroughly discussed in @xcite .      in the first model , it is possible to eliminate @xmath44 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , and to obtain an analytical expression for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , it is possible to compute @xmath46 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) , and @xmath37 as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath21 .",
    "firstly , we use 60 sn ia data and get the @xmath37 minimum at @xmath47 , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 per degree of freedom . as it is unsatisfactory , we reject data which are out of the 3@xmath8 level , as done in @xcite .    after data rejection ,",
    "the @xmath37 minimum drops down to @xmath50 per degree of freedom .",
    "it is definitely within one sigma level of the expected value of @xmath37 .",
    "the minimum now has other values than @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    if we accept the value of this minimum , we obtain , from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figs .",
    "1  3 .",
    "the second model has only been tested and fitted with 56 data of sne ia .",
    "the number of parameters in this case is equal to three .",
    "the true minimum of the @xmath55 is at @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "we find a value of @xmath59 , which is definitely within one sigma level of expected value .",
    "after such value we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( 9 ) that @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath55 value is a function of three arbitrary values : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath55 as a function of all parameters is impossible to plot , but we can nonetheless plot several slits .    the situation is illustrated in figs .",
    "in a quintessential universe we have analyzed the same data as in @xcite , where it is present only a cosmological constant , and found good values for @xmath64 in both cases .",
    "the values of @xmath23 found are rather different from the one found in @xcite , but it is impossible to say if this is due to differences in the models or to influence of the measurement errors on the final values .",
    "in fact , in both models we have degeneracy in the parameters , particularly large in @xmath20 ( ii model ) .",
    "this makes impossible to give significant confidence limits for the values of @xmath0 , which we found .",
    "only very rough estimates can be given .",
    "our main results are summarized in the following tables .         as final remarks , we want to observe that our results are in a very good agreement with the one found in @xcite in a completely independent way , and that the high degeneracy we get for the model parameters seems to support the opinion of those who claim that it is very difficult to discriminate among theories on the basis of observational data only @xcite .",
