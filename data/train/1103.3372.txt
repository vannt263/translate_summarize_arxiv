    "the notion of lyapunov function plays a very important role in design and verification of dynamical systems , in particular , in performance analysis , stability analysis and controller synthesis of complex dynamical and controlled systems @xcite . in recent years",
    ", people realized that the notion is quite helpful to safety verification of hybrid and cyber - physical systems as well @xcite .",
    "however , the following two issues hinder the application of lyapunov functions in practice .",
    "firstly , it is actually not necessary for the first - order lie derivative of a lyapunov function to be strictly negative to guarantee asymptotic stability , which is shown by _",
    "lasalle s invariance principle _ @xcite .",
    "such a condition could limit to scale up the method . secondly ,",
    "in general there is no effective way so far to find lyapunov functions , although many methods have been proposed by different experts using their field expertise .    to address the above two issues , in this paper , we first generalize the standard concept of lyapunov function to _ relaxed lyapunov function _ ( rlf ) for asymptotic stability analysis . compared with the conventional definition of lyapunov function ,",
    "the first non - zero higher order lie derivative of rlf is required to be negative , rather than its first - order lie derivative .",
    "such a relaxation extends the set of admissible functions that can be used to prove asymptotic stability .",
    "another contribution of this paper is that we present a complete method to automatically discovering polynomial rlfs for polynomial dynamical systems ( pdss ) .",
    "the basic idea of our method is to predefine a parametric polynomial as a template of rlf first , and then utilize the lie derivatives of the template at different orders to generate constraint on the parameters , and finally solve the resulting constraint .",
    "our method is complete in the sense that it is able to generate all polynomial rlfs by enumerating all polynomial templates for any pds .",
    "* related work . * in @xcite , the same terminology  relaxed lyapunov function \" is used , with a different definition .",
    "the idea of applying higher order lie derivatives to analyze asymptotic stability is not new .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors resorted to certain linear combinations of higher order lie derivatives with non - negative coefficients such that the combination is always negative .",
    "this method could be included in the framework of vector lyapunov functions method @xcite .",
    "our method is essentially different from theirs because an rlf only requires its first non - zero higher order lie derivative to be negative .    in the literature , there is a lot of work on constructing lyapunov functions .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , methods for constructing common quadratic lyapunov functions for linear systems were proposed , which were generalized in @xcite and @xcite for nonlinear systems wherein the generated lyapunov functions are not necessarily quadratic .",
    "another useful technique is the linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) method introduced in @xcite and @xcite , which enables us to utilize the results of numerical optimization for discovering piecewise quadratic lyapunov functions .",
    "based on sums - of - squares ( sos ) decomposition and semi - definite programmng ( sdp ) @xcite , a method for constructing piecewise high - degree polynomial and piecewise non - polynomial lyapunov functions was proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sos and sdp based method was also used in @xcite to search for control lyapunov functions for polynomial systems . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a new method for computing lypunov functions for polynomial systems by solving semi - algebraic constraint using their tool discoverer @xcite .",
    "approaches to constructing lyapunov functions beyond polynomials using radial basis functions were proposed in @xcite .    our method has the following features compared to the related work .",
    "firstly , it generates relaxed lyapunov functions rather than conventional lyapunov functions .",
    "secondly , it is able to discover all polynomial rlfs by enumerating all polynomial templates for any pds , whereas the krasovskii s method @xcite and zubov s method @xcite can only produce lyapunov functions of special forms .",
    "thirdly , the lmi method and sos method are numerical , while our method is symbolic , which means it could provide a mathematically rigorous framework for the stability analysis of polynomial dynamical systems .",
