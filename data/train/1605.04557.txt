    "the spreading dynamics is one of the hottest research topics in network science , which has attracted extensive attention from scholars in physics , mathematics , biology and other fields .",
    "the spreading dynamics aims to reveal the mechanisms in real spreading processes such as epidemic spreading , information spreading , behavior contagion and innovation diffusion , and further provides the theoretical support for forecasting and controlling these processes  @xcite .",
    "the spreading dynamics can be divided into biological spreading and social contagion .",
    "the former focuses on the spreads of disease or virus on networks  @xcite , while the latter mainly studies contagions of information and behaviors on networks  @xcite . the social reinforcement effect in social contagion",
    "is the essential difference between biological spreading and social contagion  @xcite , which contains the idea that adoption behaviors of an individual often depends on his neighbors attitudes to the behavior  @xcite . for an individual , who has two friends having",
    "adopted a particular behavior before a _ given time _ and whose third friend newly adopts the behavior , his / her decision to adopt this behavior will take all the three friends into account .    for social contagions , researches focus on how social reinforcement effect influences the spreads of behaviors on static networks .",
    "the markovian linear threshold model is a classic social contagion model to describe this reinforcement effect  @xcite . in the model ,",
    "an individual that has not adopted a behavior becomes an adopter only when the number or proportion of its adopted neighbors exceeds a threshold .",
    "watts found that the final behavior adoption proportion , following the increase of average degree , first grows continuously and then decreases discontinuously  @xcite .",
    "in fact , an individual s decision to adopt a behavior not only depends on the _ current state _ of his / her neighbors , but also considers the behavioral information he has received .",
    "so the social reinforcement effect based on memory thus becomes an essential characteristic of social contagions . to describe the memory effect ( i.e. , non - markovian effect ) , wang _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a social contagion model based on non - redundant memory information , and found that the behavior adoption proportion versus the information transmission rate could exhibit a continuous growth or behavior as a discontinuous growth  @xcite .",
    "they also found that the individual s limited contact capacity would reduce the final behavior adoption proportion  @xcite .",
    "the latest empirical studies showed that the connections among individuals in social networks vary with time , which can not be described by the static network . to this end , the conception of time - varying network ( or temporal networks , dynamical networks ) was proposed  @xcite .",
    "proposed an activity - driven network model to describe time - varying networks  @xcite , which allows for an explicit representation of dynamical connectivity patterns . at each time step , every node becomes active or not according to its active potential .",
    "if a node becomes active , it will randomly connect to some nodes and form an instantaneous network structure . spreading processes in activity - driven networks model show striking differences with respect to the well - known results obtained in quenched and annealed networks .",
    "_ found that the outbreak threshold of sis model on an activity driven network is greater than that of the corresponding aggregated network  @xcite .",
    "_ found that a disease spreads slower on activity driven networks than it does on the corresponding aggregated networks , and the invasion threshold on the former was hundreds of times greater than that of the latter  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ studied the threshold model on the time - varying networks based on empirical data , and found that time - varying network structures could enhance the final behavior adoption proportion  @xcite .",
    "community structures exist ubiquitously in real world networks  @xcite , greatly affecting the spreading dynamics .",
    "for example , liu _",
    "_ found that community structures make the epidemic spread more easily on static networks  @xcite , and ahn _",
    "_ found that there is an optimal community strength which can greatly promote the social contagions  @xcite .",
    "recent empirical studies showed that community structures also exists on time - varying networks  @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of time - varying community structures on social contagion are little studied and full of challenges . on the one hand , the contacts on time - varying community networks change over time and do not happen continuously . on the other hand , the social reinforcement effects lead to the non - markovian characteristic , making the existing theoretical method on static network difficult to accurately describe the spreading processes . in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the effects of time - varying community structures on social contagions .",
    "firstly , we propose a non - markovian social contagion model on time - varying community networks .",
    "then , we develop a mean - field theory to quantify this contagion process and verify the accuracy of our predictions via extensive numerical simulations . with analyses and simulations",
    ", we find that behavior adoption exhibits a hierarchical feature : the behavior first spreads in one of the communities , and then outbreaks in the other .",
    "moreover , under different transmission rates , the final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network versus community strength shows one of the following three patterns , which are an increasing pattern , a non - monotonic changing pattern , and a monotone decreasing pattern .",
    "an optimal community strength maximizing the final behavior adoption proportion can be found in a suitable transmission rate range .",
    "moreover , we find that for a given average degree , adding the edges generated by active individuals is more beneficial to social contagions than increasing the average activity potential .",
    "in order to study the effects of time - varying community networks on social contagions , we propose a non - markovian social contagion model on activity - driven community network .",
    "we generate a time - varying community network based on the activity driven network model  @xcite . to simplify analysis",
    ", we suppose a network with @xmath0 nodes ( representing individuals ) , consisting of two communities @xmath1 and @xmath2 with equal sizes .",
    "initially , each node is assigned an equal activity potential @xmath3 .",
    "the instantaneous network structure @xmath4 is generated as below : at time step @xmath5 , each node is activated with probability @xmath3 .",
    "if a node @xmath6 is activated , it will generate @xmath7 edges , each of which randomly connects to a node in the same community with probability @xmath8 , called community strength , and connect to a node in the different community with probability @xmath9  [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] .",
    "multiple edges and self - loops are not allowed . in order to form community structures",
    ", we set @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "obviously , there will be less edges between the communities with the increase of @xmath8 .",
    "for a small value of @xmath8 , the community structure is not obvious .",
    "note that when @xmath11 , the probabilities of an edge connecting to the same and the different communities are equal , and the edges are connected completely randomly , thus the time - varying community structures disappear .",
    "when @xmath12 , there is no edges between communities , leading to two totally isolated communities . at the end of time step @xmath5",
    ", we delete all the generated edges . repeating",
    "the above process generates a time - varying community network .",
    "we propose a non - markovian social contagion model , called susceptible - adopted - recovered ( sar ) model , to describe behavior spreading on time - varying community networks  @xcite . at a given time step",
    ", a node can be in one of the three states : susceptible , adopted , and recovered . in the susceptible state ,",
    "a node has not adopted the behavior and is willing to receive behavioral information from its neighbors who has adopted the behavior . in the adopted state ,",
    "a node who has adopted the behavior and is keen to spread the behavioral information to its neighbors . in the recovered state",
    ", a node will lose its interest to the behavior and no longer anticipate the spreading process .",
    "each node holds a static equal adoption threshold @xmath13 , which reflects the wills of this node to adopt the behavior .",
    "each node has variable @xmath14 to count how many pieces of behavioral information it has received .    at the beginning , a proportion @xmath15 of nodes are randomly chosen as seeds ( initial adopters ) , while the remaining nodes are susceptible .",
    "we use synchronous updating method to update nodes state  @xcite . at each time step",
    ", we first generate an instantaneous structure @xmath4 according to the method described in sec .",
    "then , the behavior spreads on network @xmath4 as follows .",
    "every adopted node @xmath6 transmits the behavioral information to each susceptible neighbor @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath16 receives the information successfully , his corresponding accumulated information counter @xmath18 will add one .",
    "if @xmath18 reaches or exceeds the adoption threshold @xmath13 , the node @xmath16 becomes adopted state .",
    "the dynamics of social contagion is a non - markovian stochastic process . for the case of @xmath19 ,",
    "the model becomes memoryless , thus we only discuss the situations when @xmath20 . at the same time step ,",
    "the adopted nodes become recovered with probability @xmath21 .",
    "the contagion process terminates when all adopted nodes become recovered . in this model , the probabilities @xmath17 and @xmath21 can be interpreted as transmission rate and recover rate respectively , for they are expected to equal to the proportion of information successfully arrived and nodes turning into recover state at each time step .",
    "an illustration of our social contagion model on time - varying community network is given in fig .",
    "in this section , we develop a mean - field approximation theory to quantitatively describe the non - markovian social contagions on time - varying community network .",
    "we denote the proportion of susceptible nodes who have received @xmath22 pieces of behavioral information in community @xmath1 and community @xmath2 at time step @xmath5 as @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( denominator is @xmath25 ) , respectively .",

    "the final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network is then @xmath33/2 $ ] , since communities @xmath1 and @xmath2 have the same size .",
    "due to the symmetry of the two communities , we only introduce the theoretical analyses on community @xmath1 detailedly , and the results on community @xmath2 can be derived by simply exchanging the index @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at time step @xmath5 , a node @xmath34 forms its @xmath35 edges in the instantaneous structure @xmath4 in two different ways : ( i ) edges generated by @xmath34 itself , denoted as its out - going degree @xmath36 ; ( ii ) edges generated by other active nodes in the network connecting to @xmath34 , denoted as its in - coming degree @xmath37 . as a result ,",

    "<S> to this end , we systematically study the effects of time - varying community structures on social contagions . </S>",
    "<S> we first propose a non - markovian social contagion model on time - varying community networks based on the activity driven network model , in which an individual adopts a behavior if and only if the accumulated behavioral information it has ever received reaches a threshold . </S>",
    "<S> then , we develop a mean - field theory to describe the proposed model . from theoretical analyses and numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we find that behavior adoption in the social contagions exhibits a hierarchical feature , i.e. , the behavior first quickly spreads in one of the communities , and then outbreaks in the other . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , under different behavioral information transmission rates , the final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network versus the community strength shows one of the patterns , which are a monotone increasing pattern , a non - monotonic changing pattern , and a monotone decreasing pattern . </S>",
    "<S> an optimal community strength maximizing the final behavior adoption can be found in a suitable range of behavioral information transmission rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for a given average degree , increasing the number of edges generated by active nodes is more beneficial to the social contagions than increasing the average activity potential . </S>"
