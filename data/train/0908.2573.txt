    "t tauri stars are recently formed low - mass stars ( @xmath4 ) , with spectral type ranging from f to m , and radius of no more than @xmath5 .",
    "they are the predecessors of solar - like stars that are still in the pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase . usually , t tauri stars are classified in two categories : classical and weak - lined .",
    "a classical t tauri star ( ctts ) shows strong emission line activity , excess ultraviolet and infrared emissions , which are associated with accretion flows and the presence of circumstellar disks .",
    "a weak - lined t tauri star ( wtts ) , on the other hand , has a weaker emission line activity and shows little or no trace of accretion , implying that the accretion disk has been dissipated .",
    "for this reason , they are also known as naked t tauri stars .",
    "wttss also show radio and x - ray flare activity that is usually explained as a scaled - up magnetic activity similar to the one observed in the sun . in the sun , highly detailed observations of the magnetic field , using both _ in situ _ and",
    "remote measurements , have shown a very complex magnetic configuration .",

    "as observational techniques are becoming more accurate , detection of a more complex magnetic field geometry in young stars has just started to be accomplished , for example , the cttss v2129 oph @xcite , bp tau @xcite , and cv cha & cr cha @xcite where surface magnetic maps have been derived from spectropolarimetric data .",
    "another system , v773 tau a , a young binary system consisted of two wttss , is known to posses high levels of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "recently , observed two extended radio emissions that were interpreted as associated to the primary and secondary stars of the system .",
    "they suggested that these features were produced by helmet streamer structures from each of the stars , that when overlapped at certain orbital phases , would result in reconnection producing the giant flares that were observed : radio emission would increase from a few mjy at apastron to more than 100 mjy at periastron . in another recent work ,",
    "@xcite reported the findings of slingshot prominences on twa6 , another wtt star . in their interpretation",
    ", such magnetic prominence extends for about @xmath6 stellar radii , which is beyond the corotation radius located at @xmath7 stellar radii .",
    "magnetic field extrapolations from surface magnetograms have also shown that the geometry of the large - scale field of t tauri stars may be very complex @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to investigate the magnetic configuration of the corona of wttss using three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) numerical simulations .",
    "t tauri stars are believed to be magnetized , and rotating several times faster than the sun , hence it is important to consider a magneto - centrifugal wind .",
    "the first theoretical models to analyze the effects of both rotation and magnetic field on stellar winds are ( * ? ? ?",

    "recently , theoretical and numerical efforts were made towards the study of more realistic magneto - centrifugal winds in different systems .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the influence of stellar rotation on the wind structure and acceleration of magnetized main - sequence solar - like stars investigating the effects of the centrifugal force .",
    ", on the other hand , analyzed the impact of a purely radial field on the wind .",
    "the stellar field , although radial , was taken to have a non - uniform distribution in the stellar surface , as to account for the non - uniform surface magnetic flux distribution observed in active stars .",
    "@xcite aiming to explain the low rotation rates observed in cttss , studied the role of an accretion powered stellar wind in the spinning down of a typical ctts .",
    "all these works have confirmed that the structure of a magnetized stellar wind significantly depends on both the field intensity and topology . in @xcite , we performed an analysis of coronal winds in main - sequence solar - like stars .",
    "we showed that a decisive parameter in the acceleration of the magnetized wind of a solar - like star is the plasma-@xmath0 at the coronal base . using 3d mhd self - consistent simulations",
    ", we explored how the change in the magnetic and thermal energy densities at the base of the wind modifies the magnetic configuration of the corona and the velocity profile of the wind .",
    "rotation was not considered in that work .",
    "we now investigate the magnetic configuration of the winds of wttss . in our models",
    "we vary different physical parameters of the systems , such as stellar rotation period , and magnetic field intensity and gas density at the base of the wind .",
    "in particular , we investigate the occurrence of helmet streamers or slingshot prominences , as well as their shape and extension .",
    "we perform self - consistent time - dependent 3d numerical simulations , including centrifugal , magnetic , gravitational , and thermal forces .",
    "the full set of mhd equations are solved to obtain the steady - state solution for the large - scale magnetic configuration of a ttauri star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we present the numerical scheme used , in  3 we describe our choice of parameters used in the simulations , and in  4 , we present and discuss the results obtained . in  5 , we analyze planetary migration due to drag forces exerted by the magnetized stellar wind on `` hot - jupiters '' , giant planets orbiting very close to the host star ( @xmath8  au ) .  6",

    "to perform the simulations , we make use of the block adaptive tree solar - wind roe upwind scheme ( bats - r - us ) , a 3d mhd numerical code developed at the center for space environment modeling at university of michigan @xcite .",

    "we adopt , therefore , an approach similar to @xcite who considered that @xmath25 is associated with `` turbulent '' internal degrees of freedom , in a way analogous to the sun , where a significant amount of energy is stored in the form of waves and turbulent fluctuations .",

    "as the magnetic energy density is latitude dependent and the thermal pressure is held constant at the base of the wind , the plasma-@xmath0 at the surface of the star is minimum at the pole . the mhd solution is evolved in time from the initial dipolar configuration for the magnetic field to a fully self - consistent non - dipolar solution , until steady state is achieved .",

[ fig : velocity ] , we present meridional plots for cases a , e , and f : the plots show contours of the poloidal velocity , the black lines are streamlines of magnetic fields , and the white lines represent the alfv ' en surface ( where the poloidal velocity of the wind equals the local alfv ' en velocity ) .",
    "the first immediate conclusion is that the configuration of the magnetic field lines is very different in each case .",
    "case e ( fig .  [ fig : velocity]a ) presents a dipolar - like configuration of the magnetic field lines . in case",

    "+     as discussed in @xcite in the context of non - rotating main - sequence solar - like stars , the plasma-@xmath0 is a decisive parameter in the acceleration of the wind .",
    "when the magnetic energy density is of the same order as the thermal energy density , as in case e ( fig .  [ fig : velocity]a ) , the magnetic configuration remains approximately that of a dipole .",
    "otherwise , when the magnetic energy density dominates over the thermal energy density , the wind is accelerated reaching a situation where the flow ram pressure is able to distort the initial magnetic configuration , as in case f ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity]c ) .",
    "in addition to the acceleration of the flow , as a consequence of the lorentz force , the wind velocity becomes more anisotropic with the decrease of @xmath49 . among the cases we analyzed ,",
    "case e ( and also b ) presents velocity profiles resembling spherical symmetry and in case f , where @xmath74 ( high magnetic energy density ) , the wind is visibly divided into a region of fast speeds at high latitudes and slow speeds at low latitudes .",
    "a comparison between cases a and f , where open - field lines are found , shows that : ( i ) case f shows higher collimation of lines towards the axis of rotation ; ( ii ) the ratio of open to closed field line is larger in case f. as the magneto - centrifugal forces are responsible for the collimation of lines along the axis of rotation , it is expected that a wind more magnetically dominated would present higher levels of collimation ( considering same stellar rotation rate ) .",
    "the reason why there are more open magnetic field lines in case f is mainly due to the flow speed : the high wind velocities stretch and open the previously closed - field lines . as",
    "the polar wind is faster in case f , it is natural to expect a higher ratio of open to closed field line when compared to case a.    these results also show that longer streamers will be present only if @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of elongated magnetic features has been recently considered to explain observations of recurrent radio flares in binary systems composed of t tauri stars . in these systems ,",
    "the elongated magnetic features belonging to both stars could overlap in certain orbital phases , resulting in a modification of the magnetic configuration ( reconnection ) .",
    "this picture could account for giant radio flares , emitted when the binary system is near periastron .",

    "therefore , the observations of radio flares can help us constrain the coronal density in these stars .",
    "pms stars exhibit x - ray flares occuring in star - sized , small structures , often interpreted as scaled - up solar - like coronal activities @xcite .",
    "in addition , intense x - ray flares are also observed .",
    "@xcite analyzed these intense x - ray flare decays to model physical parameters of the flaring structure , finding that these large flares take place in very long magnetic structures , extending out to several stellar radii .",
    "@xcite also argued that in fast rotating stars these powerful x - ray flares extend beyond the corotation radius , where centrifugal forces dominate over gravity .",
    "they conclude that the flares arise in traditional solar - type magnetic loops , where both footpoints are anchored in the stellar surface .",
    "@xcite developed a model for magnetic loops in rapidly rotating main - sequence stars that explains the existence of magnetic prominences that can extend out to heights of @xmath82-@xmath83 , above the corotation radius , in equilibrium with the open field region . in our simulations , we observed an extended , slender closed field region in case f. in this case , the extension of the streamer is assured up to an equatorial radius of @xmath84 . above this point , the grid changes resolution , causing a local numerical reconnection ( in principle , the loop could extend farther out ) . at the equatorial plane ,",
    "the corotation radius is given by @xmath85 which for the tts simulated here is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the stellar rotation period measured in days .",
    "for @xmath88  d , @xmath89 .",
    "this shows that the elongated streamers , as obtained in case f , is stable to at least @xmath90 times the corotation radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : velocity2 ] shows the steady - state solutions for the remaining of the simulations presented in table  [ table:4 ] .",
    "we enumerate the following conclusions : ( _ i _ ) we show that only a change in the rotation of the star does not provide a significant change in the poloidal velocity profile of the system ( compare cases a and d , f and g ) .",
    "it changes , however , how the magnetic field lines are twisted : the faster is the rotation of the star , the larger is the @xmath47-component of the magnetic field .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the heating parameter @xmath25 influences the thermal acceleration of the wind ( compare cases a and c ) , being more accelerated in the case where the parametrized energy input is higher , i.e. , for low @xmath25 . as the wind characteristics are different , the resultant interaction with the magnetic field is different : case a ( high @xmath25 ) presents a larger ratio of open to close lines than case c ( case c has a larger closed - field line region ) .",
    "( _ iii _ ) cases b and e present the same characteristics , as they possess the same @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath91 , there is an equipartition of thermal and magnetic energy densities at the base of the corona , which results in lower velocities and field lines that are merely modified in relation to the initial configuration , resembling a dipole .",
    "( _ iv _ ) case g represents a star with a high rotation rate . because of this , among the cases we analyzed",
    ", it is the case where the open field lines are more collimated towards the axis of rotation . comparing it to case f , where the rotation rate is 6 times smaller",

    "( [ eq.pram ] ) to ( [ eq.time-scale ] ) .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tw ] , where the solid lines represent the results obtained using our model and the dashed lines for the wd model .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    , title=\"fig : \" ] +    , title=\"fig : \" ]    figures  [ fig : tw]a and [ fig : tw]b show , respectively , the effective cross - section of the planet and the ram pressure exerted on the planet for the region inside @xmath118au ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) . it can be seen that when @xmath109 is large , @xmath111 is small , and vice - versa .",
    "in addition , @xmath111 ( @xmath109 ) calculated from our stellar wind model is larger ( smaller ) than if it were calculated using the wd model .",
    "this is because , for the wd model , @xmath109 is verified to be essentially magnetic , i.e. , the first term of the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq.pram ] ) is negligible compared to the second one , while for our stellar wind model , both terms are significant . in addition , for both models , the first term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq.pram ] ) are of the same order .",
    "the difference thus comes from the magnetic term of eq .",
    "( [ eq.pram ] ) , that for the wd model is larger than for our model .",

    "solid lines are the total ram pressures , i.e. , the sum of first and second terms .",
    "[ fig : pram ] ]    this results in larger time - scales as compared to the wd model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tw]c ) , which implies that the more realistic winds simulated in the present paper are not expected to have significant influence on hot - jupiter migrations .",
    "the time - scales we estimate ( e.g. , @xmath120  myr for cases a and f , for @xmath121 ) are much larger than the ones estimated by @xcite ( @xmath122  myr ) .",
    "other effects , such as an increase in the base density or magnetic field intensity , can reduce @xmath107 .",
    "case e presents the highest base density , while case f presents the lowest one among our simulations . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tw]c , we note that an increase in @xmath48 reduces @xmath107 .",
    "we expect that for @xmath123  g  @xmath69 with the remaining parameters as adopted in cases a , e and f , the effects of the migration will be more significant .",
    "a similar trend , i.e. , a decrease in @xmath107 , is also expected if one increases @xmath44 .",
    "for example , cases a , e and f assume @xmath124  kg . if such value were increased , it would result in a larger ram pressure exerted by the wind on the planet .",
    "this would cause a more efficient drag and ultimately it would lower @xmath107 , and perhaps it would even become smaller than @xmath125  myr in the region where @xmath126 . in this case , the more realistic winds could have a more significant influence on the giant planet migration , though it would still have @xmath107 much larger than the one computed with the wd model .    according to @xcite",
    ", the magnetic winds are expected to be important for planet migration for the case of a multipolar magnetic field rather than a dipole field . in the present paper",
    ", we extend this statement to the case of the multi - field component coronae , as the ones analyzed previously , where open and closed field lines coexist .",
    "our model suggests that the stellar wind of these modified - dipole coronae are not expected to have significant influence on hot - jupiters migration .",
    "if the wind azimuthal velocity @xmath127 is greater than the planet keplerian velocity , @xcite showed that the stellar wind causes the planet to move outwards . in all the simulations we presented , this is the case only for case g , for @xmath128 .",
    "for all the other cases , the wind would act as to push the planet inwards , and the closest the planet is from the star , the stronger / faster would be this dragging .",
    "an aspect that is not investigated in the present paper is when the surface dipole is tilted with respect to the stellar rotation axis .",
    "the wind ram pressure is an interplay between magnetic ( @xmath129 ) and kinetic terms ( @xmath130 ^ 2 $ ] ) . in the tilted case , a planet orbiting the rotation equator",
    "would be subjected to high magnetic field intensities ( since @xmath131 is maximum at the magnetic pole and minimum at the magnetic equator ) .",
    "however , it is unclear the latitudinal dependence of @xmath127 : in the aligned case , @xmath127 is maximum at the equator ; in the misaligned case and in a highly magnetized ambient , the stellar magnetic field is expected to channel the rotating outflow .",
    "hence , by a superposition of the magnetic and kinematic effects , it could be possible that @xmath107 becomes smaller in a tilted configuration .",
    "a future work will explore this scenario .",
    "another interesting configuration is when the orbital axis of the planet is inclined with respect to the spin axis of the star , as it is believed to occur , e.g. , in the extra - solar planets hd80606b and xo-3b . in this configuration",
    ", the planet would interact with a stellar field strength that is larger at the position of the planet than at the magnetic equator .",
    "this could have an effect on @xmath107 that could reduce it .",
    "recent works indicate the presence of complex magnetic structure , as the one observed in the sun , on t tauri stars . this structure is certainly influencing the winds of these stars .",
    "wtts offers a tool for studying the magnetic behavior of low - mass pre - main - sequence stars with the benefit that it is no longer strongly influenced by the presence of an accretion disk . as a consequence",
    ", the study of wtts may eventually have applications on theories of cttss and also clues on the physical conditions for planetary formation and/or migration .    in the present work",
    ", we showed 3d mhd numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds in rotating t tauri stars . with the parameters we selected , we scan the possible values of rotation period ( @xmath60  d to @xmath56  d ) , magnetic field intensities ( @xmath65  g to @xmath50",
    "kg ) , and surface density ( @xmath132 to @xmath133  g  @xmath69 ) .",
    "we show that the plasma-@xmath0 parameter is a crucial parameter in the acceleration of the wind and in shaping the magnetic field lines .",
    "if the surface magnetic and thermal energy densities are equal at the pole , i.e. @xmath91 , we showed that : ( i ) the wind presents approximately spherical symmetry ; ( ii ) the magnetic field lines are not significantly distorted from the dipolar field we assume as initial condition of the simulation ; ( iii ) the wind velocity does not differ considerably from the hydrodynamical case . on the other hand , if the magnetic energy density is much greater than the thermal one , i.e. @xmath1 , we observed departure of spherical symmetry .",
    "the wind shows two different components of the velocity , being faster at high latitudes and slower at low latitudes . in addition , the field lines are not anymore dipolar : the high velocity of the flow is able to stretch and open the field lines at high latitudes , while in low latitudes we observe elongated magnetic features .",
    "this indicates that streamer structures should be present in wttss with @xmath1 .    in a different context",
    ", @xcite defined a similar parameter that is used as an indicator of the effectiveness of magnetic fields in channeling outflow from hot supergiant stars .",
    "the `` magnetic confinement parameter '' , defined by them as the ratio between the magnetic and kinetic wind energy densities , operates in a similar fashion as @xmath49 operates in our work : it identifies whether the magnetic field will play a significant role in the acceleration of the wind .",
    "however , both in the present work and in @xcite , the thermal energy of the ( coronal ) wind is more significant then the kinetic energy , while in the line - driven winds studied by @xcite , the kinetic energy is more important than the thermal energy of the wind .",
    "we also show that when the self - consistent interaction of the field lines and the wind is taken into account , the picture of approximately radial streamers ( near the star ) , as observed in the sun , is not anymore verified for the wttss with rotation periods up to @xmath134  d : both open and closed lines are twisted .    with typical parameters of wttss",
    ", we estimate the time - scale for planet migration due to the torque exerted by the azimuthal ram pressure of the stellar winds , and we showed that for the multi - component corona of a wtts simulated here , this migration mechanism is not important , in contrast to the results from @xcite , who argued that magnetic winds computed using the wd model are expected to be important for planet migration .",
    "further simulations with a greater parameter range ( higher magnetic field intensity or higher density at the coronal base ) or different system configurations ( a tilted stellar magnetosphere or a tilted planetary orbit with respect to the stellar spin axis ) may reduce the time - scale to significantly affect the orbital radius of the planet . for instance , if we consider a magnetic field intensity of @xmath82 - @xmath3  kg , still consistent with values derived from zeeman - broadening measurements @xcite , a reduction in @xmath107 is expected , as the ram pressure of the wind increases .",
