    "the evolution of galaxies and galaxy systems may be understoood in terms of a competition between two processes .",
    "one is the dominant gravitational drive of the dark matter ( dm ) that leads to hierarchical clustering ; this builds up `` haloes '' that grow larger and deeper by the merging of smaller clumps ( see peebles 1993 ) , and yet remain closely _ self - similar _ , i.e. , with central densities and profiles which are nearly scaled versions of each other ( see navarro et al . 1995 ) . the other process is the active _ response _ of the baryons contained in such potential wells ; this strives to drive the radiative structures _",
    "away _ from self - similarity .",
    "groups and clusters of galaxies provide an ideal testing ground for such a picture . on the one hand ,",
    "their deep gravitational wells are dominated by dm masses ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "their sizes may be defined by the virial radius @xmath8 where the dm density @xmath9 at formation exceeds by a factor of about @xmath10 the background value @xmath11 ; they scale as @xmath12 , and match or exceed @xmath13 mpc for the rich clusters .",
    "the well depths may be measured in terms of the circular velocities @xmath14 , which attain or exceed 1400 km s@xmath15 in rich clusters today .    on the other hand",
    ", such wells also contain large masses of diffuse baryons , of order @xmath16 ( white et al . 1993 ; white & fabian 1995 ; fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) ; these are in the state of a hot plasma , the intra - cluster medium or icm .",
    "its temperatures may be estimated on assuming also the icm to be in virial equilibrium ; this provides the scaling @xmath17 , and values in the range @xmath18 kev in going from poor groups to rich clusters . by and large ,",
    "these results are confirmed by the observations of many high - excitation lines at kev energies and of the x - ray continuum .",
    "in fact , the icm is well observable at x - ray energies through its thermal bremsstrahlung emission @xmath19 , which from groups to rich clusters ranges from @xmath20 to several @xmath21 erg s@xmath15 for typical densities @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "but the same hot electrons also inverse - compton upscatter the photons of the cmb , and thus they tilt slightly the black - body spectrum toward higher energies ; at microwave wavelengths the result toward individual clusters is an apparent intensity decrement @xmath24 in terms of the compton parameter @xmath25 .",
    "numerical values @xmath26 had been predicted by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1972 ) ( hence the acronym sz effect ) , and are being measured in a growing number of rich clusters ; for reviews and recent data , see rephaeli ( 1995 ) , birkinshaw ( 1999 ) , carlstrom et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , saunders & jones ( 2000 ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath0 and of related observables from a comprehensive model for the thermal state of the icm constitutes the main scope of the present paper ; its plan is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss how the sz probe fits into the current debate concerning the role of non - gravitational processes in setting the thermal state of the icm . in ",
    "3 we describe how we compute such state , and how our model fits into the current efforts toward including star formation and other baryonic processes in the hierarchical clustering picture ; at the end of the section we show how the sz observables are computed on the basis of our specific model . in ",
    "4 we present our results and predictions concerning the @xmath1 relation and the integrated sz observables , namely , the source counts and the average compton parameter @xmath27 . in  5",
    "we discuss the building blocks of our model , and make contact with other related works ; we also stress the generic aspects of the link between the @xmath1 and the @xmath5 relations . in the final  6",
    "we summarize our predictions and conclusions .",
    "before we embark into technical issues , we discuss the framework of observations and theories in which the present work is to fit .",
    "the simplest picture of the icm would have its thermal energy to be of purely gravitational origin ; that is to say , originated only by gravitational energy released on large scales comparable with @xmath8 as the external gas falls into the self - similar potential wells provided by the dm ( kaiser 1986 ) , and thermalized by some effective coupling . by itself , the process would establish temperatures @xmath28 and produce self - similar icm distributions in the wells , with central densities @xmath29 just proportional to the dm density @xmath9 , hence to the external @xmath30 . if so , the dm scaling recast into the form @xmath31 easily yields that the resulting x - ray luminosity should scale as @xmath32    however , this simple picture is challenged  especially at the scales from poor clusters to groups of galaxies  by several recent x - ray observations .",
    "first , the observed shape of the @xmath5 correlation departs from @xmath33 and bends down progressively in moving from very rich clusters down to poor groups ( see ponman et al .",
    "1996 ; helsdon & ponman 2000 ) , as if lower @xmath34 should imply considerably lower values of @xmath29 and thus much lower luminosities @xmath35 .",
    "second , the profiles of the x - ray surface brightness do not appear to be self - similar , rather they flatten out at low @xmath34 ( ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "third , the x - ray luminosity function @xmath36 shows little or no evidence of cosmological evolution ( rosati et al . 1998 ) ; if anything , weak negative evolution may affect the bright end of the lfs , but surely the data rule out the strong , positive `` density evolution '' that would prevail if the relation @xmath37 held and kept @xmath38 roughly constant .",
    "all that points toward an icm history more complex than pure , gravitational heating from infall into the forming dm potential wells , as already realized by kaiser ( 1991 ) .",
    "it rather suggests additional heating by injection of some non - gravitational energy , which ought to be more important for the shallower wells of the groups to the point of breaking there the simple assumption @xmath37 .    to single out the baryonic processes responsible for this , it is clearly useful ( see cavaliere 1980 , and bower 1997 ) to consider the icm specific entropy ( in boltzmann units ) @xmath39 , the one combination of @xmath34 and @xmath29 that is invariant under pure adiabatic compressions of the gas falling into the wells .",
    "data and n - body simulations ( lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon 1999 ) concur to show that in moving from clusters to groups this quantity is far from behaving in the way suggested by the self - similar scaling @xmath40 in fact , when the values averaged out to @xmath41 are plotted as a function of @xmath34 , they level off to a `` floor '' corresponding to @xmath42 kev @xmath43 . on the other hand , in clusters @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 increases",
    "outwards ( see lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon 1999 ) . these behaviours indicate that the entropy is enhanced in two ways relative to the self - similar scaling , both in the present groups and during the history of the clusters",
    ".      one promising explanation of all these observational features goes back to heating / ejection of the icm by thermal / mechanical feedback effects from star formation during the process of galaxy build up and clustering into groups ( cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1997 , 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 1998 ; valageas & silk 2000 ; fujita & takahara 2000 ) .",
    "we shall adopt as a baseline the injections of momentum and of thermal energy contributed both by stellar winds ( bressan , chiosi & fagotto 1994 ) and by type ii supernovae ( sn ) that follow the formation of massive stars in shallow wells .",
    "the latter include not only the current groups , but also the progenitors of current clusters ; in fact , the hierarchical clustering paradigm envisages such events to take place also during the early phase of a cluster s history when the progenitors were just groups , which subsequently grew by the progressive inclusion of additional mass lumps of comparable or smaller sizes .",
    "such combined feadback effects naturally imply the icm to be not only pre - heated to about @xmath46 kev , but also to be dynamically ejected outwards to the perifery of the dm haloes , at low densities @xmath47 @xmath23 .",
    "this is how a relatively high entropy level corresponding to @xmath48 kev @xmath43 may be attained in groups as well as in the central regions of the forming clusters . in the latter",
    ", the subsequent evolution will include adiabatic compression of the gas accreted along with the dm into the deepening wells ( tozzi & norman 2000 ) , a process that conserves entropy .",
    "but the gas falling supersonically into such deep potential wells will also pass through strong accretion shocks at about the virial radius @xmath8 , the process whereby the icm is actually heated to the current high temperatures of order @xmath49 . by the same token , much additional entropy is deposited in the outer regions , corresponding to shock conversion of the bulk inflows @xmath50 into thermal energy .",
    "this scenario leads one to expect in the groups not only lower densities , and much lower bremsstrahlung emission compared with the scaling @xmath51 , as observed ; but it also leads to expect little cosmological evolution for the population of bremsstrahlung emitters constituted by groups and clusters . this is because in the x - ray luminosity function @xmath36 the `` density evolution '' driven at medium - low @xmath35 by the hierarchical clustering is balanced by the lower luminosities corresponding to a steeper @xmath5 correlation .",
    "in fact , we have investigated and computed elsewhere in detail ( menci & cavaliere 2000 , hereafter mc2000 ; cavaliere , giacconi & menci 2000 , hereafter cgm2000 ) how the stellar feedbacks ( heating combined with ejection ) affect the icm and its x - ray emission @xmath52 , which is particularly sensitive to changes of the central icm density .      in the present paper",
    "we stress the _ complementary _ probe provided by the sz effect .",
    "the cmb modulation @xmath53 introduced in  1 provides another observable combination of @xmath34 and @xmath29 which depends on the thermal and on the mechanical feedback in a more balanced way .    in parallel with the scaling for @xmath35 provided by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the self - similar scaling for @xmath0 reads @xmath54 we shall investigate how the actual @xmath0 also _ departs _ away from @xmath55 due to @xmath56 and @xmath57 holding at groups scales , and shall discuss how the relative relative strength @xmath58 of the sz signal is related to entropy .",
    "our investigation will start with computations based upon specific semi - analytic modelling for the baryons in groups and clusters , in particular for those diffuse and hot constituting the icm .",
    "in the scenario outlined in  2.3 the processes responsible for the non - gravitational entropy floor in groups in clusters are just the same as those governing the formation history of stars and galaxies . at galactic scales",
    ", they tend to suppress the star formation in the earlier and shallower potential wells .",
    "the observable consequences include flattening of the local , optical lf function at faint - intermediate luminosities , and a decline of the integrated star formation rate for @xmath59 ; but the degree of such a decline sensitively depends on the feedback strength in the relevant wells .",
    "the picture has been quantitatively implemented in the so - called semi - analytic models for star and galaxy formation ( sams , see kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al . 1994",
    "; somerville & primack 1999 ) .",
    "these are built upon the notion of galaxies as baryonic cores located inside dm haloes ( white & rees 1978 ) ; they specify  though often in a phenomenological form  how the baryons are cycled among the condensed stellar phase , the cool gas phase and the hot gas phase , under the drive of the merging events that make up the hierarchical evolution of the dm haloes .",
    "since the very same dm and baryonic processes also play a key role in determining the state of the icm on scales larger than galactic , we take up the sam approach in its latest versions , and use it to evaluate the amount of non - gravitational heating of the icm and to predict the corresponding sz effect . our model is necessarly complex as it comprises several processes and many computational steps , so we outline its frame and workings in the form of a flow chart in fig . 1",
    ".      we base on an updated version of the sam originally presented in poli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this approach the average over the many possible merging histories of a given structure",
    "is performed by convolution over the merging probability functions given by lacey & cole ( 1993 ) and tested , e.g. , by cohn , bagla & white ( 2000 ) ; the average also includes the convolution with the probabilities for galaxy aggregations driven by dynamical friction inside common haloes . toward computing the stellar observables",
    ", the model treats the following processes .",
    "\\1 ) the dm haloes merge following the hierarchical clustering .",
    "the detailed merging histories are important for the problem at hands , since the gas carrying the non - gravitational entropy is pre - heated / expelled from condensations smaller than present - day systems , and is subsequently accreted by larger haloes .",
    "the time delays between heating / expulsion and accretion propagate up the structure hierarchy the aftermaths of the feedback .",
    "\\2 ) part of the hot gas mass @xmath60 diffused throughout the haloes cools down in all differently - sized potential wells , then condenses into stars on the timescale @xmath61 , see table 1 .",
    "the amount of cool gas is also controlled by the stellar feedback .",
    "this is because the condensation in stars of a mass @xmath62 eventually causes stellar winds and sn explosions to release a total non - gravitational energy @xmath63 ergs , where @xmath64 erg is the energy of a type ii sn explosion , @xmath65 is the efficiency in sne for the scalo imf .",
    "part of such energy is coupled to the gas and reheats an amount of cool gas @xmath66 ; in the sams this is often related to @xmath62 by the phenomenological assumption @xmath67 , with typical values for the fraction of reheated gas given by @xmath68 .",
    "the importance of the thermal effects of the feedback is expressed in terms of the above parametrization by the `` stellar '' temperature @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the fractional energy going directly into bulk motion of the material ; @xmath71 is to be compared with the virial temperature @xmath72 . in the way of a preliminary estimate , note that @xmath73 kev holds for a stellar baryonic fraction exceeding @xmath74 , the low value actually appropriate only for rich clusters . but",
    "@xmath75 kev is also the virial temperature corresponding to @xmath76 ; so in galaxies and in poor groups the stellar heating is expected to cause the gas to flow out of the wells . in the numerical model",
    "the process is evaluated in detail for all haloes .",
    "in fact , the scale dependence of the feedback is marked by the key parameter @xmath77 .",
    "to identify its relevant range consider the ratio between the work done in moving the gas out of the well and the actual bulk kinetic energy , given by @xmath78 .",
    "the proportionality constant turns out to be around @xmath79 for our fiducial values @xmath80 erg , @xmath81 ( with the contribution from stellar winds included after bressan et al .",
    "1994 ) and for @xmath82 ; so the reheated gas does escape from the relevant haloes with circular velocities @xmath83 when one takes @xmath84 , but it constitutes a fraction @xmath85 that decreases with increasing @xmath86 .    in the model development presented by mc2000 and cgm2000 we allowed this parameter to range from the extreme value @xmath87 adopted by other workers to our fiducial value @xmath88 .",
    "the former value ( hereafter case @xmath89 ) yields @xmath90 , which in the shallow early wells constitutes quite a _ strong _",
    "feedback , well over and above the escape energy barrier ; this leads to considerable depletion of the cool baryons and causes the star formation rate to decline sharply for @xmath91 .",
    "the latter value ( hereafter referred to as case @xmath92 ) instead yields a _ moderate _ and `` neutral '' feedback corresponding to @xmath93 const ; thus even the shallow , galactic haloes are allowed to retain considerable amounts of gas , and the resulting star formation rate is high and rather flat for @xmath94 .",
    "the values of this and of other relevant parameters are collected in table 1 .",
    "these lead to the b - band luminosity functions of the galaxies and to the cosmic star formation rate presented in mc2000 , when the critical universe dominated by standard cold dark matter is adopted . in the canonical @xmath95-dominated flat universe",
    "the same set of parameters leads to the results presented by poli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) together with the related galaxy sizes and tully - fisher relation , and discussed by cgm2000 .",
    "the sam used in the present paper includes also the processes relevant to the icm that have been developed and implemented in mc2000 and cgm2000 . in those papers",
    "the baryonic component condensed into stars has been used to normalize the model parameters to the optical observations , and the cool gas component has been presented for a final check with relevant data ; but our main focus was onto the _ hot _ gas identified with the icm , and onto its x - ray emission @xmath35 .",
    "the hot icm gives also rise to the sz effect of interest here , so the enumeration begun in  3.1 is continued next , to cover also the following processes relevant to the present scope .",
    "\\3 ) the accretion of external gas into the potential wells of groups and clusters sets the boundary condition for the internal gas disposition . to this aim ,",
    "we compute the density and temperature of groups and clusters at their virial radius @xmath8 .",
    "this is done in terms of the external temperature @xmath96 of the gas to be accreted during the merging histories of groups and clusters ; @xmath96 is set not only by the virial equilibrium inside the merging lumps but also by the feedback , and the more strongly so the closer to @xmath97 are the virial values .",
    "our computation comprises the following steps .",
    "first , we assume that the dm density @xmath98 inside the cluster has the form given by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) , and that the density @xmath99 external to the virial radius @xmath8 is related to the baryon density @xmath100 by @xmath101 .",
    "next , for a group or cluster of mass @xmath102 we compute the temperature @xmath96 of the external infalling gas .",
    "in particular , for each lump of mass @xmath103 accreted onto @xmath102 we consider two contributions : the fraction @xmath104 remains inside the potential well of @xmath103 at the virial temperature @xmath105 , while the fraction @xmath106 is ejected by the winds and the sne gone off within @xmath103 , and is heated to the temperature @xmath97 given by eq .",
    "last , we assume that the external gas is incorporated into the mass @xmath102 passing through a shock front at a position close to the virial radius @xmath8 .",
    "this is expected because the latter separates the region which is in hydrostatic equilibrium from the outer regions where the motion is dominated by infall ( see also bower et al .",
    "2000 ) , and so defines the transition from infall kinetic to thermal energy of the gas .",
    "shock positions close to @xmath8 are confirmed by many 1-d and 3-d n - body simulations ( e.g. , knight & ponman 1997 ; takizawa & mineshige 1998 ; pantano , gheller & moscardini 1998 ; governato et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation )",
    ".    then we compute the density @xmath107 and the temperature @xmath108 of the icm at the boundary @xmath8 of a group or cluster from the jump conditions at the shock ; these are derived from mass and momentum conservation across the shock ( the classic rankine - hugoniot conditions ) , and are expressed here in terms of the cluster potential @xmath109 at the boundary , and of the temperature of the incoming gas .",
    "the thermal energy @xmath110 associated with an accreted lump @xmath103 is contributed by the virialized component at @xmath111 and by the ejected component at @xmath112 , with their weigths @xmath113 and @xmath114 introduced above .",
    "thus , the weighted density jump @xmath115 at the shock in the icm of the considered group / cluster of mass @xmath102 is given by @xmath116 the density jump for either component has the form ( cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1999 ) @xmath117^{1/2}$ ] in terms of variable @xmath118 or @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the full expression for @xmath108 is given by the same authors ( see their eq .",
    "8) , but for strong shocks it reads simply @xmath120 in the approximation of small bulk kinetic energies downstream .",
    "note that for given @xmath103 the weighted jump @xmath121 increases with @xmath102 , but saturates to the value 4 when @xmath122 , that is , for strong shocks .    for a cluster or group of mass @xmath102 we obtain the _ average _ values of the weighted density jump and of the boundary temperature @xmath108 by integrating over the merging histories ; that is , we sum over all accreted lumps @xmath103 with their relative merging probabilities by inserting the above expressions eqs .",
    "( 4 )  ( 6 ) in the semi - analytic context .",
    "this will introduce dispersion in the boundary conditions due to the intrinsic spread of the merging histories ; we recall ( cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1997 , 1999 ) that the scatter we predicted for the @xmath123 correlation agrees with the findings by markevitch ( 1998 ) and by allen & fabian ( 1998 ) .",
    "we have numerically checked that for weaker and weaker feedback the average of @xmath124 over the merging histories goes to a constant , so that the self - similar scaling @xmath125 is recovered as expected .",
    "\\4 ) the final process relevant to the icm is the hydrostatic equilibrium , from which we compute the internal gas density profile , given the above boundary conditions .",
    "the gas density run @xmath126 is related to the dm density profile @xmath98 in terms of the parameter @xmath127 , the ratio of the dm to the gas specific energy ( @xmath128 is the 1-d velocity dispersion of the dm at the boundary , related to @xmath109 ) .",
    "while in the case of isothermal icm and of constant @xmath129 the run is simply given by @xmath130 ( cavaliere & fusco femiano 1976 , jones & forman 1984 ) , here we use the expressions given by cavaliere , menci & tozzi ( 1999 ) for the potential of navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and for a polytropic , but nearly isothermal icm .",
    "is observed to be close to constant , we distinguish @xmath131 and @xmath34 ( the latter may be taken to be the emission - weighted temperature ) only when relevant . ]",
    "thus , for a mass @xmath102 at the redshift @xmath132 we compute the inner icm profiles @xmath133 and @xmath134 in terms of the normalized radius @xmath135 .",
    "this is achieved basically with no free parameters ( see  5 for a discussion ) since the profiles are defined in terms of the boundary conditions and of the depth of the dm potential wells . in particular , for rich clusters @xmath136 holds and the shocks are strong , so the expression of @xmath137 obtains simply on using the expression ( 6 ) for @xmath108 to obtain @xmath138 .",
    "on the other hand , for decreasing @xmath102 the value of @xmath137 decreases to attain values @xmath139 for small groups , which yield gas density profiles significantly shallower than in clusters in agreement with ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1999 ) .",
    "1 provides a representation and a summary of the processes and of the computational steps we use to set the boundary conditions and the internal structure of the icm .",
    "our assumptions and fiducial choices are discussed in  5 .",
    "we refer to our previous papers mc2000 and cgm2000 for added details and for the results concerning the x - ray observables . in short , these include : @xmath137 decreases and the relation @xmath5 bends down in moving toward systems of lower @xmath34 , while @xmath140 shows little or no cosmological evolution , all in good agreement with the observations .",
    "in addition , the counts of x - ray sources from the icm are predicted to be enhanced corresponding to high values of the star formation rate at @xmath141 .",
    "here we epitomize the effectiveness of our model by showing in fig .",
    "2 the central icm entropy as a function of the x - ray temperature @xmath34 .",
    "such entropy is given by the ratio @xmath142 and is computed on using the profiles discussed above . ultimately , these are determined by the global gravitational and by the feedback - induced energies associated with the gas in the infalling clumps .",
    "the result is compared with the data presented by ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1999 ) and by lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon ( 2000 ) .",
    "we recall that entropy is of special value as a state variable for the icm ; in fact , in conditions of long cooling times it keeps the archive - as it were - of the thermal events ( different from adiabatic compressions ) which are associated with the icm gravitational heating / compression and with the non - gravitational heating / ejection .",
    "here we focus on how we use the above model to compute the sz effect from the icm in groups and clusters .",

    "we add that the scatter we find in the @xmath1 relation is smaller than @xmath186 for all temperatures ; so even in our moderate feedback case @xmath92 the predicted _ trend _ of @xmath1 departs neatly from @xmath55 below a few kevs , and even upper bounds to @xmath0 may be of value .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot ( for both the scdm and the @xmath95cdm cosmology / cosmogony ) the predicted sz source counts , and in fig .",
    "6 we show also the contribution to the cosmic compton parameter from all virialized structures distributed along the line of sight .",
    "note that the difference bewteen the two feedback cases @xmath89 and @xmath92 ( solid lines and dashed lines , respectively ) is small for such integrated observables ( the curves corresponding to the self - similar case would closely overlap those relative to the moderate feedback case @xmath92 ) .",
    "this is because small and/or distant structures not filling a telescope beam contribute to these two observables with weights given by the system radius squared ( see eq .",
    "10 - 11 ) ; this circumstance underplays the contribution of the groups , the structures most sensitive to feedback effects . on the other hand ( see cavaliere , menci & setti 1991 ; bartlett & silk 1994 ) , this very feature makes @xmath187 suitable as a cosmogonical probe , since the contributions of the cosmogonical parameters like the amplitude @xmath188 of the spectrum of the initial dm perturbations override those from the state and evolution of the icm .",
    "similar results concerning @xmath2 from the virialized structures have been found by valageas & silk ( 1999 ) ( see also valageas & schaeffer 2000 ) .",
    "these authors add the contributions produced by the gas inside lower density structures and by truly intergalactic gas , which they find to depend sensitively on the heating model ; this is not unexpected from non - virialized gas that fills bigger volumes and can absorb larger energies .",
    "here we focus the basic features shared by a number of current models of the icm ( mc2000 , cgm2000 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 1998 ; valageas & silk 1999 ; bower et al .",
    "2000 ) , in order to discuss to what extent our predictions concerning the sz effect are robust .",
    "we first stress the basic blocks shared by such models .",
    "next we discuss our specific treatement of the boundary conditions in terms of shock jumps .",
    "then we discuss why the shocks are effective in amplifying the impact of non - gravitational energy injections .",
    "finally , we show how the departure of the @xmath1 relation from its gravitational counterpart is related to the corresponding departure of the @xmath5 relation ; the model - independent link is constituted by the entropy discharged by the injection of non - gravitational energy , but the actual size of such departures depends on the feedback strength .",
    "\\a ) part of the baryons are subtracted out of the hot phase by cooling and are locked in the stars formed , to be only in part recycled by stellar winds .",
    "this actually constitutes a minor negative contribution to the mass of the hot phase .",
    "\\b ) the energy fed back by the condensing baryons , either to fuel black holes at the galactic centers or to form massive stars followed by winds and sne , heats up a fraction of the intergalactic medium . in our model",
    "the energy injection is @xmath189 erg per solar mass of stars formed , the fraction is @xmath190 and the stellar heating temperatures are @xmath191 kev ; the net outcome is to produce in groups a central density @xmath47 @xmath23 , lower than in clusters .",
    "since such gas is recovered by larger haloes during later merging events ( with the delays described in  3.1 ) , the effects propagate a number of steps up the mass hierarchy , so that the @xmath5 relation departs away from @xmath192 at temperature considerably higher than @xmath79 kev .",
    "a corresponding feature is also present , e.g. , in the elaborate model used by bower et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; in their model , as well as in ours , the gas fraction inside the virial radius is lower in groups than in clusters .",
    "\\c ) equilibrium is re - established soon after minor and intermediate merging events , that is , over sound crossing times which are somewhat shorter than the structures dynamical times . in such conditions , the pressure gradient balances gravity and a @xmath137-model holds .",
    "\\d ) once equilibrium is assumed , a key role is played by the boundary conditions that set normalization and shape ( specifically , the values of @xmath137 ) of the icm density profiles .",
    "in particular , the pressure balance at the boundary @xmath193 clearly constitutes the key condition ; we add that such a balance is to include the ram pressure due to the bulk motion @xmath194 of the infalling gas out of equilibrium , to read @xmath195 in conditions with low bulk kinetic energy downstream .",
    "\\e ) since the icm state is observed to be close to isothermal ( @xmath34 may decrease out to @xmath8 hardly by a factor 2 , see nevalainen , markevitch , & forman 2000 ) a sharp boundary  that is , some sharp drop or discontinuity of @xmath34 and/or @xmath29  is to take place at @xmath193 , lest the thermal exceeds the integrated gravitational energy",
    ".    model - dependent features , which however affect to a lesser extent the profiles of the icm in virialized structure , include : the exact value of the polytropic index ( close to 1 anyway ) and the detailed form of the underlying dm potential ( see the discussion by cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1999 ) ; the parameters other than the feedback exponent @xmath77 that are introduced in the various sams only to tune the optical luminosity function and the tully - fisher relation for the galaxies ( cf .",
    "cole et al .",
    "1994 with cole et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is also widely agreed that shocks provide an effective coupling of the gravitational to the thermal energy in the icm .    in our picture ,",
    "we take up from the results of the simulations referred to in  3.2 the notion that _ external _ accretion shocks do establish a discontinuity at about @xmath193 , with low bulk velocities left downstream ; observational evidence of large scale shocks related to violent merging events is reported by roettiger , stone & mushotzky ( 1998 ) ; roettiger , burns & stone ( 1999 ) ; markevitch , sarazin & vikhlinin ( 1999 ) . across such shocks the above stress conservation combined with with mass conservation yields the classic rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for @xmath34 and @xmath29 . without further ado",
    "these produce a non - linear increase of @xmath196 from @xmath197 to @xmath198 as the infall flows become increasingly supersonic , that is , as @xmath199 increases .",
    "note that the merging events that yield the largest contributions to @xmath200 are the numerous ones ( more than 90% ) with minor partners having mass ratios smaller than @xmath201 , which may be appropriately described as constituting an `` accretion '' inflow of the dm component as well as of the baryonic component ( see raig , gonzalez - casado & salvador - sole 1998 ) .",
    "such minor events contribute the majority of the mass increase ( more than 50% ) , and imply lower temperatures @xmath202 kev ( whether of gravitational or of stellar origin ) for the external gas they involve , leading to more supersonic gas inflows .",
    "the summed action of these events is as close to isotropic as permitted by the surrounding large scale structure ( see tormen 1997 ; colberg et al .",
    "1999 ) ; re - establishing the equilibrium then is more like a continuous re - adjustement to the accretion inflow .    on the other hand ,",
    "given the external conditions the gas inflow is bound to be more supersonic on average when it takes place into the deeper wells provided by the richer clusters where @xmath203 km s@xmath15 is attained ; this leads to expect larger entropy depositions in the outer regions of rich clusters , as in fact observed ( lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon 1999 ) . in poor groups , instead , where the stellar heating temperatures match the virial ones to give @xmath204 kev , the shocks degenerate into sonic , adiabatic transitions ; here all internal densities scale down proportionally to @xmath205 , so @xmath206 is bound to plunge down toward @xmath207 .",
    "to see how the departures from the self - similar scalings begin and end , one can make use of two opposite approximations , rather crude but simple : when the pre - shock temperature @xmath96 is low , the strong shock approximation yields @xmath208 , see eq .",
    "( 6 ) ; on the other hand , the lower bound to all temperatures is constituted by @xmath97 . for decreasing depths of the wells",
    "these approximations show that the decline of @xmath209 begins slowly , then becomes faster like @xmath210 in shallow wells ; this implies correspondingly flatter density profiles . similarly but more strongly",
    ", @xmath211 departs from @xmath212 slowly at first in deep wells , but eventually plunges toward @xmath213 in shallow wells .",
    "a final remark concerns the normalization of the compton parameter @xmath0 related to the shock condition . in our model , the boundary values for the density and the temperature",
    "are fixed by the shock jumps in terms of the external density @xmath99 and of the gravitational potential @xmath109 at @xmath214 ( see eq . 7 ) .",
    "now , @xmath215 holds , while @xmath109 depends both on the shape of the gravitational potential and on the location of the boundary at @xmath216 . for our fiducial choice of @xmath217 and of the navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) potential , our shock or boundary location ( supported by the n - body simulations referred to in  3.2 ) leads to a normalization of the @xmath0 parameter in agreement with the observed values ; for example , for a coma - like cluster with @xmath218 kev , we obtain @xmath219 , closely independent of the feedback , see fig .",
    "4 ; this is in good agreement with the measured value , see herbig et al .",
    "the same normalization can be obtained on changing the value of @xmath100 in the range @xmath220 allowed by the canonical primordial nucleosynthesis , and on retaining the same dm potential but readjusting the shock position within the range @xmath221 compatible with the n - body simulations .",
    "it is intrinsic to the present model that the departures from the gravitational scaling are non - linearly _ amplified _ , due to the varying shock strengths set by the depth @xmath222 of the potential wells compared with @xmath223 . for a given departure , such an amplification _ lowers _ the requirements for the non - gravitational energy injection .",
    "indeed , the excess central entropy @xmath224 observed in groups over the self - similar expectations ( see fig .",
    "2 ) can be obtained with a moderate energy injection @xmath225 leading to @xmath226 with @xmath227 kev , provided the central density at the group scale is decreased relative to clusters by a factor around @xmath228 . in our model",
    "such a decrement results in part from the boundary density jump ( lower than in clusters by a factor 4 ) , and in part from the shallow gas density profile due to the lower values of @xmath137 ( about half than in clusters ) .",
    "thus , the presence of shock amplification allows us to consider _ conservative _ quantities for the feedback , namely , energy contributed by stellar winds plus by sn explosions adding up to @xmath229 erg per @xmath230 of stars formed .",
    "note also that the two contributions are largely separated and undergo different amounts of cooling , lesser ( if anything ) for the winds .",
    "stellar winds and amplification go a couple of steps toward meeting the concerns about prompt radiative cooling of the sn outputs which may limit the fraction available for action at galactic or group scales . as is well known , the issue is a thorny and debated one . on the one hand stands the intrinsic sensitivity of the cooling to density clumpiness ( see , e.g. , thornton et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand , momentum and thermal energy",
    "are carried outward of the sites of star formation in the form of blast waves and shocks , in fact as sn remnants .",
    "it is widely agreed ( see ostriker & mckee 1988 ) that these may easily overlap before they enter a strong radiative phase , especially when they are driven by type ii sne produced by correlated massive star formation , and when they are helped by the tunnel network in the ism .",
    "so they merge their hot and thin interiors , break out of the galaxies in the form of superbubbles , and discharge their high entropy content into the galaxian outskirts ; this is then mixed throughout the icm .",
    "additional sources of non - gravitational heating may be provided by active galactic nuclei shining at the center of developing galaxies ( see wu , fabian & nulsen 1999 ; valageas & silk 1999 ; aghanim , balland & silk 2000 ) . the agns are fed at sub - pc scales by accreting black holes ; their outputs are huge , but the effective coupling within galaxies or groups of such energy to the icm within galaxies or groups is even more uncertain than for the sne . such coupling would require quite some tuning to yield just the observed @xmath5 correlation ( p. madau , private communication ) ; the intrinsic instability of the cooling may easily drown any correlation into a large intrinsic scatter . treating such processes in full",
    "is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be undertaken elsewhere .      as can be noted from figs .",
    "3 and 4 , the departure from self - similarity we find from our model in the @xmath1 relation for groups and clusters features an _",
    "@xmath0-dependence on the strength of the feedback , which sets in below @xmath231 kev .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that of the @xmath5 relation for groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the correspondence is explained by the model - independent relation which follows from combining the definitions of @xmath232 and of the compton parameter @xmath0 with its self - similar scaling given by by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , to read @xmath233 we recall from  5 that @xmath34 exceeds @xmath49 due to the non - gravitational heating , and the excess becomes more and more relevant in moving from rich clusters to poor groups .",
    "the above eq .",
    "shows than that an internal heating source rising the entropy content will result in lower values of @xmath0 compared to the self - similar expectations at the scale of groups .",
    "the counterpart of eq .",
    "( 12 ) for the x - ray emission reads @xmath234 again model - independently . assuming the two observables are associated ( albeit with different shape factors ) with icm confined within comparable sizes , the two equations combine to yield @xmath235    the above equations highlight in a _ model - independent _ way the inverse nature of both the @xmath236 and the @xmath237 relations .",
    "so the entropy excess observed in groups of galaxies implies a related deficit of _ both _ the x - ray luminosity as indeed is found in the observed @xmath5 correlation , and of the sz effect as here predicted . in both cases",
    "the dependence on the temperature is instead direct , and actually stronger in the @xmath236 relation .",
    "the point to emphasize is that these two probes are _ independent _ observationally ; in fact , they are measured in such distant bands as x - rays and microwaves , with very different instrumentations subject to different systematics .",
    "in addition , the sz effect can be measured also at sub - mm wavelengths , which provide a positive @xmath238 with systematics different yet .",
    "finally , the selections are intrisically different in the @xmath4w / sub - mm and in the x - ray bands , with the sz signal being much _ less _ sensitive than the x - ray emission to internal density clumpiness or enhancements .",
    "thus , while either observable may be subject to its own observational biases , background subtraction or scatter ( see mahdavi et al .",
    "1997 ; roussel , sadat & blanchard 2000 ) , the _ combined _ evidence will be highly significant and strongly constraining for the non - gravitational heating mechanisms .",
    "in this paper we have computed and presented three observables related to the sz effect from the icm in groups and clusters of galaxies , namely , the @xmath1 correlation , the source counts and the contribution to the cosmic sz effect .",
    "we based our computations on the specific semi - analytic model ( sam ) described in  3 ; this is built upon the hierachical merging histories of the dm component of such structures , and provides stellar and x - ray observables in agreement with the data .",
    "the picture underlying our sam is widely shared , and its main blocks are common ( as discussed in  5 ) to other sams also aimed at explaining the optical and x - ray observations .    one key feature is the energy and momentum fed back into the icm by the condensing baryons .",
    "this has the effect of pre - heating the baryons that fall into groups and clusters during their merging history .",
    "the shock front forming between the infalling and the internal gas amplifies the effect of the non - gravitational heating on the density distribution of the gas in a way which depends on the cluster or group temperature @xmath34 .",
    "the net effect is to break the ( approximate ) scale - invariance of the dm quantities in _ virialized _",
    "structures , particulary in galaxy groups with @xmath239 kev compared to rich clusters .",
    "the effect of such processes on the x - ray properties of groups and clusters has been investigated in our previous papers ; here we have shown that the sz effect constitutes a _ complementary _ probe of the non - gravitational heating of icm .",
    "in particular we emphasize the following results .",
    "@xmath240 the measure of the compton parameter @xmath0 from deep , targeted observations of groups and clusters and the resulting @xmath1 correlation provide a direct probe of the energy discharged into the icm and archived there in conditions of long cooling times . specifically , for energy injections dumped into the icm within galaxies or groups we predict the @xmath1 correlation to bend down systematically relative to the self - similar expectations ( see  4 , figs . 3 - 4 ) .",
    "in  5 we discuss the generic aspects of the _ trend _ : larger injection - smaller @xmath0 at group scales , that we expect from any reasonably complete model",
    ". the level of such departures will be similar to ours for feedback models able to reproduce the bent shape of the @xmath5 relation in x - rays .",
    "this conclusion is substantiated by eqs .",
    "( 12)-(14 ) which show _ model - independently _ that heating sources rising the internal entropy in groups to the observed `` floor '' will result in observably low values of @xmath0 compared to the self - similar expectations .",
    "@xmath240 the integrated sz effects from structures ( i.e. , the counts @xmath241 of sz sources associated with virialized structures and their contribution @xmath2 to cosmic sz effect ( see figs . 5 - 6 ) are dominated by clusters less affected by the feedback , even less by its details .",
    "to conclude , the emerging picture is one where the close scale - invariance of the _ gravitational _ energy released over large scales under the drive of the dm dynamics is broken by the _ nuclear _ energy that at small scales drives the stellar life and death ; the break - even point should occur at the transitional mass scale @xmath242 where @xmath243 kev holds .",
    "the specific way in which baryons break the dm scale - invariance can be probed with several _ complementary _ but observationally _ independent _ observables which include : the bent x - ray luminosity - temperature correlation ; the weak or absent evolution of the x - ray luminosity functions ; excess counts of the icm x - ray sources correlated with high rates of cosmic star formation at @xmath244 ; the shape and evolution of the optical luminosity function of the galaxies ; finally , the sz effect as proposed here , and in particular the bent @xmath1 relation from clusters to groups .",

    "<S> we investigate how strongly and at what scales the sunyaev - zeldovich effect reflects the shifting balance between two processes that compete for governing the density and the thermodynamic state of the hot intra - cluster medium pervading clusters and groups of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> one such process is the hierarchical clustering of the dm ; this induces gravitational heating of the diffuse baryons , and strives to push not only the galaxy systems but also the icm they contain toward self - similarity . away from </S>",
    "<S> it drives the other process , constituted by non - gravitational energy fed back into the icm by the condensing baryons . </S>",
    "<S> we base on a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and clustering to describe how the baryons are partitioned among the hot , the cool and the stellar phase ; the partition shifts as the galaxies cluster hierarchically , and as feedback processes ( here we focus on stellar winds and supernova explosions ) follow the star formation . </S>",
    "<S> such processes provide a moderate feedback , whose impact is amplified by the same large scale accretion shocks that thermalize the gravitational energy of gas falling into the growing potential wells . </S>",
    "<S> we use the model to compute the compton parameter @xmath0 that governs the amplitude of the sz effect , and to predict how this is affected by the feedback ; for individual clusters and groups we find a relation of @xmath0 with the icm temperature , the @xmath1 relation , which departs from the form suggested by the self - similar scaling , and bends down at temperatures typical of galaxy groups . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the average @xmath2 and the source counts as a function of @xmath0 under different assumptions concerning feedback strength and cosmology / cosmogony . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss to what extent our results are generic of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation and clustering ; we show how the @xmath3 relation , to be measured at @xmath4wave or sub - mm wavelengths , is model - independently related to the shape of the @xmath5 correlation measured in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that these observables together  because of their complementarity and their observational independence  can firmly bound the processes responsible for non - gravitational entropy injections into the icm . </S>"
