    "blazars can be classified also by the shape of their overall sed , as  red \" or ",
    "blue \" objects whether the peak of the synchrotron emission ( in a @xmath0 representation ) lies in the ir  optical or uv  soft - x band , respectively . in the x  ray band",
    "this distinction becomes quite apparent , since  red \" objects show a flat ( @xmath1 ) inverse compton spectrum , while  blue \" objects show a steep ( @xmath2 ) spectrum , due to the tail of the synchrotron emission .",
    "it was believed that fsrqs showed exclusively  red \" properties , while bllacs were found with either  red \" ( lbls , mainly radio selected ) or  blue \" properties ( hbls , mainly x  ray selected ) . recently however , new surveys like the dxrbs ( perlman et al .",
    "1998 ) , the rgb ( laurent  muehleisen et al . 1998 ) and the rex ( caccianiga et al . 1999 ) are revealing a more complete scenario , thanks to the covering of regions of the parameters space previously unexplored ( in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and broad band spectral indices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . among fsrqs",
    ", they have discovered a new type of objects , with broad band spectral indices very similar to hbls , which qualify them as  blue quasar \" candidates , the missing counterpart in a possible fsrq  bl lac simmetric scenario ( further details and the _ beppo_sax discover of the first  blue \" fsrq in padovani et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) . among bllacs",
    ", these surveys are showing that they actually form a continuous class with respect to the peak of the synchrotron emission , which smoothly ranges between ir and soft  x frequencies ( and up to the 210 kev band for some  extreme \" sources like mkn 421 ) .",
    "another interesting question is if there exists a limit at the blue end of the sequence .",
    "in fact , the _ beppo_sax observations of mkn 501 ( pian et al . 1997 ) and 1es 2344 + 514 ( giommi et al .",
    "1997 ) have revealed that , at least in a flaring state , the synchrotron peak can reach even higher energies , around or above 100 kev . in these cases the x  ray slope in the 110 kev band is _ flat _ even if the radiation process is synchrotron .",
    "here we report on the _ beppo_sax observing campaign performed with the aim of finding and studying other sources as  extreme \" as mkn 501 in flaring state ."
