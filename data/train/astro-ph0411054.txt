    "the bright southern star @xmath0 centauri ( hr 5267 ) is classed in the _ bright star catalogue _ @xcite as spectral type b1iii , and as a visual double of separation 13 with a magnitude difference of 3.2 . in 1963 , during the early commissioning observations with the narrabri stellar intensity interferometer ( nsii ) @xcite , it was found that the instrument s response to @xmath0 cen was approximately half that expected from a single star . from this observation",
    "it was deduced that the primary of the visual double was in fact a binary system with two roughly equal components @xcite .",
    "it was not possible to determine additional information about @xmath0 cen with the nsii , but support for the binary nature of the primary came from the spectroscopic observations of breger , shobbrook and robertson , and lomb .",
    "they found that the primary probably contained a @xmath0 cephei variable with period of either 0.135d or 0.157d , and that residual velocities for the lines are consistent with a binary which shobbrook and robertson suggested had a period of 352d .",
    "the spectroscopic observations led to @xmath0 cen being classified as a single - lined spectroscopic binary but robertson et al .",
    "have used aperture masking interferometry and high resolution spectroscopy to confirm that the primary is indeed a binary , to resolve the angular separation of the two components , and to establish it as a double - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "ausseloos et al .",
    "have made a detailed spectroscopic study of @xmath0 cen and shown that it is an eccentric binary with two @xmath0 cep - type components and determined the orbital parameters of the system .    in this paper",
    "we report observations of the @xmath0 cen system made with the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) @xcite which not only confirm the detection of the two components of the primary reported by robertson et al . but also enable the orbital parameters of the system to be determined . in this paper ` @xmath0 cen ' will be taken to identify the spectroscopic binary alone unless the fainter visual companion is specifically mentioned .",
    "we also report an update of the spectroscopic study of @xmath0 cen by ausseloos et al . and combine the interferometric and spectroscopic results to determine the distance to the system and the masses and absolute magnitudes of the components .",
    "susi is a long baseline optical stellar interferometer with a north - south baseline array .",
    "it measures the square of the fringe visibility which we term the ` correlation ' @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the correlation for a binary star is given by    @xmath10 \\label{eq : cor}\\ ] ]    where @xmath0 is the brightness ratio of the two components ( defined so that @xmath11 ) and    @xmath12    the symbols in equations  ( [ eq : theta1 ] ) and ( [ eq : theta2 ] ) are defined as follows : @xmath13 is the length of the interferometer baseline projected onto the sky , @xmath14 is the observing wavelength , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the equivalent uniform - disk angular diameters of the primary and secondary components , and @xmath17 is a bessel function . in equation  ( [ eq : costerm ] )",
    "@xmath18 is the angular separation of the two components and @xmath19 is the angle between the line joining the two stars and the projection of the baseline onto the sky .",
    "the rotation of the earth causes both @xmath13 and @xmath19 to vary with time .",
    "@xmath19 will also vary due to orbital motion of the binary system .",
    "the result of these variations is to cause the cosine term in equation  ( [ eq : cor ] ) , and hence the observed correlation , to vary with hour angle .",
    "the timescale of the variation in correlation depends on the baseline employed and , for each observing night , the baseline was chosen to give at least one , and preferably two minima in the observed correlation .    in order to obtain accurate measurements of the correlation it it essential to ensure that any difference in optical path length @xmath20opl between the two arms of the interferometer is small compared with the coherence length of the interferometer . in susi",
    "this is done by means of an optical path length compensator ( oplc ) @xcite .",
    "ideally an automatic fringe tracker would be used to control the oplc and maintain path equality but , at the time of the observations reported here , this was not available and the following technique was employed .",
    "the correlation was measured for several values of the optical path difference between the two arms of the interferometer bracketing the matched path position .",
    "the correlation at @xmath20opl = 0 was found by fitting a ` delay ' curve to the data @xcite .",
    "a series of delay curves was obtained for each night to give a time series of correlation values for @xmath20opl = 0 .",
    "the usual mode of operation for interferometric observations is to interleave observations of the programme star or binary system with observations of calibrators , stars that are either unresolved or of known angular diameter .",
    "the limiting magnitude of susi at the time of the observations was b @xmath21 2.5 and there were no suitable calibrators in the vicinity of @xmath0 cen . the observed correlation from @xmath0  cen was generally changing rapidly due to the cosine term in equation  ( [ eq : cor ] ) and it was desirable to monitor it as continuously as possible . in the absence of suitable calibrators and the lack of a fringe - tracking system",
    "it was decided to omit observations of calibration sources and , instead of endeavouring to measure the angular sizes of the components as well , to concentrate on the determination of the orbital elements of the system .",
    "this omission adds some complication to the analysis but has minimal implications for the determination of the separations and position angles of the component stars . with these considerations in mind ,",
    "the observations were made at a wavelength of 442 nm and with baseline lengths of 5 m , 10 m , 15 m , 20 m or 40 m . at these baselines",
    "the two component stars of the system are only partially resolved and the correlation for either of the components alone is estimated to be @xmath22 for all the baselines except 40 m where the correlation is estimated to be @xmath230.8 ( see section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "a total of 43 nights of observations of @xmath0  cen were made with susi during the period april 1997 to april 2002 .",
    "the dates of the observations and the baselines used are listed in table  [ tab : vectors ] .    [ cols=\">,^,>,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]",
    "the orbital parameters for the primary component of @xmath0 cen have been determined from interferometric observations made with susi .",
    "these parameters have been combined with the high resolution double - lined spectroscopic data for @xmath0  cen reported in ausseloos et al . , the analysis of which has been revised here .",
    "the combination of data has yielded the masses and absolute visual magnitudes of the component stars and an accurate distance to the system .",
    "the very precise results of this powerful combination of techniques are summarised in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the results presented in this paper constitute a very suitable starting point for any future asteroseismic modelling of @xmath24cen s two pulsating components .",
    "the star is also an ideal target to investigate possible tidal effects on the oscillations in view of the very close passage ( less than 10 times the radii of the component stars ) of the stars at periastron although , for this , long - term monitoring over several orbits is required .",
    "the susi programme has been funded jointly by the australian research council and the university of sydney , with additional support from the pollock memorial fund and the science foundation for physics within the university of sydney .",
    "the authors are grateful to bill hartkopf for making the binary orbit fitting program available to us and for assistance with its implementation .",
