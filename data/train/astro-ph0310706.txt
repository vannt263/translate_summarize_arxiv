    "establishing the statistical character of the cmb fluctuations is one of the most fundamental problems in cosmology .",
    "the simplest inflationary theories predict gaussian fluctuations whereas non - standard inflation and topological defects predict different non - gaussian ones .",
    "recent sensitive cmb observations ( boomerang , maxima , dasi , wmap ) have shown no evidence of departures from gaussianity up to date . this fact has put strong constraints on the amount of cosmic strings in the universe and on the non - linear coupling parameter in the case of a quadratic potential ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "there is not a unique way to search for non - gaussianity in the cmb .",
    "different features will be best probed by methods which are well adapted to point them .",
    "the methods can work in real space and also in fourier , wavelet or other spaces in which the non - gaussian features can be more enhanced . in this work",
    "we will focus on two powerful methods to search for non - gaussianity : one based on spherical wavelets and the other on smooth goodness - of - fit tests .",
    "only two spherical wavelet families have been considered in cmb analyses : haar and mexican hat . some of their properties as well as their potentiality to test the normality will be discussed .",
    "the smooth tests of goodness - of - fit have been shown to be very powerful in testing the gaussianity of data in many fields outside the cmb .",
    "we here introduce the tests in the cmb context and explain how they can be applied in a satisfactory way .",
    "we will first consider the univariate case , already introduced in cayn et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , and later the multivariate one .",
    "the problematics concerning their application to the cmb sky will be discussed .",
    "we will also review some recent results obtained by applying the previous methods to different experiments like cobe - dmr and maxima .",
    "although several works have already been performed using planar wavelets to analyse the cmb temperature fluctuations in small patches of the sky , it is clear that a proper analysis of any area of the sky will involve spherical wavelets .",
    "the latter have been developed recently .",
    "schrder and sweldens ( 1995 ) introduced the spherical haar wavelets ( shw ) as a generalization of the planar ones to the pixelised sphere .",
    "they are orthogonal and adapted to a given pixelization of the sky which must be hierarchical .",
    "two applications of the spherical haar wavelets have already been performed to analyse cmb maps .",
    "tenorio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) applied them to a quadcube pixelization of the cmb sky for which a correction of the pixel area has to be made .",
    "barreiro et al . ( 2000 ) tested the gaussianity of the cobe - dmr data on the healpix equal - area pixelation for which no correction is required .",
    "they found cobe - dmr data consistent with gaussianity .",
    "an extension of isotropic wavelets to the sphere has been proposed by antoine and vandergheynst ( 1998 ) following a group theory approach .",
    "it is based on the stereographic projection which translates from the plane to the sphere the following four basic properties : compensation , translation , dilation and the euclidean limit for small angles .",
    "the spherical mexican hat wavelets ( smhw ) are a particular case of isotropic wavelets which can thus be constructed by a stereographic projection of the planar mexican hat ones ( martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "cayn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) tested the gaussianity of the cobe - dmr data on the healpix pixelation using the skewness and kurtosis of the smhw cofficients at different angular scales and also the correlations at different scales .",
    "no deviation from gaussianity was detected .",
    "a comparative analysis of the performance of the two spherical wavelet families , shw and smhw , already proposed in the literature to analyse the cmb statistical distribution has been performed by martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "the comparison was based on the power to discriminate between standard inflationary models ( gaussian ) and non - gaussian models , the latter consisting in small deviations of the gaussian inflationary models introducing an artificially specified skewness or kurtosis through the edgeworth expansion .",
    "the skewness or kurtosis present at different wavelet scales was included by a linear optimal combination using the fisher discriminant .",
    "the result of this analysis is that the smhw is much more sensitive to these low - order cumulants than the shw and it is therefore preferred for the detection of this type of non - gaussianity .",
    "more recently , the nonlinear coupling parameter @xmath0 in the case of a quadratic term for the gravitational potential has been constrained with the cobe - dmr data ( cayn et al .",
    "the result , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 confidence level ) represents the strongest constraint obtained with those data .",
    "in this section , the _ score _ statistic is presented . this statistic is the starting point to construct the rayner and best test ( rayner and best 1989 , 1990 ) , which is used in the present work to test the univariate and multivariate gaussian distributions .",
    "given a statistical variable @xmath3 and @xmath4 independent realizations @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , we want to test if the probability density function of @xmath3 is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "this statistical variable can be a real @xmath8-dimensional vector and , thus , the method can test , for example , if @xmath9 is a multivariate normal distribution ( this is one of the cases we are interested in ) .",
    "smooth tests are constructed to discriminate between the predetermined function @xmath7 and a second one that deviates smoothly from the former .",
    "we consider an alternative probability density function @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is a parameter vector ) that deviates smoothly from @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , we want to test the _ null hypothesis _ : @xmath13 .",
    "the probability density of @xmath4 independent realizations @xmath5 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "given these measurements we calculate the estimated value of @xmath11 by means of the _ maximum likelihood method_. we denote this value by @xmath15 .",
    "we define @xmath16 such that @xmath17    let @xmath18 be a vector whose components are @xmath19 , where the log  likelihood is defined as @xmath20 .",
    "assuming @xmath15 close to @xmath21 , we expand @xmath16 and @xmath22 in taylor series around @xmath15 , and we have    @xmath23    this quantity is a direct measurement of the diference between @xmath15 and @xmath21 and therefore a test of the null hypothesis . we construct a quantity closely related to the last one . to construct this quantity we substitute @xmath24 for its mean value    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is a matrix of components @xmath27 and",
    "it can be shown that it is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the approximation of @xmath29 by its mean value is valid when @xmath4 is large , where the last equality holds because @xmath30 is the same statistical variable for all @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , the last mean value can be approximated by @xmath32 , and then , @xmath33 when @xmath34 . ] .",
    "the @xmath35 quantity is the so  called _ score _ statistic .",
    "a wider description of the previous development can be found in cox and hinkley ( 1974 ) .",
    "let us suppose that we have a statistical variable which takes values in the real domain .",
    "in the work of rayner and best ( 1989,1990 ) it is defined an alternative probability density function of orden @xmath36 given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a normalization constant and the @xmath39 functions are orthonormal on @xmath9 with @xmath40 . then , the score statistic associated to the @xmath36 alternative is given by    @xmath41    when we want to test if @xmath9 is a gaussian function of zero mean and unit variance , the @xmath39 functions become the normalized hermite  chebishev polynomials , that is , they are equal to @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and for @xmath46 : @xmath47 .",
    "every alternative function , that is , every @xmath36 value , gives a statistic @xmath48 .",
    "the statistics @xmath48 are given by : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 - 6 [ \\hat{\\mu}_2 -1 ] ) ^2   /24 $ ] and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the statistic @xmath48 is related to cumulants of order @xmath55 , and then this test is directional , that is , it indicates how the actual distribution deviates from gaussianity .",
    "for example , if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are small and @xmath58 is large , then the data have a large @xmath59 value and also have a large skewness value because of the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath34 , the @xmath48 statistic is distributed as a @xmath60 .",
    "this holds because @xmath61 is gaussian distributed when @xmath34 ( sum of a large number of independent variables ) .    in the case of the cmb ,",
    "the data are correlated and therefore not independent .",
    "let @xmath62 be the value of the pixel @xmath63 .",
    "if we perform the cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix of the data : @xmath64 , and change to the variable @xmath65 , then these new data are uncorrelated with zero mean and unity deviation and then , if gaussianity holds , they are independent with a @xmath66 distribution",
    ". then we work with these data and apply to them the test here described .    in cayn",
    "et al . ( 2003b ) , the power of these statistics is studied and the method is used to test the gaussianity of the data of the maxima experiment ( balbi et al .",
    "2000 , hanany et al .",
    "the analysis finds these data compatible with gaussianity under these goodness - of - fit tests .",
    "these statistics are also used in aliaga et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to constrain the skewness and kurtosis of the mentioned data . in this work",
    "the skewness @xmath35 and the kurtosis @xmath67 are constrained to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , at 99% confidence level .      in this case",
    ", the statistical variable @xmath3 takes values in a @xmath8-dimensional vectorial space and we want to test if @xmath7 is a multinormal distribution of mean equal to @xmath70 and correlation matrix equal to @xmath71 . for the sake of clarity we are going to change the notation of the vectorial quantities @xmath3 and @xmath70 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 . as it happened in the previous subsection",
    ", we need a set of orthonormal functions on @xmath9 .",
    "rayner and best ( 1989 ) propose the following construction : the cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix is performed : @xmath74 and the matrix @xmath75 is obtained .",
    "thus , one constructs the new variables : @xmath76 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the functions @xmath77 are orthonormal on @xmath78 , where the @xmath79 function is the normalized hermite - chebishev polynomial of degree @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the @xmath83 component of the @xmath84 vector .",
    "the degree of the @xmath85 function is equal to @xmath86 .    in the case of the rayner - best test",
    "applied to the univariate gaussian distribution , the @xmath39 functions are ordered by its degree @xmath63 . in that case",
    "the ordering is easy to establish , but in the case of the multivariate gaussian , different @xmath85 functions can have the same degree .",
    "thus , suppose some ordering has been imposed , such that the degree @xmath83 functions are considered before the degree r+1 ones .",
    "call this ordered system @xmath87 , where @xmath80 is the position in the ordering and @xmath83 indicates the degree of the function .",
    "it holds that the number of functions of degree @xmath83 is the combinatorial number @xmath88 .    to calculate the @xmath48 statistic ,",
    "we start from an alternative distribution like the one shown in the expresion ( [ eq:001 ] ) , but the @xmath89 functions are substituted by the @xmath90 ones .",
    "the order of the alternative function , that is , the index @xmath36 of @xmath48 represents the number of functions @xmath90 used .",
    "if we use functions up to degree @xmath83 , then @xmath91 . in an analogous way to the univariate case , the @xmath48 is given by    @xmath92    it is interesting to construct quantities like the @xmath93 ones of the expresion ( [ eq:002 ] ) which have a defined degree and their addition gives the @xmath48 statistic . to do this , in the sum of the @xmath94 terms in ( [ eq:003 ] ) one separates and groups the terms which have the same degree , and then , if we go up to degree @xmath83 :    @xmath95 ^ 2\\ ] ]    in the previous expresion , for every @xmath96 , the sum on the @xmath63 index is made over all the functions of degree equal to @xmath80 and so @xmath96 is a quantity of degree @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath97 vector is the sample @xmath31 of our experiment . when @xmath34 , @xmath98 is gaussian distributed ( with zero mean and unit variance ) because of the central limit theorem applied to the independent @xmath99 samples .",
    "thus @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "if we calculate the @xmath48 statistics , or the @xmath96 quantities , as it is shown in equation ( [ eq:004 ] ) , it is not important the order we have imposed to the @xmath103 functions , the only important aspect is how many functions of degree @xmath80 are there . if we know these functions we only have to add them to construct @xmath96 .    in the appendix ,",
    "the @xmath96 quantities are given , for @xmath104 , and their distributions are shown in figure [ disu2 ] .",
    "these distributions are calculated with 5000 realizations where one realization consists of @xmath105 3-dimensional vectors ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "then , as @xmath4 is very large , we see that the shown distributions are very close to the asymptotic distributions , that is , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in the table",
    "[ tab1 ] , the values of the mean and standard deviation ( @xmath111 ) of the @xmath96 distributions are shown .",
    "these values are compared with the values of the corresponding asymptotic distributions @xmath112 .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath58 and @xmath113 statistics are shown in the figure [ dis_s ] .",
    "for @xmath58 the obtained mean value is 18.961 and the standard deviation 6.259 . for @xmath113",
    "the same quantities are 33.932 and 8.534 . in the asymptotic case @xmath114 ( with mean value 19 and standard deviation 6.164 ) and @xmath115 ( with mean value 34 and standard deviation 8.246 ) .    as an example",
    ", we calculate the distributions of the statistics when the @xmath116 are uniformly distributed with mean zero and standard deviation equal to one .",
    "the first moment of this distribution which is different from the moments of the gaussian distribution is the kurtosis , that is , the moment of degree four .",
    "so , the distribution for the statistic @xmath117 must be different ( see equation ( [ eq:006 ] ) ) when we compare the uniform case with the gaussian one .",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation of @xmath96 distributions are shown in table [ tab2 ] , and in fact , we see that we can discriminate between a gaussian distribution and a uniform distribution ( in this case with @xmath106 ) , because the distributions of @xmath117 are very different .",
    "also the distributions of @xmath118 are different enough for discrimination in this case .",
    "finally , the question is how to apply this test when we have only one map of cmb .",
    "we need a large number of samples @xmath4 to estimate the sums from @xmath119 to @xmath4 that we have in expressions ( [ eq:005 ] ) to ( [ eq:006 ] ) , that is , given the initial map we need to extract independent samples . one way to obtain them",
    "is : first , to define the dimension @xmath8 of the multinormality we want to test and then divide the cmb map in patches of @xmath8 pixels distributed in the same way within each path ; second , to try to decorrelate them .",
    "assuming that all the data are multinormal then the patches can be considered as independent samples after decorrelation . in this way we can apply the method described above , work is in progress to apply it to wmap .    _",
