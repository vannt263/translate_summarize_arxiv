    "higher data rates , large bandwidth , and higher spectral efficiency are necessary for the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) wireless communication systems to support various emerging applications @xcite . the combination of millimeter wave ( mmwave ) communication @xcite with massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) @xcite is considered as one of the promising candidate technologies for 5 g communication systems with many potential and exciting opportunities for research @xcite . for example , the trade - offs between system performance , hardware complexity , and energy consumption @xcite are still unclear . from the literature ,",
    "it is certain that the conventional fully digital mimo systems , in which each antenna connects with a dedicated radio frequency ( rf ) chain , are impractical for mmwave systems due to the prohibitively high cost , e.g. tremendous energy consumption of high resolution analog - to - digital convertors / digital - to - analog convertors ( adc / dacs ) and power amplifiers ( pas ) .",
    "therefore , several mmwave hybrid systems were proposed as compromised solutions which strike a balance between hardware complexity and system performance @xcite .",
    "specifically , the use of a large number of antennas , connected with only a small number of independent rf chains at transceivers , is adopted to exploit the large array gain to compensate the inherent high path loss in mmwave channels @xcite . yet",
    ", the hybrid system imposes a restriction on the number of rf chains which introduces a paradigm shift in the design of both resource allocation algorithms and transceiver signal processing .",
    "conventionally , pilot - aided channel estimation algorithms are widely adopted for fully digital multiuser ( mu ) time - division duplex ( tdd ) massive mimo systems @xcite operating in sub-@xmath0 ghz frequency bands .",
    "however , these algorithms can not be directly applied to hybrid mmwave systems as the number of rf chains is much small than the number of antennas .",
    "in fact , for the channel estimation in hybrid mmwave systems , the strategies of allocating analog / digital beams to different users and estimating the equivalent baseband channels are still an open area of research @xcite . recently , several improved mmwave channel estimation algorithms were proposed @xcite .",
    "the overlapped beam patterns and rate adaptation channel estimation were investigated in @xcite to reduce the required training time for channel estimation .",
    "then , the improved limited feedback hybrid channel estimation was proposed @xcite to maximize the received signal power at each single user so as to reduce the required training and feedback overheads .",
    "however , explicit channel state information ( csi ) feedback from users is still required for these channel estimation algorithms . in practice , csi feedbacks may cause system rate performance degradation due to the limited amount of the feedback and the limited resolution of csi quantization . in addition",
    ", the csi feedback also requires exceedingly high consumption of time resource .",
    "therefore , a low - complexity mmwave channel estimation algorithm , which does not require explicit csi feedback , is necessary to unlock the potential of hybrid mmwave systems .    in the literature ,",
    "most of the existing mmwave channel estimation algorithms leverage the sparsity of mmwave channels due to the extremely short wavelength of mmwave @xcite .",
    "generally , in suburban areas or outdoor long distance propagation environment @xcite , the sparsity of mmwave channels can be well exploited . in practical urban areas ( especially in the city center ) , the number of unexpected scattering clusters increases significantly and mmw communication channels may not be necessarily sparse .",
    "for instance , in the field measurements in daejeon city , korea , and the associated ray - tracing simulation @xcite , the angle of arrivals ( aoas ) at the bs and the users were observed under the impact of non - negligible scattering clusters .",
    "in addition , existing mmwave channel estimation algorithms @xcite , which are designed based on the assumption of channel sparsity , may not be applicable to non - sparse mmwave channels .",
    "indeed , the scattering clusters of mmwave channels due to macro - objects or backscattering from the objects , have a significant impact on system performance and can not be neglected in the system design .",
    "therefore , there is an emerging need for a channel estimation algorithm which is applicable to both non - sparse and sparse mmwave channels .    motivated by aforementioned discussions , we consider a mu hybrid mmwave system .",
    "in particular , we propose and detail a novel non - feedback non - iterative channel estimation algorithm which is applicable to both non - sparse and sparse mmwave channels .",
    "also , we analyze the achievable rate performance of the mmwave system using zf precoding based on the estimated equivalent channel information .        our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * we propose a three - step mu channel estimation scheme for mmwave channels . in the first two steps , we estimate the strongest aoas at both the bs and the users instead of estimating the combination of multiple aoas .",
    "the estimated strongest aoas will be exploited for the design of bs and users beamforming matrices . in the third step , all the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the bs via the beamforming matrices .",
    "we note that the proposed channel estimation scheme does not require explicit csi feedbacks from the users as well as iterative measurements .",
    "the required training overheads of our proposed algorithm only scale with the number of users .",
    "besides , the proposed algorithm is very general , which is not only applicable to sparse mmwave channels , but also suitable for non - sparse channels .",
    "* we analyze the achievable rate performance of the proposed zf precoding scheme based on the estimated csi of an equivalent channel .",
    "while assuming the equivalent csi is perfectly known at the bs , we derive a tight performance upper bound of our proposed scheme .",
    "also , we quantify the performance gap between the proposed hybrid scheme and the fully digital system in terms of achievable rate per user .",
    "it is interesting to note this the performance gap is determined by the strongest aoa component to the scattering component ratio .",

    "@xcite , mmwave channels were assumed to have sparse propagation paths between the bs and the users .",
    "however , in recent field tests , both a strong line - of - sight ( los ) component and non - negligible scattering component may exist in mmwave propagation channels @xcite , especially in the urban area .",

    "<S> in this paper , we develop a low - complexity channel estimation for hybrid millimeter wave ( mmwave ) systems , where the number of radio frequency ( rf ) chains is much less than the number of antennas equipped at each transceiver . the proposed channel estimation algorithm aims to estimate the strongest angle - of - arrivals ( aoas ) at both the base station ( bs ) and the users . </S>",
    "<S> then all the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the bs via these estimated strongest aoas to facilitate the channel estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm does not require any explicit channel state information ( csi ) feedback from the users and the associated signalling overhead of the algorithm is only proportional to the number of users , which is significantly less compared to various existing schemes . besides , the proposed algorithm is applicable to both non - sparse and sparse mmwave channel environments . </S>",
    "<S> based on the estimated csi , zero - forcing ( zf ) precoding is adopted for multiuser downlink transmission . in addition , we derive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme offer a considerable achievable rate gain compared to fully digital systems , where the number of rf chains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the achievable rate performance gap between the considered hybrid mmwave systems and the fully digital system is characterized , which provides useful system design insights . </S>"
