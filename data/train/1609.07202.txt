    "a brief summary of this paper s ongoing legacy is impossible , so we mention only a few notable successors : @xcite gives the precise asymptotics for the classical bootstrap percolation ; @xcite extends the result for all @xmath45^d$ ] and @xmath39 ; the hypercube @xmath46^n$ ] with @xmath44 is analyzed in @xcite ; and a recent paper @xcite addresses a bootstrap percolation model with drift .",
    "the main focus of the voluminous research is estimation of the critical probability on large finite sets , that is , the initial occupation density @xmath47 that makes spanning occur with probability @xmath48 .",
    "it is typical for this class of models that @xmath47 approaches zero very slowly with increasing system size , certainly slower than any power , and that the transition in the probability of spanning from small to close to @xmath49 near @xmath47 is very sharp .",

    "neither slow decay nor sharp transition happen for supercritical threshold growth on the two - dimensional lattice @xcite or threshold growth on hamming graphs @xcite , where instead power laws hold .",
    "one of our main results , theorem  [ intro - ld - rate ] , shows that , for any neighborhood growth , there is a well - defined power - law relationship between the density of the initial set , the size of the system , and the probability of spanning .",
    "another special case is the _ line growth _",

    "this was introduced under the name _ line percolation _ in the recent paper @xcite , which proves that @xmath53 , establishes a similar result in higher dimensions , and obtains the large deviation rate ( defined below ) for @xmath54 on a square .",
    "some of our results are therefore extensions of those in @xcite .",

    "the answer will involve finding the optimal energy - entropy balance , so there is a conceptual connection with large deviation theory , despite the fact that the probabilities involved are not exponential .",
