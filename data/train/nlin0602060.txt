    "at present methods for construction of special solutions of nonintegrable systems in terms of elementary ( more precisely , degenerated elliptic ) and elliptic functions are actively developed  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) . some of these methods are intended for the search for elliptic solutions only  @xcite , others allow to find either solutions in terms of elementary functions only  @xcite or both types of solutions  @xcite .",
    "note that the methods  @xcite allow to find multivalued solutions as well .",
    "elliptic and degenerate elliptic functions are single - valued functions , therefore , such solutions of a nonintegrable system exist only if there exist the laurent series solutions of it .",
    "such local solutions can be constructed by means of the ablowitz  ramani ",
    "segur algorithm of the painlev test  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover for a wide class of dynamical systems using this method one can find all possible laurent series expansions of solutions . in this way one obtains solutions only as formal series , that is sufficient , because really only a finite number of coefficients of these series is used .",
    "examples of construction of such solutions are given in  @xcite .",
    "the laurent series solutions give the information about the global behavior of differential systems and assist to look for both exact solutions  @xcite and the first integrals  @xcite .",
    "the laurent series solutions can be used to prove the nonexistence of elliptic solutions  @xcite as well .    in  @xcite r. conte and m. musette",
    "have proposed a new method for construction of single - valued special solutions of nonintegrable differential equations .",
    "a key idea of this method is the use of the laurent series solutions to transform the initial differential equation into a nonlinear system of algebraic equations . using this method one can in principal",
    "find all elliptic and degenerate elliptic solutions .",
    "unfortunately if the initial differential equation includes the large number of numeric parameters , then it is difficult to solve the obtained nonlinear system of algebraic equations .    the goal of this paper is to propose a modification of the conte  musette method , which allows to seek elliptic solutions only .",
    "we show that in this case it is possible to fix some parameters of the initial differential system and therefore simplify the resulting system of algebraic equations .",
    "to do this we use the hone s method , which has been proposed to prove the non - existence of elliptic solutions  @xcite . note that using our approach one can find in principal all elliptic solutions .    in",
    "@xcite the authors have transformed the initial system of two coupled ordinary differential equations into the equivalent single differential equation and only after this have constructed the laurent series solutions . in our paper",
    "we demonstrate that the analysis of the system of differential equations may be more useful than the analysis of the equivalent differential equation .",
    "moreover in this paper we show that if a system of differential equations includes a few functions it is possible to find the analytic form of a function which satisfies this system even without knowledge of other functions in the analytic form and without elimination of them from the system .",
    "in  @xcite r. conte and m. musette have proposed a way for searching of elliptic and degenerate elliptic solutions to a polynomial autonomous differential equation . in this section",
    "we reformulate this method for a system of such equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that any elliptic function ( including degenerate one ) is a solution of some first order polynomial autonomous differential equation .",
    "the classical results of p. painlev , l. von fuchs , c.a.a .",
    "briot and j .- c .",
    "bouquet allow one to construct the suitable form of such an equation , whose general solution is a meromorphic function with poles of order @xmath3  ( see details in  @xcite ) ) runs over nonnegative integer @xmath4 that are less than or equal to @xmath5 : @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is a positive integer number and @xmath8 are constants to be determined .",

    "( [ subequ ] ) and calculate the number of unknown coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   construct solutions of system ( [ f ] ) in the form of the laurent series .",
    "if such solutions do not exist or they correspond to known exact solutions , then no unknown single - valued solutions exist .",
    "note that , since system ( [ f ] ) is autonomous , the coefficients of the laurent series do not depend on the position of the singular point .",
    "they may depend on values of the numerical parameters of ( [ f ] ) .",
    "in addition , some of these coefficients ( the number of which is less than the order of system ( [ f ] ) ) may take arbitrary values and have to be considered as new numerical parameters .",
    "one should compute more coefficients of the laurent series than the number of numerical parameters in the laurent series plus the number of @xmath13 .",
    "3 .   choose a laurent series expansion for some function @xmath14 and substitute the obtained laurent series coefficients into eq .",
    "( [ subequ ] ) .",
    "this substitution transforms ( [ subequ ] ) into a linear and overdetermined system in @xmath8 with coefficients depending on numerical parameters .",
    "eliminate coefficients @xmath8 and get a nonlinear system in parameters .",
    "solve the obtained nonlinear system .",
    "r.  conte and m.  musette note that a computer algebra package is highly recommended for using of their method  @xcite .",
    "steps of this algorithm can be implemented in computer algebra systems separately .",
    "for the given system it is easy to calculate the laurent series solutions to any accuracy .",
    "these computations base on the painlev test , which has been implemented in the most popular computer algebra systems  @xcite .",
    "note that when one has computed a sufficient number of the laurent series coefficients he can forget about the system of differential equations and work only with coefficients of the obtained series .",
    "the first package of computer algebra procedures , which realize the third and the fourth steps of the algorithm , has been written in amp  @xcite by r.  conte .",
    "one can also use our maple and reduce packages of procedures , which are accessible in internet  @xcite and are described in  @xcite .",
    "so , one passes the first four steps of algorithm without any difficulties .",
    "at the fifth ( last ) step one should solve an overdetermined system of nonlinear algebraic equations . the standard method for solving of such systems",
    "is the construction of a lexicographically ordered grbner basis  @xcite . the buchberger algorithm  @xcite guarantees a construction of a grbner basis in a finite number of steps .",
    "however , appropriate estimates of the number of steps required for constructing of this basis do not exist .",
    "the required computer memory depends , in the general case , exponentially on the number of the unknowns .",
    "therefore , this number should be made as small as possible .",

    "note that both the cgle3 and the cgle5 have only one - parameter laurent - series solutions in the wave form and there exist only a finite number of such solutions .",
    "our approach can be effectively used in investigation of any system ( [ f ] ) or a single differential equation , for which only a finite number of different laurent - series solutions exist . note that for wide class of such differential equations it has been proved that all their meromorphic solutions are elliptic ( maybe degenerated ) functions  @xcite .",

    "for example , the fan s technology  @xcite allows to find solutions of nonintegrable systems , which are polynomials of the function @xmath189 , that satisfies the following equation : @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are constants to be determined .",
    "the function @xmath188 is a solution of a similar equation with @xmath193 , but , using the fan s approach , it is impossible to find @xmath194 without knowledge of @xmath63 , which satisfies the more complex equation  ( [ equm ] ) .",
    "the kudryashov s method  @xcite as well as the methods  @xcite , proposed to search both elliptic and elementary solutions , attempt to find solutions for the initial differential system at all values of the numeric parameters such that single - valued solutions can exist .",
    "the use of the residue theorem and the hone s method allows us to fix some of these parameters and to simplify calculations without loss of elliptic solutions .",
    "note that we not only find elliptic solutions for the cgle5 , but also we prove that there are no other elliptic solutions for @xmath195 . using the standard methods one can say nothing about uniqueness of the obtained special elliptic solutions .    to find solutions for the cgle5 the authors of papers  @xcite put some restrictions on dependence between @xmath188 and @xmath65 .",
    "the use of laurent solutions allows us to search @xmath188 without any restrictions and without eliminating @xmath65 from system ( [ system ] ) .",
    "in this paper we propose a new approach for the search of elliptic solutions to systems of differential equations .",
    "the proposed algorithm is a modification of the conte ",
    "musette method  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the search of elliptic solutions only .",
    "a key idea of this restriction is to simplify calculations by means of the use of a few laurent series solutions instead of one and the use of the residue theorem .",
    "the application of our approach to the quintic complex one - dimensional ginzburg ",
    "landau equation ( cgle5 ) allows to find elliptic solutions in the wave form .",
    "let us point out that the obtained solutions are the first elliptic solutions for the cgle5 . using the investigation of the cgle5 as an example , we demonstrate that to find elliptic solutions the analysis of a system of differential equations is more preferable than the analysis of the equivalent single differential equation .    we also find restrictions on coefficients , which are necessary conditions for the existence of elliptic solutions for the cgle5 . to do this we develop the hone s method  @xcite .",
    "we show that this method is useful not only to prove the nonexistence of elliptic solutions , but also to find new elliptic solutions .",
    "note that the hone s method and , therefore , our approach , are so effective in the case of the cgle5 , because coefficients of the laurent series solutions depend only on parameters of equations , i.e. they do not include additional arbitrary parameters ( have no resonances ) .",
    "it is an important problem to generalize the hone s method on the laurent series solutions with resonances .",
    "another way for future investigations is the generalization of the conte ",
