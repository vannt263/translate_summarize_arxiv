    "even though a variety of cosmological tests demonstrate that the inflation plus cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) paradigm is extremely successful in describing the history and structure of the universe  ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are still several features of the large - scale distribution of matter that are difficult to explain .",
    "one is the so - called `` void phenomenon '' , first noticed by  @xcite , in which cosmic voids  the deep underdensities in the galaxy distribution  appear emptier than expected from @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "the observation of this phenomenon motivated the development of models in which a dynamical scalar field responsible for dark energy  ( de ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is coupled to the dark matter ( dm ) , giving an additional fifth force of nature that would help empty out the voids  @xcite .",
    "other possibilities to explain the void phenomenon have since been proposed , including modified gravity  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and an improved understanding of the relationship between galaxy formation and environment  @xcite .",
    "most analyses of coupled dm - de have focused on the statistics of overdense regions , such as the halo mass function  @xcite , the galaxy two - point correlation function  @xcite and galaxy cluster gas properties  @xcite . however , in these high - density environments it is difficult to distinguish effects due to coupling from non - linear evolution and complex baryonic physics .    focusing on underdense regions would appear to be a more natural way to study the void phenomenon .",
    "on the theory side , studies have considered the effect of coupling in the dark sector on the void number function  @xcite , density profiles  @xcite , and shapes  @xcite .",
    "observationally , void populations in galaxy surveys can be compared to expectations from simulations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most recently , the study of  @xcite found no evidence for departures from @xmath0cdm  for a population of voids at higher redshift ( @xmath2 ) , but  @xcite noted the existence of a large void that appears to be statistically incompatible with predictions of @xmath0cdm  @xmath1-body simulations .    this comparative inattention",
    "to voids themselves can be explained by the relative dearth of voids in observations and the lack of robust void statistical tools that can be used to connect theoretical results to observational reality .",
    "however , there have been significant advancements in the past few years , including the release of large public void catalogs  @xcite from the sdss galaxy surveys  @xcite .",
    "secondly , there has been significant efforts to single out especially sensitive void properties and make predictions for the void signals in data  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the combination of enhanced tools and a statistically meaningful sample of voids means that predictions of the effects of coupled dm - de within voids can now make direct contact with data .    in this _",
    "letter _ we provide an initial assessment of the impact of coupled dm - de on void statistics such as number functions , ellipticities , and radial density profiles . while this work is similar to that of  @xcite",
    ", we particularly focus on the ability of current low - redshift galaxy surveys such as the sdss dr7",
    "@xcite to distinguish coupled models from @xmath0cdm   with the population of voids identified in their limited volumes and galaxy densities  @xcite .",
    "we also incorporate the latest theoretical work , such as the recently - described universal density profile  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hsw ) , to understand and quantify our results .    in the following section we briefly present the quintessence model , its implementation in simulation , and our method for finding voids . in section  [ sec : effects ]",
    "we discuss the effects on void properties , and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with comments on the relevancy for current surveys and outline strategies for more complete analyses in the future .",
    "under quintessence the dark energy scalar field @xmath3 has the lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath3 interacts with the matter field @xmath5 through the mass term of the dark matter particles . in this work",
    "we assume the  @xcite self interaction potential : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the planck mass and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two parameters that must be fixed by fitting to observations  @xcite .    under this interaction",
    "the dark matter particle mass evolves as @xmath10 this evolution implies that the dark matter particles experience an effective gravitational constant of the form  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the standard newtonian value .",
    "we will fix the interaction term to be constant such that @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to a dark matter particle mass that decreases as a function of time to its @xmath14 @xmath0cdm  value . for this work ,",
    "we contrast a @xmath0cdm  case with a single interacting model with parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( hereafter referred to as cde ) .",
    "we used the simulations described in  @xcite and  @xcite for this analysis .",
    "briefly , these interactions were implemented with a modified version of the tree - pm code ` gadget-2 `  @xcite , with initial conditions generated using a version of the ` n - genic ` code suitably modified to account for the interactions .",
    "both simulations had identical initial random phases , and were generated using a first order zeldovich approximation with suitable modifications to account for cde .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in both @xmath0cdm  and cde simulations were @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( normalized at @xmath14 ) and were constructed to have dark matter power spectra within current observational limits .",
    "these simulations took place in a cubic volume of @xmath23  @xmath24mpc  per side using @xmath25 dm amd @xmath25 gas particles .",
    "we ignored the gas particles and randomly subsampled the @xmath26 dark matter particles to achieve a mean density of @xmath27 per cubic  @xmath24mpc .",
    "this combination of simulation volume , density , and redshift approximates the _",
    "dim2 _ volume - limited sdss galaxy sample used in  @xcite .",
    "we subsample the simulations to have identical numbers of particles .",
    "while dm - de coupling would presumably change the luminosity function of galaxies , leading to a change in the total number of galaxies in a magnitude - limited survey , we are modeling a _ volume_-limited survey , which will have identical number counts in each scenario ( assuming that the change in galaxy abundances occurs below the magnitude threshold of the survey ) .",
    "additionally ,  @xcite found that bias does not greatly impact ( @xmath28 ) void density profiles and abundances , and that the effects of bias are constant across difference cosmological models . in summary , to examine the impact of dm - de coupling in a realistic scenario we may ignore galaxy ( and halo ) bias and work only with subsampled dark matter .",
    "we identify voids with the vide toolkit  @xcite , which uses zobov  @xcite to construct a voronoi tessellation of the tracer particles and apply the watershed transform to group basins into voids . as in  @xcite",
    ", we remove voids smaller than the mean particle separation ( @xmath29  @xmath24mpc ) and those with central densities higher than @xmath30 the mean particle density @xmath31 .",
    "additionally , to limit the growth of voids we set a threshold of @xmath32 for joining additional zones into voids ( see  @xcite for a discussion ) . if a void consists of only a single zone then this restriction does not apply .",
    "figure  [ fig : numberfunc ] shows the cumulative number function for the @xmath0cdm  and cde simulations .",
    "we immediately note the presence of large voids in the cde simulation , well beyond the largest voids in the @xmath0cdm  simulation .",
    "however , for smaller void sizes ( @xmath33  @xmath24mpc ) the two void populations are almost indistinguishable .",
    "the total number of voids in both models is nearly the same due to our fixing of @xmath34 , since constraining the freedom of this parameter implies that at least some statistical properties of the cosmic web must be retained when departing from @xmath0cdm . also , the model we consider here has only modest ( @xmath35 ) departures from standard gravity .    to interpret these results we match voids in @xmath0cdm  to voids in the cde simulation using the approach described in  @xcite :",
    "a `` match '' is a corresponding void whose center lies within the void under consideration and has the most amount of shared particles .",
    "the former condition prevents matching to voids in the nearby volume that only happen to share a few edge particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : matchprops ] shows the relative radius ( @xmath36 ) and relative macrocenter distance ( @xmath37 ) for the matched voids . with this insight we see that while the largest voids are largely unaffected , small- and medium - scale voids generally experience radii inflation of @xmath38 , and occasionally dramatic increases of up to a factor of two . the right panel of figure  [ fig : matchprops ] reveals why : larger relative radii tend to correspond to large relative distances , up to the @xmath0cdm  void effective radius .",
    "thus the walls between medium - scale voids are thinned out enough in the presence of cde to allow the watershed to merge them together into a single larger void .",
    "this explains the feature at @xmath39 @xmath24mpc  in the cde number function : these @xmath0cdm  voids are merging together to form the largest cde voids . the primary cause of this thinning out , whether the modified expansion history or the fifth force itself , requires more investigation .    in figure  [ fig:1d_profile ]",
    "we show one - dimensional radial profiles for all samples in radius bins of width 10 @xmath24mpc . to compute the profiles we take all voids in the radius bin , align all their macrocenters , and measure the total density in thin spherical shells .",
    "we normalize each density profile to the mean number density of the sample and show all profiles as a function of the relative radius , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the median void size in the stack .",
    "we do not individually rescale the voids since that tends to dampen the compensation region  @xcite , which we wish to highlight in this analysis .",
    "the profiles in each stack follow the same overall structure ( a deeply - underdense core , a steep wall , an overdense `` compensation '' shell , and a flattening to the mean density ) ; however , there are some contrasts between @xmath0cdm  and cde voids . first ,",
    "while there are almost no differences between @xmath0cdm  and cde voids at the smallest scales , greater discrepancies appear for the larger ( @xmath42 @xmath24mpc ) stacks . from 20 to 30 @xmath24mpc , cde voids have higher compensation shells , but after 30 @xmath24mpc  the cde voids are clearly larger and flatter ( i.e. , lower density contrast between wall and center ) .",
    "this difference in the largest stack is statistically highly significant .    to quantify and understand these differences",
    ", we fit all the profiles to the universal function presented in hsw : @xmath43 while there are four parameters total in the model , hsw describe a two - parameter reduced model where @xmath44 this two - parameter model describes all but the largest voids very accurately , and is appropriate for the analysis here  @xcite .",
    "there are two free parameters to this model : @xmath45 , the radius at which the profile reaches mean density , and @xmath46 , the density in the central core .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile_fits ] shows all best - fit values of @xmath46 and @xmath45 for all stacks in both simulations .    the fitting parameters elucidate the relationship between dm - de coupling and profile shape .",
    "all voids in all models maintain roughly the same central density of @xmath47 , regardless of size .",
    "however , the evolution of the scaling radius as a function of void size is significantly different between the two models .",
    "indeed , the largest cde voids in this volume become undercompensated , whereas no @xmath0cdm  voids reach the necessary scales .",
    "since almost all @xmath0cdm  voids can be matched to a cde counterpart , figure  [ fig : matchprops ] also allows us to interpret these results : the larger cde voids are actually merged  not enlarged  @xmath0cdm  voids , making the voids appear uniformly larger without greatly affecting the central densities .",
    "as in the profiles themselves , the differences between individual profiles are only statistically significant for the largest radius bin . however , there are relatively few voids here , and we may be underestimating the true uncertainty .",
    "we also examined ellipticities using the inertia tensor method as described in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "however , as  @xcite discovered , in sparse populations such as galaxies it is very difficult to statistically separate @xmath0cdm  from alternative cosmologies using void shapes .",
    "we found no significant distinctions in the ellipticities .",
    "we have examined the effects on voids due to coupling between dark matter and dark energy with realistic galaxy survey volumes and tracer densities and provided an initial assessment of the feasibility of current surveys to detect the coupling with voids .",
    "we have found that the coupling produces much larger voids compared to @xmath0cdm  mostly by merging medium - scale voids .",
    "additionally , we have quantified the effects of coupling on the radial density profiles by finding the best fits to the analytic hsw profile , and found that dm - de coupling can more easily make voids underdense .",
    "traditional probes of large - scale structure such as the power spectrum have difficulty differentiating cde models from @xmath0cdm  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but voids are exceptionally powerful discriminating tools .",
    "we have studied a relatively weak coupling strength ; thus even a null result would be informative about the capabilities of void properties to distinguish these models .",
    "however , even with limited survey volumes and only @xmath48 total voids the number functions are distinguishable in a statistically significant manner .",
    "density profiles of the largest voids , despite the relatively few number of voids , also provide measurable differences in the scaling radius @xmath45 of the hsw profile , although future simulations with larger volumes will be needed to verify the precise statistical significance of these profile differences .",
    "the void population we have studied is fairly representative of  and accessible with  current low - redshift galaxy surveys  @xcite .",
    "these results may explain the large void identified by  @xcite . in addition , using halo occupation distribution modeling  @xcite and accounting for survey geometries ,  @xcite was able to match @xmath0cdm  simulations to observed void populations .",
    "thus , coupled dm - de may already be measurable with current data sets .",
    "however , for a complete comparison of the void abundance we must include mask effects  @xcite .",
    "we also have not included the effects of galaxy bias and distortions to the density profiles from peculiar velocities .",
    "however , we can use techniques such as those presented by  @xcite to construct the real - space profile without modeling .",
    "we will save a more detailed comparison and measurement of a constraint for future work .",
    "this study is only an initial assessment comparing one cde model to @xmath0cdm , using simulations optimized to study the properties of high - density clusters .",
    "we also examined other coupling strengths ( eq .  [ eq : gravity ] ) but did not find significant differences among the models with this limited void population .",
    "we are preparing larger simulations that will allow us to examine the detailed relationship between coupling strength and void properties and assess the ability of high - redshift galaxy surveys such as boss  @xcite to probe these cosmologies using voids .",
    "in addition , future galaxy surveys will only serve to increase the statistical significance of these differences , leading to ever - further constraints on these models .",
