    "prior to the dawn of the exoplanet era , it was thought that planetary systems around other stars would likely resemble our own - with small , rocky planets close to their host stars , and the more massive , giant planets at greater distances . with the discovery of the first exoplanets , however ,",
    "that paradigm was shattered - and it rapidly became clear that many planetary systems are dramatically different to our own . but to truly understand how unusual ( or typical ) the solar system is , we must find true jupiter and saturn analogs : massive planets on decade - long orbits around their hosts .",
    "the only way to find such planets is to monitor stars on decade - long timescales , searching for the telltale motion that might reveal such distant neighbours .",
    "nearly three decades of planet search have resulted in a great unveiling , at every stage of which we are finding our expectations consistently upturned as the true diversity of worlds becomes ever more apparent .",
    "much progress has been made in understanding the occurrence rates and properties of planets orbiting within @xmath41 au of their stars , brought on by the _",

    "* ) and the advent of doppler velocimetry at precisions of 1  @xcite .",
    "while _ kepler _ has been hugely successful in exploring the frequency of planets close to their stars , such transit surveys are not suited to search for planetary systems like our own - with giant planets moving on orbits that take decades to complete . to understand the occurrence of such systems requires a different approach - radial velocity monitoring of individual stars on decadal timescales .",
    "sometimes overshadowed by the _",
    "dicoveries , but equally important for a complete picture of planetary system properties , are the results from ongoing `` legacy '' doppler surveys , which are now sensitive to giant planets in orbits approaching 20 years .",
    "those surveys include , for example , the mcdonald observatory planet search @xcite , the california planet search @xcite , the anglo - australian planet search @xcite , and the geneva planet search @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture is that the solar system is not typical of planetary systems in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "for example , super - earths , planets with masses @xmath43 - 10 , are extremely common yet are completely absent from our solar system .",
    "jupiter - like planets in jupiter - like orbits appear to be relatively uncommon , orbiting only about 6% of solar - type stars @xcite .",

    "we explore the dynamical stability of the two candidate orbital solutions .",
    "in order to understand the dynamical context of the two distinct orbital solutions presented above , and to see whether they yield planetary systems that are dynamically feasible , we followed a now well - established route ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for each solution , we performed 126,075 unique integrations of the system using the hybrid integrator within the _",
    "n_-body dynamics package , mercury @xcite . in each of those simulations",
    ", we held the initial orbit of the innermost planet fixed at its nominal best - fit values ( as detailed in table  [ planetparams1 ] ) .",
    "we then proceeded to systematically move the orbit of the outermost planet through the full @xmath16 uncertainty ranges for semi - major axis , @xmath17 , eccentricity , @xmath18 , argument of periastron , @xmath19 , and mean anomaly , @xmath20 . in this manner",
    ", we created a regular grid of solutions , testing 41 unique values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , 15 unique values of @xmath19 , and 5 unique values of @xmath20 .",
    "these simulations make two assumptions : first , that the two planets move on coplanar orbits ( as is essentially the case in the solar system ) , and second , we assign the planets their minimum masses ( m  sin  @xmath21 ) as derived from the radial velocity data . in a number of previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have examined the impact of mutual inclination on system stability .",
    "however , for widely separated planets , the inclination between the two orbits seems to play little role in their stability .",
    "it seems most likely that there would not be large mutual inclination between the orbits of the planets ; from a dynamical point of view , given the assumption that the two planets formed in a dynamically cool disk , it is challenging to imagine how they could achieve significant mutual inclination without invoking the presence of a highly inclined distant perturber ( i.e. an undetected binary companion , driving excitation through the kozai mechanism ) .",
    "it is certainly reasonable to assume that the orbits are most likely relatively coplanar , as is seen in the solar system giant planets , and also in those multiple exoplanet systems with orbital inclinations constrained by transits @xcite or by resolved debris disk observations @xcite .    regarding the use of minimum masses",
    ", one would expect increased planetary masses to destabilise the systems .",
    "the reason for this can be seen when one considers the `` gravitational reach '' of a planet , which can be defined in terms of its hill radius .",
    "the hill radius is proportional to the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit , but only increases as the cube root of the planet s mass . as a result ,",
    "doubling the mass of a planet only increases its gravitational reach , and therefore its hill radius , by a factor of @xmath22 - a relatively minor change .",
    "the simulations were set to run for a maximum of 100 million years , but were brought to a premature end if one or other of the planets were ejected from the system or collided with the central body .",
    "simulations were also curtailed if the two planets collided with one another . for each of these conditions , the time at which the simulation finished",
    "was recorded , allowing us to create dynamical maps of the system to examine the dynamical context of the orbits presented above , and to see whether the system was dynamically feasible .",
    "such maps have , in the past , revealed certain systems to be dynamically unfeasible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other cases , dynamical mappings have resulted in stronger constraints for a given system s orbits than was possible solely on the grounds of the observational data ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dynamical simulations therefore offer the potential to help distinguish between different solutions with similar goodness of fit , such as those proposed in this work , as well as yielding an important dynamical sanity check.    to complement these dynamical simulations , we also chose to trial a new technique for the dynamical analysis of newly discovered systems .",
    "rather than populate regular grids in element space , whilst holding the better constrained planet s initial orbit fixed , we instead performed repeated fits to the observational data . in our fitting , we required solely that the solutions produced lie within @xmath23 of the best - fit solution , allowing all parameters to vary freely .",
    "this created clouds of potential solutions distributed around the best fit out to a range of @xmath24 .",
    "we then randomly selected solutions to evenly sample the phase space between the best - fit solution ( at @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 .",
    "as before , we generated 126,075 unique solutions for each of the two scenarios presented above .    where our traditional dynamical maps explore the dynamical context of the solutions in a readily apparent fashion , these new simulations are designed to instead examine the stability of the system as a function of the goodness of fit of the orbital solution . in addition , they allow us to explore the stability as a function of the masses assigned to the two planets in question . as such",
    ", they provide a natural complement to the traditional maps , as can be seen below .",
    "figure  [ shortperiodorbit ] shows the dynamical context of the short period solution for the two planet hd30177 system , as described in table  [ planetparams1 ] .",
    "the best fit solution lies in an area of strong dynamical instability , with the majority of locations within the 1@xmath27 uncertainty range being similarly unstable .",
    "there is , however , a small subset of solutions in that range that are stable , marking the inner edge of a broad stable region seen towards larger semi - major axes and smaller eccentricities .",
    "the small island of stability at @xmath28  au is the result of the planets becoming trapped in mutual 2:1 mean - motion resonance , whilst the narrow curved region of moderate stability at high eccentricities is caused by orbits for hd30177c with periastron located at the semi - major axis of hd30177b . dynamical stability for the system on near - circular ,",
    "non - resonant orbits is only seen in these simulations exterior to the planet s mutual 3:1 mean - motion resonance , located at @xmath29  au ( and the cause of the small island of stability at non - zero eccentricities at that semi - major axis ) . as a result",
    ", these simulations suggest that the short - period solution is not dynamically favoured , unless the orbital period for hd30177c is significantly longer than the best fit , the orbit markedly less eccentric , or if the two planets are trapped in mutual 3:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "these results are strongly supported by our subsidiary integrations - the results of which are shown in figures  [ sp_eccentricity]-[sp_mass ] .",
    "figure  [ sp_eccentricity ] shows the stability of the candidate hd30177 planetary systems as a function of the eccentricities of the two planets , their period ratio , and the goodness of the fit of the solution tested . in figure",
    "[ sp_eccentricity ] , the upper plots show all solutions within @xmath23 of the best fit , whilst the lower show only those solutions within @xmath30 of the best fit .",
    "it is immediately apparent that truly stable solutions are limited to only a very narrow range of the plots - namely two narrow regions with low eccentricities , and widely separated orbits .",
    "in fact , these solutions all lie at , or somewhat outside , the location of the 3:1 mean motion resonance between the two planets ( p1/p2 @xmath31 ) .",
    "the inner of the two stable patches are those orbits that are resonant , whilst the outermost are those sufficiently separated to be exterior to that resonance .",
    "even at these stable separations , the system is only feasible for low - to - moderate planetary eccentricities - solutions that ascribe an eccentricity of @xmath32 or greater to either planet prove strongly unstable .",
    "figure  [ sp_mass ] shows the influence of the mass of the two planets on the stability of the solution .",
    "the resonant and extra - resonant stable regions are again clearly visible , and it is apparent that the masses of the two planets seem to have little influence on the stability of the solution . a slight influence from the planetary mass can be seen in the middle row of figure  [ sp_mass ] , which shows that stable solutions with the lowest cumulative planet mass ( i.e. @xmath33 ) have slightly higher mean eccentricities than those for larger cumulative masses .",
    "this effect is only weak , and is the result of the least massive solutions veering away from lower eccentricities . given that the eccentricities of planetary orbits tend to be somewhat over - estimated when fitting radial velocity data @xcite , this may be an indication that the lower - mass solutions are slightly less favourable than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "finally , the bottom row of figure  [ sp_mass ] shows the stability of the solution clouds as a function of the maximum eccentricity between the two planets ( i.e. the value plotted on the y - axis is whichever is greater of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "this reinforces the result from figure  [ sp_eccentricity ] that solutions with either of the two planets moving on orbits with @xmath36 are unstable regardless of their separation , or the mass of the planets involved .    taken in concert ,",
    "our results show that , whilst short - period solutions for the hd30177 system can prove dynamically stable , they require the two planets to either be trapped in mutual 3:1 mean motion resonance , or to be more widely spaced , and further require that neither planet move on an orbit with eccentricity greater than 0.25 .",
    "but what of our alternative , longer - period solution for the planetary system ?",
    "figure  [ longperiodorbit ] shows the dynamical context of that solution . unlike the short period solution",
    ", the two planets are now sufficiently widely separated that the great majority of orbits around the best - fit solution are now dynamically stable for the full 100 myr of our simulations . at the very inner edge of the plot ,",
    "the cliff of instability exterior to the planet s mutual 3:1 mean - motion resonance can again be seen , as can hints of the moderate stability afforded by the periastron of hd30177 c falling at the semi - major axis of hd30177 b ( top left of the plot ) .",
    "purely on the basis of this plot , the longer - period solution seems markedly more dynamically feasible , a result once again borne out by the plots of our subsidiary simulations of the long - period solution ( figures  [ lp_eccentricity]-[lp_mvse_max ] ) .",
    "figure  [ lp_eccentricity ] reveals many of the same features as figure  [ longperiodorbit ] - a significant proportion of the solutions are dynamically stable - particularly those within @xmath30 of the best fit ( lower panels ) .",
    "the greater the orbital separation of the two planets , the greater can be their orbital eccentricities before destabilising the system .",
    "in addition , however , the destabilising influence of distant mean - motion resonances is revealed in these plots , as the notches of instability carved into the distribution at specific period ratios . aside from these few unstable regions , however ,",
    "the great majority of solutions within @xmath30 of the best fit are stable .",
    "figure  [ lp_mass ] shows that the mass ratio of the planets ( left hand plots ) has little or no influence on their stability . interestingly ,",
    "though , the lower - right hand panel reveals an apparent relationship in the fitting between the cumulative mass of the planets and their mutual separation .",
    "the more widely separated the two planets ( and hence the more distant is hd 30177c ) , the greater their cumulative mass .",
    "this is not at all surprising : the more distant hd 30177c is , the greater its mass would have to be to achieve a radial velocity signal of a given amplitude .",
    "this feature is therefore entirely expected , but nevertheless serves to nicely illustrate the relationship between different parameters in the radial velocity fitting process .",
    "figure  [ lp_mvse_mean ] again reveals that the more eccentric the orbits of the planets , the more likely they are to prove unstable - although once again , the great majority of the sampled phase - space proves dynamically stable .",
    "more interesting , however , are the results shown in figure  [ lp_mvse_max ] .",
    "the left - hand panels of that plot , which show the stability of the solutions as a function of the maximum eccentricity between the two panels ( y - axis ) and the mass ratio of the two planets ( x - axis ) suggest that , the closer the two planetary masses are to parity , the more likely eccentric orbits are to be stable .",
    "by contrast , the lower - right hand plot suggests that the greater the sum of the planetary masses , the more likely solutions with high eccentricities are to be stable . taken in concert ,",
    "these results are once again a reflection of the relationship between cumulative mass and orbital separation .",
    "that is , the greater the orbital separation of the two planets , the greater their cumulative mass , and the closer to parity their masses become ( since our fits suggest that hd30177c is the less massive of the two ) . at the same time",
    ", we saw from figure  [ lp_eccentricity ] that , the greater the separation of the two planets , the more stable are those orbital solutions at higher eccentricity .",
    "so once again , we are looking at the same thing - these two apparent trends are the result of the requirement that a more distant hd30177c must be more massive in order to generate the observed radial velocity amplitude .",
    "we present the results of new radial velocity observations of hd30177 , which reveal for the first time the presence of a second , long - period planet in that system .",
    "two possible orbital solutions for the planetary system are presented - one with a shorter - period orbit for hd30177 c , and one with the two planets more widely spaced , and hd30177 c on a longer period orbit .",
    "the two solutions are virtually indistinguishable from one another in terms of the quality of fit that they provide to the data . however , the short - period solution placed the two planets on orbits sufficiently compact that they lie closer than their mutual 3:1 mean - motion resonance .",
    "although several highly compact multi - planet systems have been discovered in recent years , it has become apparent that such compact systems rely on dynamical stability conferred by mutual resonant planetary orbits . as such",
    ", it seemed prudent to build on our earlier work , and carry out detailed @xmath37-body simulations of the two potential solutions for the hd30177 system , to see whether it was possible to rule either out on dynamical stability grounds .",
    "our results reveal that , although some stable solutions can be found for the short - period variant of the hd30177 system , those solutions require orbital eccentricities for the planets that are typically smaller than given by the best fit solution , and require hd30177 c to be somewhat more distant than the best fit .",
    "in other words , the require relatively low eccentricity orbits for that planet exterior to its mutual 3:1 mean - motion resonance with hd30177 b. by contrast , the great majority of the longer - period solutions tested proved dynamically stable - and across a much greater range of potential semi - major axes and orbital eccentricities .    as a result , we consider that the most likely solution for the orbit of hd30177c is the longer period option : an m  sin  @xmath23.1   planet with @xmath38  au , @xmath39 , and an orbital period of @xmath40 days .",
    "we note that for inclinations @xmath4130@xmath42 , the two orbiting bodies in the hd30177 system fall into the brown dwarf regime . with an orbital separation of @xmath310au",
    ", one can consider hd30177c to be one of the first members of an emerging class of `` saturn analogs , '' referring to planets with orbital separations similar to saturn . just as long - term radial velocity surveys have begun to characterize `` jupiter analogs '' @xcite , the continuation of legacy surveys such as the anglo - australian planet search will enable us to probe the population of planets in saturn - like orbits in the coming decade .",
