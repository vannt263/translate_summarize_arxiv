    "in this study we focus on the parametric inference in the drift coefficient @xmath13 and in the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 of a multidimensional diffusion model @xmath15 with small diffusion coefficient , when it is observed at discrete times on a fixed time interval in the asymptotics @xmath16 .",
    "this asymptotics has been widely studied and has proved fruitful in applied problems , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "our interest in considering this kind of diffusions is motivated by the fact that they are natural approximations of epidemic processes .",
    "indeed , the classical stochastic @xmath17 model in a closed population , describing variations over time in susceptible ( @xmath18 ) , infectious ( @xmath19 ) and removed ( @xmath20 ) infividuals , is a bi - dimensional continuous - time markovian jump process .",
    "the population size ( @xmath21 ) based normalization of this process asymptotically leads to an ode system . before passing to the limit",
    ", the forward kolmogorov diffusion equation allows describing the epidemic dynamics through a bidimensional diffusion , with diffusion coefficient proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , epidemics are discretely observed and therefore we are interested in the statistical setting defined by discrete data sampled at times @xmath23 on a fixed interval @xmath5 $ ] with @xmath24 .",
    "the number of data points is @xmath25 and @xmath8 , the sampling interval , is not necessarily small .",
    "historically , statistics for diffusions were developed for continuously observed processes leading to explicit formulations of the likelihood ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "two asymptotics exist for estimating @xmath7 for a diffusion continuously observed on a time interval @xmath5 $ ] : @xmath26 for recurrent diffusions and @xmath27 fixed and the diffusion coefficient tends to @xmath28 . in practice , however , observations are not continuous but partial , with various mechanisms underlying the missingness , which leads to intractable likelihoods .",
    "one classical case consists in sample paths discretely observed with a sampling interval @xmath8 .",
    "this adds another asymptotic framework @xmath11 and raises the question of estimating parameters in the diffusion coefficient ( see @xcite , @xcite for @xmath27 fixed and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for @xmath29 ) .    since nineties ,",
    "statistical methods associated to discrete data have been developed in the asymptotics of small diffusion coefficient ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "considering a discretely observed diffusion on @xmath30 with constant ( @xmath31 ) diffusion coefficient , genon - catalot ( 1990 ) obtained , using the gaussian approximating process @xcite , a consistent and @xmath32-normal and efficient estimator of @xmath7 under the condition @xmath33 .",
    "the author additionally proved that this estimator possessed good properties also for @xmath8 fixed .",
    "uchida @xcite obtained similar results using approximate martingale estimating equations .",
    "then , srensen @xcite obtained , as @xmath16 , consistent and @xmath32-normal estimators of a parameter @xmath34 present in both the drift and diffusion coefficient , with no assumption on @xmath8 , but under additional conditions not verified in the case of distinct parameters in the drift and diffusion coefficient . for this latter case , srensen and uchida @xcite obtained consistent and @xmath32-normal estimators of @xmath7 and consistent and @xmath35-normal estimators of @xmath36 under the condition @xmath37 and @xmath38 bounded",
    "this result was later extended by gloter and srensen @xcite to the case where @xmath39 is bounded for some @xmath40 .",
    "their results rely on a class of contrast processes based on the expansion of the infinitesimal generator of the diffusion , the order of the expansion being driven by the respective magnitude of @xmath41 and @xmath8 and requiring this knowledge ( value of @xmath42 ) , which might be a drawback when applying the method .",
    "moreover , this contrast becomes difficult to handle for values of @xmath8 that are not very small with respect to @xmath6 .    to overcome this drawback",
    ", we consider a simple contrast based on the gaussian approximation of the diffusion process @xmath43 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to gloter and srensen @xcite , our contrast has generic formulation , regardless to the ratio between @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the standard balance condition between @xmath6 and @xmath8 of previous works is here removed .",
    "our study extends the results of @xcite to the case of multidimensional diffusion processes with parameters in both the drift and diffusion coefficient .",
    "we consider successively the cases @xmath8 fixed and @xmath44 .",
    "we obtain consistent and @xmath32-normal estimators of @xmath7 ( when @xmath36 is unknown or equal to a known function of @xmath7 ) for fixed @xmath8 . for high frequency data , we obtain results similar to @xcite , but without any assumption on @xmath6 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the estimators obtained are analytically calculated on a simple example , the cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) model .",
    "finally , they are compared based on simulation studies in the case of a financial two - factor model @xcite and of the epidemic @xmath17 model @xcite , for various magnitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "after an introduction , section 2 contains the notations and preliminary results on the stochastic taylor expansion of the diffusion .",
    "sections 3 and 4 , which constitute the core of the paper , present analytical results , both in terms of contrast functions and estimators properties .",
    "we investigate in section 3 the inference when @xmath8 fixed and @xmath16 in three contexts depending on whether the parameter @xmath36 in the diffusion coefficient is unknown , equal to a known function of @xmath7 ( with the special case @xmath45 ) or whether the diffusion coefficient is multiplicative .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the case @xmath11 .",
    "results are applied in section 5 to the cir model . moreover , the different estimators obtained are compared based on numerical simulations to the minimum contrast estimator of gloter and srensen @xcite , mainly in the context of epidemic data .",
