    "a recurring theme in the study of unconventional superconductors is the pairing of electrons via repulsive interactions,@xcite rather than the attractive interaction mediated by phonons that occurs in conventional superconductors .",
    "cooper pairing driven by a repulsive interaction such as exchange of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations carries a distinguishing feature that the superconducting gap @xmath4 has changes in sign for different values of momentum @xmath5 in the brillouin zone .",
    "this means that identifying the gap symmetry and structure in the high - temperature ( high - t@xmath6 ) iron pnictide superconductors is an essential step towards understanding the origin of superconductivity in these systems,@xcite as well as understanding their relation to the high - t@xmath6 cuprates.@xcite    the electronic structure upon which superconductivity is built in the pnictides consists of hole ( @xmath0 ) bands centered at @xmath7 and electron ( @xmath1 ) bands centered at @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) .",
    "in many pnictide systems the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands are strongly nested leading to magnetic instabilities and superconductivity upon doping.@xcite this nested multiband structure opens up the possibility that a sign change in momentum space could take the form of an @xmath3 gap structure , with @xmath4 having a different sign on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands . to date",
    "there has been considerable progress in measuring the gap structures in iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors , @xcite including many that can discern different gaps associated with the multiple bands crossing fermi level , @xcite and a few that are sensitive to whether or not there is a sign change between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",

    "the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 show intraband scattering within the hole and electron pockets , respectively , while @xmath13 shows interband scattering between the two . in the @xmath3 scenario ,",
    "the sign of @xmath4 switches sign between the initial and final states of the @xmath13 scattering process . ]    in this context , lifeas has a particularly important place amongst the pnictides .",
    "it is superconducting at its stoichiometric composition , enabling studies of the superconducting state that are undisturbed by the disorder arising from chemical substitutions.@xcite furthermore , the system presents a natural cleavage plane between two adjacent li layers , which leads to stable , non - polar cleaved surfaces with a carrier density similar to that of the bulk.@xcite this makes lifeas an ideal system for surface sensitive probes such as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) , @xcite and well suited for studying the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in the iron pnictides .",
    "lifeas however differs from the other pnictides in some significant ways .",
    "the electronic structure of lifeas lacks the strong nesting conditions observed in other families , which is the likely reason for the absence of a magnetic phase.@xcite moreover , the underlying pairing symmetry in lifeas is under debate and it is unclear whether the nature of superconductivity in this material is the same as in the other pnictides .",
    "the lack of nesting between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pockets weakens the traditional argument for @xmath3 pairing .",
    "this , coupled with the observation of multiple dispersion renormalizations , has led to proposals for an @xmath14 pairing symmetry @xcite driven by phonon assisted orbital fluctuations .",
    "@xcite alternatively , proposals have been made for an exotic triplet pairing .",
    "for example , arpes indicates the presence of a van hove singularity at the top of the inner hole pockets,@xcite which can enhance ferromagnetic fluctuations and lead to a @xmath15-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "this is supported by a recent stm / sts study @xcite as well as theory based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and a two - dimensional ( 2d ) three - band model.@xcite however , nmr and @xmath16sr measurements on high purity lifeas samples do not show any signature of triplet pairing.@xcite in contrast , there are indications that an @xmath3 symmetry is realized in lifeas despite the lack of strong nesting between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands . from a theoretical point of view , both an early functional renormalization group study ( based on density functional theory ( dft ) bandstructure calculations ) @xcite and a more recent rpa study ( based on an arpes - derived bandstructure ) @xcite find a leading @xmath3 superconducting instability .",
    "this scenario also has experimental support from a number of indirect probes.@xcite    the presence of a spin resonance mode observed by inelastic neutron scattering is perhaps the strongest indirect evidence in support of the @xmath3 gap symmetry in lifeas.@xcite in general , a resonance peak occurs in the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility below t@xmath6 at wave vector * q * connecting portions of the fermi surface that have different signs for the superconducting gap . in lifeas ,",
    "a broad resonance mode is observed at an incommensurate wavevector close to the antiferromagnetic wavevector connecting the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands,@xcite consistent with an @xmath3 symmetry and similar to other pnictides.@xcite the observed energy scale @xmath17 is consistent with a modulation in lifeas s ldos,@xcite indicating that this mode may be related to the pairing glue.@xcite there are however open questions regarding this interpretation .",
    "first , the observed spin resonance is rather broad in comparison to the sharp ldos modulations.@xcite second , in the case of the high - t@xmath6 cuprates it was shown that a ldos modulation in the form of a dip - hump feature is indicative of a pair breaking mode within the eliashberg formalism.@xcite third , no corresponding feature has been observed in the arpes spectra as would be expected if the mode was coupling strongly to carriers . in light of these issues",
    "we conclude that while the existence of a resonance mode is indicative of a sign change in the order parameter , its role in establishing superconductivity is not fully understood and its presence can only be considered as circumstantial evidence for an @xmath3 pairing symmetry .",
    "given these open issues regarding the pairing symmetry in lifeas , it is desirable to have a direct , phase - sensitive measurement of the superconducting gap . here , we combine arpes , stm / sts , and multi - orbital scattering theory to study quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) in lifeas . using this coherent approach to determine the electronic structure , we identify the relevant scattering vectors for this system and show that the energy dependence of the qpi intensity behaves as expected for an @xmath3 superconductor with scattering from a non - magnetic potential impurity . in this way we provide direct , phase - sensitive proof for an @xmath3 symmetry of the superconducting gap .",

    "comparing to the selection rules in table [ tbl:1 ] , we find that the data is most consistent with an @xmath3 scenario with @xmath4 changing sign between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ; below the superconducting gap @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering intensities are suppressed while @xmath1-@xmath0 scattering intensities are enhanced for non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "magnetic impurities in the @xmath3 scenario have the opposite effect .",
    "the observed selection rules are also distinct from the @xmath14 scenario with either magnetic or non - magnetic impurities , see table [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "furthermore , by considering that knight shift decreases below @xmath151,@xcite we rule out the chiral p - wave state .",
    "our results indicate the non - magnetic nature of the most common defect .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the fe - d@xmath99 defect is most likely a li substitution on an fe site , or an fe vacancy,@xcite both of which are expected to be non - magnetic .",

    "a noise background signal is integrated in the grey rectangular area and subtracted . here",
    "the windows are shown in one quarter for simplicity but the integration is performed over the equivalent areas in all four quadrants of the image . ]",
    "we have examined qpi in lifeas using a combination of stm / sts , arpes , and a tight binding model . by anchoring our tight binding description of lifeas to the arpes - derived band dispersions we were able to unambiguously assign each of the scattering vectors in the qpi maps . in this framework , we have reconciled not only the discrepancies in the assignments of scattering vectors in prior qpi studies but also the disagreement on the sizes of inner hole pockets between arpes and stm techniques by recognizing a non - trivial @xmath2 dependence in the tunneling process . with",
    "the assignment of the scattering vectors made , we then examined the detailed variations of the qpi intensity as a function of bias voltage .",
    "the variations in intensity near the superconducting gap are only consistent with an @xmath3 pairing symmetry where the change in sign occurs between the electron and hole pockets .",
    "together with the observation of a spin fluctuation resonance by ins@xcite , this work presents a compelling evidence of unconventional @xmath3 pairing in lifeas driven by repulsive spin fluctuation interactions .",
    "this implies lifeas shares a common superconducting mechanism with the other members in the iron pnictide family.@xcite hence lifeas is a simple and clean model material for probing the common physics of iron pnictides .",
    "this work also demonstrates how bogoliubov qpi from defect / impurity scattering provides a direct phase sensitive measurement of superconducting pairing symmetry .",

    "bogoliubov qpi is measured ( without the application of a magnetic field ) by taking advantage of point defects / impurities inside the material , which has been proposed only theoretically.@xcite this method can be generalized to other superconductors , provided the nature ( magnetic vs nonmagnetic ) of the impurities are known .",

    "although there are obvious friedel oscillations around each defect , the fourier transformed image does not show a clear qpi pattern due to a dominant background signal centered at * _ q _ * = ( 0 , 0 ) . here , we employ two methods to remove this background and recover the underlying qpi patterns .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2]a , @xmath157 exhibits strong conductance peaks at the defect centers that give rise to a strong background signal in momentum space , overwhelming the qpi signal . in general",
    ", the tunneling conductance map @xmath158 is given by      where _ e _ is a unit charge , @xmath160 is the ldos at * r * , and _",

    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) the variation of @xmath162 is directly proportional to the variation of the ldos if the normalization @xmath163 is spatially homogeneous .",
    "this condition however , does not hold at the center of the defects when the defects strongly modify the local potential .",
    "this is because @xmath164 can be dramatically modified by local changes in the electronic structure and/or the creation of bound states .",
    "the ldos of lifeas is highly inhomogeneous near e@xmath165,@xcite so the defect - induced changes in the local electronic structure cause a significant variation in the integral of the ldos over the energy range @xmath166 $ ] . in addition , all common defects in lifeas generate bound states inside the superconducting gaps.@xcite therefore , the behavior of @xmath167 at defect centers can not be simply interpreted as friedel oscillations in @xmath164 due to the inhomogeneity of the normalization factor .",
    "a gaussian masking method is used to eliminate the signal from the central conductance peaks of these defects .",
    "for a defect located at @xmath168 , the masked conductance map @xmath169 is given by @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is a truncated gaussian function with the maximum value = 0.99 and @xmath172 is the standard deviation , taken to be approximately the half width of the defect center .",
    "this gaussian masking method suppresses the local conductance peaks associated with the defect centers yet preserves the sign of @xmath167 and produces a smooth transition from the masked regions to the qpi nearby .",
    "we apply the gaussian mask to each of the defects .",
    "[ fig : s2]c and [ fig : s2]d show the portion of the real space conductance map removed by the mask and its corresponding fourier transform , respectively .",
    "this demonstrates that the defect centers primary contribute a large background signal centered at * q * = ( 0 , 0 ) .",

    "significantly more symmetric and regular patterns stand out in momentum space .",
    "a small but high intensity ring is present in the center and is surrounded by a second less intense ring and a third larger ring .",
    "in addition , arc structures appear in the direction @xmath173 . in the analysis ,",
    "no symmetrization has been applied to the data .",
    "thus any feature satisfying the tetragonal crystal symmetry is real and originates from the underlying electronic structure .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2]f , the strong intensity around @xmath174 lowers the visibility of the qpi pattern at larger * q*. we therefore further applied the gaussian suppression method of allan _ et .",
    "al . _ ( ref . )",
    "to suppress the central peak : @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is a gaussian function with peak value = 1 and @xmath177 .",
    "we chose to retain 5% of the signal at @xmath174 in order to not overly suppress the real qpi signal near @xmath174 .",
    "[ fig : s2]g shows the final qpi map after applying both the gaussian mask in real space and gaussian suppression in momentum space .",
