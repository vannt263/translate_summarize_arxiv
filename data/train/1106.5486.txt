    "a great challenge in strong - interaction physics has been to relate high - energy scattering experiments to the state of the early universe .",
    "especially , ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions promise to create a state of hot and dense matter similar to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite which dominated the early universe approximately one microsecond after the big bang .",
    "the underlying hypothesis is that in nucleus - nucleus collisions at central rapidities a hot fireball is created with a temperature which is higher than the phase transition or cross - over temperature @xmath4{mev}$ ] from a hadronic gas to the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "note , in this fireball the longitudinal and transverse momenta are equilibrated .",
    "owing to the extended size of the nuclei and the large change in entropy between the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronic gas , the hot matter created in the collision has been considered as a macroscopic state which lives long enough to determine the main features of the collision .",
    "this scenario can in principle also be related to the rapidity distribution of the produced particles if a series of fireballs spread out along the rapidity axis @xcite is constructed .    in this letter",
    "we propose a different picture based mostly on experimental information .",
    "our goal is to describe the inclusive cross section of charged particles produced in proton - proton ( pp ) collisions @xmath5 on the basis of a statistical distribution function which maximizes the entropy of the produced partons given certain constraints .",
    "we consider the light - cone momenta of the partons with energies @xmath6 and longitudinal momenta @xmath7 relative to the light - cone momentum of the incoming proton with @xmath8 : @xmath9    on the basis of light - cone momentum conservation , we then determine the maximum - entropy distribution @xcite for a given transverse energy which we call light - cone plasma distribution .",
    "our approach aims at a macroscopic description of the very soft part of the multiplicity distribution in hadronic collisions using as little dynamical input as possible .",
    "we refer to the literature for microscopic calculations of rapidity distributions based on parton shower monte carlo event generators @xcite or based on unintegrated gluon distributions from saturation models @xcite .",
    "the light - cone plasma distribution is a new state of matter , different from the thermal quark - gluon plasma distribution in the early universe .",
    "it agrees rather well with data when we assume a gradual transition from partons to hadrons , i.e. , when we use parton / hadron duality to relate our model to the measured rapidity distributions .    in the following we consider symmetric collision partners and discuss the produced partons separately in the forward and backward hemisphere .",
    "we limit ourselves to gluons only , i.e. , to bose statistics .",
    "it is important to emphasize the light - cone property of the maximum - entropy distribution .",
    "the dynamics of collisions at high energies is governed by a light - cone hamiltonian which is boost invariant and determines wave functions depending on transverse momentum and light - cone fractions which label the eigenstates .",
    "the density matrix resulting after the collision can be built up from an incoherent mixture of such multi - parton states . without a boost invariant formulation",
    "one can not define a number density of partons since in each reference system it will be different . in the rest system of the proton the gluons will all sit in the strings holding the quarks together , whereas in fast - moving proton the virtual gluons materialize as partons carrying a sizable momentum fraction .",
    "light - cone physics has been very successful in determining hard exclusive processes in high - energy collisions @xcite .",
    "we think that it is also important to describe soft inclusive cross - sections via the maximum - entropy principle .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a theoretical motivation for the light - cone plasma distribution . in section 3",
    "we calculate the parameters of the light cone distributions for pp collisions at @xmath10{gev}$ ] and . in section 4",
    "we consider nucleus - nucleus collisions as a superposition of pp collisions where the mean transverse momentum of the partons is broadened .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a comparison of the entropy of the light - cone distribution and the conventional smeared fireball distribution .",
    "section 6 gives our conclusions .",
    "the multiplicity distribution for partons can be motivated from the maximum - entropy principle . for this purpose",
    "we have to find the phase space for a system of partons which move on the light cone .",
    "the entropy of the partonic system is then proportional to the logarithm of the integrated phase space .",
    "this entropy has finally to be maximized given certain constraints which take into account the conservation of light - cone momentum and the limited transverse energy produced in hadronic collisions .",
    "on the light cone , phase space includes the transverse spatial coordinate @xmath11 , the transverse momentum @xmath2 , the longitudinal light - cone momentum @xmath12 and the longitudinal spatial variable @xmath13 .",
    "these variables are handled like in conventional thermodynamics , i.e. , the phase space multiplied by the gluon degeneracy factor @xmath14 and divided by the planck constant @xmath15 gives the number of available quantum states @xmath16 : @xmath17 for high energies , feynman scaling is a good phenomenological concept , therefore we have multiplied and divided this expression by @xmath18 to obtain the light - cone momentum @xmath19 and the longitudinal light - cone distance @xmath20 which are canonically conjugate variables .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite to show the role of @xmath21 in the light cone hamiltonian of a meson built from a valence quark and antiquark .",
    "we further make the simplifying assumption that the distribution function and consequently the entropy are homogeneously distributed in transverse space .",
    "the integration over the @xmath11-coordinate can then be executed and gives the area @xmath22 .",
    "an estimate of the integral of the scaled light - cone distance @xmath23 is more subtle , since it is not independent on the rest of the variables .",
    "it has to be done separately for valence and sea partons .",
    "let us describe the fast - moving system by a lorentz - factor @xmath24 .",
    "then the valence quarks occupy a decreasing longitudinal extension @xmath25 whereas the extension of the sea partons remains fixed . consequently , the longitudinal distance for valence quarks scaled with the increasing light - cone momentum @xmath26 of the proton is constant and yields for @xmath27{gev}$ ] a factor of @xmath28 : @xmath29    for sea partons with @xmath30 the scaled distance diverges , cf .",
    "@xcite : @xmath31    we interpolate the @xmath1 dependence of these two limiting cases for the integral over the scaled distance in the following way : @xmath32 a possible pre - factor of @xmath33 can not be determined more accurately and has to be absorbed into the transverse area @xmath22 . the so motivated ansatz for the phase space on the light cone is crucial for all further derivations .",
    "it deviates from the flat measure by the factor @xmath33 : @xmath34    gluons are bosons ; therefore , they can occupy the phase - space cells in multiples .",
    "the binomial of the combined number of particles and states over the number of states gives the number of possibilities to distribute @xmath35 gluons , i.e. , bosons , on @xmath36 quantum states : @xmath37    the entropy of the system is defined by the logarithm of the phase space . in eq .",

    "the second constraint defines the total transverse energy released in the collision in the positive hemisphere .",
    "these constraints are added with lagrange parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 to the entropy above .",
    "these two constraints are sufficient to determine the @xmath44 dependence of the distribution function since we have fixed the distribution in coordinate space .",
    "the resulting functional @xmath45 can then be varied with respect to @xmath46 to obtain the maximum entropy density : @xmath47    by choosing the cell sizes small we convert the sums into integrals over the continuum variables @xmath48 and the discrete distribution @xmath46 becomes @xmath49 , the light - cone plasma distribution function @xmath50    the light - cone plasma distribution together with the measure generates a distribution for the lorentz - invariant yield of the form @xmath51 - 1}.\\ ] ]    this is the connection of the maximum - entropy distribution on the light cone with the semi - inclusive cross section .",
    "the factor @xmath52 has its origin in the transverse phase space cell @xmath53 .",
    "the distribution is consistent with the two constraints of light - cone momentum conservation and total transverse energy which have the following form in continuum variables .",
    "the @xmath1 integration is executed in one hemisphere in the cm system , where the partons released by the proton projectile or target respectively are to be found : @xmath54    the phenomenological description of the multiplicity distribution has three parameters @xmath22 , @xmath55 , and @xmath43 . the parameter @xmath55 plays the role of an effective transverse `` temperature '' .",
    "the `` softness '' @xmath43 is related to the mean @xmath1 . with increasing center - of - mass energies",
    "we expect that the effective transverse temperature @xmath55 and the softness @xmath43 increase : the collision becomes `` hotter '' and the particle distributions `` softer '' .",
    "the effective transverse temperature @xmath55 is calculated from the mean transverse momentum which is equal to the ratio of the transverse energy and multiplicity in one hemisphere : @xmath56 with @xmath57 for a given @xmath58 , @xmath55 , and @xmath43 the multiplicity is uniquely defined when the cut on the @xmath1 integration is taken as @xmath59 .",
    "we describe in the next section how this distribution fits the data .",
    "when we want to relate the theoretical distribution of the gluon plasma to multiplicities of produced particles we must apply a simplified form of parton - hadron duality .",
