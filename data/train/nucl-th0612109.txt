    "cluster aspect is known to be one of essential features in light nuclei .",
    "recently , various new types of cluster structure have been predicted and found in excited states of light stable nuclei as well as in light unstable nuclei . in case of @xmath7c ,",
    "it was known that 3@xmath9-cluster states develop in such excited states as the @xmath10(7.65 mev ) state .",
    "et al._@xcite proposed a new interpretation of the @xmath10 as a dilute gas state of weakly interacting 3 @xmath9 particles .",
    "it is challenging problem to answer the question whether or not such a cluster gas is the general feature which appears in other nuclear systems . in order to search for such the dilute cluster states , we studied the structure of excited states of @xmath0c and @xmath0b .    the present study has been motivated by the recent measurements of gamov - teller ( gt ) transitions @xmath0b@xmath11c@xmath12 with high energy resolutions@xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "the gt transition strengths to the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 states were separately measured , and the transition to the @xmath13 was found to be extremely weak compared with that to the @xmath14 and also with those to other low - lying states .",
    "abnormal features of the @xmath2 have been known also in the mirror nucleus @xmath0b .",
    "for example , the @xmath2 of @xmath0b has relatively weak @xmath1 transitions into the lower states compared with strong transitions among other low - lying states .",
    "another characteristic of the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) is the strong monopole transition observed by the recent experiments of the inelastic @xmath15 scattering , where similarities of the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) with the @xmath7c(@xmath10 ) were suggested@xcite . in the theoretical side , the structure of the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) state has been mysterious because this state can not be described by any models .",
    "no theoretical state can be assigned to the @xmath2 in shell model calculations@xcite nor cluster model calculations@xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that the @xmath2 of @xmath0b and @xmath0c may have an abnormal structure , and is a candidate of the dilute cluster state . on the other hand , the shell models succeeded to reproduce various properties of the low - lying negative - parity states with the excitation energy @xmath16 mev except for the @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it suggests the possible coexistence of cluster states and non - cluster states in @xmath0b and @xmath0c .    in this paper , we study the negative - parity states of @xmath0b and @xmath0c based on the theoretical calculations of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) .",
    "we apply the method of variation after spin - parity projections in the amd framework , which has been proved to be a powerful tool for studying excited states of light nuclei .",
    "we focus on the structure of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 around @xmath17 mev , and show the similarity of the excited states of @xmath0b with those of @xmath7c .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we briefly explain the theoretical method in [ sec : formulation ] , and then we show the calculated results comparing with the experimental data in [ sec : results ] . in [ sec : discuss ] , the structure of excited states of @xmath0b is discussed , and their similarity with @xmath7c is shown .",
    "finally , we give a summary in [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we perform the energy variation after spin parity projection(vap ) within the amd model space , as was done in the previous studies@xcite .",
    "the detailed formulation of the amd method for nuclear structure studies is described in @xcite . in particular , the formulation of the present calculations is basically the same as that described in @xcite .",
    "an amd wave function is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets ; @xmath18 where the @xmath19-th single - particle wave function is written by a product of spatial(@xmath20 ) , intrinsic spin(@xmath21 ) and isospin(@xmath22 ) wave functions as , @xmath23 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are represented by complex variational parameters , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the iso - spin function @xmath28 is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) .",
    "we use the fixed width parameter @xmath29 @xmath30 , which is chosen to be the optimum value for @xmath0b .",
    "accordingly , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath31 .    for the lowest @xmath32 state ,",
    "we vary the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath27(@xmath34 ) to minimize the energy expectation value of the hamiltonian , @xmath35 , for the spin - parity projected amd wave function ; @xmath36 . here , @xmath37 is the spin - parity projection operator .",
    "then we obtain the optimum solution of the parameter set ; @xmath38 for the lowest @xmath32 state .",
    "the solution @xmath39 for the @xmath40-th @xmath32 state are calculated by varying @xmath41 so as to minimize the energy of the wave function ; @xmath42 which is the orthogonal component to the lower states .    after the vap calculations of the @xmath43 states for various @xmath44 , @xmath40 and @xmath45",
    ", we obtained the optimum intrinsic states , @xmath46 , which approximately describe the corresponding @xmath43 states . in order to improve the wave functions , we superpose all the obtained amd wave functions .",
    "namely , we determine the final wave functions for the @xmath43 states as , @xmath47 are determined by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian and norm matrices . here",
    "the number of the independent amd wave functions , which are superposed in eq.[eq : diago ] , is that of the spin parity states @xmath48 calculated by the vap .",
    "we calculate the expectation values for various observables with the @xmath49 obtained after the diagonalization .",
    "we adopt the same effective nuclear interaction as those used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which consists of the central force , the spin - orbit force and the coulomb force .",
    "the interaction parameters are slightly modified from the previous ones for better reproduction of the energy levels of @xmath0b and @xmath0c .",
    "namely , the bartlett , heisenberg and majorana parameters in the mv1 force are chosen to be @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the strengths of the spin - orbit force are @xmath52 mev .",
    "the base amd wave functions are obtained by the vap for the ground and the excited states of @xmath0b .",
    "the number of the base amd wave functions in the present calculations are 17 .",
    "these independent amd wave functions are superposed to calculate the final wave functions . in the calculations of the @xmath0c",
    ", we assume the mirror symmetry of the base amd wave functions for simplicity .",
    "the coefficients of the base wave functions in the superposition are optimized for each system of @xmath0b and @xmath0c .",
    "the energy levels of the negative parity states in @xmath0b are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b11spe ] . in the results ,",
    "we obtain the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 at about @xmath53 mev .",
    "we can assign the obtained @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the observed @xmath2(@xmath54 mev ) and @xmath3(@xmath55 mev ) due to the good agreements of transition strengths between theory and experimental data as shown later , though the excitation energies are overestimated by the present calculations .",
    "cm    the gt transition strengths from the @xmath0b@xmath56 to @xmath0c@xmath12 , the @xmath1 and @xmath57 transition strengths in @xmath0b are shown in tables [ tab : bgt ] , [ tab : bm1 ] and [ tab : be2],respectively .",
    "the calculated values for these transitions are in good agreements with the observed values .",
    "the @xmath58 for the transitions to the @xmath0c@xmath59 and the @xmath0c@xmath60 at @xmath61 mev were recently measured by charge exchange reactions@xcite , and it was found that @xmath62b@xmath11c(@xmath2 ) ) is abnormally small while @xmath62b@xmath11c(@xmath3 ) ) is as large as those for other low - lying states of @xmath0c .",
    "the present result well describes the small @xmath58 for the @xmath2 state because it has a well developed @xmath63he cluster structure , and hence , the structure of the daughter state much differs from the normal structure of the parent state , @xmath0b@xmath56 . due to the same reason , the @xmath1 transitions from the @xmath0b@xmath64 to the low - lying states are generally weak compared with other @xmath1 transitions among the low - lying states . on the other hand , since the @xmath3 has no cluster structure , the @xmath58 for the @xmath0c@xmath65 and the @xmath66 for the @xmath0b@xmath65 are as large as those for the other low - lying states in the theoretical results .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental data .",
    "we also show the theoretical @xmath58 calculated by the no - core shell model(ncsm)@xcite in table [ tab : bgt ] .",
    "the strengths of the gt transitions to @xmath0c@xmath12 are reproduced also by ncsm except for the transition to the @xmath0c@xmath59 . in the ncsm",
    ", the @xmath2 can not be described because the limited model space in the shell model is not suitable to describe cluster states with the spatial development .    in the recent experiments of the inelastic @xmath15 scattering @xcite , it has been found that the iso - scalar monopole transition for @xmath67 is as strong as @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "the calculated strength for this inelastic transition is @xmath70 @xmath69 , which well agrees with the experimental data .    .",
    "[ tab : bgt ] comparison of the gt transition strengths , the binding energies , @xmath71-moments , @xmath72-moments and @xmath73 threshold between present results and the experimental data .",
    "the theoretical values obtained by the no - core shell model calculation with av8+tm(99 ) @xcite are also shown .",
    "the experimental data are taken from ref.@xcite . [",

    "cm    in order to give more quantitative discussions of the spatial development of clusters , we examine the expectation values of the harmonic oscillator(h.o . )",
    "quanta for protons and neutrons in table [ tab : rmsr ] . for the width parameters of the h.o .",
    ", we use the same width of the gaussian wave packets adopted in the amd wave function .",
    "the values @xmath74 are defined by subtracting the minimum oscillator quanta from the expectation values of the principal quantum number of h.o .",
    ", @xmath75 where @xmath76 is 3(4 ) and 4(4 ) for protons(neutrons ) of @xmath0b and @xmath7c , respectively .",
    "the expectation values of the oscillator quanta indicate the higher shell components in terms of the h.o . shell model .",
    "it is generally enhanced when the clustering spatially develops , because it necessarily increases the higher shell components . in the @xmath7c(@xmath10 ) and the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) , the large @xmath74 values are caused by the developed three - center cluster structure .",
    "such the higher shell components due to the cluster correlation in the developed cluster states can not be treated in the truncated space of shell model .",
    "this is the reason why the shell model calculations fail to describe the @xmath7c(@xmath10 ) and the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath74 values in the @xmath0b(@xmath77 ) are rather small compared with those of the @xmath2 .",
    "it means that the major component of the @xmath77 is the @xmath78 configuration . since it has a compact state with cluster cores as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dense ] , this state is interpreted to be almost the su(3)-limit cluster state .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) and the @xmath7c(@xmath10 ) has been suggested in ref.@xcite , where the multipole decomposition analysis of the inelastic @xmath15 scattering has been performed .",
    "the remarkable strengths of inelastic monopole transitions are the characteristics of these states .",
    "figure [ fig : form ] . shows the calculated electron form factor for the monopole transitions , @xmath7c(@xmath79 ) , @xmath0b(@xmath80 ) and @xmath0b(@xmath67 ) .",
    "the profile and the absolute value of the form factor are similar between the @xmath0b(@xmath67 ) and the @xmath7c(@xmath79 ) , while the form factor for the @xmath0b(@xmath80 ) is more than factor @xmath81 smaller .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental results of the @xmath15 scattering@xcite .",
    "cm    as mentioned above , we can see the developed cluster structure with dilute density in the @xmath0b@xmath64 as well as the @xmath7c@xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath7c@xmath8 is interpreted as a cluster gas state , where 3 @xmath9 clusters are rather freely moving@xcite . here `` a cluster gas '' means the well developed cluster state with dilute density , where the clusters are freely moving in terms of the weak coupling picture .",
    "such the gas - like nature is reflected not only in the dilute density but also in the fragmentation of the amplitudes in the amd model space .",
    "let us remind the reader that a base amd wave function is expressed by a slater determinant . if the cluster state is written by an amd wave function , it has a certain spatial configuration of the cluster centers like a single brink - type cluster wave function@xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "when the state has a cluster gas - like feature , its wave function is written by a superposition of various amd wave functions with different configurations of cluster centers .",
    "as a results , the cluster gas state is not dominated by a single amd wave function , but the amplitudes distribute in various base wave functions .",
    "actually in the @xmath7c(@xmath10 ) , the amplitude of the @xmath82 is reduced to about @xmath83 because of the cluster gas nature as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "similarly , in the case of @xmath0b@xmath64 , the amplitude of the dominant component is only @xmath83 , while those for the @xmath0b@xmath84 and @xmath0b@xmath85 are more than @xmath86 .",
    "this indicates the gas - like nature of @xmath87 cluster in the @xmath0b@xmath64 as well as the @xmath88 cluster in the @xmath7c@xmath8 .",
    "considering the smaller radius of the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) than the @xmath7c@xmath8 , the cluster gas - like nature in the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) is not so remarkable as that in the @xmath7c@xmath8 .",
    "we consider the reasons for the less gas - like nature in the @xmath0b(@xmath2 ) as follows .",
    "firstly , the inter - cluster potential is more attractive in the @xmath89 channel than the @xmath90 channel .",
    "this is already known in the comparison of the binding energy between @xmath91li and @xmath92be .",
    "the origin is that the repulsive pauli effect is smaller in the @xmath89 than the @xmath90 .",
    "second , from the natural extension of the the ground state properties of @xmath91li and @xmath92be it is expected that the triton motion may have the orbital angular - momentum @xmath93 while the motion of the @xmath9 clusters has @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath93 should be less favored to form a dilute cluster gas state than the @xmath94 .",
    "thirdly , it might be important that the symmetry of three clusters is not good in the @xmath87 system as the @xmath88 system .",
    "because of the symmetry of 3 @xmath9 orbits , the @xmath7c(@xmath10 ) state is understood as the @xmath9 condensate state as argued in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , it is not easy to define the bosonic behavior and to discuss the condensation in the @xmath87 system , which contains only two identical bosons .    in the stabilizing mechanism of the dilute cluster states ,",
    "one of the keys preventing the states from shrinking is the orthogonality to the compact states in the lower energy region . in both cases of @xmath7c and @xmath0b",
    ", there exist the lower states with the compact cluster components . in the higher cluster states ,",
    "the cluster distribution avoids the compact inner region and must spread out to satisfy the orthogonality to the lower states .",
    "it is interesting that the the number of the lower compact states is one(@xmath95 ) in @xmath7c and it is two(@xmath96,@xmath77 ) in case of @xmath0b , which is just the number of the low - lying states described by the @xmath78 configurations .",
    "this is the reason why the dilute cluster state appears in the _ third _ @xmath97 state in the @xmath0b system .",
    "the diluteness of the cluster states should be sensitive also to the relative energy against the threshold energy of the corresponding cluster channel . in the present results ,",
    "the threshold energy for the three - body cluster breakup is not reproduced . in order to check the dependence of the relative energy of the excited state to the threshold , we vary the relative energy by changing the interaction parameters , and found that the structure of the excited states are qualitatively unchanged .",
    "it means that the present results are not sensitive to the relative position of the threshold .",
    "it is because the present framework is a kind of bound state approximation .",
    "since the number of the base wave functions is limited , the long tail part of the inter - cluster motion may not be enough taken into account , and therefore the description of the detailed resonant behavior is insufficient in the present framework .",
    "in fact , the amd calculations give the smaller radius of the @xmath7c@xmath8 than that obtained by the @xmath88 cluster models .",
    "however , we should stress that the features of @xmath88 system obtained by the present method are qualitatively similar to those of the @xmath88-gcm calculations by uegaki _",
    "et al._@xcite , and also consistent with the @xmath88 model of orthogonal condition method(ocm ) with the complex scaling method(csm)@xcite where the resonant behavior was appropriately treated .",
    "it implies that the present results are useful for qualitative discussions , though the long tail part of the inter - cluster motion and its boundary conditions should be carefully treated for further quantitative study .",
    "we should comment that the loosely bound cluster states have been predicted by nishioka _",
    "et al . _ with a @xmath87-ocm cluster model@xcite .",
    "however , they could not assign the @xmath2 state because the reproduction of the energy spectra in the low - energy region was poor in the cluster model space .      in the ideal @xmath87 and @xmath88 cluster states , the expectation values of the squared total intrinsic",
    "spin for neutrons(@xmath98 ) should be zero , because spin - up and spin - down neutrons couple to be spin - zero pairs .",
    "in @xmath0b and @xmath7c , non - zero values of @xmath98 is caused by the component of the cluster breaking .",
    "we show the values of @xmath98 in @xmath0b and also those in @xmath7c in table [ tab : rmsr ] .",
    "the @xmath98 values are small in the cluster states such as the @xmath0b@xmath85 , @xmath0b@xmath64 and @xmath0b@xmath99 . while that of the @xmath0b@xmath56 is significantly large as @xmath100 due to the component of the @xmath101 sub - shell closure as well as that of the @xmath7c@xmath56 .",
    "an interesting point is the large value , @xmath102 , in the @xmath0b(@xmath3 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath3 state is characterized by the intrinsic spin excitation of neutrons within the @xmath103-shell .",
    "this feature well corresponds to the structure of the @xmath7c@xmath104 , which is assigned to the observed @xmath105 mev ) state . in the comparison of the experimental excitation energies between @xmath0b(@xmath3 ) and @xmath7c@xmath104 with the intrinsic spin excitation , it is interesting that the @xmath0b(@xmath106 mev ) appears in the low - energy region and almost degenerate with the cluster gas - like @xmath0b(@xmath2 , @xmath107 mev ) , while the @xmath7c@xmath108 mev ) exists at much higher excitation energy than the @xmath7c@xmath109 mev ) .",
    "it implies that the intrinsic spin excitation easily occurs in @xmath0b than the @xmath7c , and that the excitation energy of the intrinsic spin excitation is almost the same as that of the cluster excitation in @xmath0b .",
    "we studied the negative - parity states in @xmath0b and @xmath0c based on the theoretical calculations of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) .",
    "it is concluded that various types of cluster states appear in the excited states of @xmath0b and @xmath0c .",
    "recent experimental data of gt transition strengths for the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 states at @xmath61 mev are well reproduced by the cluster state and the non - cluster state , respectively .",
    "it was found that the excitation energy of the intrinsic spin excitation is almost the same as that of the cluster excitation in @xmath0b .",
    "we compared the cluster aspect in the excited states of @xmath0b with that of @xmath7c , and showed a good similarity between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 systems .",
    "we succeeded to describe the @xmath0b(@xmath110 mev ) and @xmath0c(@xmath111 mev ) states , which have not been reproduced by any other models .",
    "for the assignment of the theoretical states to the observed ones , it is essential to systematically describe the properties of the coexisting cluster and non - cluster states in @xmath0c and @xmath0b .",
    "one of the new revelations in the present work is that @xmath0c@xmath112 ) and @xmath0b@xmath112 ) are the well developed cluster states of @xmath63he and @xmath87 with dilute density , respectively .",
    "the features of these dilute cluster states in @xmath0c and @xmath0b are similar to those of the @xmath10 state of @xmath7c , which is understood to be a cluster gas of weakly interacting 3@xmath9 particles .",
    "since the present framework is a kind of bound state approximation , the description of resonant behavior is not sufficient .",
    "the boundary conditions of the inter - cluster motion should be taken into account more carefully in more detailed investigations of the developed cluster states .",
