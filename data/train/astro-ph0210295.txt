    "the extragalactic distance scale is based on a small number of calibrators , with cepheids being the most widely adopted , primarily due to the relative ease with which these objects may be identified and measured in distant galaxies .",
    "however , other distance indicators , such as red - clump and rr  lyrae stars , retain a critically important rle in verifying the cepheid distance scale . eclipsing , double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( esb2s ) not only provide a direct route to fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii , but also afford true _",
    "primary _ distance indicators if temperatures ( more precisely , surface fluxes ) can be assigned to the components .",
    "our experience with studies of galactic early - type binaries has shown us that , with care , distance moduli accurate to @xmath2  mag are attainable ( hilditch , harries & bell 1996 ; harries , hilditch & hill 1997 ; harries , hilditch & hill 1998 ) , a precision comparable to that obtained for individual cepheid variables .    distance determinations for esb2s require densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data ; such determinations have , therefore , traditionally been observationally demanding , typically requiring several nights of 4-m - class telescope time per object .",
    "two recent developments have allowed significant advances in this area as far as the magellanic clouds are concerned .",
    "first , one of the valuable legacies of the various microlensing surveys is a vast database of newly discovered eclipsing binaries , with well - defined ephemerides and well - sampled , high - quality , multicolour photometry ; the ogle survey alone has yielded over 1400 new eclipsing binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; udalski et al .",
    "secondly , multi - object fibre - fed spectrographs now allow data to be collected for many objects simultaneously . in this paper",
    "we report the first results of a programme intended to determine fundamental parameters of @xmath3100 massive binaries in the smc , by combining ogle photometry with spectroscopy obtained by using the 2df multi - object spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the magellanic clouds constitute a crucial rung in the ` distance ladder ' , but recent determinations of their distance moduli ( dmi ) have split between ` short ' and ` long ' scales ( dmi @xmath318.3 and @xmath318.5 for the lmc ; e.g. , cole 1998 ) .",
    "the earliest attempt to derive a dm for an individual esb2 in the smc was by howarth ( 1982 ) , who found a dm of 18.3 for the x - ray binary sk  160 , located in the wing of the smc ( @xmath30.3 mag closer than the main body of the smc according to caldwell & coulson 1986 ) .",
    "bell et al .",
    "( 1991 ) presented the first esb2-based dm for the smc itself , using hv  2226 to estimate a dm of @xmath4 .",
    "guinan and co - workers are currently undertaking a programme to study in detail individual b - star binaries in the lmc , using hst spectra to determine temperatures and reddenings simultaneously . to date , this work has led to distances to two objects , hv  2274 ( guinan et al .",
    "1998 ; ribas et al .",
    "2000 ) and hv  982 ( fitzpatrick et al .",
    "the dm found for hv  2274 ( @xmath5 ) appears to support the short distance scale to the clouds , but the dm of hv  982 found by fitzpatrick et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 18.50 ) is consistent with the long distance scale .",
    "re - analysis of the hv  2274 data by other authors has also resulted in larger dm estimates ( @xmath6 , nelson et al .",
    "2000 ; @xmath7 , groenewegen & salaris 2001 ) .",
    "the aims of our programme are to provide a reliable esb2-based distance estimate for the smc , and to determine masses , radii and temperatures for @xmath3200 stars .",
    "these data will be used to test low - metallicity stellar - evolution models for both single stars ( the detached systems ) and interacting binary systems ( the semi - detached and contact objects ) .",
    "the present paper is a first step in this direction .",
    "we summarize the selection criteria for the sample , and the spectroscopic observations , in section  [ obs_txt ] .",
    "we then describe the basic steps in the analysis , and tabulate our results for the first ten programme objects . finally , we report our initial distance estimate , and compare our result with work based on red - clump stars and the cepheid period  luminosity relation .",
    "we base our sample on the ogle database of smc eclipsing binaries ( udalski et al .",
    "the smc stellar population is of intrinsic interest as the most easily observed sample of low - metallicity objects , and the quality of the ogle photometry and astrometry is well suited to our project . to define the target sample ,",
    "two filters were initially applied to the ogle eclipsing - binary database : @xmath8 , to allow sufficient signal - to - noise on our faintest targets ( @xmath9 per wavelength sample ) ; and orbital period @xmath10d , to ensure adequate phase coverage for most targets in our first 5-night allocation of observing time .",
    "our spectroscopy was obtained with the 2df instrument , which is capable of securing up to 400 spectra simultaneously , using 200 fibre feeds to each of two spectrographs ( lewis et al .",
    "it has a 2@xmath11 field of view , and two substantially overlapping fields were therefore required to ensure complete coverage of the 2.5 square degree ogle region .",
    "the adopted field centres were 00@xmath1247@xmath1300@xmath14 @xmath1510@xmath1600@xmath17 ( j2000 , herein field  1 ) , and 01@xmath1800@xmath1300@xmath14@xmath1945@xmath1600@xmath17 ( field  2 ) .",
    "astrometry accurate to better than 0.5@xmath17 is essential for 2df observations , since the fibre diameter is only 2@xmath17 .",
    "we cross - correlated the ogle catalogue against supercosmos source lists and found good agreement in relative position , with a sub - arcsecond offset in right ascension and declination .",
    "we therefore used the ogle positions to assign the 2df fibre positions .",
    "fibre - allocation constraints ( such as fibre crossings and angular proximity of targets ) meant that a few stars in the filtered catalogue were unobservable .",
    "the final target list consists of 124 binaries , of which 69 were in the overlap region of the two fields .",
    "digitized sky survey ( dss ) images were examined to identify sky regions in these densely populated fields , and the sky positions manually allocated .",
    "bright ( @xmath20 ) fiducial , or guide , stars were selected from the full ogle catalogue , and dss images of the objects were again inspected to ensure that there were no blended or other close companions .",
    "the data were obtained in service mode by t.  bridges during the nights of 2001 sept .",
    "611 ( jds 2,452,15863 ) , with one test exposure of field  1 taken on sept .  5 ; the night of sept .",
    "7 was lost to cloud .",
    "integration times of 1800s were used for most target exposures , in seeing of typically 1.52 arcseconds . as each field contained fewer than 200 targets , only the better - performing of the 2df spectrographs was employed . a 1200b grating",
    "was used , providing a mean reciprocal dispersion of 1.1px@xmath21 , and a resolution of 2   ( 135 kms@xmath21 ) .",
    "the wavelength range of the data is 3855  to 4910 , a region which contains spectral lines suitable for both radial - velocity measurements and spectral typing in the classification regime of interest .",
    "arc and flatfield frames were obtained after each target exposure , along with offset sky frames ( which may be used to calibrate fibre throughput ) , and twilight - sky integrations .",
    "the 2dfdr package was used to reduce the data , with default settings ( lewis et al.2002 ) .",
    "twilight - sky observations were used to calibrate the system throughputs when possible .",
    "the final dataset comprises 32 exposures ( 16 per field ) , so each system has at least 16 orbital - phase points , with rather more than half the targets having 32 phase points .    for the present study we selected ten binaries on the basis of spectral signal - to - noise and coverage of quadrature phases ( the times of maximum radial - velocity separation , best constraining the orbital velocity amplitudes ) .",
    "the selected objects are listed in table  [ basic_param_tab ] , and examples of typical spectra are shown in figure  [ raw_spectra_fig ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the light2 code used for the light - curve analysis uses modified black - body fluxes in its calculations , and is accordingly not suitable for predicting stellar absolute magnitudes directly .",
    "we therefore took the best - fit parameters found by using light2 , and applied them to a separate synthesis code , shade ( howarth & wilson 1983 ) .",
    "this code incorporates essentially the same standard physics as light2 , but allows more freedom in the choice of model - atmosphere grids .",
    "fluxes are interpolated linearly in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in this case for grids sampled every 2kk , 0.5  dex .",
    "we converted from fluxes to magnitudes using the zero - point calibrations given by bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ; note that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 zero - points are transposed in their table  a2 ) .",
    "the procedure adopted was to match the mean radius of the primary , as determined using light2 , and its mean temperature ( assigned on the basis of spectral type ) , and thereby to compute its @xmath26-band flux at quadrature .",
    "the radius of the secondary was then set at the light2 value , and the temperature adjusted until the primary : secondary quadrature flux ratio matched that determined by the light - curve synthesis . since it is fundamentally the flux ratio , not the relative temperatures , which is determined in the light - curve synthesis , this is the most transparent and direct procedure for determining the secondary temperatures and absolute fluxes .",
    "the results on temperatures are included in table  [ light_curve_table ] ( where the errors on the secondary temperatures propagate from the intensity ratios , and are therefore _ internal _ errors ) , and the computed absolute magnitudes are given in table  [ absmag_tab ] .",
    "the secondary temperatures estimated from flux ratios may now be compared with the temperatures implied by the spectral types .    the secondary temperatures required to match the observed primary : secondary flux ratios appear systematically lower than the temperatures implied by the spectral types , by @xmath27kk ( @xmath28% s.d . ) on average .",
    "that is , the temperature differences between the primaries and secondaries as indicated by their spectral types are , on average , smaller than the temperature differences indicated by their surface - brightness ratios .",
    "obviously , a more ` compressed ' temperature scale than the adopted one ( i.e. , a scale in which the temperature difference between adjacent spectral types is smaller ) would exacerbate this problem .",
    "the simplest ( but not the only ) interpretation is that the secondaries line spectra indicate spectral classifications @xmath31 subtype earlier than do their @xmath26-band continuum fluxes .",
    "a possible explanation is that this is a consequence of the ` reflection effect ' , i.e. , that the outer , line - forming regions of the secondary atmospheres are heated by the incident radiation of the primary .",
    "interstellar reddening towards and within the smc has been considered by many authors , with a consensus that fairly small values of @xmath29 generally apply .",
    "older studies are summarized by mcnamara & feltz ( 1980 ) and by bessell ( 1991 ) , who advocate foreground ( and therefore minimum ) reddenings of @xmath30 and 0.05 , respectively .",
    "more recent work indicates reddenings of @xmath30.050.25 .",

    "1998 ) .    to investigate reddenings and extinctions to our targets , we assume that the intrinsic colours of galactic stars apply to our smc targets ( the differences in these colours between kurucz solar - metallicity and smc - metallicity models are negligible ) , and that the optical  near - ir extinction curve is also similar ( e.g. , feast & whitelock 1984 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ) .    in principle , we want to use the longest available wavelength baseline to determine reddenings ",
    "i.e. , @xmath31 . writing @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in order to show explicitly the dependence of extinction on these quantities , we then have @xmath34 unfortunately , although it is well established that galactic late - o / early - b near - main - sequence stars have @xmath35 ( fitzgerald 1970 ; ducati et al .",
    "2001 ) , the intrinsic @xmath36 colours are much more poorly determined",
    ". we therefore estimate @xmath37 for our stars from the ogle data by noting that @xmath38 finding @xmath39 ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 .",
    "this compares favourably with values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 reported by wegner ( 1994 ) and by ducati et al .",

    "note that by adopting the @xmath31 reddenings to determine the crucial quantity @xmath49 , we are not improving the external _ accuracy _ of the results ( which is established from the @xmath50 colours ) ; but that the internal _ precision _ is considerably improved by using more than a threefold increase in wavelength baseline .",
    "the mean reddening towards our targets is @xmath51 , with an s.d . of 0.03",

    "the mean difference is zero ( by construction ) , with an s.d .",
    "the previous sections describe our determinations of the calculated absolute @xmath26-magnitudes at quadratures ( section  [ metho_txt ] ) and @xmath26-band extinctions ( section  [ red_sec ] ) .",
    "combined with the observed @xmath26-band quadrature magnitudes , these data yield the true distance moduli directly .",
    "the quadrature magnitudes come from the normalizations of the light - curve models , and are included in table  [ basic_param_tab ] ; the distance moduli are given in table  [ absmag_tab ] .",
    "the average true distance modulus to our targets , for the adopted temperature scale , is found to be @xmath54 ( s.d .",
    "; error on the mean 0.04 ) .",
    "although we can determine the distances to our targets with reasonable precision , we need to consider their location within the smc in order to derive ` the ' distance .",
    "the dynamics and structure of the smc are complex , probably as a result of interaction with the lmc ( murai & fujimoto 1980 ; gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) , and that structure is , arguably , still not completely clear .",
    "caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) , laney & stobie ( 1986 ) , and mathewson et al . ( 1988 ) found line - of - sight depths of @xmath320  kpc , while welch et al .",
    "( 1987 ) concluded that the dispersion of the cepheid period ",
    "luminosity(colour ) relation corresponds to a depth of only 3.3kpc ; martin , maurice & lequeux ( 1989 ) similarly concluded that most of the young population lie within a band less than 10kpc deep , as did crowl et al .",
    "gardiner , hatzidimitriou , hawkins , and collaborators have conducted a complementary series of studies of the outer regions of the smc ( e.g. , hatzidimitriou , cannon & hawkins 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "part of the discrepancy between different papers appears to arise because of different interpretation of what ` the ' depth actually means .",
    "our digest of published work is that the bulk of the young populations at the centre of the smc have a line of sight depth of less than 10kpc ; the main body of the bar is closer in the ne and more distant in the sw , by @xmath30.2 mag in distance modulus ( mathewson et al .  1988 ; gardiner & hawkins 1991 ) .",
    "our target fields are less than 1@xmath11 from the optical and dynamical centres of the smc .",
    "the distance we find for our targets should therefore be directly representative of the mean distance of the smc .",
    "moreover , the modest line - of - sight depth at this location means that our sample should not be significantly biased towards near - side objects ( intrinsic luminosity , and variable transmission through the 2df fibre feeds , will be more important in determining which targets have good s : n than will fore - and - aft location within the cloud ) .",
    "our distances are formally consistent with all targets lying at a common distance",
    ". however , the two targets 5  202153 and 7  243913 are distance outliers in the distribution , and hint at a real depth effect , although their radial velocities , which might be expected to reflect any distinct dynamical properties , are unexceptional ( table  [ rv_tab ] ) .",
    "their discrepant distances can not result directly from the surface - brightness calibration , as these systems have spectral types which fall in the main grouping of targets .",
    "finally , we note that our internal error estimates , discussed below , are commensurate with the dispersion in distances to individual systems , which provides the ultimate validation of our procedures .",
    "since reddenings are generally small , extinction is unlikely to be an important source of systematic error ; for example , the sensitivity of true distance modulus to @xmath55 , the ratio of selective to total extinction , is @xmath56 at @xmath26 .",
    "for smc ( internal ) reddening of @xmath57 , which is at the upper end of the range found for our targets , even a systematic error in @xmath55 as large as 0.5 ( the extreme range of results given by gordon & clayton 1998 ) would change the true distance modulus by only 0.05 .",
    "individual @xmath29 reddening estimates are unlikely to be _ systematically _ in error unless smc stars of a given spectral type have significantly different intrinsic colours to their galactic counterparts .",
    "model - atmosphere calculations , and observations , provide no indication that this is the case .",
    "the flux calibration of the magnitude scale ( a source of systematic error which affects all photometrically - based distance estimates ) is uncertain at the @xmath58%  level .",
    "potentially , our most important source of systematic error is the adopted temperature  spectral - type scale ( and the associated relationship between surface brightness and effective temperature ) .",
    "the spread in temperature scales is @xmath312kk for late - o to early - b types , which provides some guidance to the magnitude of systemetic errors in this factor ( although consistency may be a poor guide to correctness ) . for every 1kk change in @xmath59 ,",
    "there is a @xmath37%  change in surface brightness , or a @xmath33%  change in distance @xmath60 ( 0.06 mag in distance modulus ) .    considering these factors ,",
    "a reasonable estimate of the maximum systematic error in the mean distance modulus from our ( ultimately large ) sample is @xmath30.1 .",
    "a hotter temperature scale would lead to an increased distance estimate , as would ( to a lesser extent ) a decrease in the smc value of @xmath55 .      by random errors we mean the statistical uncertainty on the estimated distance to a single system .",
    "this uncertainty results from errors on the stellar radii ; temperatures ; and reddenings .",
    "since we essentially measure an angular diameter , errors on the radii correlate directly with errors on distance .",
    "these errors are explicitly considered in the errors quoted in table  [ light_curve_table ] ; a typical @xmath34%  uncertainty in radius @xmath61 corresponds to an equal uncertainty in @xmath60 .",
    "the spectral classifications of the primaries are estimated to be good to @xmath31 subtype ; at o9-b0.5 , this corresponds to an error of @xmath62kk in @xmath59 which , as noted above , corresponds to a @xmath35%  error in distance .",
    "the observational determination of quadrature magnitudes is not a significant source of error ( the light - curve normalizations are good at the millimagnitude level ) .",
    "finally , an error of 0.02 m in @xmath29 corresponds to an error of 0.06 in distance modulus , or 3%  in @xmath60 .    adding these factors in quadrature",
