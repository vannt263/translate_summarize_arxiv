    "now define a boundary operator @xmath125 by setting @xmath126 witten @xcite was the first to explicitly formulate morse theory in this way ; he showed that @xmath127 _ is _ a boundary operator , namely @xmath128 , and that @xmath129 is the homology of the complex @xmath130 .",

    "he observes that if @xmath132 and if @xmath77 is a generic component of the moment map , then @xmath77 is a morse function with critical points all of even index , so ( [ 1 ] ) is a special case of ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "this recipe for computing homology also works in characteristic two ; however , when @xmath25 symmetries are present , the gradient curves joining the points @xmath122 to the points on the list ( [ 15 ] ) often occur in pairs .",

    "since this commutes with the product action , it induces a hamiltonian action of @xmath104 on @xmath151 .",

    "we will say two solutions are identical if they satisfy ( [ eq:8.2 ] ) .",
    "note , by the way , that ( [ eq:8.2 ] ) can be rewritten @xmath491 hence , we have defined an equivalence relation .",
    "one can inject an element of randomness into this problem by positing that , for @xmath492 , @xmath493 in other words , either the symmetric difference is given by ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) or @xmath494 .",
    "again , the problem is to list all possibilities for the @xmath485 s .",
    "clearly , the solutions of ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) contain the solutions to ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) ; so by solving ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) , one gets an upper bound on the number of solutions to ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , there are a lot of trivial solutions of ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) , namely , @xmath495 where @xmath487 is , as above , a fixed subset of @xmath391 .",
    "these can immediately be discarded as potential solutions of ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) .",
    "there is an elegant way of reformulating ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) in the language of @xmath496 arithmetic .",
    "let @xmath50 be the graph whose vertices are the @xmath481 s and whose edges are the members of @xmath166 . for every edge @xmath489 ,",
    "let @xmath497 be the element of @xmath498 whose @xmath159th coordinate is @xmath331 if and only if @xmath499 and @xmath292 the element of @xmath498 whose @xmath159th coordinate is @xmath331 if and only if @xmath500 . then ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath501 and ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath502 in particular , ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) becomes an identity of the type described in theorem  [ th : realgkm ] , the multiple of @xmath497 on the right being in the degree zero component of @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "now let @xmath0 be a gkm manifold acted on by an @xmath1-torus @xmath503 , and let @xmath50 be its associated graph .",
    "if the @xmath497 s in ( [ eq:8.6 ] ) are the weights of @xmath24 which were defined in theorem  [ th : realgkm ] the results of section  [ se : realgkm ] tell us that solutions of ( [ eq:8.6 ] ) can be identified with elements of @xmath504 we will use this observation to determine the solutions of ( [ eq:8.6 ] ) in a couple simple , but interesting , examples .     * the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices . *",
    "consider @xmath505 as a @xmath104 manifold ( ignoring the fact that the diagonal subgroup of @xmath104 acts trivially ) .",
    "the corresponding graph is the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices : its vertices are @xmath506 and every pair of vertices is joined by an edge .",
    "the weights @xmath507 from theorem  [ th : realgkm ] are just @xmath508 , so the conditions ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) become @xmath509 the solutions of ( [ eq:8.7 ] ) are in one to one correspondence with the elements of @xmath510 or , alternatively , of @xmath511 the elements of the first summand correspond to the trivial solutions of ( [ eq:8.7 ] ) .",
    "so if we identify solutions which are equivalent in the sense of ( [ eq:8.2 ] ) , the non - trivial solutions of ( [ eq:8.7 ] ) correspond to non - zero elements of @xmath512 .",
    "however , @xmath513 , so there is just one non - trivial solution up to equivalence , and it is given by @xmath514 this is also the unique solution of ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) up to equivalence .    * the permutahedron .",
    "* let @xmath0 be the complex flag variety @xmath515 , and consider the @xmath104 action on @xmath0 by left multiplication .",
    "the graph associated with @xmath0 is the _",
    "permutahedron_. its vertices are the elements of the symmetric group , @xmath105 , and two vertices @xmath3 and @xmath7 are joined by and edge if @xmath106 is a transposition .",
    "if @xmath312 is the edge joining @xmath3 to @xmath7 and @xmath106 is the transposition switching @xmath103 and @xmath516 , then as in the previous example , @xmath517 , so the conditions ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) become @xmath518 as in the previous example , the non - trivial solutions to ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) can be identified with the non - zero elements of @xmath519 , and since @xmath520 is the real flag variety , @xmath521 if one thinks of @xmath522 as the quotient of @xmath498 by the diagonal subgroup @xmath523 with @xmath524 , the solutions corresponding to @xmath525 is given by @xmath526 where @xmath527 if and only if the @xmath159th coordinate of @xmath197 is @xmath331 .",
    "notice , by they way , if we replace @xmath197 by @xmath528 , ( [ eq:8.11 ] ) becomes @xmath529 where @xmath530 and @xmath531 are the complements of @xmath107 and @xmath487 in @xmath391 , so ( [ eq:8.11 ] ) and ( [ eq:8.12 ] ) are equivalent .",
    "it is easy to see by inspection that none of the solutions ( [ eq:8.11 ] ) of ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) are also solutions of ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) .    an interesting special case of this example is the complete bipartite graph @xmath532 . in this case , the vertices of @xmath50 are @xmath533 , @xmath534 , @xmath535 and @xmath536 , @xmath537 , and @xmath538 ; the edges are all pairs @xmath539 ; and the sets @xmath490 are @xmath540 in this example , ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) has one non - trivial solution , up to equivalence , namely @xmath541 ."
