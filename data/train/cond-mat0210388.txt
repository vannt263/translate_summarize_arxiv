    "atomically layered superconductors , such as bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bscco ) , behave as stacks of josephson junctions .",
    "this so - called intrinsic josephson effect has been a subject of intense research in the past decade ( see reviews @xcite ) . in spite of atomic - size separation between the neighboring junctions , in zero magnetic field",
    "the system approximately behaves like an array of independent junctions .",
    "a weak dynamic interaction between the neighboring junctions appears due to nonequilibrium effects @xcite .",
    "situation is very different in the magnetic field applied along the layer direction , which generates the josephson vortex lattice .",
    "recently , dynamic properties of this lattice in bscco have been subject of extensive experimental research @xcite . at high fields ( above 0.5 tesla for bscco )",
    "the josephson vortices homogeneously fill all layers @xcite ( dense josephson vortex lattice , see fig.[fig - denselatphdiag ] ) .",
    "josephson vortex arrays in neighboring layers have strong inductive interaction @xcite , which strongly influences static and dynamic properties of the lattice . due to this interaction",
    "the magnetic properties of the stack are very different from the magnetic properties of an isolated junction .",
    "[ ptb ]   and the period of layered structure @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is focused on the long - stack / dense lattice regime in the upper right part of the diagram.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a transport current flowing across the layers exerts a lorentz force on the josephson vortices along the layer direction .",
    "an important parameter is the _",
    "critical current _",
    "above which the lattice starts to move producing a finite voltage .",
    "this current is determined either by bulk pinning or by interaction with the boundaries . in this paper",
    "we consider the case of a homogeneous junctions and neglect bulk pinning .",
    "the simplest and most known case is a single small josephson junction without inhomogeneities , where the field dependence of the critical current is given by the fraunhofer dependence , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the magnetic flux through the junction .",
    "observation of this dependence has been considered as an important confirmation of the _ dc _ josephson effect . at present , the fraunhofer field dependence is routinely used as an indicator of the junction homogeneity .",
    "the same dependence is also expected for the junction stack with the lateral size smaller than the josephson length @xcite . in a single long junction",
    "the field dependence of the critical current has rather complicated structure due to multiple coexistent states of the lattice @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the critical current and lattice structure near boundaries at high magnetic fields in the regime of dense lattice in the stack of josephson junctions . in this regime",
    "the josephson coupling can be treated as a small perturbation , which allows to develop a full analytical description of this system .",
    "another important simplification is that at high fields one can neglect the current self - field and neglect the difference between the magnetic field inside the junction and the external applied magnetic field .",
    "we find that the boundary induces an alternating deformation of the lattice .",
    "averaging out the rapid phase oscillations , we derive that the lattice deformation obeys the sine - gordon equation .",
    "the deformation decays inside superconductor at the typical length @xmath7 , which is larger than the josephson length and increases proportional to the magnetic field , @xmath8 .",
    "structure of the surface deformation and the total current flowing along the surface is uniquely determined by the lattice position far away from the boundary .",
    "the total current flowing through the stack is given by the sum of two independent surface currents flowing at the edges of the sample .",
    "due to the commensurability effects , the maximum current through the stack has oscillating field dependence , which resembles the fraunhofer dependence : it has strong oscillations and overall @xmath1 dependence .",
    "however , the period of these oscillations corresponds to adding _ one flux quantum per two junctions_.    we also calculate the flux - flow voltage for the josephson vortex lattice slowly moving through a finite stack . due to the interaction with the boundaries",
    "this voltage also has an oscillating contribution with period one flux quantum per two junctions .",
    "recently , such oscillations have been observed in bscco mesas @xcite , and also were seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we find that the oscillating voltage normalized to the bare flux - flow voltage has universal dependence on the magnetic flux per one junction and the current density normalized to the josephson current density . at high currents the relative amplitude of voltage oscillations decreases with current and field as @xmath9 .",
    "we also show that in the case of dominating in - plane dissipation , typical for bscco , the _ absolute _ amplitude of voltage oscillations weakly depends on magnetic field in a wide field range , in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the new length scale @xmath7 increasing with the magnetic field also sets the new field scale @xmath10 , at which this length becomes of the order of the junction length @xmath11 . above this field",
    "the system crosses over to the regime of small junction and the field dependence of the critical current crosses over to the usual fraunhofer dependence .",
