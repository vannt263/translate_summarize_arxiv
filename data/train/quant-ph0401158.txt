    ". furthermore , control of the internal molecular quantum state could be achieved  @xcite , for eventually enhancing chemical reactions .    besides these applications of pulsed fields , also interactions with cw laser fields or static fields reveal interesting effects .",

    "they are infrared inactive and thus their rotation is essentially undamped and isolated from the electromagnetic vacuum .",
    "clearly this does not hold for the internuclear vibration and , in addition , the rotational statistics determines via ro - vibrational coupling its relaxation and decoherence properties  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a permanent dipole moment being absent , non - polar molecules still can be polarised by electrical fields and thus feel an effective alignment force when an anisotropic polarisability prevails .",

    "@xcite became a major focus of research in recent years .",
    "given the ultra - low temperatures of a condensed atomic or possibly molecular gas , the molecular rotation , representing the lowest energy scale apart from centre - of - mass motion , then should play an important role . for sufficiently cold molecules one might expect decoherence first to appear on the rotational energy scale before affecting the energetically higher degrees of freedom , such as the internuclear vibration .",
    "moreover , the molecular rotation provides a toolbox for implementing various textbook examples of mechanics , such as spherical pendula and the motion of rigid bodies .",
    "in particular , we will focus here on homonuclear , diatomic molecules in a far - detuned linear - polarised laser field .",
    "this is a setup relevant also for trapping of photo - associated ultra - cold molecules in a dipole trap  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] a brief review is given on the classical description of the motion of the molecular axis .",

    "have been shown to produce a similar interaction  @xcite . in this way one can take advantage of large polarisabilities of non - polar molecules to attain deep potential wells for the nutation angle .",

    "however , the relative rate of spontaneous vs stimulated raman transitions , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 being the bare electronic linewidth of the dipole transition , shows that even for large detuning , @xmath54 , a certain number of spontaneous processes occur .",
    "these processes not only lead to an incoherent effect on the molecular rotation , such as relaxation and quantum decoherence , but also excite the internuclear vibration via franck  condon transitions .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the laser remains detuned from resonant vibronic transitions , the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom can be eliminated to obtain equations of motion for the molecular rotation alone .",
    "this is achieved by consistently eliminating the electronic coherences and electronic excited - state populations , keeping only terms up to second order in the molecule - light interaction . in franck ",
    "condon approximation the vibrational degree of freedom can then be traced over  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of avoiding resonant vibronic transitions leads to a maximum interaction time on which the molecule stays vibrationally sufficiently cold , which can be estimated as @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the raman rabi frequency with @xmath57 being the electric - dipole matrix element between electronic ground and excited states .",

    "in the same way as the angular - momentum coherent states are a generalisation of the familiar harmonic - oscillator coherent states , also the concept of phase - space quasi - probability distributions can be defined on the angular - momentum phase space  @xcite . here",
    "we employ a wigner function , which in the @xmath103-dimensional hilbert space of angular momentum @xmath104 , is defined in terms of the density operator @xmath66 and the spherical harmonics , @xmath105 , as defined in refs  @xcite @xmath106 the multipole operators are defined by @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the wigner 3j symbol . the factor in front of eq .",

    "completed half and full cycles ( at @xmath123 and @xmath118 ) , when also the wigner function of the time - evolved coherent state shows relative strong negative regions , one observes that these negativities have become weaker in the presence of spontaneous emission .",

    "that the coherent state in this example actually is much more sensitive to decoherence may seem counter - intuitive at first sight , but one should keep in mind that the angular - momentum coherent state is not classical in the usual sense of a harmonic - oscillator coherent state .",
    "that is , as has been seen above its wigner function in general is not positive everywhere .",
    "furthermore , angular - momentum coherent states apparently are not in general the most robust states against decoherence , as are harmonic oscillator coherent states for linearly coupled reservoirs .",
    "the substantial difference in how these two cases are affected by decoherence due to spontaneous processes can also be observed in fig .",
