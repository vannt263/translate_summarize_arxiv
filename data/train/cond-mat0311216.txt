    "wetting in complex geometries and on rough surfaces provides a wealth of fascinating non - linear hydrodynamics problems , as well as being of commercial importance in numerous industrial sectors .",
    "perhaps the first kind of problem to be considered was the penetration of liquid into porous materials , where washburn in 1921 demonstrated that the distance attained by the wetting front follows a @xmath4 law where @xmath1 is time @xcite .",
    "much later the spreading of droplets on flat surfaces was addressed by various workers , such as tanner @xcite and lopez _ et al _",
    "@xcite , although it took some time for the subtleties of the physics at the wetting front to be resolved @xcite . generally , the wetting front advances with a @xmath5 law where @xmath6 is a small exponent which depends on the geometry of spreading and the origin of the driving force .",
    "for example , @xmath7 for a drop spreading radially driven by surface tension ( tanner s law ) , and @xmath8 for a droplet spreading radially driven by gravity ( see oron _",
    "@xcite for a summary of results ) .",
    "the kinetics of wetting on rough surfaces has also been investigated experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "a paradigm for this problem is the spreading of a liquid in a wedge or v - shaped groove @xcite ; indeed wetting in a network of v - shaped grooves has been invoked recently for oil spreading on skin @xcite .",
    "another kind of problem that has been considered is the wetting of hydrophilic strips @xcite , as an example of wetting in a controlled microstructure that might be contemplated in a microfluidic device . in all these problems ,",
    "a @xmath4 spreading law has been observed , but in the cases considered thus far , there has been a reservoir which provides liquid at essentially a constant pressure . in the present paper , the problems of spreading in a wedge , in a network of v - shaped grooves , and on a hydrophilic strip are revisited .",
    "it is found that in the absence of a reservoir , the spreading law changes to @xmath5 with @xmath9 , similar to tanner s law and related problems .",
    "these problems are first approached by scaling arguments developed in the next section .",
    "the _ bona fides _ of the scaling arguments is established by rederiving some known results for spreading on flat surfaces . in a further section ,",
    "the scaling exponents are recovered by similarity analysis on the underlying partial differential equations which govern spreading .",
    "this also allows the scaling shape of the spreading drops to be computed .",
    "the washburn problem of a liquid being drawn into a capillary tube of internal dimension @xmath10 shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram](a ) is considered first @xcite .",
    "this is a model for penetration of liquid into a porous material for which @xmath10 interpreted as a mean pore size .",
    "the arguments here are very familiar , but form the basis for the more complex problems considered below .",
    "once the liquid has penetrated a sufficient distance @xmath11 , a poiseuille law obtains for the liquid velocity and the penetration rate , thus @xmath12 where @xmath13 is viscosity , and the pressure drop @xmath14 is due to the surface tension @xmath15 of the curved surface at the wetting front , at a mean curvature @xmath16 .",
    "all geometric factors associated with the shape of the tube and a finite contact angle have been dropped , although a contact angle @xmath17 is required for imbibition to take place .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ wash1 ] ) and ( [ wash2 ] ) gives @xmath18 which integrates to @xmath19 this is the simplest form of the washburn equation @xcite .",
    "the result arises from a constant pressure drop acting over an increasing length of liquid , which responds by flowing according to the poiseuille law . as we shall see below",
    ", this can be the case for many situations where a reservoir of liquid is present , but if a reservoir is absent , the rate of spreading can be much slower .",
    "next , the problem of a drop of liquid spreading on a flat surface is considered , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](b ) .",
    "usually the problem is approached by an appeal to the hydrodynamics in the vicinity of the moving contact line @xcite , but it can be analysed using similar concepts to the washburn problem . whilst only previously known results are recovered",
    ", the approach serves to illustrate further the arguments that will be used for the other problems .",
    "consider a drop of liquid spreading on a flat surface , in the case of complete wetting .",
    "let a measure of the radius of the spreading drop be @xmath20 and the height in the centre be @xmath21 . in the lubrication approximation , assuming a scaling shape of the droplet",
    ", all velocities will be proportional to @xmath22 ( compare poiseuille law above ) where @xmath23 is the pressure drop between the centre and the radius @xmath20 .",
    "in particular the drop radius is expanding at a rate @xmath24 first consider the capillary spreading case where the pressure gradient is due to surface tension @xmath15 .",
    "simple geometry shows that the mean curvature at the centre of the droplet for @xmath25 is @xmath26 therefore the pressure drop is @xmath27 and hence @xmath28 if @xmath21 were to be constant , as in the washburn problem , this would be enough to determine the spreading rate . here , though , a second relation connecting @xmath20 and @xmath21 must be sought .",
    "the desired relation follows from the conservation of drop volume @xmath0 , @xmath29 thus @xmath30 which integrates to @xmath31 this result is tanner s law @xcite .",
    "the basic scaling @xmath32 is well documented and has been experimentally verified @xcite .    for the case where the spreading is driven by gravity , one has @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass density and @xmath35 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "following the same line of argument as above , one obtains @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the behaviour crosses over from capillary spreading to gravity spreading when the bond number @xmath37 increases .",
    "since @xmath20 is increasing , this means that capillary spreading always crosses over to gravity spreading if one waits long enough .",
    "the weak increase in spreading rate has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "another case that can be considered is planar or one - dimensional spreading .",
    "the only thing which changes is the volume conservation law which becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 replaces @xmath20 as the measure of extent of spreading , and @xmath0 is a volume per unit length .",
    "this yields @xmath40 and @xmath41 for capillary @xcite and gravity @xcite spreading respectively .    ]    in the next problem , exactly analogous arguments are applied to the case of spreading in a wedge , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](c ) . in the case of spreading from a reservoir",
    ", this problem has been addressed by romero and yost @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that one has scale invariance , with the depth @xmath21 of fluid being the only relevant length scale .",
    "hence the transverse curvature of the interface @xmath42 . thus , provided the droplet has become sufficiently extended so that the contribution of the longuitudinal curvature to the mean curvature can be neglected , the pressure @xmath43 where the negative sign obtains if the surface is convex into the liquid .",
    "this is the case if @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the contact angle and @xmath46 is the wedge angle as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](c ) . in this case",
    ", the pressure becomes more negative as the amount of fluid is in the wedge gets smaller .",
    "this provides a pressure gradient which drives the liquid from regions of high loading to low loading .    even though the liquid has a free surface , a poiseuille - like law obtains , @xmath47 where @xmath39 is a measure of the extent of spread of the liquid drop .",
    "the pressure drop follows from the above arguments , @xmath48 , and therefore @xmath49 in perfect analogy to eq .",
    "( [ wash3 ] ) in the washburn problem .",
    "the difference here is that @xmath21 is a dynamic variable which , similar to the tanner s law derivation above , is found by a volume conservation law . in this case @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the cross section area occupied by the liquid , and @xmath0 is the volume of liquid . thus @xmath52 . substituting into eq .",
    "( [ wedge2 ] ) results in @xmath53 which integrates to @xmath54 this spreading law , @xmath55 , is a new prediction .",
    "it can also be recovered by a more detailed analysis of the underlying partial diffential equations which will be given in a later section .",
    "note that if the liquid had been spreading along the wedge from a reservoir , this would correspond to @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to the washburn result @xmath57 and is the origin of the scaling law obtained by previous workers @xcite .",
    "the next case to be considered is the problem of a droplet spreading into a network of grooves .",
    "this has also been considered by various groups @xcite .",
    "if spreading occurs from a reservoir , then the front advances with a @xmath4 washburn - like law .",
    "however the case where the liquid is completely confined in the grooves is different .",
    "the scaling law in this case follows from arguments similar to those already applied to a drop spreading in a wedge .",
    "the analysis assumes that the grooves are rather sparse on the surface , in particular that the volume of liquid in the junction zones can be neglected compared to the volume contained in the grooves .",
    "consider therefore a drop of liquid spreading in a sparse random network of grooves .",
    "it will spread essentially radially .",
    "suppose that the groove cross section is a v - shape , so that both the capillary pressure and the poiseuille scaling laws can be taken over from the case of spreading in a wedge .",
    "the fact that the grooves are randomly inclined with respect to the radial pressure gradient only introduces an additional numerical prefactor @xcite . thus eq .",
    "( [ wedge2 ] ) above still holds ( with @xmath39 replaced by @xmath20 ) .",
    "what changes is the volume conservation law : as @xmath20 increases , more grooves become filled . if the length of grooves per unit area is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a characteristic groove spacing on the surface , the total length of grooves occupied by the liquid @xmath60 and the volume @xmath61 . eliminating @xmath21 between this and eq .",
    "( [ wedge2 ] ) ( with @xmath39 replaced by @xmath20 ) gives @xmath62 .",
    "this integrates to @xmath63 the basic prediction therefore is that the spreading rate should slow from the @xmath4 washburn - like law for spreading from a reservoir , to an @xmath64 law as the liquid becomes confined to the grooves .",
    "the result is confirmed by a more detailed analysis of the underlying partial differential equations given later .",
    "the final problem that is considered is spreading along a hydrophilic strip , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](d ) .",
    "the case where spreading occurs from a reservoir has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally , and it is found that the spreading front advances with a washburn - like @xmath4 law @xcite . the situation in the absence of a reservoir",
    "was not investigated though .",
    "once again , the absence of a reservoir leads to a slower rate of spreading , and the scaling law can be determined using analogous arguments to those applied above .",
    "consider a drop of liquid which is completely wetting on a hydrophilic strip of width @xmath65 . in the late stages , let the height of the liquid above the surface be @xmath66 , and a measure of the extent of spreading be @xmath67 .",
    "the capillary pressure which drives the spreading is due to the transverse curvature of the interface , which for @xmath66 is @xmath68 .",
    "the pressure gradient is thus @xmath69 . in the lubrication approximation with @xmath70 , a poiseuille - like law obtains for the fluid velocity with @xmath21 being the relevant length scale .",
    "hence the rate of extension of the droplet obeys @xmath71 .",
    "volume conservation indicates @xmath72 and eliminating @xmath21 between this and the above spreading rate finds @xmath73 .",
    "this integrates to @xmath74 .",
    "this is the predicted scaling law for the late stages of spreading in this problem , in the absence of a reservoir .",
    "found by integrating eq .",
    "( [ odeeq ] ) with boundary conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 at @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a scaled distance . in case ( a )",

    "( [ eqpara ] ) . in case ( b ) the shape is obtained by numerical integration.[fig : shape ] ]",

    "[ fig : diagram](c ) . an equation which expresses local conservation of liquid in the wedge is @xmath80 where @xmath51 is the local cross section area occupied by liquid , @xmath81 the mean velocity of the liquid , and @xmath82 is distance along the wedge .",
