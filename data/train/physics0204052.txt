    "fluid bilayer membranes made of lipids separate the contents of cells from their surroundings .",
    "the stability of those membranes under external perturbations is consequently of vital importance . in particular ,",
    "if ruptured the functions of the cell will be disabled . naturally , a red cell bilayer membrane may rupture to free hemoglobin , protein responsible for oxygen transportation in blood .",
    "this particular rupture , called blood cell hemolysis is achieved through thermal swelling of red cells @xcite .",
    "rupture or lysis can be achieved in a number of ways .",
    "most experiments involved application of electric fields which produce compressive forces through the capacitor effect .",
    "more recently a number of other ways have been used : mechanically , by suction through a pipette @xcite , or extrusion through pores @xcite ; and by osmotic swelling of the cell @xcite . with the rapid progress in microscopic manipulation techniques , pore formation",
    "can also serve a positive purpose in drug delivery and gene therapy @xcite .",
    "the number of experimental studies of the mechanical properties of the cell is rapidly increasing and we only quoted a few examples of recent work @xcite .    for the fluid bilayers , there is a significant degree of consensus on the order of magnitude of the quantities involved in membrane rupture . for phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) bilayers , area expansion seems to be only 2% to 4% before rupture .",
    "the corresponding external tension is of the order of 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 n / m @xcite .",
    "it also seems that in liquid membranes , rupture occurs via the nucleation of holes .",
    "those observations are consistent with what is expected from structural considerations .",
    "solid membranes as they go from brittle to ductile , experience rupture kinetics which evolve from processes dominated by crack formation to hole formation @xcite .",
    "more precisely , as the surface tension increases , the membrane will first be weakened by the apparition of small unstable pores with life - times as short as a few nanoseconds . at a critical tension , a large stable pore opens , relaxing almost entirely the membrane .",
    "this is rupture .",
    "pore sizes can range from nano- to micro - meter in radius . in electroporation experiments",
    ", pores can last several microseconds @xcite . using mechanical means , namely micropipette extrusion on vesicles",
    ", pores can be kept open for several seconds before resealing @xcite .",
    "several models of membrane rupture have been developed over the years .",
    "most of them derive from a model suggested by litster a quarter of a century ago @xcite .",
    "it explains the stability in terms of a surface energy and a pore edge energy .",
    "the model defines a critical pore size and an energy barrier for the creation of an irreversibly growing pore .",
    "it has been extended and applied by other groups in particular to electric breakdown situations @xcite .",
    "shillcock and boal investigated the effect of temperature on membrane stability @xcite .",
    "temperature increases the entropy of the pore lowering its free energy .",
    "they show that even at zero tension , edge energy is required for stability .",
    "netz and schick have also developed a mean - field theory of the fluid bilayers as stacks of diblock copolymers @xcite .    in our work",
    ", we derive the energy of a finite size membrane under lateral expansion .",
    "we then consider pore creation as a thermally activated process @xcite .",
    "there is an important entropic element implied in a nucleation process .",
    "the model is for a bilayer whose relevant physical quantities have their origin in the hydrophobicity of the lipid tails @xcite .",
    "these quantities are the area compressibility ( for expansion ) @xmath0 which results from the increased exposure of the hydrophobic tails as the membrane is stretched , the edge tension _",
    "@xmath6 _ , ( or edge energy per unit length ) which is the result of the exposure of these tails to water along the edge of the pore , and the rigidity @xmath3 of the tails .    in the model , the bilayer is characterized by an energy per site , essentially one molecule in size .",
    "it incorporates stress relaxation as a pore is created and grows .",
    "pore - pore interactions are automatically taken into account .",
    "an equilibrium phase diagram is constructed determining regions of no _ pores _ , non - critical pores ( or _ protopores _ ) , and _",
    "rupture_. the phase diagram is in terms of the temperature and the area expansion of the membrane .",
    "the critical temperatures scale with the strength of the hydrophobic interaction which to first order is linked to the length of the tails of the lipids .",
    "this hydrophobic interaction is obtained from parameters appropriate to pure phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) @xcite .",
    "our model applies to low strain rates since the model assumes that the membrane remains in mechanical equilibrium as it is stretched .",
    "we predict the rupture scenario for normal membranes , membranes made of unsaturated lipids , and very thick membranes .",
    "the following two sections develop the model .",
    "we first lay its physical foundations , and then present our ising like model , which is solved using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we continue with the results and finish with a discussion of the possible extensions of the model .",
    "upon area increase , stress will build up in the membrane .",
    "as mentioned earlier , being a liquid the most likely stress release mechanism will be the formation of holes or pores .",
    "let us imagine that a hole has appeared through thermal induced stress fluctuations .",
    "the question will be whether the gain in energy occasioned by the relaxation of the surfactants will counterbalance the energy loss through exposure of the tails of the molecule to the solvent .",
    "if this is the case , the hole will continue to grow into a large pore that will permit the system to relax almost entirely . for now , we assume the process to be purely planar . whether fluctuations in the third dimension are important is an open question . at first thought they do not seem predominant .",
    "assuming an elastic regime for small expansions of the membrane on a lattice of total relaxed area @xmath7 and molecular area @xmath8 , the energy cost associated with the stretching the membrane is given by @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the compressibility ( for expansion ) and @xmath10 the excess area per molecule . for small expansion , the compressibility can be found experimentally from various techniques described previously .",
    "the apparent compressibility is the measure of the slope of the stress - strain curve of a membrane under a small tension , that is the slope of the curve @xmath11 where _",
    "@xmath12 _ is the surface tension .",
    "however , since those membranes are fluid , thermal transverse undulations are usually present . for small stretches , a fraction of the tension does not induce any strain , but rather brings back the membrane in its plane @xcite .",
    "the real compressibility is obtained by the slope of the stress - strain curve , but only in the regime where the undulations have been ironed out . for many lipids ,",
    "this compressibility is about 243 mn / m @xcite .",
    "when a single pore is inserted , some of this stress will be relieved .",
    "the relative change in the area per molecule becomes : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the area of the pore and @xmath15 is the total expansion of the membrane .",
    "but the edge of the new pore will now be exposed to water .",
    "as the tails are hydrophobic , this will result in an increase of the energy proportional to the perimeter of the pore .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume the pore to be circular .",
    "in the presence of a pore , the energy of a stretched membrane then becomes @xmath16 the parameter _",
    "@xmath6 _ represents the edge tension ( the effective edge energy per unit length ) .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is the total edge energy , which represents the loss of energy on the perimeter of the circular hole .",
    "the second term , the surface energy , is the loss in energy resulting from the relaxation of the membrane induced by the hole , which augments the density of particles in the rest of the membrane . for the edge tension , it can be rewritten as @xmath17 where 2@xmath18 is the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer , and therefore @xmath18 is the length of the lipid tails . and @xmath19 , the hydrophobicity , is the hydrophobic energy of the lipid tails per unit area . with the usually quoted hydrophobicity of 40 mn / m @xcite ,",
    "the edge tension @xmath6 is of the order of @xmath20  mn @xcite .",
    "the experimentally measured values range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 mn @xcite .    in the limit of large systems",
    ", the energy barrier to rupture is given by @xmath23 and occurs for a pore area @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath14 exceeds that critical value , the pore will grow till the membrane reaches the minimum energy configuration near @xmath25 .",
    "this argument predicts a barrier height of the order of @xmath26 ( @xmath27mj ) for experimentally observed stretches , such as @xmath28% and a membrane of total area @xmath29m@xmath30 , typical for pc membranes . even if the entropic components were very significant as mentioned above , it is not sufficient to decrease significantly this large barrier .",
    "moreover , according to these arguments , rupture should only happen at stretches around @xmath31% !    in our opinion ,",
    "the problem lies in an over - estimation of the line energy due to two factors .",
    "firstly , when membranes expand , the tails get exposed to water , so @xmath32 is not a constant ( especially not at @xmath33 ) .",
    "it decreases with increased stretching of the membrane .",
    "secondly lipid bilayers are permeable and this permeability may be affected by the expansion of the membrane .",
    "so the hydrophobicity @xmath2 used in the computation of the line energy will be smaller than the ideal value quoted above .",
    "we call @xmath2 an _ apparent _ hydrophobicity and the @xmath2 given above the _ pure _ hydrophobicity @xmath34",
    ". @xmath2 will be an adjustable parameter .      under expansion ,",
    "more water will enter the membrane , augmenting the free energy .",
    "the compressibility ( upon expansion ) @xmath0 has therefore its origin in hydrophobicity .",
    "moreover , the rigidity of the acyl tails controls the amount of water that penetrates the membrane at a given stretch .",
    "there is therefore a very close relationship between surface energy , compressibility and tail rigidity .",
    "we will closely follow here some of the arguments of wortis and evans @xcite ( themselves based partly on israelachvili s book @xcite ) for what pertains to the compressibility but adding the concept of the rigidity of the tails .    to estimate @xmath0",
    ", we must understand the balance of forces that sets the area of the lipids @xmath35 .",
    "the repulsive force between lipids is strong at short distances , but falls off rapidly as @xmath35 increases @xcite .",
    "this repulsion is modelled by a potential of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a positive constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the attractive part of the potential is a direct consequence of hydrophobicity .",
    "more water can enter in contact with the hydrocarbon chains as the lipids are separated from one another . in earlier work @xcite a linear regime is assumed for small expansions of the cross section area of a lipid @xmath35 , and the energy per molecule is written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the equilibrium area .",
    "this assumes that the tails are totally flexible and that the area exposed to water is equal to the increase in area of the membrane @xmath40 .",
    "however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , the lipid tails more likely will only be able to partially close up the opening .",
    "we introduce a geometrical factor @xmath41 defined so that @xmath42 represents the actual surface exposed to water per molecule under stretching , and hence @xmath43 the increased energy per molecule .",
    "the factor @xmath44 is related to the rigidity of the tails , and therefore from now on , @xmath44 will be referred as the tail rigidity . to have a geometric picture of @xmath44 ,",
    "lets imagine that the stretching @xmath45 is represented by a circle , and the effective exposed surface by a cone of surface @xmath46 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath3 is then the ratio @xmath47 .",
    "a rigidity of 1 represents tails that are completely flexible since the expanded lateral surface @xmath45 is equal to the increased exposure of the tails to water .",
    "in contrast , a high rigidity represents very stiff chains , such that a small stretch can lead to a full exposure of the tails to water . with the geometry shown in fig .",
    "1 , the length @xmath48 of the tails exposed to water can be written as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radius of the lipids .",
    "the non - exposed length @xmath51 should be used in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) to calculate the line energy when a pore is nucleated at a certain stretch .",
    "fixing the rigidity @xmath3 for a certain type of lipid determines @xmath52 and @xmath53 as a function of the effective stretch .",
    "if we combine both the attractive and the repulsive parts of the potential , we get a general expression for the energy per molecular site of the membrane : @xmath54 the factor of @xmath55 in the first term comes from the fact that we are dealing with a bilayer .",
    "the requirement @xmath56 leads to the relationship @xmath57 .",
    "it must be emphasized that _",
    "@xmath19 _ here represents the interaction of the lipids when present in the membrane , and therefore refers to the _ apparent _ hydrophobicity , in opposition to the pure hydrophobicity @xmath58 discussed earlier in this section . by comparing the curvature of this potential around the minimum with the surface energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath59 thus , there is a close relationship between the compressibility @xmath0 , the hydrophobicity @xmath2 and the rigidity @xmath3 . in our simulations",
    ", we use the experimentally known values of compressibility @xmath0 , and set the rigidity @xmath44 to obtain rupture near 4% for the pc type bilayers . with the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , we shall demonstrate in section [ res - rig ] that the apparent hydrophobicity @xmath2 is considerably smaller than the pure one @xmath60 , which ignores the water already present in the membrane . with @xmath60",
    "the line energy is over - estimated as we saw above .",
    "what we are trying to simulate is a thermally activated nucleation process , it is therefore natural to consider a model amenable to a monte carlo simulation . for ease of computation",
    "we consider a lattice model similar to the well - known ising model for binary mixtures , and consider the equilibrium phase diagram of the system as a function of temperature and area expansion .",
    "this will reveal the expected scenarios of rupture as the membrane is expanded slowly , quasi - statically , so that the membrane remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at every step of the way .",
    "we will limit ourselves to two - dimensions , and to represent an isotropic liquid , we will use a hexagonal lattice ( 6 nearest neighbors ) .",
    "we begin by presenting the standard binary mixture model ( sbmm ) as applied to our problem and then describe the modifications and simplifications that we have made to it to incorporate the stress relaxation that occurs when a hole is created . in the sbmm ,",
    "every site can be in either of two states , in our case `` a '' or `` h '' , representing respectively sites occupied by a phospholipid or a hole .",
    "the site occupancy variable @xmath61 , is equal to 1 if the site is an `` a '' site and 0 if it is a `` h '' site .",
    "the indices @xmath62 and @xmath63 run from 1 to @xmath64 , where @xmath64 is the total number of sites .",
    "let @xmath65 , or its compact form @xmath66 , be the interaction between two lipids separated by a distance @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the position vector for site @xmath62 . in a similar way , @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 are defined .",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) and eliminate the constant terms and the single sums since the number of each type of particle is conserved . in our binary mixture model , we keep the number @xmath64 of particles ( the @xmath35 sites ) and the total area constant .",
    "the number of holes ( the @xmath73 sites ) , however , can vary .",
    "our model is neither the conventional canonical or grand canonical version of the binary mixture model . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "occupied ( @xmath35 ) and empty ( @xmath73 ) sites are interchanged to preserve the total number of particles .",
    "the conventional canonical model would be used if we were only interested in the phase separation of a system , which is not our case . in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the only dynamics that would be observed is the distribution of the holes .",
    "neither model is suitable to incorporate the relaxation created by the appearance of a hole .",
    "we start with the sbmm in the canonical ensemble with an initial total number of particles equal to the number of sites @xmath64 .",
    "we now modify the model to impose the following constraints : the total area of the membrane stays constant as holes are created and the total number of lipids @xmath35 particles- stays constant .",
    "these lead to the following change in the dynamics . occupied",
    "sites , when holes are created , now contain more than one particle , actually @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number of hole sites at a given time .",
    "the area of the occupied and hole sites stay constant .",
    "the nucleation of holes therefore relaxes the membrane and reduces the interparticle distance @xmath76 .",
    "this relaxation represents the surface energy and is the @xmath77 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .    on the other hand , the interaction energy between holes and particles @xmath78 represents the line energy of pores .",
    "the occupancy of sites being larger than one in such a case , there are more particles on the edge than the actual number of sites . as we will discuss in section [ line - energy ]",
    ", this will lead to a correction in the line energy .",
    "finally the hole - hole interaction @xmath79 is set to zero .",
    "the surface energy is not calculated using the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) but directly using the occupied area in the membrane . with @xmath75 hole sites ,",
    "the interparticle distances have to be rescaled to the new values @xmath80 where the @xmath81 are the initial intermolecular distances . as discussed earlier",
    ", the nucleation of holes changes the density of lipids in the membrane but conserves their number . since we assume uniform relaxation at each step of the simulation , the relative change in area per lipid , defined in eq .",
    "( [ deltaa ] ) , can be re - written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is now the total pore area , and not just the area of one pore .",
    "the surface energy can be calculated directly using the compressibility from the relation , @xmath84    it is clear from this last equation that if the relative number of holes @xmath85 completely relaxes the imposed stretch on the membrane @xmath86 , the surface energy vanishes , as expected .",
    "as previously mentioned , the edge energy represents the hydrophobic contacts along the perimeter of a pore , measured by the hole - lipid interaction @xmath78 .",
    "the edge energy therefore depends on the location of the holes in the lattice .",
    "the sum of those interactions can not be reduced to a simple form like the surface energy .    as we are working on a hexagonal lattice , @xmath78 consists of the energy of exposing one sixth of the hydrophobic surface of a lipid to water , multiplied by two for the bilayer .",
    "it is a first neighbor interaction .",
    "@xmath78 can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath8 is the cross section of the lipids , and @xmath51 the hydrophobic length of the lipid tails that are not exposed to water ( @xmath32 and @xmath48 are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) respectively ) .",
    "the hydrophobic energy of the exposed height @xmath52 is the origin of the surface energy .    in the simulation the occupancy variables @xmath61",
    "remain equal to either @xmath88 or @xmath21 .",
    "so the edge energy as calculated by the program is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of lipid - hole interactions ( between sites ) .",
    "however , every time a hole site is created , the density of the particles and hence the interparticle distance changes as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , in particular the nearest neighbor interparticle distance @xmath91 .",
    "there are therefore more particles on the edge of a pore than the actual number of sites .",
    "the edge energy per unit length can be written as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the scaled nearest neighbor interparticle distance .",
    "and hence the correct expression for the line energy is : @xmath94 using eq .",

    "although the occupation of sites changes as the simulation evolves , detailed balance is satisfied because each configuration of pores has a uniquely defined energy .",
    "this energy does not depend upon the path followed to reach it .",
    "the transition probability between a given initial and final configuration will also be unique and reversible .",

    "this acceptance rule is the usual one for a monte carlo simulation in the canonical ensemble .",
    "finally , periodic boundary conditions are considered on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the approach is highly efficient and large systems can be studied , up to 10@xmath98 particles .",

    "the types of membranes we study can be grouped in three main categories : saturated lipid bilayers ( typical ) , unsaturated lipid bilayers , and long chain diblock copolymer bilayers .",
    "membranes with unsaturated lipids may be found in biological systems .",
    "the long tail diblock copolymers , however , were synthesized by bermudez et al . , and then used to built vesicle shape polymersomes @xcite . in table 1",

    "the unsaturated lipid membranes differ from the typical membranes in the stiffness of their tails while the diblock copolymers simply have longer tails .",
    ".compressibility and other known physical parameters of the different types of membranes studied .",
    "these parameters are : the total number of cis - unsaturated bonds in the lipid tails (  _ uns_.  ) , the compressibility @xmath0 , the thickness of the tails @xmath103 , the permeability @xmath104 , the critical tension for rupture @xmath105 , and corresponding area stretching @xmath106 .",
    "values for typical ( i.e. with none or only one unsaturated bond ) and unsaturated lipids are from olbrich et al .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    to obtain @xmath44 and therefore @xmath19 , of the different membranes , we fit the tail rigidity to have the corresponding stretching to rupture . for typical lipid bilayer membranes",
    ", we need a rigidity of @xmath107 to have rupture at @xmath108% ( see figure 4 ) . from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , this corresponds to a hydrophobicity of @xmath109 .",
    "the plateau near @xmath110 stretching in figure 4 for large @xmath111 s may seem abnormal at first sight .",
    "even more , just before zero tension rupture , there is even a slight increase in the stretching to rupture .",
    "this effect is related to the criterion that defines rupture .",
    "zero tension rupture means that the lipids are so stiff and the membrane so permeable that stability is not even assured . just before this critical rigidity",
    ", the membrane is still not very stable , since the line energy per lipid rapidly decreases with stretching .",
    "this weak interaction between lipids raises the entropy of the system . for high rigidities , this gain in entropy",
    "will make the rupture scenario more comparable to a melting phenomenon than a pore creation relaxation .",
    "since we have lost the ideal scenario of rupture which favors relaxation as opposed to the creation of line energy , rupture in terms of a few stable pores is more difficult to achieve .",
    "the definition of rupture will be discussed in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "nevertheless , this plateau seems consistent with experimental observations .",
    "unsaturated lipids with 2 and 4 total unsaturated bonds both have a stretching to rupture near 2% ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this therefore means that even though they have the same stretching to rupture does not mean they have the same tail rigidity .",
    "in fact , they should not .    for typical membranes , the apparent hydrophobicity @xmath2 is about 5 times smaller than the approximated value for @xmath58 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this leads to a line energy of @xmath112 mn , well with the experimentally measured range of @xmath21 to @xmath22 mn . for highly unsaturated lipids , this ratio can be as high as 10 if we suppose that the pure hydrophobicity has not changed significantly .",
    "it would be wrong , however , to say that 80% of the membrane is flooded .",
    "this apparent hydrophobicity may also take into account other repulsive energies , such as the head - head repulsion .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 was approximated from geometrical simplifications , and might be smaller than 40 mn / m . nevertheless , this noticeable difference between the pure and the apparent hydrophobicity indicates that membrane permeability is not a negligible effect .",
    "graphics similar to figure 4 were used to obtain the tail rigidity of the diblock copolymers studied by bermudez et al . @xcite .",
    "the tail rigidity of oe7 and ob8 is comparable to the rigidity of a typical lipid tail .",
    "however , for ob18 , which has a much longer tail ( see table i ) @xmath44 is considerably higher .",
    "it may be that for very long polymers tail entanglements make the tails appear more rigid @xcite .    in the following subsections , we focus on _ typical _ biological membranes .",
    "so @xmath44 is set equal to @xmath113 .",
    "a phase diagram was constructed to study the behavior of the membrane under variations of the temperature and the surface area ( i.e. under stretching ) .",
    "we show the phase diagram in fig . 5 for a  typical",
    " membrane ( see table i ) .",
    "the most striking feature is a ",
    "first order transition  line to a ruptured state .",
    "when at a given temperature , the membrane is stretched , one observes in the neighborhood of a specific stretch an abrupt increase in the relaxation which we call _",
    "rupture_. this occurs through the formation of a few massive stable pores .",
    "the line shown in fig .",
    "5 corresponds to the point of abrupt relaxation as the tension is increased . below this line",
    "the nature of the membrane evolves gradually with temperature @xmath114 . at low @xmath114 , including around @xmath115 , there is what we call a _",
    "stable _ state .",
    "the relaxation in this regime is small , with occasionally a few protopores ( see section [ sec - por ] ) . as the temperature",
    "is raised the number and the size of the protopores keep increasing .",
    "the pores become numerous , but are still short lived , and of size no larger than 10 particles or so .    at temperatures below and near @xmath115",
    ", rupture is very sharp .",
    "we go directly from a state of high tension where less than @xmath116 of the membrane is relaxed to an almost fully relaxed system ( @xmath117 and more ) . at higher temperatures , there are a larger number of pores present in the membrane at low stretches , but they do not aggregate till the tension reaches the rupture tension .",
    "the rupture line first decreases with temperature till @xmath118 then rises again .",
    "entropy appears to favor a high density of dispersed pores .",
    "it takes then an increased tension to force the aggregation of the pores and trigger the full relaxation of the membrane .",
    "this leads to the rise in the rupture tension .",
    "finally the rupture line ends near @xmath119 , but it is no longer a first order transition line . at that temperature",
    "the membrane loses stability : _ stable _ pores are created without any tension applied .",
    "the reduced line energy @xmath120 falls below the critical value required to assure membrane stability .",
    "shillcock and boal @xcite vary @xmath121 in their tethered beads model .",
    "they find a critical value of @xmath122 at constant zero - tension , where @xmath123 is the average vertex separation in their model ( at @xmath115 , this means a critical line energy of about @xmath124 j / m ) .",
    "we work at constant area and , in our model , we calculate hole - lipid interactions and the total line energy is given by @xmath125 ( see eq .",

    "[ fig - por]c , one can find an effective line energy per site of approximately @xmath129 ( small pores dominate the distribution ) @xcite , or a critical line energy per unit length of about @xmath130 j / m .",
    "interestingly our lattice model and shillcock and boal s bond flipping model have consistent views on stability .",
    "mechanically the membrane may fail earlier so we label the region around @xmath131 as _",
    "unstable_.    at room temperature , the presence of a regime offering @xmath110 to @xmath132 unstable pore surface , or small non - stable pores , called protopores , have experimentally been observed at room temperature @xcite . in the next three subsections",
    "we look at different properties of the membrane under tension that give a clearer picture of the rupture kinetics .      to show that indeed rupture is  first - order  , samples were put through a full cycle of expansion and compression .",
    "this is done again in a quasi - static process , i.e. at each step the system is allowed to relax .",
    "we follow , as the strain was varied , the variations in the stress ( fig .",
    "6a ) , the relative pore area ( a measure of the relaxation)(fig .",
    "6b ) , and the total number of pores ( a measure of pore interaction and coalescence)(fig .",
    "hysteresis effects are found to be very strong at low temperature .",
    "rupture and healing occur through nucleation of one pore . at high temperature",
    ", hysteresis is reduced and there are many more pores present , below and above rupture . at @xmath115 , the case illustrated in figs .",
    "6 , behavior is similar to the high temperature situation below rupture , but comparable to the low temperature case above rupture .",
    "a considerable number of pores are present in the membrane at first , but after rupture , only a small number of large non - fluctuating pores remain .",
    "this is clearly observable in fig .",
    "6c as the rapid rise in the number of pores which precedes the collapse at rupture .",
    "the tension at collapse defines the @xmath115 point on the rupture line .      to further illustrate the difference in pore distribution below and above rupture",
    ", we compare the distribution of pore sizes for membranes with 2% and 6% strain .",
    "we do this at the three temperatures @xmath115 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 to illustrate the change in structure of the membrane with increasing temperature ( see figs .",
    "[ fig - por ] ( a),(b ) , and ( c ) ) .",
    "the distributions are typical snap - shots of the membrane as the monte carlo simulation evolves . for the stable membranes shown , we see in figures 7a and 7b ,",
    "the sharp drop in the number of small pores above rupture .",
    "a large pore creates less line energy than a protopore for the same gain in surface energy , so is energetically favored . for unstable membranes , the appearance of larger pores in the system",
    "does not reduce the number of smaller ones ( figure 7c ) .",
    "the small pores , present at zero tension at @xmath134 are stable due to the contribution of entropy to the free energy .",
    "this illustrates from another perspective the instability of the membrane at 3@xmath115 .      at different temperatures for a stretching of 3% ( just before rupture ) , we insert into the membrane a hole at the origin . after the pore is fully opened and stable , we compute its fractal dimension @xmath135 from the scaling relationship between the pore area @xmath136 and its perimeter @xmath137 ( @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a proportionality factor ) .    from the results plotted in figure 8",
    ", we clearly see that @xmath135 decreases as the temperature is raised .",
    "this is caused by increased irregularities along the edge of the pore . at @xmath114 = 2.8 @xmath115 , where rupture occurs spontaneously at zero tension",
    ", one would expect the scaling relationship applicable to a self - avoiding ring @xcite .",
    "in such geometries , the area of the pore should scale as @xmath140 . for this case ,",
    "our model gives @xmath141 in agreement with this argument .",
    "bilayer membranes are an intrinsic part of all living species . with the rapid development of biotechnology , membranes",
    "can now be artificially created , and thereafter even modified to form vesicles of controlled size and properties .",
    "rupture kinetics play an integral part in the modifications of those vesicles and in their applications such as in drug delivery .    in spite of their complex molecular structure ,",
    "lipid bilayer membranes offer an ideal model system , as hydrophobicity is responsible for both the edge line energy and the bulk compressibility ( for extension ) .",
    "we have developed the first model for the rupture of a membrane held together by hydrophobic forces , which includes the nucleation and growth of pores .",
    "our minimal model can be used to reproduce current results on saturated and unsaturated pc lipid bilayers and thicker artificial bilayers made of diblock copolymers .",
    "we have introduced a new quantity called the rigidity of the tails @xmath3 which permits the study the effect of saturation of the lipid tails on the structural properties of the bilayer .",
    "interestingly an increase in rigidity produces a decrease in apparent hydrophobicity since @xmath0 is nearly constant for a given class of lipids .",
    "this may mean an increase in permeability .",
    "the model requires little computer time allowing the handling of real size vesicles .",
    "entropic and nucleation effects are included naturally .    the structural integrity of a lipid bilayer",
    "is considerably affected by its composition ; biological membrane structure can be fairly complex .",
    "different types of lipids , cholesterols , and proteins play an important role in determining membrane stability .",
    "the model has the potential of handling these inclusions .",
