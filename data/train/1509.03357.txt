    "social contagions are ubiquitous in human society , and generate new scientific challenges for network science  @xcite .",
    "all the researches about sentiments contagion , information spreading and behavior spreading fall into the category of studying social contagions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , behavior spreading , as a representative and essential type of social contagions , has attracted great attention , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "understanding the spreading mechanisms behind behavior has the potential to not only help us design better anti - virus strategies  @xcite , but also shed new insights into the control of social unrest  @xcite .",
    "moreover , different from biological contagions ( such as epidemic spreading )  @xcite , social contagions display one inherent characteristic : social reinforcement effect  @xcite , which usually plays a vital role in the final status of contagions .",
    "to examine social reinforcement effect , some successful models have been proposed  @xcite , most of which assume that all individuals have the same adoption threshold to incorporate such an effect ( so - called threshold model ) . that is to say , each individual adopts the behavior only when the fraction  @xcite or number  @xcite of neighbors with the adopted state exceeds his adoption threshold . in this case , the social contagions is a trivial case of markovian process . by means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis",
    ", it was found that the social reinforcement effect can evidently change the phase transitions of contagion dynamics .",
    "more specifically , the final adoption size first grows continuously and then decreases discontinuously with the increase of mean degree when the adoption threshold of all individuals is identical  @xcite .",
    "after this seminal discovery , the role of threshold model and its various underlying mechanisms , in social contagions have been intensively explored , including the influence of dynamical parameters ( e.g. , initial seeds and threshold sizes  @xcite ) , and topology characteristics ( degree - degree correlations  @xcite , clustering  @xcite , community structure  @xcite as well as multiplexity framework  @xcite ) , which are the primary factors in determining the final adoption size and phase transition .",
    "some non - markovian social contagion models were also proposed to describe the social reinforcement effect  @xcite .",
    "for example , in a recent research paper  @xcite , where the social reinforcement was derived from the memory of non - redundant information transmission , it was found that the perturbation of dynamical or structural parameters makes the dependence of final behavior adoption size on information transmission probability change from being discontinuous to being continuous . in ref .",
    "@xcite , zheng _",
    "et al_. further verified that the role of social reinforcement in behavior diffusion on regular graphs and online social networks , which is consistent with early experimental anticipation  @xcite    recently , researchers found that the widely existed individual heterogeneity dramatically alters the spreading dynamics . in epidemic",
    "spreading , the heterogeneous infectivity and susceptibility can change the outbreak threshold  @xcite . for information spreading , the heterogeneous",
    "waiting and response time may speed up or slow down the velocity of information diffusion  @xcite .",
    "statistical physicists found that individual heterogeneity can induce the hybrid phase transition  @xcite , which mixes the traditional first - order and second - order transitions , in _",
    "k_-core percolation  @xcite and bootstrap percolation  @xcite . in practical behavior",
    "spreading , individuals usually show different wills to mimic the behavior , which means that each agent owns his own adoption threshold  @xcite .",
    "some individuals with low adoption threshold show strong wills to adopt the behavior and act as _ activists_. nevertheless , others with high adoption threshold need to capture more behavioral information before imitation , and they often act as _ bigots_. with regard to the difference of adoption threshold , it may be closely related with personal interests , education background , or other personality and social factors  @xcite .",
    "for example , the well - educated population is more likely to adopt the high - tech products than that among the populations who lacks the basic education .",
    "similarly , students are more likely to adopt an interesting computer game than housewives .",
    "unfortunately , there is still absence of systematical understanding about the role of heterogeneous adoption thresholds in social contagions . aiming to resolve this issue",
    ", we will explore how heterogeneous adoption thresholds affect the final adoption size and phase transition of social contagions based on a so - called binary spreading threshold model , which is a non - markovian process .",
    "meanwhile , an edge - based compartmental theory is developed for quantitative validation .",
    "interestingly , it is found that heterogeneous adoption thresholds significantly affect the final adoption size , and generate the hierarchical characteristic of adopting behavior : activists first adopt the given behavior themselves , and then stimulate bigots to follow this behavior .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that such a heterogeneous threshold model results in the existence of first - order , seconde - order and hybrid phase transitions .",
    "more importantly , there are two different kinds of crossover phenomena in phase transition for distinct values of the bigots adoption threshold : a change from first - order or hybrid phase transitions to the second - order phase transition . in",
    "what follows , we will first describe the heterogeneous social contagion model in complex networks , followed by the description of edge - based compartmental theory , and then represent the simulation and analysis results .",
    "finally , we will draw our conclusions .",
    "behavior spreading on complex networks is considered with @xmath0 nodes and the degree distribution @xmath1 . as the interaction networks",
    ", we use the configuration model  @xcite to avoid the additional influence of degree - degree correlations .",
    "nodes in the network represent individuals and edges between nodes stand for the contacts with which behavioral information transmission may occur . for each individual",
    ", a static behavioral adoption threshold is assigned according to a specific distribution function @xmath2 , which is independent of network topology .",
    "the larger value of @xmath3 means that an individual needs to capture more behavioral information from his neighbors before adopting the behavior .    with regard to behavior spreading dynamics , we generalize the spreading threshold model with social reinforcement derived from memory of non - redundant information transmission characters  @xcite . in this model",
    ", each individual falls into one of the three states : susceptible ( s ) , adopted ( a ) and recovered ( r ) ( namely , susceptible - adopted - recovered , sar model ) . in the susceptible state , an individual does not adopt the behavior . in the adopted state",
    ", an individual adopts the behavior and tries to transmit the behavioral information to his neighbors . in the recovered state ,",
    "an individual loses interest in the behavior and will not transmit the behavioral information further . initially , a vanishingly small fraction of individuals @xmath4 are chosen as seeds ( adopters ) at random , while the others are fixed in the susceptible state .    at each time step , each adopted individual @xmath5 tries to diffuse the behavioral information to every susceptible neighbor with probability @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , once the information is transmitted through an edge successfully , it will never be transmitted again , i.e. , only non - redundant information transmission is allowed .",
    "if the susceptible neighbor @xmath7 of @xmath5 is successfully informed , his cumulative pieces of information @xmath8 add @xmath9 ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) .",
    "subsequently , individual @xmath7 compares the new value of @xmath8 with his adoption threshold @xmath11 , and becomes an adopter once @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , whether an individual adopts the behavior is determined by the cumulative pieces of behavioral information he ever received from distinct neighbors .",
    "thus , the non - markovian effect is induced in the behavior spreading dynamics .",
    "after information transmission , individual @xmath5 may lose interest in the behavior with probability @xmath13 and then moves into the recovered state .",
    "individuals falling into the recovered state will stop from participating in the further behavioral information spreading , and the spreading dynamics terminate when all adopted individuals become recovered .",
    "in order to describe the strong dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors in heterogeneous social contagion model , an edge - based compartmental approach is established herein , which is inspired by refs .",
    "correspondingly , the notations @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively represent the fraction of individuals in the susceptible , adopted , and recovered states at time step @xmath17 .",
    "individual @xmath7 is set to be in the cavity state , which means that he can receive behavioral information from neighbors but not transmit behavioral information to his neighbors  @xcite .",
    "define @xmath18 as the probability that individual @xmath5 has not transmitted the behavioral information to individual @xmath7 along a randomly chosen edge by time @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the probability that an individual @xmath7 with degree @xmath19 has received @xmath8 pieces of behavioral information from distinct neighbors by time @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath20^{k - m}[1-\\theta(t)]^m.\\ ] ] individual @xmath7 in the susceptible state implies that the cumulative pieces of behavioral information @xmath8 he received are still less than his adoption threshold @xmath11 . according to the social contagion model in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the adoption threshold and degree are independent . considering all possible values of @xmath8 and @xmath11 , it can be obtained that the probability of individual @xmath7 with degree @xmath19 being susceptible is @xmath21 combing the degree distribution of a network , the fraction of susceptible individuals at time step @xmath17 is @xmath22 it is obvious that @xmath14 can be figured out after @xmath18 is known .    as a neighbor of individual @xmath7 may be in one of susceptible , adopted or recovered state , @xmath18 can be divided into three cases as @xmath23 and @xmath24 [ @xmath25 or @xmath26 denotes that the susceptible ( adopted or recovered ) neighbor @xmath5 of @xmath7 has not transmitted the behavioral information to individual @xmath7 up to time @xmath17 .",

    "if individual @xmath5 with degree @xmath27 is susceptible initially , he can not transmit the behavioral information to @xmath7 , but only receive it from other @xmath28 neighbors since @xmath7 in a cavity state .",

    "our theoretical predictions of @xmath72 , @xmath118 and @xmath47 have a good agreement with the numerical predictions .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",

    "the network heterogeneity increases with the decrease of @xmath133 .    in the case of @xmath121 , we find that the global behavior adoption more likely to occur ( i.e. , lower @xmath72 ) in heterogeneous networks , due to the existence of hubs in heterogeneous networks  @xcite , as shown in fig .",

    "understanding social contagion dynamics in human populations is extremely challenging . in practical behavior",
    "spreading , individuals usually display different criterions ( wills ) to adopt the behavior .",
    "that is to say , the heterogeneity of adoption thresholds do indeed exist , but its effects on social contagions have not been verified straightforward . to fill this gap , we proposed a non - markovian behavior spreading model , in which individuals have distinct adoption thresholds , to explore how heterogeneous adoption thresholds affect the final adoption size and phase transition .",
    "an edge - based compartmental theory is developed to quantificationally describe this model , and this suggested theory is verified by a large number of simulations . in the paper",

    "we first studied the spreading dynamics on random regular networks . and it is found that heterogeneous adoption thresholds markedly affect @xmath47 , and induce a hierarchical character in behavior adoption . in other words ,",
    "activists first adopt the behavior and then stimulate bigots to adopt the behavior .",
    "all the first - order , second - order and hybrid phase transitions are found to be in existence in the system .",

    "more specifically , the continuous and discontinuous growth of @xmath47 are caused by the activists and bigots , respectively .",
    "there is a crossover phenomenon between the hybrid and second - order phase transitions by varying @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath64 , the system only exhibits the first - order or second - order phase transitions .",
    "interestingly , there is another crossover phenomenon : by varying @xmath48 the phase transition changes from being first - order to being second - order .",
    "finally , we found that network heterogeneity markedly affects @xmath47 and phase transition due to the existence of hub individuals .",
    "for the case of @xmath63 , strong network heterogeneity causes the phase transition to change from being hybrid to being second - order . for @xmath64 , network heterogeneity does not alter the type of phase transition .",
    "the main contribution of our work lies in providing a qualitative and quantitative view on the influence of heterogeneous adoption threshold .",
    "meanwhile , our research results also enrich the phase transition phenomenon .",
    "the developed theory can be generalized to behavior spreading with general adoption threshold distribution , and offer some new inspirations for other similar spreading dynamics , such as epidemic spreading and cascading .",
    "however , some fascinating and hopeful challenges still remain .",
    "for example , what will happen if the adoption thresholds are correlated with their degrees ? how to extract more realistic behavior spreading mechanisms from real data ?",
