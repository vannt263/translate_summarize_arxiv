    "statistical mechanics and thermodynamics are based naturally in different domains .",
    "statistical mechanics starts at the microscopic level with known intermolecular interaction potentials . averaging with the gibbs - boltzmann distribution leads from this microscopic domain to the macroscopic domain where the laws of thermodynamics apply @xcite .",
    "but there is an intermediate mesoscopic domain where essential fluctuation phenomena connected with phase transitions take place .",
    "the theme of this paper is getting information in this difficult domain using the thermodynamic curvature @xmath0 .",
    "at least conceptually , statistical mechanics allows us to `` build up '' from the microscopic level to calculate properties in this mesoscopic regime . but",
    "this operation is generally difficult in practice .",
    "less conceptually natural is thermodynamic fluctuation theory @xcite , in which we  build down  to the mesoscopic domain from the thermodynamic one .",
    "but information gets lost in the averaging yielding thermodynamics from statistical mechanics , and the idea of getting some of this information back seems counterintuitive at first .",
    "here , i do this backtracking using @xmath0 , which connects to intermolecular interactions @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i calculate @xmath0 along the liquid - vapor coexistence curve from the critical point to the triple point for fourteen pure fluids , in both the liquid and vapor phases .",
    "a schematic fluid phase diagram is shown in figure 1 , where @xmath5 denote pressure and temperature , respectively , with subscripts ",
    "c  and  t  for critical and triple point properties , respectively .",
    "the thermodynamic input for this broad survey calculation comes from the nist chemistry webbook @xcite , based on fits of experimental data .",
    "although the contents of this data base will not always be optimal in any particular region , or necessarily contain the latest experimental data , the nist chemistry webbook represents the state of the art in representing data for many fluids over a large span of thermodynamic states .",
    "the calculations in this paper mark the logical first step in understanding the broad behavior of @xmath0 in pure fluids .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "first , i summarize the method of calculation of @xmath0 in a number of thermodynamic coordinates .",
    "second , i give an overview of the physical interpretation of @xmath0 in pure fluids .",
    "this overview includes both what was known previously , and what was learned here .",
    "third , i give results for @xmath0 calculated in fourteen pure fluids with the nist chemistry webbook .",
    "fourth , i have an appendix with proofs of critical point properties of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , i summarize how @xmath0 is calculated in fluids in various coordinate systems . for a given thermodynamic state , @xmath0 is an invariant , the same calculated in any thermodynamic coordinate system .",
    "however , an appropriate coordinate system can much simplify a calculation .",
    "consider a thermodynamic system consisting of one type of molecule , and with fundamental equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the internal energy , @xmath8 is the entropy , @xmath9 is the number of molecules , and @xmath10 is the volume @xcite .",

    "an organized structure with this size is in accord with the expectations from section 3.6 for the compact liquid phase .",
    "as is clear from table 2 , such liquid phase triple point values of @xmath1 are typical for all the fluids .",
    "most of the liquid phase triple point @xmath0 s are negative , characteristic of compact disorganized structures , as in fig . 5e , but there are three fluids with positive @xmath0 , characteristic of the order in the solidlike states , as in fig . 5f .    in the vapor phase for hydrogen",
    ", @xmath0 is uniformly negative .",
    "this is reasonable , since in the asymptotic critical regime @xmath0 is negative , and as we cool towards the triple point the molecules become ever more widely spaced , and the attractive part of the interactions will thus increasingly gain in significance over the repulsive part .",

    "@xmath0 is uniformly negative , but in the liquid phase @xmath0 changes sign and become positive below @xmath37k .",

    "7c , has the commensurate @xmath0 theorem not as conspicuously satisfied as it was for hydrogen and helium . whether this reflects",
    "the real behavior , or shortcomings in the fitting formula in this regime is not clear . for argon , both the liquid and the vapor @xmath0 s are uniformly negative along the entire coexistence curve . the basic pattern for argon is repeated for krypton , xenon , methane ( see fig .",

    "neon shows similar behavior as well , except for a regime of small positive @xmath0 in the liquid phase near the triple point .",
    "neon terminates in an anomalously large liquid @xmath38 , as shown in table 2 .",
    "@xmath0 for oxygen , shown in fig .",
    "7e , has the liquid phase terminate with a positive @xmath0 at the triple point .",
    "@xmath0 changes sign at @xmath39k , with @xmath38 at the triple point anomalously small ; see table 2 . whether or not this is a real effect , or reflects a problem with the data fit , is unclear .",
    "the vapor phase shows a new feature , with @xmath0 decreasing abruptly on approaching the triple point . as is indicated in table 2 , such large vapor phase @xmath1 values",
    "are typically associated with corresponding large increases in the vapor molar volume .",
    "water shows a similar feature , which may be related to metastability .",
    "@xmath0 for water , shown in fig .",
    "7f , shows typical liquid phase behavior .",
    "however , the vapor phase shows a new feature which may be physically significant , a _ positive _ peak for @xmath0 at @xmath40k , with @xmath41 nm@xmath42 .",
    "( for this state @xmath43 ) .",
    "i associate this feature with cluster formation of the type shown in fig . 5b , where water molecules are in a condensed solidlike state held up by the repulsive part of the intermolecular interactions .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the average number of water molecules in a cluster at the peak @xmath0 . by eq .",
    "( [ 417 ] ) , the cluster volume is roughly @xmath44 nm@xmath42 .",
    "assume that each water molecule occupies a spherical volume with van der waals radius : ( 4@xmath45/3)(0.17)@xmath46 , leading to a number of molecules in the cluster of @xmath47 molecules .",
    "computer simulations by johansson et al .",
    "@xcite have found a significant number of water clusters in the coexisting vapor corresponding roughly to this peak @xmath0 .",
    "these clusters were found to be dominated by dimers , though clusters as large as 7 molecules were identified .",
    "methanol shows a similar feature of positive @xmath0 in the vapor phase near the critical point , but the quality of the nist fit may not be as good as for water .",
    "if this connection between positive @xmath0 and physical clusters is correct , then calculating @xmath0 offers a method of identifying fluids and thermodynamic regimes where we might find clusters .",
    "this idea will be pursued elsewhere .    for water , there is a point at @xmath48k where the vapor curve for @xmath0 crosses the liquid curve , and a rapid divergence between the values of @xmath0 in the two phases occurs as we cool to the triple point .",
    "if we interpret these large @xmath0 differences in terms of metastability , then we clearly see that , as we warm from the triple point , metastability should end at @xmath48k .",
    "brennen @xcite gives the maximum temperature of superheating experimentally observed in water as about 550k , with corresponding van der waals value @xmath49k .",
    "in conclusion , this overview of the thermodynamic curvature @xmath0 on the liquid - vapor coexistence curve of fourteen pure fluids has confirmed some old expectations , but also brought forth some new features .",
    "the broad trend is negative values of @xmath0 , as the attractive part of the intermolecular interactions usually dominates for pure fluids , with the exception of compact situations where the molecules are in close contact . in the asymptotic critical region , @xmath50 with the liquid and vapor values of @xmath0 in the coexisting phases equal by theorem .",
    "on cooling towards the triple point , @xmath1 typically decreases until it is of the order of molecular sizes in the liquid phase , but less well defined in the vapor phase .",
    "interesting new features are of three types .",
    "the first is incommensurate @xmath0 s outside the asymptotic critical regime , with fluids of largely different @xmath0 s in the liquid and vapor phases .",
    "i associate this with metastability , where the majority phase has a difficult time making the minority phase because the mesoscopic fluctuating structures in the phases are of different sizes .",
    "although i present no detailed experimental examination supporting this conjecture , it would appear to be at least logical .",
    "second , i associate isolated regimes of positive @xmath0 in the vapor phase near the critical point with the formation of solid clusters .",
    "third , fluids with @xmath0 changing sign through @xmath51 in the compact liquid phase may be associated with the fisher - widom curve marking the transition in the long - range decay of the correlation function from a monotonic fluidlike character to an oscillatory solidlike character .",
    "generally , further study of @xmath0 might provide insight not only into the nature of thermodynamic curvature , but add another set of criteria to use in judging the quality of fits of fluid data to fitting models .",
    "i thank peter mausbach , helge - otmar may , horst meyer , anurag sahay , tapobrata sarkar , guatam sengupta , and steven shipman for useful communications .",
    "very special thanks to eric lemmon for programming @xmath0 into refprop 9.01 ( @xmath52 test version ) .",
    "significant aspects of this paper hinge on the behavior of @xmath0 in the asymptotic critical region .",
    "below , i work in the context of the scaled form of the free energy , with the rehr and mermin @xcite mixing of scaling variables to deal with asymmetry .",
    "this constitutes the  currently accepted asymptotic scaling description of fluid criticality  @xcite . in this appendix",
    ", i prove that @xmath0 has the same critical exponent as @xmath4 along the coexistence curve and its analytic extension into the supercritical regime .",
    "i also prove the commensurate @xmath0 theorem that @xmath0 in the coexisting liquid and vapor phases are equal .    my proofs assume that along the coexistence curve @xmath53 is analytic approaching the critical point from below . this assumption has been questioned in the context of the yang - yang anomaly where the second derivative @xmath54 diverges at the critical point .",
    "there is some experimental evidence @xcite for this point of view which requires ",
    "complete scaling  to address theoretically . in this scenario",
    ", my proofs would require revisions .",
    "@xmath62 are the values of @xmath63 at the critical point , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two constants .",
    "i assume @xmath66 , the case if the fluid is not too antisymmetric .",

    "these branches join smoothly along the curve @xmath69 , except at the critical point @xmath70 .",

    "( [ 2110 ] ) to diverge on approaching the critical point , assuming critical exponent values in the vicinity of the pure fluid ones ( @xmath103 @xcite ) . therefore , since the regular part of the pressure @xmath56 produces only finite second derivatives in the metric elements , we can drop it in calculating @xmath0 in the asymptotic critical region .",
    "demonstrating that @xmath107 diverges with exponent @xmath74 .",
    "this exponent is the same as that of @xmath4 @xcite . to assure a positive heat capacity",
    ", we must have @xmath108 , yielding @xmath109 for fluids .",
    "this is found in every case considered in this paper .",
    "note also that @xmath113 diverges with exponent @xmath74 , the same as that of @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of the term @xmath114 in eq .",
