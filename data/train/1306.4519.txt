    "the study of causality is a long - standing topic at the interface of statistics and the philosophy of science .",
    "it is also an area where the mathematical analysis of graphical models has led to some important recent advances ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate a particular class of symmetric causal processes which achieves two apparently conflicting requirements ( ` independence ' and ` influence ' defined shortly ) .    in section  [ sec : background ] , we provide formal definitions , but give the main ideas here to facilitate the discussion .",
    "let @xmath4 be @xmath0 dichotomous ( two states ) random variables with the same state spaces , which we call ` effects ' and let @xmath5 be @xmath0 independent dichotomous random variables , also with the same state spaces , which we call ` causes ' .",
    "we say that a cause @xmath6 ` influences ' effect @xmath7 if there exists at least one assignment of states for the remaining causes such that a change in the state of @xmath6 changes the ( conditional ) probability of at least one state of the @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "` independence ' refers to pair - wise probabilistic independence of the effects ( either absolutely , or conditional on knowing the state of any one cause ) .",
    "we explore a symmetric system because it is applicable to any scenario in which the probability of @xmath8 depends just on how many causes take the same value as @xmath6",
    ". we can view this process as a game where we identify @xmath6 with the action of some player @xmath9 ; the outcome for each player @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath8 ) then depends solely on how many of the other players chose the same action .",
    "for example , suppose there are @xmath0 flowering plants in an area of study .",
    "for plant @xmath9 , the cause @xmath6 might describe whether the plant flowers early or late . the corresponding effect @xmath8 could denote whether or not a plant is pollinated .",
    "for example , flowering early with many other flowers might be advantageous because such a mass flowering attracts more bees and increases the probability the plant is pollinated .",
    "on the other hand , there may be a limit in the number of bees , so flowering at the same time as a smaller number of plants may also be advantageous .",
    "either way , the probability of an effect ( pollination of plant @xmath9 ) depends on the number of causes which match the cause of that particular effect ( i.e. how many other plants flower at the same time as plant @xmath9 ) .    recently , such processes have been studied in the philosophy of science literature as they provide insights into the extent to which subsets of causes can render effects independent ( theorem 5b of @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite illustrated such a process with an entertaining application involving @xmath0 people playing a tequila drinking game . in",
    "@xcite they consider just the case @xmath10 . in the game , the @xmath0 people simultaneously and independently reveal a clenched fist or an open hand ( with equal probability ) , and the states of the @xmath0 hands are regarded as the @xmath0 causes . the event that person @xmath9 drinks tequila is @xmath8 , for @xmath11 .",
    "the rules for determining if person @xmath8 drinks when @xmath10 are that if a player s hand position is unique then they drink with probability @xmath12 .",
    "for the ties ( e.g. a tie of two or three ) , those in the tie drink independently with probability @xmath13 when there are two people in the tie and probability @xmath14 when there are three people in the tie ( see fig .  [ hands ] ) .",
    "the probabilities used here are quite special when we consider influence and independence in relation to each other and the effect on the system .",
    "we study what is special and how it can generalize .",
    "we call this extension of this game to @xmath0 players the ` generalized symmetric tequila problem ' ( gst ) but , as noted in the previous paragraph , the relevance of such processes extends well beyond bar drinking games .    ; including @xmath15 from @xcite , and @xmath16 from section  [ explicit2 ] ; see text for details . ]",
    "our main results assume the system has some symmetry , as explained at the beginning of section  [ sec : polynomials ] and we define three spaces in this context : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these spaces are formally defined in section  [ sec : polynomials ] but , in short , are the set of probabilities for the fully symmetric system which lead to influence , independence and both , respectively .",
    "we fully analyze the case @xmath10 ( section  [ sec : polynomials ] ) , we establish a useful equivalence relation on @xmath18 ( section  [ sec : geometry ] ) , we show that @xmath18 is contractible ( section  [ sec : topology ] ) but not convex ( section  [ sec : geometry ] ) , and that @xmath20 is neither .",
    "we establish a characterization ( proposition  [ prop : influence ] ) for the system to be in @xmath17 .",
    "we show , via a quadratic form and its hessian matrix , that @xmath20 contains infinitely many points for any @xmath21 .",
    "we use this structure to investigate the topology and geometry of the space @xmath20 , with a main objective being to determine whether or not it is connected .",
    "we show that @xmath20 is disconnected for @xmath22 and connected when @xmath23 in theorem  [ gstconnected ] and corollary  [ cor : connected ] .",
    "the remaining cases where @xmath24 seems an interesting question for future study .",
    "our results involve an interplay of linear algebra , analysis , combinatorics and topology , including some classical results in these fields , such as sylvester s inertia theorem , alexander duality and smith s theorem on periodic maps .",
    "we begin by giving the formal set - up of the system of causes and effects , and proceed to provide formal definitions of influence , and conditional independence .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be random variables with two possible states ( also called ` dichotomous ' ) , labeled throughout this paper as @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( although our results do not depend on this ) .",
    "we assume that the @xmath6 are ( mutually ) independent , and each event @xmath7 depend on the outcome of the events @xmath6 ; accordingly we call the @xmath6 _ causes _ and the @xmath7 _ effects_. to simplify notation , we write conditional probabilities of the form @xmath29 more simply as @xmath30 ( i.e. @xmath31 is the event that @xmath8 ` occurs ' ) .",
    "the model we study makes the following assumptions :    * the causes are ( mutually ) independent , with @xmath32 for some @xmath33 . *",
    "the effects are conditionally independent , given the joint outcome of the causes .",
    "@xmath34    property ( a2 ) states that the probability of @xmath8 depends only on the number of causes that are in the same state as @xmath6 . flowers often seem to flower with some dependence on the number of other flowers which have also flowered . in the tequila example , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in this paper",
    "we will mostly deal with the case where @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( the fully - symmetric ( or gst ) model ) , but it is helpful to pose the problem more generally .      while the set - up we explore has the same number of causes as effects , we give the definitions here for arbitrary numbers of causes and effects .",
    "@xcite[def : influence ] a set of @xmath39 causes _ influences _ a set of @xmath41 effects if for each cause @xmath6 , there exists as least one assignment of states for the remaining @xmath42 causes , such that some change in the state of @xmath6 , while holding the values of the remaining @xmath43 causes fixed , changes the probability of at least one state of each of the @xmath41 effects .",
    "the influence condition is equivalent to the requirement that none of the causes can be eliminated for any effect  that is , for each @xmath9 , there is no proper subset @xmath44 of @xmath45 for which @xmath46 can be written as a function of @xmath47 , for all @xmath48 .",
    "we also study probabilistic independence .",
    "recall that two random variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent with respect to a third random variable @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 . in the language of causality and graphical models we would say that @xmath51 _ screens off _ @xmath49 from @xmath50 .",
    "this language is natural when looking at graphical models and , to be consistent with that literature , we will use this phrasing as well .",
    "the _ independence condition _ is then the requirement that each cause screens off each effect from any other effect .",
    "for example , in the tequila drinking game , any cause @xmath53 screens off any pair of effects as @xmath54 . however , the reason this example is of interest in  @xcite is because any pair of causes @xmath55 do not screen @xmath8 from @xmath7 for any pair @xmath56 and yet the set of all three causes screens off any pair of events .",
    "this provides a contrast to what happens when @xmath1 . in that case ,",
    "theorem 2 of @xcite shows that neither of two dichotomous causes can screen off @xmath57 from @xmath58 ( i.e. the independence condition fails ) whenever the two causes :    * have non - zero joint probability for any combination of states , * together screen off @xmath57 from @xmath58 , and * each influence @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we might also wonder whether , when @xmath59 , we can strengthen the independence condition to apply when we condition on more than one cause . however , there is a limit to the extent to which we can do this if we wish to also maintain influence , due to the following result , which follows directly from corollary 2 of @xcite .",
    "[ ssresult ] for any model that satisfies ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) , influence and independence , any two effects are dependent once we specify the values of any subset of the causes of size @xmath60 .",
    "the symmetric setting where @xmath38 and @xmath61 for all @xmath62 is of particular interest , as it is tractable and leads to some interesting results when we couple influence with independence .",
    "we call the model where @xmath38 and @xmath61 the _ generalized symmetric tequila _ ( gst ) setting , as it generalizes the tequila example in  @xcite , where @xmath2 .",
    "we note that taking @xmath63 is the natural choice for symmetric games where it is beneficial to each player play a minority action ( for example , if @xmath38 is decreasing with @xmath39 ) , as this provides a nash equilibrium strategy .",
    "we explore the case @xmath2 further to characterize all the solutions satisfying influence and independence , before turning to general values of @xmath0 as it serves to further understand the example in  @xcite , it serves as a ` boundary ' example for larger @xmath0 and we return to this example throughout the text .",
    "firstly , notice that in the gst setting , @xmath64 takes the same value for each choice of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( this probability is given formally in the proof of proposition  [ psiprop ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath8 and @xmath67 are ( pairwise ) independent , for any pair @xmath68 ( including @xmath69 ) .",
    "if influence applies then @xmath8 ` depends on ' @xmath67 ( and the other causes ) but this does not translate through to probabilistic independence .",
    "a second basic observation in the gst setting is that symmetry gives the following : @xmath70 therefore , effects @xmath8 and @xmath7 are independent if and only if any single cause @xmath53 screens off the two effects .    in the gst",
    "setting , the conditions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , coupled with influence and independence , can be stated more succinctly as :    * the causes represent independent tosses of a fair coin ; * the effects are mutually ( probabilistically ) independent once we specify the states of all the causes ; * the probability of @xmath8 depends ( exactly ) on the number of causes that take the same value as @xmath6 ; * each pair of effects is ( probabilistically ) independent ; * each cause can influence each effect .",
    "in the case where @xmath1 , it is easy to verify that any process that satisfies properties ( i)(iv ) must have @xmath71 and so must fail to satisfy the influence condition ( v ) .",
    "the case where @xmath2 is more interesting .",
    "we study independence by studying the following equation , which follows from direct computation or eqn .",
    "( [ eq : gstindependence ] ) , assuming @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 notice that @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 is a solution to the final equation which corresponds to the solution presented for the original tequila game in @xcite . also observe that the space of probabilities leading to independence consists of two planes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3planes ] .",
    "( green ) where influence fails , and the plane @xmath78 ( blue ) where independence holds . ]",
    "further , any solution with @xmath79 corresponding to the vanishing of the first term @xmath80 in eqn .",
    "( [ nis3 ] ) fails to satisfy the influence property .",
    "this is an easy example to work through but also follows from the more general proposition  [ prop : influence ] below .",
    "the intersection of the two planes is @xmath81 , where influence clearly fails . for the remaining points on the plane @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath83 which implies influence ( again easy to work through or use proposition  [ prop : influence ] below ) .",
    "therefore the space of probabilities satisfying both influence and independence for @xmath10 consists of two connected pieces formed by removing the line @xmath84 from the plane @xmath82 ( the fact that this space is disconnected also follows from theorem  [ gstconnected ] and corollary  [ cor : connected ] ) .      for the fully symmetric model we can characterize when the system has influence .",
    "first , however , a brief discussion of influence is useful .",
    "we say a particular cause @xmath67 influences a particular effect @xmath8 if there exists an assignment of states for the remaining @xmath85 causes such that changing the state of @xmath67 changes the probability of at least one state of @xmath8 .",
    "we might consider two types of influence :    * for every @xmath11 , the cause @xmath6 influences the effect @xmath8 . * for every @xmath86 , the cause @xmath6 influences the effect @xmath7 .",
    "the statement ( @xmath87 ) matches definition  [ def : influence ] and is stronger than ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , in thinking about applications , like the flowers blooming early versus late , we are largely concerned with the flower s cause influencing its own effect which is likely to be subject to natural selection . in the symmetric case ,",
    "these two types of influence are equivalent , which we establish in the next proposition , along with a characterization of influence in terms of the probabilities @xmath89 .",
    "[ prop : influence ] assume the gst setting , so @xmath73 and @xmath90 .",
    "then the following are equivalent :    * the system satisfies ( @xmath88 ) ; * the system satisfies ( @xmath87 ) ; * there exists @xmath91 $ ] such that @xmath92 .",
    "we argue that ( i ) @xmath93 ( iii ) @xmath93 ( ii ) @xmath93 ( i ) . if a system satisfies ( @xmath87 ) , it obviously satisfies ( @xmath88 ) , so ( ii ) @xmath93 ( i ) .",
    "( ( i ) @xmath93 ( iii ) ) we prove the contrapositive .",
    "assume that @xmath94 for all @xmath95 .",

    "finally , we set @xmath139 while our discussion is entirely in the gst setting , when talking about subsets of @xmath140^n$ ] we will only use @xmath20 when the system has both influence and independence .",
    "before we dig deep into the geometric and topological structure of @xmath20 , we show the space is non - empty by explicitly establishing a few useful points in the space , starting with @xmath18 and moving on to points that are in @xmath20 .",
    "the quadratic form discussed in the next section gives us an easy way , from details in the proof of theorem  [ gstconnected ] , to show that there are infinitely many points in @xmath20 .",
    "however , we found the following explicit points useful for proving that both @xmath20 and @xmath18 are not convex .",
    "these examples also illustrate the challenge of trying to write down explicit points .      if @xmath141 for all @xmath142 then any two events @xmath8 and @xmath7 , where @xmath143 , are independent ( equivalently , they are screened off by a single cause @xmath53 for any @xmath144 ) , i.e. @xmath145 .",
    "it is relatively easy to establish this fact explicitly , but it also follows directly from the fact that @xmath113 is a quadratic form and @xmath146 is an eigenvector for its hessian matrix with eigenvalue @xmath27 ( see section  [ sec : quadform ] and proposition  [ eigenvalues ] ) .",
    "this point fails influence by proposition  [ prop : influence ] .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath0 is odd , easy computations show that @xmath147 ( for @xmath9 odd ) and @xmath148 ( for @xmath9 even ) , where @xmath149 satisfies independence .",
    "however , this also fails the influence requirement , since when @xmath0 is odd , @xmath9 is odd / even if and only if @xmath150 is odd / even and therefore proposition  [ prop : influence ] implies no influence .",
    "an alternative approach to try to achieve independence and influence simultaneously using two parameters @xmath151 is to select @xmath152 so that influence applies , and then attempt to enforce independence .",
    "for example , if we select some @xmath153 where @xmath154 and define @xmath152 by setting : @xmath155 then it is clear from proposition  [ prop : influence ] that influence holds .",
    "however , it is easy to show that independence fails in this case , illustrating how challenging it can be to write down points in @xmath20 explicitly .      in the next two subsections",
    "we explicitly compute points in @xmath20 which are particularly useful for showing that @xmath18 is not convex .",
    "for the first set of points set @xmath156 for some @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath158 for all @xmath143 , which implies influence .",
    "we claim there exists at least one @xmath159 that implies independence of effects .",
    "since we are in the gst setting we use eqn .",

    "( [ eq : theta1 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "of course , @xmath163 is a solution but it fails to satisfy influence , by proposition  [ prop : influence ] .",
    "so we study the equation @xmath164    for @xmath10 , we can explore the structure in two ways , using either eqn .",

    "therefore , for @xmath10 , there is one value of @xmath159 which is stochastic and all the probabilities involved are distinct , so the causes influence the effects ( i.e. the system satisfies influence ) .",
