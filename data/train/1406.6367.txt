    "while charge conjugation ( c ) and parity ( p ) are not exact symmetries of the standard model of particle physics , present data  @xcite are consistent with the higgs particle being the standard model ( sm ) scalar  @xcite , which is defined as a cp - even @xmath6 doublet scalar . nevertheless , in the plausible perspective that particle physics is not at the end of the road and beyond the sm physics ( bsm ) is awaiting discovery as an explanation of the electroweak hierarchy problem , it is necessary to track the possible non - doublet and/or cp - odd components of the observed resonance , in particular in view of the sizeable present error bars .",
    "this is underway through different complementary strategies : kinematical analysis , direct searches of new resonances expected in particular bsm theories , or indirect signals other than kinematic ones .",

    "moreover , the present lhc data offer increasingly rich and precise constraints on gauge and gauge - higgs couplings , up to the point of becoming competitive with fermionic bounds in constraining bsm theories ; this trend may be further strengthened with the post - lhc facilities presently under discussion .",
