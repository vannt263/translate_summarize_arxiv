    "experiments with radioactive ion beams ( rib ) started a new era in the nuclear reaction physics for the last decades @xcite .",
    "with regard to probing and understanding the nuclear structure , in these experiments , some unexpected properties of the nucleus have been discovered .",
    "one of the most intriguing attributes is the halo structure @xcite , consisting of a core and a weakly - bound valance nucleon(s ) to this core . up to now , this phenomenon has been greatly investigated experimentally on the various targets @xcite and caused a challenge for nuclear reaction theoreticians to reproduce the experimental data @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is one of the four one - neutron halo nuclei together with @xmath3 @xcite , and newly reported @xmath4 @xcite , and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "some experiments has been conducted for understanding of structure of @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , tanihata et .",
    "al @xcite observed a large radii for @xmath0 compared to @xmath2 in cross section measurements with targets at 90 mev / a , and concluded the halo structure for @xmath0 originating from its small neutron separation energy of 0.503 mev .",
    "a few years later , fukuda et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed this conclusion in elastic scattering of @xmath0 on c and al targets at 33 mev / nucleon . since these distinguished works",
    ", @xmath0 has been still studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "one experimental study about @xmath0 is performed by cortina - gil et al .",
    "@xcite for the cross section of the elastic scattering on @xmath1 at 49.3 mev / nucleon incident energy .",
    "the first theoretical investigation of this measurement is an adiabatic approximation assuming no internal motion between the valance nucleon and the core in projectile , and also neglecting the interactions between the valance nucleon and the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "also , in the same year , al - khalili et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the same reaction with the few - body glauber model , in which the particles of the projectile are considered as following straight line paths through the interaction field of the target .",
    "in addition to these studies , the continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) method was applied to this elastic scattering by takashina et .",
    "@xcite , and also they used the same parameter set for the optical potentials between the projectile components and the target as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this non - adiabatic method , due to the very low neutron or proton separation energy , the continuum states of the projectile above this threshold energy",
    "are discretized to finite number of states using momentum bins . including the breakup effects into the theoretical calculations of mentioned methods",
    "gives almost the same results .",
    "in the present study , the elastic scattering of the projectile halo nucleus @xmath0 on the target @xmath1 at 49.3 mev / nucleon @xcite is investigated as a breakup reaction using the optical model with the aid of a nuclear structure model .",
    "different from other studies , the optical model potential used for the interaction between the core nucleus @xmath2 and the target @xmath1 is obtained by fitting to elastic cross section data at 39.1 mev / nucleon .",
    "this data @xcite is investigated with optical model for the first time in this study . as for the interaction between the valance neutron of the halo nucleus and the target ,",
    "the optical potential is deduced from an interpolation for different incident energies of neutron on @xmath1 target by means of global potential of ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to describe non - elastic contributions",
    ", we use a surface potential , which can be named as dpp ( dynamical polarization potential ) or vcp ( virtual coupling potential ) , in our calculations .",
    "finally , a binding potential is employed for n+@xmath2 system .",
    "unlike similar studies , we determine the value of the spectroscopic factor , describing the wave function of @xmath0 in terms of the wave function of @xmath2 , with the method given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the direct neutron capture reaction @xmath2+@xmath6+@xmath7",
    ". however , we use a new nuclear level density ( nld ) model @xcite , which strongly depends on the deformation of nucleus .",
    "this paper organized as follows : the method used in this study is presented in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , the results obtained by this method are given for the breakup reaction of @xmath0 in sec . [ results ] , and finally in sec . [ conclusions ] , concluding remarks drawn from this study are given .",
    "since the mid - fifties , the optical model has been greatly used to investigate the elastic scattering cross section for both light and heavy ions in a wide range of incident energy .",
    "the optical model considers the projectile and the target nuclei as the structureless particles in order to avoid many - body problems in nuclear physics calculations , and describes the interaction between the projectile and target with an effective potential . in this work , since we included breakup effects , the halo projectile @xmath0 is considered as a two - body system , which consists of @xmath2 core and a valance neutron . therefore , we define the effective potentials between projectile components and the target @xmath1 , which are n+@xmath1 , @xmath2+@xmath1 and n+@xmath2 as used ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath8 where c , t , v correspond to @xmath2 core , @xmath1 target and valance nucleon , respectively .",
    "an effective potential is a combination of the following terms as @xmath9 the first term is the centrifugal potential , which is defined as @xmath10 traditionally .",
    "uniformly charged sphere assumption is employed for nucleus , @xmath11 where the charge radius @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 , the coulomb potential parameter @xmath14 is taken as 1.2 fm in this work . in the optical model ,",
    "the volume term in a effective potential has a crucial role and can be described with the real part of this term .",
    "however , for inelastic contributions , an imaginary part is added to the volume term for the purpose of considering absorption of the reaction flux from the elastic channel to inelastic reaction channels .",
    "therefore , conventionally the volume term consists of real and imaginary parts in reaction studies , @xmath15 where potential depths , radius and surface diffuseness parameters for both real and imaginary parts should be adjusted elastic scattering data . even if the investigated reaction is the elastic scattering , non - elastic contributions can still exist in the elastic channels . to include these contributions ,",
    "the surface potential are used @xmath16 which is in derivative form of the volume term . final term in eq .",
    "is the spin - orbit potential @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the optical potential parameters in these equations can be determined from elastic scattering data . as a first step in fitting procedure of potential parameters ,",
    "the geometrical parameters are adjusted to positions of peaks occurred in data .",
    "afterwards , the potential depths of all used optical model potentials are fitted to experimental data to give the minimum @xmath19 value .    in the case of halo nucleus",
    "@xmath0 , the spectroscopic factor as a structure property is used to describe the ground state and the first excited state of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the spectroscopic factor can be determined from the fitting to experimental cross section data of transfer or direct capture processes , and also they can be obtained theoretically from the shell model calculations . in literature , many transfer processes include the spectroscopic factor value of @xmath0 for @xmath20(t , p)@xmath0 @xcite , @xmath2(d , p)@xmath0 @xcite and @xmath0(p , d)@xmath2 @xcite reactions",
    ". however , the experimental data of the direct capture cross section for @xmath2(n,@xmath7)@xmath0 is not available , but the direct capture cross section data can be deduced from coulomb dissociation @xcite . as a tool for calculations of the light ion cross sections such as direct capture processes , the nuclear level density has a crucial role to reproduce the measured data and define the spectroscopic factor .",
    "therefore , the relation between the direct capture cross section and the nuclear level density , which is the number of the excited levels around an excitation energy , can be defined as @xcite @xmath21 where s represents the average spectroscopic factor , and @xmath22 is the level density function in terms of the excitation energy @xmath23 , total angular momentum @xmath24 , and the parity @xmath25 of compound nucleus . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the direct neutron capture cross section and compare to deduced data @xcite from coulomb dissociation of @xmath0 measured by nakamura et .",
    "al . @xcite . to do this calculation ,",
    "laplace - like formula @xcite is used for the energy dependence of the nuclear level density parameter in fermi gas model . according to this formula the level density parameter",
    "strongly depends on the deformation of the nucleus , and the results obtained with this formula are very successful to describe low - lying collective levels compared to other phenomenological level density models @xcite .",
    "therefore , keeping in mind that @xmath2 and @xmath0 are well - deformed nuclei , we expect that this formula is convenient to explain the neutron capture cross section data of @xmath2 . in the following section",
    ", we will give the optical potential parameters , which are used in this study , and the results of our calculations .",
    "to describe the interactions between the projectile and target , we consider the weakly - bound nucleus @xmath0 as @xmath2+n on @xmath1 target . for this purpose , firstly we focus on the interaction between the neutron and the target",
    ". great number of experimental data in 0 - 100 mev energy range @xcite is found for the elastic scattering of neutron on @xmath1 , and can be used to define the effective potential between the valance nucleon and the target for in case @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , for 49.3 mev incident energy , no experimental data is available .",
    "thus , an interpolation of the global parametrization @xcite is used .",
    "the results obtained with this global potential are given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "as seen from figure , this interpolation of the global parametrization for n+@xmath1 at 49.3 mev incident energy gives us a good agreement in wide range energy .",

    "@xcite in which they measured the elastic cross section for @xmath2 and @xmath0 projectiles on proton and @xmath1 targets at 39.1 mev / nucleon and 38.4 mev / nucleon , respectively , and these data was investigated using the microscopic jeukenne - lejeune - mahaux nucleon - nucleus potential for proton target and framework of folding model for c target .",
    "unlike the other studies , @xcite in order to be more physical and reliable , the potential parameters describing the interaction between the core and the target are adjusted to the elastic scattering data at 39.1 mev / nucleon energy @xcite .",
    "our obtained values of the potential depth parameters are shallow compared to their potential .",
    "we use the experimental @xmath27 quadrupole deformation value , which is -0.6 @xcite , for the first @xmath28 excited level of @xmath1 , which is 4.4 mev .",
    "also , in order to take into account the non - elastic contributions caused from the interactions at surface region , additionally one can add the surface term into the effective potential .",
    "this potential is sometimes referred as surface term , derivative of woods - saxon potential form , dpp and vcp , and can be obtained by different methods .",
    "the parameters of dpp can be obtained from microscopical @xcite or phenomenological @xcite calculations by fitting to the experimental data . for @xmath2+@xmath1",

    "many authors analysed the elastic scattering of the halo - nuclues @xmath0 on target @xmath1 for this incident energy by different theoretical models @xcite .",
    "however , none of these studies is incorporated the nuclear structure to explain the data . on the other hand , adding the nuclear structural information into the reaction calculations for such a weakly - bound system as the halo nucleus is played a crucial role to contribute the agreement between the predictions and the experimental data .",
    "the spectroscopic factor as a nuclear structure property is one of the most important ingredients for the theoretical cross section calculations of both light and heavy ions .",
    "there are many methods which can be used for determining the value of the spectroscopic factor .",
    "of course , the easiest method is to fit the spectroscopic factor values to the experimental cross section data directly , but the traditional way of estimating spectroscopic factor is to use the shell model in which the spectroscopic factor is defined as the square of normalization of the overlap integral between the wave function of the valance nucleon in the state of the target nucleus and the residual nucleus . also , the spectroscopic factor is a key ingredient for the direct capture process for which the related cross section often dominates the total cross section at the very low energies of astrophysical interest .",
    "the direct capture process is can be used for obtaining the spectroscopic factor and known to play a notable role for light exotic nuclei systems for which few , or even no resonant states are available .",
    "although many works containing the spectroscopic factors derived from the transfer processes are existing for the halo nucleus @xmath0 , the direct neutron capture cross section data for @xmath2 to compose @xmath0 is not available in the literature .",

    "the deduced experimental data from coulomb dissociation data of @xmath0 @xcite is taken from ref .",
    "]    in obtaining the spectroscopic factor with the aid of the direct capture cross section calculations , the most important component is the nuclear level density .",
    "generally , the reasons for not trusting to level density models to use in such calculations are their insufficient agreements with the experimental observables and their way of taking into account the collective effects . for overcoming these challenges , recently , we introduced a new laplace - like formula @xcite for the nld parameter to improve the predictive power for describing the low - lying collective levels , which are well known to be of vital importance for the direct capture process . with this formula ,",
    "a great agreement is achieved with the experimental observables .",
    "therefore , the direct neutron capture cross section calculation based on this level density model for @xmath2(n+@xmath7)@xmath0 processes is shown in figure [ fig3 ] . although the data could not be reproduced below 0.5 mev , in the rest of the energy range the same behaviour is well explained .",
    "the obtained average value for the spectroscopic factor is 1.48 .",

    "@xcite which is 0.71 for the ground state and 0.62 for the first excited state , respectively . the results of this calculation is also shown in figure [ fig4 ] with dashed blue line . in our calculations",
    "the average value of the spectroscopic factor is taken as the spectroscopic factor of the ground state .",
    "since the spectroscopic factor of the first excited state has less effect on the results , the value of this factor is taken as 1.0 .",
    "finally , our prediction for the elastic scattering cross section of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is shown in figure [ fig4 ] with solid red line .",
    "as seen from this figure , the inclusion of the nuclear level density with the laplace - like formula in the reaction calculations has a very well effect on reproducing the cross section data .",
    "also , the fit method we used for the optical potential parameters , which is to adjust the geometrical parameters to positions of peaks and the depths to give minimum @xmath19 , effects the agreement in a positive way .",

    "also , the present study contains the first analysis of the phenomenological optical model for 39.1 mev incident energy of the projectile @xmath2 on @xmath1 target .",
    "obtained results are in better agreement compared to the microscopic study of lapoux et al @xcite , which is the first and the only study of this reaction .",
    "not only the effect of including the spectroscopic factor into calculations are found significant for the breakup reaction of @xmath0 but also adjusting the geometrical parameters to positions of peaks and the depths to give minimum @xmath19 gives positives contributions to reproduce the scattering data .    the theoretical framework used for obtaining the spectroscopic factor by using the nuclear nuclear level density to calculate the direct neutron capture cross section",
    "is employed for the first time in breakup reaction calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the nuclear level density is used for the first time as a spectroscopic tool in a light exotic nuclei induced reaction .",
    "consequently , beside the success of the nuclear level density with the laplace - like formula for the level density parameter @xcite as a structure model , the results show that this new method seems appropriate to perform the reaction calculations .",
