    "how galaxies form and evolve remains one of the most interesting and challenging puzzles in astronomy .",
    "although a great deal of progress has been made in the last decade many questions await to be addressed .",
    "both , theory and observations are now converging about a key ingredient of this formation process ; galaxies as our own milky way seem to have experienced the accretion of smaller objects that have come together thanks to the relentless pull of gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the observational side ,",
    "several new studies have revealed the presence of a large amount of stellar streams in galactic stellar haloes , echoes of ancient as well as recent and ongoing accretion events .",
    "these stellar streams have been preferentially found in the outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the sagittarius tidal streams @xcite and the orphan stream @xcite are just two examples of satellite debris in the milky way ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the abundant substructures found not only in the halo of m31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also in several haloes of other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are an unambiguous proof that accretion is inherent to the process of galaxy formation .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "models of the formation of stellar haloes in the @xmath1cdm cosmogony have been able to explain their gross structural properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models ,",
    "the inner regions of the haloes ( including the solar neighbourhood ) typically formed first and hence contain information about the most ancient accretion events that the galaxy has experienced .",
    "previous studies have predicted that several hundreds kinematically cold stellar streams should be present in the solar vicinity @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of these streams is quite challenging especially because of the small size of the samples of halo stars with accurate 3-d velocities currently available .",
    "full phase - space information is necessary because of the very short mixing time - scales in the inner regions of the halo .",
    "some progress has been made towards building such a catalogue but only a few detections have been reported to date @xcite .",
    "these have made use of catalogues such as segue @xcite and rave @xcite in combination with tycho @xcite and hipparcos @xcite .",
    "clearly , this field will only advance significantly with the launch of the astrometric satellite _ gaia _ @xcite .",
    "this mission from the european space agency will provide accurate measurements of the 6-d phase - space coordinates of an extraordinarily large number of stars .",
    "together with positions , proper motions and parallaxes of all stars brighter than @xmath2 , _ gaia _ will also measure radial velocities down to a magnitude of @xmath3 .    to unravel the accretion history of the milky way",
    "requires the development of theoretical tools that will ultimately allow the identification and characterization of the substructure present in the _ gaia _ data set .",
    "several authors have studied the suitability of various spaces to isolate debris from accretion events ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite , followed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gh10 ) , showed that orbital frequencies form a very suitable space in which to identify debris from past merger events . in frequency space individual streams from an accreted satellite can be easily identified , and their separation provides a direct measurement of its time of accretion .",
    "furthermore , gh10 showed for a few idealized gravitational potentials that these features are preserved also in systems that have evolved strongly in time . while very promising , these studies have focused on a single accretion event onto a host galaxy . in reality , we expect the galactic stellar halo to have formed as a result of multiple merger events ( where most of its mass should have originated in a handful of significant contributors ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , it is likely that debris from different satellites will overlap in frequency space , complicating their detection .    in this paper",
    "we follow multiple accretion events in a live ( cosmologically motivated ) galactic gravitational potential .",
    "we focus on how the latest estimates of the measurement errors expected for the _ gaia _ mission will affect our ability to recover these events .",
    "in particular we study the distribution of stellar streams in frequency space and the determination of satellite s time since accretion from stellar particles located in a region like the solar neighbourhood .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the details of the @xmath0-body simulations carried out , as well as the steps taken to generate a mock _ gaia _ stellar catalogue . in section 3",
    "we characterize the distribution of debris in a solar neighbourhood - like sphere in the absence of measurement errors , while in section 4 we focus on the analysis of the mock _ gaia _ catalogue .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "we model the formation of the stellar halo of the milky way using @xmath0-body simulations of the disruption and accretion of luminous satellites onto a time - dependent galactic potential .",
    "we describe firstly the characteristics of the galactic potential and of the population of satellites , as well as the @xmath0-body simulations .",

    "after accretion , produces a stellar halo with this total luminosity , we use the luminosity distribution function of the milky way satellites given by @xcite @xmath32 figure  [ fig : lum_fun ] shows the luminosity function of our model satellite population obtained by randomly drawing 42 objects .    for the initial stellar structure of the satellites",

    "( see * ? ? ? * for a complete review of recent measurements of these parameters . ) here for simplicity , we shall assume @xmath45 ( as the halo appears to be rather concentrated ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . at the solar radius , @xmath48  kpc",
    ", @xmath43 corresponds to the local stellar halo density . in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath49 m@xmath11  kpc@xmath50 , as given by @xcite .    from this density profile",
    "we randomly draw positions at redshift @xmath51 for the guiding orbit of each one of our satellites . to generate their velocities",
    "we follow the method described in section 2.1 of @xcite .",
    "the main assumption made is that the stellar halo can be modelled by a radially anisotropic phase - space distribution function , which is only a function of energy , @xmath52 , and angular momentum , @xmath37 .",
    "this combined set of orbital initial conditions guarantees that at @xmath53 , the observed stellar halo density profile and velocity ellipsoid at the solar radius are roughly matched by our model .",
    "these initial conditions are then integrated backwards in time for @xmath54  gyr ( @xmath55 ) in the time - dependent potential described in section  [ pots ] .",
    "therefore , we now have obtained the set of initial positions and velocities required for forward integration in time of our @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we do not include any numerical treatment of dynamical friction in our simulations .",
    "therefore , and to mimic the effects of this process , we have assigned the five most bound orbits at present time to the five most massive satellites . for the rest of the satellites",
    "the orbits are assigned randomly .",
    "the numerical simulations are , in most cases , self - consistently evolved using the massively parallel treesph code gadget-2.0 @xcite .",
    "the number of particles used to simulate each satellite depends on its total luminosity , as explained bellow ( section  [ sec : mock_cat ] ) .",
    "this number ranges from a minimum of @xmath56 up to @xmath57 particles . to avoid very large computational times we neglect self - gravity for the five most massive satellites .",
    "we do not expect this to significantly affect our results since these satellites inhabit the inner regions of the host ( see section  [ sec : orb_prop ] ) and therefore they are rapidly disrupted . for the gravitational softening parameter",
    "we choose @xmath58 ( where @xmath35 is the core radius of the system ) . after allowing each satellite to relax in isolation for @xmath59  gyr , we launch it from the apocentre of its orbit and let it evolve for @xmath54  gyr under the influence of the time - dependent galactic potential .        to generate a mock _ gaia _",
    "catalogue we need to ` transform ' our @xmath0-body particles into ` stars ' .",
    "therefore we assign absolute magnitudes , colours and spectral types to each particle in our simulations .",
    "we use the iac - star code @xcite which generates synthetic colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for a desired stellar population model . as output",
    "we obtain the @xmath60 and @xmath61 colour for each stellar particle .",
    "we assign to each satellite a stellar population model @xcite with a range of ages from @xmath62 to @xmath63  gyr , @xmath64 \\leq -1.5 $ ] dex , @xmath65 = 0.3 $ ] , and a kroupa initial mass function @xcite .",
    "all these parameters are consistent with the observed values in the galactic stellar halo ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "an example of the resulting cmd is shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ]    due to the limited resolution of our @xmath0-body simulations it is not possible to fully populate the cmds of our satellites .",
    "therefore each satellite is populated only with stars brighter than @xmath66 , which corresponds to an apparent magnitude @xmath67 at @xmath68  kpc from the sun .",
    "this choice represents a good compromise between the numerical resolution of our simulations and the limiting apparent magnitude @xmath69 for which _ gaia _ will measure full 6d phase - space coordinates ( astrometric and photometric measurements extend to @xmath70 , but spectroscopic measurements reach @xmath71 ) .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : int_prop ] different satellites have different total luminosities and , thus , the number of stars down to magnitude @xmath72 varies from object to object .",
    "therefore , in each satellite a different number of @xmath0-body particles is converted into stars .",
    "to estimate this number we use the cmd code by @xcite , which provides a stellar luminosity function normalized to the initial stellar mass of a given population . the age and metallicity of the stellar population model",
    "is fixed to the average values described above and the initial mass is set by the total luminosity of each satellite .",
    "finally , accumulating the number of stars down to @xmath73 we obtain the number of @xmath0-body particles that need to be transformed into stars .",
    "this number range from 660 for the faintest satellite ( @xmath74 ) to @xmath75 for the brightest one ( @xmath76 ) .    ) .,width=309 ]      the _ gaia _ catalogue will contain not only stars from the halo , but also stars associated to the different components of the galaxy .",
    "these stars act as a _ smooth _ galactic background which could in principle complicate the task of identification of debris associated to accretion events .",
    "to take into account this stellar background , ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter bva05 ) created a monte carlo model of the milky way .",
    "this model consists of three different components : a disc , a bulge , and a smooth stellar halo ; where the latter was meant to take into account the set of halo stars formed in - situ . in this work",
    "we only consider the background contamination by the disc and bulge components of the monte carlo galactic model of bva05 , since we build our stellar halo completely from disrupted satellites .",
    "the disc model consists of particles distributed in space according to a double exponential profile . for the bulge model",
    "a plummer density distribution @xcite is adopted .",
    "to each particle an absolute magnitude and spectral class is assigned according to the hess diagram listed in table  4 - 7 of @xcite .",
    "finally , the kinematics are modelled assuming different velocity ellipsoids for stars in the disc of each spectral type whereas an isotropic velocity dispersion is assumed for bulge stars . for more details ,",
    "see section  2.1 of bva05 .",
    "space after 10  gyr of evolution .",
    "different colours represent different satellites.,width=321 ]    to convolve the positions and velocities of our mock catalogue of stars with the expected _ gaia _ errors we have followed the steps described in section  4.1 of bva05 .",
    "here we give a short overview of the procedure but we refer the reader to bva05 for more details . as a first step , we transform galactocentric positions and velocities to heliocentric coordinates , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . subsequently , these quantities are transformed into radial velocity and five astrometric observables that _ gaia _ will measure , i.e. , the galactic coordinates @xmath79 , the parallax @xmath80 , and the proper motions @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the next step consists in convolving with the expected _ gaia _ errors according to the accuracy assessment described in the _ gaia _ web pages at esa ( http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia ) .",
    "note that the errors vary most strongly with apparent magnitude , with a weaker dependence on colour and position on the sky .",
    "finally , we transformed the particles observed phase - space coordinates back to the galactocentric reference frame for our analysis .",
    "in this section we analyse how the debris of our 42 satellites is distributed in various projections of phase - space , before taking into account how the _ gaia _ observations will affect this distribution . in comparison to previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recall that our satellites have evolved in a live potential for 10  gyr .",
    "figure  [ fig : elz ] shows the distribution of @xmath83 randomly chosen particles from each satellite in the space of energy , @xmath52 , and the @xmath84-component of the angular momentum , @xmath85 .",
    "the different colours represent different satellites .",
    "note that in this projection of phase - space a large amount of substructure is still present , despite the strong evolution of the host gravitational potential ( e.g. the total mass increased by a factor @xmath86 ) .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we focus now on the stellar particles from our mock _ gaia _ catalogue ( prior to error convolution ) located within a ` solar neighbourhood ' sphere of 2.5  kpc radius , centred at 8  kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "figures  [ fig : mapas ] and [ fig : vel ] show their distribution on the sky and in velocity space , respectively . inside this sphere",
    "we find approximately @xmath87 stellar particles coming from 22 different satellites that contribute with , at least , 20 stars brighter than @xmath73 .",
    "the distribution on the sky is very smooth and , thus , disentangling merger debris in the ` solar neighbourhood ' by only using spatial information is not obvious . on the contrary",
    ", substructure can be observed in velocity space but this is clearly less sharply defined than what is found in the pseudo integrals of motion @xmath52@xmath88 space ( e.g. figure  [ fig : elz ] ) .",
    "we turn next to the space of orbital frequencies where we also expect to find much clumpiness .",
    "the orbital frequencies of the stellar particles are computed as follows ( see also section  5.1 of gh10 ) :    * we assume a fixed underlying potential : as described in section  [ pots ] at @xmath89 .",
    "* we integrate the orbits of each stellar particle for approximately 100 orbital periods . *",
    "we obtain their orbital frequencies by applying the spectral analysis code developed by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the stellar particles in frequency space is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : omegas_n_error ] .",
    "we use the same colour coding as in previous figures . note",
    "that satellite galaxies do not appear as a single and smooth structure , but rather as a collection of well defined and small clumps .",
    "these small clumps are associated to the different stellar streams crossing our solar neighbourhood sphere at present time . in a time",
    "independent gravitational potential , streams are distributed in frequency space along lines of constant @xmath90 and @xmath91 . however , in a time dependent potential , such as the one considered here , streams are distributed along lines with a given curvature , depending upon the rate of growth of the potential ( see also gh10 ) .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : omegas_n_error ] also shows that in the @xmath91 vs. @xmath92 space satellites may strongly overlap .",
    "this situation can be considerably improved by adding the @xmath84-component of the angular momentum as an extra dimension to this space , as shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : omegas_n_error ] .",
    "the distribution of debris in the space of @xmath93 vs. @xmath88 is very comparable to that in @xmath52 vs. @xmath88 , as a coarse comparison between figure  [ fig : elz ] and figure  [ fig : omegas_n_error ] will reveal . note as well that as in @xmath94 space , from this projection it is possible , solely by eye inspection , to isolate a few accreted satellites .    from this figure",
    "we can also notice that satellites on low frequency orbits have a smaller amount and a set of better defined streams than those on orbits with high frequency .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "firstly , satellites on low frequency orbits spend most of their time far from the centre of the host potential and therefore have longer mixing time - scales , as opposed to those on high frequency orbits ( short periods ) .",
    "secondly , potentials as the one considered in this work may admit a certain degree of chaoticity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "satellites on highly eccentric short period orbits come close to the galactic centre and may be ` scattered ' via chaos .",
    "such chaotic orbits do not have stable fundamental frequencies ( since they have fewer integrals of motion than needed and thus wander through phase - space ) .",
    "therefore , their structure in frequency space is rapidly erased .",
    "it is important to note that our desire to analyse a ` solar neighbourhood ' sphere has resulted in certain limitations .",
    "for example , some satellites do not contribute at all to this volume because of their particular orbit .",
    "in addition , most of the faint satellite galaxies have only a few , if any , ` stars ' with absolute magnitude above the limiting magnitude of our mock _ gaia _ catalogue and therefore they are not ` observable ' , either .",
    "an important feature of frequency space is that an estimate of the time since accretion of a satellite can be derived by measuring the separation between adjacent streams along the @xmath91 or @xmath90 directions ( * ? ? ?",
    "this characteristic scale may be estimated through a fourier analysis technique as follows    * we create an image of the scatter plot in frequency space , by griding the space with a regular @xmath95 mesh of bin size @xmath96 and count the number of stellar particles on each bin . * we apply a 2-d discrete fourier transform to this image and obtain @xmath97 * we compute a one - dimensional power spectrum along a thin slit centred on the wavenumbers @xmath98 as @xmath99\\\\ \\\\ $ for $ k_{\\phi}=1,\\dots,\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right),\\\\",
    "\\\\ \\displaystyle p(n/2)=\\frac{1}{n^2 } \\left|h(-n/2,0)\\right|^2 \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] and analogously for @xmath100 .",
    "* we identify the wavenumber @xmath101 of the dominant peak in the spectra , which corresponds to a wavelength equal to the distance between adjacent streams in frequency space . *   the estimate of the time since accretion is @xmath102 ( for more details , see section  3.2.3 of gh10 ) .",
    "we have applied this method to three different satellites from our simulations .",
    "two of these satellites ( labelled number 1 and 2 in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : omegas_n_error ] ) have a low frequency guiding orbit and , just by eye inspection , can be isolated in @xmath88 vs. @xmath103 space .",
    "the third one ( number 3 ) has a high frequency guiding orbit and overlaps with some other satellites in this space .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sats_frq ] we zoom - into the distribution of particles in frequency space for each satellite separately . from this figure",
    "we clearly appreciate the large number of streams that each of these satellites is contributing to this ` solar neighbourhood ' volume .",
    "although the number of streams apparent in this figure is very large ( 44 , 30 and 59 , for satellite 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively ) , this is consistent with the models of @xcite , who predicted a total of @xmath104 streams locally , i.e. in an infinitesimal volume around the sun .",
    "this is encouraging particularly because the models presented here are much more realistic than those by @xcite .    to obtain an estimate of the time since accretion for our satellites we compute the normalized power spectrum along the @xmath105 direction .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : sats_frq ] . from left to right , the peak with the highest amplitude in the spectrum is located at a wavenumber of @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108  gyr , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to an estimated time since accretion of @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111  gyr , respectively .",
    "these are in reasonable agreement with the true value , which we define as the time when @xmath112 of the stellar particles became unbound . for each satellite",
    "we obtain a @xmath113 of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116  gyr , respectively . in congruence with gh10",
    ", we find that this method provides a lower limit to the actual time since accretion , differing by @xmath117 .",
    "this is very encouraging since gh10 did not study such a complex growth of the host potential .",
    "we will now analyse the phase - space distribution of stellar particles located in a volume in the ` solar neighbourhood ' , as may be observed in the future by _ gaia_. we study how the _ gaia _ errors , as well as the contamination from other galactic components , would affect our ability to identify and characterize merger debris .      as in section",
    "[ sec : sn_no_err ] , we restrict our analysis to the stellar particles located inside a sphere of @xmath118  kpc radius centred at @xmath14  kpc from the galactic centre . to account for the maximum possible degree of background contamination , we consider all the stars for which _ gaia _ will measure full phase - space coordinates ( i.e. , all stars brighter than @xmath3 ) , according to the monte carlo model of the disc and bulge .",
    "disc particles largely outnumber those in the stellar halo , generally providing a prominent background .",
    "however much of this can be removed by considering the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of the galactic components . while the mdf of the halo peaks at approximately @xmath119 = -1.6 $ ] , that of disc peaks at @xmath119 \\approx -0.2 $ ] . as a consequence ,",
    "stars from the disc are in general more metal - rich and therefore a simple cut on metallicity could be of great help to isolate halo stars in our sample .",
    "it is therefore important to characterize well the metal poor tail of the galactic disc mdf .",
    "we use the model by @xcite to represent this tail : @xmath120,\\ ] ] and @xmath121 here @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath125 to vary as a function of the height from the plane of the disc , but for simplicity we fix @xmath126 .",

    "having derived a mdf for our disc model , we can proceed to apply a cut on metallicities @xmath119   \\geq -1.1 $ ] to the disc particles present in our ` solar neighbourhood ' sphere of 2.5  kpc radius .",
    "although in our simulation halo stars have metallicities between @xmath131 \\leq   -1.5 $ ] , stars with higher metallicities are known to be present in the galactic stellar halo .",
    "hence the more generous cut .",
    "this cut leads to a subsample of only @xmath132 ` disc stars ' brighter than @xmath3 out of a total of @xmath133 found in our model .",
    "a similar approach can be followed for the bulge component . in this case",
    "metallicities are assigned according to the observed mdf of the galactic bulge , as given by @xcite .",
    "this mdf is modelled as a single gaussian distribution with a mean metallicity @xmath134\\rangle = -0.28 $ ] dex and a dispersion @xmath135 dex , as found in the outermost field analysed by @xcite ( located at a latitude of @xmath136 ) .    after removing all stellar particles with @xmath137 \\geq   -1.1 $ ] , out of the @xmath138 bulge stellar particles with @xmath139",
    "originally present in our ` solar neighbourhood ' sphere we are left with only 784 stars .",
    "this very small number suggests that the contamination from this galactic component should not strongly affect the detection of substructure in phase - space .",
    "figure  [ fig : w_err ] shows the distribution of stellar particles inside the ` solar neighbourhood ' sphere in both frequency ( left - hand panel ) and @xmath88 vs. @xmath140 ( right - hand panel ) space , now after error convolution .",
    "again , the different colours indicate stellar particles from different satellites , with the addition of the disc and bulge which are shown in black .",
    "interestingly , in both spaces disc particles are part of a very well defined and quite isolated structure since , as expected for stars moving in the galactic plane on a circular orbit , they have the largest values of @xmath141 at a given @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to isolate and easily eliminate the contamination from the disc . on the other hand ,",
    "bulge particles are sparsely distributed in both spaces and , although there are very few , they can not be simply isolated as in the case of the disc .",
    "nonetheless , they do not define a clump that could be confused with merger debris .",
    "both panels of figure  [ fig : w_err ] show that , even after convolution with the latest model of the _ gaia _ measurement errors , significant substructure is apparent in @xmath88 vs. @xmath140 vs. @xmath91 space .",
    "comparison to figure  [ fig : omegas_n_error ] shows very good correspondence between clumps , although these are , as a consequence of the convolution , generally less well defined and contain less internal substructure .",
    "+       a derivation of the time since accretion is significantly more difficult when the _ gaia _ measurement errors are taken into account .",
    "we exemplify this by focusing on the three satellites described in section  [ sec : time_acc ] .",
    "the ` observed ' distribution of stellar particles in frequency space are shown in grey in the top panels of figure  [ fig : sats_frq_err ] .",
    "a direct comparison to figure  [ fig : sats_frq ] clearly highlights what the effects of the _ gaia _ errors are . as in section",
    "[ sec : time_acc ] , we perform our fourier analysis and compute the normalized power spectra .",
    "these are shown with a black solid line in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : sats_frq_err ] . only for the spectrum shown in the middle panel ,",
    "we can identify a single dominant peak .",
    "therefore observational errors seem to be large enough to erase the signal associated to the time since accretion in the power spectrum for at least some of our satellite galaxies .",
    "we wish to obtain an order of magnitude estimate of how large the errors in velocities have to be to blend two adjacent streams in frequency space .",
    "let us consider a satellite moving on a circular orbit accreted @xmath143  gyr ago .",
    "the separation of two adjacent streams in frequency space is @xmath144 ( comparable to that found for the satellites in our simulations ) . since @xmath145",
    ", we may deduce that the maximum error in the tangential velocity should be @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , for the streams found at @xmath147  kpc from the galactic centre , @xmath148 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this implies that , to be able to estimate the time since accretion from the power spectra , the relative parallax errors should be @xmath149 .",
    "the set of stellar particles from each of our three satellites satisfying this condition are shown as red dots in the top panel of figure  [ fig : sats_frq_err ] . out of the 445 (",
    "left panel ) , 1264 ( middle panel ) and 720 ( right panel ) stellar particles originally found inside our solar neighbourhood sphere , only 90 , 239 and 113 respectively , have remained after the error cut .",
    "the normalized power spectra obtained for these distributions are shown with dashed black lines in bottom panels of figure  [ fig : sats_frq_err ] .",
    "now , the largest amplitude peak is ( once again and for all satellites ) associated to the time since accretion .",
    "note that , since each peak is located at the same wavenumber as in the analysis with no observational errors ( grey curves in this figure ) , the estimated times since accretion for each satellite are exactly those obtained in section  [ sec : time_acc ] .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the signal found in the power spectra could be determined better if a larger number of stars with @xmath150 could be available .",
    "such stars are expected to be present in the _ gaia _ catalogue , but because of the limited numerical resolution of our experiments , they are not part of our mock _ gaia _ catalogue .",
    "such stars would be fainter than @xmath151 , but closer than 2  kpc from the sun .",
    "for example , according to the latest _",
    "performance numbers , a dwarf star located at 1  kpc from the sun , with an apparent magnitude of v @xmath152 16 should have a parallax measurement error @xmath153 .",
    "this apparent magnitude and distance translates into an absolute magnitude of @xmath154 , i.e. it is 1.5 magnitudes fainter than limiting magnitude we have used in our simulations .",
    "if we use the number of particles found at distances closer than 1  kpc from the sun , and if we take into account the luminosity functions of the 3 satellites in fig .",
    "10 , we can obtain an estimate of how many stars would be observable by _ gaia _ with the desired parallax errors . in this way we find ,",
    "respectively , 186 , 465 , and 276 extra stars with @xmath155 , which will thus allows to estimate the time since accretion for each satellite .",
    "although promising , this is unlikely to be the way we will proceed in the future with real _ gaia _ observations . in order to obtain an estimate of the time since accretion of any given satellite , we first have to efficiently identify it .",
    "this can be performed by applying a suitable clustering technique . in this work",
    "we have used the mean shift algorithm @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind mean shift is to treat the points in any @xmath0-dimensional space as an empirical probability density function where dense regions in the space correspond to the local maxima of the underlying distribution . for each data point in the space , one performs a gradient ascent procedure on the local estimated density until convergence is reached .",
    "furthermore , the data points associated with the same stationary point are considered members of the same cluster .",
    "we have applied the mean shift algorithm to the set of particles inside a sphere of 4  kpc radius , located at 8  kpc from the galactic centre , projected into the space of @xmath156 .",
    "we chose this space because the satellite s internal substructure ( due to the presence of individual streams ) is less well defined and , therefore , is more suitable for a clustering search of global structures . enclosed in this sphere we find a total of @xmath157 stellar particles , coming from 26 different satellites contributing each with at least 20 particles .",
    "in addition , the disc and the bulge contribute with @xmath158 and @xmath159 particles , respectively . for this analysis we especially chose to sample a larger volume of physical space so that each satellite is represented with a larger number of stellar particles . in this way",
    ", we can avoid overfragmentation , which occurs when a clump is populated with a very small number of particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : mstest ] shows the different clusters of particles identified with this method .",
    "we have found 17 groups that contain more than 20 particles . out",
    "these 17 groups , only 15 have more than @xmath160 of its particles associated to a single progenitor .",
    "one of these groups corresponds to the disc while two other are double detections of two different satellites that were fragmented by the algorithm .",
    "therefore , only 12 of these groups can be uniquely associated to a single satellite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath161 of all the satellites contributing with stars to this volume .",
    "this is a similar recovery rate to that obtained by @xcite , but now under a more realistic cosmological model and with the latest model for the _ gaia _ measurement errors .",
    "when attempting to compute the time since accretion , we were successful only in four cases .",
    "these groups are indicated in figure  [ fig : mstest ] with black open circles .",
    "two of them correspond to the satellites labeled number 1 and 2 in previous analysis . in general , we find that the remaining identified groups lack a significant number of ` stars ' with the required relative parallax error , @xmath162 ( i.e. , typically @xmath163 ) . however , as explained before , in this simulation our limited numerical resolution led us to consider only stars with @xmath164 .",
    "after estimating the number of stellar particles within 1  kpc from the sun that may be observed by _ gaia _ with the required relative parallax errors ( as explained in section  [ sec : est_time_acc_err ] ) , we find that at least two additional satellites , among the 12 previously isolated , should have at least 200 stellar particles available to compute a reliable power spectrum .",
    "vs. @xmath88 space as would be observed by _",
    "gaia_. the different colours show the groups identified by the mean shift algorithm .",
    "black open circles denote those for which the time since accretion was successfully derived.,width=313 ]    we have studied the characteristics of merger debris in the solar neighbourhood as may be observed by esa s _ gaia _ mission in the near future .",
    "we have run a suite of @xmath0-body simulations of the formation of the milky way stellar halo set up to match , at the present time , its known properties such as the velocity ellipsoid , density profile and total luminosity .",
    "the simulations follow the accretion of a set of 42 satellite galaxies onto a semi - cosmological time dependent galactic potential . these satellites are evolved for 10  gyr , and we use the final positions and velocities of the constituent particles to generate a mock _ gaia _ catalogue .    using synthetic cmds , we have resampled the satellite s particles to represent stars down to @xmath165 .",
    "this absolute magnitude corresponds to an apparent magnitude @xmath166 at 2.5  kpc , which is comparable to the _ gaia _ magnitude limit for which full phase - space information will be available .",
    "our mock catalogue also includes a galactic background population of stars represented by a monte carlo model of the galactic disc and bulge , as in @xcite . at 8  kpc from the galactic centre ,",
    "stars from the disc largely outnumber those of the stellar halo , however it is possible to reduce their impact by applying a simple cut on metallicity .",
    "we have estimated , using the latest determinations of the mdf of the galactic disc(s ) @xcite , that only @xmath167 stars out of the estimated @xmath168 disc stars brighter than @xmath3 in the solar neighbourhood should have [ @xmath169 \\leq -1.1 $ ] . a smaller number of bulge stars ( @xmath170 ) with [ @xmath171   \\leq -1.1 $ ] is expected to contaminate our stellar halo sample , down to the faintest @xmath172 . this fraction represents only @xmath173 per cent of the whole mock _",
    "gaia _ stellar halo catalogue , and therefore does not constitute an important obstacle to our ability to characterize this component .    finally , we have convolved the positions and velocities of all ` observable stars ' in our solar neighbourhood sphere with the latest models of the _ gaia _ observational errors , according to performances given by esa ( http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia ) .",
    "the analysis presented here confirms previous results , namely that satellites can be identified as coherent clumps in phase - space , e.g. in the @xmath52-@xmath85 projection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that a clustering algorithm such as mean - shift @xcite is able to recover roughly 50% of all satellites contributing stellar particles to the solar neighbourhood sphere .",
    "we have also demonstrated that even after accounting for the galactic background contamination and the expected measurement errors for the _ gaia _ mission , the space of orbital frequencies is also very rich in substructure . in this",
    "space streams from a given satellite define a regular pattern whose characteristic scale is determined by the satellite s time since accretion .",
    "we find that reasonable estimates of the time since accretion may be provided when the number of stars with accurate parallaxes ( @xmath149 ) from a given satellite is at least @xmath174 .",
    "this was possible in our simulations for 4 cases .    together with _",
    "gaia _ , ground",
    "based follow - up campaigns are currently being planned by european astronomical community .",
    "their purpose is to complement a future _ gaia _ catalogue with information that either will not be obtained or for which the accuracy will be very low . as an example , high resolution multi object spectroscopy in combination with ground based photometry could not only push the limiting magnitude of the phase - space catalogue down to @xmath175 , but could also provide detailed chemical abundance patterns of individual stars .",
    "the former will require the development of accurate and precise photometric distances indicators which can be calibrated using the large number of stars near the sun with very precise trigonometric parallaxes from _ gaia_. the identification of satellites in , e.g. , @xmath94 space could be considerably improved by having such an extended full phase - space catalogue .",
    "firstly , very faint satellites could now be observed and , secondly , the much larger sample of stars could allow us to apply a clustering algorithm in very small volumes around the sun with enough resolution to avoid large overfragmentation .",
    "the later is important because by extending the volume probed we expect to reduce the overlap between satellites in @xmath94 space .",
    "in addition , chemical tagging will be very important to characterize the satellite s star formation and chemical histories @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in our simulations we find that stellar particles in a given stream do not originate from a localized region in physical space ( such as a single molecular cloud ) .",
    "therefore even individual streams are likely to reflect the full mdf present in the object at the time it was accreted .",
    "although our satellites were evolved in a cosmologically motivated time dependent host potential , our simulations do not contain the fully hierarchical and often chaotic build - up of structure characteristic of the @xmath1 cold dark matter model .",
    "the violent variation of the host potential during merger events , the chaotic behavior induced by a triaxial dark matter halo ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and the orbital evolution due to baryonic condensation @xcite , are potentially important effects which we have neglected and should be taken into account in future work . to assess the impact of some of these effects on the distribution of debris in the solar neighbourhood we are currently analysing a fully cosmological high resolution simulation of the formation of the galactic stellar halo based on the aquarius project @xcite .",
