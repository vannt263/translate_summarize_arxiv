    "despite many efforts the bound state problem of qcd is still far from being well understood .",
    "one of the main tasks is to investigate the relevance of quarks as dynamical degrees of freedom in hadronic bound states .",
    "since a relativistic treatment for the quarks in deeply bound states is essential , the bethe - salpeter(bs)-equation @xcite provides a suitable starting point .",
    "unlike in qed one can not use perturbation theory to obtain useful approximations for the interaction kernel in qcd .",
    "therefore our knowledge of the interaction between quarks is still quite fragmentary and various phenomenological alternatives have to be tested . in the present work we will restrict ourselves to @xmath0-states .",
    "the use of general @xmath0-interaction kernels depending on the relative time variable leads to serious conceptional and practical problems @xcite .",
    "therefore it is very useful at this point to make the simplifying assumption that the bs - kernel can be approximated by an effective interaction that is instantaneous in the rest frame of the bound state .",
    "the bs - equation then reduces to the ( full ) salpeter equation @xcite that has been investigated for @xmath0-states e.g. by llewellyn smith @xcite , le yaouanc and coworkers @xcite and recently by laga @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the properties of the salpeter equation for the general case of unequal quark masses in sec.[ii ] . in sec.[iii ] we present a flexible numerical treatment of this equation based on the variational principle of ref.@xcite .",
    "we use the block structure of the salpeter amplitude to derive an expansion in terms of a complete set of basis functions which leads to a matrix equation analogous to the rpa ( random phase approximation ) equation well known in nuclear theory @xcite .",
    "our numerical method can be applied to a wide class of phenomenological interaction kernels . in sec.[iv ] we show how to reconstruct the full bs - amplitudes from the salpeter amplitudes and present the calculation of some decay observables within the mandelstam formalism including the decay @xmath1 . concluding remarks given are in sec.[v ] .    the method obtained in this paper",
    "will be applied to an explicit quark model for light mesons in a subsequent paper @xcite .",

    "one has to justify this ansatz a posteriori by investigating its consequences in the framework of explicit models .",
    "furthermore we will approximate the full quark propagators @xmath23 by bare propagators @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are interpreted as effective masses for the quark and the antiquark .",
    "this approximation has been criticized @xcite because free propagators might be incompatible with a confining kernel . on",
    "the other hand one can argue that this choice naturally leads to nonrelativistic potential models that have been applied successfully to heavy quarkonia ( a recent model calculation is presented in @xcite , for an extensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "we thus feel that free propagators should be a reasonable effective parameterization at least for heavy quarks .",
    "it is still an open question whether free propagators can also be applied to light quarks , and one has to investigate this problem within explicit models .    with an instantaneous bs - kernel and bare propagators with effective quark masses one can perform the @xmath27 integrals in the bs - equation in the rest frame of the bound state with mass @xmath28 ( see e.g. @xcite ) and",

    ", however , the use of the reduced salpeter equation is dubious , especially for deeply bound states like the pion .",
    "quark models for light quarks should therefore be based on the full salpeter equation eq.([9 ] ) .",

    "this formula allows the reconstruction of the vertex function @xmath70 and therefore of the full bs - amplitude @xmath2 from the salpeter amplitude @xmath33 . inserting eq.([dv ] ) into the normalization condition ( [ nrm ] ) the dependence on @xmath27 is completely determined by the quark - propagators , so that the @xmath27-integration may be performed analytically .",
    "we use the general relation between the bs - amplitude @xmath2 and it s adjoint @xmath71 for spin-1/2-fermions ( see e.g. @xcite for the scalar case ) : @xmath72 with matrix valued functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from this",

    "this doubling can be traced back to the appearance of the time ordering operator @xmath6 in the definition of the particle - hole propagator . therefore neglecting negative mass eigenvalues",

    "since @xmath48 is bilinear we nevertheless can expand @xmath94 as @xmath176 so that the constraint @xmath177 is automatically fulfilled .",

    "only a finite basis @xmath196 can be taken into account .",
    "then eq.([87 ] ) becomes a finite matrix equation that can be solved with standard numerical methods .",
    "one thus obtains an approximate eigenvalue @xmath197 and an approximate eigen function @xmath198 to the salpeter equation that exactly fulfill the relation @xmath199 the index @xmath200 indicates that the basis states @xmath201 and thus @xmath198 depend on a variational parameter @xmath200 of dimension @xmath202 that sets the absolute scale for the momentum dependence via @xmath203 .",

    "the important question arises whether a good description of the extremely deep bound states as pion or kaon can be combined with a reasonable description of confinement .",
    "the bs formalism offers a natural framework , as the role of the lower component of the wave function turns out to be crucial for the correct normalization and calculation of the decays .",
    "this can be seen most clearly in the following formulas for the leptonic decays and the weak decay constants .",
    "we furthermore show how to reconstruct the full bs amplitude , which may be used as a starting point for the calculation of electromagnetic or hadronic transitions .",
    "the transition or decay of bound states are calculated from bs amplitudes using the formalism given by mandelstam @xcite .",

    "the corresponding feynman diagram is given by fig.[mandel ] where @xmath216 denotes the kernel which is irreducible with respect to the incoming @xmath0-pair and the outgoing @xmath217-pair .",
    "if we consider only graphs of leading order in the electromagnetic coupling constant we obtain the approximation on the right hand side .",
    "the exceptional role of these decays ( together with the weak decay constants ) is that if the bs kernel would be exact also the decay amplitudes would be correct to any order in the strong interaction .",
