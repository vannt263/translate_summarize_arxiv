    "the analysis of the redshift - distance relation of snia revealed that our universe is currently accelerating @xcite which has been confirmed by the current high quality observations of the cmb @xcite , the large scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies @xcite , and the snia @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that this acceleration is attributed to a new form of energy , dubbed _ dark energy _ , which recently dominate the energy density of the universe with negative pressure and almost not clustering .",
    "the nature of de is among the biggest problems in modern physics and has been studied extensively .",
    "a cosmological constant , the simplest de candidate whose equation of state @xmath1 remains @xmath2 , suffers from the well - known fine - tuning and coincidence problems . alternatively , dynamical dark energy models with rolling scalar fields have been proposed , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite and k - essence @xcite .",
    "given our ignorance of the nature of dark energy , the cosmological observations play a crucial role in our understanding of de .",
    "there are many studies on de both theoretically and phenomenologically in the literature @xcite .",
    "if we regard the mysterious de as a cosmic fluid , there will be perturbations when @xmath3 . in the framework of the linear perturbations theory ,",
    "the de perturbations can be fully characterized by its equation of state , @xmath4 , and its sound speed , @xmath5 . for the de perturbations",
    "it is well - defined in the region of quintessence , @xmath6 , and phantom , @xmath7 . in our previous works @xcite based on quintom dark energy model",
    ", we have proposed a new method to handle the de perturbations in the region closed to @xmath8 , assuming the sound speed of dark energy is equal to unity , @xmath9 .",
    "we found that the constraints on the de parameters are relaxed and the parameter space are enlarged dramatically when the de perturbations are included in the analysis .",
    "the effects of perturbations on studying the feature of de are of great significance .",
    "since the sound speed of de merely affects the evolution of perturbation , it has not been investigated extensively in the literature .",
    "recently the observational implications of the sound speed on cmb and lss of some de models have been discussed : for example , for k - essence @xcite , condensation of dark matter @xcite and the chaplygin gas @xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "the authors tried to use the current observational data to constrain the sound speed of de .",
    "however , they just considered the equation of state of de to be constant . in this paper",
    "we consider the dynamical de model with time varying @xmath1 and extend our previous works on the sound speed of de models and allow an arbitrary constant sound speed in our calculation .",
    "combining the present observational data , such as cmb , lss and snia , we discuss the possible constraints on the sound speed of de .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we analyze the feature of the sound speed of dark energy models paying attention to the case when the equation of state gets across @xmath8 ; in section iii we describe the method and the datasets we used ; in section iv we present our results derived from a global analysis using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method ; finally , section v contains a discussion of the results .",
    "working in the conformal newtonian gauge , one can easily describe the de perturbations as follows @xcite : @xmath10 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to conformal time , @xmath11 denotes the sound speed of de models , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the density and velocity perturbations of de models respectively , @xmath4 is the equation of state , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the metric perturbations .",
    "let us discuss the behavior of the perturbations of single perfect fluid when @xmath1 crosses the boundary @xmath8 in the conformal newtonian gauge , following @xcite .",
    "firstly , we consider the de as a single barotropic fluid . the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath16 , is purely determined by the equation of state @xmath1 , @xmath17 whenever the equation of state closes to the boundary @xmath8 and @xmath18",
    ", the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath16 , will be divergent due to the existence of the term @xmath19 .",
    "apparently , the perturbations of this system become unstable .    however , in non - barotropic fluids , for example in most scalar field models , this simple relation in eq.([adisoseq ] ) between the equation of state and the sound speed breaks down , because of the intrinsic entropy perturbations , and we have the more general relation @xmath20 in this case , if @xmath21 , the intrinsic entropy perturbation @xmath22 will be induced @xcite : @xmath23 whereas the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath16 , and @xmath22 are scale independent and gauge invariant quantities , while @xmath24 can be neither . in order to construct the gauge invariant @xmath24",
    "we use a helpful transformation @xcite : @xmath25 this transformation relates the gauge invariant , rest frame density perturbation , @xmath26 , to the density and velocity perturbations in a general frame , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . using eqs.([gammaeq],[deltaeq ] )",
    ", we can rewrite the pressure perturbation in a general frame , @xmath27 , in terms of the rest frame sound speed , @xmath28 , @xmath29 for example single scalar field models with standard kinetic terms always have @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the eqs.([dotdelta],[dottheta ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath31 in this case if we require the de equation of state can cross the boundary @xmath8 , the de perturbations are still divergent ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "as discussed above , the de models , whose equation of state can cross the boundary @xmath8 , need more degrees of freedom to keep the whole system stable @xcite . as an example , we consider one type of quintom de models with two components , one is quintessence - like , @xmath32 , and the other is phantom - like , @xmath33 @xcite and analyze the perturbations of this de system .",
    "the most notable advantage , in this case , is that it is unnecessary to let the total equation of state , @xmath34 , of this quintom system cross the boundary @xmath8 by forcing the equation of state of each component to cross the boundary . for the quintessence - like component , @xmath32 , while for the phantom - like component , @xmath33 , during the evolution , without any crossing behavior . for each component of the quintom model",
    "the density and velocity perturbations , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , still satisfy the eqs.([dotdelta2],[dottheta2 ] ) . because the equation of state for each component needs not cross the boundary , the perturbations of each component will be stable and all the variables will be well defined .",
    "furthermore , all these corresponding variables of the whole quintom de model can be combined with each component : @xmath37 using these eqs.([rhoeff]@xmath38[deltapeff ] ) , these variables of quintom de models are well defined except the velocity perturbations @xmath39 .",
    "as long as @xmath34 gets across the boundary , @xmath40 , the denominator of eqs.([thetaeff ] ) goes to zero , @xmath41\\rightarrow0 $ ] .",
    "consequently , the total velocity perturbations , @xmath39 , become divergent unless these two independent perturbations are equal all the time , @xmath42 . during the evolution ,",
    "it is impossible to keep the velocity perturbations of each component equal , @xmath43 , all the time .",
    "however , the physically meaningful velocity perturbation which is relevant to the cmb observations is @xmath44 , not @xmath13 alone @xcite .",
    "eq.([thetaeff ] ) can now be written as : @xmath45 using this eq.([veff ] ) , the divergences disappear when the total equation of state crosses the boundary @xmath8 . and then all the variables are well defined and the perturbations of quintom dark energy system are stable in the whole parameter space of the total equation of state , adding more degrees of freedom .",
    "let us move to the discussion of the sound speed of the whole quintom dark energy system .",
    "physically we can use the independent sound speed of each component to describe the whole system . however , the present constraints on the sound speed of de are so weak that considering to study the two independent sound speed is not justified at present . for simplicity",
    "we investigate the effective sound speed , @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath47 it is apparent that this effective sound speed suffers from the same problem with the velocity perturbations @xmath39 . in order to settle this divergence of the effective sound speed we fix the sound speed of each component to be equal , @xmath48 .",
    "the effective sound speed of the whole quintom system should be a constant during the evolution : @xmath49 the total equation of state of quintom system has nothing to do with the effective sound speed now .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite we considered the quintom dark energy model with the effective sound speed @xmath50 . in this paper",
    "we relax this limitation and assume an effective arbitrary constant sound speed of quintom de model , @xmath51 .",
    "the effects of this effective sound speed on cmb power spectrum will be studied in the next subsection .      in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we illustrate how the cmb temperature anisotropies of four different de models charactrized by different equations of state @xmath1 change on large scales , for different constant sound speed @xmath28 .",
    "recently we know that our universe is dominated by the dark energy component .",
    "this means the sound speed of de can only affect the cmb power spectrum at the very large observable scale via the late integrated - sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect which describes the perturbations induced by the passage of cmb photons through the time evolving gravitational potential wells during de domination @xcite .",
    "the explicit effect on cmb power spectra caused by the sound speed of de appears at the large angular scale @xmath52 .",
    "however , as the behavior of the equation of state is close to the cosmological constant boundary @xmath8 , these differences get smaller and even disappear .",
    "the different effects of the two de models in the bottom panels are much clearer than the ones in the top panels which are closer to the boundary .    , for different constant dark energy sound speed @xmath28 .",
    "on the left two panels , the bottom black solid line is for the sound speed of @xmath53 and the top magenta dash dot dot line is with @xmath54 . in between",

    "however as pointed out in refs.@xcite , the existence of the operator @xmath175 makes it possible for @xmath1 to cross over the cosmological constant boundary . furthermore , at quantum level as an perturbation theory this effective model is well defined .",
    "the connection of this type of quintom - like theory to the string theory has been considered in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the sound speed - @xmath0 , which is directly related to the classical perturbations - of the dynamical dark energy ( de ) , especially with an equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary in details and show its implications on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy . with the present observational data of cmb , type ia supernova ( snia ) and galaxy clustering , we perform a global analysis to constrain the sound speed of dark energy , using the markov chain monte carlo method . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sound speed of dark energy is weakly constrained by current observations thus the futuristic precision measurements of cmb on a very large angular scale ( low multipoles ) are necessary . </S>"
