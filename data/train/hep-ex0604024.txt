    "exclusive @xmath19 decays proceed dominantly via a @xmath20 tree process and can be used to determine @xmath18 , one of the smallest and least known elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix  @xcite .",
    "however , the need to translate the observed rate to a @xmath18 value using model - dependent decay form - factors ( ff ) has resulted in large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the recent release of ff results for @xmath17 calculated by unquenched lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite makes possible the first model - independent determination of @xmath18 .",
    "since lqcd results are available only in the high @xmath12 region ( @xmath21gev@xmath16 ) , a clean measurement of the partial @xmath17 branching fraction in the same high @xmath12 region is needed",
    ".    there have been several measurements in the past by cleo , babar and belle for the @xmath17 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes  @xcite .",
    "the analyses in these measurements utilize the method , originally developed by cleo , where the @xmath6 decays are reconstructed by inferring the undetected neutrino mass from missing energy and momentum ( `` @xmath25-reconstruction method '' )  @xcite . in the @xmath6-factory era",
    ", we will improve the statistical precision by simply applying the @xmath25-reconstruction method using a large amount of data .",
    "however , the poor signal - to - noise ratio will limit the systematic uncertainty of the measurement .    in this paper we present measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath27 decays using @xmath28 decay tagging .",
    "we reconstruct the entire decay chain from the @xmath4 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 with several @xmath32 sub - modes .",
    "the back - to - back correlation of the two @xmath6 mesons in the @xmath4 rest frame allows us to constrain the kinematics of the double semileptonic decay .",
    "the signal is reconstructed in four modes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "yields and branching fractions are extracted from a simultaneous fit of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 samples in three intervals of @xmath12 , accounting for cross - feed between modes as well as other backgrounds .",
    "we have applied this method to @xmath35 decays for the first time , and have succeeded in reconstructing these decays with significantly improved signal - to - noise ratios compared to the @xmath25-reconstruction method .",
    "inclusion of charge conjugate decays is implied throughout this paper .",
    "the analysis is based on data recorded with the belle detector at the kekb collider operating at the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy for the @xmath4 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 dataset that is used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 253 fb@xmath36 and contains @xmath2 @xmath3 events .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a super - conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath37 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used . a 2.0 cm beam pipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector",
    "was used for the first sample of @xmath38 @xmath39 pairs , while a 1.5 cm beam pipe , a 4-layer silicon detector , and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 123 million @xmath39 pairs  @xcite .",
    "a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , which fully describes the detector geometry and response and is based on geant  @xcite , is applied to estimate the signal detection efficiency and to study the background . to examine the ff dependence , mc samples for the @xmath35 signal decays",
    "are generated with different form - factor models : a quark model ( isgw  ii  @xcite ) , light cone sum rules ( lcsr for @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath40  @xcite ) and quenched lattice qcd ( ukqcd  @xcite ) .",
    "we also use unquenched lattice qcd ( fnal  @xcite and hpqcd  @xcite ) for @xmath17 and a relativistic quark model ( melikhov  @xcite ) for @xmath40 . to model the cross - feed from other",

    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed from hits in the svd and the cdc .",
    "they are required to satisfy track quality cuts based on their impact parameters relative to the measured interaction point ( ip ) of the two beams .",
    "charged kaons are identified by combining information on ionization loss ( @xmath42 ) in the cdc , herenkov light yields in the acc and time - of - flight measured by the tof system . for the nominal requirement , the kaon identification efficiency is approximately @xmath43 and the rate for misidentification of pions as kaons is about @xmath44 .",
    "hadron tracks that are not identified as kaons are treated as pions .",
    "tracks satisfying the lepton identification criteria , as described below , are removed from consideration .",
    "neutral pions are reconstructed using @xmath45 pairs with an invariant mass between 117 and 150mev/@xmath46 .",

    "@xmath48 mesons are reconstructed using pairs of tracks that are consistent with having a common vertex and that have an invariant mass within @xmath49mev/@xmath46 of the known @xmath48 mass .",
    "electron identification is based on a combination of @xmath42 in the cdc , the response of the acc , shower shape in the ecl and the ratio of energy deposit in the ecl to the momentum measured by the tracking system .",
    "muons are identified by their signals in the klm resistive plate counters , which are interleaved with the iron of the solenoid return yoke .",
    "the lepton identification efficiencies are estimated to be about 90% for both electrons and muons in the momentum region above 1.2gev/@xmath50 , where leptons from prompt @xmath6 decays dominate .",
    "the hadron misidentification rate is measured using reconstructed @xmath51 and found to be less than 0.2% for electrons and 1.5% for muons in the same momentum region .    for the reconstruction of @xmath31 ,",
    "the lepton candidate is required to have the correct sign charge with respect to the @xmath52 meson flavor and a laboratory momentum ( @xmath53 ) greater than 1.0gev/@xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath52 meson candidates are reconstructed by using seven decay modes of @xmath54 : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ; and ten decay modes of @xmath62 : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the candidates are required to have an invariant mass @xmath73 within @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is a standard deviation ) of the nominal @xmath52 mass , where the mass resolution @xmath75 is dependent on the decay mode .",
    "@xmath76 mesons are reconstructed in the modes @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 by combining a @xmath52 meson candidate and a charged or neutral pion .",
    "each @xmath80 candidate is required to have a mass difference @xmath81 within @xmath82 of the nominal values .    for the reconstruction of @xmath83 , the lepton candidate is required to have the right sign charge with respect to the @xmath84 system and @xmath53 greater than 0.8 gev/@xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath84 system may consist of one pion or two pions ( @xmath85 or @xmath86 for a @xmath87 tag and @xmath88 or @xmath89 for a @xmath90 tag ) .",
    "the event is required to have no additional charged tracks or @xmath91 candidates .",
    "we also require that the residual energy from neutral clusters be less than 0.15 gev ( @xmath92gev ) .",
    "the two leptons on the tag and the signal sides are required to have opposite charge .",
    "the loss of signal due to @xmath93 mixing is estimated by mc simulation .",
    "we then impose a constraint based on the kinematics of the double semileptonic decay in the @xmath4 rest frame . in the semileptonic decay on each side , @xmath94",
    "( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , the angle between the @xmath97 meson and the detected @xmath98 system @xmath99 is calculated from the relation , @xmath100 ( @xmath101 : 4-momentum vector ) and the known @xmath102 ( the absolute momentum of the mother @xmath6 meson ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath97 direction is constrained on the surface of a cone defined with the angle @xmath103 around the direction of the @xmath98 system , as shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_cone ] .",
    "the back - to - back relation of the two @xmath6 meson directions then implies that the real @xmath6 direction is on the intersection of the two cones when one of the @xmath6 systems is spatially inverted .",
    "denoting @xmath104 the angle between the @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the @xmath6 directional vector @xmath107 is given by , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 with the coordinate definition in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_cone ] , where the @xmath105 and @xmath111 are aligned along the @xmath112-axis and in the @xmath113 plane , respectively .",
    "if the hypothesis of the double semileptonic decay is correct and all the decay products are detected except for the two neutrinos , @xmath114 must range from 0 to 1 .",
    "events passing a rather loose cut @xmath115 are used for signal extraction at a later stage of the analysis .",
    "since the direction of the @xmath6 meson is not uniquely determined , we calculate , @xmath12 as @xmath116 , using the beam energy ( @xmath117 ) , energy ( @xmath118 ) and momentum ( @xmath119 ) of the @xmath84 system and neglecting the momentum of the @xmath6 meson in the c.m . system .",
    "the signal monte carlo simulation finds that the @xmath12 resolution depends on the reconstructed @xmath12 and is in the range 0.32 - 0.95gev@xmath16 .",
    "according to monte carlo simulation , the largest backgrounds originate from @xmath120 and non - signal @xmath19 decays , where some particles escape detection .",
    "there are sizable contributions from cross talk between the @xmath87 and @xmath34 tags .",
    "the contribution from @xmath41 processes is found to be negligible .    for events selected",
    "as described above , the signal mc simulation indicates that the total detection efficiency ( @xmath121 ) , averaged over electron and muon channels , is @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 assuming the lcsr ff model . here , @xmath121 is defined with respect to the number of @xmath3 pairs , where one @xmath6 decays into the signal mode , and includes the loss of signal due to @xmath93 mixing .",
    "because of the loose lepton momentum cut  ( @xmath53 @xmath130gev/@xmath50 ) , the variation of efficiency with different ff models is relatively small .",
    "table  [ tbl : matrix_sig ] gives the matrix @xmath131 , the efficiency for a signal event generated with true @xmath12 in the bin @xmath132 to be reconstructed in the bin @xmath133 .",
    "table  [ tbl : summary_vub ] summarizes the results , where the first and second errors are the experimental statistical and systematic errors , respectively .",
    "the third error is based on the error on @xmath135 quoted by the lqcd authors .",
    "these theoretical errors are asymmetric because we assign them by taking the variation in @xmath18 when @xmath135 is varied by the quoted errors .",
    "the values are in agreement with those from inclusive @xmath136 decays  @xcite .    to summarize , we have measured the branching fractions of the decays @xmath137 and @xmath138 in @xmath139 @xmath140 events using a method which tags one @xmath6 in the mode @xmath141 .",
    "our results are consistent with previous measurements , and their precision is comparable to that of results from other experiments . the ratios of results for neutral and charged @xmath6 meson modes are found to be consistent with isospin .",
