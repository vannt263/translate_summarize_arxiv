    "investigation on sample covariance matrices has a long history .",
    "it was originally introduced in multivariate statistical analysis  @xcite .",
    "let us consider @xmath5 dimensional sample vectors @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of samples .",
    "the sample covariance matrix @xmath9 is then defined as @xmath10 where the sample mean vector @xmath11 is @xmath12    let us suppose that @xmath6 are random vectors : the components @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables .",
    "then the distribution of @xmath15 is the same as the distribution of the @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the transpose of @xmath1 ) , where the elements of the @xmath19 matrix @xmath1 are independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables .",
    "the ensemble of sample covariance matrices is sometimes called `` chiral gaussian '' or `` laguerre '' ensemble and finds applications in neural - network learning  @xcite , quantum chromodynamics  @xcite , mesoscopic physics  @xcite , finance  @xcite and wireless communication  @xcite .    in multivariate statistics",
    "one is usually interested in the limit @xmath20 with fixed @xmath5 . on the other hand , motivated by wigner s celebrated work  @xcite on real symmetric random matrices , marcenko and pastur studied another limit @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and derived the asymptotic density for the scaled eigenvalues of @xmath24 as  @xcite @xmath25 this asymptotic result is valid for more general distributions of the matrix @xmath1 , and is sometimes called marcenko - pastur law .",
    "one of the simplest ways to modify the random matrix @xmath24 so that marcenko - pastur law breaks down is to make the matrix @xmath1 sparse .",
    "an example demonstrating the significance of considering random matrix ensembles defined on the basis of sparse @xmath1 can be found in communication theory : information - theoretic channel capacity of a randomly - spread code - division multiple - access ( cdma ) channel is evaluated in terms of eigenvalue distribution of the matrix @xmath26 with @xmath1 defining the random spreading .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that some wideband cdma schemes can be modeled as a sparsely - spread system , where deviations from marcenko - pastur law may affect performance of such systems .",
    "sparse random matrices in general are also of interest in many branches of applications . in particular , the eigenvector localization expected to occur in sparse random matrices is one of the most outstanding phenomena in disordered systems .",
    "the appearance of isolated eigenvalue spectra in the tail region is another interesting feature .",
    "such features are also observed in heavy - tailed random matrices and were recently studied in detail  @xcite .    in this paper , as a continuation of a brief report by one of the authors  @xcite , we investigate the spectral ( eigenvalue ) density of sparse sample covariance matrices . in the case of real symmetric sparse random matrices @xmath27 whose",
    "elements @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are independently distributed , the asymptotic spectral density was already studied by several authors  @xcite .",
    "field theoretic ( replica and supersymmetry ) methods were usually employed .",
    "for example , semerjian and cugliandolo utilized a sophisticated version of replica method and discussed the spectral density in connection with the percolation problem  @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we present a similar replica method developed for the analysis of sparse sample covariance matrices . in  3 and  4 ,",
    "the effective medium approximation ( ema ) and its symmetrized version are introduced . in  5 , we consider the case of binary distribution and evaluate the asymptotic spectral density . in  6 , the tail behavior of the spectral density is analyzed by means of the single defect approximation ( sda ) , which improves the symmetrized version of ema .",
