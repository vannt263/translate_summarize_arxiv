    "recently several authors have calculated the dynamic structure factor @xmath22 in the luttinger liquid phase of model systems for interacting fermions with non - linear energy dispersion in one spatial dimension  @xcite .",

    "the dynamic structure factor can be directly measured via scattering experiments probing density - density correlations of the system .",
    "it is therefore important to have quantitatively accurate theoretical predictions for the line - shape of @xmath0 .",

    "the spectral line - shape is expected to depend on non - universal parameters of the model under consideration , such as the non - linear terms in the expansion of the energy dispersion @xmath26 around the fermi momentum @xmath5 , or the coefficients in the expansion of the fourier transform @xmath2 of the interaction for small momentum - transfers @xmath10 . because these parameters correspond to couplings which are irrelevant ( in the renormalization group sense ) at the luttinger liquid fixed point , the line - shape of @xmath0",

    "expanding the energy dispersion around @xmath39 beyond linear order , @xmath40 , the quadratic term @xmath41 gives rise to cubic interaction vertices proportional to @xmath42 in the bosonized model @xcite .",
    "hence , bosonization maps the original ( unsolvable ) fermionic many - body problem onto another unsolvable problem involving bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the hope is that perturbation theory for the effective boson model is well - defined and more convenient to carry out in practice than in the original fermion model @xcite .",
