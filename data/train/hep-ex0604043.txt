    "the standard model decay diagram for @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ dptomunu ] .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath2 mass , @xmath12 is the mass of the charged final state lepton , @xmath13 is a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element with a value we take equal to 0.225 @xcite , and @xmath14 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "0.00 cm    = 3.0 in    the decay is helicity suppressed because the virtual @xmath15 is a spin-1 particle , and the final state consists of a naturally left - handed spin-1/2 neutrino and a naturally right - handed spin-1/2 anti - lepton that have equal energies and opposite momenta .",
    "the ratio of decay rates for any two different leptons is then fixed by well - known masses .",
    "for example , for @xmath16 to @xmath17 , the expected ratio is    @xmath18    any deviation from this formula would be a manifestation of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this could occur if any other charged intermediate boson existed that coupled to leptons differently than mass - squared .",
    "then the couplings would be different for muons and @xmath0 s .",
    "this would be a manifest violation of lepton universality , which has identical couplings of the muon , the tau , and the electron to the gauge bosons ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "( we note that in some models of supersymmetry the charged higgs boson couples as mass - squared to the leptons and therefore its presence would not cause a deviation from eq .",
    "[ eq : rat ] @xcite . ) using measured masses @xcite , this expression yields a value of 2.65 with a negligibly small error .",
    "we have already reported @xcite @xmath21 and established an upper limit of @xmath22 .",
    "it remains to measure or limit @xmath16 , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "we note , for reference , that the predicted relative widths in the standard model are @xmath23 for the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 final states , respectively .",
    "the cleo - c detector is equipped to measure the momenta and directions of charged particles , identify charged hadrons , detect photons and determine with good precision their directions and energies .",
    "it has been described in more detail previously @xcite .",
    "particle identification is accomplished using both de / dx information in the tracking drift chamber and in a separate ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) @xcite .",
    "in this study we use 281 pb@xmath4 of cleo - c data produced in @xmath27 collisions and recorded at the @xmath5 resonance . at this energy ,",
    "the event sample consists of a mixture of pure @xmath28 , @xmath29 , three - flavor continuum , and @xmath30 events .",
    "there are also @xmath31 pairs , two - photon events , and non-@xmath32 decays of the @xmath5 , whose production rates are small enough for them not to contribute background in this study .",
    "this analysis follows very closely our previous study of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "first we fully reconstruct a sample of hadronic @xmath34 decays , that we call tags , and then search for tracks that are consistent with a @xmath35 from the decay sequence @xmath36 , @xmath37 , rather than a muon directly from two - body @xmath38 decay . besides using @xmath34 tags and searching for @xmath36 , @xmath37",
    "we also use the charge - conjugate @xmath2 tags and search for @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; in the rest of this paper we will not mention the charge - conjugate modes explicitly , but they are always used .",
    "the loss of rate compared to the muon case , caused by the @xmath41 of ( 11.06@xmath420.11)% @xcite , is somewhat compensated for by the larger @xmath36 branching ratio as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : equ_rate ] .",
    "this search has a smeared signal region as compared to the muon case because of the extra missing neutrino , and therefore backgrounds are a much more serious concern .",
    "we examine all the recorded events and retain those containing at least one charged @xmath38 candidate in the modes listed in table  [ tab : dreconnew ] .",
    "track selection , particle identification , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and muon selection cuts are identical to those described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have investigated using other @xmath0 decay modes but they all have significant problems . the semileptonic mode @xmath45 is embedded in a large @xmath2 semileptonic background .",
    "the @xmath46 mode has a mm@xmath47 resolution approximately twice as poor , and the @xmath48 mode has several additional associated backgrounds , for example @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that severely limit its usefulness .",
    "tagging modes are fully reconstructed by first evaluating the difference in the energy , @xmath52 , of the decay products with the beam energy .",
    "we require the absolute value of this difference to contain 98.8% of the signal events , i.e. to be within approximately 2.5 times the r.m.s width of the peak value .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "widths vary from 7 mev in the @xmath53 mode to 14 mev in the @xmath54 mode . for the selected events we then calculate the reconstructed @xmath34 beam - constrained mass defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 runs over all the final state particles .",
    "the beam - constrained mass has better resolution than merely calculating the invariant mass of the decay products since the beam has a small energy spread .",

    "we find @xmath67 .",
    "we caution the reader that this is not a definitive measurement but an intermediate step used in the process of forming an upper limit .",
    "( had we used the data to estimate the background , the branching fraction would be lower . )    since the result is not statistically significant we quote an upper limit of @xmath68 at 90% confidence level .",
    "the ratio to the expected rate in the standard model using our measured @xmath69 is @xmath70 at 90% confidence level .",
