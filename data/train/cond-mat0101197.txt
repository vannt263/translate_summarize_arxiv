    "corrections to scaling at continuous phase transitions have long been understood within the framework of the renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "irrelevant operators give rise to power - law corrections to scaling in , for example , the temperature - dependence of the correlation length , of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a universal correction - to - scaling exponent , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are nonuniversal amplitudes .",
    "( for a critical point at temperature @xmath11 , the scaling variable @xmath12 is conventionally defined by @xmath13 . ) in the case of a marginally irrelevant operator , both multiplicative and additive logarithmic corrections can occur , typically of the form @xmath14     \\;.\\ ] ]    however , it is possible for more exotic dependences to arise .",
    "this paper considers just such an example , namely the antiferromagnetic 3-state potts model on a square lattice .",
    "this model has the hamiltonian @xmath15 where the sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs of vertices on the square lattice , at each of which is a degree of freedom @xmath16 taking one of three possible states .",
    "the coupling is antiferromagnetic , that is , @xmath17 .",
    "one reason that this model is exotic is that its critical point occurs at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this is a bona fide critical point , exhibiting , for example , power - law decay of the order - parameter correlation functions . at nonzero temperature ,",
    "these correlation functions decay exponentially with a finite correlation length @xmath19 . in the past",
    "there has been some confusion concerning the correct choice of scaling variable at such zero - temperature critical points ; it does not necessarily correspond to setting @xmath20 to zero in the above definition of @xmath12 ( i.e.  to taking @xmath21 ) .",
    "in fact , this question is answered quite explicitly , at least for non - quantum critical points , by the renormalization group : the space of scaling variables is the tangent space at the fixed point to the manifold parametrized by the boltzmann weights of the model in question . in our case ,",
    "the low - temperature configurations correspond to modifying one of the ground states by allowing a nonzero density of nearest - neighbor bonds where @xmath22 ( we henceforth call these _ unsatisfied bonds _ ) .",
    "each unsatisfied bond occurs with boltzmann weight @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 ) , and therefore the correct scaling variable @xmath12 should be linear in @xmath23 .    the other , more interesting , reason that this model is unusual is that , as we shall discuss in detail in the next section , switching on the temperature excites not just one , but two , scaling operators .",
    "one of these operators turns out to be relevant , with renormalization - group eigenvalue @xmath25 ( hence scaling dimension @xmath26 ) , corresponding to @xmath27 , so that the leading behavior of the correlation length is @xmath28 .",
    "the other operator is marginal  not marginally irrelevant , but _",
    "strictly _ marginal in the sense that , taken alone , it would generate a line of fixed points with continuously varying exponents .",
    "the main result of this marginal operator is to give the exponent @xmath29 in the foregoing expression an effective dependence on the scaling variable @xmath30 itself : thus we find that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is presumably nonuniversal .",
    "it turns out , however , that in this model we can estimate the value of @xmath3 by an independent calculation .",
    "in particular , simple qualitative arguments show that @xmath33 , so that the asymptotic value of @xmath34 should be reached from below as @xmath35 ( and likewise for the staggered susceptibility ) .",
    "such an increase , following a minimum , was in fact found in extensive monte carlo simulations of this model by ferreira and sokal  @xcite .",
    "these authors attempted to fit their data with a variety of `` standard '' forms of corrections to scaling , including logarithms .",
    "though some of these anstze gave reasonable fits , none had a plausible theoretical basis ( see ( * ? ? ? * section 7.1 ) for detailed discussion ) .",
    "as we shall show in section  [ sec4 ] , the anomalous behavior found by ferreira and sokal is consistent with the unusual form ( [ corr ] ) over its expected range of validity , when @xmath3 is given the value that we extract independently in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "our ability to make such a theoretical analysis depends on a mapping of the model at zero temperature to a discrete height model that can be connected ( via a nonrigorous but convincing renormalization - group argument ) to the continuum theory of a free scalar boson @xcite .",
    "it is within the height - model approach that we are able to disentangle the behavior at nonzero temperature and argue that the two types of excitation , leading to the unusual scaling form ( [ corr ] ) , are present .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss the mapping to a height model and make the important observation that in this model ( unlike some other models with zero - temperature critical points ) the height mapping is well - defined also at nonzero temperatures .",
    "it is then straightforward to identify the two types of excitation in height - model language .",
    "the most relevant excitation has the nature of a vortex within the free - boson description , and standard coulomb - gas methods then lead to the prediction that @xmath36 .",
    "the other type of excitation has zero vorticity and , we argue , merely renormalizes the compactification radius ( or stiffness coefficient ) of the free field .",
    "however , this is not a rigorous argument , and it is important to check it independently .",
    "this we do in section  [ sec3 ] , by a direct numerical investigation of the modified height model in which only excitations of the second type are allowed , that is , the vortices are suppressed . in this case , the height model may be represented as a modified vertex model , which we analyze using transfer matrices and finite - size scaling .",
    "our results show clearly that these excitations are indeed strictly marginal : the modified vertex model is still critical and continues to have the central charge @xmath37 characteristic of a free boson .",
    "we directly measure the dependence of the stiffness coefficient on the fugacity @xmath30 of the excitations . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we put these pieces of information together to predict how the effective critical exponents like @xmath38 depend on @xmath23 , and hence extract the value of the parameter @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) for both the correlation length and the susceptibility .",
    "finally we compare these predictions with the monte carlo data of ferreira and sokal  @xcite . in the appendix",
    "we show how various non - universal quantities arising from the first - order effects of the non - vortex defects may be related to one another .",
    "it is convenient to label the potts states @xmath16 by the integers @xmath39 .",
    "the vertices @xmath40 of the square lattice are labeled by integer - valued coordinates @xmath41 , and the lattice is divided into even and odd sublattices on which @xmath42 is even or odd , respectively .",
    "let us introduce the variable @xmath43 $ ] , which takes the values 0 or 1 according to whether @xmath40 is on the even or the odd sublattice .",
    "we then define height variables @xmath44 by @xmath45 as illustrated in the table below :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     exactly at @xmath46 the above remark that the @xmath47 sector introduces frustration does not apply .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath48 and its first few derivatives at @xmath46 can therefore be based on the @xmath49 and @xmath47 sectors , yielding a better precision . to perform the derivatives",
    ", we simply numerically differentiate the free energies ( [ f(q ) ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "our transfer - matrix results can also be used to compute the average energy density , given here simply as the probability of having a triple arrow , @xmath52 . using ( [ zw ] ) we have @xmath53 , and based on the first two derivatives of the free energy we find @xmath54 in the model with vortices suppressed .",
    "this can be compared with the monte carlo results of ferreira and sokal for the full 3-state potts antiferromagnet ( i.e.  with vortices included ) , based on a fit to the low - temperature data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3 and figure 13 ) : @xmath55 the fact that the leading terms of the two expansions agree could easily have been anticipated , since vortices necessarily come in pairs , and thus enter only at order @xmath56 .",
    "putting together the results of sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] , we deduce the theoretical predictions @xmath57",

    "we plot @xmath74 versus @xmath68 ; for modest values of @xmath64 the corrections to scaling are actually _ stronger _ than in figure  [ fig.sec4.plot2 ] ( ! ) , but for large @xmath64 they are weaker and it is at least plausible that the curve is asymptotically horizontal .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig.sec4.plot4 ] we plot @xmath74 versus @xmath75 ; now the curve is compatible with linearity over the much wider range @xmath76 ( corresponding to @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) , and we estimate an intercept @xmath79 and an asymptotic slope @xmath80 .",
    "next we analyze the staggered susceptibility .",

    "we plot @xmath82 versus @xmath68 ; once again there is a lot of curvature , and it is unfeasible to extract reliable estimates of the limiting slope , but the data for @xmath69 are _ compatible _ with the predicted slope @xmath83 , provided that we choose an intercept @xmath84 . in figure  [ fig.sec4.chiplot3 ]",
    "we plot @xmath85 versus @xmath68 ; for modest values of @xmath64 the corrections to scaling are once again _ stronger _ than in figure  [ fig.sec4.chiplot2 ] , but for large @xmath64 they are weaker and it is at least plausible that the curve is asymptotically horizontal . finally , in figure  [ fig.sec4.chiplot4 ] we plot @xmath85 versus @xmath75 ; now the curve is compatible with linearity over the much wider range @xmath86 ( corresponding to @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) , and we estimate an intercept @xmath89 and an asymptotic slope @xmath90 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the available monte carlo data are _ compatible _ with the theoretical predictions ( [ theor_xi])/([theor_chi ] ) , although the evidence for these predictions  and in particular for the predicted values ( [ theor_b])/([theor_bprime ] ) of the nonuniversal constants @xmath3 and @xmath58  is admittedly less than overwhelming .",
    "our analysis does , in any case , give a simple explanation of why the limiting values of @xmath63 and @xmath81 are approached from below .",
    "it would be useful to obtain higher - precision monte carlo data at correlation lengths @xmath91 ( corresponding to @xmath92 ) in order to make a better test of our theoretical predictions .",
    "it is curious that the asymptotic behavior in this model is attained only at rather large correlation lengths .",
