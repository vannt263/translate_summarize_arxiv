    "after the work by diaconis and sturmfels ( @xcite ) , a _",
    "markov basis _",
    ", a key notion in the field of computational algebraic statistics , has attracted special attentions among researchers both in statistics and algebra . in this first work",
    ", they show the fundamental relation between the generators of toric ideals and the markov bases and establish a procedure for sampling from discrete conditional distributions by constructing an irreducible markov chain on a given sample space . by virtue of this relation",
    ", we can perform markov chain monte carlo methods to estimate conditional @xmath0 values for various statistical problems if we can obtain the generator of corresponding toric ideals .",
    "readers can find various theoretical results on structure of markov bases such as minimality or invariance , and markov bases of important statistical models such as hierarchical models of multi - dimensional contingency tables in @xcite .    in parallel , it is also valuable to connect known classes of toric ideals to statistical models .",
    "such a motivation yields attractive research topics from algebraic fields to statistics .",
    "for example , @xcite shows the relation between the generator of the toric ideals for the segre  veronese configuration and the special independence models in the testing problems of group - wise selections .",
    "this result is further generalized to a class of configurations called nested configurations in @xcite . as another example",
    ", relations between regular two - level fractional factorial designs and cut ideals are shown in @xcite .",
    "the arguments in this paper comes from the same motivation to these works .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the statistical models corresponding to the algebraic object known as a _ centrally symmetric configuration of root system @xmath1 .",
    "_ the notion of centrally symmetric configurations ( @xcite ) is one of the new attractive topics in algebra since it yields many `` toric rings '' that have important algebraic properties ( normal and gorenstein ) .",
    "see @xcite . on the other hand , grbner bases of the toric ideal arising from the configuration of @xmath1",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , convex polytopes arising from the centrally symmetric configuration of @xmath1 are studied in @xcite . in this paper , we show that the centrally symmetric configuration corresponds to the first - order models for the symmetric designs of experiments for multi - level factors . as typical examples of such designs , we consider box - behnken designs in this paper .",
    "markov chain monte carlo procedure in the framework of design of experiments is introduced in @xcite and @xcite . in these works , regular two - level and three - level designs",
    "are considered .",
    "however , non - regular designs are difficult to treat in general . in this paper",
    ", we present a new method for analyzing non - regular designs .    the construction of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the markov chain monte carlo methods for design of experiments . in section 3",
    ", we give a definition of the centrally symmetric configuration and present statistical models .",
    "we also introduce the box - behnken designs and show that the model matrix of the first - order models for the box - behnken designs corresponds to the centrally symmetric configuration of root system @xmath1 . in section 4 ,",
    "we give the grbner bases of the centrally symmetric configuration of root system @xmath1 . in section 5 ,",
    "we give numerical example for an imaginary data set . finally , we give some discussion in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we introduce markov chain monte carlo methods for testing the fitting of the log - linear models for fractional factorial designs with count observations .",
    "we consider the designs with @xmath2 controllable factors . for @xmath3 ,",
    "write @xmath4 as the level of the @xmath5-th factor .",
    "for example , if @xmath5-th factor has three levels , it is common to write @xmath6 . the full factorial design @xmath7 is given as @xmath8 and the fractional factorial design @xmath9 is a subset of @xmath10 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath11 runs ( i.e. , points ) in @xmath9 .",
    "for convenience , we order the points of @xmath9 appropriately and consider a @xmath12 design matrix @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the level of @xmath5-th factor in @xmath15-th run for @xmath16 .",
    "we write the observations as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the transpose . in this paper",
    ", we consider the poisson sampling scheme , i.e. , we suppose that the observations are counts of some events and the observation @xmath19 is nonnegative integer vector .",
    "we also suppose that only one observation is obtained for each run .",
    "this is a natural setting because the set of the totals for each run is the sufficient statistics for the parameter in the poisson sampling scheme .",
    "therefore the observation @xmath19 are realizations from @xmath11 mutually independent poisson random variables @xmath20 with the mean parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the log - linear model @xmath22 for the parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a @xmath5-th covariate for the @xmath15-th run and @xmath25 is the dimension of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "if we write @xmath27 for @xmath28 , the log - linear model ( [ eqn : log - linear - model ] ) is written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "we call a @xmath31 matrix @xmath32 as a _ model matrix _ of the log - linear model ( [ eqn : log - linear - model ] ) .    to judge the fitting of the log - linear model ( [ eqn : log - linear - model ] )",
    ", we can consider various goodness - of - fit tests .",
    "in the goodness - of - fit tests , the model ( [ eqn : log - linear - model ] ) is treated as the null model , whereas the saturated model is treated as the alternative model . under the null model ( [ eqn : log - linear - model ] ) , the sufficient statistics for the ( nuisance ) parameter @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 from the factorization @xmath35 therefore the conditional distribution of @xmath19 for the given sufficient statistics is written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the observation vector and @xmath38 is the normalizing constant determined from the sufficient statistics @xmath39 as @xmath40 and @xmath41    in this paper , we consider goodness - of - fit tests based on the conditional distribution ( [ eqn : conditional - distribution ] ) .",
    "there are several choices of the test statistics @xmath42 .",
    "frequently used choices are the likelihood ratio statistics @xmath43 or the pearson @xmath44 statistics @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the maximum likelihood estimate for @xmath47 under the null model ( i.e. , fitted value ) .",
    "a simple way of judging the significance for the observed value @xmath48 is the asymptotic @xmath0 value based on the asymptotic distribution @xmath49 of the test statistics .",
    "however , the fitting of the asymptotic approximation may be sometimes poor .",
    "therefore we consider conditional exact @xmath0 values in this paper . based on the conditional distribution ( [ eqn : conditional - distribution ] ) , the exact conditional @xmath0 value is written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the test function of @xmath42 .",
    "of course , if we can calculate the exact @xmath0 value of ( [ eqn : exact - p - value ] ) and ( [ eqn : test - function ] ) , it is best .",
    "however , the cardinality of the set @xmath52 becomes huge for moderate sizes of data and the calculation of the normalizing constant @xmath38 of ( [ eqn : normalizing - constant ] ) is usually computationally infeasible .",
    "instead , we consider a markov chain monte carlo method to evaluate the conditional @xmath0 values .",
    "it should be noted that we need not calculate the normalizing constant ( [ eqn : normalizing - constant ] ) to evaluate the @xmath0 values by the markov chain monte carlo methods .",
    "this point is one of the important advantages of the markov chain monte carlo methods .    to perform the markov chain monte carlo procedure",
    ", we have to construct an irreducible markov chain over the conditional sample space ( [ eqn : fiber ] ) with the stationary distribution ( [ eqn : conditional - distribution ] ) .",
    "if such a chain is constructed , we can sample from the chain as @xmath53 after discarding some initial burn - in steps , and estimate the @xmath0 values as @xmath54 such a chain can be constructed easily by _",
    "markov bases_. once a markov basis is obtained , we can construct a connected , aperiodic and reversible markov chain over the conditional sample space ( [ eqn : fiber ] ) , which can be modified so as to have the stationary distribution ( [ eqn : conditional - distribution ] ) by the metropolis - hastings procedure .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for details .",
    "the markov basis is characterized algebraically as follows .",
    "write the variables @xmath55 and consider the polynomial ring @xmath56 $ ] over a field @xmath57 .",
    "consider the integer kernel of the transpose of the model matrix @xmath32 , @xmath58 .",
    "for each @xmath59 , define a binomial in @xmath56 $ ] as @xmath60 then the binomial ideal in @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath61 is called a _",
    "toric ideal of the configuration @xmath62_. then for a generating set of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , the set of integer vectors @xmath65 constitutes a markov basis . see @xcite for details .",
    "as we have seen in section 2 , if we can obtain a generator of @xmath63 , a toric ideal of the configuration @xmath62 , we can judge the fitting of the statistical model expressed by the model matrix @xmath32 by the conditional @xmath0 values estimated by the markov chain monte carlo methods . for small sizes of problems ,",
    "we can rely on various softwares such as 4ti2 ( @xcite ) to compute generators of the toric ideals .",
    "however , for problems of large sizes , it is usually very difficult to compute markov bases or grbner bases for given ideals . on the other hand ,",
    "if we have theoretical results on the structure of the corresponding ideals , it is very easy to perform the markov chain monte carlo procedure for such configurations .",
    "the _ centrally symmetric configuration _ is an example of such cases .",
    "the centrally symmetric configuration is given in ( @xcite ) as follows .",
    "let @xmath66 be an integer matrix for which no column vector is a zero vector .",
    "then the centrally symmetric configuration of @xmath67 is the @xmath68 integer matrix @xmath69 it is known that the `` toric ring '' @xmath70 $ ] of @xmath71 is normal and gorenstein if there exists a squarefree initial ideal with respect to a reverse lexicographic order where the smallest variable corresponds to the first column of @xmath71 .",
    "see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.1 ) .    as natural statistical models and designs where ( the transpose of ) the model matrix is centrally symmetric configurations , we consider the simple first - order models as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath72 is a _ symmetric design including the origin _",
    ", i.e. , a design satisfying @xmath73 write @xmath74 its design matrix , where @xmath14 is the level of @xmath5-th factor in @xmath15-th run for @xmath75",
    ". then we see that the transpose of the model matrix @xmath76 is centrally symmetric",
    ". corresponding log - linear model ( [ eqn : log - linear - model ] ) is written as @xmath77 we call the model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) as a _ first - order model _ in this paper .",
    "the interpretation of the first - order model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) is as follows .",
    "suppose there are adequate meanings both in the order of the factors and the interval of the factors for the design @xmath9 .",
    "then the model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) means that the logarithm of the influence to the response variable is proportional to the difference of the levels for each factor . in other words ,",
    "the parameter @xmath78 represents the main effect of the @xmath5-th factor for @xmath3 .",
    "the first order model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) is a discrete version of the first - order model arising in the context of the _ response surface methodology_. see section 9 of @xcite , for example .",
    "a typical example of the symmetric designs is also arising in the context of the response surface methodology as _ box - behnken designs_.    the box - behnken design is a family of three - level fractional factorial designs introduced by @xcite .",
    "this design is constructed by combining two - level factorial designs with balanced ( or partially balanced ) incomplete block designs in a particular manner . to illustrate the concept of the box - behnken designs , consider the case of three factors ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) .",
    "a balanced incomplete block design with three factors and three blocks is given as follows .",
    "@xmath80 the box - behnken design is constructed by replacing the two circles ( @xmath81 ) in each block by the two columns of the two - level @xmath82 design and add a column of zeros where a circle does not appear , and adding a run at the origin . in this example , the box - behnken design is constructed as follows .",
    "@xmath83 similarly , by combining various incomplete block designs with two - level full ( or fractional ) factorial designs , various three - level fractional factorial designs are obtained . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the box - behnken designs constructed from the two - level @xmath82 design and the balanced incomplete block designs with the block size @xmath84 , the number of factors ( or treatments ) @xmath2 , the number of blocks @xmath85 and the number of replicates for each factor @xmath86 , with a single run at the origin .",
    "note that it is common to consider the designs with several runs at the origins in this field .",
    "see @xcite or chapter 9 of @xcite for details . however , we only consider the designs with single observations even in the origin .",
    "therefore the box - behnken design considered in this paper has @xmath87 runs for @xmath2 factor case .    for these box - behnken designs ,",
    "we consider the first - order model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) with the model matrix ( [ eqn : m - for - first - order - model ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath88 in our cases .",
    "then we see that the transpose of the model matrix , @xmath62 , has the centrally symmetric structure ( [ eqn : centrally - symmetric ] ) with @xmath89 . for example , the transpose of the model matrix of the first - order model for the three factors case is given by @xmath90 which is the centrally symmetric configuration of @xmath91    following the arguments of section 2 , we can judge the fitting of the first - order model for the box - behnken designs by the markov chain monte carlo methods , if we obtain the generators of the toric ideal of the configuration of this type .",
    "now we show the structure of the grbner bases of the centrally symmetric configurations for the box - behnken designs .",
    "because the grbner basis is a generator of the ideals , we can use the grbner basis as a markov basis . as an important fact",
    ", the transpose of the model matrix for the first - order models for the box - behnken designs is characterized as the configuration of the _ root system @xmath1_.    let @xmath92 stand for the canonical unit coordinate vectors of @xmath93 and @xmath94 the finite set which consists of the origin @xmath95 of @xmath93 together with @xmath96 let @xmath97   = k[t_{1 } , \\ldots , t_{n } , t_{1}^{-1 } , \\ldots , t_{n}^{-1 } , s]$ ] denote the laurent polynomial ring in @xmath98 variables over a field @xmath57 .",

    ", we consider the fitting of the first - order model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) based on the likelihood ratio statistics ( [ eqn : likelihood - ratio ] ) .",
    "the fitted values under the null model is calculated in the last column of table [ tbl : aspergillus - data ] .",
    "the likelihood ratio is @xmath284 with @xmath285 degree of freedom .",
    "therefore the asymptotic @xmath0 value is @xmath286 from the asymptotic @xmath287 distribution . to evaluate the fitting of the first - order model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) , we perform the markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "we use the grbner basis given in example [ ex : n=3-case ] as a markov basis .",
    "after @xmath288 burn - in steps from the observed data as the initial state , we derive @xmath289 samples by metropolis - hasting algorithm . among these samples ,",
    "@xmath290 samples have the larger likelihood ratio values than the observed @xmath284 .",
    "therefore the conditional @xmath0 value is estimated as @xmath291 , which suggests the good fitting of the first - order model ( [ eqn : first - order - model ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : aspergillus - histgram ] is the histogram of the sample likelihood ratio statistics with the asymptotic @xmath287 distribution .",
    "in this paper , we present a new method for analyzing non - regular fractional factorial designs .",
    "the motivation of this paper is a new finding on the structure of the grbner bases of the centrally symmetric configurations of root system @xmath1 . as we have seen in the paper",
    ", we can relate the theoretical results in the algebraic field to the statistical problems for the box - behnken designs .",
    "our model is simple and fundamental .",
    "in fact , we usually consider more complicated models such as second - order model for the analysis of the box - behnken designs .",
    "however , the structure of the markov bases or the grbner bases for the second - order model is very complicated .",
    "though the markov chain monte carlo methods can be considered for general non - regular designs , the structure of the markov bases is only revealed for simple models such as the hierarchical models for the regular designs at present .",
    "therefore we think our contribution on the new results of the non - regular designs is important . besides , compared to the continuous data analysis on the assumption of the normality",
    ", there are very few experiments are reported treating the discrete data arising in the fractional factorial designs .",
    "we think our markov chain monte carlo procedure is very simple and can be used easily , and can be one of the powerful choices in the analysis of the discrete data .",
