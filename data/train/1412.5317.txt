    "over the past few years , several groups have reported first experimental signatures for the elusive majorana bound state in superconducting hybrid devices @xcite .",
    "majorana bound states exist near the ends of topologically nontrivial one - dimensional ( 1d ) superconductors , and many proposals have appeared on how to probe them @xcite .",
    "likewise , the boundary of a 2d topological superconductor ( ts ) can host propagating gapless majorana fermion states @xcite , with different properties as compared to the mostly studied majorana bound states .",
    "recent experiments on inas / gasb @xcite , hgte / cdte @xcite , or topological insulator @xcite heterostructures with @xmath1-wave superconductors have indeed reported an edge - state dominated fraunhofer pattern of the josephson current .",
    "these developments highlight the urgent need for realistic proposals on how to prepare , manipulate , and detect 1d majorana edge states .",
    "we here consider the case of a time - reversal symmetric 2d ts with counterpropagating ( right- and left - moving ) majorana edge states of opposite spin polarization @xcite .",
    "a major obstacle to the detection of these `` helical '' majorana modes arises from their charge neutrality . as a consequence ,",
    "transport experiments are difficult , requiring one to study thermal transport or interferometric devices @xcite . moreover , although a zero - bias tunneling conductance peak due to the majorana edge is expected @xcite , similar peaks are also caused by other mechanisms @xcite .",
    "schematic setup : two quantum dots located near the helical majorana edge states of a 2d ts which occupies the @xmath2 half - plane with @xmath3 . for strong on - site repulsion , the dots are equivalent to spin-@xmath0 operators , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , separated by a distance @xmath6 .",
    "they are exchange - coupled ( @xmath7 ) to the local ising spin density of the majorana edge , and rkky - coupled to each other ( @xmath8 ) through bulk ts modes .",
    ", width=340 ]    we here propose a setup , see fig .  [ fig1 ] , where the physics of helical majorana fermions can be probed in a direct and realistic manner through their coupling to two quantum dots located near the boundary of a 2d ts , see fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "assuming a standard parameter regime with strongly repulsive on - dot coulomb interaction , each dot corresponds to a spin-@xmath0 operator @xcite .",
    "we imagine that the dots are arranged slightly above the superconducting plane , with an insulating layer separating them from the ts .",
    "tunnel couplings connecting the dots to the majorana edge then imply the presence of an exchange coupling , @xmath7 , to the ising spin density of the majorana edge at the respective location .",
    "( in what follows , we often refer to the dots simply as `` spins . '' ) the corresponding single - dot case was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and kondo physics was found in a magnetic field .",
    "however , the predicted quantum phase transition occurs only for unphysical parameter values @xcite .    for two dots ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we instead encounter a majorana version of the classic two - impurity kondo problem @xcite . in this setup , we predict clear signatures of the helical majorana edge to appear in the `` spin '' dynamics of the dots .",
    "the rich physics found for the two - impurity helical majorana problem arises from the interplay between ising - like exchange couplings and indirect ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) spin - spin interactions @xcite mediated by the ts .",
    "we find that the majorana edge causes long - range rkky contributions , which we nonperturbatively determine below .",
    "in addition , bulk ts modes mediate an su@xmath9-symmetric ferromagnetic rkky coupling ( @xmath10 ) , plus an ising - type antiferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "these couplings are especially pronounced when the spins bind shiba states inside the ts gap @xcite .    before turning to derivations and detailed discussions ,",
    "let us briefly summarize our main results .",
    "( i ) the low - energy theory for the two - impurity helical majorana problem can be solved analytically . in the zero - field case , for a wide parameter regime , we find that the ground state is a fully entangled triplet state of both spins even when they are widely separated .",
    "this long - range entanglement is rather unique and of interest in quantum information applications @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the helical majorana edge causes an ising - type antiferromagnetic rkky coupling , @xmath12 , which exhibits a slow decay with spin - spin distance @xmath6 .",
    "this result holds for arbitrary @xmath7 , even though conventional rkky theory assumes small @xmath7 .",
    "( iii ) experimentally monitoring the weakly damped spin dynamics after a magnetic field quench allows one to extract clear signatures for helical majorana fermions through the predicted universal quality factor , see eq .   below .",
    "the magnetic fields can be produced by using ferromagnetic finger gates .",
    "time - dependent measurements of the dot spins can be performed with high precision using available state tomography techniques , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the setup in fig .  [ fig1 ] thus offers a direct way to manipulate and detect the helical majorana fermion edge state of a 2d time - reversal invariant ts .",
    "apart from the above - mentioned platforms , our predictions also apply to bilayer rashba quantum wells @xcite and exotic triplet - paired superconductors @xcite .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the setup and the theoretical model to describe it .",
    "we then turn to the perturbative regime of small @xmath7 in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where we derive the rkky interaction mediated by the majorana edge .",
    "in addition , we provide an explicit solution of the problem at not too low energy scales .",
    "the low - energy regime is then discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , where we show that the problem can be mapped to a dissipative quantum impurity problem .",
    "concrete predictions for the resulting spin - boson like dynamics are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , where we also comment on the unique signatures of helical majorana fermions in such experiments . finally , we conclude with a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we work in units with @xmath13 .",
    "we consider a time - reversal symmetric 2d ts located in the @xmath2 half - plane @xmath3 , which hosts 1d helical majorana fermions near the edge . on energy scales below the bulk ts gap @xmath14",
    ", the ts hamiltonian reduces to the gapless edge contribution @xcite @xmath15 with self - adjoint majorana field operators , @xmath16 , subject to the anticommutator algebra @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "weak time - reversal invariant perturbations , e.g. , due to spin - orbit coupling or elastic disorder , can not gap out the edge state and may only renormalize the edge velocity @xmath19 .",
    "importantly , because of the majorana anticommutator algebra , the spin density operator has only one nonvanishing component , @xmath20 this ising property reflects the majorana `` half - fermion '' character and is in contrast to helical dirac fermions , where only expectation values of the other spin density components vanish but not the operators themselves . the corresponding `` ising direction '' , @xmath21 , of the spin polarization depends on the actual ts realization @xcite . in most applications ,",
    "the ising direction is in the ts plane .",
    "we therefore put @xmath22 for instance , using the same coordinates as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we find @xmath23 for the ts realizations in refs .",
    "@xcite , while @xmath24 for the fu - kane proposal @xcite .",
    "next we consider two quantum dots at @xmath25 near the edge of the ts . in experimental realizations ,",
    "the dots could be displaced away from the ts plane along the @xmath26-axis , with finite tunnel couplings to both the majorana edge and to bulk ts modes , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . taking dot parameters within the standard local - moment regime of strong on - site",
    "coulomb interaction @xcite , the dots correspond to spin-@xmath0 operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . with @xmath27 in eq .",
    ", tunnel couplings between the dots and the majorana edge imply ising exchange couplings @xcite , @xmath28,\\ ] ] where we assume the same @xmath7 for both spins , and @xmath29 denotes the projection of the respective spin operator to the ising direction , @xmath30    although gapped bulk ts modes do not appear in eq .",
    ", they are important in mediating rkky interactions between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . treating the exchange coupling , @xmath31 , between the spins and the bulk ts modes perturbatively ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite , the full hamiltonian reads @xmath32 with @xmath33 note that @xmath34 does not include the edge - mediated rkky interaction . for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the superconducting coherence length and @xmath37 the bulk fermi velocity ,",
    "the bulk - induced rkky couplings are estimated as @xmath38 for the case of arbitrary @xmath39 , see ref .",
    "the su@xmath9-invariant term @xmath40 in eq",
    ".   favors ferromagnetic alignment of both spins , while the ising term @xmath41 favors antiferromagnetic alignment along the @xmath42-axis .",
    "we note that similar rkky interactions also appear in the conventional two - impurity kondo problem once spin - orbit couplings are taken into account @xcite .",
    "however , here we have @xmath43 because of particle - hole symmetry , and the usual @xmath44-oscillations with distance , see ref .",
    "@xcite , are completely absent in our case .",
    "finally , we have also included a magnetic zeeman field proportional to @xmath45 in eq .",
    ", which is assumed to act only on the total dot spin .",
    "such a field could be produced by suitable ferromagnetic finger gates . without loss of generality",
    ", we put @xmath46 .",
    "the model ( [ fullmodel ] ) describes the two - impurity helical majorana problem .",
    "it differs from the two - impurity kondo problem for dirac fermions @xcite , which hosts kondo physics and an unstable non - fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "this difference is present even when allowing for spin - orbit induced anisotropy effects in the conventional problem @xcite , and can be rationalized by noting that for the majorana case , we have exchange couplings connecting the impurity spins to the ising spin density only . as we show in detail below , this distinction leads to rather different physics as compared to the results in refs .",
    "we begin our analysis with the small-@xmath7 limit .",
    "the effect of the majorana edge on the spin dynamics can then be taken into account by perturbation theory in @xmath7 .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain the additional ising - like rkky contribution , @xmath47 with the density of states @xmath48 of the majorana edge .",
    "in contrast to the bulk - induced ising - like rkky term @xmath41 in eq .  , the anisotropy axis is now set by @xmath49 .",
    "note that the slow @xmath50 decay of @xmath51 is as for conventional 1d dirac fermions .",
    "in fact , by replacing @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ rkkyeq ] ) , the @xmath43 ising variant of the well - known 1d rkky coupling @xcite is recovered .    for small @xmath7 ,",
    "the coupled spin dynamics is thus captured by the effective hamiltonian @xmath53 with the total spin operator , @xmath54 we then obtain @xmath55 using singlet ( @xmath56 ) and triplet ( @xmath57 with @xmath58 ) states with spin quantization axis along the @xmath42-direction , @xmath59 the singlet state decouples and the remaining @xmath60 matrix representation for @xmath61 can be readily diagonalized .    to illustrate the physics described by eq .",
    ", we now consider the case @xmath62 . to simplify expressions",
    ", it is convenient to shift the overall energy scale such that the singlet state @xmath63 , which is always an eigenstate , has the energy @xmath64 .",
    "the triplet state @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , is also an eigenstate with energy @xmath67 the @xmath68 and @xmath69 triplet states hybridize , resulting in the energies @xmath70 we now discuss the resulting ground state for @xmath71 with @xmath24 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "first , when the ising direction is oriented along the @xmath42-axis , i.e. , for @xmath24 , noting that all rkky couplings ( @xmath72 ) are positive , we find that the entangled triplet state @xmath65 is always the ground state .",
    "this state minimizes both the ferromagnetic su@xmath9-symmetric rkky term @xmath40 and the antiferromagnetic ising rkky interaction @xmath73 . for typical parameters",
    "@xcite and @xmath74  nm , the excitation energies above this ground state correspond to temperatures @xmath75  k. at lower temperatures , both dots are therefore fully entangled due to ts - mediated long - range rkky interactions .",
    "second , for @xmath23 , using @xmath76 , we see in a similar fashion that the ground state is either again the triplet state , @xmath65 for @xmath77 , or it corresponds to @xmath78 for @xmath79 . as the spin - spin distance @xmath6 is varied through a critical value @xmath80 determined by @xmath81 , we thus observe that a quantum phase transition occurs .",
    "this transition is caused by the competition between the majorana- and the bulk - induced ising - like rkky terms , which have different anisotropy axes for @xmath82 .",
    "in this section , we turn to the low - energy regime and thereby discuss the physics beyond the perturbative small-@xmath7 regime . to start ,",
    "let us combine the majorana fields into a chiral dirac fermion field , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath83 where eq .",
    "yields the equivalent form @xmath84 the ising exchange term in eq .",
    "( [ hj ] ) then reads @xmath85   \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac12 j(s_{i,1}-s_{i,2 } )   \\left [ \\psi^\\dagger(r/2)\\psi^\\dagger(-r/2)+ { \\rm h.c . }",
    "\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the total spin @xmath86 note that @xmath87 effectively describes non - local single - particle processes of either potential scattering or pairing type .    on energy scales below @xmath88 ,",
    "however , the non - locality present in eq",
    ".   generates only corrections that are irrelevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense .",
    "indeed , we find that the low - energy expansion , @xmath89 , comes from the local operators @xmath90 the term @xmath91 is precisely marginal ( scaling dimension 1 ) , while the leading irrelevant operator @xmath92 has scaling dimension 2 . performing a standard one - loop rg analysis , using the operator product expansions for the fermion operators in eq .",
    ", it immediately follows that the only new operator generated during the rg flow is precisely the rkky term .",
    "the @xmath91 term does not renormalize , whereas the @xmath92 term flows to zero .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath92 can safely be taken into account by renormalization of @xmath51 , and the fermionic low - energy theory is given by @xmath93    to proceed further , we now bosonize the chiral fermion in eq .  , see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath94 using the chiral boson field @xmath95 with commutator @xmath96_-= i\\pi { \\rm sgn}(x - x'),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is taken as short - distance cutoff length . the euclidean action corresponding to @xmath97",
    "is then given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a discrete imaginary - time spin path .",
    "the benefit of this step is that we have a gaussian action for the bosonic field variables , which can therefore be integrated out exactly .    performing the gaussian field integration over @xmath100 ,",
    "we finally obtain the effective spin action @xmath101 the first term corresponds to ohmic damping @xcite .",
    "we mention in passing that this term vanishes for a constant spin path , @xmath102 .",
    "the second term instead describes once again the rkky coupling @xmath51 due to the majorana edge .",
    "as expected from the chiral anomaly of 1d fermions @xcite , no orders higher than @xmath103 appear in eq .  .",
    "this indicates that up to a prefactor of order unity , eq .",
    "stays in fact valid beyond the perturbative small-@xmath7 regime .",
    "we now show that , up to an overall irrelevant energy shift , the low - energy hamiltonian for the two spins can be written as @xmath104,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is a gaussian random field with zero mean and @xmath61 is defined in eq .  .",
    "the `` bath '' hamiltonian @xmath106 here describes an infinite set of harmonic oscillators generating the correlation function @xmath107 for complex time @xmath108 . to show the correctness of eq .",
    ", we note that when averaging the partition function corresponding to eq .   over the gaussian random field @xmath105 , we should arrive back at the effective two - impurity action ( [ seff ] ) @xcite .",
    "this procedure allows us to determine the bath correlation function @xmath109 .",
    "indeed , by averaging over @xmath105 and comparison to eq .  , we find that eq .   must be given by @xmath110}{\\sinh[\\beta\\omega/2]}.\\ ] ] in eq .  , we allow for finite temperature @xmath111 and state the result for complex time @xmath108 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath109 is here expressed in terms of a so - called ohmic spectral density @xcite , @xmath112 which in turn contains the dimensionless damping parameter @xmath113 for physically relevant parameters , the damping strength is small , @xmath114 . for @xmath115 , eq",
    ".   then yields a characteristic inverse - square time dependence , @xmath116 the general formulation in eq .   offers a convenient starting point to discuss the dissipative real - time dynamics of the two coupled spins",
    "in what follows , we consider this effective spin dynamics in a magnetic field and show that it contains unique signatures of the underlying helical majorana fermions .",
    "for clarity , we here choose the ising direction corresponding to @xmath24 and put @xmath117 , but we believe that our conclusions apply generally .    using the parameter @xmath118 we first observe from eq .",
    "that for @xmath119 , the field component @xmath120 along the ising direction drives a quantum phase transition from the entangled @xmath65 state , which is the ground state for @xmath121 , to the separable polarized triplet state @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , assuming that the system parameters are in the regime @xmath124 it is justified to project eq .   to the subspace spanned by @xmath122 and @xmath65 only . defining pauli matrices @xmath125 in that subspace , such a projection arrives at the well - known spin - boson model @xcite , @xmath126    since the damping parameter @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ ohmic2 ] ) is small , the spin dynamics found after a sudden change ( `` quench '' ) of the magnetic field will then show weakly damped oscillations .",
    "for instance , taking a constant field component @xmath128 and suddenly switching @xmath120 at time @xmath129 , such that we have a large negative @xmath130 at @xmath131 but a vanishing value afterwards , @xmath132 , the @xmath115 spin dynamics follows from the exact long - time result @xcite @xmath133 where the average is taken using @xmath134 .",
    "the physical spin dynamics then follows from the relation @xmath135 equation ( [ dampedosc ] ) is characterized by the damping rate @xmath136 and by the quality factor @xmath137 connecting the damping rate to the oscillation frequency , @xmath138 importantly , the quality factor is universal in the sense that it is independent of @xmath128 or other microscopic parameters . in eq .",
    ", we use the energy scale @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a prefactor of order unity ( for its precise value , see ref .",
    "the above reasoning suggests that an experimental observation of damped spin oscillations with universal ( @xmath128-independent ) quality factor , see eq .  , constitutes a nontrivial signature for helical majorana fermions .",
    "in this work , we have proposed to couple two quantum dots in the local moment regime ( where they correspond to spin-@xmath0 impurities ) to the helical majorana edge states of a 2d topological superconductor .",
    "the superconductor then causes edge- and bulk - induced rkky interactions among the two spins , where the resulting low - energy theory can be solved in an essentially exact manner .",
    "notably , the physics found for this two - impurity helical majorana problem strongly differs from the respective helical dirac problem , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . in the presence of time - dependent magnetic fields ,",
    "the spin dynamics is characterized by weakly damped coherent oscillations with universal quality factor . in a setup as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we predict experimentally accessible signatures for helical majorana fermions in a topological superconductor by coupling to two quantum dots in the local moment regime ( corresponding to spin-@xmath0 impurities ) . taking into account rkky interactions mediated by bulk and edge modes , </S>",
    "<S> where the latter cause a long - range antiferromagnetic ising coupling , we formulate and solve the low - energy theory for this two - impurity helical majorana problem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the long - time spin dynamics after a magnetic field quench displays weakly damped oscillations with universal quality factor . </S>"
