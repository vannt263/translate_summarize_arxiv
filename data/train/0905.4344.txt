    "this work and yakovina et al . ( 2009 ) make the following conclusions :    * the effective temperature of dy per is in range 2900 @xmath1 t@xmath0  @xmath1 3300 k. our estimations of t@xmath0  are below estimations by indirect methods .",
    "we confirm that dy per is the coolest r crb type star .",
    "* for every value of t@xmath0  , the spectral synthesis technique gives large ambiguities in the [ fe / h ]  , log(c / o ) , [ n / fe ] , h / he atmospheric parameters .",
    "however , the qualitative analysis provided by some authors and physical constraints suggest that the most likely combination of atmospheric parameters of dy per is \\{t@xmath0  = 3100 k , [ fe / h ]  = 0 , log(c / o)=0.6 , [ n / fe]=0 , ( h / he)@xmath13 } with jorgensen s line lists for molecules c@xmath2  and cn . *",
    "we believe that new observations of dy per in a wider spectral region , and at high spectral resolution and with independent methods of analysis will allow us to increase confidence in the determination of the atmospheric parameters of dy per .    _",
