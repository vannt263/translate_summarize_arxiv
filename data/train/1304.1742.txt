    "the recent experimental realization of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite and fermionic gases  @xcite has stimulated considerable research interest .",

    "ultracold atomic gases promise to be an ideal system for the generation of versatile artificial gauge fields  @xcite and studying such abelian or even non - abelian gauge fields is relevant not only in mimicking solid state physics , but potentially even to fundamental theories such as quantum electro- or chromodynamics  @xcite .    in the above context , ground state properties of soc - becs , including phase separation and the existence of the stripe phase  @xcite , as well as the collective dynamics and oscillations  @xcite ,",

    "while these structures have been studied in single- and multi - component becs @xcite , soc can significantly enrich their structural , stability and dynamical properties .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to highlight the above by presenting and analyzing dark soliton states in soc - becs confined in a highly anisotropic ( quasi-1d ) parabolic trap . employing a multiscale expansion method",
    ", we find three different dark soliton families , featuring either a constant or a spatially modulated background density ; in the latter case , dark solitons occur as excited states on top of the stripe phase of soc - becs ( we call these states `` stripe solitons '' ) .",
    "we perform a bogolyubov - de gennes ( bdg ) linearization analysis of the above soliton families , showing that for our parameter values constant background solitons are always stable , while stripe solitons are stable only close to the linear limit .",

    "second _ anomalous mode , which does not exist in single- or multi - component becs , and is only sustained due to the double well structure of the soc single particle spectrum , featuring two minima . exciting this mode",
