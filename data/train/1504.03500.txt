    "this introductory section is mostly a brief reformulation and adaptation of some results stated and proved in @xcite in terms of integer nowhere - zero flows and then in @xcite in the more general setting of real valued flows .    given a real number @xmath9 , a * circular nowhere - zero @xmath7-flow * ( @xmath7-cnzf for short ) in a graph @xmath10 is an assignment @xmath11 $ ] and an orientation @xmath12 of @xmath1 , such that @xmath13 is a * flow * in @xmath12 .",
    "that is , for every vertex @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , respectively @xmath17 , are the sets of edges directed from , respectively towards @xmath18 in @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly defined is :    the * circular flow number * @xmath19 of a graph @xmath1 is the infimum of the set of real numbers @xmath7 , for which @xmath1 admits an @xmath7-cnzf .",
    "if @xmath1 has a bridge then we define @xmath20 .",
    "the notion of @xmath7-cnzf was first introduced in @xcite , while observing that @xmath21-coloring , previously studied by bondy and hell @xcite , can be interpreted as the dual of a real ( rather than integer)-valued nowhere - zero flow .",
    "the existence of @xmath19 and the fact that it is always rational , was also observed and stated in @xcite .",
    "* integer * nowhere - zero flows are much more widely known and intensively studied , since first presented by w. tutte @xcite , 60 years ago .    along the article we use the following notational conventions",
    ": let @xmath10 be a graph .",
    "* given a set of vertices @xmath22 , the set of edges with one endvertex in @xmath23 and the other one in @xmath24 , known as the * edge - cut * induced by @xmath23 , is denoted here by @xmath25 .",
    "* a * bridge * is an edge - cut which consists of a single edge .",
    "a graph with no bridge is * bridgeless*. * when @xmath12 is an orientation of @xmath1 , @xmath25 is partitioned into @xmath26 consisting of the edges directed from @xmath23 to @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , the set of edges directed from @xmath27 to @xmath23 .",
    "a * bisection * of a cubic graph @xmath10 is a partition of its vertex set @xmath29 into two disjoint subsets @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the same cardinality @xmath30 .    for reasons clarified in the sequel",
    "we also define :    let @xmath31 be an integer .",
    "a bisection @xmath32 of a cubic graph @xmath10 is a * @xmath0-weak bisection * if every connected component of each of the two subgraphs of @xmath1 , induced by @xmath2 and by @xmath3 is a tree on at most @xmath6 vertices .",
    "such a component is referred to in the sequel as * monochromatic*.    let @xmath12 be an orientation of a graph @xmath10 and let @xmath13 be an @xmath7-cnzf in @xmath12 .",
    "then for any @xmath33 , both @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are non - empty .",
    "if @xmath1 is cubic then @xmath29 is partitioned into two sets @xmath36 , where @xmath4 consists of all vertices of out - degree @xmath37 in @xmath12 . that partition is clearly a bisection .",
    "furthermore , assume that there is a monochromatic path @xmath38 in @xmath2 .",
    "counting the relevant ingoing and outgoing edges reveals @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and then it follows from the definition of an @xmath7-cnzf that @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath2 contains a monochromatic cycle , then all the edges with exactly one endpoint in this cycle are directed toward the cycle in @xmath12 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath12 has an @xmath7-cnzf ( regardless of the value of @xmath7 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath2 can be replaced here by @xmath3 .",
    "hence , we have shown that any cubic graph @xmath1 with @xmath42 has a 4-weak bisection .",
    "the same degree counting arguments leads to the following general observation , explicitly stated and proved ( for integer values of @xmath7 ) in @xcite :    [ local ] if a cubic graph @xmath1 admits an @xmath7-cnzf then there exists a @xmath43-weak bisection of @xmath1 ( @xmath44 is the largest integer , smaller or equal to @xmath7 ) .    also stated and proved in @xcite and @xcite is the following stronger theorem , which fully characterizes cubic graphs ( an instance of a more general statement which refers to all graphs ) which admit @xmath7-cnzfs , in terms of bisections :    [ rb ] let @xmath45 be a real number . a cubic graph",
    "@xmath10 admits an @xmath7-cnzf if and only if there exists a bisection @xmath32 of @xmath1 , such that for every set of vertices @xmath46 , @xmath47    the `` only if '' part of theorem  [ rb ] is proved by applying the same counting argument as above to all subsets @xmath23 of @xmath29 , while the proof of proposition  [ local ] only considers the subsets @xmath23 of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the `` if '' part also requires some basic flow network theory .",
    "we refer to a bisection which satisfies the condition of theorem [ rb ] as an * @xmath7-strong bisection * of @xmath1 .",
    "note that an @xmath7-strong bisection is clearly also a @xmath43-weak bisection .    by definition ,",
    "a cubic graph @xmath1 admits a @xmath48-weak bisection if and only if it is bipartite , in which case that bisection @xmath32 consists of the two `` sides '' of the bipartition of @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath32 in that case is also a @xmath48-strong bisection .",
    "proposition [ local ] hence implies that the circular flow number @xmath19 of a cubic graph @xmath1 is never strictly between 3 and 4 .",
    "it had been suggested by amir ban and nati linial @xcite that every cubic graph other than the petersen graph , admits a 4-weak bisection ( where every monochromatic component is either an isolated vertex or a single edge ) .",
    "however , we later found an infinite family of counterexamples to that statement .",
    "these examples , hereby presented , are also quoted in @xcite .",
    "a frequently used module in our construction is the graph @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) depicted in figure  [ fig : lk ] .",
    "note that @xmath51 is obtained from @xmath52 by the removal of one edge .    ]",
    "we say that a 2-coloring of the vertices of a graph ( not necessarily cubic ) is * balanced * if the two color classes are of the same size .",
    "[ lem : lk ] for any @xmath50 , any @xmath53-coloring of @xmath49 with no monochromatic component on more than 2 vertices is balanced and the two vertices of degree 2 are of distinct colors .",
    "we prove the result by induction on @xmath0 .",
    "the two vertices of degree 2 are denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 . when referring to the color of a vertex we relate to any given @xmath53-coloring of @xmath49 with no monochromatic component of size 3 or more .",
    "assume first that @xmath56 .",
    "if two adjacent vertices have the same color , say 1 , then all four remaining vertices have to be colored 2 and some vertex colored 2 has two neighbors colored 2 as well , which is a contradiction .",
    "it follows that without loss of generality the two neighbors of @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) are colored 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) . as a consequence , @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "are colored 1 and 2 , respectively and the coloring is indeed balanced .    if @xmath57 , then by removing @xmath54 and @xmath55 we obtain @xmath58 . by the induction hypothesis ,",
    "the coloring of the copy of @xmath58 is balanced and the two vertices of degree 2 of the copy of @xmath58 have distinct colors .",
    "it follows that if @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the same color , then one of them has the same color as its two neighbors , which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 and @xmath55 have distinct colors , and the coloring is balanced .    for any @xmath50 ,",
    "let @xmath59 be the graph obtained from @xmath49 by adding a vertex adjacent to the two vertices of degree 2 of @xmath49 , and let @xmath60 be the graph obtained by taking one copy of @xmath59 and two copies of @xmath61 and adding a new vertex adjacent to the three vertices of degree 2 ( see figure  [ fig : counterexample ] ) .",
    "[ p : counter ] for any @xmath50 , the graph @xmath60 has no 4-weak bisection .    let @xmath18 be the vertex whose neighbors are the vertices of degree two in the copies of @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "consider an arbitrary 4-weak bisection of @xmath60 .",
    "note that by lemma  [ lem : lk ] , the corresponding 2-colorings of the copies of @xmath49 and @xmath51 are balanced , and the color of @xmath18 has to be distinct from the colors of its three neighbors .",
    "therefore , the sizes of the two color classes differ by 2 .    the two copies of @xmath51 can clearly be replaced by one copy of @xmath62 and one of @xmath63 , for any @xmath64 .",
    ", an infinite family of cubic graph with no 4-weak bisections , width=264 ]    it so happens that each of our counterexamples contains a * bridge*. furthermore , all these examples lack a perfect matching , and , as far as we can tell , that may be true for every counterexample .",
    "we therefore rephrase ban and linial s idea as follows :    [ conj : mod - banlin ] the petersen graph is the only cubic graph which admits a perfect matching , but no @xmath65-weak bisection .    a slightly weaker version of conjecture [ conj : mod - banlin ] , referring to * bridgeless",
    "* cubic graphs ( which do admit perfect matchings @xcite ) is included in @xcite .    as a result of proposition [ local ]",
    ", every cubic graph @xmath1 with @xmath66 admits a @xmath65-weak bisection .",
    "accordingly , a counterexample for conjecture [ conj : mod - banlin ] should be looked for among cubic graphs @xmath1 with @xmath67 . when restricted to bridgeless graphs ,",
    "there are several known simple schemas to recursively construct infinitely many cubic graphs , 2- and 3-connected , with circular flow number 5 , from smaller ones .",
    "we checked several such graphs , obtained from the petersen graph , and found them to admit @xmath65-weak bisections , but we can offer nothing in the direction of a general proof .",
    "we recently @xcite developed an arsenal of construction methods which yield a rich variety of * snarks * ( cyclically 4-edge - connected cubic graphs of girth at least 5 which admit no 4-cnzf ) @xmath1 with @xmath68 . conjecture [ conj : mod - banlin ] , as well as its restriction to bridgeless cubic graphs , seems , at least for now , far beyond our reach .",
    "the vertices of any cubic graph can be partitioned into two color classes with no monochromatic component on more than two vertices , by repeatedly switching the color of a vertex which shares its color with more than one of its three neighbors .",
    "the resulting partition is not always a bisection , as @xmath30 is not guaranteed .",
    "however , the petersen graph as well as @xmath60 for every @xmath69 admit such a partition where @xmath70 .",
    "this observation leads to the following :    [ conj : con3 ] the vertex set of any cubic graph can be partitioned into two color classes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , satisfying @xmath71 , such that each monochromatic component contains at most two vertices .    unlike nowhere - zero flows and @xmath7-strong bisections",
    ", the existence of @xmath0-weak bisections is not restricted to bridgeless graphs .",
    "hence , the existence of a @xmath72-weak bisection in every cubic graph can not be directly deduced from seymour s 6-flow theorem @xcite .",
    "a stronger result however holds , as we prove in the following section .",
    "as noted in the previous section , a @xmath0-weak bisection can be considered as a relaxed local variant of @xmath0-nzf , at least when referring to @xmath53-connected cubic graphs .",
    "when comparing our results to what is known about strong bisections ( @xmath0-nzf s ) , we get the flavor of `` one step down '' : tutte s @xmath73-flow conjecture asserts the existence of a @xmath73-strong bisection for every @xmath53-connected cubic graph . in conjecture",
    "[ conj : mod - banlin ] ( with the exception of the petersen graph ) , @xmath73-strong bisections are replaced by @xmath65-weak bisections . with the following theorem , not only",
    "we replace `` @xmath72-strong bisections '' in seymour s @xmath72-flow theorem ( when stated , without any loss of generality , for cubic graphs ) , by `` @xmath73-weak bisections '' , but we also manage to do so for all cubic graphs , not necessarily bridgeless .",
    "theorem [ th : main ] can be viewed as a * local * @xmath73-flow theorem ( although its restriction to bridgeless graphs happens to be the easier case ) .",
    "a * valid factor * @xmath74 of a graph @xmath1 is a spanning subgraph of @xmath1 , where every connected component is either a cycle , or a path , with the property that an odd ( number of vertices ) path of @xmath74 is not an isolated vertex and its two endpoints are non - adjacent in @xmath1 .",
