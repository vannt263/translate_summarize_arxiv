    "mergers are fundamental to the cold dark matter paradigm of structure formation .",
    "they not only drive mass evolution by merging smaller dark matter haloes into larger ones , but they also change the morphology of galaxies from late to early - type , and drive gas to the centre of the merger remnant that triggers star formation @xcite and agn activity @xcite .",
    "early structural studies of elliptical galaxies by @xcite already hinted at the mass - dependent importance of dissipation during their formation . in a first systematic study of the morphology of merging pairs in a cdm galaxy formation model",
    ", @xcite could show that massive elliptical galaxies are mainly formed from dry mergers of early - type galaxies , while less massive ones show mixed mergers between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy .",
    "only elliptical galaxies well below @xmath9 are predominantly formed by wet mergers from two spiral galaxies .",
    "subsequent work on the role of dry mergers revealed that they can explain the formation of slow rotating boxy ellipticals @xcite , that they lie on the fundamental plane @xcite , follow the @xmath10-relation @xcite and that they could possibly explain the formation of a stellar density core in the centre of the remnant due to a binary black hole merger @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the strong size evolution of massive early - type galaxies provides evidence for dry merging @xcite . in an attempt to model the size - evolution of early - type galaxies",
    ", @xcite showed that the amount of dissipation during mergers can account for the observed size evolution . in their model , dry mergers result in remnants with larger sizes than remnants from gaseous mergers of the same mass .",
    "similar results have been reported from numerical simulations of mergers with varying degrees of gas fractions by @xcite .",
    "the natural question that immediately arises is , what is the reason for dry merging ?",
    "the early seminal work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite predicts the existence of a characteristic mass scale , below which the cooling time @xmath11 of a collapsing gas cloud is shorter than its dynamical time @xmath12 , allowing for efficient collapse on a dynamical time scale and subsequent star formation . in massive dark matter halos with @xmath13",
    "m@xmath5 , one generally finds @xmath14 and that shock heating of the collapsing gas supports the formation of a hot , static atmosphere at the halo virial temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from an observational point of view , the existence of a bimodality in the properties of the galaxy population , occurring at a mass scale of m@xmath15 m@xmath5 @xcite , lends support to the notion of a transition in the mode of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "hence one expects that dry merging will occur when cooling is sufficiently hindered at masses above a transition mass scale and if the reservoir of cold gas in the galaxy is used up by star formation before the merger happens .",
    "the existence of a characteristic shut - off mass scale in galaxy formation seemingly provides a simple way to truncate star formation within galaxy formation models .",
    "such an ad - hoc prescription has been used in earlier work by @xcite with the aim of avoiding too massive and too blue galaxies in clusters , and more recently in work by @xcite .",
    "these latter authors assume a shut - down of star formation in halos of mass @xmath16 m@xmath5 at @xmath17 , and show that the colour bimodality and luminosity function can be reproduced accurately in their model .",
    "the choice of @xmath18 m@xmath5 draws its support from two main arguments laid out in @xcite .",
    "one is that at this mass scale , stable shocks appear that allow for shock heating of gas @xcite .",
    "the second argument , more important , is that this shock - heated gas is generally so dilute and vulnerable to feedback that it literally stays hot forever and does not cool down to subsequently fuel star formation . while the first argument draws support from various simulations ( e.g.",
    "* ) , the second argument is less clear .",
    "one main uncertainty is with regards to the heating source of the hot gas .",
    "several plausible candidates are suggested in the literature such as agn - feedback , dynamical friction heating @xcite , or heating by gravitational potential energy @xcite .",
    "neither the relative contribution nor the overall magnitudes with which these processes heat the hot gas are theoretically certain or observationally confirmed to date .",
    "the aim of this letter is twofold .",
    "firstly , we predict the dry merger rate and its evolution by adopting a shut - off mass scale , and secondly , we use these results to propose observational strategies on how to test the existence of a critical mass scale for the quenching of star formation , that relies on the continued merging activity within cdm - cosmologies and is independent to first order on the underlying baryonic physics involved in the quenching process .    , @xmath19 m@xmath5 , @xmath20 m@xmath5 and @xmath21 m@xmath5 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath22 m@xmath5 show similar fractions of dry mergers at @xmath8 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we use semi - analytical modeling ( sam ) of galaxy formation to investigate the effect of the shut - off mass scale for cooling on the galaxy population .",
    "the dark matter history is calculated using the merger tree proposed by @xcite with a mass resolution of @xmath23 .",
    "the baryonic physics within these dark matter haloes is calculated following recipes presented in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , including a model for the reionizing background by @xcite . in our simulation",
    ", we assume that elliptical galaxies form whenever a major merger ( @xmath24 with @xmath25 ) takes place .",
    "we assume that during this process , all the cold gas in the progenitor discs will be consumed in a central starburst , adding to the spheroid mass , and that all stars in the progenitor discs will contribute to the spheroid as well .",
    "furthermore , we also add the stars of satellite galaxies involved in minor mergers to the spheroid .",
    "the merger time scale for galaxies is calculated using the dynamical friction prescription in @xcite and we find that the predicted merger rate is in good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "for more modeling details , we refer the reader to @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ks ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the following set of cosmological parameters derived from a combination of the 5-year wmap data with type ia supernovae and measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in the following",
    "we will modify our fiducial model as laid out in sk by adopting a quenching of cooling in dark matter haloes above a critical mass scale of @xmath31 m@xmath5 at @xmath17 as suggested in @xcite .",
    "note that we allow the gas that is already in the disc to continue forming stars until it is used up , even after the host halo crossed @xmath32 . in the following ,",
    "we define as dry mergers , objects for which m@xmath33m@xmath34m@xmath35 , with m@xmath36 as the total amount of cold gas in both progenitor discs , and m@xmath37 as the total amount of stars in both progenitors , respectively . whenever we refer to dry mergers in the following we will mean , dry major mergers with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "one of the main features of a shut - off mass scale @xmath32 is its influence on the evolution of massive galaxies that live in halos above @xmath32 . in a first implementation @xcite",
    "could show that they were able to reproduce the high mass tail of the luminosity function @xcite and hence prevent the common problem of overproducing too massive galaxies within sams .",
    "while the low - mass tail of the luminosity function becomes steeper with redshift @xcite independent of a shut - off , the high - mass tail of the luminosity function shows a much weaker evolution with time in models with shut - off , due to merging being the sole mode of growth compared to merging and star formation in our fiducial model without shut - off . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the fraction of massive galaxies that grew by dry major mergers within the last gyr .",
    "in general the contribution from dry mergers decreases at @xmath38 as galaxies of the same mass tend to live in smaller dark matter haloes that fall below @xmath32 . at redshifts",
    "@xmath39 , we find that in the mass range where dry mergers are significant , i.e. @xmath40 m@xmath5 , the fraction of galaxies that where formed by a dry merger within the last gyr is between @xmath41 at @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 independent of the galaxy mass .",
    "one critical point is the frequency of dry mergers in the universe .",
    "observationally , there is still a vigorous debate going on as to whether dry mergers do not play any role @xcite , a mild role @xcite , or an important role @xcite in the growth of the most massive galaxies .",
    "the strategies to determine the influence of dry merging remain mostly centered on the evolution of the luminosity function and the colour bimodality of galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the cumulative co - moving number density of dry major mergers as a function of galaxy mass in units of mpc@xmath1 .",
    "we calculated this number density by counting all dry major mergers that occurred within the cited redshift intervals .",
    "the contribution to dry mergers comes mainly from galaxies around @xmath6 .",
    "galaxies more massive than @xmath6 do not contribute significantly .",
    "the number densities increase by a factor of @xmath45 from @xmath42 to @xmath46 for galaxies more massive than @xmath6 .",
    "we also show results for a model without shut - off mass scale in the same figure .",
    "the dry merger rates we find in this model are almost a factor 5 lower compared to the shut - off model .        to further quantify the evolution of massive galaxies in terms of dry mergers , we show the corresponding merger rates and fractions for galaxies more massive than @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] & [ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "we measure the dry major merger rate in our model by counting all dry mergers that occurred in our simulation volume within the last 1.0 gyr of galaxies that are more massive than @xmath6 .",
    "this gives the merger rate @xmath47 in units of gyr@xmath2 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "the merger fraction @xmath48 is then calculated by simply dividing @xmath47 by the number density of galaxies more massive than @xmath6 at @xmath49 . to make a consistent comparison to earlier observational work of @xcite , we calculate the fraction of dry mergers at @xmath50 by counting all dry mergers that galaxies with @xmath51m@xmath5 in the last 150 myr experienced and dividing it by the number density of elliptical galaxies with @xmath51m@xmath5 .",
    "we define here and in the following elliptical galaxies as galaxies with bulge - to - total mass ratios of @xmath52 . for our comparison",
    "we only consider dry mergers between early - type galaxies and mixed mergers .",
    "it is likely that latter are contaminating the observed sample of @xcite and we find that in general more than half of all dry mergers are morphologically mixed mergers . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the model output agrees well with the observations .",
    "furthermore , we find an almost constant dry merger rate at @xmath8 with @xmath0 gyr@xmath2 mpc@xmath1 which shows a weaker decline to lower redshifts than the wet merger rate .    .",
    "the filled star and square are the modeled and observed dry merger fraction , respectively , for a sample of early - type galaxies as defined in @xcite . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the dry merger rate in general declines strongly at @xmath38 and is two orders of magnitude smaller than wet mergers at @xmath53 .",
    "we continue by splitting up the sample of dry mergers based on the morphologies of the merging galaxies . here",
    "we define galaxies with bulge - to - total stellar mass greater than 0.6 as ellipticals and all other galaxies as spirals .",
    "the relative contribution of different types of dry mergers to the merger fraction and rate is roughly constant throughout time . the main channels of dry mergers are between two elliptical galaxies or an ellitpical and a spiral galaxy .",
    "dry mergers between spirals play almost no role and are a factor of 5 less frequent .",
    "the model predicts a large fraction of mixed mergers between a spiral and an elliptical galaxy .",
    "these are prime targets for the detection of dry mergers by tidal features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an earlier study @xcite(k07 ) investigated the morphology of dry merger progenitors in their sam , finding that the majority is between two late - type galaxies in contrast to our results .",
    "there are two main reasons for this discrepancy between our models . while k07 use n - body simulations to follow the merging history of their model galaxies we apply the dynamical friction estimate to calculate the time it takes galaxies to merge once their haloes merge .",
    "it has been argued by e.g. k07 , that this time scale is shorter than the actual merging time scale and hence would overproduce mergers .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the merger rate estimates based on the dynamical friction time scale in various sams or halo occupation models are in good agreement with the observations of the merger rate by @xcite .",
    "in contrast merger rates from sams based on n - body simulations following sub - haloes show systematic lower merger rates than the observations ( hopkins et al , in prep ) .",
    "main problems in the sub - halo scheme for merging are too effective stripping of dark matter from the sub - haloes due to missing baryons and hence too long merging time scales , as well as calculating the merging time scale of the satellite galaxy once its hosting sub - halo has fallen below the halo resolution limit ( hopkins et al , in prep . ) . at this point",
    "it is still open which of the two schemes gives the more physical robust results .",
    "the second main reason for the differences between k07 and our results is the star formation efficiency .",
    "while we use a constant efficiency based on the local schmidt - kennicutt relation @xcite they use an efficiency that scales proportional to @xmath54 for constant gas masses . as a consequence star formation for massive galaxies , which predominantly live in the most massive haloes ,",
    "will be more efficient leaving them devoid of gas , but with massive stellar discs in their model . as seen in fig .",
    "10 of @xcite their colour - magnitude relation shows an excess of very luminous blue galaxies , most likely associated with late - type galaxies , that subsequently take part in mergers .",
    "it should be noted however , that simulations of dry late - type mergers in general do not reproduce the kinematics and surface profiles of the most massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the error bars show poisson error bars * inset graph : number density of all mergers ( solid line ) and of only wet mergers as a function of remnant mass within the same redshift interval .",
    "the black vertical dashed line indicates @xmath55 , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in the last section , we argued that it is not straightforward to measure the dry merger rate from the evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "we here want to propose a novel approach that is observationally well accessible . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the ratio of 1:1 mergers to 1:2 mergers and 1:3 mergers as a function of remnant galaxy mass . here",
    "we count the number of mergers , dry and wet , with different mass ratios that occurred within the redshift interval @xmath56 .",
    "galaxies with masses below @xmath57 do not show any strong variation in their relative merger rates . only on going to more massive galaxies does the relative contribution from different mass ratios start to change .",
    "the variation in the merger rate is most pronounced at a mass scale of @xmath6 , where equal mass mergers dominate the overall merger rate .",
    "galaxies participating in these mergers generally live in halos with masses that are above @xmath32 .",
    "the sudden increase in equal mass mergers is a direct consequence of the shut - off mass scale @xmath32 .",
    "galaxies that just reached @xmath6 do not grow by star formation anymore : their main channel of growth is mergers .",
    "what happens is that galaxies grow until they reach @xmath6 and then stall until they merge with another galaxy of similar mass .",
    "once galaxies passed @xmath6 the relative fractions of equal and unequal mass mergers approach the values below @xmath6 .",
    "another signature of the shut - off mass scale is imprinted in the overall number of dry and wet mergers as a function of galaxy mass ( see inset graph of fig . [ fig5 ] ) . at @xmath6",
    "the number density of dry mergers gets enhanced because of galaxies growing till they reach @xmath6 and then waiting to merge .",
    "the contribution of wet mergers towards the number density of all mergers drops very steeply at masses larger @xmath6 and allows us to clearly separate the dry merger activity region .",
    "we find a peak in the number density of mergers around @xmath6 , which is around the same scale reported in a study of pair counts by @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we predicted properties of dry mergers in a model that assumes a critical shut - off mass scale for cooling of gas . the impact on the galaxy population and the merger rates can be summarized as follows . the high - mass end of the luminosity function is dominated by continued dry mergers . at any redshift @xmath8 , @xmath58 of massive galaxies have had experienced a dry merger within their last gyr .",
    "we find a dry merger rate of @xmath0 gyr@xmath2 mpc@xmath1 and that the number density of dry major mergers is significantly increased with respect to a model without shut - off mass scales .",
    "the relative fraction of equal mass mergers is enhanced with respect to unequal mass mergers at @xmath59 m@xmath5 which marks the transition of galaxies from being predominantly formed in gaseous mergers or through star formation in discs to dry mergers . in a model where the transition between star forming and non - star forming galaxies is regulated by a physical process that does not result in a sharp shut - off mass scale",
    ", the relative rates of equal to unequal mass mergers do not show a significant change with mass ( e.g. k07 ) . around the same mass scale , the merger rate is enhanced with respect to the general trend of a decreasing merger rate with mass consistent with recent observations by @xcite . all of these features can be explained by considering that galaxies grow through star formation in discs only until their host halos reach @xmath32 and their supply of fuel in the form of cold gas stops . at this mass scale , efficient shock heating kicks in , as well as the gas becoming prone to efficient heating from various feedback sources @xcite .",
    "galaxies on average have masses of @xmath6 when this is the case , and can only grow to become more massive by mergers . as a result the relation between central galaxy stellar mass and host dark mater halo mass will become shallower , resulting in unequal mass dark halo mergers resulting in similar mass galaxy mergers ( see also hopkins et al . in prep ) .",
    "the results presented here can be used to test the existence of a shut - off mass scale ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent study based on galaxy group catalogue , arguing that this mass scale must be larger than @xmath60 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "if indeed various physical processes conspire to generate a characteristic mass scale , it should leave its fingerprint in the equal mass merger rate .",
    "using systematic surveys of galaxies to count pair statistics one can measure the relative fraction of equal to unequal mass mergers and look for a change as a function of mass .",
    "this approach is rather insensitive to difficulties with observing changes in luminosity functions , morphologies of galaxies or signs of interactions , and therefore should be able to provide robust results even at larger redshifts . + we would like to thank the referee for his valuable comments , as well as shardha jogee , gary mamon , michael brown and avishai dekel for helpful comments that improved the manuscript .",
