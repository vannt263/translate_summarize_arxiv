    "to control the occuracy of perturbative qcd predictions for physical observables it becomes important to have a regular way of estimating corrections suppressed by powers of large momentum scale , @xmath0 , and if not calculate explicitly the nonperturbative scale @xmath1 then find the leading exponent @xmath2 at least . at present , the understanding of power corrections has a solid theoretical status only for the special class of processes like @xmath3 and deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) for which the analysis based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) is applicable .",
    "the ope fixes the structure of power corrections ( as @xmath4 for the total cross - section of @xmath5 annihilation and @xmath6 for the structure functions of dis ) and allows to identify the corresponding scales @xmath1 as matrix elements of higher twist composite operators in qcd .",
    "the understanding of power corrections in the processes which do not admit the ope is the subject of intensive discussions ( see review  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an important example of the process , which does not admit the ope is the drell - yan ( dy ) process @xmath7 . here",
    ", the lepton pair with invariant mass @xmath8 is created in the partonic subprocess @xmath9 of annihilation of two quarks with invariant energy @xmath10 and we choose the kinematics such that @xmath11 .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that as @xmath12 , the final state in the partonic subprocess consists of the lepton pair with the energy @xmath13 accompanied by a soft gluon radiation with the total energy @xmath14 . due to the presence of two different scales",
    "the partonic cross - section gets large perturbative ( sudakov logs in @xmath15 ) and nonperturbative ( as inverse powers of @xmath16 ) corrections induced by soft gluons @xcite . calculating the moments @xmath17 at large @xmath18 and subtracting collinear divergences in the dis - scheme one",
    "can represent the leading term of the expansion of @xmath19 in powers of @xmath20 as _ n=_k _ s^k(q / n ) c_k(n ) + ( _ n / q)^p , where the coupling constant is defined at the characteristic soft gluon scale , @xmath21 contains the powers of sudakov logs plus finite , @xmath22 , contributions and the second term represents the leading power correction . as @xmath23 increases , the energy of soft gluons in the final state decreases as @xmath24 toward the infrared region in which perturbative expressions should fail .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the perturbative expansion in ( [ moment ] ) is not well - defined due to factorial growth of coefficients @xmath25 at higher orders in @xmath26 .",
    "this makes the perturbative series non borel summable and induces an ir renormalon ambiguity into perturbative contribution to ( [ moment ] ) at the level of power corrections , @xmath27 .",
    "then , ir renormalon ambiguity of perturbative expression is compensated in ( [ moment ] ) by ambiguity in the definition of the scale @xmath28 .",
    "thus , examing the large order behaviour of the perturbative series one can determine the level @xmath2 at which the leading power correction appear in ( [ moment ] ) .",
    "however , since it is impossible to calculate the coefficients @xmath21 exactly to higher orders in @xmath26 one has to find a reasonable approximation to @xmath21 which would allow to identify the @xmath29 factorial growth of the coefficients . to this end",
    "different schemes were proposed  @xcite .",
    "being applied to the drell - yan cross - section they predict that there are no @xmath30 corrections to ( [ moment ] ) and the leading renormalon contribution has the following form _ _",
    "n = 0(n / q ) + ( a _ n / q)^2 .",
    "we would like to stress that these schemes are _ approximate _ and although they were tested in the case of @xmath5 annihilation and dis , it is not clear yet whether they are applicable in the drell - yan process and whether they really predict the _ leading _ power correction to the cross - section .",
    "a different approach to the analysis of power corrections has been proposed in ref .",
    "it is based on the remarkable property of soft gluons that their contribution to the drell - yan cross - section can be factorized with a power occuracy into universal factor having the form of a wilson line .",
    "similar to the ope approach , the power corrections can be identified with the matrix elements of certain operators built from the wilson line .",
    "the wilson line operator appears in the drell - yan partonic subprocess as an eikonal phase of quarks interacting with soft gluon radiation .",
    "combining the eikonal phases of quark and antiquark together one gets the expression for partonic cross - section as @xmath31 where summation is performed over all possible final states consisting of an arbitrary number , @xmath32 , of soft gluons with the total energy @xmath33 and @xmath34 stands for time - ordering of gauge fields . here , @xmath35 is the eikonal phase of quark + antiquark and @xmath36 is the gauge field operator describing soft gluons .",
    "the contour @xmath37 in minkowski space - time corresponds to the classical trajectory of quark and antiquark .",
    "it goes from @xmath38 to the annihilation point @xmath39 along the quark momentum and then returns to @xmath38 in the direction opposite to the antiquark momentum . performing summation over final states in the last relation",
    "one can obtain the representation for the drell - yan cross section for @xmath12 as a fourier transformed wilson line expectation value  @xcite & = & 2_-^^-iy_0(1-)q/2 0| w(y_0 ) |0 + w(y_0 ) & & t u^_(0 ) t u_(y_0 ) , where @xmath40 is defined at the point @xmath41 . calculating the moments of this expression one",
    "obtains the following relation _",
    "n= 1n_c 0 | w(y_0 ) |0 , , which is valid up to corrections vanishing as @xmath42 and which takes into account all sudakov logs and power corrections in @xmath30 .",
    "the scale @xmath24 enters into ( [ rel ] ) just as a parameter of the integration contour in @xmath40 .",
    "eq.([rel ] ) states that the asymptotic expansion of the moments of the drell - yan cross section is related to the behaviour of the wilson line expectation value at small @xmath43 .",
    "perturbative expansion of ( [ rel ] ) involves standard `` short - distance '' logarithms @xmath44 , which are transformed into sudakov logs for @xmath45 .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath46 has a meaning of the maximal energy of soft gluons contributing to the partonic cross - section and after factorization of soft gluon emission it appears in ( [ w ] ) and ( [ rel ] ) as a _ ultraviolet _ renormalization scale of the wilson line operators . as a result ,",
    "all perturbative sudakov corrections to the drell - yan cross - section can be effectively resummed using the remarkable renormalization properties of wilson lines .",
    "they are summarized by the following rg equation = 2 _ cusp(_s ) ( n / q ) + _ ( _ s ) , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being some anomalous dimensions .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 from @xmath49 up to @xmath50 generates sudakov logs while the initial condition for @xmath19 at @xmath51 takes into account nonperturbative power corrections in @xmath30 . to understand their structure we perform the operator expansion of the wilson line @xmath52 in powers of @xmath53 = + y_0 +",
    "substituting this expansion into ( [ rel ] ) we find that the power corrections to the cross - section are described by matrix elements of the operators defined as derivatives of the wilson line  @xcite .",
    "although these operators are nonlocal in qcd , one can represent them as local operators in an effective nonabelian bloch - nordsieck theory in which wilson line appears as a result of integration over effective quark fields . solving the rg equation ( [ rg ] ) and using ( [ ope ] ) as a boundary condition",
    "we obtain that the leading power correction to the drell - yan cross - section appears as  @xcite _ n^power = n / q + ( n^2/q^2 ) , provided that there is no any hidden symmetry which would prohibit the appearence of the linear @xmath54 term in the expansion of the wilson line ( [ ope ] ) and would enforce the matrix element @xmath55 to vanish .",
    "one possibility to test the presence of the linear term in ( [ ope ] ) is to apply the ir renormalon approach and identify the source of linear terms inside perturbative series for the wilson line . at the leading order of renormalon calculus  @xcite",
    ", one can perform the explicit one - loop calculation of @xmath56 with a gluon mass @xmath57 and identify the power corrections as nonanalytical terms in the small @xmath58 expansion .",
    "one finds  @xcite that @xmath59 term is absent in agreement with the bloch - nordsieck cancellation , the linear term @xmath60 also vanishes and the leading term is @xmath61 .",
    "this means , that at the leading order the contribution of ir renormalons has the form ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "the same result can be obtained in the limit of large number of light quark flavours in which one performs 1-loop calculation of @xmath56 with the gluon propagator dressed by a chain of quark loops  @xcite .",
    "we notice that in both cases one calculates essentially abelian diagrams containing the color factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that the contribution of abelian diagrams to the wilson line exponentiates to higher orders in @xmath26 and one can generalize the above statement about the absence of linear @xmath54 term to a much larger class of abelian diagrams beyond the leading order of the renormalon calculus .",
    "however , the natural question rises whether the abelian diagrams provide a meaningful approximation to the exact expression for the wilson line or may be there is the leading contribution to @xmath52 coming only from nonabelian diagrams . to give an example where the second possibility is realized we mention the breakdown of the bloch - nordsieck cancellation of ir logs in the drell - yan cross - section at twist @xmath4 .",
    "the ir divergent part of the cross - section has the form  @xcite @xmath64 with @xmath65 being gluon ( quark ) casimir operators .",
    "it does not appear at order @xmath26 and at order @xmath66 it comes only from diagrams with nonabelian color structure .",
    "one might expect that similar phenomenon may happen when one considers linear in @xmath53 contributions to the wilson line beyond the leading order .",
    "the straighforward way to check this possibility would be to perform 2-loop calculation of the wilson line with a power occuracy in @xmath57 .",
    "however , even without going through this complicated calculation one can employ the operator methods of the qcd asymptotic dynamics  @xcite in order to analyse the properties of the matrix element = 1n_c , parameterizing the leading @xmath30 power correction to the drell - yan cross - section .",
    "the operator @xmath67 describes the eikonal phase of fast quark and antiquark annihilating at the space - time point @xmath53 and @xmath68ordering of gauge field operators @xmath69 is needed in ( [ w ] ) and ( [ dw ] ) to describe properly the possibility for quark and antiquark to exchange by a virtual soft gluon in the initial state . as a result , due to effects of the initial state interaction  @xcite",
    "@xmath70 this does not happen however for single - parton initiated process like dis and it is this phenomenon that makes different the properties of power corrections in dy and dis .",
    "indeed , if we omit the @xmath68ordering in ( [ dw ] ) then it is easy to show by direct calculation that the derivative @xmath71 is proportional to the generators of the @xmath72 group and it does not contribute to ( [ dw ] ) . to work out the effects of quark - antiquark correlations in @xmath56 one",
    "defines two gauge field operators @xmath73 and notices  @xcite that the field @xmath74 describes the coulomb gluons while the field @xmath75 is associated with radiative gluons forming quark and antiquark coherent states . since @xmath76=0 $ ] and @xmath77\\neq 0 $ ] , the expansion of the matrix element @xmath78 takes the following form  @xcite & & = [ ^i_c]^ij_ij + & & , where the flow of quark color is indicated explicitly . here",
    ", in the r.h.s .",
    "the first factor is the nonabelian unitary coulomb phase matrix and the eikonal phase @xmath79 depends only on commutative operators @xmath80 .",
    "the residual factor @xmath81 is unitary , @xmath82 , and it describes the correlations between coulomb and radiative gluons . the perturbative expansion of @xmath81 looks like  @xcite @xmath83 where effective nonlocal coupling @xmath84 resembles the fadin - kuraev - lipatov vertex .",
    "in abelian theory @xmath85 to all orders , but in qcd it gets _",
    "corrections starting from order @xmath86 in the strong coupling constant .    substituting ( [ v ] ) into ( [ dw ] )",
    "one observes that nonabelian coulomb phase is canceled .",
    "moreover , if we neglect @xmath87corrections to @xmath81 , then due to unitarity and commutativity of @xmath88 , the operator @xmath71 is again proportional to the @xmath72 generators and its matrix element vanishes identically in eq.([dw ] ) .",
    "thus , a nonzero contribution to ( [ dw ] ) comes only from higher order terms in @xmath81 .",
    "it immediately follows from the explicit form of @xmath81 that the corresponding feynman diagrams should have a nonabelian color structure and they arise starting from @xmath66 order .",
    "the set of relevant 2-loop feynman diagrams was identified in ref .",
    "this also explains why linear term did not appear in 1-loop calculation of the wilson line performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fact that the contribution of the residue factor @xmath81 to the wilson line @xmath52 is nonzero was demonstrated by a direct calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a small gluon mass @xmath57 was used as an ir cutoff and only logarithmic terms , @xmath89 , were kept .",
    "it was shown that the leading term @xmath90 of the expansion of the wilson line in eq.([ope ] ) gets a higher twist correction @xmath91 , which leads to the breakdown of bloch - nordsieck theorem for the drell - yan cross - section but is nevertheless consistent with the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem . to find the linear term in ( [ ope ] ) one has to perform the calculation of the same diagrams with a power accuracy in @xmath57 ,",
    "although interpretation of the linear term @xmath92 to order @xmath66 as a `` true '' power correction is not obvious .",
    "one may dress instead the gluon propagators by a single chain of quark loops , resum all 2-loop diagrams of order @xmath93 in the large @xmath94 limit and identify the contribution of the leading ir renormalon .",
    "we conclude that the effects of the initial state interaction , that is correlations between coulomb and radiative gluons , provide a new source of @xmath30 power corrections in the drell - yan process . in the wilson line approach",
    "they are described by the matrix element of the derivative of the wilson line operator in eq.([fin ] ) . in the ir renormalon analysis these effects could manifest themselves only in nonabelian feynman diagrams at higher orders in @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of @xmath30 corrections in the drell - yan cross - section is consistent with the kln theorem .",
    "summation over degenerate initial partonic states in ( [ w ] ) and ( [ rel ] ) leads to the expression for the kln cross - section , @xmath95 , where sum goes over an arbitrary number of incoming soft gluons . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial state interaction effects can be analysed in @xmath96 on the same footing as the final state effects thus resulting in the cancellation of @xmath30 corrections in @xmath96 .",
