    "the universal extra dimension model ( ued ) is one of the minimal possible extensions of the standard model ( sm ) with one or more compactified extra dimensions .",
    "the minimal model , henceforth called mued , was proposed by appelquist , cheng and dobrescu @xcite , and assumes that all sm fields can propagate in one compactified extra dimension @xmath4 . to get chiral fermions at the zero - th level",
    ", one needs an @xmath2 orbifolding , with two fixed points at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the compactification radius .",
    "all extra dimensional models are nonrenormalisable , and can at best be treated as an effective theory valid upto a cut - off scale @xmath8 .",
    "thus , mued has two free parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with which one can specify the spectrum at any @xmath1 level .",
    "( the masses of the excited scalars also depend on the sm higgs boson mass @xmath9 , so strictly speaking , that is also an input parameter . )",
    "one of the interesting feature of the mued model is the conservation of the kk number .",
    "this comes from the fact that all particles can propagate in the extra dimension and so the momentum along the fifth dimension must be conserved .",
    "however , presence of two fixed points breaks the translational symmetry along @xmath4 , so the kk number @xmath1 is no longer conserved . in principle , there may exist some interactions located only at these fixed points .",
    "if the interactions are symmetric under the exchange of the fixed points ( this is another @xmath10 symmetry , but not the @xmath10 of @xmath11 ) , the conservation of kk number breaks down to the conservation of kk parity , defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the kk number@xcite .",
    "the mued assumes the conservation of kk parity .",
    "kk parity does not allow single production of @xmath3 paricles and guarantees the stability of the lowest lying @xmath3 kk state ( lkp ) .",
    "the lkp , for most of the parameter space , is an excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson @xmath12 and is an excellent cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate @xcite .",
    "the mass of lkp is approximately @xmath13 and hence the overclosure of the universe puts an upper bound on @xmath14 gev @xcite .",
    "this guarantees the production of at least the @xmath3 excited states at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "while the spectrum for any @xmath1 is highly degenerate at the tree - level , the radiative corrections lift the degeneracy and provide interesting collider phenomenology @xcite .",
    "there are two types of corrections : the first one , which results just from the compactification of the extra dimension , called bulk correction , is in general small ( zero for fermions ) and is constant for all @xmath1 levels .",
    "the second one , called boundary correction , is comparatively large ( goes as @xmath15 ) , and plays the major role in determining the exact spectrum and possible decay modes . in the mued model",
    ", it is assumed that the boundary corrections vanish at @xmath16 , and so one can identify the cut - off scale @xmath8 with the regularization scale @xmath17 .",
    "the collider phenomenology of minimal ued has been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature of these studies is the existence of the lkp and hence the missing energy and missing transverse momentum signal at the colliders , which stems from the conservation of kk parity .",
    "however , it is possible to have fixed - point located interactions that are asymmetric in nature @xcite .",
    "this violates the kk parity , analogous to the r parity violation in supersymmetry .",
    "some phenomenology of such kk parity violation were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of kk parity violation with a ` partial ' universality ( by not allowing , or only partially allowing , the higgs boson to flow in the fifth dimension ) has also been discussed by @xcite .",
    "kk - parity violation , in the context of other extra dimensional models , has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the phenomenology of such a kk parity violating ( kkpv ) model where a fixed - point located asymmetric term is responsible for kkpv .",
    "unless the kkpv couplings are uninterestingly tiny , the lkp will decay within the lifetime of the universe and will not be a cdm candidate anymore . while this removes one of the main motivations of ued ,",
    "this also enlarges the parameter space by removing the upper bound coming from the cdm density . in other words",
    ", we plan to answer this question : _ if lhc does not find a kk excitation within the overclosure bound , which , taking into the possibility of a heavy sm higgs boson and the subsequent relaxation of the said bound , is about 1.4 tev @xcite , does it mean that the ued model is ruled out ? _ we will show that the answer is negative , and point out the major signals coming from such a model .",
    "a major spin - off of the model is the possibility to accommodate graviton states . in the conventional ued model with conservation of kk parity",
    ", gravitons can not be accommodated for @xmath18 gev @xcite as the model would allow an unacceptably large rate of @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the first excited graviton state ) which is ruled out from the cosmological diffuse photon flux . however , if kk parity is violated , the excited photons would decay to conventional fermion - antifermion pairs and not to gravitons , as the latter process is suppressed by the planck mass .",
    "thus , there are no dangerous gravitons in the model .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows .",
    "we first describe some of the basic features of ued model required for our analysis .",
    "readers familiar with the formalism of ued can directly go to section 3 , where the kk parity violation is introduced . in section 4",
    ", the nature and various decay modes of the erstwhile stable lkp , and also the nlkp ( next - to - lightest kk particle ) are discussed .",
    "we show the various possible combinations of lkp and nlkp depending on the model parameters . in section 5",
    ", we briefly touch upon the collider signatures of such modes at the lhc .",
    "finally section 6 summarizes the results and addresses the possible issues of this work .",
    "the model has been discussed in great detail in the literature . in this section",
    "we briefly mention some of the interesting features of ued required for our analysis .    *",
    "the tree level mass spectrum for any level @xmath1 is almost degenerate .",
    "the masses of these kk modes are given ( at tree level ) by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the corresponding sm particle .",
    "the tree level relation is modified when radiative corrections are taken into account@xcite .",
    "this causes significant splitting among the particle masses of any kk level and has important effects on collider phenomenology .",
    "the one loop corrected masses are determined by @xmath23 and @xmath17 , the cut off scale . in order to determine the excited scalar masses the sm higgs mass ( @xmath9 ) is also required . *",
    "all @xmath3 particles have to be pair produced and ultimately they must cascade down to the lowest lying @xmath3 particle ( lkp ) , due to the conservation of kk parity .",
    "however , as the mass splitting among the @xmath3 states is generally small ( being induced by radiative corrections ) , the final state will be soft leptons or jets associated with missing transverse momentum . while the missing energy is large , the missing @xmath24 is small , because the spectrum is still quasi - degenerate . * for most of the parameter space ( @xmath25 gev )",
    "the @xmath3 photon , which is almost the excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson @xmath12 due to the smallness of the ` weinberg angle ' for the @xmath26 levels , is the lkp .",
    "( if gravitons are included , they become the lkp and the model runs into trouble with the diffuse photon flux coming from @xmath27 , so we exclude gravitons ) . for higher values of @xmath23 and for high @xmath9 , @xmath28 ,",
    "the charged higgs boson excitation , becomes the lkp .",
    "this possibility can not be encouraged if lkp is stable and a prospective cdm candidate .",
    "* the corrections for kk modes with electroweak interactions are generally small .",
    "singlet or doublet leptons lie just above the @xmath29 .",
    "masses of the three excited scalars @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are also very close to the excited lepton masses ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a benchmark spectrum ) .",
    "however , the scalar masses depend on the sm higgs mass @xmath9 ; if we keep @xmath23 and @xmath17 fixed , for larger @xmath9 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 masses go down and @xmath30 becomes more massive .",
    "the charged scalar mass can even go below the @xmath29 mass @xcite . * the mass equation for the excited scalars may contain a universal boundary - located soft term @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this term is a free parameter of the theory and is taken to be zero in the mued model . for fixed @xmath9 ,",
    "all excited scalar masses increase with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "however , large negative values of @xmath35 again drives the @xmath28 to be the lkp ( this gives a lower limit on @xmath35 as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath17 and @xmath9 ) @xcite . *",
    "the @xmath3 fermions are vectorial and can be @xmath10-even ( left doublet and right singlet ) or @xmath10-odd ( left singlet and right doublet ) . these states are not exactly the mass eigenstates . in the doublet - singlet basis , we get a non - diagonal mass matrix , whose off - diagonal entries are the zeroth level mass @xmath22 .",
    "so the mass matrix is almost diagonal for all fermions , except for the third generation quarks , in particular for the top .",
    "after diagonalisation and a chiral rotation , one gets the proper mass eigenstates .",
    "in this section we study the effect of localised kinetic operators on the boundary .",
    "the possibility of such terms has been mentioned in @xcite .",
    "let us consider , as an illustrative example , the simplest possible one , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fermion kinetic term , which , located at @xmath36 , looks like @xmath37\\delta(y - y_0)~dy\\ , ,   \\label{int}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is any five dimensional fermionic field and @xmath39 is the coupling constant .",
    "the term is suppressed by the cutoff scale @xmath8 , which may be identified with @xmath17 .",
    "such a term contributes to the kinetic term of the kk fermion and hence changes its mass . to determine the spectrum , we have made several simplifying assumptions , without seriously compromising with the phenomenology .",
    "* the first assumption is to place such a term only at @xmath5 without losing any generality as the points @xmath5 and @xmath40 have already been chosen as the fixed points for the orbifold and the decomposition into even and odd modes are performed accordingly . for this case",
    ", only even modes will mix with each other . * to concentrate on the lhc - related phenomenology , let us consider the mixing between @xmath41 and @xmath3 states only . in principle , all @xmath1 states can mix with each other , but the admixture of the higher states in the low - lying physical states are suppressed by their masses . *",
    "we take the kk parity violating effects , parametrised by the dimensionless coupling @xmath42 to be small ( it should be perturbative for any meaningful calculation ) .",
    "in fact , we would take @xmath43 to be so small , @xmath44 , that effects on the spectrum that depends quadratically on @xmath43 can be neglected . in this limit ,",
    "it is enough to compute the tree - level corrections to the spectrum and neglect the loop effects .",
    "* we take @xmath39 and hence @xmath43 to be the same for all fermionic flavours .",
    "this is in conformity with lepton universality and suppression of tree - level fcncs . on the other hand , non - uniformity of @xmath39",
    "may be constrained from such low - energy observables , in analogy with the r - parity violating couplings of supersymmetry . *",
    "if @xmath43 is small , we can take the standard kk expansion of the fields as defined in @xcite . for large values of @xmath43 ,",
    "the expansion is most definitely not valid , but if we neglect terms @xmath45 and higher , one can use the standard perturbation theory with the @xmath46 limit as the unperturbed basis .",
    "we now integrate over @xmath4 and get the usual 4-d lagrangian .",
    "the kinetic part of the 4-d lagrangian in the ( @xmath41 , @xmath3 doublet , @xmath3 singlet ) basis is given by k_l",
    "i^_+ i2 k_r i^ _",
    "+ h.c , where k_l= ;   k_r= .",
    "note that the odd fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 do not mix with the @xmath41 fields . here",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are two symmetric matrices and they are diagonalised by two orthogonal matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". the eigenvalues of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we now rescale the kinetic terms by two normalisation matrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "after diagonalisation and rescaling , the kinetic terms take their canonical forms . in this intermediate basis , the kinetic terms are diagonal but the mass matrix is not ; rather , it is of the form m^ = n_l^-1 e_l^t m e_r n_r^-1 , where @xmath57 is the mass matrix in the kk basis : m= where @xmath22 is the @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ , sm fermion mass , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the radiative corrections on @xmath3 doublet and singlet fermions respectively .",
    "their expressions can be found in @xcite and do not change in the limit of small @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath60 is neither diagonal nor symmetric but can be diagonalised by a bi - unitary transformation of the form @xmath61 .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be obtained by diagonalising @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we can choose @xmath62 and @xmath63 in such a way that all elements of @xmath60 are positive .",
    "the transformation equations which connect original kk basis to the mass basis are given below = n_r^-1 u ;   = n_l^-1 v. the transformation is not unitary in nature as the normalisation matrices are themselves non - unitary .    once we obtain the physical states , the feynman rules can be computed from the lagrangian and the mixing matrix . however , for small @xmath43 so that @xmath45 terms can be neglected , the rules are particularly simple , _ e.g. _ , @xmath66\\,,\\nonumber\\\\     \\label{feynmanrules}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts refer to the dominant admixture at the @xmath3 level , and the superscripts to the kk numbers themselves .",
    "we have not shown the kkpv contributions to the kk - number conserving vertices ( _ e.g. _ , an @xmath41 gauge boson coupling to two @xmath3 fermions ) , as the standard gauge coupling is overwhelmingly dominant . by the same argument , kkpv decays of an @xmath3 @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or gluon to two @xmath41 fermions have not been shown .",
    "with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we study the spectrum by varying @xmath43 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that while this range does not depend on the precise value of @xmath23 , the low - energy constraints should depend upon @xmath74 and hence with large values of @xmath23 , most of these constraints could be successfully avoided .",
    "for such small values of @xmath43 , the branching fractions of kk allowed channels will be hardly affected ( except for a few cases that we will show later ) , since they are mostly driven by gauge or large yukawa couplings .",
    "however , the lkp will decay , and decay promptly within the detector unless @xmath43 is very tiny .",
    "the mixing angles between the kk basis and the mass basis depend upon @xmath23 and @xmath43 , and also indirectly on @xmath17 through @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "they also explicitly depend on @xmath22 , numerically important only for the top quark and the otherwise closely spaced levels .    the spectrum for @xmath75 gev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the horizontal lines , from top to bottom , stand for excited gluon @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( they are almost degenerate ) , and @xmath29 respectvely . as expected , the excited gauge boson masses are not affected .",
    "there are two quark states for each flavour ; they are the linear combinations of the singlet and the doublet fields",
    ". we shall call them @xmath78 ( dominantly singlet ) and @xmath79 ( dominantly doublet ) .",
    "_ for all fermions , the subscript refers to the su(2 ) gauge quantum number , not the kk number , but this should not create any confusion as we are interested in the phenomenology of only the @xmath3 level . _ the falling lines , from top to bottom ,",
    "correspond to @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 quarks and @xmath83 , @xmath84 leptons respectively .",
    "note that the fermion masses increase for negative @xmath43 and decrease for positive @xmath43 .",
    "for the quarks , the change is about 4% , but there is no level crossing , and hence the decay patterns remain identical .",
    "( the channel @xmath85 or @xmath86 opens up , where @xmath87 is a sm gauge boson , but the coupling is suppressed and the branching ratios are only minutely modified . )",
    "interesting thing happens for leptons , as their masses are close to the @xmath29 mass , and level crossing may take place . for example , for @xmath75 gev and @xmath88 , the dominantly singlet lepton @xmath84 can become the lkp and its mued decay channel to @xmath41 lepton and @xmath29 closes .",
    "the only possible channel for @xmath84 to decay is the kk parity violating one , to a lepton and an @xmath41 electroweak gauge boson .",
    "similarly , for @xmath89 the leptons may go above the @xmath3 scalars ( whose masses do not depend on @xmath43 ) and the scalar decay channels undergo a fundamental change , from two - body @xmath90 modes to three - body @xmath91 .",
    "if the lkp is no longer the dark matter candidate , it need not be a neutral one any more .",
    "also , depending on the parameters of the model , namely , @xmath23 , @xmath92 , @xmath9 , and @xmath43 , there are various possible nlkps ( we take , for simplicity , @xmath93 ) .",
    "the possibilities include @xmath84 and @xmath94 @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath95 ( the neutral cp - odd @xmath3 scalar ) .",
    "the lkp - nlkp phase diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] , drawn for @xmath96 , for two distinct cases : a light sm higgs boson ( @xmath97 gev ) and a heavy sm higgs boson ( @xmath98 gev ) .",
    "the salient features are as follows :    * case 1 * ( @xmath97 gev ) : in this case there are only two possible lkp candidates : @xmath29 ( regions 1 and 3 ) and @xmath84 ( region 2 ) . while the @xmath46 limit corresponds to the mued ( @xmath84 nlkp , region 1 ) , the transition to @xmath84 lkp can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . for sufficiently negative values of @xmath43",
    ", @xmath84 goes above @xmath28 , which then becomes nlkp ( region 3 ) .",
    "the parameter space does not allow @xmath99 as lkp .",
    "* case 2 * ( @xmath98 gev ) : for large @xmath9 , the situation becomes more complicated . the large quartic self - coupling drives the @xmath28 mass down and in region 2 , this becomes the lkp , while it is the usual @xmath29 lkp phase in region 1 . in region 1 , depending on the values of the model parameters , either @xmath84 or @xmath28 can be the nlkp , while in region 2 , either @xmath29 , @xmath95 , or @xmath84 is the nlkp .",
    "region 3 is the @xmath84 lkp region , with @xmath29 or @xmath28 as the nlkp .",
    "the phase diagram can be more complicated with excited gravitons or right - handed neutrinos , which we have not considered here .",
    "as was mentioned above , there are three possibilities for the lkp : @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath84 , depending on the parameter space .",
    "the kk parity violating interactions allow couplings of @xmath100 states with two sm particles .",
    "there is obviously no kk conserving decay modes for lkp .",
    "* case 1 * ( @xmath29 lkp ) : @xmath29 can decay to two sm fermions , @xmath101 , @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "the couplings are proportional to the corresponding hypercharges ; the quark channels are also enhanced by the colour factor .",
    "the phase space suppression is minimal unless @xmath29 is just above the @xmath104 threshold .",
    "the table shows the @xmath29 branching fractions for @xmath75 gev ( there is no kk conserving decay , so the widths do not depend on the value of @xmath43 ) .    .branching fractions of @xmath29 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we plot the variation of 4 - 7 leptons + missing energy cross section as a function of @xmath23 ( @xmath43 does not play any role here except forcing the decay of the lkp ) .",
    "the numerical cumputations were done with the calchep package @xcite , augmented by the implementation of ued .",
    "the branching fractions , multiplied by the respective production cross - sections , give the final signal cross - section and hence the event rate .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig : cross ] that the @xmath105 signal has the highest cross - section , closely followed by that of @xmath106 .",
    "the sm backgrounds are under comparative control .",
    "first , same - flavor unlike - sign dilepton invariant mass veto at @xmath107 removes the most important background ( @xmath108 is about 86 fb at the lhc ) .",
    "while the @xmath67-backgrounds , associated with neutrinos , can not be removed in this way , they are further suppressed by higher powers of @xmath109 .",
    "what may be problematic is to detect all the leptons coming from the excited states",
    ". some of them can be very soft , coming from decay between closely spaced levels , which will probably missed by the acceptance of the detector .",
    "however , they come from the kk - conserving decays at the first stage of the cascade .",
    "the kkpv decays produce hard leptons , which should be easily detectable . in short , one should be able to discriminate such a scenario from other competing new physics scenarios , as well as from the sm itself , from the event rate and topology of the multilepton final state .",
    "a detailed study is outside the scope of this paper and will be taken up later .    -10pt",
    "in this paper we have discussed the phenomenology of kk parity violation in the ued model through an asymmetrically fixed - point located term .",
    "this term removes the @xmath10 parity of @xmath110 and hence kk parity is violated .",
    "thus , the lightest @xmath3 particle , the lkp , is no longer stable and a cold dark matter candidate .",
    "this removes the overclosure bound and answers the question posed in the introduction , _ viz .",
    "_ , whether non - observation of ued signals at the lhc will invalidate this model , in the negative .",
    "this also allows the introduction of gravitons in the model even for comparatively low values of @xmath23 .",
    "the model that we have discussed is rather simplistic .",
    "the kkpv strength may be different for different flavors , and that may give rise to interesting flavor - changing constraints , but we have assumed the same @xmath43 for all fermions .",
    "we have also kept the coupling small so that the field expansion is valid and there is no single production of the excited states at the colliders .",
    "the removal of dark matter lkp opens up various possibilities in the lkp - nlkp phase diagram , which we have studied .",
    "this , in turn , corresponds to different types of signals in the colliders .",
    "depending on the strength of the coupling the lkp may decay inside or outside the detector .",
    "if it decays inside the detector , the multilepton final states should be useful to prove the validity of this model . for large values of the sm higgs boson mass and a small kk - parity violating coupling @xmath111 , @xmath28 , which becomes a long - lived lkp to decay outside the detector , leaves its characteristic charged track .",
