    "among the known leptons , the muon is potentially interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , its relatively long lifetime of 2.2 @xmath3s  @xmath4  makes it possible to perform precision measurements .",
    "second , it is sensitive to new sectors of heavy particles and new interactions . in this sense ,",
    "the muon anomaly has provided a stringent test for new theories of particle physics , since any new field or particle which couples to the muon must contribute to @xmath5 .",
    "the most recent results reported by the muon @xmath6 collaboration @xcite have triggered a renewal of interest on the theoretical prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( commonly referred to as the muon anomaly ) , @xmath7 , in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this experimental value is claimed  to show that there remains a discrepancy with the sm theoretical calculations at the confidence level of @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xcite@xcite , if the hadronic light - by - light contribution , @xmath10 , is used instead of @xmath11 , as a consequence that @xmath12 annihilation data are used to evaluate this contribution against hadronic @xmath13 decays data @xcite . among all contributions that yield corrections to the muon anomaly ,",
    "the hadronic contributions are less accurate , due to the hadronic vacuum polarization effects in the diagrams which use data inputs coming from the @xmath12 annihilation cross section and the hadronic @xmath14 decays .",
    "also it is not clear , at present , whether the value from @xmath14 decay data can be improved much further , due to the difficulty in evaluating more precisely the effect of isospin breaking @xcite .",
    "in fact , these measurements have provided the highest accuracy of the validity of the different theories for strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions because they have reached a fabulous relative precision of 0.5 parts per million ( ppm ) in the determination of @xmath5 . however ,",
    "if this confidence level for the muon anomaly remains , it is possible that we are under a window open for a new physics at a high energy scale , @xmath15 the study of the muon anomaly becomes relevant because it is more sensitive to interactions that are not predicted in the sm but will be possibly reached at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , with @xmath16 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "if we take into account the effects of virtual massive particles in the diagrams contributing to the lepton anomaly , the ratios between the corrections to the anomalies are of the order @xmath17 for the muon and electron , and of the order @xmath18 for the tau and electron .",
    "the same huge enhancement factor would also affect the contributions coming from degrees of freedom beyond the sm , so that the measurement of the @xmath14 anomaly would represent the best opportunity to detect new physics .",
    "unfortunately , the very short lifetime of the @xmath13- lepton which , precisely because of its high mass , can also decay into hadronic states , makes such a measurement impossible at present ; this is the reason why there is an emphasis on the muon anomaly .    in this case",
    ", it becomes interesting to estimate the order of the correction of @xmath5  in the context of theories beyond the sm .",
    "this is done in terms of powers of @xmath19 .",
    "this is related @xcite to the validity or the breaking of the chiral symmetry for leptons together with the  change of sign for @xmath20 .",
    "if this symmetry , which is referred to as weinberg symmetry ( ws ) , is respected , then @xmath21 ; on the other hand , if it is broken , @xmath22  .",
    "this is important because in the latter case the explanation of the muon anomaly may be given by a new physics at a relatively high energy , whereas in the former it should appear at a scale close to the electroweak ( ew ) one .",
