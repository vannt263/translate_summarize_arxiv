    "an _ iterated function system ( ifs ) _ on @xmath1 is a finite collection of strictly contractive self - maps @xmath2 . a classical result , formalized by hutchinson @xcite ( although the crucial idea goes back to moran @xcite ) , states that for every ifs there is a unique nonempty compact set @xmath3 for which @xmath4 when the mappings are similitudes ( or conformal ) and the pieces @xmath5 do not overlap much , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath6 is easily determined by the contraction ratios of the mappings @xmath7 , see for example @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we assume that the mappings @xmath7 are affine ; in this case the set @xmath6 is called a _ self - affine set_. in addition , we do not require any non - overlapping condition .",
    "dropping either the conformality or separation hypothesis makes the problem of estimating dimension dramatically more complicated .",
    "the main feature of our work is that we are able to drop both , while obtaining results which are valid everywhere , not just generically .",
    "the so - called singular value function plays a prominent rle in the study of the dimension of self - affine sets .",
    "following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.1 ) , the singular value function leads to a notion of the singular value dimension , which serves as an upper bound for the upper minkowski dimension , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "falconer @xcite ( see also @xcite ) proved that assuming the norms of the linear parts to be less than @xmath8 , this upper bound is sharp , and also equals the hausdorff dimension , for @xmath9-almost every choice of translation vectors . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the lebesgue measure on @xmath10 .",
    "falconer and miao @xcite have recently shown that the size of the set of exceptional translation vectors is small also in the sense of hausdorff dimension .",
    "the self - affine carpets of mcmullen @xcite show that one can not replace `` almost all '' by `` all '' , even if the pieces do not overlap .",
    "furthermore , it follows from examples in @xcite that the @xmath8 bound on the norms is essential .",
    "these counterexamples are of a very special kind , and it is therefore of interest to find families of self - affine sets for which one can loose these assumptions .",
    "a result into this direction was obtained by hueter and lalley in @xcite , where it is proven that for an explicit open class of self - affine sets , the hausdorff dimension is indeed given by the singular value dimension , as long as the pieces @xmath5 are disjoint . in their result the norms may be greater than @xmath8 , but it follows from their hypotheses that the singular value dimension is less than @xmath11 . in a different direction , it was recently proven in @xcite that for a randomized version of self - affine sets the natural analogue of falconer s formula holds almost surely regardless of the norms .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for other recent results on the dimensional properties of self - affine sets .    for a fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", the class of all ifss consisting of @xmath12 affine maps on @xmath1 inherits a natural topology from @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is identified with the vector space of all invertible affine mappings on @xmath1 .",
    "we will say that a family of affine ifs s is _ robust _ if it is open in this topology , and that a property is _ stable _ if the set of ifs s where it holds is robust .",
    "we define a class of self - affine sets in which we allow overlapping and the norms of all the maps can be arbitrarily close to @xmath11 ; see  [ sec : kakeya ] for the details .",
    "we show that in this class the minkowski dimension coincides with the singular value dimension ( theorem [ thm : main_result ] ) , and it can be defined dynamically as the zero of a certain pressure function . even though the family is not itself robust , in  [ sec : examples ] we will exhibit robust subsets which preserve all the interesting properties .",
    "this is the first instance where the equality of minkowski dimension and singular value dimension is established for a robust family , without requiring any separation assumptions .",
    "moreover , we prove that the minkowski dimension is a continuous function of the generating maps within this family .",
    "the inspiration for our work arose from the theory of kakeya sets .",
    "recall that a subset of @xmath1 is called a _",
    "kakeya set _",
    "( sometimes also a _ besicovitch set _ ) if it contains a unit segment in every direction .",
    "the long - standing kakeya conjecture asserts , in one of its many forms , that the hausdorff dimension of a kakeya set in @xmath1 is precisely @xmath13 .",
    "this is wide open for @xmath16 ; however , for @xmath17 it is known to be true , and indeed the proof is not difficult , see for example @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the overlap between segments pointing in different directions is small , in the sense that the dimension of the union of all segments is the same as if there was no overlap at all .",
    "we strove to construct a family of self - affine sets in which the cylinder sets are aligned in different directions , so that the possible overlaps between them would not affect the dimension calculations .",
    "although the technical details may obscure it somewhat , it may be useful to keep this basic idea in mind while going through the definitions and proofs .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : self - affine ] , we introduce some standard notation and present some preliminary facts on self - affine sets . the family of self - affine sets of kakeya type is defined in  [ sec : kakeya ] , where theorem [ thm : main_result ] , the main result of the paper , is stated .",
