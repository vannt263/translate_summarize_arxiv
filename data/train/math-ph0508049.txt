    "a droplet excitation is then a state with @xmath0 , @xmath3 , opposite spins that form , up to quantum fluctuations , a compact cluster which moves through the system as a unit .",
    "since the model also has kink and antikink ground states @xcite in which two halfs of the chain have opposite magnetization with a transition region in between , it is interesting to ask about droplet excitations with respect to such a ground state .",

    "the hamiltonians @xmath775 are periodic of period @xmath776 in the sense that there is a unitary phase multiplication , as in ( [ constraint ] ) , such that after conjugating by that @xmath775 and @xmath777 are equal . in particular",
    ", this means that the spectrum is @xmath776 periodic .",
    "moreover , if there is an eigenvector of @xmath775 , then multiplying this eigenvector by the necessary phase produces the relevant eigenvector for @xmath777 .",

    "the eigenvectors are norm continuous in @xmath268 , and are determined for all @xmath268 using this and periodicity .",
    "moreover , there is a constant @xmath781 such that there is a spectral gap above the ground state of @xmath775 of size at least @xmath782 , uniformly in @xmath268 .",
    "fixing @xmath0 and @xmath268 , there is obviously a spectral gap above the bound state for the ising model , @xmath87 .",

    "but the kernel @xmath783 , when thought of as a function of @xmath44 , varies in a way such that the associated operators are norm - continuous with respect to @xmath44 , on @xmath216 .",
    "( as used before in the paper , this can be proved by obtaining row and column sum bounds , which pertain to @xmath710 and @xmath711 , and then using riesz convexity . )",

    "but the bound states found in lemma [ lem : bethe ] vary continuously in @xmath44 , therefore , they must be the actual eigenstates .",
    "the argument of the proof is , to some extent , an analogue of yang and yang s argument from @xcite but starting from the ising model , not the xy model , and valid directly in the infinite volume limit .",
    "we would like to mention that more sophisticated and more powerful arguments of the yang , yang style were employed by goldbaum in @xcite to handle the more complex  but still bethe ansatz solvable hubbard model .    note that in the proposition above , one can not choose @xmath784 to be independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that in our @xmath710 , @xmath711 interpolation , the rowsums and columnsums do depend on @xmath0 because of the _ number of _ matrix entries . on the other hand , in @xcite two of the authors",

    "therefore , using that result and the present argument , one can obtain a single @xmath784 which works for all @xmath167 .",
    "note that not only are the energies for the bound states continuous in @xmath268 and @xmath44 , they are easily seen to be analytic .",

    "the arguments in @xcite prove that there is also a gap for large enough @xmath0 and small enough @xmath44 , and calculates the asymptotic form of the energy in the @xmath798 limit , with @xmath44 fixed .",
    "as is easily seen from our present analysis , in that limit the energy converges to @xmath799 . a simpler argument , but which is not robust to changes in @xmath4 , can follow the proof of proposition [ prop : smallq_infinite ] .",
    "namely , one can construct a kernel in each subspace of @xmath0 downspins and translation eigenvalue @xmath268 , and check that as a function of @xmath44 the kernel is continuous , and moreover it is uniformly continuous for @xmath106 $ ] . if one considers the sequence of operators for all @xmath4 ( acting on different hilbert spaces depending on @xmath4 ) one can even deduce that they are in some sense equicontinuous , because the stronger fact is true that the operators are lipschitz with lipschitz constants which are uniformly bounded in @xmath23 and @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "the important technique of kennedy , which follows the previous work @xcite , is to obtain a perturbation expansion which can be performed for all @xmath4 at once , therefore allowing comparison of different @xmath4 .",
