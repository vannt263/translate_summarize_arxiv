    "in the previous study , we introduced a stochastic aggregation process involving both active and passive clusters@xcite .",

    ", we apply stochastic aggregation to reaction - diffusion , coarsening , and ballistic agglomeration problems .",
    "our goal is to examine the range of validity the mean - field results , and to determine whether the overall scaling behavior extends to low dimensional systems .",
    "the rate equations approach is mean - field in nature , i.e. , it is valid only when spatial correlations are absent .",
    "formally , it is applicable only in infinite spatial dimension , or in the presence of an effective mixing mechanism .",
    "this mean - field theory should also be _ asymptotically _ exact when the spatial dimension is sufficiently high .",
    "in low spatial dimensions , however , significant spatial correlations eventually develop , and the rate equation approach does not apply in the long time limit .",
    "we therefore focus on one - dimensional systems where spatial correlations are most pronounced .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of stochastic aggregation processes with both diffusive and ballistic particle transport .",
    "the simulations show that the scaling behavior suggested by the mean - field theory is indeed generic , as it extends to one - dimensional systems .",
    "we find that two nontrivial model - dependent exponents characterize the survival probabilities of the particles and monomers , respectively .",
    "smoluchowski s theory provides reasonable estimates for these exponents .    additionally , we studied the limiting mass distribution of passive clusters .",
    "surprisingly , over a substantial mass range , this distribution depends only weakly on the underlying transport mechanism .",
    "furthermore , mean - field theory provides an excellent approximation for the limiting mass distribution .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the general scaling behavior is outlined in sec .",

    "a discussion of the results is presented in sec .",
    "stochastic aggregation involves two types of clusters : active and passive@xcite . initially , the system consists of active monomers only .",
    "when two active clusters merge , the newly - born aggregate remains active with probability @xmath0 , or becomes passive ( i.e. , it never aggregates again ) with probability @xmath1 . eventually , all active clusters are depleted and the system consists of passive clusters only .",
    "this process can be viewed as an aggregation - annihilation process since it interpolates between aggregation ( @xmath2 ) and annihilation ( @xmath3)@xcite .",
    "quantities of interest include @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the distributions of active and passive clusters at time @xmath6 , as well as the final distribution of passive clusters , @xmath7 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , two conservation laws underly this system .",
    "the first is mass conservation , @xmath8={\\rm const}$ ] .",
    "the second conservation law reflects the fact that changes in the overall densities are coupled , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number densities of active and passive clusters , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to study the time evolution of the number density and the mass density of active clusters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the latter quantity is the survival probability of an active particle , i.e. , the probability that it still belongs to an active cluster at time @xmath6 .",
    "smoluchowski s theory suggests that both quantities decay algebraically in the long time limit @xmath14 as will be shown below , this as well as other scaling properties suggested by this theory hold qualitatively even for low dimensional stochastic aggregation processes . while the decay exponent @xmath15 is typically robust in that it depends only on the major characteristics of the process such as the spatial dimension or the transport mechanism , the exponent @xmath16 is non - universal as it depends on the details of the model , i.e. , on the probability @xmath0 . in turn",
    ", this implies a non - universal growth law for the average mass of an active cluster @xmath17 .    for the system to follow a scaling behavior",
    ", the average mass must be the only relevant scale in the long time limit , and conversely , any scale characterizing the initial mass distribution must be `` erased '' eventually .",
    "in other words , the mass distribution is characterized by a single rescaled variable @xmath18 with the time dependent prefactor fixed by the decay laws ( [ rs ] ) .",
    "this scaling behavior is similar to that found for deterministic aggregation - annihilation processes@xcite and for aggregation - annihilation of domains in coarsening processes@xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that another independent exponent describes the decay of small clusters .",
    "specifically , the monomer density decays according to @xmath19 with a model - dependent exponent @xmath20 .",
    "the monomer density decay reflects the small argument behavior of the scaling function @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "one of our main results is that the mass distribution of active clusters is described by a set of nontrivial exponents @xmath23 .",
    "these exponents can be viewed as persistence exponents@xcite as they characterize the survival probability of an active particle , and an active monomer @xcite .",
    "several properties of the scaling exponents are general .",
    "for instance , the inequalities @xmath24 hold since @xmath25 .",
    "the two exponents are equal @xmath26 in the annihilation case ( @xmath3 ) , since @xmath27 . in the aggregation limit ( @xmath2 ) the mass density of active clusters is conserved and therefore @xmath28 .",
    "we now turn to the mass distribution of passive clusters .",
    "the smoluchowski theory suggests that the same scaling form underlies both mass distributions @xmath29 in contrast with the active cluster distribution , the passive cluster distribution approaches a nontrivial final distribution @xmath7 . such a _ time",
    "independent _ final distribution is consistent with the above scaling form only when the scaling function diverges , @xmath30 in the limit @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . as a result , the final mass distribution of passive clusters decays algebraically in the large mass limit @xmath33 at a given time @xmath6 , this decay is realized for clusters whose mass @xmath34 does not exceed the characteristic mass @xmath35 .",
    "note also that @xmath36 implies @xmath37 .",
    "generally , the mass conservation restricts the large mass decay exponent to @xmath38 .",
    "since the @xmath39 exponent varies between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we see that the entire range of acceptable exponents is realized by tuning the probability @xmath0 .",
    "it is well established that spatial correlations can be safely neglected only in spatial dimensions larger than some upper critical dimension , @xmath42@xcite .",
    "for example , for irreversible aggregation with mass - independent diffusion and reaction rates , one has @xmath43 ; for a general aggregation process , however , the upper critical dimension may be arbitrarily large@xcite .",
    "below the upper critical dimension , substantial spatial correlations develop , and the most important features including the scaling exponents and the scaling functions are changed .",
    "generally , the lower the spatial dimension , the larger the difference with the mean - field predictions .",
    "although the smoluchowski rate equations approach does not apply in low spatial dimensions , it can still serve as a useful approximation after an appropriate modification .",
    "this can be accomplished by replacing the overall reaction rate with an effective density - dependent reaction rate @xmath44 @xmath45 we are primarily interested in situations where aggregation is independent of the mass , and therefore we use a mass independent rate kernel .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath46 is model dependent . in reaction - diffusion processes",
    ", the reaction rate decays algebraically with the density ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath47 yields @xmath48 , and consequently , the density decay exponent is found @xmath49 in general , a reduction in the reaction rate , i.e. , @xmath50 , leads to a slowing down in the density decay rate , @xmath51 .",
    "apart from the change in @xmath15 , all other aspects of this approximation are identical to the smoluchowski theory with a constant rate kernel . indeed , the above rate equations reduce to the smoluchowski s rate equations with a redefined time variable , @xmath52 . in particular , the scaling exponents @xmath39 and @xmath53 are independent of @xmath54 : @xmath55 one can verify the expected limiting behaviors @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , the scaling functions are as in the constant kernel solution @xcite , and for example , @xmath58 is purely exponential .",
    "the corresponding small argument exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60 follow from @xmath39 and @xmath53 using the aforementioned scaling relations .",
    "the final mass distribution of passive clusters is independent of the reaction rate @xmath61 @xcite @xmath62    below , we compare these mean - field predictions with simulation results for one - dimensional stochastic aggregation where spatial correlations are most pronounced .",
    "we also examine the role of the aggregates transport mechanism by considering both diffusive and ballistic transport .",
    "in diffusive stochastic aggregation , identical particles are placed onto a @xmath63-dimensional lattice .",
    "all particles perform independent random walks , i.e. , they hop to a randomly chosen nearest - neighbor site with a constant rate .",
    "if this site is occupied , the two particles coalesce irreversibly , and with probability @xmath0 the resulting aggregate remains active , while with probability @xmath1 it becomes passive . effectively ,",
    "passive particles are removed from the system .    in the case of single - species reaction diffusion processes , the effective reaction rate can be obtained from dimensional analysis .",
    "( [ mft ] ) implies @xmath64=[l]^d[t]^{-1}$ ] , and since the reaction rate can only be a function of the diffusion coefficient @xmath65=[l]^2[t]^{-1}$ ] and the density @xmath66=[l]^{-d}$ ] , one finds @xmath67 .",
    "hence , @xmath68 and eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) yields the correct decay exponents @xmath69@xcite below the upper critical dimension @xmath43 .    to examine the above scaling picture we performed numerical simulations of diffusive stochastic aggregation processes in one dimension . unless noted otherwise , the data was obtained from an average over 10 independent realizations in a system of size @xmath70 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "initially , all sites were occupied .",
    "first , we verified that the number density , the mass density , and the monomer density indeed decay algebraically in the long time limit , in accord with eqs .",

    "furthermore , the predictions @xmath76 and @xmath77 provide a reasonable approximation .",

    "the exact exponents found for the disordered case by le doussal and monthus@xcite provide an excellent approximation ( within 0.1% ) for @xmath39 . in the case of @xmath53 ,",
    "a different behavior emerges in the aggregation limit , @xmath90 , where the exact value is @xmath91 @xcite , and the disagreement with both mean - field theory and the disordered case are most pronounced .     the exponent @xmath39 versus @xmath0 .",

    "for @xmath71 , one therefore expects @xmath95 ( compare with @xmath96 and @xmath97 , predicted by the disordered case and the mean - field theory ) .",
    "this corresponds to a very strong suppression of large masses , and therefore , it is much more difficult to confirm this behavior numerically . nevertheless , our simulations ( fig .  5 )",
    "are consistent with a power law decay with an exponent @xmath98 .    in one dimension , the diffusion - controlled stochastic aggregation is equivalent to the potts model with zero - temperature glauber dynamics@xcite . for the @xmath99-state potts model with",
    "spatially uncorrelated initial conditions , aggregation of domain walls occurs with probability @xmath100 , and annihilation occurs with probability @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the above can be reformulated in terms of domain walls rather than aggregates . in the coarsening context , the domain wall mass ( or number ) distribution is dual to domain number distribution @xcite .     the distribution @xmath5 versus @xmath34 for three different times @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the typical mass at these three times is proportional to @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively .",

    "we consider the momentum conserving case , also known as `` ballistic aggregation '' or `` sticky gas '' @xcite .",
    "the initial velocities are assigned according to the distribution @xmath105 .",

    ", we have shown that even in the absence of a consistent mean - field theory , some characteristics such as the exponent @xmath39 are well approximated by the rate equations .",
    "understanding of reaction processes with an underlying ballistic transport remains largely incomplete .",
