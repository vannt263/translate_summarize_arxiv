    "the outstanding problem in the theory of strong interactions is to understand how hadrons are built from quarks and gluons .",
    "the essential information on the internal structure of hadrons can be obtained from hard scattering processes . in such processes the duration of the interaction between a projectile and a fast moving",
    "hadron is small and the latter can be resolved into separate quarks and gluons ( partons ) .",
    "thus in hard scattering processes a hadron can be considered as a collection of non - interacting partons .",
    "this description of hadrons emerged from the study of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and evolved into what is nowadays known as the parton model of hadrons and found its fundamental justification in qcd .",
    "the key ingredient of the parton model are the parton densities which encode information on the distribution of partons with respect to longitudinal momentum .",
    "the recent trend in this field is to study processes which can provide additional information ( e.g. distribution of partons in the transverse plane , their angular momentum ) about the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "such information is encoded in so - called generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) which were introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite in the analysis of deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "the gpd formalism is rather universal and applicable for the analysis of many different processes , ranging from completely inclusive to exclusive ones ( for comprehensive reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since the gpds are essentially nonperturbative quantities , no methods exist so far , which allow to obtain them directly from qcd . at present the only realistic way to get gpds is to try to extract them from relevant experimental data @xcite ( which test only convolution of gpds and specific kernels ) and lattice data @xcite ( which only can provide moments of gpds ) .",
    "probably only global fits will be selective enough to really determine more than the most dominant gpds .",
    "such fits naturally rely heavily on @xmath2-evolution",
    ". this problem can be already treated within perturbative qcd .",
    "the equation governing the @xmath2 dependence of gpds  the evolution equation  is well known . since the gpds are related to matrix elements of certain operators , the evolution equation for gpds follows from the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the latter . in special cases",
    "the gpd evolution equation reduces to the famous dglap  @xcite and erbl @xcite evolution equations .",
    "however , the general structure of solutions of the evolution equation for gpds was poorly understood so far .",
    "several approaches  @xcite were proposed in the past to get a solution for the general evolution equation for gpds .",
    "all of them try to exploit the fact that gegenbauer moments of gpds have a simple scale dependence .",
    "however , the gegenbauer polynomials do not form a complete set in the region where the gpds are defined .",
    "this leads to the known problems when one tries to restore the gpds by their gegenbauer moments .",
    "the numerical algorithms based on these methods are rather cumbersome and ineffective ( see for discussion ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , we presented a new method for solving the gpd evolution equation  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the correct incorporation of the symmetry properties of the evolution equation and provides a clear physical picture for the evolution . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the evolution equation for the gluon gpds related to the matrix element of the twist two gluon operator and for simplicity neglected the effects of the mixing with quark - antiquark operators . in the present paper we give a detailed description of this approach for the example of the flavor nonsinglet quark gpd and present the solution of the evolution equation for the flavor singlet gpd which takes into account mixing between quark and gluon operators .",
