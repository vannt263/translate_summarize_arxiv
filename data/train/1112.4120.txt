    "since klein s formulation  @xcite of his gedanken experiment in 1929 and its interpretation by sauter  @xcite , heisenberg and euler  @xcite , and hund  @xcite it became clear that the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is unstable against the electron - positron pair production in the present of external electromagnetic field .",
    "the first discussions were all done at the level of first - quantized field theory .",
    "the results were rederived within second - quantized field theory in the one - loop approximation by schwinger  @xcite for a constant electromagnetic field , and nikishov  @xcite and narozhny and nikishov  @xcite for more general field configurations .",
    "the two - loop radiative corrections were calculated by ritus  @xcite and lebedev and ritus  @xcite .",
    "the spin - statistics connection in qed with unstable vacuum was discussed by feynman  @xcite . a general discussion , detailed calculations and further references on this subject can be found in refs .  @xcite . for recent developments and the modern state of the problem ,",

    "the rate  ( [ 0.1 ] ) results from the imaginary part of the one - loop euler - heisenberg lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the formula  ( [ 0.1 ] ) was anticipated by sauter  @xcite and derived by euler and heisenberg  @xcite and , more elegantly , by schwinger  @xcite .",
    "it is presently often referred to as schwinger formula , and the pair creation process as schwinger mechanism of pair production .",
    "the process can be understood within the dirac picture of vacuum as a quantum tunneling of electron through an electrostatic potential barrier created by the electric field .",
    "its rate is , however , exponentially suppressed for presently accessible field strengths @xmath0 achieved roughly @xmath6 by optical lasers  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the present impossibility of observing the pair creation for which the extraordinary strong electric field strengths @xmath0 of the order or above the critical value @xmath7 are required .",
    "while creating such strong macroscopic fields in the laboratory is impossible today , it will hopefully be achieved in the near future after further advances in the laser technology .",
    "indeed , the energy extraction and the optical focusing can be improved considerably in the x - ray free electron lasers to produce the electric field of the order of @xmath8 capable of yielding a sizeable effect of pair production  @xcite . under these circumstances",
    ", we could get a significant progress in understanding the properties of qed beyond the scope of perturbation theory in the strong - field regime .",
    "of course , such strong macroscopic fields in the laboratory would never be as uniform as those originally considered in the schwinger mechanism of pair creation .",
    "their spatial and temporal modulations must be taken into account in optical and , especially , in x - ray free electron lasers ( for review , see ref .",

    "apart from these , enormous electromagnetic and gravitational fields are expected in the powerful gamma ray bursts , strong coulomb fields in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions and nonabelian gauge fields in qcd , for which the schwinger mechanism of pair creation is also relevant  @xcite .",
    "going beyond the constant fields in space and time is therefore an important goal in studying pair creation .",

    "the back - reaction of produced pairs on the external field has been also taken into account in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for an arbitrary shape of background field",
    "the study of pair creation becomes rather involved , so that only special field configurations have been considered . in fact , one has to find the scattering and pair production probability densities in terms of solutions of the single - particle klein - gordon or dirac equation in the presence of external field yielding the bogoliubov transformation coefficients within the @xmath9-matrix formalism .",
    "in addition , the energy - momentum integral over the level - crossing ( klein ) region involving logarithm of the reflection coefficient must be performed . in this way",
    ", one can connect in a most transparent and efficient way the one - particle dirac theory , in which the klein paradox appeared with the second - quantized field theory , in which it was resolved satisfactorily .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the problem of pair creation of dirac particles in a spatially nonuniform and static electric field @xmath10 directed in the @xmath11-axis and varied only along this axis , where @xmath12 is the sauter field of the form @xmath13 with the peak @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are associated with the height and the width of the electrostatic potential @xmath18 created by the field @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "explicitly , it reads @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the limit @xmath22 leads to a sharp step , whereas the limit @xmath23 with @xmath24 fixed reproduces the linear potential caused by a constant field @xmath25 .    with no magnetic field",
    ", we use the gauge @xmath26 in which the dirac equation allows the full separation of variables . as a result",
    ", the problem of pair production is reduced to an exactly solvable quantum - mechanical problem  @xcite of the scattering of a dirac particle on the static potential barrier  ( [ 0.2 ] ) .",
    "the problem is recapitulated in section  2 .",
    "this provides us with exact expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of scattering data for both the sub- and the supercritical values of the potential  ( [ 0.2 ] ) . for supercritical barriers with",
    "the level crossing between positive and negative energy levels , the klein paradox is connected with the vacuum instability via the electron - positron pair production . in section  3 , we discuss how the reflection and transmission amplitudes are related to the pair production rates , first for a certain particular state , and then by taking all these states into account .",
    "in particular , the total vacuum decay rate due to pair creation is expressed as an energy and transverse momentum integral over the level - crossing ( klein ) region involving the logarithm of reflection coefficient .    the quantum - mechanical scattering amplitudes on the potential barrier  ( [ 0.2 ] )",
    "have been known since suater s work  @xcite , and their relation to the pair production probabilities since nikishov s work  @xcite . in order to find the pair production rates",
    ", we must however complete that work by evaluating the energy - momentum integral for a given local probabilities .",
    "the method of calculating such an integral has been developed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section  3 ,",
    "we apply this method to perform the rotationally invariant integral over transverse momenta in three dimensions exactly .",
    "the remaining integral over the energy , after an appropriate change of variable , provides us with simple spectral formulas for the vacuum decay rate and also for the pair production rate .",
    "the analytic expressions for these rates are derived in section  4 for the entire range of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath27 of the supercritical potential  ( [ 0.2 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to access different physical regimes from weak to strong fields .    in the weak - field regime",
    "corresponding to presently available field strengths , the supercritical potential  ( [ 0.2 ] ) can only create the pairs near the constant limit .",
    "the pair production rate is very small and is described by the semiclassical expressions of refs .",
    "@xcite which are recovered and slightly corrected in this paper .",
    "the constant - field limit of the vacuum decay rate is found to be different from the schwinger formula  ( [ 0.1 ] ) .",
    "it agrees , however , with formula  ( [ 0.1 ] ) , if the latter is properly averaged over the width of a spatial variation . as a such",
    ", this limit represents the locally constant - field rate .",
    "the explanation as well as the detailed comparison of the two constant - field rates can be found in appendix  a.    with increasing field strength from weak- to strong - field regime , the supercritical potential  ( [ 0.2 ] ) creates the pairs much more intensively over entire field width extended from sharp to the constant limit .",
    "the corresponding expression for the vacuum decay rate becomes very large but interpolates analytically between these limits always below the locally constant - field rate .",
    "the latter is therefore the upper limit for the spatially nonuniform electric field  ( [ 0.3 ] ) .",
