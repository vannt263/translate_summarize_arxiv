    "adsorbed overlayers under a driving force have attracted much interest recently @xcite as important examples of driven lattice systems @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear response of the overlayer in the presence of pinning centers resulted in various steady states , corresponding to a variety of different nonequilibrium dynamic phases .",
    "the nature of these dynamic phases and the transitions from one phase into each other are the microscopic factors controlling the macroscopic sliding friction and boundary lubrication @xcite .",
    "other closely related systems include vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , charge - density waves @xcite and colloidal crystal layers @xcite .",
    "in general , both a periodic potential and disorder due to quenched defects are present in theses systems .",
    "in particular , in the sliding friction and boundary lubrication of surfaces the underlying crystal lattice provides the periodic pinning potential which competes with defect pinning centers due to impurities .    for periodic substrates",
    ", it has been shown through molecular dynamics simulation studies that there are different dynamical phases for the driven overlayer such as pinned solid , sliding solid and liquid phases .",
    "the transitions between these phases often involve strong hysteresis effects @xcite , leading to important macroscopic behavior as the stick and slip motion , which can be observed experimentally with the surface force apparatus @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical results were based on two - dimensional models of overlayers with lennard - jones potential interaction between the adatoms.@xcite .",
    "the results on these dynamical phases have been found to be universal and are reproduced even in models with pure elastic interacting potential @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , it has also been shown that , in the sliding state , the response of the overlayer to an additional force in the transverse direction can also lead to a depinning transition at low temperatures .",
    "different sliding states also occur in presence of quasiperiodic substrates and have been investigated in detail recently for one - dimensional models @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of disorder on the main features observed for two - dimensional systems , which can arise , for example , from point defects on a initially periodic substrate , have not been investigated satisfactorily so far .",
    "considerable analytical and numerical results are only available for driven lattice systems described by overdamped dynamics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is known that inertial effects significantly modify the nature of the depinning transition @xcite .",
    "hence the results for these overdamped systems can not be directly applied to the sliding friction problem involving adsorbed overlyers on a substrate .    in this work ,",
    "we study numerically the nonlinear sliding friction of adsorbed overlayers on disordered substrates with a specific model of point defects , where the strength of the disorder can be varied by changing the concentration of the defects .",
    "we investigate the longitudinal and transverse response for weak and strong disorder by brownian molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we find that the main features , such as hysteresis , longitudinal and transverse depinning transitions previously observed for periodic surfaces @xcite , still survive in the presence of weak disorder but are smeared out in the strong disorder limit .",
    "recently , the depinning transition of kr films on gold has been studied using the quartz crystal microbalance technique @xcite .",
    "our results for the longitudinal response bear a strong qualitative resemblance to the experimental data of the depinning transition .",
    "in particular , it provides concrete theoretical support to the speculation that the aging effect on the depinning transition is due to the increasing disorder of the substrate .",
    "the model of interacting adatoms on a substrate with point disorder subject to an external driving force for the present study is a simple extension of the one previously used for periodic substrates @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is described by the langevin equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the adsorbate position , @xmath2 is the substrate pinning potential , @xmath3 is the interactions between adatoms , @xmath4 is the uniform external force acting on each adatom and @xmath5 is a stochastic force , with zero average , and variance related to the microscopic friction parameter @xmath6 , the mass of the particles @xmath7 and the temperature @xmath8 by the fluctuation dissipation relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents cartesian components .",

    "the position of the pinning centers @xmath12 is randomly chosen on a square lattice of lattice parameter @xmath18 and linear size @xmath19 . with this choice ,",
    "a pinning center consists of a square region with a force that vanishes smoothly at the boundary . for @xmath20 ,",
    "a constant , the entire substrate potential reduces to the periodic cosine potential in eq .",
    "[ ppot ] studied previously @xcite .",
    "the strength of disorder is controlled by varying the concentration @xmath21 of randomly chosen pinning centers . in the dilute limit of @xmath22 ,",
    "corresponding to weak disorder , this pinning potential has a predominant fourier component at the wavevector @xmath23 . in the other limit of dense pinning centers with @xmath24",

    "is represented by a lennard - jones pair potential @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the well depth and @xmath27 is the particle separation at the minima in the pair potential .",
    "we have chosen the parameters in the interaction potential to be @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the adsorbate coverage at @xmath30 .",
    "this choice is made such that the ground state of the overlayer in the periodic substrate ( @xmath31 ) corresponds to the commensurate pinned @xmath32 structure studied previously . for the periodic substrate , the longitudinal and transverse response of the commensurate overlayer to an applied force in the present model",
    "have been extensively studied in connection with the sliding friction and boundary lubrication @xcite problem .",

    "we study the nonlinear response of the overlayer at different temperatures and pinning center concentrations via brownian molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",

    "the main results were obtained for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for each set of parameters , calculations were performed for typically @xmath42 time steps to allow the system to reach steady state .",
    "then an equal number of time steps are used to evaluate time - averaged values of various physical quantities in this steady state .",
    "finally , the results are also averaged over a number of ( typically 6 - 11 ) different realizations of the disorder through the distribution of the @xmath15 value for the pinning centers .",
    "the longitudinal response to an applied force at a temperature @xmath43 , well below the melting transition temperature of the @xmath44 phase on a periodic substrate , @xmath45 , is shown in figs .",

    "the drift velocity @xmath48 is essentially zero below a critical value of @xmath49 ( neglecting the tiny contribution from thermal creep motion which is always present for nonzero force ) .",
    "when the driving force exceeds the critical value @xmath49 , there is a sharp depinning transition where the overlayer starts to slide and the drift velocity increases rapidly .",

    ", width=302 ]    recently carlin et al @xcite have studied the depinning transition under an external driving force for kr films on gold .",
    "they employed the quartz crystal microbalance technique . in this technique ,",
    "the quartz crystal is driven to resonance by an external rf voltage with the kr film adsorbed on the gold electrodes .",
    "the driving force on the admolecules is proportional to the oscillation amplitude @xmath58 of the electrodes and the resultant response of the kr film is measured through the `` slipping time '' @xmath59 which is inversely proportional to the sliding friction @xmath60 . for a given coverage of the kr film , they found a sharp depinning transition when the oscillation amplitude exceeds a critical value .",
    "this transition shows the same kind of hysteresis effects as obtained in our weak disorder result shown in fig.[lx01 ] .",
    "a very interesting result they found is that the depinning transition changes as a function of aging of the system . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hyst]a , the depinning transition is sharp and shows hysteresis behavior after 1 day .",
    "however , the corresponding results after 10 days show a rounded transition without hysteresis . the authors speculated that this change is probably due to the deposition of foreign molecules onto the gold electrode substrate , acting then as defect pinning centers .",
    "in other words , the disorder of the substrate increases with aging . in fig . [ hyst]b , we combine the numerical results for @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the present model to show the effect of increasing density of defect pinning centers on the depinning transition .",
    "our results bear a strong qualitative resemblance to the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "in particular , while the weak disorder ( @xmath46 ) substrate shows a sharp depinning transition with strong hysteresis effect , the depinning transition for the strong disorder ( @xmath47 ) substrate is smeared out and there is no trace of hysteresis in this case .",
    "in fact , our result for the strong disorder case bears a strong qualitative resemblance to the experimental data aged after 10 days .",
    "thus , the theoretical results obtained in our present model study clearly support the speculation @xcite that the aging effect on the depinning transition observed in the quartz microbalance experiment is due to the increasing disorder of the substrate . another interesting feature of the experimental results in fig .",
    "3a is the monotonic decrease of the slip time with aging .",
    "it should be noted that this effect is not seen in fig .",
    "3b because the nonlinear sliding friction @xmath61 is normalized by the unknown microscopic friction parameter @xmath62 , contained in the effective model of eq .",
    "this parameter is essentially the frictional damping of individual adatoms due to coupling to the substrate .",
    "as the morphology of the substrate changes , the frictional damping may change significantly .",
    "so the monotonic decrease of the slip time in fig .",
    "3a can be accommodated within our model as resulting from an increase in this microscopic frictional damping with aging .",
    "the calculation of this microscopic parameter will certainly require a detailed theoretical model for this mechanism including realistic potentials which are outside the scope of the present work .     as a function of the amplitude of substrate oscillations , obtained from experiments on kr / gd films using the quartz crystal microbalance technique , by carlin _",

    ", width=302 ]      to understand the nature of the sliding state at different sliding velocities , it is useful to introduce , just as in the periodic case @xcite , the concept of an effective temperature @xmath56 of the sliding overlayer .",
    "this is defined via the velocity fluctuation as @xmath63 for a meaningful definition of this effective temperature , one would expect that the velocity distribution should be gaussian and the width of the distribution related to the effective temperature by eq .",

    "[ vel ] where it is shown that the velocity distribution at @xmath64 is in fact well described by a gaussian both for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    , @xmath65 , for @xmath46 ( a ) and @xmath47 ( b ) .",
    "continuous line is a gaussian fit.,width=302 ]    the behavior of the effective temperature @xmath56 under the driving force carries important information for the structure properties of the sliding state . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ lx01 ] , in the dilute disorder case with @xmath46 , this effective temperature is much higher than @xmath8 in the region @xmath66 and decreases for @xmath50 , although never approaching @xmath8 as in the periodic case .",
    "this suggests that for weak disorder , the region for @xmath66 is strongly disordered and corresponds to a dynamically melted liquid phase . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the sliding state is a solid state with weak disorder . for the substrate with dense disorder @xmath47 ,",
    "the effective temperature remains much higher than @xmath8 even for large driving force , suggesting that in this case the overlayer remains in a liquid like or floating state even at large driving force and high drift velocities .",

    "the angular brackets denote thermal averages and the square brackets disorder averages .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "for a fully ordered configuration the normalized structure factor @xmath73 at the peak for a wavevector corresponding to the ordered structure .",
    "as expected , for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 cases , this value is much smaller at the nonzero wavevectors confirming that the sliding layer in the presence of the disorder does not have full long range order . for @xmath46",
    "the structure factor shows clear prominent peaks at wavevectors corresponding to a commensurate @xmath74 structure , ( @xmath75 ) , consistent with a weak disordered sliding solid state . for @xmath47 ,",
    "corresponding to the strong disorder limit , one can identify in the structure factor still well defined , although weaker , peaks at the positions corresponding to an incommensurate hexagonal structure .",
    "however , the information about the initial periodic substrate no longer exists .",
    "the structure of the overlayer in this strong disorder limit can be characterized as an incommensurate floating state both in @xmath76 and @xmath77 directions rather than as a liquid state .     at @xmath65 , @xmath78 for dilute disorder @xmath46 ( a ) and dense disorder @xmath47 ( b ) .",

    ", width=302 ]    finally , we like to examine how the results presented here depends on the details of the modelling of the disorder and defect pinning centers . in this regard , it is interesting to compare the results presented here with a previous work by persson @xcite where the disorder was implemented by fixing one of the adsorbate atoms",
    ". it was found that in this case , corresponding to @xmath80 ( linear size @xmath81 ) , the effective temperature @xmath56 increases with increasing force for @xmath82 and that the sliding incommensurate solid phase observed for the periodic substrate is destroyed and replaced by a fluid state . at first sight",
    "this seems to be in total contrast to the results found in this work for the corresponding dilute disorder limit . to understand this difference",
    ", we note that in a strict two - dimensional model , all the adsorbate particles are confined to move in the @xmath76-@xmath77 plane only .",
    "hence , the structure of the sliding layer has to undergo strong distortions in the vicinity of the fixed impurity atom , due to the hard core repulsion of the lennard - jones interacting potential , leading to a fluid phase .",
    "thus , in this fixed - impurity model , even a low concentration of impurities actually correspond to strong disorder , in sharp contrast to the model studied here .",
    "one would expect that even for the fixed impurity model , a very small concentration of impurities should lead to a more ordered sliding state . to verify this ,",
    "we have computed the structure factor for the fixed impurity model at two concentration of @xmath80 ( linear size @xmath81 ) and @xmath83 ( linear size @xmath79 ) in the steady sliding state at @xmath72 . for @xmath81 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sfimp]a , the corresponding structure factor is characteristic of a fluid phase , in agreement with the findings of persson @xcite .",

    ", we find that there is a transverse depinning transition with a critical transverse force @xmath88 .",
    "this transverse depinning transition is accompanied by hysteresis behavior with the lower critical force @xmath89 .",
