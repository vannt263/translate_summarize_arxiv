    "electromagnetic observations have provided us with numerous insights into the cosmic growth history of black holes and the ( co-)evolution with their host galaxies .",
    "important advances of recent years include the discovery of quasars beyond redshift @xmath0 , population studies in deep and wide field surveys constraining the luminosity function and bh mass function out to high redshift , detailed studies of nearby galaxy mergers , and the emergence of binary active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , candidate smbbhs , and candidate recoiling smbhs .",
    "these have been accompanied by substantial progress on the theory side , including cosmological simulations of large - scale structure , galaxy merger simulations at super - high resolution and approaching the `` final parsec '' , breakthroughs in numerical relativity enabling simulations of smbbh coalescences , and intense ongoing investigations of potential electromagnetic signals quasi - simultaneous with binary coalescence .    despite this progress ,",
    "a number of important questions related to the growth and cosmological evolution of bhs remain partially unanswered :    \\(1 ) how and when did the first bhs form ?",

    "particularly tight constraints on the _ early _ bh growth have emerged from the discovery of luminous high - redshift quasars . at the time of writing , seven were known beyond redshift @xmath1 ( mortlock et al .",

    "they do not grow much beyond that anywhere in the cosmos ( fig .",

    "bhs accreting at the eddington limit ,    @xmath9    with accretion luminosity @xmath10=@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radiative efficiency , grow exponentially , as    @xmath13    the growth timescale depends on the radiative efficiency @xmath12 and therefore on bh spin .",
    "higher bh spin implies last stable orbits closer in , higher radiative efficiency , and therefore less rapid bh growth .",
    "for instance , it takes @xmath14 2 gyr for a bh to grow up to @xmath15 m@xmath4 if it is rapidly spinning ( @xmath12=0.3 ) .",

    "gas - rich galaxy mergers trigger quasar activity , provide the fuel source for bh growth , are the sites of feedback processes , and likely drive the bh - host scaling relations .",
    "the idea that luminous quasars are activated by galaxy interactions came up early , in the seventies ( e.g. , stockton & mackenty 1983 ) . since then , numerous studies have been carried out to address whether all agn activity is triggered by mergers .",
    "based on a recent compilation of results from several ir , optical and x - ray surveys up to @xmath18 , treister et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded , that the fraction of agn in mergers is a strong function of , and increases with , agn luminosity .",
    "the majority of the most luminous quasars all reside in major mergers .",
    "lower - luminosity agn , on the other hand , are likely triggered by secular processes like bar - driven inflows , stochastic cloud accretion events , minor mergers and perhaps stellar captures ( hopkins & hernquist 2009 ) .",
    "these differences may also explain cosmic downsizing ( review by brandt & hasinger 2005 ) .",
    "while the low - mass , low - luminosity agn make the majority in _ number _ , a large part of the total bh _ mass growth _",
    "likely occurrs in the most luminous quasars ( e.g. , treister et al .",
    "runaway bh growth in these gas - rich environments is plausibly prevented by feedback processes , which have also been invoked to explain the scaling relations between bhs and their host galaxies .",
    "the mass of the central smbh correlates tightly with a number of host galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion and total bulge mass ( review by graham 2015 ) .",
    "galaxy mergers are thought to be the main driver behind these relations , either by merging repeatedly with each other ( jahnke & maccio 2011 ) , or by triggering feedback processes such that the radiation from the accretion disk heats the ambient gas and drives strong outflows until  at a critical bh mass  the remaining gas is expelled which then terminates further bh growth and fixes the host properties ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "galaxies merge frequently throughout cosmic times . whenever both galaxies harbor smbhs at their centers , the formation of a binary smbh is inevitable .",
    "the merger evolves in several stages ( begelman et al .",
    "1980 ; our fig .",
    "( 1 ) the early stages of galaxy merging are driven by dynamical friction .",
    "( 2 ) at close separations , on the order of parsecs , the two smbhs form a bound pair .",
    "the further shrinkage of their orbit then depends on the efficiency of interactions with gas and stars in carrying away energy and angular momentum ; known as the `` final parsec problem '' ( review by colpi 2014 ) .",
    "( 3 ) at separations well below a parsec , emission of gws becomes efficient leading to further orbital shrinkage and final coalescence .",
    "this gw - driven regime can be thought of as proceeding in three stages ; the inspiral phase , dynamical merger , and final ringdown , which emit characteristic gw radiation ( e.g. , hughes 2002 ; review by centrella et al .",
    "( 4 ) depending on the orbital configuration including masses and spins of the binary , after coalescence the newly formed single smbh then recoils with a velocity as high as @xmath14 5000 km / s ( lousto & zlochower 2011 ; review by sperhake 2015 ) but typically much lower .",
    "prime examples of gas - rich galaxy mergers are luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies [ ( u)lirgs ; sanders et al .",
    "these allow us to study the stages of galaxy merging in the nearby universe , and are more abundant in the higher - redshift universe , where they become a major galaxy population .",
    "based on an analysis of _ hst _ images , kartaltepe et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded , that at least 70% of ulirgs at redshift @xmath19 reside in interacting systems .",
    "nearby ( u)lirgs provide us with excellent laboratories for studying the physics and evolution of galaxy mergers , and the triggering of agn activity at their centers ( e.g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "one of the first observed with high - resolution x - ray imaging spectroscopy with _",
    "chandra _ was the nearby ulirg ngc6240 , which let to the detection of a pair of x - ray luminous agn at its center ( komossa et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "meanwhile , more cases of agn pairs have emerged , based on x - ray , radio and optical imaging spectroscopy .",
    "the majority of these is found in galaxy pairs in relatively early stages of their evolution ( see fig . 2 of deane et al .",
    "2014 for a compilation of wide systems at @xmath20 10 kpc spatial separation , as well as recent work by comerford et al .",
    "2015 , fu et al .",
    "2015 , de rosa et al .",
    "2015 , and references therein ) .",
    "only 35 systems are currently known which host binary agn below @xmath141 kpc spatial separation , which are located in single galaxies or advanced mergers .",
    "besides ngc6240 , these are j0402 + 379 in the radio ( at only 7pc projected separation ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2006 , burke - spolaor 2011 ) , sdssj13230159 in the optical ( woo et al .",
    "2014 ) , ngc3393 in x - rays ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2011 ; see koss et al .",
    "2015 for a different interpretation ) , and sdssj1502 + 1115 ( deane et al . 2014",
    "; see wrobel et al .",
    "2014 for a different interpretation ) .",
    "all of these nearby pairs , upon their final coalescence , would be easily detectable in gws with a _ lisa_-type mission ( e.g. , fig",
    ". 1 of colpi 2014 ) . at present , radio - vlbi observations provide us with the most powerful technique of resolving smbh pairs at small angular separation .",
    "the most compact systems , supermassive binary bhs , can no longer be spatially resolved with current techniques , and we therefore rely on indirect methods when searching for them electromagnetically .",
    "most search strategies are based on signs of semi - periodicity , for instance in lightcurves 12 yr optical periodicity is one of the best - studied cases ( e.g. , valtonen et al . 2012 ) ] or in the spatial structures of radio jets .",
    "others include double - peaked emission lines or unusual spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at the time when the advanced binary has opened a gap in the inner accretion disk ( see komossa & zensus 2016 for a review of signatures and pre-2015 smbbh candidates ) .",
    "several recent candidates have emerged from large - sky surveys and long - term monitoring programs .",
    "pg1302102 ( graham et al . 2015 , dorazio et al . 2015 , see also kun et al .",
    "2015 ) , psoj334.2028 + 01.4075 ( liu et al .",
    "2015 ) , and pg1553 + 113 ( ackermann et al . 2015 ) all show pronounced semi - periodic lightcurve variability ; while mrk231 ( yan et al . 2015 ) exhibits a uv - dim sed characteristic of a binary - driven gap in the accretion disk .",
    "all of these detection methods of smbbhs require at least one bh to be active . in order to trace the population of inactive binaries , liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed to take advantage of epochs of temporary activity in form of accretion flares from tidally disrupted stars in these systems . as the second bh temporarily interrupts the stellar debris stream on the primary , it causes characteristic dips and recoveries in the tidal disruption lightcurve .",
    "this signature has been identified in the lightcurve of sdssj120136.02 + 300305.5 , which is consistent with the presence of a sub - milliparsec smbbh ( liu et al .",
    "2014 ) .    finally , post - coalescence candidates include radio galaxies with characteristic structures [ double - doubles or x - shaped systems ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2003 , roberts et al .",
    "2015 ) , interpreted as evidence for the interruption and re - start of accretion activity during coalescence , and/or bh spin flips ] , and recoiling black holes of which a few candidates have been identified in recent years ( review by komossa 2012 ) .",
    "all of the questions raised in sect .",
    "1 can efficiently be addressed with gw astronomy with space - based observatories and pulsar timing arrays ( e.g. , hughes 2002 , menou 2003 , centrella 2003 , sesana 2013 , mcwilliams et al .",
    "2014 , colpi 2014 , barausse et al . 2015 ) , in a completely independent and sometimes unique way .",
    "we do not yet have any direct observations of the first seed bhs .",
    "they may form as light seeds from the collapse of the first massive stars , or as massive seeds through direct collapse of large gas clouds . in the near future",
    ", we will not be able to observe this regime directly electromagnetically , except perhaps through high - redshift grbs . in gws , and with an _ elisa_-type mission , low - mass bhs would be observable out to redshifts @xmath21 ( colpi 2014 ) ; in a crucial regime of galaxy assembly and seed bh formation and growth .      while current searches for tightly bound smbbhs continue to be challenging , and we still lack `` smoking gun '' signatures for incontrovertible identifications of such binaries , gw observations can provide a strongly complementary view .",
    "where gravity is strong enough to produce observable gws , it is expected to dominate the process , leading to clear gw signatures with very straightforward physical interpretations .",
    "further , if multimessenger observations are possible then a few gw observations may be leveraged to eventually hone our interpretation of more numerous electromagnetic binary candidates .",
    "in particular , gws from coalescing binaries enable high - precision measurements of bh masses and spins .",
    "measurements of coalescence rates ( including extreme mass - ratio inspirals ) inform us about the merger history of galaxies and constrain the accretion history ( from spin measurements ) .",
    "pulsar timing arrays have just started to place constraints on galaxy merger history from limits on the stochastic gw background ( e.g. , zhu et al .",
    "2014 , arzoumanian et al .",
    "2015 , lentati et al .",
    "2015 , shannon et al .",
    "gw astronomy therefore provides us with unique tracers of black hole assembly and growth , including new constraints on the importance of accretion , merging and stellar captures in growing black holes , and on the bh spin history ."
