    "@xcite are particularly attractive for cqed experiments because they combine several desirable features . formed by dielectric mirrors on the end - facets of opposing optical glass fibers ,",
    "ffpcs provide small mode volumes , high optical q factors , direct access to the cavity mode and intrinsic fiber coupling of the mode field .",

    "the resonator - enhanced light - matter interaction in cqed experiments relies on the precise tuning of a cavity resonance to an optical transition of the quantum system under investigation . in ever more miniaturized and integrated experimental setups",
    "the task of stabilizing high - finesse ffpcs to within a small fraction of their optical linewidth ( corresponding to mirror displacements of order @xmath0pm ) can pose significant challenges .",
    "in particular for future applications of high finesse micro - resonators , e.g. in portable devices that can operate outside of dedicated laboratory environments , novel technical solutions for assembly and stabilization will be required that are robust and compact .",
    "additional challenges , which need to be considered for ffpcs but do not occur for cavities with macroscopic mirror substrates , arise from the direct fiber coupling of light to the resonator mode .",
    "for instance , due to the intrinsic fiber coupling , the efficiencies to couple light to and from the cavity mode are set by the relative alignment of the fiber mirrors . in order to achieve optimal cavity alignment",
    "it is therefore important to find strategies to accurately characterize the coupling efficiencies already during the assembling of the resonator .    in this article",

    "the design and the completed assembly of the piezo - mechanically actuated fiber fabry - perot cavity are shown in figure  [ fig : piezocavity ] .",
    "the cavity is aligned by setting the two opposing fiber mirrors at the desired length of the cavity , rotating one fiber mirror around its axis to minimize the cavity polarization mode splitting  @xcite and varying the transverse mirror positions and angles to maximize the cavity to fiber mode coupling efficiency ( see section  [ sec : theorymodematching ] ) .",
    "the fibers are then glued onto individual v - grooves including high - voltage shear piezos .",
    "the piezos allow the cavity length to be scanned over more than one free spectral range once the stacks have been glued onto a common base plate . to avoid misalignment of the cavity in the transversal directions during curing and vacuum bake - out we utilize uv curable glue   for the final bonding of the cavity and keep the thickness of glue layers to a minimum .",

    "the dominant source of drifts of the locked cavity is the fluctuation of the ffpc relative to the `` lock '' laser , probably caused by residual interferences in the fiber ( see next section ) .",

    "[ fig : pdhcharacterization ]",
    "the direct coupling of light from optical fibers to the cavity mode and vice versa is an important feature of ffpcs that can strongly benefit integration and miniaturization of optical cavities .",
    "the intrinsic fiber connection , however , can also give rise to adverse effects that do not occur for macroscopic fabry - perot cavities coupled by free - space beams .",
    "a first , simple example for the experimental challenges specific to ffpcs is the avoidance of reflections when coupling `` lock '' light into the ffpc s optical fiber .",
    "optical interferences along the beam path between the electro - optical modulator , the resonator and the photo detector can lead to time - varying offsets in the pound - drever - hall error signal  @xcite and thereby cause drifts in the cavity lock .",
    "we have tested several different methods to minimize optical reflections at the fiber in - coupler , including angle cleaving and manual fc / apc connectorization .",
    "the best results have been obtained by fusion splicing the ffpc single mode fibers to commercially connectorized fc / apc single mode fibers .      an important difference between ffpcs and traditional cavities concerns the coupling of light to the resonator mode . for ffpcs",
    "the spatial mode matching between the cavity mode and the incoming and outgoing fiber guided light fields are intrinsically determined by the relative alignment of the fiber mirrors .",
    "once the fiber mirrors have been fixed in position , the coupling into the cavity can not be altered any more .",
    "the two spatial mode matching efficiencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 are important figures of merit that enter the resonant transmission efficiency of a ffpc @xmath36 and determine the probability to retrieve a cavity photon @xmath37 at the fiber output @xmath38 ht or lt . for cavity - based light - matter interfaces ,",
    "@xmath39 furthermore sets an upper limit to the efficiency of mapping photons from mirror side @xmath40 into the cavity - coupled quantum system .",
    "many applications of ffpcs therefore rely on a method to determine and optimize a particular mode matching efficiency ( in our case @xmath34 ) during the alignment of the cavity",
    ".    measurements of the ffpc transmission depend according to eq .",
    "[ eq : transmission ] on the product @xmath41 and can therefore not be applied to separately determine the mode matching efficiencies of ffpcs consisting of two single mode fibers .",
    "naturally the simple transmission method also fails for one - sided ffpcs with one non - transparent mirror substrate .",
    "reflection measurements , on the other hand , offer the possibility to characterize and optimize the individual mode matching efficiencies .",
    "their evaluation , however , requires a more careful analysis than has previously been considered , in order to extract @xmath39 from the observed drop in the power of the reflected light on resonance .",
    "the treatment of the reflective coupling problem in terms of the interference of spatially mode filtered light fields ( see section  [ sec : theorymodematching ] and supplemental material   for details and  @xcite for earlier related works on the topic ) gives rise to two important practical results for ffpcs :    ) . the fit function ( solid line , eq .",
    "[ eq : asymmetricline ] normalized to the off - resonantly detected power ) predicted by the mode matching model is the sum of a lorentzian ( dotted line ) and its corresponding dispersive function ( dashed line ) . *",
    "b * the transmitted power follows a lorentzian curve . ]",
    "[ fig : lineshape ]    first , our calculations show that for strongly overcoupled ffpcs , where the transmission of the incoupling mirror strongly exceeds the sum of all other contributions to the round trip losses ( @xmath42 ) , the alignment that maximizes the depth of reflected incoupling dip does not maximize the spatial mode matching efficiency @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , for this experimentally very relevant type of one - sided cavity , the maximum depth of the incoupling dip will approach unity for misalignments that significantly reduce the mode matching efficiency .",
    "we experimentally confirm this result with measurements on a strongly overcoupled test cavity and find good agreement with the theoretical predictions ( see section  [ sec : theorymodematching ] ) .",
    "second , the model explains for the first time the origin of the asymmetry of ffpc resonance line shapes that are observed in reflection but not in transmission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lineshape ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry is found to be an intrinsic property of ffpcs and independent of the power and polarization of the incident light .",
    "the asymmetric reflective line shapes are described by the sum of a lorentzian and its corresponding dispersive function @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the alignment - independent fraction of light that is detected in reflection for the off - resonant cavity .",
    "both the lorentzian amplitude @xmath45 and the relative size of the dispersive component , which we introduce as the asymmetry parameter @xmath46 , depend on the cavity geometry and alignment ( see section  [ sec : theorymodematching ] for details ) .",
    "we find good agreement between theory and experimental measurements , thereby confirming our modeling of the effects of spatial mode filtering in ffpcs .      finally , fiber generated background counts arise as an additional issue when employing ffpcs in cqed setups that operate at the single photon level . in these experiments",
    "single `` signal '' photons , which are resonant with the quantum system under investigation , need to be detected in the presence of the strong off - resonant `` lock '' light , which is needed for stabilizing the cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lockingscheme ] ) . in the case of cold neutral atoms",
    "the `` lock '' light furthermore acts as a optical dipole potential and determines the confinement of the neutral atoms . for the parameters of our piezo - actuated ffpc , an axial confinement of rubidium atoms of @xmath29mk depth corresponds to @xmath47w of @xmath23 nm `` lock '' light entering the incoupling fiber of the ffpc .",
    "the separation of single `` signal '' photons from this strong `` lock '' light relies on spectral filtering , since the polarization degree of freedom is a resource needed for many cqed protocols .",
    "experimentally , we find that after the suppression of `` lock '' laser photons at @xmath23 nm by a series of band - pass interference filters ( combined values : peak transmission @xmath48% and effective filter bandwidth of @xmath49thz at @xmath15 nm ; extinction @xmath50db at @xmath23 nm ) the photon background is limited by frequency conversion inside the single mode fiber .",
    "inelastic scattering of photons from @xmath23 nm to @xmath15 nm wavelength was measured to scale linearly in `` lock '' power @xmath51 ( in the range 1@xmath52w to 2@xmath22mw ) and fiber length @xmath53 ( 1-@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the process happens at comparable rates both in the forward and backward direction , is spectrally uniform over the filter bandwidth around @xmath15 nm and predominantly conserves the polarization .",
    "the rate of background photons for the @xmath23 nm `` lock '' light is well described by @xmath54 , where @xmath55s@xmath56w@xmath56hz@xmath56m@xmath56 is the spectral efficiency for shifting light at @xmath23 nm to @xmath15 nm wavelength .",
    "we have found similar background rates for red detuned `` lock '' light at @xmath57 nm ( @xmath58s@xmath56w@xmath56hz@xmath56m@xmath56 ) . for even further red detuned light at @xmath16 nm , frequency conversion to @xmath15 nm",
    "is energetically strongly suppressed ( @xmath59s@xmath56w@xmath56hz@xmath56m@xmath56 ) . however , in neutral atom cqed experiments the use of `` lock '' light with small frequency detuning is in many cases preferable , because it gives rise to similar coupling strengths to the `` signal '' mode for atoms trapped at different positions along the `` lock '' trap  @xcite .",
    "the observed spectral conversion efficiencies for the three different pump wavelengths agree within a factor of two with values expected for spontaneous raman scattering in optical fibers  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the background photon detection rate of @xmath60s@xmath56 in our setup is limited by raman scattering and can therefore only be reduced by narrower spectral filtering and shorter optical fibers .",
    "piezo - actuated designs , such as the cavity described in section  [ sec : piezocavity ] , have been the established solution for realizing high finesse ffpcs in recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "the unique feature of this cavity design is the possibility to perform large , piezo - controlled scans of the cavity resonance , which can cover more than the free spectral range of the resonator . for many applications ,",
    "however , ffpcs only require referencing to well - defined optical transition frequencies and could therefore benefit from alternative stabilization solutions that are potentially less complex , more robust , and better suited for miniaturization , integration and scalability . in the following",
    "we will present such a novel approach that is based on the high passive stability and precise thermal tunability of a rigid ffpc design .        the construction of our rigid ffpc , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rigidcavitydesign ] , is inspired by the design of ultra - stable passive fabry - perot reference cavities  @xcite , where a constant cavity length is maintained by a monolithic cavity spacer with minimal thermal expansion and low vibrational sensitivity . to form the rigid cavity , two single mode mirror fibers with a cladding diameter of @xmath61",
    "are inserted into a fused - quartz fiber ferrule with a bore of @xmath62 m in diameter .",
    "the ferrule ensures the transversal alignment of the two cavity fibers , while a @xmath63m - wide cut at the center provides access to the cavity mode .",
    "the rotational degree of freedom can be used to maximize the fiber to cavity mode coupling for decentered fiber mirrors or alternatively to minimize the polarization mode splitting in the case of fibers with elliptical mirror shapes  @xcite .",
    "precise longitudinal adjustment of the cavity length is performed by displacing one of the fibers with a piezo stage in order to set the cavity resonance to the desired frequency .",
    "the fibers are successively fixed in place by applying small amounts of glue to the optical fibers where they exit the ends of the ferrule . due to capillary action",
    ", the low viscosity glue   evenly fills the few @xmath33 m wide gap between the ferrule bore and the inserted mirror fibers . in order to avoid misalignment during the room temperature curing of the glue ,",
    "the cavity resonance is tracked by monitoring the transmission of a `` probe '' laser , and changes of cavity length are continuously compensated by the piezo stage until the glue becomes viscous .",
    "typical frequency shifts during the hardening of the cavity that we have obtained with this method are @xmath64ghz .",
    "we believe that a further reduction of the misalignment could for example be achieved by filling the glue with sio@xmath1 nanospheres .",
    "depending on the mounting positions of the cavity and the attached optical fibers , constant stress induced frequency shifts on the order of @xmath0ghz can be observed for the rigid cavity . to reduce the coupling to mechanical vibrations and external temperature fluctuations ,",
    "we horizontally suspend the rigid cavity by its optical fibers ( see fig .  [",

    "a theoretical estimate considering the linear expansion of the optical fibers , the cavity spacer and the coating predicts a value of @xmath72mhz / k .",
    "we attribute the large observed temperature sensitivity to the influence of the connecting glue layer and expect that the thermal response to uniform temperature changes of the entire ffpc could be tuned by filling the glue in the future .      an experimentally convenient way of controlling the temperature of a rigid cavity is by absorption of light from an external heating laser .",
    "the use of a heating laser enables strongly localized heating , requires only very limited amount of ( optical ) access and is compatible with ultra - high - vacuum setups .",
