    "some compact binaries may also evolve directly from primordial binaries in this cluster ( davies 1997 ) .",

    "the acs mosaic contains over a million stars and represents the most complete census of stars in  yet obtained .",
    "here we report the first detection of an optical counterpart for a chandra source using the acs data .",
    "the source in question was identified as a possible transient neutron star in quiescence by rutledge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in a spectral analysis of 32 of the brightest sources in the chandra data .",
    "its x - ray spectrum was found to be consistent with thermal emission from a neutron star with a hydrogen atmosphere and inconsistent with several other possible explanations .",
    "the characteristics of the optical counterpart that we have identified suggest the presence of a disk and binary companion , as in a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( qlmxb ) . while more than two dozen qlmxbs have been identified in ten different globular clusters from their x - ray spectra ( heinke et al .",
    "2003b ) , this is only the second optical counterpart found for one of these objects during quiescence ( the other being x5 in 47  tuc ; edmonds et al .",
    "qlmxbs are believed to play an important role in the production of millisecond pulsars ; studying them in globular clusters also holds the promise of new constraints on neutron star equations of state ( brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 , heinke et al .",

    "the x - ray source of interest here lies 45 west of the cluster center . at each of the pointings we obtained 3  340s exposures with the f625w ( 625 ) and f435w ( 435 ) filters and 4  440s exposures with the f658n ( ) filter , shifting the camera between exposures to fill the chip gap . having 3 to 4 exposures per filter enables us to recognize and eliminate false detections and poor measurements caused by cosmic rays .",
    "one short exposure in each of 625  and 435  was also taken to fill out the cluster s horizontal and giant branches .",

    "we cross - checked the optical coordinates using counterparts previously identified in hst / wfpc2 images for two rosat sources in the cluster core , xa and xb .",
    "we recovered stars a and b that carson , cool , and grindlay ( 2000 ) identified as cvs , and confirmed that both are -bright and blue in the acs / wfc images ( haggard et al .",
    "the differences between our optical positions for these two stars and the chandra positions ( table 1 , column 4 ) are well within the 06 uncertainty ( 90% confidence ) in chandra s absolute coordinate system .    noting that the x - ray positions for stars a and b are offset from their optical positions in nearly the same direction , we used them to to improve the placement of the other x - ray sources on the acs mosaic .",
    "we shifted the x - ray positions northwest by ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) = ( @xmath3005 , 030 ) . this shift places star c , identified by carson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as a tentative counterpart of the third rosat core source , xc , just @xmath9r@xmath10 = 006 from the corresponding chandra source position ( table 1 , column 5 ) , confirming that it is the likely source of the x - rays .",
    "star c is -bright but not blue ; it may be either a by dra - type active binary or a cataclysmic variable .",
    "[ fig01 ]    the effect of this boresite correction on the position of the x - ray error circle for the qlmxb is shown in fig",
    ".  1 . the remaining uncertainty in the position of the qlmxb is likely to be dominated by the uncertainty in off - axis @xmath5 positions , 05 at the 45 off - axis angle of the object in the chandra acis - i observation ( feigelson et al .  2002 ) . an additional uncertainty of up to 04 associated with the construction of the acs mosaic and the large separation between the qlmxb and stars a and b may also be present .",
    "we therefore adopted a 1  error circle in the search for its optical counterpart .      in view of the variability of the point spread function ( psf ) in the acs / wfc ( instrument science report acs 2003 - 06 ) , we extracted a 400  400 pixel area ( 20  20 ) approximately centered on the chandra source position from each of the 12 images ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "we selected 10 bright , isolated , unsaturated stars to characterize the psf .",
    "as it demonstrated little or no variability across this small region , we adopted a constant model .",
    "the best results were obtained by making a separate psf for each image .",
    "we obtained a preliminary star list using daophot / find and then examined and compared the images by eye in order to remove cosmic rays and other spurious detections .",
    "we also manually added to the star list near neighbors revealed in the course of psf - fitting .",
    "magnitudes and positions for the 1454 stars identified in this way were then obtained using daophot / allstar for each image independently .",
    "lastly , we matched up stars measured in each of the 10 long exposures , requiring that the positions match to within 1 pixel .",
    "we also analyzed the images using allframe ( stetson 1994 ) , which is designed to use consistent positions for stars in all images .",
    "allstar gave better results , apparently because of the difficulty in transforming star positions between non - aligned exposures with sufficient accuracy , due to the large distortion in the wfc .",

    "it is @xmath11 1.5 magnitudes bluer than the main sequence and noticeably redder than white dwarfs of comparable brightness . in the  diagram ,",
    "the star lies 1.3 magnitudes to the left of the main sequence , suggesting the presence of a strong emission line . despite being so faint",
    ", the star was found in all 10 images by the automated daophot / find routine , making it one of the most reliable detections with 625 @xmath15 25 .",
    "no other star in the 1  error circle is significantly blue or  bright .",
    "we identify this star as the probable optical counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "a finding chart for the proposed optical counterpart is shown in fig.3 .",

    "that the agreement between the optical and x - ray positions improves after the boresite correction further supports the identification of this star as the optical counterpart .",
    "[ fig03 ]    we performed several further tests to check on the reality of this faint object and the reliability of the measured magnitudes .",
    "first , we examined the star visually in each of the ten long - exposure images , and verified that no cosmic rays had affected the photometry . in cmds made from",
    "averaged instead of medianed magnitudes , the star appears in similar locations .",
    "comparable results were also obtained using allframe , which is somewhat less susceptible to contamination of faint star magnitudes by bright neighbors .",
    "this is reassuring , since the candidate has a neighbor just 03 ( 6 pixels ) away that is 5.5 magnitudes brighter in 625  ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we also examined the residuals in the vicinity of the star after subtracting it out of each of the images and found that the subtractions were clean , with no sign of any flux being left behind .",
    "thus the object appears to be stellar .    as a final test",
    ", we computed standard deviations for magnitudes measured in each filter ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "these plots give an indication of the accuracy of the photometry as a function of magnitude and also show that , in all filters , the star is @xmath11 0.5 magnitudes brighter than the faintest stars detected .",
    "the accuracy with which it is measured ( @xmath16 @xmath2 0.2 mag in all filters ) implies that unusual  and  colors are clearly significant . that the star is blue and -bright relative to other stars of comparable 625magnitude",
    "can also be verified visually ( fig .",
    "the star we have identified as the optical counterpart of the qlmxb is faint , blue and -bright .",
    "these characteristics are typical of semi - detached binaries in which a compact object is accreting from a low - mass companion ( e.g. , cool et al .",
    "1998 ) . from the observed 1.3 magnitude  excess and the widths of the f658n and f675w filters ,",
    "we infer the presence of an emission line with an equivalent width of ew ( ) @xmath1 220 , after correcting for the contribution of the line to the flux through the 625  filter .",
    "such a strong line is reminiscent of lines seen in short - orbital - period cataclysmic variables with low accretion rates ( patterson 1984 , tylenda 1981 ) .",
    "comparably strong  emission is also seen in the sxt gro j0422 + 32 , a black hole candidate with p@xmath17 5 hrs ( harlaftis et al.1999 ) .",
    "whereas in principle the neutron star might have been accreting from the cluster interstellar medium ( rutledge et al.2002 ) , the characteristics of the optical counterpart strongly suggest the presence of an accretion disk and a low - mass binary companion .",
    "the object s x - ray to optical flux ratio is high compared to qlmxbs in the field but is on the order of those detected or constrained optically in globular clusters . assuming a @xmath18 color of 0.5 , we estimate  240 for this object .",
    "similar estimates for the two qlmxbs in 47  tuc yield  50 for x5 and a lower limit of  180 for x7 ( the latter based on a limit on the brightness of the optical counterpart ; heinke et al .",
    "2003 , edmonds et al .",
    "our limit on the magnitude of the optical counterpart of the qlmxb in ngc  6397 implies  50 ( grindlay et al.2001 ) .",
    "field qlmxbs aql  x-1 , cen  x-4 and sax  j1808 have  @xmath19 judging from information given by campana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , chevalier et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1999 ) , and homer et al .  ( 2001 ) .",
    "further insight can be gained from the intrinsic color and absolute magnitude of the optical counterpart . adopting a reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.11 ( lub 2002 )",
    ", we derive extinction values of a@xmath20 = 0.45 and a@xmath21 = 0.29 and thus an intrinsic color of ( 435 @xmath3 625)@xmath22 = 1.3 .",
    "this color helps to rule out the possibility raised by rutledge et al .  that the source could be a narrow - line seyfert i galaxy . for a plausible spectrum",
    ", it corresponds to a sloan @xmath23 color of 1.0 , which is redder than 150 such galaxies studied by williams et al .",
    "the high ratio further argues against its being an active galaxy , as agn typically have  values @xmath24 orders of magnitude lower ( e.g. , keokemoer et al .",
    "2004 ) , as does the excess  emission , since a strong line would have to be redshifted into the f658n bandpass by chance .",
    "a measurement of the object s proper motion would help confirm its cluster membership , which would also rule out the possibility that it is a field qlmxb along the line of sight to .",
    "we estimate that a baseline of 5 years would be required to make such a measurement given the faintness of this object and the 6 mas / yr ( 0.1 wfc pixels / yr ) proper motion of .    as a cluster member ,",
    "the star is at 5.0 kpc . using the extinction above",
    ", the distance modulus is then ( m@xmath3m)@xmath21 = 13.8 , yielding an absolute magnitude of 625  = 11.4 . adjusting for the  emission line within the f625w bandpass",
    "gives 625 @xmath1 11.6 for the continuum alone . a @xmath250.5 kpc uncertainty in the distance ( cf .",
    "van leeuwen et al .",
    "2000 vs.  thompson et al .",
    "2001 ) introduces an uncertainty of about @xmath250.2 mag in these values .",
    "this is the faintest optical counterpart detected for a qlmxb .",
    "the only known system that may be fainter is the one in ngc  6397 , for which a limit of @xmath26 @xmath15 11 has been derived from its non - detection in hst / wfpc2 images ( grindlay et al .",
    "the optical counterpart to x5 in 47  tuc and to the field qlmxbs aql  x-1 and cen  x-4 ( @xmath26 = 8.2 , 8.1 , and @xmath27 , respectively ; edmonds et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) are all considerably brighter .",
    "such a faint absolute magnitude implies either that the secondary star is of very low mass or that it is a compact star . in the case of a main - sequence secondary",
    ", we can obtain an upper limit to the mass by assuming that it provides all the light in the 625  band .",
    "for the metallicity of , an absolute magnitude of 625 = 11.6 corresponds to a zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) star with a mass of 0.14(baraffe et al .",
    "such a star would contribute about 20% of the light in the 435  band , leaving a disk with 435 @xmath1 13.1 .",
    "we can not place a lower limit on the mass of the secondary star .",
    "however , the intrinsic color of the system is sufficiently red , despite its location blueward of the main sequence , that it appears likely that at least some , if not all , of the light in the 625  band comes from the secondary . to account for",
    "its color with a power - law spectrum from a disk alone would require a positive exponent : f@xmath28  @xmath29 . a more typical disk spectrum going as @xmath30 would have an intrinsic color of  0.2 and account for only 40% of the light in the 625  band , even if all the 435  flux were from the disk .",
    "the remaining 625-band light could be accounted for by a main - sequence star of mass 0.12 .",
    "the difficulty of accounting for the object s color without a significant contribution from the secondary star argues against the possibility that the secondary is compact .    a main - sequence secondary star mass of @xmath31implies a short orbital period for the system .",
    "in particular , for a zams star in this mass range to fill its roche lobe requires an orbital period of @xmath2 @xmath32 hr ( warner 1995 ) ; longer periods are possible if the star is underdense ( e.g. , edmonds et al.2002 , kaluzny & thompson 2003 ) .",
    "the disk in the system must also be intrinsically very faint , with 435 13 .",
    "this is considerably fainter than even the disk in sax j@xmath33 , a transient with a 2-hr period , whose disk is estimated at m@xmath34 = @xmath35 ( homer et al .",
    "disks this faint are seen in cvs with periods below the period gap , i.e. , @xmath2 2 hrs ( e.g. , sproats et al .",
    "1996 ) , with mass transfer rates of order of 10@xmath36  driven by gravitational radiation ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "that an accreting neutron star , with a potential well a factor of 1000 larger , would have such a faint disk suggests an extremely low rate of accretion onto the neutron star at present , on the order of 10@xmath37 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the rate driven by gravitational radiation , if indeed the system has a short orbital period . a possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be that material is being transferred to the disk from the secondary , but that little , if any , is accreting onto the neutron star from the disk at the present time .",
    "such a picture would fit with the scenario proposed by rutledge et al .",
    ", in which the observed x - ray emission arises from the neutron star itself , and not from present - day accretion . in the brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model , deep crustal heating of the neutron star s core occurs during transient accretion events ; a time - averaged mass transfer rate of 8  10@xmath38 is required to explain the current x - ray luminosity of the neutron star in this system .",
    "we observe no variability in the optical flux ( @xmath2 0.2 mag , 1 @xmath16fig .  4 ) ,",
    "which is also consistent with little or no current accretion onto the neutron star .",
    "however , the constraints we place are limited by the faintness of the star , the small number of exposures in each filter and the short ( 1.5 hr ) time span of the observations .",
    "finally , we note that several other stars of interest appear in the cmd in fig .  2 .",
