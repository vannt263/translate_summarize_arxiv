    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols ( see @xcite for a general survey ) allow two parties , customarily referred to as alice ( @xmath0 ) and bob ( @xmath1 ) , to agree on a shared secret key ( a string of random classical bits ) even in the presence of an all - powerful adversary : eve ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "semi - quantum key distribution ( sqkd ) , first introduced in @xcite , involves the construction of qkd protocols whereby one party ( typically @xmath1 ) is only allowed to measure and prepare qubits in the computational @xmath3 basis ( written here @xmath4 ) . due to this limitation",
    ", @xmath1 is commonly called a `` classical bob '' .",
    "alice , however , is allowed to prepare and measure in either the @xmath3 or @xmath5 basis ( the latter being those states @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "such protocols are of great theoretical interest as they help to ascertain exactly how `` quantum '' a protocol need be in order to gain an advantage over its classical counterpart @xcite .    in more detail ,",
    "an sqkd protocol operates over a two - way quantum communication channel which allows a qubit to travel from @xmath0 , to @xmath1 , then back to @xmath0 ( passing through the adversary @xmath2 twice ) . on each iteration of such a protocol",
    ", @xmath0 prepares a qubit in either the @xmath3 or @xmath5 basis and sends it to @xmath1 who may then perform one of the following actions :    1 .",
    "* measure and resend * : @xmath1 may measure the incoming qubit in the @xmath3 basis recording the result . if his measurement result was @xmath8 ( for @xmath9 ) , he then sends a new qubit : @xmath8 back to @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   * reflect * : alternatively , @xmath1 may simply `` reflect ''",
    "the qubit back to @xmath0 without otherwise disturbing it ( or learning anything about its state ) .",
    "a party limited to the above operations is typically referred to as `` classical '' or `` semi - quantum '' .    after communicating with each other using the quantum channel , @xmath0 and @xmath1 each hold a _ raw key _ which we denote ` info`@xmath10 and",
    "` info`@xmath11 respectively .",
    "it is hoped that these two strings are highly correlated and that an adversary has limited information on either . following the quantum communication stage , error correction ( ec ) and privacy amplification ( pa )",
    "are performed to distill a ( smaller ) secure secret key .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more information on these , now standard , processes .    in this paper",
    "we design a new sqkd protocol which allows two semi - quantum/``classical '' users @xmath0 and @xmath1 to distill a secure key with the help of an untrusted , fully quantum center / server @xmath12 ( see figure [ fig : schematic ] for a diagram of this scenario ) .",
    "such a protocol we call a _ mediated semi - quantum key distribution protocol _ ( it is also a type of _ multi - user quantum key distribution protocol _ - we will use the two terms interchangeably ) . in this scenario ,",
    "@xmath12 will prepare quantum states , and forward them to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 may only reflect or measure in the @xmath3 basis , they must rely on @xmath12 to perform measurements in alternative bases to verify the security of the quantum channel .",
    "we assume , however , that , not only may there be an independent , all - powerful adversary @xmath2 listening on the quantum channel , but also that @xmath12 may be an adversary ( see figure [ fig : schematic ] ) . despite this",
    ", we will show our protocol is unconditionally secure by computing the key - rate of our protocol in the asymptotic scenario @xcite , against an adversarial center and discuss its maximally tolerated error rate . while other semi - quantum protocols have been shown robust @xcite , or secure against individual attacks only @xcite ,",
    "we are not aware of any similar computation yet done for other semi - quantum protocols ( mediated or otherwise ) ; thus our work demonstrates for the first time , that a semi - quantum key distribution protocol may hold comparable security to that of a fully quantum one .     and @xmath1 are the two semi - quantum users who wish to distill a secure secret key known only to themselves .",
    "these two users are connected to an untrusted , fully quantum server , by a two - way quantum channel .",
    "the sever is able to send qubits to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , who may then both return a qubit to the sever .",
    "not only is the server considered to be adversarial in our work , but there may also exist an eavesdropper sitting between one or both of the channels connecting the sever to @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed line connecting the two eavesdroppers in this figure represents a possible connection , either quantum , classical , or physical ( in case they are located in the same physical location - perhaps at a branch point in the quantum channel ) between the eavesdroppers . ]",
    "the first multi - user qkd protocol that we are aware of was developed by phoenix et al . @xcite and it involved the center @xmath12 sending bell states , with one particle sent to each party .",
    "encoding was done by @xmath0 and @xmath1 performing unitary operations on their respective qubits and returning the result to the center , who performed a measurement , informing @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the result .    in @xcite ,",
    "a system was described whereby @xmath0 and @xmath1 send particles , prepared in one of the states @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , to a quantum center who must then store them in a quantum memory until such future time when a secret key is desired .",
    "the protocols of @xcite required the users to measure in both @xmath3 and @xmath5 bases , while the protocols of @xcite require @xmath0 and @xmath1 to apply various unitary operators to the qubits arriving to them from the center .",
    "preparation of bell states was required of both users in the protocol of @xcite ; here the center was used to perform bell measurements ( this protocol was later improved in @xcite forcing the two users to also measure in both bases thus avoiding a security flaw whereby the center was able to learn the key ) . in @xcite (",
    "later improved in @xcite ) , the center was required to prepare states involving the entanglement of four qubits .",
    "furthermore , one of the users was required to perform a bell measurement .    on the semi - quantum side ,",
    "the work most similar to ours are the protocols of @xcite .",
    "the protocol described in @xcite permits a fully quantum @xmath0 to share a key with a series of semi - quantum users @xmath15 .",
    "however , the fully - quantum center @xmath0 is also fully - trusted ( since @xmath0 also desires to share the key with each @xmath16 ) .",
    "the protocol described in @xcite , like our protocol , permits two classical users to distill a secure secret key with the help of an untrusted quantum server ; however it also required the existence of a private quantum channel , which the quantum server could not access ( though , indeed , @xmath2 is allowed access ) , connecting the two users .",
    "denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 the two semi - quantum users who wish to distill a shared , secure secret key , and by @xmath12 the untrusted quantum center / server .",
    "we assume that there is a quantum communication channel connecting @xmath0 to @xmath12 and @xmath1 to @xmath12 .",
    "we also assume there is an authenticated classical channel connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". anyone may listen on this classical channel , however only @xmath0 and @xmath1 may write to it .",
    "there is a classical channel connecting @xmath12 to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "any message that @xmath12 sends to @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) is `` relayed '' by that recipient , over the authenticated channel , to @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath12 can not send different messages to each of the two users without it being known .",
    "whether the channel connecting @xmath12 to the semi - quantum users needs to be authenticated depends on the application . in the next section , where we prove the security of the protocol , we assume that @xmath12 is adversarial",
    "; however we assume , at first , that there are no third party eavesdroppers . in this scenario , there is clearly no need for @xmath12 s messages to be authenticated .",
    "later , we consider the worst case : @xmath12 is adversarial , and there are other , third party eavesdroppers . however , in this case , the third party eavesdroppers attacks ( including any attack which attempts to impersonate @xmath12 on the classical channel and alter his messages ) may be `` absorbed '' into an attack considered in the first case ; thus , our analysis is exactly the same , and there is no need , as far as the `` worst - case '' security bounds we prove are concerned , for the channel from @xmath12 to be authenticated ( the channel between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , however , does need to be authenticated ) .",
    "of course , if the quantum server is , for example , a payed service , then an authenticated channel might be necessary to prevent these third - party attackers from altering @xmath12 s messages ( and indeed a better security bound may be possible in this case as we mention later ) .",
    "note that these issues are not unique to our protocol .",
    "our protocol utilizes the bell basis whose states we denote : @xmath17    we will first describe our protocol assuming a perfectly honest and trustworthy center .",
    "a single iteration @xmath18 of our protocol consists of the following process :    1 .",
    "@xmath12 prepares the bell state @xmath19 .",
    "the center will then send one particle to @xmath0 and the other to @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) will choose randomly to reflect the received qubit , with probability @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , or measure and resend ( with probability @xmath22 ) .",
    "if she ( he ) measures and resends , she ( he ) will save the result as @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "note that @xmath0 and @xmath1 choose independently their action and do not yet disclose their choice .",
    "3 .   @xmath12 will receive both particles from @xmath0 and @xmath1 and will perform a bell measurement . assuming no other noise ,",
    "this measurement should produce either @xmath19 or @xmath25 ( if there is noise , the measurement might alternatively produce one of @xmath26 ) .",
    "she will inform @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the measurement result . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath12 will send to @xmath0 and @xmath1 the message `` @xmath27 '' if the measurement result was @xmath25 and `` @xmath28 '' for any other result .",
    "4 .   @xmath0 and @xmath1 disclose whether they reflected or measured . if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 reflected , they should expect @xmath12 s answer to be `` @xmath28 '' - if they receive `` @xmath27 '' , this round is counted as an error ; if the number of errors exceeds some threshold @xmath29 ( a security parameter set by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 abort .",
    "if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 measured and if @xmath12 reported `` @xmath27 '' , they will keep their raw key bits @xmath30 and @xmath31 , otherwise , if @xmath12 sent `` @xmath28 '' they will disregard this iteration .",
    "note that an iteration is used for the key bit only if @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' ; while decreasing the number of `` useful '' iterations , this turns out to be a vital addition to our protocol .",
    "this process repeats @xmath32 times for @xmath32 sufficiently large .",
    "assuming no noise , it is expected that @xmath33 of these iterations contribute to the final raw key @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( following @xcite , @xmath0 and @xmath1 may set @xmath36 arbitrarily close to @xmath37 ) .",
    "next @xmath0 and @xmath1 will divulge a randomly chosen subset of their measurement results to estimate certain channel statistics ; for example the @xmath3 basis error rate ( next section we discuss the required parameters that must be estimated ) .",
    "following this , @xmath0 and @xmath1 will perform error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "this is done independent of @xmath12 , however we assume that the center can listen in on and utilize this information .",
    "of course the point of our protocol is to operate assuming an untrusted , adversarial center .",
    "such a center @xmath12 we assume will prepare and send any state of his choice in step ( 1 ) ( however , he will send only a single qubit to each party ) .",
    "this includes the possibility of preparing a state entangled with his own private ancilla . also on step ( 3 ) , we allow @xmath12 to perform any operation of his choice ( within the laws of physics of course ) .",
    "this includes the possibility of him keeping , for now , information unmeasured in a private quantum ancilla .",
    "however he must send a message either `` @xmath28 '' or `` @xmath27 '' to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( since anything written on the classical channel is known to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we might as well assume @xmath12 is restricted to sending the same message to both - that is , he can not send `` @xmath28 '' to @xmath0 and `` @xmath27 '' to @xmath1 without being caught ) .",
    "it is @xmath12 s goal to learn the secret key which @xmath0 and @xmath1 eventually distill",
    ".    we will consider _ collective attacks _ in this section .",
    "these are attacks whereby @xmath12 performs the same attack each iteration ; however @xmath12 is free to keep quantum information in his private ancilla for later measurement .",
    "for example , it might be advantageous for @xmath12 to choose an optimal povm after seeing a cipher text , encrypted using @xmath0 and @xmath1 s distilled key after ec and pa .",
    "this is stronger than an _ individual attack _ where @xmath12 is forced to perform his measurement before the key is used for anything .",
    "later , we will show security against _",
    "general attacks _ where @xmath12 is allowed to do anything he likes each iteration ( perhaps altering his attack based on the result of attacking the previous iterations ) . for more information on these attack models , the reader is referred to @xcite . for this section",
    ", we will also assume there is no third party eavesdropper @xmath2 - this scenario will be dealt with in the next section .",
    "we model the center s strategy as follows : first @xmath12 will send not @xmath19 but instead any arbitrary state @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are two - dimensional hilbert spaces used to model the particle sent / transmitted to @xmath0 , respectively @xmath1 ; @xmath41 is @xmath12 s private ancilla which we assume is finite dimensional .",
    "the sent state , which we may assume , without loss of generality , to be pure , may be written as :    @xmath42    here , each @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we may assume that each @xmath45 is normalized , though they are not necessarily orthogonal .",
    "next , after @xmath0 and @xmath1 perform their operations and return the qubits to @xmath12 , we permit @xmath12 to perform any quantum operation on the returned state . since he must also report a single bit of classical information , we model this as a _ quantum instrument _",
    "@xcite @xmath46 such that for any density matrix @xmath47 acting on @xmath48 :    @xmath49 under the condition that : @xmath50 in our case , we may assume @xmath51 and @xmath52 are both finite .",
    "note we have expanded the underlying hilbert space , adding the subspace @xmath53 : a two dimensional subspace spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath54 .",
    "this is used to model the classical message @xmath12 sends to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( either `` @xmath28 '' or `` @xmath27 '' ) .",
    "since we assume @xmath12 is forced to send the same message to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( e.g. , he can not send `` @xmath28 '' to @xmath0 and `` @xmath27 '' to @xmath1 ) , this is sufficient .",
    "our first claim is that @xmath12 may , without any loss of power , send not @xmath55 as described above ( equation [ eq : start - entangled ] ) , but instead the far simpler state : @xmath56 .",
    "that is , @xmath12 need not entangle the start state with his ancilla at first .",
    "this is similar to a result , concerning the security of single state semi - quantum protocols ( not mediated ones ) , first presented in @xcite ( lemma 2.1 ) ; and , indeed , we use a similar technique for the proof in this subsection .",
    "assume @xmath12 sends the entangled state @xmath55 .",
    "then , when he receives a reply from both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the system is in the mixed state :    @xmath57 where @xmath36 is the probability that one or both of @xmath0 and @xmath1 measured and resent . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath12 simply sends @xmath58 , the resulting state is :    @xmath59    above , we have assumed , without loss of generality , that @xmath12 s ancilla is cleared to some zero state @xmath60 .",
    "define @xmath61 to be a unitary operator such that @xmath62 .",
    "this may be done unitarily and it is clear that @xmath63 .",
    "thus any arbitrary , entangled state @xmath55 which @xmath12 may desire to send at the start may be `` recreated '' later without any loss to @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , when analyzing the security of this protocol , we need only consider @xmath12 sending @xmath58 - @xmath12 may then absorb @xmath61 into his attack @xmath46 .",
    "as such , we will forgo writing the `` prime '' .",
    "next , using standard techniques ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , we may represent @xmath12 s quantum instrument as a unitary operator acting on a larger hilbert space .",
    "that is , instead of applying @xmath46 on the returned state , @xmath12 will apply a unitary operator @xmath64 followed by a projective measurement on the @xmath53 subspace .",
    "define @xmath65 as follows :    @xmath66    it is clear that this is an isometry mapping @xmath67 where @xmath68 is spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath69 and @xmath70 is spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath71 . that this is",
    "an isometry is clear :    @xmath72    it is also clear that , given @xmath73 , then @xmath74 ( this is also the case for any mixed state due to linearity ) .",
    "we may assume that @xmath12 has access to @xmath75 ( this can only add to @xmath12 s power ) .",
    "furthermore , we may assume without loss of generality that when @xmath12 receives a state @xmath73 from @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( after they performed their operations ) , that the complete quantum state which @xmath12 then holds is @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is some arbitrary , normalized , zero state in @xmath53 , the choice of which is irrelevant ) .",
    "finally , @xmath65 may be extended to a unitary operator @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 in a straight - forward manner ( its action on states @xmath80 for @xmath81 is irrelevant ) .",
    "thus :    @xmath82 and so we may therefore safely consider only unitary operators when discussing @xmath12 s attack .",
    "the result of @xmath12 sending the classical message `` @xmath28 '' is equivalent to projecting the @xmath53 portion of the resulting state ( after applying @xmath83 ) to @xmath84 ; similarly for sending `` @xmath27 '' .",
    "thus @xmath12 s choice / decision as to what message to send , followed by the resulting state of his quantum system , is simply modeled by a projective measurement of the @xmath53 subspace in the @xmath54 basis .",
    "furthermore , we will simply `` absorb '' the auxiliary spaces @xmath85 into @xmath41 from this point forward .",
    "we may now consider the key rate of our protocol in the asymptotic scenario @xcite .",
    "that is , after completing @xmath86 successful iterations of our protocol ( those iterations where @xmath0 and @xmath1 both measure and @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' - thus they each have an ` info ` string / raw key of @xmath86 bits ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 will , as is usual with qkd protocols , perform an error correcting ( ec ) routine followed by privacy amplification ( pa ) to distill a secure secret key of size @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath88 depends on the amount of information @xmath12 may hold on the key . the key rate , then , is defined as :    @xmath89    under collective attacks , one may model the conclusion of @xmath86 successful iterations of our protocol , before ec and pa , with the following density matrix :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the probability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 s raw key being @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively , while @xmath94 is the state of @xmath12 s ancilla in this event .    using this terminology , we may bound the key - rate @xmath95 using devetak - winter s equation @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the quantum mutual information held between @xmath0 and @xmath12 ( here we use @xmath98 to denote the von neumann entropy ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath99 is the mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , though this computation uses the classical shannon entropy function ; that is @xmath100 . for the states in question , namely those of the form described by equation [ eq : cqq - state ] ,",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath101 ; note that here we have traced out @xmath1 from the original state .",
    "see ref @xcite for more details",
    ". observe , however , that if @xmath102 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 may , after ec and pa , distill a secure secret key .    after a particular run of a qkd protocol",
    ", the quantity @xmath99 is easily computed ; the difficulty lies in the computation of @xmath103 . of course",
    ", if @xmath0 and @xmath1 have access only to certain statistics and not the entire attack description ( that is , they observe certain probabilities of various events , but they do not know the actual attack operator @xmath64 that was employed against them and thus can not explicitly construct equation [ eq : cqq - state ] ) , the problem is exacerbated .",
    "however , they may estimate the key rate : @xmath104 where the supremum is taken over all possible attack operators @xmath12 may employ , which conform the observed statistics @xcite . computing an upper - bound for @xmath103 will be our goal in the next subsection .      given a matrix @xmath0 ,",
    "we denote its trace norm by @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an @xmath106 hermitian matrix and @xmath107 are the eigenvalues of @xmath0 , then @xmath108 . an important result , which we will utilize later ,",
    "was shown in @xcite which upper - bounds the quantity :    @xmath109    in our case , this implies :    @xmath110    before continuing , we will require a small lemma which , though fairly trivial , we include for completeness .",
    "[ lemma : eigenvalues ] let @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are arbitrary elements of a @xmath114-dimensional hilbert space @xmath48 ( @xmath115 ) such that @xmath116 .",
    "then : @xmath117    note that @xmath47 is hermitian and so its trace norm is simply the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues",
    ". we may write @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , it holds that @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( here , if @xmath126 we use @xmath127 to denote the conjugate of @xmath128 ) .",
    "note that @xmath129 .",
    "recall that the trace norm is invariant under unitary changes of basis ( i.e. @xmath130 ) .",
    "thus , choosing a suitable basis , the first two entries of which are @xmath131 , we may write : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a @xmath134 matrix : @xmath135    we see now there are at most two non - zero eigenvalues : they are @xmath136 . thus :    @xmath137    the inequality follows from the fact that both @xmath138 and @xmath139 are non - negative .",
    "we now return to our protocol .",
    "let @xmath140 be the probability that @xmath0 and @xmath1 measure @xmath141 .",
    "this is a statistic which may be estimated and , as in @xcite ( where the security of the b92 @xcite protocol was being proved ) , we may assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 abort if @xmath142 or @xmath143 .",

    "that is , if @xmath12 sends the state @xmath47 , the joint state , as it arrives to @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath186 ; likewise , if the joint state leaving @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath133 , the state arriving at @xmath12 is @xmath187 .",

    "also , this scenario fits our first requirement for a `` symmetric '' attack which was the assumption used last section .",
    "next , assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 both reflect .",

    "recall that @xmath183 is simply the probability that @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' if the state of the joint system , when it leaves @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is @xmath205 . after receiving a state from @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which passed through the depolarization channel with parameter @xmath185",
    ", @xmath12 applies a ( limited ) attack operator .",
    "since he is semi - honest this attack , along with the effects of the depolarization channel , leaves us with the following identities :    @xmath206    as in equation [ eq : c - attack ] , we have written the effects of the attack and depolarization channels with respect to the bell basis . here",
    "@xmath207 is a trace one density matrix representing the state of @xmath12 s system in the event he sends ",
    "@xmath208 if the joint state leaving @xmath0 and @xmath1 were to be @xmath205 .",
    "thus , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 for all other @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "since @xmath184 and @xmath185 are both parameters that @xmath0 and @xmath1 may estimate , they may , if they assume this attack model , estimate @xmath183 .",
    "furthermore , the reader may readily verify by performing the same computation above for the case when the state leaving @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath213 for @xmath214 , that the probability of @xmath12 sending `` @xmath27 '' in the event both @xmath0 and @xmath1 measure @xmath157 is equal to the probability of the same message being sent in case @xmath0 and @xmath1 both measure @xmath37 ; this probability is simply @xmath215 . similarly for the probability of @xmath12 sending `` @xmath27 '' in the event @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurements differ ; that probability being @xmath216 .",
    "clearly this scenario fits the symmetry assumptions we made in the last section ; thus these assumptions do not penalize a server running the protocol honestly in the presence of channel noise .",
    "furthermore , we may apply our main security theorem .",
    "indeed , the above is enough to compute an upper - bound of @xmath103 using theorem [ thm : main ] ; however we still need to compute @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath217 be the probability that @xmath0 s measurement result is different from @xmath1 , given that @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' ( this may be different from @xmath218 . clearly this value is :    @xmath219    which in this example is : @xmath220    it is not difficult to show that @xmath221 providing us with enough information now to estimate the key rate @xmath95 .",
    "for example , if @xmath222 ( that is the noise in the forward channel is the same as the noise in the reverse ) , our protocol maintains a positive key rate for @xmath223 . see figure [ fig : honest - bound ] .",
    "this tolerated noise level is much higher than bb84 ( which can withstand up to @xmath224 noise without preprocessing @xcite before the key - rate drops to zero ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : honest - bound - error ] , which plots the values of @xmath202 , @xmath225 , and @xmath217 as @xmath146 ( and thus @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) increase , we see the main reason : @xmath217 is very small due to @xmath12 `` throwing out '' almost all iterations when @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurement results differ ( there are of course some iterations when they are not thrown out due to the noise in the return channel ) .",
    "thus @xmath99 remains large - i.e. , there is little information leaked during error correction .",
    "we now consider the worst - case scenario , where all noise is induced by @xmath12 s attack and that @xmath12 himself is fully adversarial .",
    "let @xmath226 , for @xmath43 , be the initial state sent from @xmath12 on step 1 of the protocol .",
    "since we restrict our attention to symmetric attacks , it is required that @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "we claim that , without any loss of power to @xmath12 , we may consider , instead , the joint state of the system arriving at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to be : @xmath229 . since in this worst - case scenario",
    "we are assuming all noise is due to @xmath12 s attack , we assume that this is the state that @xmath12 initially prepares in step ( 1 ) of the protocol .",
    "indeed , assume @xmath12 sends the original state @xmath55 . since we assume the worst - case that all noise is from @xmath12 s attack , the state of the system arriving back at @xmath12 , after @xmath0 and @xmath1 s operation , is the mixed state :    @xmath230    where @xmath231 is the probability that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 reflect and @xmath232 .",
    "if , however , @xmath12 sends @xmath233 , the state of the joint system after @xmath0 and @xmath1 s operation is :    @xmath234    let @xmath235 with @xmath236 if @xmath237 ; otherwise @xmath238 .",
    "then , @xmath239 is a unitary operator and @xmath240 .",
    "thus , if there were an advantage to sending the state @xmath55 in step 1 , @xmath12 may simply send @xmath241 initially and apply the operator @xmath61 later when the system returns to him , all without any loss of power or advantage to @xmath12 .",
    "we may therefore assume @xmath12 sends the state @xmath241 initially .",
    "let @xmath64 be @xmath12 s unitary attack operator ( equation [ eq : c - attack ] ) .",
    "then , by linearity : @xmath242    denote by @xmath202 the probability that @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' in the event that @xmath0 and @xmath1 both reflect . from the above ,",
    "this value is : @xmath243 clearly , if @xmath146 and @xmath202 are both small , then so must be @xmath244 .",
    "if we upper - bound this value , we attain an upper - bound on @xmath103 using theorem [ thm : main ] , thus lower - bounding the key rate .",
    "of course we must bound this value based on statistics which @xmath0 and @xmath1 may measure . in particular , we will use this value @xmath202 .",
    "let @xmath245 where @xmath246 and , without loss of generality , @xmath247 ( any different phase may be absorbed into @xmath248 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath249 .",
    "write @xmath250 with @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 , assumptions we may make without any loss of generality .",
    "this of course implies that @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "using this notation , @xmath202 ( equation [ eq : pw ] ) becomes :    @xmath256    solving for @xmath92 and taking the larger solution , we find :    @xmath257    it is trivial to show that this function is maximal when @xmath258 , @xmath259 ( note that @xmath93 can be no larger than this ) , and @xmath260 yielding : @xmath261    thus , using equation [ eq : f0bound - large ] with equation [ eq : second - bound ] from theorem [ thm : main ] , the key rate bounded by :    @xmath262    where , as before , @xmath217 is the probability that @xmath0 s measurement result is different from @xmath1 s in the event @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' .",
    "the values @xmath217 , @xmath146 , @xmath202 , and @xmath225 may all be estimated by @xmath0 and @xmath1 without difficulty .",
    "so long as @xmath102 , a secure secret key may be distilled .",
    "figure [ fig : bound26 ] show graphs of this bound as a function of @xmath146 assuming @xmath263 .",
    "in particular , we observe that , if @xmath264 and @xmath265 , our protocol maintains a positive key - rate for @xmath266 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath0 and @xmath1 may estimate the value of @xmath267 and @xmath268 by estimating the probability that @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' given that @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurement results differ . indeed , call this probability @xmath269 then , using our symmetry assumptions and the fact that @xmath270 for any @xmath92 : @xmath271 similarly for @xmath268 .",
    "for instance , if both @xmath267 and @xmath268 are less than or equal to @xmath146 ( considering our analysis in the depolarization scenario above , where @xmath272 assuming @xmath222 , this seems a reasonable assumption ) , then , using equation [ eq : first - bound ] with @xmath273 gives us a key rate of : @xmath274 figure [ fig : bound27 ] shows a graph of this key rate bound when @xmath275 ( from equation [ eq : qz ] , this produces an upper - bound for @xmath276 assuming @xmath277 ) .",
    "we see here , the key rate is positive so long as @xmath278 when @xmath265 ; the key rate is positive for @xmath279 when @xmath280 ( the smallest value of @xmath225 we observed in the depolarization scenario above ) .",
    "compare these results with bb84 as already mentioned ; also the three state bb84 protocol , which supports a maximal error rate of @xmath281 @xcite , and b92 @xcite which maintains a positive key rate for @xmath282 ( assuming no preprocessing ) @xcite .",
    "observe that , as @xmath225 drops , we do not take into account the necessary drop in the values @xmath183 . in practice , the user may better bound these values using equation [ eq : pra ] and also the values @xmath283 and @xmath284 ( the latter being the probability that @xmath12 sends `` @xmath27 '' given that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurement result is the same ) .",
    "then , perhaps using numerical optimization , the user may produce a more accurate key rate value .",
    "our bounds that we described above are exact equations , and are `` worst - case '' ( the key rate can only be higher or equal to the values we found ) .",
    "however , even with @xmath280 , using our lower - bounds , the key rate is positive for @xmath279 which is superior to b92 and three state bb84 , and so we are content to leave our analysis at that . there may be future work in deriving a better lower bound for the key rate taking better account of @xmath225 .",
    "in the previous section we considered only collective attacks . however , @xmath0 and @xmath1 may symmetrize their raw key by permuting it using a permutation chosen publicly by @xmath0 . as shown in @xcite , for such permutation invariant protocols , to prove security against general attacks , it is sufficient to consider only collective attacks .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic scenario , our security key rate bound derived last section applies even against any possible general attack the adversarial sever may perform .",
    "finally , it is evident that any attack a third - party eavesdropper may perform , may also be `` absorbed '' into the server s attack operator @xmath64 ( including an attack whereby @xmath2 sends a message on the classical channel , impersonating @xmath12 - for example , such an impersonation attack will only lead to more noise in the @xmath202 parameter , and/or less accepted iterations ) . thus the lower bound on the key rate from theorem [ thm : main ] applies even in this case . note",
    "that , if we trust the server to be `` semi - honest '' , and if we model the third party eavesdropper s attack via a depolarization channel ( as was done when analyzing the key rate of b92 @xcite ) , then we may use our analysis above to show our protocol maintains a positive key rate so long as @xmath285 ( though in this case , an authenticated channel should be used by @xmath12 so that @xmath2 can not alter the message ) .",
    "we have designed a new mediated semi - quantum protocol and proven that it may hold equivalent security guarantees to that of a fully quantum qkd protocol . indeed , even in the worst case , our protocol can suffer an amount of noise comparable to fully quantum protocols , before the adversary holds too much information that the users must abort .",
    "there are many questions that might provide fruitful future work .",
    "for instance , it would be nice to improve theorem [ thm : main ] to take into better account the factor @xmath225 ; our bound is a `` worst - case '' solution - but there might be improvements here .    from a practical standpoint ,",
    "there are several issues .",
    "in particular , it would be better to design a single - qubit version of this protocol so that bell states are not required .",
    "it is not difficult to do so if we allow the qubit to travel from @xmath12 to @xmath0 , back to @xmath12 , to @xmath1 , and then return to @xmath12 .",
    "if the qubit sent from @xmath12 initially was @xmath286 , our protocol should work similarly ( now @xmath12 measuring in the @xmath5 basis and sending `` @xmath27 '' if he reads @xmath14 ) .",
    "however the security analysis is more difficult in this setting as the qubit passes through @xmath12 twice ; in this case it would seem our trick of delaying an entanglement attack ( section 4.1 ) no longer holds on the second pass .     and @xmath185 respectively .",
    "the key rate is plotted as a function of @xmath287 : the error rate of @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurement results . in this graph , we assume @xmath222 ; that is the noise in both directions is equal .",

    "this is because the quantum server is `` throwing out '' most iterations where their measurement results differ .",
