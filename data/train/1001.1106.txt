    "one of forney s seminal contributions to algebraic coding was the invention of _ generalized minimum distance ( gmd ) _ decoding @xcite .",
    "it provides a means to exploit soft information from the channel using a hard  decision algebraic decoder by multi  trial error / erasure decoding with a varying number of erased unreliable input symbols .",
    "most intriguing about the gmd scheme is that it performs as good as _ maximum likelihood ( ml ) _ decoding if the channel is good .",
    "this gives rise to the frequent application of gmd decoding for concatenated codes .",
    "there , the inner code is responsible for correcting a considerable amount of transmission channel errors .",
    "thus , the input symbols for the outer decoder can be viewed as being transmitted over a _ super channel _ , which is composed of the transmission channel and the inner decoder .",
    "this super channel is always good if the parameters of the inner code are chosen appropriately .",
    "any decoder s performance can be measured by its guaranteed decoding radius and its residual codeword error probability , the latter one being a function of the channel .",
    "the fundamental research problem of threshold  based multi ",
    "trial decoding is to find for @xmath8 the set of thresholds @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which optimizes the respective performance measure .",
    "generally , the output of multi  trial decoding is a result list . in this paper , we denote the case that the transmitted codeword is among the elements of the result list as a _ decoding success_. both the decoding radius and the residual codeword error probability are to be understood in this context .",
    "maximization of the guaranteed decoding radius of gmd decoding for concatenated codes was considered by blokh and zyablov @xcite .",
    "using linear programming , they obtained optimal threshold sets when both inner and outer code are bmd  decoded . in previous work @xcite , we generalized their result to the case where the outer code is _ @xmath11extended bounded distance ( @xmath11bd)_decoded for the full ( real ) range @xmath12 .",
    "blokh and zyablov also considered the probably more practical performance measure , i.e. minimization of the residual codeword error rate .",
    "for concatenated codes with inner ml and outer bmd decoding they derived optimal threshold sets using results on the _ binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) _ error exponent from gallager @xcite and forney @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we tackle the generalization to the case of an outer _",
    "@xmath0extended bounded distance ( @xmath0bd ) _ decoder , building up on our previous results @xcite .",

    "trial decoding of concatenated codes , in section  [ sec : conditions ] , we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal threshold set .",
    "we do this on a high level , using the error- and erasure probabilities for each threshold pair @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 as parameters . in section  [ sec : exp ] , we recall forney s generalization of gallager s error exponent of the bsc channel in the error / erasure decoding case",
    ". simple approximations of the error- and erasure probabilities are derived in section  [ sec : approx ] .",

    "a concatenated code @xmath16 consists of two constituent codes @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we denote @xmath19 as the _ inner _ code , @xmath20 as the _ outer _ code and @xmath21 as the _ concatenated _ code .",
    "since @xmath19 is binary , such is @xmath21 .",
    "w.l.o.g . we restrict ourselves to this most practical case .",
    "an information vector @xmath22 is first encoded into a codeword @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24ary symbols @xmath25 , @xmath26 , of @xmath27 are then converted into binary vectors @xmath28 and encoded into @xmath29 .",
    "the binary matrix consisting of the @xmath30 is then transmitted over a bsc channel with crossover probability @xmath31 .    at the receiver ,",
    "erroneous vectors @xmath32 are received .",
    "they are fed into an ml decoder @xmath33 for @xmath19.the resulting codeword estimates @xmath34 are mapped to their information vectors @xmath35 and converted into symbols @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the erasure symbol .",
    "the vector @xmath38 and the number @xmath8 of thresholds are the input for the gmd decoder of @xmath20 .    inside the gmd decoder , @xmath39 is processed in the following way .",
    "first , for every symbol @xmath40 , the _ reliability value _ @xmath41 , @xmath42 is calculated .",
    "then , the threshold set @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is applied as @xmath43 resulting in an _ input list _ @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "thus , a decoding result of the inner decoder is discarded in decoding trial @xmath46 , @xmath47 , if its reliability value falls below the threshold @xmath13 .",
    "finally , an error / erasure @xmath11bd decoder ( in our case @xmath48 ) is applied to every element of @xmath49 resulting in a _",
    "result list _ @xmath50 .",
    "whenever @xmath51 we have a decoding success .",
    "this section generalizes our result from @xcite which was obtained for the simple case where the inner code is bpsk modulation and the outer @xmath0bd decoder has parameter @xmath6 , i.e. it is a bmd decoder .    considering ( [ eqn : erase ] ) , it is clear that two cases can occur while advancing from threshold @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "first , it is possible that a correct symbol from the super channel is erased for @xmath14 while it was not for @xmath13 .",
    "second , it is possible that a wrong symbol is erased for @xmath14 while it was not for @xmath13 .",
    "the probabilities for these two cases are defined by @xmath52 @xmath15 .",
    "additionally , we define @xmath53 for the three border cases",
    ". we shall find useful approximations for these probabilities in section  [ sec : approx ] .",
    "note , that @xmath54 .    with each of the probabilities we associate the number of symbols from @xmath39 falling into the case , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "obviously , @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 and @xmath58 be the numbers of erroneous and erased symbols , respectively , in @xmath59 .",
    "an @xmath0bd decoder for @xmath20 succeeds in decoding @xmath59 as long as @xmath60 this inequality can be expressed by @xmath55 as @xmath61 since it follows from ( [ eqn : erase ] ) and the orderliness of the threshold set that a symbol is erased by @xmath62 if it is erased by @xmath13 .",
    "unequality ( [ eqn : success2 ] ) is then obtained by simply counting all symbols which are errors and erasures , respectively , for decoding trial @xmath46 and replacing @xmath57 and @xmath58 in ( [ eqn : success1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath63\\hspace{-1.5mm}.\\ ] ] then , by @xmath64 we obtain an exact formula for the residual codeword error probability of the gmd decoder with @xmath65 .",
    "we can replace the condition by @xmath66\\hspace{-1.5mm}.\\ ] ] to obtain a good approximation of @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "condition @xmath69 can be compressed to @xmath70,\\ ] ] if we consider @xmath71 .",
    "the latter set of equalities can be seen by subtracting two subsequent equations of @xmath69 from each other .",
    "since the super channel can be assumed to be good , we can further approximate @xmath67 by @xmath72    the previous observations allow to prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : conditions ] the following conditions are necessary and sufficient for an optimal threshold set @xmath9 , which minimizes the residual codeword error rate @xmath67 . @xmath73 and @xmath74    equivalent to the maximization in ( [ eqn : peapprox1 ] ) , we can also express the approximation for @xmath67 in logarithmic form , i.e. @xmath75 then , the maximization term is a linear function of the @xmath76 .",
    "thus , its maximum is attained at some boundary point fulfilling condition @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 in non  logarithmic form : @xmath79 let @xmath80 fulfill the statement of the theorem and let @xmath81 be a set of thresholds where at least one threshold is different than in @xmath80 .",
    "assume that @xmath81 is optimal .",
    "the only possible way for @xmath81 to achieve a smaller @xmath67 would be to decrease all terms in ( [ eqn : peapprox2 ] ) simultaneously .",
    "this is impossible , decreasing any of the probabilities @xmath82 would increase at least one of the others .",
    "this proves that @xmath80 is both unique and optimal .",
    "let us for a while consider one specific decoding trial @xmath46 , @xmath83 and the corresponding threshold @xmath84 .",
    "reliability values are calculated according to ( [ eqn : rel ] ) and thresholds are applied as in ( [ eqn : erase ] ) .",
    "hence , by erasing , the inner ml decoder becomes a decoder with erasing option .",

    "in this section , we shall find simple approximations for the probabilities @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , which were defined in section  [ sec : conditions ] .",
    "the approximations are required to obtain an analytic threshold location formula fulfilling the necessary and sufficient conditions of theorem  [ thm : conditions ] .",
    "let us start with the following observation .",
    "with gallager s exponent , the error probability of an ml decoder is @xmath92 . for such decoding",
    ", there exists a hamming distance radius @xmath93 such that decoding of @xmath94 with @xmath95 almost always succeeds and decoding of @xmath94 with @xmath96 almost always yields an erroneous result .",
    "this radius can be thought of as an approximation of the borders of the voronoi cells of @xmath97 . for decoding with erasure option as in ( [ eqn :",
    "criterion ] ) and the error exponents from ( [ eqn : pe ] ) and ( [ eqn : px ] ) this gives the following approximations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "recall , that @xmath31 is the crossover probability of the bsc .",
    "@xmath100 @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 , we also have @xmath103 . of course , the probabilities and radii vary for different thresholds . hence , we append the threshold index as a parameter , i.e. we denote the probabilities and radii for @xmath47 by @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "note , that from @xmath10 follows @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "let us consider the probability @xmath108 for a symbol , which is erased for each threshold from @xmath80 .",
    "its hamming distance to the transmitted codeword must be at least @xmath109 and at most @xmath110 .",
    "otherwise , there would be a threshold for which the symbol would not be erased .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath111    now , let us approximate the probability @xmath91 for a wrong symbol which is never erased .",
    "its hamming distance to the transmitted codeword must be at least @xmath112 .",
    "we obtain @xmath113    the probabilities @xmath114 , @xmath15 , can be approximated as follows .",
    "symbols counting towards @xmath115 must lie between @xmath116 and @xmath117 as can be seen in figure  [ fig : radii ] .",
    "for @xmath118 we observe that the symbols must lie between @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",

    "after some rather technical simplifications , this yields the following simple expressions .",
    "[ lemma : approx ] the probabilities @xmath125 and @xmath118 can be approximated by @xmath126 @xmath15 .",

    "let us express the equations using the approximated probabilities from lemma  [ lemma : approx ] .",
    "for ( [ eqn : condition1 ] ) , this gives @xmath128 we express ( [ eqn : condition2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : condition3 ] ) in the same way and obtain @xmath129 and , @xmath130 , @xmath131    [ thm : locationbd ] the optimal threshold set @xmath9 for gmd decoding of a concatenated code , with inner ml and outer @xmath132bd decoding , @xmath133 , is given by @xmath134 where @xmath87 is gallager s error exponent for the bsc and @xmath88 is the corresponding optimization parameter , @xmath135 .",
