    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions @xcite of the standard model predict the existence of the bosonic partners of all known fermions .",
    "the scalar top quark  ( @xmath50 ) , which is the bosonic partner of the top quark , can be the lightest charged supersymmetric particle for the following two reasons  @xcite .",
    "firstly , one - loop radiative corrections to the @xmath50 mass through higgsino - quark loops and higgs - squark loops are always negative .",
    "the correction is large for a heavy top quark mass as measured by the cdf and d0 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the supersymmetric partners of the right - handed and left - handed top quarks ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) mix , and the resultant two mass eigenstates ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) have a mass splitting .",
    "this mass splitting is expected to be very large due to the large top quark mass .",
    "it is possible that the lighter mass eigenstate ( @xmath53 ) can be lighter than any other charged susy particle , and also lighter than the top quark itself .",
    "the @xmath53 is the mixed state of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , _ i.e. _ @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a mixing angle .",
    "all susy breaking parameters @xcite are hidden in the @xmath56 and a mass of @xmath53",
    ".    the scalar bottom quark ( @xmath57 ) can also be light if @xmath58 , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , is larger than approximately 40 . in this case ,",
    "analogous mixing between the supersymmetric partners of the right- and left - handed states of the bottom quark ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) becomes large , and the resultant two mass eigenstates ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) also have a large mass splitting  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the lighter mass eigenstate ( @xmath61 ) may therefore be within the reach of lep2 .",
    "scalar top quark pairs and scalar bottom quark pairs are produced in @xmath63 annihilation via a virtual @xmath2 boson or a virtual photon . in this paper",
    "it is assumed that r - parity  @xcite is conserved and that either @xmath64 or @xmath65 is the only susy particle which is lighter than @xmath53 ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath64 is the lightest neutralino and @xmath65 is the scalar neutrino . the dominant decay mode of the @xmath53 with the above assumptions is expected to be either @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "both of these decay modes have been searched for .",
    "the dominant decay mode of the @xmath61 is expected to be @xmath68 . under the assumption of r - parity conservation ,",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 are invisible in the detector .",
    "thus , @xmath69 and @xmath70 events are characterised by two acoplanar jets or two acoplanar jets plus two leptons , with missing energy .",
    "the d0 collaboration has reported a lower limit  @xcite on the @xmath53 mass of about 85  gev ( 95% c.l . ) for the case of @xmath66 and that the mass difference between @xmath53 and @xmath64 is larger than about 35  gev .",
    "searches at @xmath63 colliders are sensitive to a smaller mass difference and mass limits for the @xmath53 have been obtained around the @xmath2 peak ( lep1 ) assuming @xmath66 . a 95% c.l .",
    "lower limit of about 45  gev was obtained for a mass difference larger than 5  gev  @xcite .",
    "previous searches at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath3= 130 , 136  @xcite , 161  @xcite and 171  gev  @xcite improved the limit on the mass of the @xmath53 to 66.8  gev if the @xmath56 is smaller than @xmath71 and if the mass difference between @xmath53 and @xmath64 is larger than 10  gev .    in 1997 the lep @xmath63 collider at cern was run at centre - of - mass energies of 181184  gev .",
    "the luminosity weighted mean centre - of - mass energy was 182.7  gev . in this paper direct searches for @xmath53 and @xmath61 using the data collected with the opal detector at these centre - of - mass energies are reported .",
    "the results shown here have been obtained by combining the results obtained at these new centre - of - mass energies with those obtained at @xmath3 = 130 , 136 , 161 and 171  gev @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the production and decay of the @xmath53 ( @xmath61 ) is described in section 2 of the previous publication  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the opal detector and the event simulation for signal and background processes are given in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the data analysis is described and the results are given in section 4 .",
    "the opal detector , which is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , is a multipurpose apparatus having nearly complete solid angle coverage .",
    "the central detector consists of a silicon strip detector and tracking chambers , providing charged particle tracking for over 96% of the full solid angle , inside a uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 0.435  t. a lead - glass electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter located outside the magnet coil is hermetic in the polar angle - axis points to the centre of the lep ring , and positive @xmath72 is along the electron beam direction .",
    "the angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively . ]",
    "range of @xmath75 for the barrel region and @xmath76 for the endcap region .",
    "the magnet return yoke consisting of barrel and endcap sections along with pole tips is instrumented for hadron calorimetry ( hcal ) in the region @xmath77 .",
    "four layers of muon chambers cover the outside of the hadron calorimeter .",
    "calorimeters close to the beam axis measure the luminosity using small angle bhabha scattering events and complete the geometrical acceptance down to 24 mrad .",
    "these include the forward detectors ( fd ) which are lead - scintillator sandwich calorimeters and , at smaller angles , silicon tungsten calorimeters ( sw )  @xcite located on both sides of the interaction point .",
    "tungsten shields were installed around the beam pipe in front of the sw detectors to reduce the amount of synchrotron radiation seen by the detector .",
    "the presence of the shield results in a gap in the sw acceptance between the polar angles of 28 and 31  mrad .",
    "the gap between the endcap em calorimeter and the fd is filled by an additional lead - scintillator electromagnetic calorimeter , called the gamma - catcher .",
    "monte carlo simulation of the production and decay of the @xmath53 was performed as follows  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath69 pairs were generated taking into account initial - state radiation  @xcite .",
    "the hadronisation process was subsequently performed to produce colourless @xmath53-hadrons and other fragmentation products according to the lund string fragmentation scheme ( jetset 7.4 )  @xcite .",
    "the parameters for perturbative qcd and fragmentation processes were optimised using event shape distributions of the hadronic @xmath2 decays measured by opal  @xcite . for the fragmentation of the @xmath53 , the fragmentation function proposed by peterson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was used , where the parameter @xmath78 was set to @xmath79    the @xmath53-hadron was formed from a @xmath53-quark and a spectator anti - quark or diquark @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation products excluding the @xmath53-hadrons carry less than 2% of the centre - of - mass energy . for the @xmath53 decaying into @xmath80",
    ", a colour string was stretched between the charm quark and the spectator .",
    "this colour singlet system was hadronised using the lund scheme  @xcite .",
    "gluon bremsstrahlung ( qcd parton showering ) was allowed in this process , and the peterson function was also used for the charm quark fragmentation , where @xmath81 was set to 0.031  @xcite .",
    "the signals for the decays @xmath82 and @xmath83 were simulated in a similar manner .",
    "one thousand events were generated at each of 56 combinations of @xmath84 for @xmath85 , 40 combinations of @xmath86 for @xmath87 and 40 combinations of @xmath86 for @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath70 events were generated for 48 combinations of @xmath89 .",
    "the mixing angles of the @xmath53 and @xmath61 were set to zero when these events were generated .",
    "the dependence of the detection efficiencies on these mixing angles will be discussed in section  4.1 .",
    "the generated events were processed through the full simulation of the opal detector  @xcite , and the same event analysis chain was applied to the simulated events and the data .",
    "the background processes were simulated as follows :    @xmath90 multijet hadronic events @xmath91 in which one or two jet momenta are mismeasured are a background for the large @xmath92 region ( @xmath93 , or @xmath94 ) .",
    "the pythia  @xcite generator was used to simulate hadronic events .",
    "@xmath90 @xmath95 pairs , in which one of the @xmath95 lepton decays into a low momentum electron and energetic neutrinos , are a background to acoplanar two - jet events .",
    "the koralz event generator  @xcite was used for the generation of @xmath96 and @xmath97 events .",
    "the bhwide program  @xcite was used for @xmath98 events .",
    "@xmath90 two - photon processes are the most important background for the case of a small mass difference @xmath99 , since such signal events have small visible energy and small transverse momentum relative to the beam direction .",
    "using the monte carlo generators phojet  @xcite , pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite , hadronic events from two - photon processes were simulated in which the invariant mass of the photon - photon system ( @xmath100 ) was larger than 5.0  gev .",
    "monte carlo samples for four - lepton events ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) were generated with the vermaseren program  @xcite .",
    "@xmath90 finally , four - fermion processes in which at least one of the fermions is a neutrino constitute a serious background .",
    "the dominant contributions come from @xmath104 or @xmath105 events .",
    "since the interference effects of various diagrams are important , the grc4f generator  @xcite was used , which takes into account all interfering diagrams and includes initial - state photon radiation .",
    "these background events were also processed through the full detector simulation and the same event analysis chain as used for the data was applied .",
    "the present analysis is based on the data collected during the 1997 run of lep2 .",
    "since the event topologies of @xmath66 and @xmath83 are similar , the same selection criteria were used for both these modes ( section  3.1 analysis a ) . in section 3.2 ( analysis b ) , the selection criteria for @xmath87 are discussed .",
    "these analyses are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the same quality criteria as in ref .",
    "@xcite were used to select tracks and clusters .",
    "variables used for the cuts , such as the total visible energy , @xmath106 , the total transverse momentum and the acoplanarity angle ( defined below ) were calculated as follows .",
    "first , the four - momenta of the tracks and those of the em and hcal clusters not associated with charged tracks were summed . whenever a calorimeter cluster had associated charged tracks , the expected energy deposited by the tracks was subtracted from the cluster energy to reduce double counting . if the energy of a cluster was smaller than the expected energy deposited by the associated tracks , the cluster energy was not used .",
    "hadron calorimeter clusters were also used in calculating event variables .",
    "a large momentum - unbalance is occasionally caused by the fluctuation in the energy measurement of clusters in the hadron calorimeter because of the limited energy resolution .",
    "therefore the transverse momentum and the visible mass calculated without the hcal clusters were also used to reduce two - photon background processes .    the following preselection criteria  ( p1  p2 ) , which are common to both analyses a and b , were applied first .",
    "the numbers of events remaining after each cut are listed in table  [ tab : neva ] . for comparison",

    "( p1 ) : :    the number of charged tracks was required to be at least four . the    ratio of the number of good tracks to the total number of    reconstructed tracks was required to be greater than 0.2 to reduce    beam - gas and beam - wall background events . the visible mass of the    event , excluding the hadron calorimeter , was also required to be    larger than 3  gev .",
    "( p2 ) : :    to reduce the background from two - photon processes and multihadronic    events , where a jet axis was close to the beam direction , the total    energy deposited had to be less than 5  gev in each sw detector , less    than 2  gev in each fd detector and less than 5  gev in each side of the    gamma - catcher .",
    "the experimental signature for @xmath69(@xmath66 ) events and @xmath70 events is an acoplanar two - jet topology with a large transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the fragmentation functions of @xmath53 and @xmath61 are very hard and the invariant mass of charm ( bottom ) quark and the spectator quark is small , therefore the jets are expected to be narrow .",
