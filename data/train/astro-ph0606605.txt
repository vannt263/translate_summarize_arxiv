    ", we demonstrated that such observations with the near - infrared [ ]  @xmath01.644  @xmath1 line is a powerful tool to study the acceleration and collimation regions @xcite . in the position - velocity diagrams ( pvds ) of l1551 irs  5 and dg  tau toward their blueshifted jets , the blueshifted [ ]  emission showed two clearly distinct components in velocity and space : the high velocity component ( hvc : @xmath8  200400  @xmath9 ) is extended and has a narrow line width , while the low velocity component ( lvc : @xmath8  50200  @xmath9 ) is observed closer to the driving sources and shows a larger line width .",
    "because of the distinct natures of these two velocity components , we suggested that they may be two physically different outflows : the hvc is a highly collimated jet , while the lvc is a widely opened disk wind .",

    "the decrease of i@xmath40 toward the stellar position at @xmath63  0@xmath41 has an important meaning .",
    "it is associated with the fact that the hvc is extended and located further away from the star than the lvc , as has been observed in the near - infrared [ ]  emission for other objects including hl  tau in the current study @xcite .",
    "decrease in forbidden line intensities toward jet driving stars was also observed in the [ ]  and [ ]  emissions and has been interpreted as a result of rapid collisional damping due to a higher density in the vicinity of the stars @xcite .",
    "the blueshifted and redshifted jets have similar peak intensities in the current [ ]  data , while the redshifted [ ]  emission was stronger than the blueshifted one in 2001 november @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to investigate the cause of this because the angular resolutions of the two observations are largely different .",
    "in addition , the slit we used had a narrower width and was misoriented with respect to the actual jet axis .",
    "redshifted emissions of optical forbidden lines ( [ ] , [ ]  and [ ] ) within 10@xmath2 from the star were also stronger than the corresponding blueshifted emissions between 1993 to 2000 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5]@xmath64 shows that the jet velocities have large asymmetry with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "the blueshifted jet has @xmath65170  200  @xmath9 , while the redshifted jet shows @xmath65100  140  @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity asymmetry in the rw  aur jet has been well known since it was discovered by @xcite with optical long - slit spectroscopy . although the asymmetry seems to exist even in the close vicinity of the star , we must be careful that the presence of a photospheric absorption line may have affected the peak velocity of the redshifted jet at @xmath63  0@xmath44 .",
    "the line is located at v@xmath66  170  kms@xmath17 with respect to the rest wavelength of the [ ]  line as indicated in figure  3 .",
    "we can thus safely say that the origin of velocity asymmetry is located within 0@xmath44 from the star .",
    "the absolute velocity decreases with distance from the star for the blueshifted jet , while it increases for the redshifted jet .",
    "this tendency was also reported by @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to produce such an asymmetry by any symmetric velocity structure between the blueshifted and redshifted jets combined with the misoriented slit effect .",
    "thus the velocity asymmetry itself may be time variable .    figure  [ fig5]@xmath67 shows the spatial variation of the velocity width . in the blueshifted jet ,",
    "the width is @xmath6100  @xmath9 near the star ( 0@xmath68 ) and decreases to 50 ",
    "60  @xmath9 for @xmath69  0@xmath45 . in the redshifted jet ,",
    "the width is @xmath650",
    "@xmath9 and shows no evidence of increase near the star .",
    "in fact , the velocity width decreases toward the star ( @xmath480@xmath44@xmath700@xmath29 ) .",
    "this may be caused by the presence of the photospheric absorption line at v@xmath66170  @xmath9 .",
    "the lvc of hl  tau seems to be strongest at the stellar position with a weaker emission significantly extended to the northeast ( @xmath71  0 , see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "because hl  tau has a scattering envelope extended to the northeast @xcite , we must first examine whether the extended lvc emission comes from scattering .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the normalized spatial profiles of intensity for the lvc , hvc , br12 and continuum emissions .",
    "the intensities for the lvc and hvc are averaged over the velocity ranges of @xmath48100 to 0  @xmath9 and @xmath48270 to @xmath48100  @xmath9 , respectively .",

    "the continuum , br12 and lvc emissions show similarly skewed spatial profiles with sharp cutoffs on the redshifted side ( @xmath53  0@xmath29 ) and gradual decreases on the blueshifted side ( @xmath71  0@xmath29 ) .",
    "the normalized spatial profile of br12 exactly matches that of the continuum on the redshifted side ( @xmath53  0@xmath29 ) , reaching its half maximum at @xmath560@xmath428 consistent with the spatial resolution .",
    "this means that the dominant source of the br12 emission coincides with that of the continuum , namely the star itself or its unresolved vicinity .",
    "we should note , however , that the peak position of the br12 spatial profile is displaced by 0@xmath4038 @xmath5 0@xmath402 with respect to that of the continuum in figure  5 .",
    "the small but finite amount of the observed spatial displacement between the br12 and continuum peaks may mean that at least part of the br12 emission at @xmath46 0@xmath29 arises in the unresolved outflow .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the recent observations suggesting that infrared lines of classical t  tauri stars or class  i objects originate in the outflow acceleration region @xcite , although existing outflow models as well as magnetospheric accretion models still have difficulties to quantitatively explain their line profile characteristics .    on the blueshifted side ( @xmath71  0@xmath29 ) , the gradual decrease of the continuum emission is caused by the scattering of the stellar light off the cavity located at the northeast of hl  tau @xcite .",
    "thus the spatial profiles of br12 and lvc similar to that of the continuum suggest that their emissions in the northeast of hl  tau arise mostly from scattering . however , the normalized spatial profile of br12 is significantly larger than that of the continuum on the blueshifted side ( @xmath71  0@xmath29 ) . the br12 emission along the blueshifted jet ,",
    "therefore , does not entirely arise from scattering of the central unresolved light source , but part of it must originate in the extended blueshifted jet itself .",
    "the normalized spatial profile of lvc is more interesting .",
    "although it basically follows a skewed shape similar to those of br12 and the continuum emission , the spatial profile of lvc in the southwest ( @xmath53  0@xmath29 ) is offset by @xmath720@xmath4077 @xmath5 0@xmath404 with respect to that of the continuum .",
    "this means that the dominant emission of lvc arises not from the unresolved vicinity of the star but in the jet @xmath6  15 au away from the star . in the northeast ( @xmath71  0@xmath29 ) , the normalized intensity of lvc is larger than that of the continuum , although the excess is not much larger than the noise level of the lvc profile .",
    "part of the extended lvc emission in the northeast thus also arises in the jet .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that the lvc of rw  aur also has its spatial maximum displaced to the blueshifted ( southeast ) side .",
    "however , this may be caused by the presence of the artificial dip around @xmath730@xmath41 and v@xmath66  90  km  s@xmath17 and is not reliable .",
    "our observations revealed that the [ ]  emission lines show both lvc and hvc in hl  tau and rw  aur .",
    "the presence and nature of the two velocity components are similar to the cases of l1551 irs  5 and dg  tau @xcite .",
    "the lvcs of hl  tau and rw  aur are , however , not as distinct as those of l1551 irs  5 and dg  tau seen in their pvds .",
    "the latter sources show that the lvc has a clearly separated peak located away from the stellar position in the pvd , while the former sources have the lvc observed only as a wing or shoulder of the hvc and its spatial location is close to , although not necessarily coincident with , the stellar position . for the jets from l1551 irs  5 and dg  tau",
    ", we suggested that the hvc is physically different from the lvc because of the largely different characteristics of the two components .",
    "in fact , it has not been easy to model the two distinct components with single outflow models @xcite . in the cases of hl",
    "tau and rw  aur , however , the lvc seems to be more physically related to the hvc from their appearance in the pvds , and we will re - examine the relation between the two velocity components for these objects below .    up to date the magnetocentrifugal force",
    "is widely considered as the most comprehensive mechanism for launching outflows from the star - disk systems of young stellar objects ( see reviews in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two kinds of popular models based on the magnetocentrifugal mechanism : the _ disk wind model _ @xcite and _ x - wind model _ @xcite .",
    "the disk wind model assumes that the outflow launching region is located over a wider range of disk radii outside the inner disk edge , while the x - wind model postulates that the launching region is located at a very narrow disk radii close to the inner disk edge where the highly concentrated stellar magnetic field interacts with the disk .",
    "synthetic pvds of the forbidden emission lines predicted by their two models may be compared with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure  [ fig7 ]",
    "we compare the pvds of hl  tau and rw  aur with those of _ the cold disk wind models _ @xcite and _ x - wind model _ @xcite .",
    "the two models show a similitude that their velocity widths are broad at the stellar position and become narrower when the position moves away from the star .",
    "the broad velocity width at the star is caused by the presence of lower velocity emission added to the radial velocity v @xmath74 100 @xmath9 , while its spatial extent ( 20  100 au ) depends on the adopted spatial resolutions of the models .",
    "this emission arises in the region where uncollimated outer stream lines have sufficient emissivity in these models .",
    "the above noted characteristic of the model pvds are also apparent in the observed pvds of hl  tau and rw  aur . by analogy to the observed pvds , we call the lower velocity emission at v @xmath74 100 @xmath9 the lvc and the spatially extended higher velocity emission at v @xmath75 100 @xmath9 the hvc",
    ". the observed pvds are , however , different from the model pvds on the following points .    1 .",
    "the hvc of the _ disk wind models _ shown in figure  [ fig7]@xmath76 and [ fig7]@xmath64 shows a velocity width of 200  500 @xmath9 , much larger than the observed width of @xmath74 60 @xmath9 . on the other hand , the width of hvc for the _ x - wind model _ shown in figure  [ fig7]@xmath67 is narrow , which may be consistent with the observed width of hvc and its symmetrical line profiles if internal velocity fluctuation in the hvc is taken into account .",
    "recently @xcite showed that a `` warm '' disk model can make narrower line widths , showing much better agreement with those of observed jets .",
    "the lvc of the _ x - wind model _ shows a significant redshifted emission arising from the streamlines on the far side .",
    "the presence of such redshifted emission coincident with the star is marginal in the observed pvds because of the contamination by the photospheric absorption at @xmath2520 @xmath9 ( see  3.1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lvc for the _ disk wind models _ has little redshifted emission at the stellar position , which is consistent with the observed characteristics of lvc unless the marginal emission is real .",
    "the hvc of the _ cold disk wind models _ exhibits significantly higher peak velocity by a factor of 22.5 than the observed hvc does , while the hvc peak velocity of the _ x - wind model _ is quantitatively consistent with the present observations .",
    "the _ disk wind models _ can be accommodated to the observations if a smaller alfvn radius by a factor of 2 - 2.5 is adopted .",
    "@xcite also indicated that a denser and slower `` warm '' disk wind are favored to solve this problem .",
    "with respect to the first point , material is launched from a large range of disk radii ( 0.07  2 au ) in the disk wind models , where lower velocity material is ejected from the outer radii in the launch zone , while higher velocity material is ejected from the inner radii ( the terminal velocity scales as the keplerian speed at the jet base ) .",
    "the broad velocity width of hvc is hence caused by the outer streamlines having significantly lower radial velocities than the inner streamlines even when they are well collimated . on the other hand ,",
    "all the streamlines of the x - wind have similar alfvn radii because they originate from the same launching point at the inner disk edge ( @xmath6 0.07 au ) , resulting in similar radial velocities when they are collimated .",
    "the narrow velocity width of the observed hvc thus means for the disk wind models that the outer streamlines with lower velocities are associated with little emission , with a rapid cutoff of emission from the inner to outer streamlines , or that all the streamlines originate from a narrow radial range , which is rather similar to the case of an x - wind .",
    "the presence of weak but spatially extended emission in the observed lvc , however , suggests that the extended lvc may correspond to the emission from the outer , low velocity streamlines that originate at larger radii than those of hvc .    regarding the second point",
    ", the x - wind model has the streamlines at the base of the jet fanning out in a wide direction , toward and away from the observers . as a result ,",
    "a very broad pedestal emission of @xmath6 300 @xmath9 wide is predicted within 20 au from the star at all inclinations , extending to @xmath25100 @xmath9 on the redshifted side .",
    "the x - wind model may be accommodated to the observed pvds if the outer streamlines with higher redshifted and blueshifted radial velocities give little emission , unless the marginal redshifted emission observed toward hl  tau is real .",
    "another possibility is that the redshifted emission is weak or hidden in the optical wavelength where the extinction across the outflow tends to be large near the disk surface .    in summary ,",
    "none of the published model pvds are fully consistent with the observed pvds of [ ]  emission from hl  tau and rw  aur",
    ".  may differ from those of [ ]  because the former line has a lower critical density than the latter one . ]",
    "the narrow velocity width and symmetrical line profiles of the hvc seem to be more consistent with the x - wind model than the disk wind model , while the observed lvc emission located away from the star is in favor of the disk wind model .",
    "given the difficulty to consistently explain the observed pvds with a single model , we may need a hybrid type model , e.g. an x - wind type outflow emanating from the truncation radius combined with a disk wind in the outer region ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite discussed recently that it may be difficult for an x - wind to co - exist with an extended disk wind .      for hl",
    "tau the peak intensity of the redshifted jet is 10 times smaller than that of the blueshifted jet when measured at the same projected distance of 1.@xmath294 or 200  au from the star . assuming the same intrinsic intensities for the blueshifted and redshifted jets",
    ", we estimate that the redshifted jet has an excess extinction of @xmath772.5  mag , corresponding to @xmath7814  mag , with respect to the blueshifted jet .",
    "this means that a significant amount of envelope material is present around hl  tau , as is consistent with its nature as being still embedded in a molecular cloud .",
    "in fact the optical [ ]  emission shows a larger gap of @xmath63@xmath36 between the redshifted outflow and the star @xcite .",
    "the optical gap size is similar to the size of the northeast scattering envelope observed by @xcite and @xcite , suggesting that the extinction is caused in the relatively spherical envelope surrounding hl  tau and its disk .",
    "the visual extinction of @xmath7914  mag at the projected radius of 200  au corresponds to the surface mass density of 0.05  g  @xmath80 or the average density of 2@xmath1610@xmath81  @xmath82 if the excess extinction occurs along the line of sight length of 400  au near the star .",
    "the surface mass density can be compared to that of the disk at the same projected radius .",
    "the disk has a surface mass density of 2  4  g  @xmath80 at a radius of 100  au @xcite , giving an expected surface mass density of 0.4  0.8  g  @xmath80 corrected for inclination at the projected radius of 200  au when we follow the two models described by @xcite .",
    "the expected surface density of the disk is still one order of magnitude larger than that derived from the excess extinction , suggesting that the disk should be truncated abruptly at some projected radius smaller than 200  au from the star , most probably near the projected radius of 0@xmath48 , which is the gap size between the redshifted outflow ( @xmath83 3@xmath84 ) and central star , corresponding to the actual radius of 160  au .      the jet from rw  aur has knots in optical forbidden line emissions @xcite , with the redshifted jet showing more knots than the blueshifted one .",
    "the current [ ]  data also shows a hint of knots along the jets . in figure",
    "[ fig5]@xmath76 , the redshifted jet intensity shows four local maxima at @xmath85 @xmath480@xmath425 , @xmath480@xmath473 , @xmath481@xmath420 , and @xmath482@xmath429 , and the blueshifted jet intensity has two local maxima and one shoulder at @xmath85 0@xmath417 , 0@xmath448 , and 1@xmath425 , respectively .",
    "we compared these positions with the results by @xcite , who presented the proper motions of knots within @xmath612@xmath2 from the star observed in [ ]  and [ ]  lines from 1997 to 2000 .",
    "the results of the comparison are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the local maxima at @xmath85 @xmath480@xmath425 and 0@xmath417 may be stationary because knots were observed at similar positions in 1998 and 2000 in the optical forbidden lines .",
    "the local maxima at @xmath85 @xmath481@xmath420 and @xmath482@xmath429 correspond to the knots r6 and r5 , respectively , of @xcite when their proper motions of 0@xmath416  yr@xmath17 and 0@xmath424  yr@xmath17 , respectively , are taken into account .",
    "the shoulder around @xmath85 1@xmath425 @xmath5 0@xmath415 may correspond to the knot b4 if it has a proper motion of 0@xmath434@xmath50@xmath41  yr@xmath17 .",
    "4 .    the local maxima at @xmath85 @xmath480@xmath473 and 0@xmath448 may be newly ejected knots because they are close to the source and were not seen in @xcite .",
    "in general , the local maxima observed in the [ ]  intensity spatial profile show good agreement with the optical forbidden line knot positions if their proper motions are taken into consideration .",
    "because [ ]  has a larger critical density than [ ] @xcite , [ ]  traces denser regions of knots detected in [ ] .",
    "we observed the jets from hl  tau and rw  aur  a in the [ ]  @xmath0  1.644  @xmath33 m emission line with high angular and spectral resolutions using the subaru telescope adaptive optics system .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the blueshifted jet for each object shows two emission features : a strong and spatially extended emission with a peak velocity of @xmath48200 to @xmath48170  @xmath9 and a less blueshifted wing or shoulder emission covering @xmath48100 to 0  @xmath9 localized to the stellar position . by analogy with the [ ]  jets from l1551 irs  5 and",
    "dg  tau , we call them the high ( hvc ) and low ( lvc ) velocity components , respectively",
    "the position velocity diagrams ( pvds ) for the blueshifted jets from hl  tau and rw  aur are similar to those of l1551 irs  5 and dg  tau except that the lvcs for the former objects are not clearly detached from the stellar positions . because of this , they are similar to the synthesized pvds of single jet model calculations .",
    "3 .    for hl",
    "tau , however , detailed comparison between the spatial profiles of the lvc and continuum revealed that peak of the lvc is displaced by @xmath60@xmath4077 @xmath5 0@xmath404 from the star and is extended @xmath61@xmath36 along the jet , suggesting that peak of the lvc emission does not coincide with the stellar position but is located @xmath615  au away from the star and is extended over @xmath6200 au .",
    "the observed pvds are compared with the synthesized pvds of cold disk wind and x - wind models .",
    "the disk wind model tends to have too large line width at the jet , while the x - wind model has excess redshifted emission at the stellar position .",
    "the narrow velocity width of the observed high velocity emission supports an x - wind type model where the launching region is localized in a small radial range , while the low velocity emission located away from the star favors the presence of a cold disk wind .",
    "5 .    for hl",
    "tau , the normalized spatial profile of br12 is significantly extended compared with the normalized continuum profile along the blueshifted jet .",
    "it indicates that the br12 emission originates not only from the central unresolved region but also in the blueshifted jet itself .",
    "the redshifted counter jets were detected from both hl  tau and rw  aur .",
    "the pvd of hl  tau shows a gap of 0@xmath48 between the redshifted jet and the star , which is caused by the presence of an optically thick circumstellar disk of @xmath6160 au in radius . the redshifted jet from rw  aur  a shows a sharp drop toward the star from its peak located at y@xmath860@xmath42 , suggesting that its disk radius is smaller than 40  au .",
    "the local intensity maxima in the rw  aur jet show good agreement with the knot positions identified in optical forbidden line emissions when their proper motions are taken into account .",
