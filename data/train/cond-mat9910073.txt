    "the electronic structure at the edge of quantum - hall ( qh ) systems depends sensitively on the interplay between the external potential confining the electrons to the finite sample , electrostatic repulsion , as well as exchange and correlation effects . for an ultimately sharp edge  @xcite",
    ", a single branch of chiral one - dimensional ( 1d ) excitations is predicted to exist when the filling factor @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an odd integer  @xcite . in that case , the dynamics of edge excitations can be described  @xcite using a tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model  @xcite with only the right - moving  @xcite degrees of freedom present . however , for a confining potential that is just not sharp enough to stabilize a single - branch edge , a different configuration is realized where a lump of electron charge is separated from the bulk of the qh sample  @xcite .",
    "such a _ reconstructed _ edge supports three branches of chiral 1d edge excitations , two right - moving and one left - moving . for even weaker confining potential ,",
    "further reconstructions occur , leading to a proliferation of edge - excitation modes  @xcite . the microscopic structure of a very smooth edge is dominantly determined by electrostatics , which favors a phase separation of the 2d electron system at the edge into a series of alternating compressible and incompressible strips  @xcite .",
    "effective tl theories  @xcite describing single - branch and multi - branch qh edges predict luttinger - liquid behavior , i.e. , power laws governing the energy dependence of electronic correlation functions .",
    "the characteristic exponents of these power laws depend , in general , on details of the microscopic edge structure .",
    "however , in the absence of coupling between different chiral edge branches or , in some cases , due to disorder effects  @xcite , power - law exponents turn out to be universally dependent on the bulk filling factor . at present ,",
    "microscopic details of the edge structure that is realized in experiment  @xcite are not fully known . to facilitate a realistic comparison between theory and experiment , it is necessary to study the low - lying edge excitations of reconstructed and smooth edges and investigate interaction effects on the luttinger - liquid power - law exponents when more than one branch of edge excitations is present .",
    "we focus on the edge of a spin - polarized  @xcite qh sample at @xmath2 that has undergone reconstruction such that three branches of edge excitations are present . to be specific , we choose the landau gauge where lowest - landau - level ( lll ) basis states @xmath3 are labeled by a 1d wave vector @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the magnetic length , @xmath6 is the edge perimeter , and @xmath7 . in the absence of interactions between different edge branches ,",
    "the ground state would be a generalized fermi - sea state that is a slater determinant of lll basis states whose wave - vector label satisfies @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the fermi ` surface ' consists of three ( fermi ) points @xmath10 . as in tomonaga s",
    "approach to interacting 1d electron systems  @xcite , long - wave - length electronic excitations at the reconstructed edge can be identified according to which fermi point they belong to .",
    "this makes it possible to rewrite the long - wave - length part of the electron operator as follows : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 denotes the coordinate vector in the 2d plane , and the operator @xmath13 creates an electron belonging to the chiral 1d edge branch labeled r , w , b , respectively .",
    "the interaction part of the 2d hamiltonian for electrons in the lll is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electron density .",
    "we consider the case when electrons interact via unscreened coulomb interaction , @xmath16 we obtain the low - energy part of @xmath17 by inserting eq .",
    "( [ electron ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ intham ] ) ; it is effectively 1d and comprises various scattering processes of electrons that are close to one of the three fermi points .",
    "terms corresponding to forward scattering and backscattering  @xcite have been discussed before  @xcite . together with the one - body part of the original 2d hamiltonian , they can be rewritten in terms of a tl model hamiltonian , @xmath18 , which is quadratic in the fourier components @xmath19 of the chiral 1d densities @xmath20^\\dagger\\psi^{(\\alpha)}(x)$ ] ( here , @xmath21 ) . in the long - wave - length limit , where coulomb matrix elements dominate the bare fermi velocities ,",

    "in addition to forward and backscattering , the following term occurs in the effective 1d hamiltonian describing the low - energy excitations of a reconstructed qh edge : @xmath25^\\dagger\\big [ \\psi^{{{\\mathrm{(b)}}}}(x^\\prime)\\big]^\\dagger\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\psi^{{{\\mathrm{(w)}}}}(x^\\prime)\\,\\psi^{{{\\mathrm{(w)}}}}(x ) e^{i d \\frac{x - x^\\prime}{2 } - i\\delta \\frac{x+x^\\prime}{2 } } + { \\mathrm{h.c . } } \\bigg\\}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we introduced the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the distance @xmath28 corresponds to the width of the edge .",
    "note that @xmath29 represents interaction processes ( and their time - reversed version ) where two electrons from the left - moving w - branch are scattering off each other such that one of them ends up in the right - moving r - branch and the other one in the right - moving b - branch .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ umfig ] . ) interaction processes converting two left - movers into two right - movers ( and _ vice versa _ ) are familiar from lattice models for conventional interacting 1d electron systems ; there they are called _ umklapp _ processes  @xcite . based on that analogy , we adopt the term _ umklapp scattering _ for the interaction processes given by @xmath29 .",
    "note that momentum conservation implies a commensuration issue for umklapp scattering . in the 1d hubbard model , low - energy properties",
    "are only affected by umklapp processes if the large momentum transfer accrued ( @xmath30 ) is close to a reciprocal - lattice vector  @xcite which is the case , e.g. , at half - filling .",
    "similarly , umklapp scattering at a reconstructed edge is most relevant in the symmetric case when @xmath31 .",
    "note also that the matrix element @xmath32 gets small rapidly with increasing @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; it is given by @xmath35\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\int d\\kappa \\,\\ , \\frac{\\exp\\left\\ { -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\kappa - \\ell d/2\\right]^2\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{(x - x^\\prime)^2/\\ell^2 + \\kappa^2 } } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the new umklapp process does not conserve particle number in each edge branch separately .",

    "the umklapp part of the hamiltonian , @xmath29 , introduces a self - interaction of the left - moving neutral normal mode of @xmath46 . the edge - magnetoplasmon mode and the right - moving neutral mode",
    "are unaffected by umklapp scattering and remain free .",
    "we have been able to solve the theory including umklapp _ exactly _ for arbitrary @xmath34 and @xmath42 using a refermionization technique  @xcite whereby the hamiltonian for the chiral 1d bosonic field @xmath44 with interaction @xmath29 is mapped onto that of a chiral 1d pseudo - spin-1/2 fermion in an external magnetic field that is perpendicular to the pseudo - spin quantization axis .",
    "in addition to the characteristic energy scale for umklapp scattering , given by @xmath47 , the parameter @xmath48 emerges from the calculation that measures the ineffectiveness of umklapp scattering due to deviation from perfect commensuration .",
    "we obtain the spectral functions for tunneling into the chiral r , w , b edge branches .",

    "as the central result of our study , we find that umklapp scattering _ diminishes _ the value of the power - law exponent in the tunneling density of states below the characteristic energy scale @xmath53 .",
