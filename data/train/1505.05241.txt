    "<S> computing approximations to the real solutions of a fewnomial system @xmath0 requires that @xmath0 be converted into its dual gale system @xmath1 which is solved using khovanskii - rolle continuation , then the numerical approximations to solutions of @xmath1 are converted back to numerical approximations to solutions of the original fewnomial system @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> symbolic choices made in constructing the dual system affect the performance of the khovanskii - rolle continuation algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> one such choice is that of a basis for the nullspace of the matrix of exponent vectors of the monomials of @xmath0 . when the nullspace meets the positive orthant , a bound lower than the fewnomial bound holds . </S>",
    "<S> choosing a positive basis element results in far fewer paths to be followed in the khovanskii - rolle continuation algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when the exponent vectors of the original polynomial system are not in convex position and a sign condition holds on the coefficient matrix . </S>",
    "<S> such sign conditions are also found in recent work giving very strong bounds on positive solutions  @xcite and are considered to be multivariate versions of descartes rule of signs .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this new descartes-like bound , we make explicit the algorithms for both the creation of @xmath1 from @xmath0 and the computation of solutions of @xmath0 from solutions of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these steps were described existentially in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented these algorithms in a software package galeduality , which is available at each authors website . </S>",
    "<S> this will be the front end for a software package that we are developing for khovanskii - rolle continuation .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ s : khro ] gives a description of gale duality and sketches khovanskii - rolle continuation , illustrating it through an extended example . in section  [ s : bound ] , we present our descartes-like bound for fewnomial systems and establish a key lemma about the location of points to be tracked in the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> explicit pseudocode for using gale duality to compute master functions ( algorithm  [ alg : wrapping ] ) and to transform approximations to solutions of the gale system into approximations to solutions of the fewnomial system ( algorithm  [ alg : unwrapping ] ) is provided in section  [ s : algos ] , along with details for portions of these algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> one subroutine of algorithm  [ alg : wrapping ] requiring more care is covered in subsection  [ s : null ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a brief description of our software package is provided in section  [ s : software ] . </S>"
