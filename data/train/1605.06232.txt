    "herglotz - nevanlinna functions in one variable are functions analytic in the upper half plane having non - negative imaginary part .",
    "this class has been very well studied during the last century and has proven very useful in many applications .",
    "it seems natural to consider corresponding functions in several variables , i.e. analytic functions that have non - negative imaginary part if all variables lie in the upper half plane . from applications point of view",
    "such functions are very interesting when considering linear passive systems with several parameters .    in the treatment of herglotz - nevanlinna functions in one variable ,",
    "a very strong tool is the classical result that these functions can be characterized via integral representations , cf .",
    "theorem [ thm21 ] .",
    "it is hence a natural question to ask for a corresponding representation for functions in several variables .",
    "already almost 50 yeast ago the form of such integral representations was suggested by vladimirov , see e.g. @xcite . using a very heavy machinery of classical distribution theory ,",
    "it is shown that every herglotz - nevanlinna function can be written in such a form , but it is a priory assumed that the measure appearing in the formula is the boundary measure of the function .",
    "thus the drawback in these results is that they do not specify the properties of the measure and hence can not provide a characterization as in the case of only one variable . in @xcite",
    "the authors use a different approach in order to find a characterization , however , the obtained representation becomes much more involved . in view of the present result",
    "one can in fact say that both the representation and the conditions on the measure are _ too _ complicated since it turns out that many terms there actually vanish or simplify radically , see remark [ vlad ] for more details .",
    "recently the question of a characterization was taken up again by agler , mccarthy and young in @xcite , see also agler , tully - doyle and young in @xcite .",
    "they found a characterization via operator representations , however , only for certain subclasses of functions satisfying an asymptotic condition .    in the present paper",
    ", we solve the characterization problem for the whole class of herglotz - nevanlinna functions in two variables by deriving an integral representation together with conditions on the representing measure .",
    "even if these representations are of the same form as in @xcite , our result contains considerably more information , since we obtain a full ( but simple ) description of all representing measures .",
    "moreover , the proof is shorter and more elementary in the sense that is uses only theorems [ thm21 ] and [ 04thm2 ] which are in their essence built upon cauchy s integral formula and helly s selection principle .",
    "we use - as in the classical proof for the one dimensional case - a corresponding result for the polydisk , and then a transformation of variables .",
    "however , unlike in one variable the terms arising from the boundary of the area of integration are quite delicate and need very careful treatment in order to simplify the representation to the desired form .",
    "it appears that the requirements on the representing measures have quite strong consequences , which are discussed in section [ measure4 ] .",
    "as usual @xmath0 denotes the unit disk in the complex plane while @xmath1 denotes the upper and @xmath2 denotes the right half - plane . throughout this paper we will use the convention that @xmath3 denotes the complex variable that lies in the upper half - plane while @xmath4 denote the variable that lies in the disk .",
    "we recall also the fact that the unit disk and the upper half - plane are biholomorphic .",
    "one map achieving this is @xmath5 defined as @xmath6 .",
    "its inverse is then given as @xmath7 .",
    "note also that @xmath8 is a bijection between the sets @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    ", every such function @xmath11 then uniquely determines a function @xmath12 with respect to the biholomorphisms @xmath8 and @xmath13 , as elaborated by the diagram in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the converse also holds ; a function @xmath14 uniquely determines @xmath15 with respect to the same biholomorphisms .",
    "it can be shown that the only herglotz - nevanlinna functions that are excluded form this correspondence are in fact real - constant functions .",
