    "let @xmath1 be a polynomial ring over a field @xmath2 and let @xmath3 be a homogeneous ideal .",
    "two measures of the complexity of @xmath0 are its projective dimension , and its ( castelnuovo - mumford ) regularity ; see  @xcite .    there have been attempts to obtain uniform bounds for projective dimension and regularity based on numerical invariants of the ideal .",
    "bounds on regularity are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "m. stillman asked if there is a bound for the projective dimension of an ideal having minimal generators in degrees @xmath4 , when the number of variables in the ring is not fixed . only partial answers to this question",
    "are known ; see  @xcite .",
    "related to stillman s question , c. huneke asked the following : is the size of a monomial support of an ideal a bound for its projective dimension ? here , by _ a monomial support _ of @xmath0 , we mean the collection of monomials that appear as terms in a set of minimal generators of @xmath0 . note that an ideal can have different monomial supports . if @xmath0 is a monomial ideal , generated by @xmath5 monomials , then @xmath6 ; this follows from the taylor resolution of @xmath7 which has length at most @xmath5  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ex . 17.11 ) .",
    "we answer huneke s question in the negative ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : main ] , we construct a binomial ideal to show that the projective dimension can grow exponentially with the size of a monomial support .",
    "motivated by this example , we wonder :    [ qn : pdub ] suppose @xmath8 has a monomial support of @xmath5 monomials , counted with multiplicity",
    ". then what is a good upper bound for @xmath9 ?",
    "let @xmath10 be arbitrary .",
    "the ideal we construct in the next section has a support of @xmath11 monomials counted with multiplicity and projective dimension @xmath12 . using this example",
    ", we show that for any positive integer @xmath5 , the maximum of the projective dimension of an ideal @xmath0 with a support of @xmath5 monomials , counted with multiplicity , is at least @xmath13 .",
    "therefore any answer to question  [ qn : pdub ] should be at least exponential . if the number of variables of @xmath1 is not fixed , as in stillman s question , the existence of any bound is still unknown .",
    "our decision of taking the multiplicity into account while counting the monomials in the support of @xmath0 is only a matter of exposition .",
    "for example , let @xmath14 be @xmath5 distinct monomials , all of the same degree , and let @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 s in @xmath18 be a minimal system of generators for an ideal @xmath0 . by doing an elimination , analogous to the one used in computing a reduced grbner basis , we can find a system of generators @xmath19 , @xmath20 , such that the initial monomial of @xmath21 does not belong to the monomial support of @xmath22 when @xmath23 . in this way we get a monomial support for @xmath0 of at most @xmath24 monomials , counted with multiplicity .",
    "the maximum value of it , as a function of @xmath25 , is @xmath26 , which occurs when @xmath27 .",
    "in general , if we have @xmath5 distinct monomials in a monomial support of an homogeneous ideal @xmath0 , then we would have at most @xmath26 of them when counted with multiplicity , this is because the above function is quadratic and the worst possible case happens precisely when @xmath0 is generated by forms having the same degree .",
    "the following example is a slight generalization of the ideal mentioned in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath28 and let @xmath29 be positive integers",
    ". denote by @xmath30 the index set @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a @xmath33-dimensional array of variables and let @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath35 we will call @xmath36 _ the @xmath37th slice in the @xmath38th direction_. fig .",

    "write @xmath43 for the homogeneous maximal ideal of @xmath1 and let @xmath44 @xmath45 is the product of the variables not appearing in the first slices in each of the directions @xmath46 .",
    "we claim that @xmath47 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 is an associated prime of @xmath7 , so @xmath42 .",
    "we first reduce the proof to the case when @xmath50 , as follows .",
    "since @xmath0 is generated by monomials and binomials with @xmath51 as coefficients , a grbner basis for @xmath0 , and hence the ideal membership problem @xmath52 are independent of the characteristic of the field .",
    "see  @xcite for the definition of a grbner basis and the ideal membership problem .",
    "we assume , from now on , that @xmath50 .    let @xmath53 . using the binomial relations in @xmath0 , we can write @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes omitting the variable from the product .",
    "consider the slice @xmath56 . if @xmath57 is such that @xmath58 , then there exists @xmath59 such that @xmath60 .",
    "hence @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the tableau @xmath63 of non - negative integers .",
    "we use _ tableau _ loosely here ; we only mean that the rows of @xmath62 possibly have different number of elements .",
    "for such a tableau @xmath62 , we say it _ satisfies row condition @xmath64 _ if the sum of the elements on the @xmath38th row is @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "for each @xmath67 , we define a monomial @xmath68 see fig .",
    "[ fig:3piped ] for an illustration of @xmath69 in the @xmath70 case .",

    "we show below that , under this action , @xmath74 while @xmath75 from which we conclude that @xmath76 , thus proving the proposition .    for any tableau @xmath62 that satisfies the row condition @xmath77 , write @xmath78 for the corresponding monomial term that appears in @xmath79 ( see ) .",
    "let @xmath80 then @xmath81 for some non - zero rational number @xmath82 if @xmath83 , then @xmath45 contains a variable that @xmath78 does not contain , so @xmath84 .",
