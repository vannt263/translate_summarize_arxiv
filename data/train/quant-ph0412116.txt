    "the following problem appears in the field of quantum communication and in quantum statistics : a collection of statistical operators with some a priori probabilities ( initial ensemble ) describes the possible initial states of a quantum system and an observer wants to decide in which of these states the system is by means of a quantum measurement on the system itself .",
    "the quantity of information given by the measurement is the classical mutual information @xmath0 of the input / output joint distribution ( shannon information ) .",
    "interesting upper and lower bounds for @xmath0 , due to the quantum nature of the measurement , are given in the literature @xcite , where the measurement is described by a _",

    "the introduction of the general notion of instrument , the association to it of a channel and the use of uhlmann s monotonicity theorem allows us to obtain the same result in a more direct way and to extend it to a more general set up . in section [ hall ] a new upper bound ( [ newbound ] ) for the classical mutual information @xmath0 is obtained by combining an idea by hall @xcite and inequality ( [ sww ] ) .",

    "in @xcite hall exhibits a transformation on the initial ensemble and on the pov measure which leaves invariant @xmath0 but not the initial @xmath191-quantity and in this way produces a new upper bound on the classical information . inspired by hall s transformation , a new instrument can be constructed in such a way that the analogous of inequality ( [ sww ] ) produces an upper bound on @xmath0 stronger than both hall s and holevo s ones .",
