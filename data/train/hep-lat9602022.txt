    "whether or not glueballs have been observed in experiment is still generally considered unsettled . since the properties of glueballs are not expected to be drastically different from the properties of flavor singlet bosons including valence quarks and antiquarks , the identification in experiment of states with large glueball contributions is difficult without a reliable calculation of the predictions of qcd .",
    "the lattice formulation of qcd appears to us to give the most reliable method now available for determining qcd s predictions for the masses and decay couplings of glueballs .    for the infinite volume continuum limit of the valence ( quenched ) approximation to the lightest scalar glueball mass",
    ", we reported some time ago @xcite the value 1740(71 ) mev .",
    "this prediction was obtained using ensembles of 25000 to 30000 gauge configurations on each of several different lattices",
    ". an earlier independent valence approximation calculation @xcite of the scalar glueball mass , extrapolated to the continuum limit @xcite following ref .",
    "@xcite , yields a prediction of 1625(94 ) mev .",
    "the calculation of ref  @xcite uses ensembles of between 1000 and 3000 configurations on several different lattices . combining the two mass calculations and taking into account the correlation between their statistical uncertainties arising from a common procedure for converting lattice quantities into physical units gives a scalar glueball mass of 1707(64 ) mev .",
    "this result and the mass prediction with larger statistical weight are both in good agreement with the mass of @xmath2 and are strongly inconsistent with all but @xmath3  @xcite among the other established flavor singlet resonances which could be scalars .",
    "for @xmath3 the disagreement is still by more than three standard deviations .",
    "the valence approximation , in effect , replaces the momentum and frequency dependent color dielectric constant arising from quark - antiquark vacuum polarization with its zero - momentum , zero - frequency limit @xcite . for the long distance properties of hadrons",
    ", we would expect this approximation to be fairly reliable .",
    "the infinite volume continuum limits , for example , of the valence approximation to the masses of eight low lying hadrons composed of quarks and antiquarks differ from experiment by amounts ranging up to 6% @xcite .",
    "a 6% error in the glueball mass would be 100 mev .",
    "an adaptation of an argument giving a negative sign for the valence approximation error in @xmath4  @xcite also suggests a negative sign for the glueball mass error .",
    "thus we would expect the scalar glueball in full qcd to lie between 1707(64 ) mev and 1807(64 ) mev , again favoring @xmath2 with @xmath3 still possible but improbable .    the key question not answered by the mass results , however , is whether the lightest scalar glueball has a decay width small enough for this particle actually to be identified in experiment .",
    "it seems likely to us that a scalar glueball with a width of a few hundred mev or less and mass in the neighborhood of 1700 mev would already have been seen in experiment .",
    "alternatively , if the scalar glueball has a width of a gev or more , the prospect of ever finding this particle seems remote .",
    "a further question in the identification of @xmath2 as a glueball is raised by the argument that since glueballs are flavor singlets they should have the same couplings to @xmath5 , to @xmath6 , and to @xmath7 .",
    "this equality is violated by @xmath2 decay couplings .    in the present article",
    "we report the first lattice qcd calculation of the valence ( quenched ) approximation to the decay couplings of the lightest scalar glueball to pairs of pseudoscalar quark - antiquark states .",
    "the couplings constants we obtain , combined with the mass prediction of 1740(71 ) mev , give a total two - pseudoscalar decay width of 108(29 ) mev . with any reasonable guess concerning the scalar glueball s branching fraction to multibody decay modes , the resulting total decay width is well below 200 mev and therefore small enough for the scalar glueball to be identified in experiment .",
    "in fact , the predicted total two - pseudoscalar decay width , and individual couplings to @xmath5 , to @xmath6 , and to @xmath8 are all in good agreement with properties of @xmath2 and inconsistent with all other established flavor singlet resonances which could be scalars .",
    "the total two - body width of @xmath2 is 99(15 ) mev @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our predicted coupling constants with data for @xmath2 @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : lambdas ] .",
    "the calculation we present uses 10500 independent gauge configurations on a lattice @xmath9 at @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding inverse lattice spacing is 1.35 gev .",
    "we believe this lattice has spacing sufficiently small and volume sufficiently large to give partial widths within 30% of their infinite volume continuum limits .",
    "-5 mm -13 mm    -9 mm    in the valence approximation , according to one point of view , glueballs are pure field and are not mixed with states including valence quarks or antiquarks .",
    "the agreement between the glueball mass and decay couplings found in the valence approximation and the observed mass and decay couplings of @xmath2 appears to us to be strong evidence that this state is largely a scalar glueball with at most some relatively smaller amplitude for configurations including valence quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the calculations presented here were carried out on the gf11 parallel computer @xcite at ibm research and took approximately two years to complete at a sustained computation rate of between 6 and 7 gflops .",
