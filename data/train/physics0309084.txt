    "stationary , temporally and spatially localized , x - shaped optical wave packets , having a duration of a few tens of femtoseconds and spot size of a few microns , have been recently observed to be spontaneously generated in dispersive nonlinear materials from a standard laser wave packet @xcite .",
    "balancing between second - order or kerr nonlinearity , group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) , angular dispersion and diffraction , has been suggested to act as a kind of mode - locking mechanism that drives pulse reshaping and keeps the interacting waves trapped , phase and group - matched @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate on the nature of these waves .",
    "the main hypothesis underlying our investigation is that these nonlinearly generated x - shaped waves behave asymptotically as linear waves .",
    "this assumption is based , first , on the observed stationarity , not only of the central hump of the wave packet , but also of its asymptotic , low - intensity , conical part @xcite , stationarity that can not be attributed to nonlinear wave interactions , but to some linear mechanism of compensation between material and angular dispersion .",
    "indeed , several kinds of linear polychromatic versions of bessel beams @xcite , as bessel - x pulses @xcite , pulsed bessel beams @xcite , subcycle bessel - x pulses or focus wave modes @xcite , and envelope x waves @xcite , with the capability of maintaining transversal and temporal ( longitudinal ) localization in dispersive linear media , have been described in recent years ( for an unified description and the extension to media with anomalous dispersion , see also ref . ) .",
    "in contrast to free - space x - waves @xcite and bessel - x pulses @xcite , stationarity in dispersive media requires the introduction of an appropriate amount of cone angle dispersion that leads to the cancellation of material gvd with cone angle dispersion - induced gvd @xcite .",
    "second , polychromatic bessel beams , with or without angular dispersion @xcite , have the ability of propagating at rather arbitrary effective phase and group velocities in dispersive media , as has to be done by the phase matched and mutually trapped fundamental @xcite and second harmonic @xcite nonlinearly generated x waves .    for these reasons ,",
    "in this paper we present a new and more comprehensive description of localized and stationary optical waves in linear dispersive media , henceforth called _ wave modes _ , that is particularly suitable for understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal features of the nonlinear x waves generated in experiments . on the linear hand , this description allows us to predict the existence of new kinds of wave modes , and classify all them according to the values of a few physically meaningful parameters .    each wave mode",
    "is specified by the values of the defeated material gvd , the mode group velocity mismatch ( gvm ) and phase mismatch ( pm ) with respect to a plane pulse of the same carrier frequency in the same medium .",
    "wave modes are then shown ( section [ wm ] ) to belong to two broad categories : hyperbolic modes , with x - shaped spatiotemporal structure , if material dispersion is normal , or elliptic modes , with o - shaped structure , if material dispersion is anomalous @xcite . in section [ class ]",
    "we show that each wave mode can adopt the approximate form of 1 ) a pulsed bessel beam ( pbb ) , 2 ) an _ envelope focus wave mode _ ( efwm ) , or 3 ) an envelope x ( ex ) wave in normally dispersive media [ _ envelope o _ ( eo ) _ wave _ in anomalously dispersive media ] , according that the mode bandwidth makes pm , gvm or defeated gvd , respectively , to be dominant mode characteristic on propagation .",
    "this classification allows us to understand the spatiotemporal features of wave modes in dispersive media in terms of a few parameters ( the characteristic pm , gvm and gvd lengths ) , including modes with mixed pulsed bessel , focus wave mode , and x - like ( o - like ) structure .",
    "the above description is obtained from the paraxial approximation to wave propagation .",
    "we choose this approach because of its wider use in nonlinear optics , and because it leads to simpler expressions in terms of parameters directly linked to the physically relevant properties of the mode and dispersive medium . in section [ np ]",
    "we compare the paraxial and the more exact nonparaxial approaches , to show that the paraxial approach is accurate enough for the description of wave modes currently generated by linear optical devices @xcite and in nonlinear wave mixing processes @xcite .",
    "we start by considering the propagation of a three - dimensional wave packet @xmath0 [ @xmath1 of a certain optical carrier frequency @xmath2 , subject to the effects of diffraction and dispersion of the material medium . within the paraxial approximation , and up to second order in dispersion ,",
    "the propagation of narrow - band pulses is ruled by the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the propagation direction , @xmath5 is the local time , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the propagation constant in the medium .",
    "( [ pwe ] ) is valid for a narrow envelope spectrum @xmath9 around @xmath10 , that is , for bandwidths @xmath11 a condition that requires at least few carrier oscillations to fall within the envelope @xmath12 .",
    "we search for stationary and localized solutions of eq .",
    "( [ pwe ] ) in the wide sense that the _ intensity _ does not depend on @xmath4 in a reference frame moving at _ some velocity_. these solutions",
    "must then be of the form @xmath13 the free parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed to be small in the sense that @xmath16 and phase velocity @xmath17 of the wave differ slightly from those of a plane pulse of the same carrier frequency in the same material , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .    under the assumption of asymptotic linear behavior of nonlinear x - waves , we can get some insight on the possible values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 of nonlinear x - waves on the only basis of the linear dispersive properties of the medium .",
    "if , for instance , a pulse of frequency @xmath20 generates a stationary and localized second harmonic pulse ( @xmath21 ) travelling at the same group and phase velocities as the fundamental pulse @xcite , we must have @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that is , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
