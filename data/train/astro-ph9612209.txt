    "over the past three decades , much work has been devoted to refining the input data used in calculating solar - neutrino fluxes .",
    "the comparison between the predicted and the observed fluxes has important implications for particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "most recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to a relatively minor effect , the electron screening of nuclear fusion reactions @xcite , and it has even been argued @xcite that the discrepancy between observations and theoretical predictions might be reduced significantly if a different screening correction is adopted .",
    "we test in this paper the robustness of the standard wkb analytic treatment due to salpeter @xcite by solving numerically the relevant schrodinger equation , including a debye - huckel screening potential , for the fundamental proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) reaction . the unscreened rate of this reaction can be calculated precisely @xcite using standard weak - interaction theory , accurate laboratory data for the two - proton system , and different refined deuteron wave functions in agreement with a variety of nuclear - physics measurements .",
    "radiative corrections are also included in the standard calculation @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we re - derive salpeter s analytic result for the weak - screening limit using a kinetic - theory approach ( rather than salpeter s thermodynamic arguments ) . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the proton - proton wave function in both a screened and unscreened coulomb potential by numerical solution of the schrodinger equation .",
    "we then use these results to evaluate numerically the electron - screening correction to the proton - proton reaction , thereby testing the validity of the standard wkb calculation . in an appendix",

    "to begin , we re - derive salpeter s screening correction . to do so",
    ", we use kinetic theory to calculate reaction rates in both a screened and unscreened plasma .",
    "although salpeter s derivation was based on a thermodynamic argument , this alternative approach recovers the same results , and it will be useful for understanding the numerical work in the following section . with our analytic approach , a very small correction to salpeter s results is obtained and presented in the appendix .",
    "the nuclear fusion rates in the solar interior are controlled primarily by coulomb barriers .",
    "therefore , the energy dependence of the fusion cross section is usually written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a function that varies smoothly in the absence of resonances , and @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the charges of the two colliding nuclei , and @xmath7 is their relative velocity .    the controlling factor , @xmath8 , in eq .",

    "the coulomb interaction energy between a nucleus and its nearest few electrons and nuclei of the gas is small compared with the thermal energy @xmath21 . in this case , the surrounding electrons and ions are only slightly displaced , and we obtain a screened potential of the form @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the debye radius for the cloud ; @xmath24 is the reduced mass in atomic mass units ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the mass fraction , charge , and mass number , respectively , of nucleus @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is a measure of interparticle distance ; @xmath31 is the density in units of g  @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 is avogadro s constant .    for the screened potential , the penetration factor is then given by @xmath34^{1/2}du \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 . here , @xmath36 is the classical turning - point radius defined by @xmath37 . however ,",

    "although @xmath41 depends on the energy , the effect of the correction on the thermally - averaged cross section can be approximated by evaluating @xmath41 at the most probable energy of interaction , @xmath42^{1/3}\\\\            & = & 1.2204(z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}at_{6}^{2})^{1/3}\\ ; \\ ; { \\rm kev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the atomic mass unit , and @xmath44 is the temperature in units of @xmath45 k. then , @xmath46 where the salpeter factor @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath31 is the density in units of g  @xmath32 , and @xmath49 for the @xmath1 reaction , @xmath50 , which justifies the small-@xmath38 approximation used above . equations ( [ velocity])([xsubzero ] ) provide an alternative derivation of the salpeter @xcite weak - screening formula .",
    "we now calculate numerically the cross section for the @xmath1 reaction for a coulomb potential and a screened coulomb potential to compare with the wkb calculation of the screening correction .",
    "to do so , we note that the reaction rate is proportional to @xmath51 @xcite , where @xmath52 is the overlap integral of the proton - proton wave function and the deuteron wave function , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is @xmath1 scattering length , @xmath55 is the deuteron binding wave number , and @xmath56 is the deuteron binding energy . the function @xmath57 is the radial part of the @xmath58-state deuteron wave function .",

    "@xcite .    for the purposes of this exercise",
    ", we use the mcgee wave function @xcite for the deuteron . if another wave function ( which fits the deuteron data ) is used , the overlap integral changes only slightly .",

    "for @xmath63 we use an exponential potential which yields the observed value for the scattering length and effective range @xcite .",
    "again , the overlap integral turns out to be practically independent of the detailed shape of the nuclear potential ( as long as it matches the measured scattering length and effective range ) , so the choice of nuclear potential is unimportant for determining the screening correction .    in the weak - screening case ,",

    "at which the @xmath1 reaction occurs ( @xmath78 ) , the fractional difference is @xmath0 . in fact , at smaller @xmath77 , the fractional difference is expected to be even smaller , as argued below .",
