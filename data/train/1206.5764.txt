    "the extensive experimental study of the @xmath10 reactions ( @xmath11 ) @xcite attracted much attention from theorists ( for recent references see @xcite ) .",
    "the reason was the report of the babar collaboration @xcite about a persistent rise of the combination @xmath12 in the @xmath3 region from @xmath13 gev@xmath14 to @xmath15 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the measured form factor surpassed the asymptotic behaviour @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 gev , predicted by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "several theoretical investigations @xcite indicated , however , that the corresponding increase of the @xmath4 form factor for large @xmath3 values is hard to explain . very recently new experimental information came from the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "the data for @xmath12 presented by this group show only a very mild ( if any ) increase in the high-@xmath3 region .",
    "in this situation a comparison of the @xmath4 form factor with the ones for @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be helpful . at first sight",
    ", this appears difficult because of the different structure ( different quark distribution amplitudes ) of these particles . in the present note",
    "we show however , that by using the exact anomaly sum rule , the high-@xmath3 behavior of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors is essentially determined by the well - known lowest order spectral representation of the triangle quark diagram .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the three form factors is possible and can be trusted .",
    "the application of the anomaly sum rule requires to relate the full - qcd spectral densities with the spectral densities obtained from perturbative qcd .",
    "this can be achieved by using the concept of duality . this way the anomaly sum rule offers the interesting possibility @xcite to calculate the transition form factors without referring to the qcd factorization theorem .",
    "no assumptions are needed about the light - cone distribution amplitudes of pseudoscalar mesons with their specific end - point behavior and gegenbauer coefficients .",
    "the high-@xmath3 behavior is determined by the high - energy dependence of the spectral density in the corresponding integrals , see eqs .",
    "( [ ct ] ) and ( [ ff ] ) below . at high energy  above the resonance region",
    " the spectral density can be very well approximated by perturbation theory .",
    "this spectral density is the same for the three form factors .",
    "( the effect of the difference between the current masses of strange and non strange quarks should be negligible at high energy ) .",
    "thus we can conclude that at high-@xmath3 the functional dependence of these form factors should be the same .",
    "a detailed analysis in @xcite suggests that the universality may be expected already at @xmath18 10 gev@xmath14 .",
    "different decay constants provide for different multiplication factors but do not affect the slope .",
    "looking now at the data , the following observations can be made :    \\(i ) the babar measurements of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 form factors ( fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] ) are within errors compatible with pqcd factorization which implies saturation of the combination @xmath19 .",
    "still , the data seem to indicate a very mild ( e.g. logarithmic ) rise with @xmath3 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     \\(iii ) the belle @xcite measurement of the @xmath6 form factor fig .",
    "[ plot:0 ] is within errors compatible with pqcd factorization which implies saturation of the combination @xmath19 .",
    "still , also these data seem to indicate a logarithmic rise with @xmath3 , but a very mild one like in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "we now apply our theoretical argument which states that the high-@xmath3 behavior of the three form factors should be the same . from the observations ( i ) , ( ii ) ( iii ) one can already conclude that this property is indeed seen in the data if for @xmath20 the belle data points are used .",
    "however , for a more quantitative analyses , the slight logarithmic rise indicated by the data should be taken into account .    to describe the logarithmic rise , the simplest use of the duality concept  a replacement of the absorptive part of the form factor beyond the resonance region by the lowest - order perturbative qcd spectral density ",
    "cannot be maintained : to account in a phenomenological way for higher - order effects , the lowest - order perturbative spectral density will be be multiplied by a correction factor @xmath21 which goes to one for high values of @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath22 denotes the square of the energy variable .",
    "it turns out that it is sufficient to describe @xmath23 as a simple function of a single fit parameter @xmath24 : @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath23 starts at the effective threshold relevant for each process .",
    "( for technical details see the next section ) . could be @xmath3-dependent , e.g. , @xmath26",
    ". this choice would restore saturation at large @xmath3 . ]    our simple model for the full set of the form factors thus involves six parameters : the three effective thresholds @xmath27 , @xmath28 for the @xmath5 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 components of the form factors and the three @xmath24 parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 . the decay constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the @xmath35mixing angle @xmath36 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    * the form factors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 *    let us first set @xmath37 , as implied by the pqcd factorization theorem .",
    "the fit to the existing data yields @xmath38 gev@xmath14 and @xmath39 gev@xmath14 with @xmath40 . strictly speaking , in view of the experimental data , further improvements are unnecessary",
    "nevertheless , having in mind the babar result for the pion form factor , let us allow also nonzero values of @xmath24 setting @xmath41 ( at the present accuracy of the data it makes no sense to treat them independently )",
    ". then the fitting procedure gives @xmath42 gev@xmath14 , @xmath43 gev@xmath14 and @xmath44 gev@xmath14 with @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] .",
    "notice that the threshold values obtained by the fits are not far from @xmath46 gev@xmath14 and @xmath47 gev@xmath14 suggested from the relevant elements of the @xmath35 mass matrix @xcite .",
    "* the @xmath48 form factor *    a fit to the data set containing the cleo and the babar results in fig .",
    "[ plot:0 ] leads to a much larger paramater @xmath49 gev@xmath14 than obtained for @xmath50 found above .",
    "the @xmath51 value is @xmath52 and the threshold parameter @xmath53 gev@xmath14 .",
    "most important , by setting @xmath54 one gets an extremely bad fit with @xmath55 .",
    "obviously , the babar high-@xmath3 data are not compatible with the asymptotic pqcd result at large @xmath3 ( 15 - 35 gev@xmath14 ) .",
    "in contrast , a fit to the data set containing the cleo and the belle data in fig .",
    "[ plot:0 ] is fully compatible with @xmath56 : for @xmath57 gev@xmath14 , one gets an excellent fit to the data with @xmath58 .",
    "no further improvements are necessary .",
    "nevertheless , allowing in addition for a nonzero parameter @xmath59 leads to @xmath60 gev@xmath14 and @xmath61 gev@xmath14 with @xmath62 .",
    "remarkably , this value of @xmath59 is equal to @xmath63 as obtained from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "also the effective thresholds for the nonstrange quark sector are very close to each other : @xmath64 .    the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ plot:0 ] corresponds to the variation of @xmath24 in the range 0.05 gev@xmath65 0.17 gev@xmath14 .",
    "to summarize , using the belle data for the large-@xmath3 region , the previously puzzling difference between the @xmath66 and @xmath4 form factors is no more present : all three processes  after taking particle mixing into account  can be well described by only two effective thresholds and a small universal parameter @xmath24 .",
    "certainly , more precise measurements are needed to establish a small logarithmic increase of @xmath19 for high @xmath3 values indicated by the data and parametrized by a nonzero @xmath67 gev@xmath14 .",
    "we now provide some details of our calculation of the @xmath68 form factors . for subtleties ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the amplitude @xmath69 here @xmath70 denote the photon polarization vectors .",
    "this amplitude is considered for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "its general decomposition contains four independent lorentz structures , but for our purpose only one structure is needed @xcite @xmath73 the invariant amplitude @xmath74 satisfies the spectral representations in @xmath75 at fixed @xmath3 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the physical spectral density and @xmath78 denotes the physical threshold .",
    "perturbation theory yields the spectral density as an expansion in powers of @xmath79 .",
    "the lowest order contribution , @xmath80 , corresponds to the one - loop triangle diagram with the axial current and two vector currents in the vertices @xcite @xmath81 ,   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad w=\\sqrt{1- 4 m^2/s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath82 denotes the mass of the quark propagating in the loop .",
    "the integral of @xmath80 from @xmath83 to infinity is independent of @xmath82 and @xmath3 and gives the axial anomaly @xcite @xmath84 according to the adler - bardeen theorem @xcite , radiative corrections to the anomaly vanish : higher order qcd calculation can change @xmath85 but not the integral .",
    "non - perturbative qcd effects strongly distort @xmath77 compared with @xmath80 in the low-@xmath22 region : a meson pole and the hadron continuum are generated .",
    "nevertheless , the integral of the entire absorptive part @xmath77 remains unchanged , still representing the anomaly : @xmath86 for the case of the isovector @xmath87 axial current the spectrum contains the @xmath48-meson pole .",
    "the physical absorptive part of @xmath74 reads @xmath88 here @xmath89 denotes the hadron - continuum contribution in the isovector channel . in ( [ aps2 ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath6 form factor we are interested in appears together with the @xmath0 meson @xmath90-function and the pion decay constant .",
    "the anomaly sum rule for @xmath91 then takes the form @xmath92.\\ ] ] for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 form factors , one has to consider the isoscalar currents @xmath93 and @xmath94 , separately .",
    "the formulae for @xmath95 and @xmath96 are identical to ( [ pigamma ] ) except for the replacements @xmath97 by @xmath34 and @xmath33 and @xmath98 by @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .    for each channel , the relevant threshold @xmath78 should be used .",
    "taking @xmath101 mixing @xcite into account leads to @xmath102 the @xmath101 mixing angle @xmath36 is known to be @xmath103 ; the decay constants are taken to be @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "according to ( [ pigamma ] ) and ( [ etaeta ] ) , the calculation of the @xmath68 form factors requires an ansatz for the continuum spectral densities @xmath105 for all three cases .",
    "the quark - hadron duality suggests that at large values of @xmath22 , above the resonance region , the hadron spectral density should be very close to the perturbative qcd spectral density .",
    "we therefore use the simple ansatz @xmath106 it turns out @xcite that for the large-@xmath3 behavior of the form factor the behaviour of @xmath23 at large @xmath22 is essential : e.g. in order to have the logarithmic rise of @xmath107 , @xmath23 should contain a @xmath108-correction : for @xmath109 starting at a finite energy @xmath110 , @xmath111 , one finds @xmath112 notice that the part of the integral ( [ pigamma ] ) from @xmath78 to @xmath110 scales as @xmath113 and is therefore not relevant for the effect discussed here . thus , neither the details of @xmath23 at small @xmath22 nor the presence of higher powers of @xmath108 affect this behavior .",
    "the negative linear term @xmath114 in @xmath23 is responsible for the logarithmic increase .",
    "if absent , the form factor scales as @xmath115 .",
    "evidently , for a universal @xmath24 the high-@xmath3 behavior of all three form factors turns out to be the same . for small @xmath24 ,",
    "the differences due to different thresholds and decay constants affect the magnitude of the form factors but not their slope .",
    "we revisited the @xmath68 transition form factors , @xmath116 , with special emphasis on the new data on the @xmath4 form factor reported by belle @xcite .",
    "use is made of the exact anomaly sum rule which relates the integral over the hadron spectrum to the axial anomaly .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the qcd factorization theorem and the meson distribution amplitudes do not enter the analyses .",
    "thus , the three processes can be easily compared with each other .",
    "@xmath117 we report that the @xmath118 form factors of @xmath119 and @xmath2 are fully compatible with each other  if for the @xmath4 form factor the recent belle data are applied : the parameter @xmath24 and the effective threshold used in the description for the @xmath5 nonstrange continuum and the ones for the @xmath29 continuum agree with each other .",
    "thus , the belle data resolve the puzzle of a qualitatively different behavior of the nonstrange component in @xmath1 and @xmath2 on one hand and of @xmath0 on the other hand .",
    "@xmath117 still , our _ best _ fits to the data  for all three processes  suggest a slight increase of the product @xmath107 at high @xmath3 .",
    "if confirmed by future experiments , this would put qcd factorization into question and would suggest that the full spectral density of the dispersion representation for the form factor is dual to the lowest order pqcd spectral density only by including an effective @xmath108-correction term .    _",
