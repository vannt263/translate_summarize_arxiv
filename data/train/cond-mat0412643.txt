    "the extraordinary variety of carbon allotropes , as well as their present and potential applications in such diverse fields as nanoelectronics@xcite or bioengineering@xcite , gives them a special place among all the elements . even excluding fullerenes , nanotubes , and their derivatives , single crystalline diamond , graphite and graphene ( i.e. a single graphite layer ) still lack a complete characterization of their thermodynamic stability under a broad range of conditions ( see e.g. refs .   and citations therein ) . in this respect ,",
    "vibrational properties play a crucial role in determining the thermodynamic properties of the bulk . indeed , diamond being a wide band gap material ( e@xmath4= 5.5 ev ) , electronic excitations do not account for thermal properties up to high temperatures .",
    "graphite and graphene are semi - metals , but the gap vanishes only at the k point where the two massless bands cross ( see e.g. ref .  ) ; thus , electronic excitations can also be neglected in these materials , and the phonon dispersions provide all the information that is needed to calculate thermodynamical quantities such as the thermal expansion or specific heat .    the aim of this paper is to provide a converged , accurate determination of the structural , dynamical , and thermodynamical properties of diamond , graphite , graphene and rhombohedral graphite from first - principles calculations .",
    "although the phonon spectrum of diamond and its thermal properties have been studied extensively with experiments @xcite and calculations@xcite , the phonon spectrum of graphite is still under active investigation@xcite , as well as its thermal properties .",
    "graphite in - plane thermal expansion has long been recognized to be negative@xcite , and it has even been suggested@xcite that this may be due to the internal stresses related to the large expansion in the @xmath5 direction ( poisson effect ) . to resolve some of the open questions , and to provide a coherent picture for these materials , we used extensive ab - initio density - functional theory ( dft ) and density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt)@xcite calculations .",
    "dft is a very efficient and accurate tool to obtain ground - state and linear - response properties , especially when paired with plane - wave basis sets , which easily allow to reach full convergence with respect to basis size , and ultrasoft pseudo - potentials@xcite for optimal performance and transferability .",
    "we adopted the pbe - gga@xcite exchange - correlation functional , at variance with most of the early studies on diamond@xcite and especially graphite@xcite , which have been performed using the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "gga calculations have appeared mostly for the cases of diamond ( gga - pbe , ref .  ) and graphene ( gga - pbe , refs .  ) , with some data for graphite appearing in refs .",
    "( gga - pbe ) .",
    "dfpt@xcite is then used to compute the phonon frequencies at any arbitrary wave - vector , without having to resort to the use of supercells .",
    "the vibrational free energy is calculated in the quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha)@xcite , to predict finite - temperature lattice properties such as thermal expansion and specific heat .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first study on the thermal properties of graphite or graphene from first - principles . for the case of diamond and graphene , calculations are fully ab - initio and do not require any experimental input . for the case of graphite and rhombohedral graphite we argue that the use of the experimental @xmath0 greatly improves the agreement with experimental data .",
    "this experimental input is required since dft , in its current state of development , yields poor predictions for the interlayer interactions , dominated by van der waals dispersion forces not well described by local or semi - local exchange correlation functionals ( see refs .   and   for details ; the agreement between lda predictions and experimental results for the @xmath0 ratio is fortuitous ) .",
    "it is found that the weak interlayer bonding has a small influence on most of the properties studied and that forcing the experimental @xmath0 corrects almost all the remaining ones .",
    "this allowed us to obtain results for all the materials considered that are in very good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "the article is structured as follows .",
    "we give a brief summary of our approach and definitions and introduce dfpt and the qha in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "our ground - state , zero - temperature results for diamond , graphite , graphene and rhombohedral graphite are presented in section  [ sec3 ] : lattice parameters and elastic constants from the equations of state in subsection  [ sec3:sub1 ] , phonon frequencies and vibrational density of states in subsection  [ sec3:sub2 ] , and first - principles , linear - response interatomic force constants in subsection  [ sec3:sub3 ] .",
    "the lattice thermal properties , such as thermal expansion , mode grneisen parameters , and specific heat as obtained from the vibrational free energy are presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] contains our final remarks .",
    "in density - functional theory@xcite the ground state electronic density and wavefunctions of a crystal are found by solving self - consistently a set of one - electron equations . in atomic units ( used throughout the article ) , these are    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the occupation function , @xmath10 the fermi energy , @xmath11 the exchange - correlation functional ( approximated by gga - pbe in our case ) , @xmath12 the electronic - density , and @xmath13 the ionic core potential ( actually a sum over an array of pseudo - potentials ) .",
    "once the unperturbed ground state is determined , phonon frequencies can be obtained from the interatomic force constants , i.e. the second derivatives at equilibrium of the total crystal energy versus displacements of the ions :    @xmath14    here * r * ( * r* ) is a bravais lattice vector , i ( j ) indicates the i@xmath15 ( j@xmath15 ) atom of the unit cell , and @xmath16 represents the cartesian components .",
    "@xmath17 are the second derivatives@xcite of ewald sums corresponding to the ion - ion repulsion potential , while the electronic contributions @xmath18 are the second derivatives of the electron - electron and electron - ion terms in the ground state energy . from the hellmann - feynman@xcite theorem",
    "one obtains :    @xmath19 d^3 \\textbf{r } \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( where the dependence of both @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the displacements has been omitted for clarity , and @xmath13 is considered local ) .",
    "it is seen that the electronic contribution can be obtained from the knowledge of the linear response of the system to a displacement .",
    "the key assumption is then the born - oppenheimer approximation which views a lattice vibration as a static perturbation on the electrons .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the response time of the electrons is much shorter than that of ions , that is , each time ions are slightly displaced by a phonon , electrons instantaneously rearrange themselves in the state of minimum energy of the new ionic configuration . therefore , static linear response theory can be applied to describe the behavior of electrons upon a vibrational excitation .    for phonon calculations ,",
    "we consider a periodic perturbation @xmath20 of wave - vector * q * , which modifies the self - consistent potential @xmath21 by an amount @xmath22 .",
    "the linear response in the charge density @xmath23 can be found using first - order perturbation theory .",
    "if we consider its fourier transform @xmath24 , and calling @xmath25 the one - particle wavefunction of an electron in the occupied band `` @xmath26 '' at the point * k * of the brillouin zone ( and @xmath27 the corresponding eigenvalue ) , one can get a self - consistent set of linear equations similar to eqs .",
    "( [ ks1],[ks2],[ks3])@xcite :    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30_{n_0(\\textbf{r})}\\\\\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta v_{ion}(\\textbf{r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath31 refers to the projector on the empty - state manifold at @xmath32 , @xmath33 to the total crystal volume , and * g * to any reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "note that the linear response contains only fourier components of wave vector @xmath34 , so we added a superscript * q * to @xmath35 .",
    "we have implicitly assumed for simplicity that the crystal has a band gap and that pseudo - potentials are local , but the generalization to metals@xcite and to non - local pseudo - potentials@xcite are all well established ( see ref .   for a detailed and complete review of dfpt ) .",
    "linear - response theory allows us to calculate the response to any periodic perturbation ; i.e. it allows direct access to the dynamical matrix related to the interatomic force constants via a fourier transform :    @xmath36    ( where @xmath37 is the mass of the i@xmath15 atom ) .",
    "phonon frequencies at any * q * are the solutions of the eigenvalue problem :    @xmath38    in practice , one calculates the dynamical matrix on a relatively coarse grid in the brillouin zone ( say , a @xmath39 grid for diamond ) , and obtains the corresponding interatomic force constants by inverse fourier transform ( in this example it would correspond to a @xmath39 supercell in real space ) . finally , the dynamical matrix ( and phonon frequencies ) at any * q * point can be obtained by fourier interpolation of the real - space interatomic force constants .      when no external pressure is applied to a crystal",
    ", the equilibrium structure at any temperature t can be found by minimizing the helmholtz free energy @xmath40 with respect to all its geometrical degrees of freedom @xmath41 .",
    "if now the crystal is supposed to be perfectly harmonic , f is the sum of the ground state total energy and the vibrational free energy coming from the partition function ( in the canonical ensemble ) of a collection of independent harmonic oscillators . in a straightforward manner",
    ", it can be shown@xcite that :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the ground state energy and the sums run over all the brillouin zone wave - vectors and the band index @xmath44 of the phonon dispersion .",
    "the second term in the right hand side of eq.([free ] ) is the zero - point motion .",
    "if anharmonic effects are neglected , the phonon frequencies do not depend on lattice parameters , therefore the free energy dependence on structure is entirely contained in the ground state equation of state @xmath43 .",
    "consequently the structure does not depend on temperature in a harmonic crystal .",
    "thermal expansion is recovered by introducing in eq.([free ] ) the dependence of the phonon frequencies on the structural parameters @xmath41 ; direct minimization of the free energy @xmath45 provides the equilibrium structure at any temperature t. this approach goes under the name quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha ) and has been applied successfully to many bulk systems@xcite .",
    "the linear thermal expansion coefficients of the cell dimensions of a lattice are then    @xmath46    the grneisen formalism@xcite assumes a linear dependence of the phonon frequencies on the three orthogonal cell dimensions @xmath41 ; developing the ground state energy up to second order , ( thanks to the equation of state at @xmath47 ) , one can get from the condition @xmath48 the alternative expression    @xmath49    we follow here the formalism of ref .  :",
    "@xmath50 is the contribution to the specific heat from the mode @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the elastic compliance matrix , and the subscript `` @xmath53 '' indicates a quantity taken at the ground state lattice parameter .",
    "the grneisen parameter of the mode @xmath51 is by definition    @xmath54    for a structure which depends only on one lattice parameter @xmath55 ( e.g. diamond or graphene ) one then gets for the linear thermal expansion coefficient @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 ( @xmath33 represents the volume of a three - dimensional crystal such as diamond or the surface of a two - dimensional one like graphene ) , d is the number of dimensions ( @xmath59 for diamond , @xmath60 for graphene ) , and @xmath61 is the volume ( or the surface ) at equilibrium .    in the case of graphite",
    "there are two lattice parameters : @xmath55 in the basal plane and @xmath5 perpendicular to the basal plane , so that one gets    @xmath62    @xmath63    the mode grneisen parameters provide useful insight to the thermal expansion mechanisms .",
    "they are usually positive , since phonon frequencies decrease when the solid expands , although some negative mode grneisen parameters for low - frequency acoustic modes can arise and sometimes compete with the positive ones , giving a negative thermal expansion at low temperatures , when only the lowest acoustic modes can be excited .",
    "finally , the heat capacity of the unit cell at constant volume can be obtained from @xmath64 @xcite :    @xmath65      all the calculations that follow were performed using the espresso@xcite package , which is a full ab - initio dft and dfpt code available under the gnu public license@xcite .",
    "we used a plane - wave basis set , ultrasoft pseudo - potentials@xcite from the standard distribution@xcite ( generated using a modified rrkj@xcite approach ) , and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional in its pbe parameterization@xcite .",
    "we also used the local density approximation ( lda ) in order to compare some results between the two functionals . in this case",
    "the parameterization used was the one proposed by perdew and zunger@xcite .",
    "for the semi - metallic graphite and graphene cases , we used 0.03 ryd of cold smearing @xcite .",
    "we carefully and extensively checked the convergence in the energy differences between different configurations and the phonon frequencies with respect to the wavefunction cutoff , the dual ( i.e. the ratio between charge density cutoff and wavefunction cutoff ) , the k - point sampling of the brillouin zone , and the interlayer vacuum spacing for graphene .",
    "energy differences were converged within 5 mev / atom or better , and phonon frequencies within @xmath66 . in the case of graphite and graphene phonon frequencies",
    "were converged with respect to the k - point sampling after having set the smearing parameter at 0.03 ryd .",
    "besides , values of the smearing between 0.02 ryd and 0.04 ryd did not change the frequencies by more than @xmath66 .    in a solid , translational invariance guaranties that three phonon frequencies at @xmath2 will go to zero . in our gga - pbe dfpt formalism",
    "this condition is exactly satisfied only in the limit of infinite k - point sampling and full convergence with the plane - wave cutoff . for the case of graphene and graphite we found in particular",
    "that an exceedingly large cutoff ( 100 ryd ) and dual ( 28 ) would be needed to recover phonon dispersions ( especially around @xmath2 and the @xmath67 branch ) with the tolerances mentioned ; on the other hand , application of the acoustic sum rule ( i.e. forcing the translational symmetry on the interatomic force constants ) allows us to recover these highly converged calculations above with a more reasonable cutoff and dual .",
    "finally , the cutoffs we used were 40 ryd for the wavefunctions in all the carbon materials presented , with duals of 8 for diamond and 12 for graphite and graphene .",
    "we used a @xmath68 monkhorst - pack k - mesh for diamond , @xmath69 for graphite , @xmath70 for rhombohedral graphite and @xmath71 for graphene .",
    "all these meshes were unshifted ( i.e. they do include @xmath2 ) .",
    "dynamical matrices were initially calculated on a @xmath68 q - points mesh for diamond , @xmath72 for graphite , @xmath73 for rhombohedral graphite and @xmath74 for graphene .",
    "finally , integrations over the brillouin zone for the vibrational free energy or the heat capacity were done using phonon frequencies that were fourier interpolated on much finer meshes .",
    "the phonon frequencies were usually computed at several lattice parameters and the results interpolated to get their dependence on lattice constants .",
    "a final remark is that we were careful to use the same parameters ( cutoffs , k - points sampling , smearing , etc . ) in the determination of the ground state equation of state and that of the phonon frequencies , since these two terms need to be added in the free energy expression .",
    "we performed ground state total - energy calculations on diamond , graphite , and graphene over a broad range of lattice parameters .",
    "the potential energy surface can then be fitted by an appropriate equation of state .",
    "the minimum gives the ground state equilibrium lattice parameter(s ) .",
    "the second derivatives at that minimum are related to the bulk modulus or elastic constants .    for the case of diamond",
    "we chose the birch equation of state@xcite ( up to the fourth order ) to fit the total energy vs. the lattice constant @xmath55 :    @xmath75 ^ 2 + a \\left [ \\left ( \\frac { a_0}{a } \\right ) ^2 -1 \\right ] ^3 \\\\ & & + b \\left [ \\left ( \\frac { a_0}{a } \\right ) ^2 -1 \\right ] ^4 + \\mathcal{o}\\left ( \\left ( \\frac { a_0}{a } \\right ) ^2 -1 \\right ) ^5\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the bulk modulus , @xmath61 the primitive cell volume ( @xmath76 here ) and @xmath3 and @xmath77 are fit parameters .",
    "the murnaghan equation of state or even a polynomial would fit equally well the calculations around the minimum of the curve .",
    "a best fit of this equation on our data gives us both the equilibrium lattice parameter and the bulk modulus ; our results are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the agreement with the experimental values is very good , even after the zero - point motion and thermal expansion are added to our theoretical predictions ( see section  [ sec4 ] ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the overall agreement with experiment is good to very good .",
    "lda leads to larger elastic constants , as expected from the general tendency to `` overbind '' , but still agrees well with experiment . for diamond ,",
    "the agreement is particularly good . as for @xmath80 in graphite",
    ", it is quite difficult to obtain it from the dispersion curves since it enters the sound velocities only in a linear combination involving other elastic constants , for which the error is almost comparable to the magnitude of @xmath80 itself .",
    "an accurate description of the phonon dispersions allow us to predict the low - energy structural excitations and thus several thermodynamical quantities . before exploring this in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we want to discuss the nature and decay of the interatomic force constants in carbon based materials .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec2:sub1 ] , the interatomic force constants @xmath81 are obtained in our calculations from the fourier transform of the dynamical matrix @xmath82 calculated on a regular mesh inside the brillouin zone ( @xmath68 for diamond , @xmath72 for graphite and @xmath83 for graphene ) .",
    "this procedure is exactly equivalent ( but much more efficient ) than calculating the interatomic force constants with frozen phonons ( up to 47 neighbors in diamond and 74 in graphene ) . at a given @xmath84",
    ", @xmath85 is actually a @xmath86 order tensor , and the decay of its norm ( defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of all the matrix elements ) with distance is a good measure to know the effect of distant neighbors . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have plotted the natural logarithm of such a norm with respect to the distance from a given atom , for diamond and graphene . the norm has been averaged on all the neighbors located at the same distance before taking the logarithm .",
    "decay of the norm of the interatomic force constants as a function of distance for diamond ( thin solid line ) and graphene ( thick solid line ) , in a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines show the decay for diamond along the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) directions . ]",
    "the force - constants decay in graphene is slower than in diamond , and it depends much less on direction . in diamond decay along ( 110 ) is much slower than in other directions due to long - range elastic effects along the covalent bonds .",
    "this long - range decay is also responsible for the flattening of the phonon dispersions in zincblende and diamond semiconductors along the k - x line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and ref .  , for instance ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig7 ] we show the decay plot for graphite and graphene , averaged over all directions .",
    "the graphite interatomic force constants include values corresponding to graphene ( in - plane nearest neighbors ) and smaller values corresponding to the weak interlayer interactions .",
    "decay of the norm of the interatomic force constants as a function of distance for graphite ( thin solid line ) and graphene ( thick solid line ) . ]",
    "it is interesting to assess the effects of the truncation of these interatomic force constants on the phonon dispersion curves .",
    "this can be done by replacing the force constants corresponding to distant neighbors by zero . in this way",
    "the relevance of short - range and long - range contributions can be examined .",
    "the former are relevant for short - range force - constant models such as the vff ( valence force field)@xcite or the 4nnfc ( 4@xmath15 nearest - neighbor force constant)@xcite used e.g. in graphene .",
    "note however that a simple truncation is not comparable to the vff or 4nnfc models , where effective interatomic force constants would be renormalized .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] show the change in frequency for selected modes in diamond and graphene as a function of the truncation range .",
    "the modes we chose are those most strongly affected by the number of neighbors included .    for diamond ,",
    "our whole supercell contains up to 47 neighbors , and the graph shows only the region up to 20 neighbors included , since the selected modes do not vary by more than @xmath87 after that . with 5 neighbors ,",
    "phonon frequencies are already near their converged value , being off by at worst 4% off ; very good accuracy ( @xmath88 ) is obtained with 13 neighbors .    for graphene , our @xmath89 supercell contains up to 74 neighbors , but after the 30@xmath15 no relevant changes occur .",
    "at least 4 neighbors are needed for the optical modes to be converged within 5 - 8% .",
    "some acoustic modes require more neighbors , as also pointed out in ref .  .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the frequency of some za modes in the @xmath2-m branch ( at about one fourth of the branch ) oscillates strongly with the number of neighbors included , and can even become imaginary when less than 13 are used , resulting into an instability of the crystal .",
    "this behavior does not appear in diamond .",
    "also , the @xmath90 mode keeps varying in going down from 20 to 30 neighbors , though this effect remains small ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this drift could signal the presence of a kohn anomaly@xcite .",
    "indeed , at the @xmath92 point of the brillouin zone the electronic band gap vanishes in graphene , so that a singularity arises in the highest optical phonon mode .",
    "therefore a finer q - point mesh is needed around this point , and longer - ranged interatomic force constants .",
    "this effect is discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "phonon frequencies of diamond as a function of the number of neighbors included in the interatomic force constants : @xmath93 ( solid line ) , @xmath94 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath95 ( dashed line ) . ]    phonon frequencies of graphene as a function of the number of neighbors included in the interatomic force constants : @xmath96 ( solid line ) , @xmath90 ( dot - dashed ) , @xmath97 ( dashed ) , and for the dotted line a phonon mode in the za branch one - fourth along the @xmath2 to m line . ]",
    "we present in this final section our results on the thermodynamical properties of diamond , graphite and graphene using the quasi - harmonic approximation and phonon dispersions at the gga level .",
    "as outlined in section  [ sec2:sub2 ] we first perform a direct minimization over the lattice parameter(s ) @xmath41 of the vibrational free energy @xmath98 ( eq .  [ free_quasi ] ) .",
    "this gives us , for any temperature t , the equilibrium lattice parameter(s ) , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] . for diamond and graphene , we used in eq .",
    "[ free_quasi ] the equations of state obtained from the ground state calculations presented in section  [ sec3:sub1 ] . for graphite",
    "this choice would not be useful or accurate , since the theoretical @xmath0 is much larger than the experimental one .",
    "so we _ forced _ the equation of state to be a minimum for @xmath55=4.65 a.u . and @xmath99=2.725 ( fixing only @xmath0 and relaxing @xmath55 would give @xmath55=4.66 a.u . , with negligible effects on the thermal expansion ) .",
    "in particular , our `` corrected '' equation of state is obtained by fitting with a fourth order polynomial the true equation of state around the experimental @xmath55 and @xmath0 , and then dropping from this polynomial the linear order terms . since the second derivatives of the polynomial are unchanged , this is to say we keep the elastic constants unchanged .",
    "the only input from experiments remains the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "we have also checked the effect of imposing to @xmath80 its experimental value ( @xmath80 is the elastic constant that is less accurately predicted ) , but the changes were small .",
    "the dependence of the phonon frequencies on the lattice parameters was determined by calculating the whole phonon dispersions at several values and interpolating these in between . for diamond and graphene",
    "we used four different values of @xmath55 ( from 6.76 to 6.85 a.u . for diamond , and from 4.654 to 4.668 a.u . for graphene ) and interpolated them with a cubic polynomial .",
    "for graphite , since the minimization space is two dimensional , we restricted ourselves to a linear interpolation and calculated the phonon dispersions at three different combinations of the lattice constants : @xmath100=(4.659,2.725 ) , ( 4.659,2.9 ) and ( 4.667,2.725 ) .",

    "ab - initio out - of - plane mode grneisen parameters for graphite . ]",
    "while not visible in the figure , the grneisen parameter for the lowest acoustic branch of graphite becomes as low as -40 , and as low as -80 for graphene .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures ( where most optical modes with positive grneisen parameters are still not excited ) the contribution from the negative grneisen parameters will be predominant and thermal expansion ( from eq .",
    "[ grun_1d ] ) negative .",
    "the negative grneisen parameters correspond to the lowest transversal acoustic ( za ) modes , and in the case of graphite to the ( zo ) modes , which can be described as `` acoustic '' inside the layer and optical out - of - plane ( see section  [ sec3:sub2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the phonon frequencies for such modes increase when the in - plane lattice parameter is increased , contrary to the usual behavior , because the layer is more `` stretched '' when @xmath55 is increased , and atoms in that layer will be less free to move in the z direction ( just like a rope that is stretched will have vibrations of smaller amplitude , and higher frequency ) . in graphite these parameters are less negative because of the interaction between layers : atoms are less free to move in the z - direction than in the case of graphene .",
    "this effect , known as the `` membrane effect '' , was predicted by lifshitz@xcite in 1952 , when he pointed out the role of these za modes ( also called `` bending modes '' ) in layered materials .",
    "in particular , several recent studies have highlighted the relevance of these modes to the thermal properties of layered crystals such as graphite , boron nitride and gallium sulfide@xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the equilibrium lattice constant(s ) at any temperature allows us also to calculate the dependence of elastic constants on temperature .",
    "to do so we calculated the second derivatives of the free energy ( eq .  [ free_quasi ] ) vs. lattice constant(s ) at the finite - temperature equilibrium lattice parameter(s ) .",
    "we checked that this was equivalent to a best fit of the free energy at t around the equilibrium lattice parameter(s ) .",
    "results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig20 ] and [ fig21 ] ( diamond and graphite respectively ) .",
    "again , the zero - point motion has a significant impact on the elastic constants ; the agreement with experimental data for the temperature dependence of the ratio of the bulk modulus of diamond to its 298 k value is excellent ( upper panel of fig .  [ fig20 ] ) .",
    "we note that the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus of diamond has already been obtained by karch _",
    "_ et al__@xcite using lda calculations .",

    "the filled circle indicates the value of the bulk modulus ( as in table  [ tab1 ] ) before accounting for zero - point motion .",

    "the filled circles ( at 0 k ) indicate their ground state values ( as in table  [ tab2 ] ) before accounting for zero - point motion . ]    as final thermodynamic quantities , we present results on the heat capacities for all the systems considered , at constant volume ( @xmath107 ) and constant pressure ( @xmath108 ) .",

    "all these quantities were taken from our ab - initio results and evaluated at each of the temperatures considered .",
    "the difference between @xmath108 and @xmath107 is very small , at most about 2% of the value of @xmath107 for graphite and 5% for diamond .",

    "were found to be in good agreement with experimental results provided the calculations were performed at the experimental @xmath0 .",
    "only the c@xmath111 constant remains in poor agreement with experimental data .",

    "it was shown that interactions in the ( 110 ) direction in diamond are longer - ranged than these in other directions , as is characteristic of the zincblende and diamond structures .",
