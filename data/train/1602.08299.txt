    "the concept of population coupling is tested on two different types of neural data .",
    "one is the firing neural activities of retinal ganglion cells under natural movie stimuli .",
    "the other is the population activities of medial prefrontal cortex when a rat was performing odor - place matching working memory tasks .    for the retinal data , on average @xmath14 accounts for more than @xmath91 of pairwise correlations , and @xmath16 accounts for over @xmath92 of three - cell correlations .",
    "the interaction matrix of @xmath16 contains information about the functional interaction features in the retinal circuitry .",
    "it seems that a retinal neuron can be paired with not only negatively strong couplings , but also slightly positive couplings .",
    "only a few pairs of neurons have strong correlations with the global activity of the population .",
    "to describe the spike synchrony distribution , @xmath16 performs better than @xmath14 , nevertheless , both of them could not capture the trend of the tail ( rare events related to higher order interactions existing in the network ) .",
    "this is not surprising , because @xmath14 and @xmath16 are simplified descriptions of the original high dimensional neural activity , taking the trade - off between the computation complexity and the description goodness .    to extract the statistical structure embedded in the neural population ,",
    "@xmath16 improves significantly over @xmath14 , and has further additional benefit of describing the third - order correlations observed in the data , as @xmath16 could be used to construct triplet interactions among neurons , although direct constructing all possible triplet interactions is extremely computationally difficult .    unlike the retinal circuit , the cortical circuit yields a much smaller absolute value of the multi - information , implying that no significant higher order correlations ( interactions ) were present in the neural circuit when the circuit was carrying out task - related information processing rather than encoding well - structured stimuli ( as in the retinal network )",
    "this also explains why a simplified description such as @xmath14 and @xmath16 is accurate enough to capture the main features of the population activity , including the spike synchrony distribution .",
    "the inferred model on the cortical data reveals a different interaction map from that of the retinal circuit . in the cortical circuit",
    ", neurons form the stripe - like structure in the interaction matrix , suggesting that these neurons may receive a large number of excitatory inputs  @xcite .",
    "these inputs may come from different layers of cortex , and they can execute top - down or bottom - up information processing , thus modulate the global brain state in the target cortex during behavioral tasks .    before summary of this work",
    ", i made some discussions about two relevant recent studies on population coupling ( see _ notes added _ ) .",
    "@xcite modeled directly the joint probability distribution of individual neural response and population rate ( the number of neurons simultaneously active ) by linear coupling and complete coupling models .",
    "the linear coupling reproduces separately the distribution of individual neuronal state and the population rate distribution , and their couplings , while @xmath14 introduced in my work reproduces mean firing rate and the correlation between individual neuronal state and the background population activity ( except the neuron itself ) . note that @xmath14 does not model population rate distribution explicitly , which is hard to interpret in terms of functional connectivity .",
    "the complete - coupling model reproduces the joint probability distributions between the response of each neuron and the population rate , from which it is hard to conclude that the high - order interactions responsible for high - order correlations can be interpreted and tested .",
    "however , @xmath16 reproduces mean firing rate and the correlation between neuron - pair activities and the background population activity ( except the neuron - pair itself ) , and thus explains high - order correlations by an energy model .",
    "furthermore , in this sense , this work overcame a weakness pointed out in another independent later work of population coupling  @xcite , which fitted directly the population rate distribution and the firing probability for each neuron conditioned on the population rate , and analogously the corresponding model parameters can not be readily interpretable in a biological setting . due to intrinsic difference in model definitions ,",
    "these two relevant works have nice properties of studying tuning curves of individual neurons to the population rate , and sampling from the model to reproduce the population synchrony distribution .    in summary ,",
    "i develop a theoretical model of population coupling and its advanced form , to relate the correlation profile in the neural collective activity to the basic circuit variables .",
    "the practical dimensional reduction method is tested on different types of neural data , and specific features of neural circuit are revealed .",
    "this model aiming at describing high order correlations with a low order representation , is expected to be useful for modeling big neural data .",
    "note that the interaction matrices shown in fig .",
    "[ retinapc2 ] and fig .",
    "[ mpcpc2 ] are qualitatively robust to changes of the data size to only the first half ( data not shown ) , verifying that the revealed features are not an artifact of overfitting .",
    "however , it still deserves further studies by introducing regularization in the learning equation .",
    "it is also very interesting to incorporate more physiologically plausible parameters to explain how the collective spiking behavior arises from the microscopic interactions among the basic units .",
    "another interesting study is to clarify the role of higher order correlations in decoding performances based on maximum likelihood principles  @xcite .",
