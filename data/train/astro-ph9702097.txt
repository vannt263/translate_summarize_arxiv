    "the sample of all known gravitational lenses is by now dominated by stellar microlenses in our galaxy ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; udalski et al . 1994 ; ansari et al . 1996",
    "; alard 1996 ) .",
    "even galactic _ macro_-lenses of quasars are often accompanied by microlensing events due to stars ( irwin et al .",
    "1989 ; schild and smith 1991 ; schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 and references therein ) , and thus emphasize that microlensing is a common phenomenon .",
    "based on the fact that a solar mass lens at a distance @xmath0 offers an angular resolution @xmath1micro - arcsec , microlensing has long been recognized as a potential tool for resolving the surface brightness distribution of compact sources .    nevertheless , most stellar sources are smaller than the effective size of their lenses .",
    "the finite extent of a stellar photosphere ( @xmath2 ) is still much smaller than the einstein radius of a solar mass lens [ @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the lens mass ] , and so the lightcurve of galactic microlenses typically carries little information about the brightness distribution of the source ( paczyski 1986 ; udalski et al .",
    "the point source approximation breaks down only when the projected impact parameter is comparable to the finite size of the source .",
    "although such circumstances are realized in a minority of all microlensing events , they carry a large scientific payoff",
    ". a spectroscopic identification of the source size and distance in such a case , could break the parameter degeneracy of the microlensing lightcurve and reveal the einstein angle of the lens ( loeb & sasselov 1995 ; gould & welch 1996 ) .",
    "the appearance of extended source signatures should be common when giant stars are microlensed by planets ( loeb & sasselov 1995 ; bennett & rhie 1996 ) . by now , there are some examples of lightcurves with unusually high amplification ( i.e. small impact parameter ) or short duration ( i.e. low lens masses ) in which there are hints of finite source signatures ( mao et al .",
    "1994 ; lennon et al . 1996 ; bennett et al . 1996",
    "; pratt 1996 ; alcock et al .",
    "searches for microlensing by planets ( albrow et al .",
    "1996 ; pratt et al .",
    "1996 ) are likely to add more examples to this class of events in the future .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of finite source events could ultimately test the theory of stellar photospheres , especially for giant stars ( loeb & sasselov 1995 ; sasselov 1996 ) .",
    "an analogous ordering of scales appears in stellar microlensing of the continuum emission from quasars . for a star of mass @xmath4 ,",
    "the einstein radius at a cosmological distance is of order @xmath5 . in comparison ,",
    "the optical continuum emission in quasars is believed to originate from a compact accretion disk .",
    "the uv bump observed in quasar spectra is often interpreted as thermal emission at a disk temperature @xmath6 ( e.g. laor 1990 ) , and so the scale of the disk emission region must be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the corresponding luminosity of the quasar in units of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , for lens masses @xmath10 , the continuum source is much smaller than the projected einstein radius of the lens .",
    "this expectation is indeed confirmed in the lenses of q2237 + 0305 ( irwin et al .",
    "1989 ) and 0957 + 561 ( schild & smith 1991 ) , where variability due to microlensing has been detected ( wambsganss , paczyski , & schneider 1990 ; rauch & blandford 1991 ; racine 1991 ; gould & miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the above ordering of scales is reversed for the broad emission line regions of quasars .",
    "reverberation studies of the time lag between variations in the continuum and the line emission in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) indicate that the broad emission lines originate at a distance of @xmath11 ( peterson 1993 ; maoz 1996 ) .",
    "this implies that the broad lines could be amplified through stellar microlensing only for low ",
    "luminosity agn ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "microlensing of seyfert galaxies offers a unique opportunity for resolving the unknown structure and velocity distribution of the broad line region in agn .    for all of the above applications ,",
    "it is important to find the amplification in a variety of source and lens geometries .",
    "evaluating the net amplification of an extended source involves a two  dimensional integral over its surface brightness distribution .",
    "a direct calculation of this integral raises some numerical problems ( due to the divergence of the amplification at the lens position ) and is computationally time consuming .",
    "witt & mao ( 1994 ) expressed the amplification of a circular source with uniform brightness in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "alternatively , the amplification of uniform sources can be computed in the image plane , avoiding the divergence .",
    "realistic sources , however , have a non  uniform surface brightness distribution ( e.g. due to limb  darkening in stellar atmospheres ) that also depends on the observed wavelength ( loeb & sasselov 1995 ; gould & welch 1996 ; sasselov 1996 ) .",
    "witt & mao ( 1994 ) proposed to sum over rings using the derivative of the brightness distribution as the appropriate weight for their contributions to the overall amplification .",
    "as a result , they traded one dimension in their surface integration for the evaluation of their elliptic integral solution .",
    "other methods , such as image plane integration , require approximating nonuniform sources as a superposition of uniform sources . in this work ,",
    "we propose another , more efficient approach to microlensing of nonuniform sources .",
    "we show how to analytically reduce the surface integral to one dimension for elliptically symmetric brightness profiles .",
    "this generalization can therefore be used to calculate microlensing of inclined disks , in addition to its straightforward application to stellar photospheres ( heyrovsk , loeb , & sasselov 1996 ) .",
    "microlensing is also a valuable tool for studying sources with organized internal motions , such as rotating disks .",
    "if the gas in the disk emits a spectral line , then the variation of the line profile during a microlensing event would contain important information about the trajectory of the lens and the inclination angle , velocity structure , and brightness profile of the disk . as the lens moves across the disk",
    ", it amplifies the intensity at the doppler shifted wavelength associated with the rotation velocity behind the lens . by examining the time dependence of the line profile it is possible , in principle , to deconvolve the radial brightness profile of the disk down to the innermost radius sampled by the lens trajectory .",
    "examples for relevant sources include the iron k@xmath13 fluorescence line in agn ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; fabian et al . 1995 ; iwasawa et al . 1996 ) , the maser lines emitted from compact disks in galactic nuclei ( e.g. , miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the line emission from stellar accretion disks ( warner 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "a related effect has previously been discussed in the context of the broad emission lines in agn ( nemiroff 1988 ; wambsganss 1990 ; schneider & wambsganss 1990 ) , although these lines are not believed to originate from a cold keplerian disk because they do not posses a double  peaked profile .    in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to microlensing by an isolated point mass lens , and avoid more complex lensing environments ( see , e.g. jaroszyski , wambsganss , & paczyski 1992 ; wambsganss & kundic 1995 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 we derive our main mathematical results for the amplification of an elliptical source . in  3 ,",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the entire lightcurve of a low mass ( e.g. planetary ) lensing event (  3.1 ) and for the wings of the lightcurve in general (  3.2 ) .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are dedicated to specific astrophysical sources . in ",
    "4 we calculate sample lightcurves for a giant star with a realistic limb  darkened profile and for an inclined accretion disk . in  5",
    "we describe the time dependence of emission line profiles from a keplerian disk during a microlensing event . finally , ",
    "6 summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "in analysing the lensing geometry we use the two  dimensional sky coordinates . in this coordinate system , all projected distances are angular .    we consider a general elliptical source with eccentricity @xmath14 and semimajor axis @xmath15 , which we set as our distance unit .",
    "the location of the lens at a given time can be defined by its displacement from the source center @xmath16 and by the angle @xmath17 between the source  lens vector and the major axis of the source .",
    "figure 1 depicts the geometry associated with our notations .",
    "a lens with an einstein radius @xmath18 amplifies the flux from a point source at a distance @xmath19 by a factor @xmath20 in the limit of geometric optics , an extended source can be viewed as a sum of infinitesimal point  like sources .",
    "its amplified flux can therefore be obtained by weighting @xmath21 with the surface brightness distribution @xmath22 and integrating over the projected surface area of the source @xmath23 , @xmath24 the net amplification is the ratio between this flux and the flux of the source in the absence of the lens , @xmath25 where @xmath26    it is most convenient to describe the surface brightness distribution of the source in terms of a coordinate system which is centered on the source .",
    "we set the @xmath27axis along the major axis of the ellipse ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and adopt the following coordinates : @xmath28 .",
    "curves of constant @xmath29 are nested ellipses with semimajor axes @xmath29 and equal eccentricity @xmath14 ; @xmath30 corresponds to the limb of the source .",
    "note that @xmath31 , which runs from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , is _ not _ the polar angle in the case of nonzero eccentricity .",
    "the area element is @xmath34 , and so equation  ( [ eq : fzero ] ) becomes @xmath35    in calculating the lensed flux in equation  ( [ eq : lensedflux ] ) , it is advantageous to use lens  centered polar coordinates for which the amplification factor preserves its simple form  ( [ eq:1 ] ) . if we erect the corresponding @xmath36 axis from the lens towards the source center , we obtain the coordinates : @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . to express the source boundary and brightness distribution in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath38 , we need to transform the source  centered coordinates to the lens  centered coordinates .",
    "as seen from figure 1 , @xmath39 or equivalently , @xmath40 from these equations it is straightforward to express both @xmath29 and @xmath31 in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath29 we get @xmath41 with @xmath42    \\label{eq:8}\\\\ \\sigma_0&=&\\tau_0\\sqrt{1+\\frac{e^2}{1-e^2}\\sin^2\\alpha_0 } \\nonumber\\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath43 is the value of @xmath29 at the position of the lens ( @xmath44 ) . if the lens lies within the source boundary then @xmath45 , and if it lies beyond the boundary , @xmath46 . for a given angle @xmath38 ,",
    "the integration limits in the @xmath19 direction are found by setting @xmath47 in equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) , @xmath48 a line originating from the lens at an angle @xmath38 enters the source boundary at @xmath49 ( provided @xmath46 ) and exits at @xmath50 . if @xmath45 , @xmath38 runs from @xmath51 to @xmath52 . to determine the @xmath38 integration limits in the @xmath46 case",
    ", we set @xmath53 in equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "after some algebra we find , @xmath54 this expression generally yields four different solutions for @xmath55 , due to the implicit @xmath56 ambiguity in this angle .",
    "the two values of interest are directed towards the source , and for them @xmath57 .",
    "we use @xmath58 as the lower limit , and @xmath59 as the upper limit .",
    "since the area element in the lens  centered coordinates is @xmath60 , the divergence of the integrand in equation  ( [ eq : lensedflux ] ) at @xmath44 is eliminated .",
    "the explicit form of equation  ( [ eq : lensedflux ] ) as a function of the lens position is : @xmath61 and @xmath62    so far we made no assumptions about the brightness distribution @xmath63 . in the following we concentrate on elliptical source profiles with @xmath64 being independent of @xmath31 . in particular , if the brightness can be written as a series in powers of @xmath65 @xmath66 then equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) can be used to transform this series to a polynomial in @xmath19 , @xmath67 here the constants @xmath68 are the @xmath69th derivatives of the brightness profile  ( [ eq : bexpansion ] ) with respect to @xmath65 at the position of the lens , @xmath70_{\\rho=\\sigma_0 } = \\sum_{i = n}^{k}\\frac{i!}{(i - n)!}\\beta_i\\sigma_0^{2(i - n)}\\quad .\\ ] ] note that in this expression the derivatives of the polynomial  ( [ eq : bexpansion ] ) are formally evaluated at the lens position even if it lies beyond the source boundary .",
    "surface brightness profiles of astrophysical sources are often defined through a set of discrete points @xmath81,\\ ; i=1,\\ldots , n$ ] , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "a straightforward application of the above results could be obtained through a least ",
    "squares fit of the form  ( [ eq : bexpansion ] ) to the data points .",
    "however , a satisfactory global fit for @xmath84 often requires the use of many high  order terms in the series . for the @xmath85 terms of equation  ( [ eq : bexpansion ] )",
    "it is necessary to evaluate @xmath86 functions @xmath87 , with increasing complexity at increasing @xmath88 . as a result ,",
    "an appropriate numerical integration scheme ( such as gaussian quadrature ) would be more effective for high @xmath88 .",
    "an alternative possibility is to interpolate between pairs of neighboring data points , so that for @xmath89 the brightness is described by an adequate function @xmath90 .",
    "a simple example for an interpolation scheme involves @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are determined by the continuity conditions at the boundary points , @xmath94 this interpolation scheme for the brightness profile does not have a continuous derivative at the data points @xmath95 .",
    "smoothness can be easily achieved by adding a @xmath96 term to equation  ( [ eq : interpolation ] ) and by adding conditions for the continuity of the derivative in equation  ( [ eq : continuity ] ) .    following the interpolation scheme of equation  ( [ eq : interpolation ] ) ,",
    "the source is divided into @xmath97 concentric bands , bounded by ellipses with semimajor axes @xmath95 .",
    "the brightness profile inside the @xmath98th band is described by values @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "a line of constant angle @xmath38 from the lens passes through a sequence of @xmath101 bands in the @xmath19direction , and crosses their boundaries at values @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "we correspondingly substitute in the integrand of equation  ( [ eq:20 ] ) @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the index of the band crossed between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "an analogous substitution with @xmath108 should be performed in the integrand of equation  ( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "the sequence of bands that are crossed can easily be determined from the geometry illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "if the lens lies outside the source boundary ( @xmath46 ) , one needs to find the innermost band which is crossed .",
    "the @xmath29interval of this band contains the minimum value of @xmath29 which is reached along the @xmath109   ray .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) yields @xmath110 if the lens lies inside the source boundary ( @xmath45 ) , the sequence of bands starts at the lens position ( @xmath111 ) , and the band with @xmath112 has to be determined only if @xmath113 . to calculate the crossing points @xmath106 ,",
    "it is then sufficient to know that intersections with ellipse @xmath114 occur at @xmath115 if the necessary number of bands is high , numerical evaluation of the @xmath19 integral should be considered as an alternative .",
    "the method has so far been presented for an elliptical source .",
    "most of the equations are considerably simpler for a circular source . by setting the eccentricity to zero , @xmath116 , the source  centered coordinates @xmath117 become regular polar coordinates , with @xmath15 being the source radius .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:8 ] ) reduce to : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath19 integration limits in equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) are @xmath121 and the angular integration limits in equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) are given by @xmath122 due to the circular symmetry , the angular integration in equations  ( [ eq:20 ] ) and  ( [ eq:21 ] ) can be performed over half the interval and the result multiplied by a factor of two .    in principle",
    ", our method can also be used to describe the effect of spots on lightcurves of extended sources ( sasselov 1996 ) . since the observed flux is linearly dependent on the source brightness",
    ", one could simply superimpose the lightcurve of an elliptical spot on top of the background lightcurve .",
    "the results obtained for brightness profile  ( [ eq : bexpansion ] ) can be used to study the limiting case when the einstein radius of the lens is much smaller than the source size ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the lensed flux in equations  ( [ eq:20 ] ) and  ( [ eq:21 ] ) depends on @xmath18 only through the functions @xmath124 in equations  ( [ eq:17])([eq:19 ] ) . for small @xmath18 ,",
    "these functions can be expanded as power series in @xmath18 .",
    "we make use of the expansions @xmath125 if the lens position is inside the source boundary ( @xmath45 ) , we obtain @xmath126 if the lens is outside the source ( @xmath46 ) , we get @xmath127_{\\tau_-}^{\\tau_+ }   + o(\\epsilon^4 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & j_2(\\tau_-,\\tau_+)&=\\left[\\frac{\\tau^4}{2 }   + 4\\epsilon^4\\ln\\tau\\right]_{\\tau_-}^{\\tau_+}+o(\\epsilon^4 )   \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observed flux can now be obtained from equations  ( [ eq:20 ] ) and  ( [ eq:21 ] ) : @xmath128 and @xmath129    since @xmath130 is the brightness at the position of the lens , the lightcurve traces the brightness profile along the lens trajectory to leading order ( @xmath131 ) . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the excess flux equals twice the einstein ring area times @xmath130 .",
    "the accuracy of this leading  order approximation will be demonstrated through a numerical example in  4 .",
    "we expect the first two terms in equations  ( [ eq:35 ] ) and  ( [ eq:36 ] ) to hold in general for an arbitrary surface brightness distribution , as long as the variations in @xmath132 are weak on the scale of the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "note that the convergence of the above expansions requires that @xmath133 be smaller than @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "hence , the derived expression for the lightcurve is valid as long as the lens lies a distance greater than @xmath133 away from the source boundary .",
    "we next study the effect that a finite source size has on the wings of a general lightcurve . for this purpose",
    "we start from equation  ( [ eq : lensedflux ] ) and place no restrictions on the brightness distribution @xmath22 .",
    "we associate the `` wings '' of the lightcurve with the region over which the lens  source separation is larger than both the einstein diameter of the lens and the size of the source , i.e. we assume that @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "rewriting equation  ( [ eq : lensedflux ] ) in terms of source coordinates , we get @xmath138 where @xmath139 can be expressed from equations  ( [ eq:6 ] ) , @xmath140 the amplification factor in the integrand of equation  ( [ eq:37 ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath141 , @xmath142 by substituting this result into equation  ( [ eq:37 ] ) we obtain , @xmath143    the leading correction to the unlensed flux ( of order @xmath144 ) is independent of the source structure , and appears also for a point source .",
    "the next term ( of order @xmath145 ) vanishes for a point source , as well as for any symmetric source with @xmath146 .",
    "the integral in this term is , in fact , the projection of the `` brightness dipole moment '' @xmath147 on the source  lens direction .",
    "this term therefore reflects the asymmetry in the brightness distribution of the source , which could result from the existence of hot or cold spots on its surface ( sasselov 1996 ; gould & miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the term vanishes if we redefine the positions relative to the center of brightness , rather than the geometrical center of the source .",
    "the microlensing lightcurve of the source is obtained from the time dependence of the lens position coordinates , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "a linear motion of the lens with respect to the source can be described by two parameters : the angle @xmath150 between the major axis of the source and the lens trajectory , and the impact parameter @xmath151 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . to avoid ambiguity , we assign a negative sign to @xmath151 if the source center lies to the right of the lens trajectory . for convenience ,",
    "we normalize the time @xmath152 in units of semimajor axis crossing  time and set @xmath153 at closest approach .",

    "the source , a red giant in the galactic bulge , was amplified by a lens with an einstein radius @xmath155 and an impact parameter @xmath156 .",
    "the r  band brightness profile shown in figure 4 is based on an atmosphere model calculation of the source by sasselov ( 1996 ) .",

    "while the lightcurves of a circularly symmetric source are invariant to @xmath150 , the inclination of the disk leaves a distinct @xmath150dependent signature on the amplitude and symmetry of its lightcurve .",
    "next we consider the effect of microlensing on the spectral shape of an emission line from an accretion disk . because of the doppler shift associated with the disk rotation , the amplification as a function of wavelength could help unravel the inclination and surface brightness distribution of the disk .    to examine the microlensing distortion of the line profile we adopt the simplest model of a planar thin keplerian disk with an inner radius @xmath167 and inclination @xmath159 .",

    "the curve with @xmath195 illustrates another feature , present when the lens is positioned on top of the disk .",
    "in this situation , the profile diverges at the emission wavelength of the geometric point behind the lens , @xmath196 .",
    "this divergence is integrable , and so a filter with a finite wavelength resolution would register it as a third peak . in reality , the formal divergence will be smoothed out by the thermal width of the line . the time ",
    "dependent intensity profile around the moving third peak can be used to map the axisymmetric brightness profile of the disk as the lens scans the source along its linear trajectory .",
    "the asymmetry of the microlensed line profiles in figure 9 indicates a change in the mean redshift of the emitted line , depending on the lens position .",
    "this effect has been previously studied for various models of the broad line regions of quasars ( nemiroff 1988 ; schneider & wambsganss 1990 ) .",
    "the redshift change @xmath197 can be simply computed from the spectral intensity @xmath198 in equation  ( [ eq:43 ] ) as @xmath199 figure 10 shows the change in redshift as a function of lens position along the major axis of the disk , for the same situation as in figure 9 . in this case",
    "the redshift can change by more then 10% of the maximum doppler shift from the inner edge of the disk , if the lens is positioned close to the inner edge .",
    "we have developed an efficient method for computing microlensing lightcurves of sources with an elliptical symmetry and a general surface brightness distribution .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:17])([eq:23 ] ) express the amplification of elliptical sources in terms of a one  dimensional integral .",
    "this integral is considerably simpler for a circular source .",
    "the method is well suited for the study of spectral changes due to microlensing .",
    "such changes have already been observed in the macho 9530 event ( alcock et al .",
    "we are currently using the technique for modelling these observations ( sasselov , heyrovsk & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "the method can also be easily extended to describe the effect of elliptical spots on the background lightcurve.we have derived fully analytical results in the limit of low lens masses [ cf .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:35 ] ) , ( [ eq:36 ] ) ] and for the wings of the lightcurve in general [ equation  ( [ eq:40 ] ) ] . in both cases , the lightcurve carries information about deviations of the source from elliptical symmetry ( e.g. , due to hot or cold spots ) .",
    "the low mass limit case applies to lensing of giant stars in the milky way bulge by planets of mass @xmath200 , for which the einstein radius is @xmath201 .",
    "the lightcurve in this case obtains the form of a low amplitude increase in the source intensity over the source crossing time .",
    "the amplitude of the excess flux is twice the area of the einstein ring times the brightness of the source at the lens position [ cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:35 ] ) ] .",
    "events of this type might soon be discovered through ongoing microlensing searches for planets ( albrow et al .",
    "1996 ; pratt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "finite source signatures appear whenever the impact parameter is comparable to the source size , including high amplification events caused by massive lenses .",
    "figure 5 shows the theoretical lightcurve corresponding to the source and lens parameters of a microlensing event of this type , macho 9530 ( pratt 1996 , alcock et al .",
    "the detection rate of events with finite source signatures is expected to increase if future searches will focus on the source population of giant stars ( gould 1995a ) .",
    "when such signatures are combined with spectroscopic identification of the sources , they can be used to break the degeneracy of microlensing lightcurves ( loeb & sasselov 1995 ; gould & welch 1996 ) .",
    "our formalism is particularly suitable for the analysis of microlensing of inclined accretion disks which appear elliptical in projection on the sky .",
    "the microlensing lightcurve of the disk depends on its surface brightness distribution and inclination ( cf .",
    "fig . 7 ) .",
    "if a thin disk emits a spectral line , then it is possible to deconvolve its properties from the variation of the line profile during a microlensing event .",
    "when the lens position overlaps with the disk , a third peak is added to the standard `` double  peak '' profile of the disk emission .",
    "the microlensing peak appears at the emission wavelength corresponding to the doppler velocity behind the lens ( cf .",
    "9 ) . as the lens moves along a straight line",
    ", the temporal evolution of the intensity and wavelength of the third peak can be used to map the disk structure .",
    "thus , microlensing of a spectral line offers a unique opportunity for unraveling the surface brightness and velocity profiles of accretion disks .",
    "the main practical obstacle for such mappings is the potential for intrinsic variability in the disk properties during the event .",
    "figure 10 illustrates the change in the mean redshift of the spectral line , due to the asymmetry of the microlensed profiles .",
    "the change can exceed 10% of the maximum doppler shift in the disk .",
    "the signatures described in this paper should be more complicated in environments where the microlensing optical depth is not small , such as the cores of galactic _ macro_-lenses at cosmological distances .",
    "however , our _ isolated point lens _ calculation still applies to the outer halos of such galaxies , where the optical depth is low .",
    "quasar absorption spectra can be used to select such foreground galactic halos . in particular , damped ly@xmath13 or metal  line absorption features are often associated with projected impact parameters of @xmath202@xmath203 kpc from galactic centers ( steidel et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) , and could therefore be used to signal an intervening galactic halo .",
    "if galactic halos are composed of massive compact halo objects , then a significant fraction of all damped ly@xmath13 absorbers should show evidence for isolated microlensing events ( perna & loeb 1997 ) , of the type discussed in this work .",
    "isolated microlensing events from intergalactic stars are also possible but only for a minority of all quasars ( dalcanton et al .",
    "1994 ; gould 1995b ) .",
    "we thank dimitar sasselov for providing the brightness profile of the macho 9530 source , and robert nemiroff for suggesting the calculation of the change in the mean redshift of microlensed emission lines .",
    "we also thank both for valuable comments on the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nasa atp grant nag5 - 3085 and the harvard milton fund ( for al ) .",
