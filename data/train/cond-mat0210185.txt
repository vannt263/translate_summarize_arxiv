    "the search for the superfluid phase transition in a trapped gas of fermi atoms is one of the most exciting problems in current physics.@xcite this involves the formation of bcs cooper - pairs made up of degenerate fermions of two different species (  spin up \" and  spin down \" ) .",
    "degenerate fermi gases have been realized in @xmath4k@xcite and @xmath5li.@xcite very recently , a feshbach resonance was observed in @xmath4k working with the two hyperfine states @xmath6 and @xmath7.@xcite in the feshbach resonance , a quasi - molecular boson is formed , which can produce an attractive pairing interaction between two fermi atoms of opposite spins.@xcite as a result , one expects a bcs - type superfluidity with a high phase transition temperature @xmath1 due to this strong attractive interaction.@xcite however , such strong interaction is also known to enhance fluctuations , which can strongly suppress @xmath1 predicted by the usual mean - field bcs theory .",
    "thus the inclusion of these cooper - pair channel fluctuations is crucial in considering the high-@xmath1 superfluidity induced by an atomic feshbach resonance .    in a previous paper,@xcite",
    "we have discussed how this fluctuation contribution affects the superfluid phase transition temperature in a uniform fermi gas , extending the theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink:@xcite we assume that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of fermi atoms with spin-@xmath10 , and that both fermion components have the same single - particle energy . as the threshold energy of the feshbach resonance",
    "is lowered , the character of the phase transition is found to continuously change from the bcs - type to bec - type . in the latter regime , @xmath1 is strongly suppressed compared with the usual mean - field bcs theory and it approaches @xmath11 in the bec limit .",
    "( here @xmath12 is the fermi temperature of the non - interacting spin - up fermi gas . )",
    "we show that the stable bosons which appear as we enter the bec regime are a strongly hybridized mixture of feshbach molecules and preformed cooper - pairs",
    ". the feshbach component of these bosons dominates the excitation spectrum in the bec limit .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous work@xcite by including the effect of a harmonic trap potential .",
    "this extension is clearly necessary since all experiments on fermi gases are done in some sort of trap potential .",
    "so far , the trapping potential has been examined within the mean - field bcs theory using the simple local density approximation ( lda).@xcite in this paper , we also use the lda but go past the mean - field approximation to include the effect of particle - particle fluctuations .",
    "we show how the bcs - bec crossover can be observed from characteristic changes in the static atomic density profile , easily measured by standard techniques .    besides the phase transition temperature @xmath1 , it is also important to understand how strong - coupling fluctuation effects enter above @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is an interesting problem to clarify at what temperature the stable feshbach molecules and preformed cooper - pairs in the bec regime first appear in the normal - fluid phase above @xmath1 .",
    "our calculations show that above @xmath1 , there exists a characteristic temperature @xmath13 which describes the crossover from a free fermi gas to a molecular bose gas .    in this paper",
    ", our treatment of the particle - particle fluctuations assumes that their coupling to the feshbach resonance is weak and can be thus treated perturbatively .",
    "most of our discussion is for this case , in which the bcs - bec crossover is driven by decreasing the value of the feshbach resonance threshold ( @xmath0 ) relative to twice the bare fermi energy ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "when the feshbach coupling strength is very large , as kokkelmans and coworkers have found,@xcite it is not clear that our simple treatment of the particle - particle fluctuations is valid .",
    "however , in this limit , one finds that the bcs - bec crossover occurs for values @xmath15 because of the broad feshbach resonance ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "effectively , one is in the strong - coupling regime discussed by nozires and schmitt - rink,@xcite where the bec phase is associated with preformed cooper - pairs .",

    "7(b ) the density profile above @xmath1 when the temperature is fixed as @xmath318 . in this case , the density profile becomes more spatially diffuse as @xmath198 is increased .",
    "this is because of the increasing dominance of the fermions and the resulting enhancement of the effect of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it is useful to clarify when and how the stable bosons ( @xmath243 and @xmath256 ) at @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) disappear as the temperature is increased above @xmath1 .",
    "figure 8(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the number of particles above @xmath1 ( for @xmath319 ) .",
    "the number of stable bosons ( @xmath243 and @xmath256 ) , as well as the finite lifetime bosons ( @xmath244 ) and the scattering contribution ( @xmath259 ) , are found to all decrease at higher temperatures .",
    "this result is also obtained when @xmath263 .",
    "thus only the free fermi atoms contribute at higher temperatures well above @xmath1 .",
    "the reason that the fermi atom contribution dominates at high temperatures has a very simple explanation in the difference of the chemical potentials between a fermi atom ( @xmath320 ) and a @xmath24-boson ( @xmath321 ) . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the chemical potential @xmath30 must decrease so as to conserve the total number of atoms [ @xmath125=(fermi atoms)+2@xmath322(bose molecules ) ] , as shown in fig .",
    "thus for @xmath323 , the boson excitation energy @xmath324 always increases faster than the excitation energy of the fermions @xmath325 , simply due to the factor two in front of @xmath30 in the bose excitation energy . as a result",
    ", the occupation of the bose band always approaches zero for @xmath323 , even though the bosons can be the dominant excitation at @xmath1 in the bec regime .",
    "however , fig .",
    "8 still shows that there is a significant region above @xmath1 where the number of long - lived bosons is substantial .",
    "it is thus useful to define a",
    " crossover temperature \" @xmath13 which separates the fermi gas and the bose gas regimes , even though the increase in the number of stable bosons occurs continuously .",
    "we _ define _ @xmath13 as the temperature at which @xmath326 , or when 10@xmath327 of the fermi atoms combine to form stable @xmath24-molecules ( fig .",
    "figure 9 shows that @xmath13 rapidly increases when @xmath198 is small or negative , for which case stable bosons appear at @xmath1 ( @xmath328 , for the parameters used ) .",
    "even for @xmath329 , @xmath330 is considerably larger than @xmath1 . since this ",
    "bose gas regime \" lying between @xmath1 and @xmath13 is fairly wide , one might expect to observe the formation of the stable molecules somewhat above @xmath1 if we can decrease the threshold energy @xmath0 enough , namely to values where the superfluid transition at @xmath1 would be of the bec type ( see fig .",
    "figure 10 compares the temperature dependence of the number of particles and the chemical potential ( lines in the figure ) for @xmath331 with the case of a free ( @xmath332 ) fermion - boson mixture ( filled circles and squares ) . in the non - interacting fermion - boson mixture",
    ", we only impose the constraint that the total number of atoms is conserved [ @xmath125=(fermi atoms)+2@xmath322(bose molecules ) ] .",
    "figure 10 shows that deep in the bec regime ( @xmath331 ) , this constraint alone determines the temperature dependence of the number of particles and the chemical potential . as far as these quantities are concerned , the effect of including the interaction @xmath23 and @xmath26 is clearly negligible .",
    "in all of the numerical results presented so far , we have considered the case of a weak feshbach coupling described by @xmath191 . in this regard , recent calculations have argued that strong coupling ( @xmath192 ) was a more realistic description of feshbach resonances observed in ultracold gases.@xcite in this section , we investigate what arises in this strong feshbach coupling regime , although the present treatment of fluctuations implicitly assumes a weak feshbach coupling .",
    "we present some numerical results for @xmath1 in the limit of a large feshbach coupling ( broad resonance ) for a uniform gas . in this regard",
    ", we note that our analysis in the present paper and in ref.@xcite has shown that the bcs - bec crossover in a trap is very similar to that in a uniform gas , at least for the case of weak feshbach coupling .",
    "figure 11 show the bcs - bec crossover in the case of @xmath333 .",
    "figures 11(a ) and 11(b ) show that the crossover behavior already occurs around @xmath334 , which is much higher than @xmath78 .",
    "results similar to this are presented in ref.@xcite . since the bottom of the bose excitation spectrum @xmath0 is then still much higher than the fermion band , the feshbach related @xmath24-bosons described by @xmath335 are almost absent in this crossover regime , as shown in fig .",
    "the high - energy @xmath24-bosons only contribute to virtual scattering processes involving fermions , which mediate the pairing interaction between fermi atoms .",
    "thus , when the feshbach coupling @xmath23 is very strong , the character of the bcs - bec crossover becomes identical to that in the case of strong - coupling superconductivity as discussed by nozires and schmitt - rink.@xcite the fact that the crossover to the bec region occurs at such large values of @xmath0 is easy to understand . since the chemical potential @xmath30 is always of order of @xmath78 or less , at large values of @xmath0 and @xmath23 , we have @xmath336 .",
    "since the strong - coupling effect should be most pronounced when @xmath73 becomes comparable to @xmath78 , the bcs - bec crossover will occur at @xmath337 , which gives @xmath338 . for @xmath339",
    ", this predicts that the crossover will occur at @xmath340 , consistent with the numerical results in fig .",
    "11(a ) .    that the case of a very broad feshbach resonance ( @xmath192 ) is equivalent to the case studied in ref.@xcite is also shown clearly by the fact that stable preformed cooper - pairs are the dominant excitation [ see fig .",
    "11(c ) ] in the crossover region at @xmath341 .",
    "the feshbach @xmath24-molecule component only becomes dominant when @xmath199 .",
    "this result is in contrast to our results for a weak feshbach coupling @xmath191 as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in that case , the @xmath24-molecule becomes the dominant component at the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "figure 12 shows the total number of composite bosons @xmath342 as a function of @xmath198 , for @xmath339 . although the individual cooper - pair components @xmath256 and @xmath259 show [ see fig .",
    "11(c ) ] singular behavior in the bcs - bec crossover regime ( at @xmath341 ) , @xmath265 itself increases smoothly as the threshold energy is decreased .    since the bcs - bec crossover around @xmath334 shown in fig .",
    "11 is intrinsically the same phenomenon as discussed by nozires and schmitt - rink,@xcite the origin of the small peak in @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "11(a ) is the analogue of the one formed also in the case of strong - coupling superconductivity.@xcite however , haussmann@xcite showed that the slight peak in @xmath1 obtained at the bcs - bec crossover in strong - coupling superconductivity disappears when one includes higher order scattering processes beyond the simple @xmath43-matrix approximation , such as used in the present paper .",
    "thus , we regard the small peak @xmath1 in fig .",
    "11(a ) as probably an artifact of our simple @xmath43-matrix approximation . as in the weak feshbach coupling case shown in fig .",

    "to summarize , we have extended our recent work@xcite and investigated the effect of particle - particle fluctuations in conjunction with an atomic feshbach resonance on the superfluid phase transition in a gas of fermi atoms in a harmonic trap , using a simple lda approach .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover predicts a maximum transition temperature of @xmath343 , somewhat larger than @xmath11 in a uniform gas.@xcite in the bec regime , the excitation spectrum is dominated by the stable long - lived feshbach - related molecules in the case of a small feshbach coupling parameter @xmath23 .",
    "this is in contrast with results for the bcs - bec crossover with no feshbach resonance,@xcite where the preformed cooper - pairs are the dominant bound states . for a very broad feshbach resonance ( @xmath192 )",
    "as studied in refs.@xcite , we find that the crossover region is also dominated by preformed cooper - pairs .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is shown to strongly affect the atomic density profile in the trap , which can be measured . in the bcs regime , where fermi atoms are dominant excitations , the spatial distribution of the atoms is spread out from the trap center due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the atoms increasingly cluster at the center of the trap as the threshold energy of @xmath24-bose excitation spectrum is lowered and the the number of stable composite bosons increases .    in the bec regime",
    ", we show that stable molecules can exist above @xmath1 .",
    "as the temperature increases , however , the number of these bosons decreases .",
    "we introduce a crossover temperature @xmath13 defined as the temperature above @xmath1 at which 10@xmath327 of the fermi atoms have formed long - lived @xmath24-molecules . plotting @xmath13 as a function of the threshold @xmath0 gives a sort of  phase diagram \" in the normal phase which may be useful in experimental searches for the bcs - bec crossover",
    ".    the experimental observation of cooper - pairs in trapped fermi gases will be a very exciting milestone in physics .",
    "what makes this topic even more interesting is the possibility that we can observe the bcs - bec crossover in such systems .",
