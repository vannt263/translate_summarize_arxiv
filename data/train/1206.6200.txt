    "cobalt alloys , such as copt or copd , are ubiquitous in the field of magnetic recording and of particular interest to the field of ultrafast magneto - optics @xcite . in terms of magnetic recording , increasing areal densities require decreased grain size , which in turn requires increasing values of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) to ensure thermal stability of written information @xcite .",
    "currently this is achieved using copt alloys with perpendicular anisotropy .",
    "consequently an understanding of the origin of the mae in copt is an important practical problem .",
    "since the magnetic properties of these alloys are highly sensitive to the amount and the spatial distribution of the pt content , understanding the effects of alloying is an important issue .",
    "the effects on the magnetic properties of copt as functions of the platinum content have been studied extensively , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally @xcite . moreover , in recent experimental work  @xcite it was demonstrated that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) of cobalt can be tuned by letting platinum impurities migrate into the cobalt system .",
    "generally it is agreed that the addition of platinum to a magnetic material , such as fe or co , influences the magnetic properties , in particular , the mae of the material primarily through the strong spin - orbit coupling of pt @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of the present work is to elucidate from first principles the effect on the mae of bulk hcp co by the addition of platinum . to this end , we use the fully relativistic screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( skkr ) method as combined with the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) , which is well suited to describing substitutional alloys @xcite .",
    "our model focuses on pt alloying in a ( 0001 ) atomic plane of a hcp co bulk system , from the case of an impurity to the case of a complete filling of the layer by pt .",
    "after briefly discussing the computational methods we present the calculated mae as a function of the pt concentration and analyze the results in terms of layer- and species - resolved contributions to the mae .",
    "we note that recording media are complex alloy systems , often containing cr to promote grain boundary separation .",
    "it is often found that the maximum mae as a function of pt concentration is limited by , for example , the formation of new phases @xcite or the presence of stacking faults @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned only with the intrinsic enhancement of the mae introduced by the pt impurities .",
    "remarkably , this analysis highlights the role of long - ranged friedel oscillations in forming the mae of the system . specifically , we demonstrate a layer dependence of the valence charge which makes the effect of the pt impurities long - ranged",
    ". this might have significant impact on the determination of the mae of thin film samples corresponding to the systems studied in this work .",
    "in particular it might be expected to give rise to finite size effects in the mae of granular thin films for magnetic recording which would become more significant as the grain size is reduced .",
    "the central feature of the skkr method is the evaluation of the electronic green s function of a layered system . here , a layered system refers to a system exhibiting two - dimensional translational symmetry in each ( infinite ) atomic plane , but in which there are no symmetry requirements along the third axis . from the green s function",
    "one can then determine a number of physical quantities of interest , such as site - projected charges , spin- and orbital moments and the total energy of the system . as the method is well documented elsewhere @xcite , here we present only some details of our calculations .",
    "the calculations were performed within the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) of density - functional theory ( dft ) as parametrised by vosko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the effective potentials and fields were treated in the framework of the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) .",
    "the substitutional pt alloying was treated within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite . as the lsda fails in predicting the orbital moment and the mae for hcp co",
    "correctly , we employed a heuristic extension of the relativistic electron theory by the orbital polarisation ( op ) correction @xcite , as implemented within the kkr method by ebert and battocletti @xcite .",
    "the corresponding kohn - sham - dirac equations were solved using a spherical wave expansion up to an angular momentum number of @xmath0 , although it should be noted that the op correction was applied only for the @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "+ the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy was evaluated within the magnetic force theorem @xcite , in which the total energy of the system can be replaced by the single - particle ( band ) energy .",
    "moreover , we employed the torque method @xcite , making use of the fact that , for a uniaxial system , the mae , @xmath2 , can be calculated up to second order in spin - orbit coupling as @xmath3 where , in the case of hcp geometry , @xmath4 denotes the angle of the spin - polarisation with respect to the @xmath5 direction , i.e. , the direction perpendicular to the hexagonal planes .",
    "note that the @xmath6-axis of the ( global ) frame of reference in our calculations is defined to be parallel to the @xmath5 direction . within the kkr formalism",
    ", @xmath2 can be decomposed into site- and species - resolved contributions , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the concentration of species @xmath9 at site @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the corresponding derivative of the band energy . using lloyd s formula @xcite ,",
    "@xmath11 can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi energy and , in case species @xmath9 occupies site @xmath10 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for the angular momentum matrices of the single - site @xmath16 operator and the site - diagonal scattering path operator , respectively .",
    "all these quantities are calculated at the direction of the magnetisation @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : torque ] ) .",
    "the derivative of the @xmath16-matrix is evaluated as described in  @xcite . the energy integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dia ] ) can be accurately performed by sampling 20 energy points on an asymmetric mesh along a semi - circle contour in the upper complex semi - plane . in order to achieve an accuracy within 5 % for the mae ,",
    "a sufficiently dense mesh in the two - dimensional brillouin zone ( 2d - bz ) was used to evaluate @xmath15 : at the energy point closest to the fermi energy , we used 5764 @xmath19-points in the irreducible wedge of the 2d - bz , corresponding to more than 34  000 @xmath19-points in the full 2d - bz . due to the two - dimensional translational symmetry of the system",

    "( [ eq : kdecomp ] ) is used to label atomic layers .",
    "+ the skkr method as applied to layered systems requires the system to be divided into a middle region wedged between two semi - infinite bulk regions .",
    "adhering to this requirement , the effect of platinum alloying in a single atomic layer of bulk hcp co was investigated by considering a layered system as shown in fig .",
    "[ coptsystem ] . each atomic layer in the semi - infinite bulk regions corresponds to pure hcp co bulk . since the middle region needs to contain an integer number of unit cells and since each unit cell spans two atomic layers , this region consists of @xmath20 hexagonal co layers stacked along the @xmath5 direction . in one of the two central layers of the middle region , namely , in the one indexed by 0 in fig .",
    "[ coptsystem ] , a fraction @xmath21 of the co atoms are replaced by pt atoms . from here on , this layer will be referred to as the _ impurity layer_. it should also be mentioned that in this work no attempts are made to trace any structural relaxation effects of the hcp co lattice caused by pt impurities . + to take into account relaxation of the effective potentials and fields , we performed self - consistent calculations with @xmath22 , i.e.  for 28 layers in total .",
    "one important consequence of the geometrical construction shown in fig .",
    "[ coptsystem ] is that the calculation of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kdecomp ] ) is confined to layers within the middle region , i.e. , for @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the long - ranged friedel oscillations that arise due to the presence of pt impurities are necessarily truncated .",
    "in order to safeguard against any numerical artefacts caused by this truncation , we increased the number of atomic layers in the middle region until the layer - resolved mae converged to within about 1 % accuracy to the bulk co mae at the outer edges of the middle region .",
    "according to our calculations ( see below ) , this condition requires @xmath24 , i.e. , 80 atomic layers in total .",
    "we performed these calculations of the mae by appending the perfect bulk potential of hcp co to the layers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. , neglecting self - consistency effects for these atomic layers . to check the accuracy of this approach , we compared @xmath27 for atomic layer no .",
    "14 ( with relaxed self - consistent potential ) with that for atomic layer no .",
    "@xmath28 ( with appended co bulk potential ) and obtained that the two values agree to within @xmath29 % .",

    "note that the @xmath6-axis is defined to be parallel to the @xmath5 direction of the hcp crystal .",
    "[ coptsystem ] ]",
    "to test our computational method , we first determined the mae of bulk hcp co. excluding the op correction we obtained an easy - plane magnetisation and a mae of 6.7 @xmath32ev / co  atom , while including the op correction we instead obtained an easy axis perpendicular to the hexagonal co planes and a mae of 84.4 @xmath32ev / co .",
    "the latter result is in good agreement with the experimental value of 65.5 @xmath32ev @xcite and with the experimental easy axis being along the ( 0001 ) direction .",
    "our result also compares well with that of trygg _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who calculated @xmath33  @xmath32ev for hcp co using a full - potential lmto method including op correction . + as described in section 2 , we performed calculations of the mae of a bulk co system in which a single layer has been substitutionally alloyed by pt in a fraction of @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : kdecomp ] ) and ( [ eq : dia ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ layermaefig ] for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "remarkably , even such small amounts of pt induce large fluctuations in @xmath35 : in the impurity layer ( @xmath38 ) and in the co layers near the impurity layer ( @xmath39 ) the relative changes of @xmath35 with respect to the bulk co mae reach 10  % .",
    "in particular , the co contribution from layers @xmath401 is enhanced to nearly 94 @xmath32ev , while that those from layers @xmath402 are reduced to nearly 76 @xmath32ev for @xmath37 . for layers further away from the impurity layer ( @xmath41 ) , oscillations in @xmath35 with rapidly decreasing amplitude can be seen .",
    "reassuringly , the layer - resolved co contributions approach the bulk co mae towards the outer edges of the middle region chosen in our calculations ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "the mirror symmetry around the impurity layer , @xmath44 , is also fulfilled with a high accuracy .",

    "solid lines connecting the symbols serve as guides for the eye .",
    "[ layermaefig ] ]    our earlier studies of the mae of impurities  @xcite , justified that the mae is extremely sensitive to the presence of friedel oscillations in the charge density .",
    "it is , therefore , tempting to relate fig .",
    "[ layermaefig ] to the change in the valence charge on the co atoms with respect to the distance from the impurity layer . from fig .",
    "[ charge_and_madelung_layers](a ) we can see that the co atoms in the impurity layer and , in particular , the co atoms in layers adjacent the impurity layer gain some extra charge , while the charge transfer to more distant co layers drops rapidly .",
    "the energy shift of the layer - resolved co valence band position is well described by the layer - resolved change in the madelung potential .",

    "[ layermaefig ] , this shift of the valence states correlates directly with the mae contributions of the co layers adjacent the impurity layer , but , clearly enough , the changes in the mae contributions from more distant co layers are also subject to fine details of the valence states influenced by the pt alloying . +    the effect on the species - resolved mae by alloying with pt is demonstrated for the whole range of @xmath21 in fig",

    "@xmath49 is again reduced with increasing @xmath21 and at @xmath53 @xmath49 even becomes negative .",
    "note that @xmath49 for @xmath54 ( not calculated here ) would correspond to the contribution of a single co atom in a pure pt layer which , in general , would differ from zero .",
    "the on - site platinum contribution , @xmath48 , approaches the very small value of 0.01  mev as @xmath55 , rapidly increases up to 0.30 mev at @xmath56 and then saturates at @xmath57  mev for larger @xmath21 .",
    "+ it can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ comparison4](b ) , that pt alloying most dramatically influences the co contribution at the layers adjacent to the impurity layer : @xmath58 increases almost linearly from the bulk mae at @xmath59 to about 0.7  mev at @xmath60 . as already seen in fig .",
    "[ layermaefig ] , the co contributions @xmath35 from layers further out ( @xmath61 ) decrease with increasing @xmath21 and even becomes negative at @xmath62 for @xmath63 and 3 . for @xmath64",
    "these contributions show a modest increase , but @xmath65 still remains negative .",
    "+    it is worth investigating the change of valence states projected onto the co atoms in layer 1 . from fig .",
    "[ charge_and_madelung_layer1](a ) it is obvious that the valence charge at this co atom increases almost linearly with @xmath21 from 9.00 @xmath66 to 9.16 @xmath66 .",

    "charge_and_madelung_layer1](b ) .",
    "the large enhancement of the mae contribution from layer 1 , @xmath58 , can therefore be related directly to the monotonic shift of the corresponding valence states . +    while the species- and layer - resolved contributions to the mae are very illuminating for a microscopic description of the variations in the mae , from an experimental point of view only the mae of the whole system can be accessed . here",

    "<S> in terms of the fully relativistic screened korringa - kohn - rostoker method we investigate the variation in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) of hexagonal close - packed cobalt with the addition of platinum impurities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we perform calculations on a bulk cobalt system in which one of the atomic layers contains a fractional , substitutional platinum impurity . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that at small concentrations of platinum the mae is reduced , while at larger concentrations the mae is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> this change of the mae can be attributed to an interplay between on - site pt mae contributions and induced mae contributions on the co sites . </S>",
    "<S> the latter ones are subject to pronounced , long - ranged friedel - oscillations that can lead to significant size effects in the experimental determination of the mae of nano - sized samples . </S>"
