    "model systems of hard particles constitute the natural choice to describe the phase and aggregation behavior of most colloidal systems , as the main interactions established between their particles have a repulsive , steric origin . as a consequence ,",
    "a hard - particle fluid does not have internal energy and minimizing its free energy is equivalent to maximizing its entropy .    in his seminal work",
    ", onsager showed that mere hard - core repulsions between infinitely thin rigid cylinders are able to determine an entropy - driven phase transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase , and hence the existence of a spontaneous orientational order @xcite .",
    "the evolution of simulation techniques in the past decades allowed to investigate the more realistic case of rods with finite size , showing that by varying the length - to - diameter ratio one- ( smectic ) , two- ( columnar ) and three- ( crystal ) dimensional translational ordered phases can be encountered @xcite .",
    "further more accurate studies showed that for a monodisperse system of both aligned @xcite and freely rotating @xcite hard spherocylinders the columnar phase happens to be metastable with respect to the smectic phase for each value of the length - to - diameter ratio .",
    "the complexity of the phase behavior of linear particles becomes even more pronounced by proceeding from monodisperse systems to mixtures @xcite . in particular , size polydispersity introduces a sensible change in the phase behavior of rod - like particles as their packing is not as effective as that of monodisperse rods .",
    "in fact , it was observed that in a system of hard spherocylinders the formation of smectic layers can be inhibited by introducing a length bidispersity , in such a way that the columnar phase can become thermodynamically stable @xcite .",
    "entropy - driven columnar phase transitions have been observed in monodisperse systems of disc - like particles , such as cut spheres or oblate spherocylinders @xcite .",
    "as far as rod - like particles are concerned , theoretical studies indicated that the columnar order can be observed not only in bidisperse mixtures , but also in more realistic polydisperse systems of parallel cylinders @xcite .",

    "this approach allowed to observe for the first time the mechanism of interlayer diffusion , or permeation , which characterizes the dynamics of the system in the smectic phase @xcite .",
    "in fact , the layered structure of smectic lcs , which determines an effective periodic mean - field potential , influences the motion in the direction perpendicular to the smectic layers with the appearance of jumps of the order of the rod length . as a result of this quasi - quantized diffusion , at intermediate time intervals",
    "one can distinguish between `` slow '' particles , which rattle around the center of a column , and `` fast '' particles , which jump to another column .",
    "this heterogeneous dynamics accounts for deviations from gaussianity in the diffusion , a phenomenon which is also well known in homogeneous complex fluids such as supercooled liquids @xcite and gels @xcite . in the light of these results , a theoretical approach based on dynamic density functional theory using the second virial approximation focused on the role played by the local fluid structure of the system , which competes with the permanent barriers due to the smectic structure , thus increasing even more the analogies with fluids close to a dynamical arrest transition @xcite .",
    "simulations on aligned @xcite and freely rotating @xcite hard spherocylinders confirmed qualitatively both these studies and pointed out the effect of dynamical heterogeneities on the structural relaxation of the system , which deviates from the exponential decay expected for simple fluids . furthermore , in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the heterogeneous dynamics in the smectic phase of hard spherocylinders is tightly related to cooperative motion of particles through the smectic layers .    following this line of research and motivated by a recent experiment on _ fd _ virus @xcite , we investigate in this paper the dynamics of a binary mixture of rod - like particles which exhibits a stable columnar liquid crystal phase .",
    "using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations we are able to study for the first time the dynamical heterogeneities which arise from the columnar structure and their effect on the diffusion and on the long - time structural relaxation of the system .",

    "mc and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of lennard - jones fluids @xcite showed that the particle dynamics at large time scales are the same , but are different at small time scales , as the stochastic motion of particles can not be detected by the deterministic approach of md simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , the simulation details and the physical properties which were measured in order to describe the dynamics of the system .",

    "stroobants studied the phase behavior of bidisperse systems of hard rods and found that the bidispersity can favor and stabilize columnar order over smectic order @xcite .",
    "therefore , to prevent the formation of smectic layers , we investigate a binary mixture of hard spherocylinders with the same diameter @xmath3 ( used as our unit of length ) , but different lengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . in this model ,",
    "the rotational degrees of freedom are frozen out and hence the particles are forced to be aligned along a common nematic director , oriented along the _ z _ axis .",
    "the relative concentration of the two species is set in such a way that the binary mixture is kept at its equivalence point , where the volume fractions of each component are the same .",
    "the phase diagram at fixed @xmath8 displays a region of stability of the columnar phase which increases with @xmath5 and disappears at @xmath9 , where a nematic - smectic transition is observed @xcite .",

    "this columnar phase transforms into a nematic phase , while for higher pressures it freezes into a crystal phase .",
    "we performed standard mc simulations in a rectangular box of volume @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions . to equilibrate the columnar phase",
    ", we performed runs in the isobaric - isothermal ( _ npt _ ) ensemble , where the particle moves were accepted according to the metropolis algorithm @xcite , that is if no particle overlap was detected .",

    "in particular , we equilibrated a nematic phase at @xmath17 ( packing fraction @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the single particle volume ) which is very close to the nematic - columnar transition , and three different columnar phases at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . in all these cases , our starting configuration consisted of a highly packed columnar structure with the rods randomly located along the _ z _ direction , and hexagonally ordered in the _ xy _ plane .",
    "the minimum number of mc cycles needed for an equilibration run was @xmath27 , and was followed by a production run of @xmath28 mc cycles in the canonical ( _ nvt _ ) ensemble to simulate the relaxation dynamics and evaluate all the physical properties of interest . in this case , the box volume was kept fixed to prevent unphysical collective moves which do not mimic the brownian dynamics of the particles properly .",
    "it was proved that in rod suspensions the contribution of hydrodynamics can at first approximation be neglected with respect to steric effects , which result in excluded volume interactions @xcite . under these conditions",
    ", the mc approach offers an important tool to study the dynamics of colloids , since , in spite of its intrinsically non - dynamical nature , it is able to reproduce the brownian diffusion typical of such kind of systems @xcite . to pursue this goal",
    ", one must set a small enough maximum mc displacement , typically of the order of one tenth of the shortest dimension of the particle . the optimal value of the mean particle displacement is strictly linked to the acceptance rate and hence to the cpu time per simulation run .",
    "if the displacement is chosen too small , the system would need longer runs to properly explore the configurational space .",
    "the same effect is expected with too big displacements , as most of the particle moves would cause overlaps and therefore would be rejected .",
    "however , any reasonable and convenient choice of the average step size should not affect the dynamics at long time scales .",
    "we tested that , apart from an overall scaling , this was the case .",
    "the maximum displacement was fixed to give an acceptance rate of roughly 50% per move . furthermore , to take into account the non - spherical shape of the particles , the maximum mc displacement was set in such a way that at short times it reproduces the anisotropic diffusion of a single colloidal rod .",
    "more specifically , this means that the ratio between the maximum mc displacement in the @xmath29 plane @xmath30 and in the @xmath31 direction @xmath32 must be set as    @xmath33    where we denoted with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the short - time self - diffusion coefficients of the rod in the direction parallel and perpendicular to its long axis , respectively . to give an estimate for the ratio @xmath36 , which solely depends on the geometry of the particle",

    "the effect of local cage trapping in systems close to dynamical arrest and the presence of permanent long - range inhomogeneities as in liquid crystals manifest themselves in a region at intermediate times where the dynamics is strongly sub - diffusive . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the msd both in the @xmath29 plane and in the @xmath31 direction . in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]a ) one can appreciate the almost linear trend of the msd in the nematic phase , whereas by increasing the pressure and going to the columnar phase a plateau region appears , manifesting the development of a heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "these deviations from linearity are tightly related to the non - gaussian behavior of the self - part of the van hove function , and can be quantitatively estimated by the non - gaussian parameter defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig7bis ] we report the ngp in the @xmath29 plane averaged over the species concentrations as described in eq .",
    "( [ eq7bis ] ) .",
    "this parameter remains close to zero in the nematic phase , while it displays a peak at intermediate times in the columnar phase indicating deviations from gaussianity . on the other hand , along the @xmath31 direction",
    "( not shown here ) the ngp does not deviate significantly from zero .",
    "the choice of calculating the ngp for the whole system by averaging over the value it assumes for the two species separately allows to take into account just the effects related to the long - range structure of the system . for the sake of completeness",
    "we show in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7bis ] a comparison between the ngp at @xmath95 for each species , their weighted average and that corresponding to the whole system . as expected , the operation of average does not affect significantly the position of the peak , but decreases only the peak height , suggesting that in this way the non - gaussianity due to particle size difference is subtracted .",
    "one should notice that this particular treatment is not necessary for the rest of the physical properties measured in this paper , since with the exception of the ngp they result to be linear in the particle species , i.e. their value for the system as a whole corresponds to a weighted average over the species .",
    "the dynamic inhomogeneities as captured by both the msd and the ngp allow to identify three different time intervals . at short times",
    "the msd follows the usual linear trend and the ngp maintains a value close to zero , which means that particles diffuse freely since they do not feel yet the trapping cage due to the surrounding particles . at intermediate times",
    "the msd becomes strongly sub - diffusive and the ngp is characterized by a monotonic growth , thus meaning that the free diffusion is inhibited by the columnar structure of the fluid . at this stage",
    "one can distinguish between particles which still rattle around the position of their column and others which succeeded in overcoming the energetic barrier and jumped to another column .",
    "the end of the subdiffusive plateau and the return to the linear trend of the msd roughly correspond to the peak of the ngp , which starts decreasing monotonically to zero indicating the end of the caging regime , i.e. most of the particles succeeded in leaving their initial column",
    ". a deeper inspection on the pressure dependence of the ngp shows that the degree of non - gaussianity , i.e. the height of the peak , and the duration of the caging regime , i.e. the position of the peak , increase with packing fraction .",
    "this fact can be explained by considering that the cage escape is related to a rearrangement of the surrounding particles , which becomes slower at higher packing fraction as it involves more of them .",
    "furthermore , the small deviations from linearity in the msd in the direction parallel to the nematic director confirm the presence of a weakly heterogeneous dynamics , as already pointed out by analyzing the self - part of the van hove function in this direction .",
    "self - part of the intermediate scattering function @xmath133 and @xmath134 evaluated at wave vectors corresponding to the first peak of the structure factor in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director ( a ) and along it ( b ) .",
    "the data correspond to the same system and statepoints as in fig .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig7bis ] .",
    "the solid lines are fits ( see text ) . ]",
    "finally , the structural relaxation of the system is analyzed in terms of the self - part of the intermediate scattering function ( sisf ) defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) . whereas along the @xmath31 direction the relaxation is characterized by a single step decay at each pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]b ) , a plateau region , which characterizes the relaxation in the @xmath29 plane at intermediate times , develops in the columnar phase .",
    "this plateau , whose value increases with pressure , indicates the time extension of the cage regime and is expected to divide a short - time decay ( @xmath135-relaxation ) from a long - time one ( @xmath136-relaxation ) . as previously observed in recent work on smectic liquid crystals @xcite and in out - of - equilibrium supercooled liquids @xcite , the sisf decays likely to zero at long times , indicating the loss of density auto - correlations .",
    "this kind of behavior was described for the smectic phase in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath136-relaxation decay was fitted by a stretched exponential function of the form @xmath137 $ ] with @xmath138 and @xmath139 the characteristic relaxation time . in the present simulations we did not observe any @xmath136-relaxation as the relaxation time of the systems exceeds probably our simulation time . on the other hand , from the data available a close accordance with the features of the structural relaxation of the smectic phase",
    "can be observed . in particular , the @xmath135-relaxation in the @xmath29 plane is reasonably described by an exponential decay , as expected for simple liquids , due to the lack of interactions of the particles with the nearest neighbors at small times .",
    "also the relaxation along the @xmath31 axis resembles accurately the relaxation of the smectic phase inside the smectic layers .",
    "in fact , in both these cases the sisf depends weakly on the pressure and it is characterized by an exponential decay at small times , which eventually becomes a stretched exponential with @xmath138 . in this sense",
    "we can confirm what the authors observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. the relaxation of a liquid crystal in the direction(s ) in which the system is homogeneous is closer to that of a low - density supercooled liquid , than a simple liquid , where instead an exponential relaxation is to be expected .",
    "in summary , we used monte carlo simulations to analyze for the first time the presence of dynamical heterogeneities in a columnar liquid crystal of perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders .",
    "the long - range hexagonal order in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director determines an effective mean - field potential , whose effect is to maintain particles inside a column preventing them to occupy a position in between the columns . in analogy with previous analyses on the smectic phase , the height of the energetic barriers of this effective potential increases with the packing fraction and the particle anisotropy . as a consequence , in the @xmath29 plane the dynamics of a rod",
    "is characterized by a quasi - quantized behavior in which particles rattle around the position of the column and jump to another column only when the configuration of the surrounding particles allows it .",
    "the rattling - and - jumping dynamics in the in - plane evolution of the system gives rise to three different time regimes . at very short times , the particles diffuse almost freely because they do not feel yet the presence of the trapping cage formed by their surrounding nearest neighbors . at this stage",
    "the behavior of the system is that typical of a simple fluid , characterized by a gaussian distribution of displacements , a linear mean square displacement and a fast exponential structural relaxation .",
    "a second stage starts when particles begin experiencing the cage due to the long - range structure of the system , in such a way that the diffusion results to be inhibited and only occasionally a column - to - column jump takes place and is made possible by the instantaneous configuration of the system . as a result , the mean square displacement as well as the self - intermediate scattering function develop a plateau , which testifies the slowing down of the dynamics and whose time extension increases with packing fraction . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of displacements show marked deviations from gaussianity due to the appearance of peaks which correspond to the lattice positions in the plane .",
    "nonetheless , after longer time intervals the number of `` fast '' particles , which succeeded in overcoming the energetic barrier , increases with respect to the `` slow '' ones .",
    "consequently , when most of the particles succeeded in leaving their initial column , a second diffusive regime starts , indicating the end of the cage regime .",
    "we observed interesting analogies with the dynamics in smectic phases by considering the in - column dynamics .",
    "in fact , along the direction defined by the nematic director , the system does not develop any long - range order , and it is thus expected to behave like a liquid . on the other hand , we noticed interesting , although slight , deviations from gaussian diffusion both in the distribution of displacements and in the mean square displacement .",
    "as far as the structural relaxation is concerned , this fact is testified by a self - intermediate scattering function well approximated by a stretched - exponential , as it happens in dense liquids . in this sense",
    "we confirm previous studies on the smectic phase , that along the direction in which a liquid crystal does not develop any long - range order the dynamics is similar to a dense liquid .",
    "these results are to be compared with recent experiments on the columnar phase of a suspension of _ fd _ virus particles @xcite , where huge discrepancies from gaussianity were observed along the nematic director .",
    "we argue that the higher length - to - diameter ratio , the flexibility or the charge of the rods could account for a more pronounced non - gaussian diffusive behavior than what was observed in the present study .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank m. p. lettinga , e. grelet and e. pouget for sharing preliminary experimental results that motivated this work and d. el masri and p. van der schoot for stimulating discussions .",
