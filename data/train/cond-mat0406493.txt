    "the interplay between electron - electron interactions and quantum interference has been a theme in condensed matter physics for the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "the classic context is interaction effects in disordered systems.@xcite more recently , mesoscopic systems , such as quantum dots  @xcite or metallic nanoparticles @xcite , have been intensively investigated ; both diffusive disordered and ballistic chaotic systems have received attention .",
    "a key quantity in studying such effects is the statistics of the single - particle wave - functions as one moves from level to level , system to system , or in position space .",
    "it is well established that weakly disordered quantum systems , as well as ballistic chaotic ones , display universal statistical behavior@xcite .",
    "universal here means that the properties do not depend on the microscopic details of the disorder , such as its spatial correlation function .",
    "as the behavior is universal , it can be captured by relatively simple models .",
    "in fact , many properties are described well by random matrix theory ( rmt ) ; for those which involve the spatial behavior of wavefunctions , a simple extension of rmt in which eigenstates are described as a superposition of random plane waves ( rpw ) is accurate@xcite . in both computational and experimental results , for instance , the probability distribution of the spacing between adjacent energy levels and the magnitude of the wave function at a single point closely match rmt predictions  @xcite .",
    "complications arise as disorder increases and the wave functions become increasingly non - uniform spatially .",
    "such systems have been investigated extensively , including localized systems @xcite with wave functions confined to a small area of the system .",
    "diffusive systems of intermediate disorder values are of the greatest interest to mesoscopic physics ; complexities due to incipient localization effects have also been studied there  @xcite .    despite this recent interest , several of the eigenfunction statistics most relevant to problems in mesoscopic physics",
    "have never , as far as we know , been studied .",
    "the interaction contribution to the energy , for instance , involves sums over different energy levels of matrix elements of the residual ( screened ) interaction , each of which involves an integration over space . here",
    "we particularly study statistics involving _ both _ different energies and integration over space .",
    "we find that these statistics deviate strongly from expectations , indicating that disordered systems are more complex than previously thought .",
    "we include an analysis of how these results fit with previous experimental and theoretical results , including calculations from the supersymmetric @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "we then apply our statistics to the coulomb blockade problem .",
    "parameters of the study have been chosen for the greatest relevance to the physical conditions of the coulomb blockade in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the issue here is _ not _ the existence of a new regime of behavior but rather _ new characteristics _ in a regime that has been intensively studied for three decades . to make this point",
    ", it is necessary to demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that our calculations are performed in the familiar regime of parameters .",
    "thus , after explaining our methodology in section  [ meth ] , we establish in section  [ rmt ] , for simple eigenfunction statistics , a general agreement with previous results .",
    "the comparison with previous work is by no means exhaustive but rather serves to confirm the diffusive nature of our system and to demonstrate that we get agreement with rmt / rpw expectations for these well - researched statistics .",
    "the core of our paper lies in section  [ normt ] , where we introduce energy correlation statistics that depart markedly from current analytical predictions , thus demonstrating surprising complexities underlying the disordered model , even for parameters that generate agreement with the simple statistics investigated in section  [ rmt ] .",
    "the key numerical results are in figs .",
    "[ fj ] and [ fjpfj ] .",
    "section  [ sec - compare ] contains a detailed comparison between our numerical results and the existing analytic results obtained by the supersymmetric @xmath0-model and rmt / rpw methods .",
    "finally , we explore the importance of these energy correlation statistics in section  [ sec - cb ] , where the new results are directly applied to the coulomb blockade .",
    "all results in this paper were derived within the anderson model , a standard model for describing disordered systems @xcite .",
    "the anderson model employs a discrete lattice geometry , and combines a `` hopping '' hamiltonian with a set of uncorrelated on - site energies : @xmath1 , the transition amplitude , and @xmath2 , the lattice spacing , both equal to 1 .",
    "the @xmath3 s are uncorrelated from site to site , and @xmath4 are drawn from a uniform random distribution of width @xmath5 , which measures the disorder strength of the system . to treat a magnetic field ,",
    "the appropriate phase factor can be added to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our study concentrates on a two - dimensional rectangle of size @xmath7 with hard - wall boundaries .",
    "the large size allows us to choose parameters such that the disorder is weak but the mean free path is less than the system size ; hard wall boundary conditions are more appropriate for realistic quantum dots than other simple possibilities ; and the asymmetry breaks pseudo - degeneracies in the eigenband .",
    "some characteristics of other geometries , such as smaller systems or periodic boundary conditions ( corresponding to a torus ) , are touched on where appropriate .",
    "three main variables can be adjusted to control the physical regime : _ ( i ) _ the mean energy around which to draw statistics , _ ( ii ) _ the disorder strength , and _ ( iii ) _ the strength of any applied magnetic field .    first , each fully diagonalized matrix in this study would produce @xmath8 eigenfunctions .",
    "because of the large size , computing constraints made it reasonable to analyze only eigenfunctions within a narrow band of eigenenergies , here expressed in terms of a `` filling ratio . ''",
    "this ratio indicates the position of the chosen band s central eigenfunction in the full eigenenergy band .",
    "the presented statistics are averaged over both the band s many eigenfunctions and separate disorder realizations .",
    "we analyze energy bands centered at @xmath9 and @xmath10 filling , with band width about @xmath10 .",
    "the very low energy in the second case was chosen to match physical quantum dots , which typically contain only hundreds of electrons . as an added benefit ,",
    "low energies result in a larger wavelength ( @xmath11 and 0.35 , so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) , compensating for the somewhat arbitrary nature of a discrete geometry .",
    "second , the disorder strength of the system , measured as @xmath5 , has a profound effect on the system s behavior .",
    "our results will first demonstrate trends as @xmath5 is varied , and then focus on specific @xmath5 values .",
    "very small @xmath5 produces a semi - ballistic system , whereas very large @xmath5 produces localized eigenfunctions .",
    "we are most interested in intermediate disorder , which yields a diffusive system .",
    "finally , we are also interested in the effect of a small magnetic field , enough to break time reversal invariance but not enough to cause well - defined landau levels , for instance . to add a magnetic field @xmath14 perpendicular to the system plane , we adjust the hopping amplitude in the hamiltonian by using the peirels substitution : @xcite @xmath15 this implies that one changes the hopping terms in the @xmath16 direction according to @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the lattice constant , @xmath18 is the area of the system ( @xmath19 is the number of lattice sites ) , and @xmath20 is the magnetic field in units of magnetic flux quanta through @xmath21 times the area of the system .",
    "we analyze below both the @xmath22 case and a system with sufficient magnetic field to break time - reversal invariance . by analyzing trends as a function of @xmath20",
    ", we determined that @xmath23 is sufficient .",
    "the results in the presence of a magnetic field are applied to the coulomb blockade problem .",
    "before delving into relatively unexplored statistics , we want to first determine the parameters corresponding to the diffusive regime and confirm that , for simple eigenfunction statistics , our computations match previous analytical and numerical work .",
    "we do not carry out a comprehensive comparison with past results but rather present enough to convincingly show that rmt augmented by rpw or perturbative techniques accounts for these properties , all as a prelude to the striking disagreement presented in the next section . for simplicity , we start with @xmath22 and study only eigenfunctions in the low - energy range most relevant to mesoscopic physics .",
    "we begin by establishing the disorder strength @xmath5 corresponding to diffusivity .",
    "to do this , we consider the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) : @xmath24 @xmath18 is the area of the system , and we understand the integral to be taken as a discrete sum over lattice sites .",
    "the ipr is closely linked to the degree of localization within the system @xcite , and is inversely proportional to the volume in which the wavefunction is confined .",
    "large ipr values thus correspond to strongly localized states .",
    "it can be derived from basic rmt that the ipr for a time - reversal invariant system should have a universal mean value of 3.0 , with small variations from this mean @xcite .",
    "chaotic systems , and weakly disordered experimental systems , do show a mean of 3.0 , with a nearly symmetrical distribution around this value @xcite .",
    "the mean ipr obtained by averaging over disorder realizations has been extensively studied numerically for both two- and three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the expectation is that the ipr should remain roughly constant for disorder values in the diffusive regime , and then should rise sharply for greater disorder values in the localized regime .",
    "figure  [ ipragw ] shows our results for the variation of @xmath25 against disorder strength for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 filling .",
    "note three important features : ipr is consistently higher for the lower energy band , ipr rises with disorder strength , and the pattern of this trend suggests three separate regimes of behavior . between @xmath26 and 0.3 , we see a saturating increase in both graphs ; between @xmath27 and 0.5 , we see a linear trend , especially in the @xmath9 case ; and for higher @xmath5 values , we see rapidly increasing behavior .",
    "it is reasonable to expect these three statistically distinct regimes to correspond , at least roughly , to the three physically relevant regimes : semi - ballistic , diffusive , and localized .",
    "figure  [ ipragw ] thus suggests we can choose @xmath28 , 0.5 and 0.8 or higher as representative values of these three regimes in the @xmath9 filling case .",
    "filling , corresponds to the diffusive regime .",
    "rmt predicts a universal value of 3.0 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the system is a @xmath7 rectangle , at @xmath22 , with 5 disorder realizations and about 400 different states used in each case.,width=288 ]    for further verification that these disorder values correspond to the diffusive regime , we find the three characteristic length scales for our system : the electron wavelength , the mean free path @xmath29 , and the localization length , @xmath30 . by comparing the size of the system , @xmath31 , to these three lengths",
    ", the various regimes are defined . in the diffusive regime one",
    "expects @xmath32 in the semi - ballistic regime , the system size is smaller than the mean free path , while in the localized regime , the localization length is smaller than the system size .",
    "according to calculations using the born approximation @xcite , at @xmath9 filling , @xmath33 , and at @xmath10 filling , @xmath34 . for @xmath31 , we take the small side of the rectangle , @xmath35 . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant found to be about 2 .",
    "@xmath38 , the number of transverse channels in the system , is based solely on the energy of the system , and is given by @xmath39 . at @xmath9 filling , @xmath40 ; at @xmath10 filling , @xmath41 .",
    "we can thus calculate , for the two energy levels , the required @xmath5 values for a diffusive regime : @xmath42 this confirms the choice of @xmath43 for @xmath9 filling as belonging in the diffusive regime ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , and prompts the choice of @xmath47 for @xmath10 filling ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "we can now begin to look at some of the basic statistics of our diffusive system and compare them to rmt prediction and experiment .",
    "for clarity , we will present only the @xmath9 filling results in the zero magnetic field case to establish general agreement , and then proceed to the lower energy when we add a magnetic field and begin to concentrate on the energy correlation statistics relevant to the coulomb blockade problem .",
    "one of the simplest and most comprehensively studied statistics is the distribution of the spacing between adjacent energy levels , @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "a basic result of rmt is that @xmath51 is very well approximated by the classic wigner surmise , given in the absence of a magnetic field by @xmath52 figure  [ lev0 ] compares this prediction with our calculated energy spacing distribution .",
    "we see excellent agreement on all parts of the graph ; the match is equally good for @xmath10 filling , not shown here .     and",
    "@xmath22.),width=288 ]    another well - studied statistic is the magnitude of the wave function at a single point . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", it is expected to follow the classic porter - thomas distribution @xcite @xmath53 both ballistic chaotic and weakly disordered systems show this behavior @xcite .",
    "the predicted ipr value of 3.0 is derived by taking the appropriate moment of this porter - thomas result .",
    "note the general rmt prediction of approximately uniformly extended wave functions ( in position space ) such that large wave function amplitudes are exponentially rare .",
    "figure  [ psi2 ] displays our results for the probability distribution of @xmath54 in the three different regimes .",
    "we see excellent agreement across the graph for the diffusive case , another indication that this system is truly diffusive .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the higher the disorder value @xmath5 , the greater the prevalence of both very large and very small @xmath54 values , indicating the system is becoming more localized and less uniform .",

    "rmt gives an overly simple prediction for these correlations : all off - diagonal terms are equivalent and have a value consistent with normalization of the wave function .",
    "a much more useful prediction can be obtained from berry s idea that a wavefunction of a chaotic system can be described as a random superposition of plane waves of the same wavenumber but different propagating direction @xcite .",
    "random plane wave ( rpw ) modeling gives predictions for both correlation functions above @xcite which agree with the perturbation theory results for the diffusive regime:@xcite @xmath60 the @xmath61 correlation should thus approach 0 , and the @xmath62 correlation should approach 1 for large @xmath63 .",
    "figures  [ sp1 ] and [ sp2 ] display our results for the diffusive regime , and show good agreement with the rpw predictions , especially in the @xmath61 correlation . at large distances",

    "rmt predicts that the correlation function should rapidly approach 1 .",
    "see figure  [ sp1 ] caption for parameters.,width=288 ]    the final characteristic we wish to consider before moving to statistics involving different eigenfunctions is the ipr distribution .",
    "previously , we touched on the mean ipr values for different parameters , but figure  [ ipr ] displays a histogram of ipr values for specific system realizations . as disorder increases across the three regimes , we see four important effects : the distribution gets wider and increasingly asymmetrical , and both the median and mode ipr values increase . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the distribution is gaussian - like near its maximum ( as it should be given the smallness of the cumulants beyond the second one@xcite ) , but the tails are clearly asymmetrical . in the large ipr tail , we find that the data follow an exponential distribution with a decay rate of @xmath68 ( obtained from fitting values larger than 3.4 ) .",
    "such an exponential decay is expected from calculations using the supersymmetric @xmath0-model @xcite . for our parameters ,",
    "the predicted decay rate is @xmath69 [ see e.g.  eq .  ( 3.92 ) in ref .  ] . considering that in our case @xmath70",
    "while the @xmath0-model is valid for @xmath71 , we find the good agreement between the @xmath0-model result and our observation above to be another demonstration of the universality present in these systems .",
    "we will return in section  [ sec - compare ] below to make a detailed comparison with the analytic results for the magnitude and variance of the ipr in the context of the correlation between different wavefunctions .",

    "the integral under each curve is normalized to 1 .",
    "( @xmath9 filling with @xmath74.),width=288 ]    we have now considered five separate statistics of varying complexity in the diffusive regime .",
    "energy level spacing , probability distribution at a point , and the two spatial correlation statistics all are in excellent agreement with rmt and rpw predictions .",
    "we note , however , that the latter three statistics depend on individual sites alone and not system - wide , or global , characteristics .",
    "ipr , a global statistic , seems at this level to be within the general framework of expectations .",
    "the establishment of this agreement serves two ends : justification that we are dealing with an authentic diffusive system of most relevance to mesoscopic physics , and confirmation that we are getting results for simple statistics that match previous work as well as analytical predictions .",
    "the latter demonstrates explicitly that the unexpected and complex correlations to be encountered in the next section are perfectly consistent with the simple and well - analyzed single - eigenfunction statistics familiar in disordered models , and so are likely to have wide application in disordered quantum physics .",
    "the spatial similarity of different eigenfunctions is crucially linked to electron - electron interactions and so to the statistics of quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "all data presented in this section are based on the quantity @xmath75 , defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 label different eigenfunctions .",
    "@xmath75 thus measures the system - wide , spatial correspondence between two eigenfunctions in a specific disorder realization .",
    "note that @xmath79 is the ipr , discussed in the previous section .",
    "rmt predicts no correlation between different eigenfunctions in the @xmath80 limit . in this case of uncorrelated uniformity , and within the weyl approximation",
    "@xmath81 mean @xmath75 should equal 1.0 for all @xmath82 , the statistics of the @xmath75 should be independent of @xmath77 or @xmath78 , and there should be no correlation between different @xmath75 .",
    "this section demonstrates that these basic predictions of rmt and its simple extensions ( such as rpw ) are not met in our diffusive system .       as a function of disorder strength .",
    "when averaged over all wave functions in our energy window ( circles ) , the mean rises roughly quadratically with increasing disorder strength from 1 , the rmt value .",
    "in contrast , for consecutive energy levels ( @xmath84 , squares ) , the mean is suppressed below 1 at weak disorder and shows evidence of the three regimes .",

    "one remarkable feature of fig .",
    "[ mijagw ] is that the mean ( over disorder and @xmath78 ) of @xmath86 for consecutive eigenvalues @xmath87 is substantially different from the result obtained by further averaging this quantity over the index @xmath77 , implying some degree of disorder and energy dependent correlations between the eigenfunction . to investigate this further , fig .",
    "[ mijagij ] plots mean @xmath75 against @xmath88 , indicating the correlation s dependence on the nearness in energy of the two eigenfunctions .",
    "we guess from figure  [ mijagij ] that the points of intersection in figure  [ mijagw ] represent the disorder levels at which @xmath75 is approximately constant against the difference in @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which we thus presume to be a characteristic of diffusive systems . in comparison ,",
    "the semi - ballistic system displays a slightly negative correlation for close energies and positive correlation for for distant energies .",
    "the localized system has a stronger positive correlation for close energies  states which are nearby in energy tend to overlap in space  which decreases as the energy difference increases .",
    "note that this is exactly the opposite of the well - known trend in the strongly localized case : when @xmath89 , states that are close in energy tend to occupy different parts of the sample @xcite .",
    "it is quite surprising that modest changes in @xmath5 could so drastically change how energy correlation operates in a system , going from increasing with energy difference to staying constant to decreasing and presumably back to increasing in the strong localization limit .     on the spacing between the two states for the three different regimes ( semi - ballistic at @xmath90 , diffusive at @xmath43 , and localized at @xmath91 ) .",
    "the point at which @xmath92 , corresponding to the ipr , is omitted for clarity .",

    "( @xmath9 filling with @xmath64.),width=288 ]    we can not , at this time , claim that we understand the origin of the energy correlation between the wave functions leading to the behavior observed for the @xmath75 s in figure  [ mijagij ] . in analytic treatments ,",
    "the energy scale known as the thouless energy plays an important role : for diffusive systems , @xmath93 is the energy scale related to the time @xmath94 needed to diffuse across the whole system . in both supersymmetric @xmath0-model and rmt / rpw approaches ,",
    "the expectation is that the mean @xmath75 would be independent of @xmath95 for energy differences less than @xmath96 and then approach 1 rapidly as a power law , @xmath97 [ see e.g.  eq .",
    "( 3.84 ) in ref . ] .",
    "this is clearly not the case in our data !",
    "we would like however to mention that , from a qualitative point of view , the observed energy correlation would be compatible with the existence of a relatively small number of _",
    "localized resonances_.    what we mean by a localized resonance is , in a very schematic way , what would result from the following picture .",
    "assume one can define an approximation @xmath98 of the anderson hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ am ] ) such that the eigenstates of @xmath98 can be divided in two classes : a vast majority of delocalized states @xmath99 , and a smaller number of very localized states @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , states which are in some sense `` anomalously localized '' are known to exist from supersymmetric @xmath0-model investigations @xcite .",
    "let us furthermore assume that the perturbation @xmath102 couples the @xmath100 to the @xmath99 with matrix elements whose typical magnitude @xmath103 is large compared to the mean level spacing @xmath104 , but small enough in terms of the energy spacing of the @xmath100 that these latter remain essentially decoupled .    in such a circumstance , we can model the eigenstates @xmath105 of the full hamiltonian @xmath106 near the energy @xmath107 of @xmath100 using a resonant level model , implying that @xmath108 here , @xmath109 is a delocalized wavefunction orthogonal to @xmath100 ( and not necessarily close to @xmath99 ) , @xmath110 is a fluctuating quantity of rms one , and the smooth positive function @xmath111 of width @xmath112 describes the envelope of the resonance .",
    "the resonance contains approximatively @xmath113 levels , and normalization imposes that within the resonance ( i.e. for @xmath114 ) , @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath116 is large enough , the normalization factor @xmath117 is not very far from one , and we shall drop it from now on .    if eq .",
    "( [ eq : elabet ] ) is a good model for the eigenstates of @xmath106 near the resonance , we see that , in this region of energy , the envelop of the @xmath75 should be given by ( neglecting terms of order @xmath118 ) @xmath119 if @xmath120 is not negligible compared to @xmath121 , such an expression provides a mechanism for increasing the mean value of @xmath75 , and furthermore would explain that this enhancement is larger if @xmath77 and @xmath78 are close in energy since this increases the probability that they belong to the same resonance .",
    "in the case of a torus ( periodic boundary conditions ) , we found that the enhancement of the @xmath75 s is smaller .",
    "we interpret this as implying that the localized resonances are preferentially created near the hard wall boundaries of the system ; this is actually the region where we see the first localized states appear as disorder is further increased .",
    "to finish this subsection , we comment briefly on two points .",
    "first , we mention that one statistic that may help explain some features of @xmath75 is the correlation of the wave - function with the disorder configuration of the system , defined as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the on - site disorder at @xmath124 and @xmath18 is the area of the system .",
    "our computational results demonstrate that this disorder correlation , negative ( for filling smaller than one half ) for all @xmath5 values , is proportional to the square of the disorder strength and , in fact , matches the value derived from perturbation theory .",
    "since individual wave - functions in a specific system are correlated to the same disorder configuration , they will be correlated to one another .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the amount of correlation thus induced is much smaller than that seen in the @xmath75 data .",
    "we finally note in passing that several statistics show periodic structure as a function of energy .",
    "the mean ipr and disorder correlation , for example , show small oscillatory effects when plotted against eigenfunction number .",
    "as the trends are more prominent in the torus or smaller systems , they are most likely due to periodic orbit effects .",
    "however , persistence of this odd behavior when the smallest period is about four times the mean free path , suggests some extra relationship may influence how wave - functions at specific energies interact .       through @xmath126 ) .",
    "the curves at three different energies , all in the diffusive regime , match the corresponding wigner surmise of rmt ( solid ) .",
    "both the mean and integral are normalized to  1.,width=288 ]",
    "because we want to eventually study interaction effects in the coulomb blockade regime , and for these latter the discussion of the zero magnetic field case is made more complicated by the partial screening of the cooper channel @xcite , we shall now consider a situation where a magnetic field is applied , effectively suppressing the time reversal invariance of the system .",
    "for the coulomb blockade , we should like to choose a system in the diffusive regime containing a few hundred electron .",
    "these considerations lead us to pick the following parameters : @xmath10 filling corresponding to about level 400 ; @xmath47 ; and @xmath127 , the field strength at which the statistics indicating broken time - invariance appear to level off as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "we also wish to supplement this system with data for an intermediate energy range .",
    "thus , three such systems will be investigated : our favored system at @xmath10 filling and @xmath47 ; a system at @xmath9 filling and @xmath43 , for comparison with the @xmath22 case ; and an intermediate system at @xmath128 filling and @xmath43 .",
    "our first concern is to establish that the three systems with non - zero magnetic field are diffusive .",
    "figure  [ lev6 ] plots each system s energy level spacing distribution along with the relevant wigner surmise ( gue for broken time - reversal invariance ) .",
    "we see excellent agreement in all three cases , an indication of diffusivity .",
    "in addition , note that the discussion of length - scales  mean free path , system size , and localization length  in section  [ rmt ] holds unchanged for the weak field considered , and so suggests diffusivity in each of our three cases .",

    "no comparison of these will be made to analytic results , however , because no such results exist .",
    "there are two caveats that one should bear in mind in making a comparison between the analytic results and our data .",
    "first , the analytic results are primarily for eigenfunctions that are close by in energy , within @xmath96 of each other",
    ". there are no previous results , as far as we know , for our main finding that @xmath179 grows for large @xmath142 because of correlations between eigenstates widely separated in energy .",
    "the second caveat is that the @xmath0-model results are obtained in a somewhat different regime from our numerics : the @xmath0-model assumes @xmath71 while for our numerical results @xmath70 .",
    "the analytic approaches predict that three trends should be present in the data .",
    "first , the energy dependence : the deviations from simplest rmt should be proportional to the square root of the filling @xcite . for our data , then , the deviations in the @xmath10-filling column should be twice those at @xmath9-filling ( both at @xmath131 ) .",
    "we see that for the mean , this is certainly the case . for the standard deviation ,",
    "the ratio ranges from @xmath180 for the ipr to @xmath181 for the far - off - diagonal case .",
    "thus , this trend is quite reasonably obeyed by our data .",
    "second , in the analytic approaches , the statistics of the ipr , @xmath79 , is simply related to the statistics of the off - diagonal terms @xmath75 . for the mean of the distribution , the @xmath0-model approach yields @xcite @xmath182 our @xmath22 data is in good agreement with this result , for both the nearest neighbor values @xmath183 and the far - off - diagonal terms @xmath75 .",
    "note however that the ratio for our @xmath131 data differs sharply from the above : for nearest neighbors the ratio is about 3 and increases to 5 or 6 for the far - off - diagonal terms . turning to the standard deviation of the distribution ,",

    "overall , then , the agreement between our data and this analytic trend is mixed : the results for the mean at zero field and the fluctuation of the nearest - neighbor terms is good , but those for the mean at non - zero field and the fluctuation of far - off - diagonal terms is poor .",
    "the third predicted trend is , of course , the relation between the results at zero magnetic field and those at non - zero field . for the mean , the @xmath0-model yields @xcite @xmath186 in our data , however , the deviations in the mean are approximately independent of magnetic field . for the fluctuations ,",
    "those of the ipr are expected to be larger by a factor of 3 in the presence of time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "we see a factor of 1.6 in our data .",
    "thus there is a striking disagreement between the @xmath0-model treatment and our numerics in terms of the effect of a weak magnetic field .    to summarize our results with regard to the trends , some of the analytic predictions are seen in our data but others are not : the energy dependence checks , the behavior of the ipr compared to off - diagonal terms is mixed , and , most strikingly , the expected effects of breaking time - reversal symmetry",
    "are just not seen in the data . with regard to the latter , we emphasize that the simpler effects of breaking time - reversal symmetry , such as the change in level spacing distribution or distribution of @xmath187 , are certainly seen in our data , so the discrepancy here is not simply a matter of having applied too weak a field .    to make a more exacting comparison of the data and analytic results , we now compare the absolute magnitude of the deviation of the mean and the variance of the distribution . in order to do this , we need to first settle on a value for @xmath188 , the dimensionless conductance , which is the main parameter controlling the expansion in the @xmath0-model results .",
    "standard expressions exist for the conductance @xmath189 in the strongly diffusive limit ( @xmath71 ) as well as for @xmath190 , the ballistic conductance ( @xmath191 ) assuming random scattering on the boundaries . for our parameters we find at 1/25 filling @xmath192 and @xmath193 while at 1/100 filling the values are @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "our system is intermediate between these two limits .",
    "surely the conductance can not be larger than @xmath196 as this is the fundamental bound coming from the finiteness of the system .",
    "in fact , as a function of system size @xmath31 while keeping other parameters constant , the conductance should cross over from @xmath197 to the value @xmath189 which is independent of @xmath31 . as our system is clearly in this cross - over region , use of an interpolation formula",
    "appears necessary .",
    "we use the simplest such formula : @xmath198 .",
    "thus the conductance values we use are @xmath199 for 1/25 filling and @xmath200 for 1/100 filling .    with these values for @xmath201 , the @xmath0-model expressions @xcite in the diffusive limit",
    "are easily evaluated .",
    "as the trends have been discussed above in detail , we give only a few representative values here . in the absence of time - reversal symmetry",
    ", we find @xmath202 at @xmath9 filling and @xmath203 at @xmath10 filling . comparing with the table , we see that for the fluctuations the numerical data are in good agreement with the diffusive @xmath0-model results .",
    "in contrast , the deviation of the mean ipr from the rmt value is rather far off from the @xmath0-model predictions above .",
    "it is curious that once the scaling is done to change these values to those appropriate in the presence of time - reversal symmetry [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : bscaling ] ) ] , the fluctuations are not in agreement while the mean value of the ipr is .",
    "to summarize this section , we saw that there is already for the @xmath75 statistics some substantial differences between our computational result and extensions of random matrix theory via the @xmath0-model .",
    "some of these differences are merely quantitative , and might be explained by the fact that the regime we consider , where the mean free path is of order the system size , is not the one typically considered in @xmath0-model calculations .",
    "other differences , such as the existence of correlations among the @xmath75 are qualitative , and thus less expected .    the second kind of `` integrated '' statistics that we have considered concerns the @xmath135 s , which involve a further summation over states . for these quantities , we are not aware of any analytic results .",
    "the fluctuations of the @xmath135 s show , however , ( see fig .",
    "[ fjpfj ] ) an absence of saturation which is in total contradiction with intuition developed for simpler quantities .",
    "all these differences suggest that disordered quantum systems may be a tougher nut to crack than previously thought .",
    "a major way to probe the energy properties of electrons in a disordered media is by constraining groups of electrons in a quantum dot and studying the electrical transport of individual electrons across the dot .",
    "the electrostatic charging energy being large , the dot is usually constrained to remain with a fixed number of electrons , which prevents current to flow at small bias voltage .",
    "this coulomb blockade effect is essentially classical , and allows an applied gate voltage @xmath204 to be adjusted so that the energy for @xmath205 electrons is the same as that for @xmath206 , thereby inducing a finite conductance .",
    "the conductance through the dot as a function of @xmath204 therefore forms a series of sharp peaks , the height and position of which encode information about the dot s ground state @xcite .",
    "the peak spacing , with which we are most concerned here , is proportional to the second difference of the ground state energy with respect to electron number @xmath205 : @xmath207 which varies because of changing interaction effects as electrons are added and produces a peak spacing distribution . the simplest model of this distribution results from writing the ground state energy as the sum of the classical charging energy and the energies of the occupied single particle states , known as the constant - interaction ( ci ) model . the ground state energy in this model",
    "can therefore be written in terms of the occupation numbers @xmath208 and one particle energies @xmath209 as @xmath210 where @xmath211 for the @xmath205 lowest orbitals and zero otherwise .    as a consequence ,",
    "one gets the simple prediction @xmath212 the drastic odd / even difference is a quantum effect resulting from the spin of the electron .",
