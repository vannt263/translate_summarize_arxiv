    "<S> whose functionality is structure - based ? in its simplest form , </S>",
    "<S> we seek an object which takes on just a few distinct geometries in a reproducible manner and is able to switch reversibly between them due to thermal fluctuations . such a situation would allow external stabilizing influences to favor a given conformation over the others and allow for the development of powerful machines at the nanoscale .    </S>",
    "<S> a collection of hard spheres constitutes the simplest model of matter and exhibits both a crystalline phase and a fluid phase on varying the density of spheres@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a linear chain of hard spheres is the simplest connected object with the fewest constraints and thus the greatest flexibility@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a chain , at high temperatures or when there are no interactions promoting compaction , would occupy a random coil phase in which all self - avoiding conformations are equally likely . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is not conducive for machine design . in the presence of inter - sphere interactions promoting compaction and when there are no frustrating influences from the sphere tethering </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect a generic compact phase in which , at least locally , the preferred conformation is that of a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured by kepler , and proven more recently by hales , that the fcc structure provides for optimal packing of unconstrained spheres@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is again a high degeneracy of compact conformations with no assurance that any given conformation will be reached from a random coil conformation rapidly and reproducibly . </S>",
    "<S> again , this situation is not conducive for the design of machines .    of course , what one requires is a phase of matter with much fewer ground state conformations than either the random coil or generic compact phase . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , one needs a phase which is in the vicinity of a phase transition ( or crossover for finite size systems ) to a distinct phase , because that provides for exquisite sensitivity to the right types of external influences . </S>",
    "<S> our thinking is guided by the liquid crystal phase@xcite which is a distinct state of matter that is poised in the vicinity of the liquid phase . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is known to be one of the most sensitive phases of matter . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid crystal phase opens up because of the anisotropy of the constituent molecules  there is no longer a need for simultaneous ordering in all three directions . </S>",
    "<S> rather , one can have translational order in fewer than three dimensions and orientational order . here </S>",
    "<S> we address the issue of how one might open up a distinct phase with relatively few ground state conformations in the vicinity of the random coil phase . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase would then be the analog of a liquid crystal phase but this time for chain molecules .     with a separation along the chain @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the nearest neighbor spheres along the backbone are allowed to overlap with each other thereby overtly introducing uniaxial anisotropy . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the tangent and normal vectors assigned to each sphere , @xmath3 , except to those at the ends of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> side - spheres ( shown in pink ) of radius @xmath4 are attached to the backbone spheres in the negative normal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the side - spheres are not allowed to overlap with either the backbone spheres or with each other . </S>",
    "<S> , width=230 ]    armed with insights from the liquid crystal phase and the behavior of proteins , we identify two mechanisms for thinning the number of candidate ground state structures and demonstrate that these are sufficient for the creation of the sought after behavior . </S>",
    "<S> one can define a frenet reference frame ( a local cartesian coordinate system ) at each location of the chain molecule comprised of the tangent , the normal , and the binormal as the orthogonal coordinate axes . </S>",
    "<S> these coordinate systems play a crucial role in at least two ways , as can be readily seen in the protein context : first , the chemistry of hydrogen bonds and other chemical features yield constraints on the relative orientations between the coordinate systems associated with pairs of amino acids in contact ; second , the side - chains of amino acids are located in a specified direction with respect to these coordinate systems - for example , the amino acid side chains are typically pointed approximately in the outward normal direction . indeed , both the @xmath5-helix and the @xmath6-sheet allow for the placement of side - chains in a manner that avoids steric clashes .     in the @xmath7 plane for chains of length @xmath8=12 without side - spheres ( @xmath9 ) and with side - spheres ( @xmath10 ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate compact phase arises on the edge of compaction of the chain molecule when @xmath11 becomes sufficiently large to allow the attractive interaction to be effective . </S>",
    "<S> the vicinity of this phase to other phases ( it is sandwiched between two distinct phases ) confers sensitivity to structures in the intermediate compact phase . </S>",
    "<S> the other panels show typical ground state conformations : a random coil conformation obtained with @xmath12 ( * c * ) , a globule conformation obtained with @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( * d * ) , a saddle conformation obtained with @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( * e * ) , several helix conformations with different pitch to radius ratios obtained for @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( * f * ) , @xmath15 , @xmath19 ( * g * ) , and @xmath20 , @xmath14 ( * h * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the helical and saddle ground state conformations in the model with no side - spheres are retained even when side - spheres are present ( @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the side - spheres eliminate several random globule and random coil conformations thereby stabilizing the intermediate compact phase . </S>",
    "<S> , width=307 ]    the first mechanism follows from the observation that a model of a chain comprised of spheres is unable to capture the inherent anisotropy induced by the presence of the chain constraint  at each location of the chain , there is a tangent direction defined by the two adjacent objects . </S>",
    "<S> thus the simplest model capturing the correct symmetry is one in which the constituent monomers are no longer * isotropic*. we therefore allow for the overlap of van der waals spheres of adjacent monomers along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> such an overlap overtly breaks the isotropy of the spheres and confers uniaxial anisotropy to the chain . in </S>",
    "<S> both the emergent building blocks of protein structures , @xmath5-helices and @xmath6-sheets , nearby segments are placed right up against each other and aligned parallel to each other , reflecting the anisotropy . in a protein , the distance between neighboring c@xmath22 atoms is @xmath23 requiring that the radius of the backbone of an amino acid be larger than @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint is easily met by considering the van der waals radii of the constituent atoms . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one would estimate@xcite that the smallest amino acid , glycine , has a radius larger than @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we study the effect of attaching side - chains to the backbone monomer , e.g. , in the negative normal direction . the self - avoidance of these side spheres with each other and with the backbone spheres results in an induced coupling between pairs of frenet frames .     with @xmath26 , @xmath21 , and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> ( * a * ) the temperature dependence of the specific heat indicates two peaks  one at @xmath28 and another at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower temperature peak indicates a crossover into a single helix conformation from a dual helix , whereas the peak at the higher temperature indicates a crossover between the dual helix and the random coil phases . </S>",
    "<S> ( * b * ) contour plot of the effective free energy as a function of energy and contact order , @xmath30 , at the lower transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 , is defined as the sum over sequence separation of all contacts divided by the product of the number of contacts and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective free energy at a given temperature @xmath31 is determined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a weighted two - dimensional histogram for that temperature obtained using the multiple histogram method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the unweighted histograms at multiple temperatures are collected through parallel tempering@xcite monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy difference between consecutive contour levels is @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the contour plot shows two minima corresponding to the single helix and the dual helix as indicated . </S>",
    "<S> , width=288 ]    we find that each of these features results in the creation of a distinct intermediate phase for short chains sandwiched between the generic compact phase and the random coil phase . furthermore , when the two features are combined , the phase is stabilized and occupies a larger region in parameter space . for our simplified model of a chain of backbone spheres ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) with a sphere separation along the sequence of @xmath23 , we have three length parameters : the radius , @xmath35 , of the backbone spheres , the radius , @xmath4 , of the side - spheres , and the cut - off scale , @xmath11 , for the pairwise attractive interaction potential , @xmath36 , between the backbone spheres ( see materials and methods ) . in the absence of side - spheres and for non - overlapping backbone spheres , @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a crossover from a random coil phase ( in which the conformations are mostly extended ) to a globule phase in which one has compact conformations with no distinct motifs such as helices . </S>",
    "<S> the situation becomes qualitatively different on incorporating one or both of the two key features .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a shows the @xmath38 phase diagrams in the @xmath35@xmath11 plane for a @xmath39 chain . </S>",
    "<S> distinct phases , corresponding to helical and saddle - like conformations , emerge between the coil and the globular phases analogous to the opening up of a liquid crystal phase between the liquid and crystalline phases for anisotropic molecules@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saddle can be thought of as a piece of a dual helix structure and does develop into a dual helix for longer chains . </S>",
    "<S> ( the dual helix is distinct from the double helix because the former is a conformation of a single chain whereas the latter is comprised of two chains . ) </S>",
    "<S> these phases have a lower entropy than both the globule and random coil ( swollen ) phases but are stabilized by the attractive interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the presence of side - spheres even without overlap of the backbone spheres induces helical conformations ( figure s1 in si ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is accentuated when both features are present simultaneously ( figure s2 in si ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , conformations composed of nearly parallel strands similar to those in @xmath6-sheets can be obtained by adding a bending energy into the model ( figure s3 in si ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider an even shorter system ( @xmath40 ) with an enhanced overlap of the backbone spheres : @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the side - sphere is chosen to be @xmath21 , and the range of attraction is now increased to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> these parameter values yield a helix ground state but is close to a crossover to the dual helix state . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a shows that the specific heat has two peaks corresponding to two crossover temperatures , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . at the lowest temperatures , the helix is the dominant conformation . at intermediate temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the dual helix structure , whereas , at higher temperatures , one obtains a random coil . </S>",

    "<S> contact order plane at @xmath44 and exhibits pronounced minima corresponding to the single helix and dual helix . the helix is a bit lower in energy while the dual helix is entropically more favorable . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy barrier for the switching at @xmath44 is about @xmath34 which is equivalent to the energy required to break 4 contacts . </S>",
    "<S> this barrier is significantly higher than @xmath45 and the two helical conformations are each quite stable at this temperature . </S>",
    "<S> quite remarkably , our monte carlo simulations with standard pivot and crankshaft move sets show a dynamical switching between the two conformations in a single trajectory at a somewhat higher temperature of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the system is bistable with a rapid switching between distinct conformations ( for examples of molecular switches , see refs.@xcite ) with little weight for intermediate conformations ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . note that the switching can also be easily effected by means of an external influence which is sensitive to the chain end - to - end distance .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the ease with which one obtains this system without any fine - tuning of details is made possible by the existence of the intermediate phase . </S>",
    "<S> the conformations in this phase are in the vicinity of the random coil phase while retaining order due to the proximity of the compact phase . </S>",
    "<S> this results in special sensitivity to small perturbations induced , e.g. , by thermal fluctuations which , in the example presented here , are responsible for the switching between two distinct geometrical shapes . unlike the random coil conformations which can switch from one to another easily due to thermal fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> the structures in the intermediate phase exhibit some stability . at the same time , the structures are not so densely compact that they are subject to sluggish dynamics and kinetic inaccessibility characteristic of the glassy phase . </S>",
    "<S> these distinct advantages of the intermediate phase have a wider applicability than for chain molecules as evidenced by the sensitive liquid crystal phase sandwiched between the crystalline and liquid phases . in liquid crystals , </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy arises from the asymmetric shape of the constituent molecules , whereas here the anisotropy is a natural consequence of the chain topology of the molecule . </S>",

    "<S> for example , a liquid possesses certain gross properties , such as adopting the shape of the container and its ability to flow , irrespective of its constituent molecules and their underlying chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> globular proteins share a great deal of common characteristics - they are all linear chains of the same 20 amino acids , they fold rapidly and reproducibly into their native state structures , these structures are made up of emergent building blocks in the form of helices and almost planar sheets , the total number of distinct folds that proteins adopt is limited in number@xcite much as the number of space groups associated with bravais lattices@xcite is @xmath47 , proteins are flexible and versatile in their folded state , and proteins have a tendency to aggregate and form amyloid which in turn is implicated in debilitating human diseases . </S>",
    "<S> these common attributes of proteins suggest that protein structures occupy an intermediate phase of matter@xcite which confers on them their many amazing characteristics .    , shows frequent switches between the single helix ( lower contact order ) and the dual helix ( higher contact order ) . </S>",
