    "observables sensitive to the transverse momentum of quarks and gluons inside a hadron have a long theoretical and experimental history .",
    "they have proven to be valuable tools to test the qcd dynamics at high - energy colliders , extending the information provided by observables integrated over the intrinsic transverse momenta . at large transverse momentum",
    "these observables can be computed in perturbation theory , but if the transverse momentum @xmath5 is much smaller than the probe of the hard reaction @xmath6 , then large logarithms of their ratio appear and resummation becomes a must in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "this issue was already addressed in the eighties by collins , soper and sterman  @xcite .",
    "the main hadronic quantities in observables at @xmath7 are the transverse momentum dependent functions ( tmds ) , first considered by ralston and soper  @xcite and by collins and soper  @xcite .",
    "the tmds represent , generally speaking , the probability of finding a parton inside a hadron with a definite transverse momentum , i.e. , tmd parton distribution functions ( tmdpdfs ) ; or the probability that a quark or gluon fragments into a hadron with a given transverse momentum ( tmdffs ) .",
    "they play an important role in the rich phenomenology of azimuthal and spin asymmetries ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "after the pioneering works , much effort has been devoted to properly describe the polarization of the partons / hadrons , the universality of tmds and other relevant properties .",
    "however , the `` naive '' ( old ) definitions introduced in  @xcite and considered in subsequent works , suffer from undesired features preventing them from properly represent physical hadronic quantities , such as uncancelled rapidity divergences .",
    "recently collins  @xcite and echevarria - idilbi - scimemi  @xcite have revisited and updated the definition of quark tmds , making it consistent with a generic factorization theorem and free from the bad features .",
    "having at our disposal the proper definition for such quantities allows us to better deal with physical processes where they appear and from which we want to extract sensible information on the hadron structure .",
    "thus , it is the goal of the present work to extend those efforts to the gluon tmds , relevant for instance in processes such as higgs boson and quarkonium production in hadron - hadron collisions .    in order to properly define all the leading - twist ( un)polarized gluon tmdpdfs we consider the higgs boson transverse momentum distribution , generated mainly through the gluon - gluon fusion process .",
    "thus , gluon tmdpdfs will be the relevant hadronic quantities necessary to build our observable .",
    "inclusive higgs boson production in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions , has received much attention , both in the context of standard perturbative qcd ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "tmd gluon correlators were also considered in  @xcite .",
    "however none of the previous works paid attention to the cancellation of rapidity divergences in a proper definition of gluon tmdpdfs . in this paper",
    "we reconsider the higgs @xmath5-distribution in hadron - hadron collisions , but with general polarizations , in order to obtain not only the properly defined unpolarized gluon tmdpdf , but also the polarized ones , i.e. , all the leading - twist ( un)polarized gluon tmdpdfs .",
    "their proper definition is crucial in order to be able to address different processes where they are relevant , such as quarkonium ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) or heavy - quark pair production ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and perform consistent phenomenological analyses .    in this work",
    "we pay special attention to three of the eight leading - twist gluon tmdpdfs , calculate them explicitly at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and demonstrate that the rapidity divergences cancel in their proper definitions . on one hand , the distributions of unpolarized ( @xmath8 ) and linearly polarized ( @xmath9 ) gluons inside an unpolarized hadron , and , on the other hand , the gluon helicity tmdpdf ( @xmath2 ) , which represents the distribution of longitudinally polarized gluons inside a longitudinally polarized hadron .",
    "the calculation not only supports the definitions introduced in this work , but also allows us to extract valuable perturbative ingredients to resum large logarithms and better control their non - perturbative parts , eventually improving our description of experimental data .",
    "we emphasize that the calculation of @xmath2 is done for the first time , while for @xmath8 and @xmath9 one could combine previous results and then carefully recast them into the new tmd formalism .",
    "the evolution of the gluon tmdpdfs , as in the case of quark tmds  @xcite , turns out to be universal , i.e. , the same evolution kernel describes the evolution of any of the leading - twist ( un)polarized gluon tmdpdfs .",
    "it is interesting to contrast this finding with the evolution of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and double parton distributions ( dpds ) which have vastly different evolution depending on the polarization ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a direct comparison for dpds ) .",
    "the currently known perturbative ingredients allow us to use the evolution equations to resum the large logarithms up to next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) accuracy .",
    "moreover , if we consider the perturbative coefficients of the operator product expansion ( ope ) of those tmds at large transverse momentum , also some parts of them turn out to be universal . exploiting this feature ,",
    "we introduce a further step to resum the large logarithms that appear in the ope coefficients , exponentiating the double logarithms and improving the convergence of the resummation .",
    "thus we provide a general framework to deal with ( un)polarized gluon tmdpdfs in different processes and account for their perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "drawing attention to the distribution of linearly polarized gluons inside an unpolarized hadron , several works have addressed their role at the lhc ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", in @xcite the authors quantified their contribution in the context of the tmd formalism , both for higgs boson and @xmath3-even scalar quarkonium ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) production . in the present work",
    "we extend their efforts by implementing the currently known perturbative ingredients to the full extent to perform the resummation at nnll accuracy , providing more accurate predictions and discussing their uncertainty .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : factorization ]",
    "we apply the scet machinery to derive the factorization theorem for the higgs @xmath5-distribution in polarized hadron - hadron collisions in terms of well - defined gluon tmdpdfs . in section  [ sec : evolution ]",
    "we discuss the qcd evolution of all the leading - twist gluon tmdpdfs , which turns out to be driven by a universal evolution kernel .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : refactorization ] we address the refactorization of tmdpdfs in terms of collinear functions , which applies when the transverse momentum is in the perturbative domain . in section  [ sec : tmdhelicity ] we consider the gluon helicity tmdpdf ( @xmath2 ) , that accounts for longitudinally polarized gluons inside a longitudinally polarized hadron , and perform a numerical study of the function itself and the impact of evolution . in section  [ sec : tmdsunpolhadron ] we analyze the tmdpdfs that contribute in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions , i.e. , unpolarized and linearly polarized gluons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ) , and give some estimates of their relative contributions at different scales .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : pheno ] we study the higgs boson transverse momentum distribution , paying special attention to the role played by linearly polarized gluons and the non - perturbative effects .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "below we derive the factorization theorem for the higgs @xmath5-distribution in polarized hadron - hadron collisions , @xmath12 , by performing a set of consecutive matchings between different effective field theories , relevant at each scale : @xmath13 in the first step we integrate out the top quark mass , @xmath14 , to build an effective @xmath15 coupling . in the second matching",
    "we integrate out the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath16 , and obtain a factorized cross - section in terms of well - defined gluon tmdpdfs , which holds for @xmath17 .",
    "those gluon tmdpdfs will be expressed in terms of fundamental hadronic matrix elements .",
    "finally , in the region @xmath18 , we can further refactorize the gluon tmdpdfs in terms of the collinear gluon / quark pdfs , integrating out the large scale @xmath5 .    before discussing the steps in the derivation of the factorization theorem",
    ", we introduce the notation used through the paper .",
    "a generic vector @xmath19 is decomposed as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we also use @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 .",
    "the production of the higgs boson through gluon - gluon fusion is well approximated by the effective local interaction  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the qcd coupling at factorization scale @xmath29 , @xmath30 the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath31 is the higgs field and @xmath32gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "the explicit expressions for the wilson coefficient @xmath33 and its evolution can be found in appendix  [ app : ads ] . using the effective lagrangian just introduced , the differential cross section for higgs production is factorized as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "this expression manifests the first step in the matching procedure , where we integrate out the large top quark mass through the perturbative coefficient @xmath33 .",

    "transverse gauge links need to be added ( as described in @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we stick to feynman gauge for perturbative calculations , and thus transverse gauge links do not play any role . the wilson matching coefficient @xmath43 , which corresponds to the infrared finite part of the gluon form factor calculated in pure dimensional regularization , is given at one - loop by @xmath44 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in appendix  [ app : hard ] we report our explicit nlo calculation , and appendix  [ app : ads ] gives the evolution and higher order contributions .",
    "we anticipate here that for the phenomenological study discussed in section  [ sec : pheno ] we perform the so - called `` @xmath45-resummation '' , which consists on choosing the scale in the above coefficient as @xmath46 . in this way the convergence of the hard part is improved .",
    "see  @xcite for more details .",
    "after some standard algebraic manipulations and a taylor expansion in order to retain the leading order contribution in @xmath47 , the cross - section can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the rapidity of the produced higgs boson .",
    "the born - level cross section is @xmath53 the _ pure _ collinear matrix elements and the soft function are defined as @xmath54 notice that , in order to avoid double counting , one needs to subtract the contribution of soft momentum modes ( the so - called `` zero - bin '' in the scet nomenclature ) from the naively calculated collinear matrix elements , thus obtaining the `` pure collinear '' matrix elements , denoted by the superscript @xmath55 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) . note that in eq .",
    "we have applied the scet machinery to decouple the collinear , anticollinear and soft modes , removing the interactions between them from the lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "thus the factorization of any operator in scet is straighforward , as well as the final states @xmath56 , which can be written in the factorized form @xmath57 , describing the collinear , anticollinear and soft states .",
    "as shown in appendices [ app : tmdpdfnlo ] , [ app : linearnlo ] and [ app : helicitynlo ] by performing an explicit nlo perturbative calculation of unpolarized , linearly polarized and helicity gluon tmdpdfs , the collinear and soft matrix elements defined above are individually ill - defined , since they contain uncancelled rapidity divergences .",
    "we stress the fact that this issue is independent of the particular regulator used .",
    "thus , we need to combine them in a certain way to cancel these divergences and obtain well - defined hadronic quantities . based on the work done in @xcite for the quark case and using @xmath58 to label generic parameters that regulate the rapidity divergences present in the ( anti-)collinear and soft matrix elements , then the tmdpdfs are defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 are auxiliary energy scales , the twiddle labels the functions in impact parameter space ( ips ) and we have split the soft function in rapidity space as @xmath61 the soft function can be split to all orders in perturbation theory , regardless which particular regulator is used , following the same logic as in @xcite . in that work",
    "this fundamental property was proven for the soft function relevant for quark tmds .",
    "the proof for the soft function that appears in the gluon tmds follows analogously , simply changing the color representation from the fundamental to the adjoint . the arbitrariness in the choice of the rapidity cutoff to split the soft function , which is not explicitly shown in eq .",
    ", manifests itself as the appearance of the auxiliary energy scales @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which are bound together by @xmath64 .",
    "resorting to the @xmath65-regulator for definiteness , the soft function is split as @xmath66 where we have explicitly shown the dependence on the regulator parameters and @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with @xmath69 an arbitrary boost invariant real parameter .",
    "we point out that an explicit dependence on @xmath38 has been added as well in the soft function .",
    "this is due to the use of the @xmath65-regulator , which induces such dependence , in consistency with the fact that the soft function represents the cross - talking between the two collinear sectors . on the contrary",
    ", pure collinear matrix elements do not have any remnant information about the opposite collinear sector , and thus can not depend on @xmath38 .",
    "now , using eq .",
    "the gluon tmdpdfs are defined as @xmath70 these hadronic quantities are free from rapidity divergences ,",
    "i.e. , they have well - behaved evolution properties and can be extracted from experimental data .",
    "as already mentioned , when one performs the perturbative calculations of the collinear matrix elements , depending on the particular regulator that is used , the issue of double counting the soft modes arises . in this case , one needs to subtract , on a diagram - by - diagram basis , the soft limit of each collinear contribution ( the `` zero - bin '' ) . with the @xmath65-regulator one can show order by order in perturbation theory that the subtraction of the zero - bin for each collinear matrix element is equivalent to divide it by the soft function : @xmath71 the naively calculated collinear matrix elements , which do not have the label @xmath55 anymore , depend on the hard scale @xmath38 and the two regulator parameters @xmath72 , in contrast with the _ pure _ collinear matrix elements .",
    "the latter should depend only on the regulator that belongs to each collinear sector .",
    "the naive collinear matrix elements depend as well on the spurious regulator for the other sector .",
    "thus , for the particular case of this regulator we can define the tmdpdfs as @xmath73 notice that the spurious regulator in the naive collinear matrix elements is now cancelled by dividing them by the proper piece of the soft function , thus recovering the correct regulator dependence in the tmdpdfs as in eq .  .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the proper definition of tmdpdfs in eq .",
    "is independent of the particular regulator used .",
    "we have given their definition using the @xmath65-regulator , although one could conveniently modify eq .   in order to use , for instance , the rapidity regulator introduced in @xcite .",
    "one could also follow the lines of @xcite , where no regulator is used , i.e. , the rapidity divergences among the collinear and soft matrix elements are cancelled by combining ( before integration ) the integrands of the relevant feynman diagrams order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "now , we can write the cross - section for the higgs @xmath5-distribution in terms of well - defined gluon tmdpdfs : @xmath74 this factorized cross - section is valid for @xmath17 . in the next section",
    "we discuss the refactorization of the tmdpdfs in terms of collinear functions when the transverse momentum is a perturbative scale , i.e. , when @xmath18 .    before moving to the next factorization step , we first need to consider the dependence on the hadron spin and separate the unpolarized ( u ) , longitudinally polarized ( l ) and transversely polarized ( t ) situations . in @xcite",
    "the authors obtained the decomposition of collinear correlators at leading - twist .",
    "we emphasize the fact that these correlators suffer from rapidity divergences and thus can not be considered well - defined hadronic quantities . the decomposition , however , is not directly affected by this issue and follows equivalently .",
    "below , given the proper definition of gluon tmdpdfs in eq .",

    "these three functions are the only tmdpdfs which are matched onto leading twist collinear matrix elements , i.e. , the canonical pdfs .",
    "the wilson line structure in the operator definition of the tmdpdfs gives rise to calculable process dependence .",
    "in the types of processes considered here , where two gluons fuse into a color singlet , the wilson lines are past pointing . in a process where color would flow into the final state , also future pointing wilson lines play a role .",
    "functions with different wilson line structure differ by matrix elements containing intrinsically nonlocal gluonic pole contributions  @xcite . depending on the number of such gluonic poles being odd or even , the functions are t - odd or t - even .",
    "the functions come with specific process - dependent gluonic pole factors that can lead to a breaking of universality , in the simplest cases giving rise to a sign change , such as the sivers function having a different sign in drell - yan and in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes .",
    "other functions , such as @xmath1 need to be written as a linear combination of two or even more functions , with the coefficient in the linear combination depending on the wilson lines and in turn on the color flow in the process  @xcite . however , for both the gluon - gluon fusion into a color singlet considered here , as well as in the `` gluon initiated dis '' , exactly the same linear combination contributes to the cross section .",

    "thus the framework introduced in this paper , with the proper definition of gluon tmdpdfs and their qcd evolution , will be crucial in order to consistently address different processes in terms of the same hadronic quantities and properly extract their non - perturbative parameters .",

    "the bands at nnll get smaller than the ones at nll , but there is no overlap between them .",
    "this is because we have exponentiated the rapidity scale dependence of the parameter @xmath154 through the resummed @xmath184 in eq .  .",
    "this exponentiation makes the cross - section at a given resummation order contain some contributions of higher orders , and thus the nll band , in particular , is smaller . at nnll",
    "this issue is much less relevant , as will be clear below when comparing with the prediction with the resummation in impact parameter space .",
    "if we compare the two panels in figure  [ fig : xsection ] , we see that the impact of the non - perturbative contribution leads to a significant change of the distribution .",
    "however the choice @xmath256 is rather extreme , since the non - perturbative model in eq .  , which is an exponential function , induces rather large corrections to the perturbative expression in the low @xmath104 region , exactly where one would expect it to work better .",
    "thus , given that the non - perturbative parameters should probably be smaller , we conclude that the higgs boson transverse momentum distribution is not very sensitive to those parameters .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn in @xcite , where a gaussian model was used to parametrize the non - perturbative contributions , and which led to an almost negligible impact on the distribution .",
    "this is easy to understand , since the gaussian function in the low @xmath104 region is closer to 1 than the exponential function and therefore has an even smaller impact .",
    "let us now turn our attention to figure  [ fig : xsection2 ] , where we present a similar prediction to the one already discussed , but with the resummation performed in impact parameter space .",
    "we use here the same settings for the pdfs and the running of the strong coupling as in figure  [ fig : xsection ] .",
