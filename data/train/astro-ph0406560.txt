    "the narrow line regions ( nlrs ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been studied , extensively , from the ground and from space .",
    "this component of the nucleus is spatially resolved from the ground in nearby sources and _ hst _ observations extend the range to a redshift of about 0.5 .",
    "thus , detailed nlr mappings are now available for a large number of sources covering a large range of luminosity and redshift ( falcke , wilson , & simpson 1998 ; bennert et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter b02 , schmitt et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic characteristics of the nlr gas have been studied , extensively , over several decades and high quality data are now available ( e.g. , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . the main source of excitation of the nlr gas is photoionization by the the central continuum ( see review and references in netzer 1990 ) but shock excitation must be important in some parts of this region , most notably is nlrs that are associated with jet - like radio structures ( schiano 1986 ; dopita et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the gas dynamics has been studied too with detailed results concerning the profiles of various emission lines and their dependence on the level of ionization , the density and the dust content of the gas ( e.g. , veilleux 1991 ; nelson & whittle 1996 ; barth et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "a major emphasis in recent years has been the extension of such works to higher luminosity sources .",
    "some such studies suggest that the  line width is correlated with the stellar velocity distribution in the bulge and thus also with the mass of the central black hole ( nelson , 2000 ; shields et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "several recent attempts to study nlrs in large samples of agns lead to apparently conflicting results .",
    "b02 obtained narrow band hst images of seven luminous radio - quiet palomar - green ( pg ) quasars with @xmath1 .",
    "they argued , on the basis of comparison with nearby less luminous sources , that the nlr size ( radius ) scales with the  and the  line luminosities roughly as @xmath2 .",
    "the measured nlr sizes in their most luminous sources approached 10 kpc ( throughout this work we assume @xmath3 ^-1 kms@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) .",
    "this dependence has been questioned by schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who studied a much larger sample ( 22 seyfert 1 s and 38 seyfert 2 s ) , albeit with much lower luminosity , and found @xmath7 .",
    "croom et al . ( 2002 ) analyzed the spectra of @xmath8 agns from the 2df quasar redshift survey ( 2qz ) and claimed to see a decrease in the equivalent width ( ew ) of several narrow lines ( [ ] @xmath9 , [ ] @xmath10 , and [ ] @xmath11 ) with source luminosity .",
    "they suggested that at least part of this `` baldwin effect '' ( baldwin 1977 ) is due to the increase in nlr size with source luminosity which leads to galactic - scale dimensions in the most luminous objects .",
    "such nlrs are likely to escape the system leading to agns with weak or no nlr emission .",
    "testing this idea for the most intense narrow line , , was limited by the low redshift , and hence relatively low luminosity in the croom et al .",

    "the main result , which is apparent in table  [ fit ] , is that the population of high - redshift , high - luminosity quasars is divided into two distinct groups .",
    "one group ( 22 sources ) contains objects with strong  lines ( ew@xmath29 ) and with i()/i(broad ) similar to the ratio observed in many low luminosity type - i agns .",

    ", we assumed a `` typical ''  line with fwhm of 1000 ^-1 kms@xmath4  ( about the median in our sample , see below ) and looked for the weakest such feature that would have been detected in our spectra after the removal of the blends .",
    "for the best s / n spectra ( three sources ) , this translates to an ew which is approximately @xmath30ew ( ) . for the other four cases the upper limits correspond to @xmath31ew ( ) . the luminosities corresponding to these upper limits are listed in table  [ fit ] .",
    "the division into two distinct groups of very high luminosity agns is further confirmed by the dietrich et al .",

    "these authors found that two out of the six luminous @xmath32 quasars in their sample have prominent  lines while the remaining four had no trace of this line .",

    "very high luminosity sources that are also weak  emitters have been found by yuan and wills ( 2003 ) in their ir study of high redshift quasars .",
    "however , most of those objects are broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) that are known to have a weak  line . regarding intermediate luminosity agns , bg92 find that 26 out of the 87 sources in their pg quasar sample show ew()@xmath13  and 12 show ew()@xmath33 .",

    "[ discussion ] .",
    "theoretical suggestions that the nlr size should scale with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ionizing source luminosity , have been discussed in many papers ( see netzer 1990 for references prior to 1990 and dopita et al 2002 for more recent publications ) .",
    "this is based on the assumption that both the broad line region ( blr ) gas and the nlr gas are photoionized by a central source whose spectral energy distribution changes only slightly with source luminosity .",
    "spectroscopic studies show a remarkable similarity between the emission line spectrum of high and low luminosity agns .",
    "this suggests that the ionization parameter , @xmath46 ( defined here as the ratio of the lyman continuum photon density to the hydrogen number density @xmath47 ) , and the typical gas density , are basically the same in all sources . since @xmath48",
    ", we find @xmath49 .",
    "an additional assumption is that most of the  emission originates in radiation - bounded clouds , because of the fairly uniform value of i()/i(narrow ) .",
    "this allows to replace @xmath45 by the luminosity of any hydrogen recombination line , e.g. , .",
    "we note that there is a well established @xmath42 correlation for the blr gas ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) where reverberation mappings show that @xmath50 .    a real physical explanation of any @xmath42 dependence is still lacking since the mechanism controlling the gas density and location is unknown .",
    "some papers assume a stratified , radiation bounded nlr with a pre - chosen run of density and hence level of ionization ( e.g. , netzer 1990 ; komossa & schulz 1997 ) .",
    "such models are naturally normalized in incident flux units ( @xmath51 ) and can be tuned to produce the same mean @xmath46 for all sources . however",
    ", some narrow emission lines are probably produced in density bounded gas ( e.g. , binette , wilson , & storchi - bergmann 1996 ) which considerably complicate the models .",
    "it is also clear ( e.g. , alexander et al . 1999 ) that well studied nlrs contain a large range of conditions with a spread in ionization parameter and gas density .",
    "an almost orthogonal approach is provided by the `` locally optimally emitting cloud '' ( loc ) model ( ferguson et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the assumption in this case is of a large range of conditions ( density and covering factor ) at each location , where the intensities of the various lines reflect the line production efficiency at each location .",
    "this efficiency is the highest for densities that are close to the critical density of the line in question .",
    "the model provides a natural scaling of @xmath45 with  provided there is a large reservoir of gas with similar properties in all agns and on all scales . finally , there are equally complex nlr models where shock excited gas contributes significantly to the observed nlr emission ( e.g. , contini , prieto , & viegas 1998 ; schiano 1986 ; dopita and sutherland 1995 ) but no natural @xmath42 scaling .",
    "the recent papers by dopita et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and groves et al .",

    "the model suggests a natural @xmath53 dependence .",
    "it also implies that the composition and temperature of the gas are rather different from those assumed in other models because of metal depletion .",
    "the combination of the b02 observations and the recent theoretical developments point to a `` natural '' @xmath54 dependence yet raises a severe problem regarding the nlr size in high luminosity agns .",
    "any such scaling will lead , at large enough @xmath45 , to sizes that are larger than galactic sizes .",
    "the b02 results addressed here are used for normalizing this relationship , but the problem exists at high luminosity whether or not their scaling is correct . given this , we would not expect to see any strong  emitters in high luminosity sources , yet our new observations clearly show such objects .    to define the problem in a more quantitative way we plot in fig .",

    "like fig .",
    "[ o3hb_hist ] , this diagram suggest a dichotomy in the properties of the high luminosity quasars , where some sources show strong  lines and others show no or very weak such emission .",
    "there are two other ways to verify , experimentally , the b02 claim .",
    "most of our sample is at @xmath57 . at this redshift , and the chosen cosmology ,",
    "the angular diameter distance is a weak function of redshift and corresponds to about 7 kpc per arc - sec .",
    "the predicted , using the b02 relationships and our measured luminosities , corresponds to a total extent of 2 - 10 .",
    "this can be tested by spatially resolved space and ground - based observations .",
    "the 2d spectra of two of our sources ( [ hb89 ]  0329@xmath12385 , and 2qz  j222006.7@xmath12280324 ) show prominent  emission which allow such measurements ( see fig .  [ 2dspec ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "most of the line flux ( @xmath58% ) is emitted within the central four pixels corresponding to a radius of @xmath59 kpc at each source .",
    "this size is a strong upper limit since much of the flux is likely to be due to the psf ( corresponding to @xmath60  at the time of observations ) .",
    "the two upper limits on  obtained in this way are a factor of @xmath61 smaller than the radii derived from the b02 relationships .",
    "the term `` nlr radius '' used by b02 is ambiguous since those authors used very low surface brightness features to define the dimension of the  nebulosity .",
    "we used the _ hst _ archive to extract and re - analyze the b02 images .",
    "in particular , we examined the source showing the largest  nebulosity , pg  1049@xmath12005 , and remeasured its observed  image .",
    "we found that 95% of the line emission is encircled within a radius of 1.1  which corresponds to a radius of 5.5 kpc at the source .",
    "this is half of the radius deduced by b02 and suggests that the bulk of the nlr emission is emitted within a volume which is much smaller than inferred by their relationships .",
    "the different way of measuring the nebulosity is probably the main source of discrepancy in normalization ( i.e. , the nlr radius at @xmath35},42}=1 $ ] ) between the b02 and the schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) works .    in summary ,",
    "our new observations contradict the b02 results in two ways .",
    "first , about one third of the high luminosity sources show no trace of an nlr .",
    "second , there are direct indications in three cases , and sound theoretical reasons ( see below ) , to suggest that most of the nlr emission is restricted to a volume which is much smaller than inferred from the b02 relationships .",

    "a major goal of the present investigation is to test the nlr properties and the nlr spectrum in very high luminosity sources where the theoretically predicted , as well as the empirical b02 relationship , results in unreasonably large dimensions .",

    "[ rl ] ) . as for the strong  emitters , 2d spectra of two of our sources rule out the large predicted dimensions (   [ o3rnlr ] ) .",
    "moreover , our new measurements of the largest  nebula in the b02 sample are also in conflict with the b02 relationships . based on the evidence in hand",
    "we suspect that the @xmath79 dependence breaks down at some intermediate luminosity scale and that the `` true '' nlr radius , defined here as the radius encompassing 95% of the line emission , does not exceed a few kpc even in the most luminous quasars .",

    "first , the escape velocity from a spherical galaxy is roughly @xmath80 ^-1 kms@xmath4 , where @xmath81 is the mass in units of @xmath82  and @xmath83 the radial distance in units of 10 kpc .",
    "the new fwhms listed in table  [ fit ] and shown in fig",
    ".  [ fwo3_l ] , compared with the predicted , suggest therefore , dynamically unbounded nlrs .",
    "given those velocities and dimensions , the dynamical time for the most luminous  emitters , is a few @xmath84 years suggesting a short lived phenomenon . the inferred amount of ionized gas in such nlrs , given radiation bounded gas and a `` typical '' ionization parameter , is @xmath85 r_{10}^2 n_{21 } \\,\\",
    ", m_{\\odot }   \\ , , \\label{eq : mnlr}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the covering fraction and @xmath87 the column density in units of @xmath88 .",
    "simple photoionization arguments show that for strong  emitters @xmath89",
    ". this would give @xmath90  for all of our sources and @xmath91  for the most luminous  emitters .",
    "judging by the observed fwhm , most of this material is probably unbound and thus flows from the center at outflow rates approaching @xmath92 assuming a density of @xmath93 .",
    "all those numbers seem incompatible with long term mass ejection in agn - hosting galaxies .    the schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) results alleviate some of these difficulties because of the smaller size normalization and the flatter -@xmath35}}$ ] dependence . however , it is not at all clear that extrapolating their results to much higher luminosity with the suggested @xmath94 dependence ( eq .  [ schmitt ] ) is justified in view of the b02 measurements .",
    "we are facing a situation where sound physical arguments ( the narrow line spectrum , the groves et al .",
    "2004 dusty nlr model , etc . )",
    "support the expected @xmath95 relationship , yet its application to the most luminous quasars give unreasonably large sizes , masses and mass outflow rates . as explained below , the most likely explanation in our opinion",
    "is that `` typical '' nlrs ( i.e. , those similar in their properties to the ones observed in seyfert 1 galaxies ) can not last very long in high and perhaps also in intermediate luminosity agns .",
    "this means that the  emitting regions in our sample may be of a different origin and physical properties",
    ".      if compact nlrs are indeed typical of many high luminosity agns , then their properties must be very different from the properties of those nlrs observed in nearby sources .",
    "in particular , the gas density in the highest luminosity nlrs must be several orders of magnitude larger .",
    "consider for example a maximum nlr size of @xmath96 kpc and assume a similar ionization parameter in all nlrs .",
    "this would mean that the gas density in the most luminous  emitters is @xmath97 times larger than the density in nearby seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic properties must be very different too which can , in principle , be tested by accurate observations .",
    "unfortunately , present day ir spectroscopy is very limited in this respect because of the restricted wavelength bands available to ground - based observations .",
    "a possible origin of a high density gas in kpc - scale nuclear regions is violent star - forming activity .",
    "such events can produce high density , large column density , non - solar composition dusty gas .",
    "the overall spectrum of such regions is likely to differ from the spectrum of nearby , lower density nlrs . at present",
    "we can only observe   which is the strongest emission line under a variety of conditions .",
    "future , space - born spectroscopy , will be able to test this idea by looking for other emission lines .",
    "the scenario we propose to explain the observations of our high luminosity agns , and the apparent break down of the @xmath54 relationship , is of two distinct populations .",
    "one where such scaling continues to high luminosity due to radiation pressure force or other effects .",
    "this results in short - lived enormous nlrs that will show basically no nuclear narrow emission lines during most of their life .",
    "the other group is those sources where starburst or another unknown process ejects high density gas into their nuclear region .",
    "this gas is ionized and excited by the central radiation source and produces the observed strong  lines .",
    "such `` star - forming nlrs '' would have spectral properties that are rather different from those observed in nearby less luminous sources .",
    "given the similar fraction of weak  emitters in bg92 and in our new sample , we suggest that the phenomenon is of a continuous nature and starts at some intermediate luminosity .",
    "its clearest manifestation is in the highest luminosity sources such as the ones observed here .",
    "the sample used here , which combines data from various different sources , is not complete .",
    "however , it allows the best test , so far , of the bg92 /    relationship and several other suggested correlations at the high end of the agn luminosity function .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the most extreme values of /  require very high luminosity .",
    "they also suggest that higher accretion rate results in larger /  ( fig .  [ e_r_fe2 ] ) and that @xmath67 is the most important factor for determining several other correlations .",
    "there are , however , some exceptions , i.e. , sources with large @xmath67 yet small /.",
    "our work shows that the decrease of ew ( ) with increasing @xmath67 in the present sample is probably the cause for the increase of /  with the accretion rate .",
    "ew ( ) by itself does not depend on the accretion rate and it is therefore possible that the iron - to - hydrogen abundance ratio plays no role in this correlation . on the other hand , we do not have the data or a good enough theory ( e.g. , verner et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) to completely rule out the possibility that the iron abundance depends on luminosity or on the accretion rate . in a similar way , ew ( ) is _ not _ correlated with @xmath67 , but we suggest that the /   ew ( ) anti - correlation is driven by the accretion rate .",
    "sulentic et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and others argued that the general agn population should be divided into two sub - groups according to the so - called eigenvector 1 ( e1 , see bg92 ) which contains four main observables . according to this scheme , group a sources show the strongest e1 properties .",
    "most radio - loud agns belong to group b , i.e. , those with weaker e1 properties .",
    "here we are not interested in e1 as such since our sample is not complete and so is the combination of our sample with the bg92 and the sulentic et al .",
    "( 2004 ) samples .",
    "we are however in a position to look at the extreme end of the distribution in @xmath73 and in @xmath67 and test for those quantities that depend on them .",
    "we have already discussed all the relevant correlations . here",
    "we note that all those involving @xmath67 show that nls1s occupy the same part of parameter space as the high luminosity , high accretion rate agns observed by us .",
    "these sources are thus the high luminosity analogs of nls1s and should , perhaps , be referred to as narrow - line type 1 quasars ( nlq1s ) .",
    "we have discussed the near - ir spectra of 29 newly observed high - luminosity high - redshift agns and used the data to argue that previous claims for expected and observed @xmath0}}^{1/2}$ ] dependence are in conflict with the observations .",
    "about 2/3 of all very high luminosity sources show strong  lines while the remaining objects show no or very weak such line .",
    "we suggest that the nlr properties in high luminosity , strong  emitters are very different from those observed in nearby agns , and possibly imply denser than `` usual '' nlrs .",
    "the origin of the high density gas is likely to be a violent star - forming event in the nucleus .",
    "we also investigated /  and ew ( ) at the high end of the luminosity and @xmath67 in agns and showed that the first of those is probably driven by the overall accretion rate while the second is independent of source luminosity ( i.e. , no baldwin relationship ) or accretion rate .",
    "the /  ratio may be an iron abundance indicator but this can not be proven observationally because of the ew ( ) dependence on accretion rate .",
