    "one of the central questions in the study of granular flows is how to determine the relationship between the microphysics of grain interactions and the collective or macroscopic flow properties of the system . elucidating these flow properties",
    "is of fundamental importance to a variety of fields ranging from civil engineering to geophysics @xcite .",
    "moreover , this question remains at the forefront of many - body physics as its solution appears to demand entirely new concepts that are applicable to systems driven far from equilibrium .    in this article",
    "we explore the velocity field in steadily flowing granular media in the chute geometry  an inclined plane having a rough surface at its base and a free surface at the top .",
    "such flows have been previously characterized both experimentally @xcite and via simulation @xcite . in this work",
    "we address , through large - scale discrete element simulations , the change in the flow field in the material as a function of interparticle adhesion .",
    "we present a modified constitutive law relating shear stress within the bulk to the local gradients in the velocity field and discuss the implications of our proposed continuum description of the material .",
    "in addition we observe the formation of a plug flow regime in the cohesive slab extending from the free surface at the top of the slab into the bulk .",
    "the depth of this plug flow regime can be calculated from a comparison of the yield stress of the cohesive material to depth - dependent shear stress due to the weight of the slab .",
    "the study of cohesive granular media is necessary for the application of granular physics to the behavior of such materials in their geophysical context , _",
    "i.e. _ the dynamics of landslides , snow avalanches , and even the lunar regolith . in the former examples , a small aqueous wetting layer on the particles forms menisci at intergrain contacts to produce an adhesive force . in the latter case ,",
    "high - vacuum conditions facilitate close contacts between particles leading to interparticle adhesion due to van der waals interactions .",
    "the study of cohesive granular materials also helps to elucidate fundamental questions concerning the physical description of this state of matter .",
    "one aspect of granular materials that differentiates them from random elastic solids or liquids is that cohesionless granular system can not support tensile stresses . by observing the quantitative effect of known cohesive forces upon granular flows",
    ", one should be able to bridge between the better understood elastic solids and/or viscous liquids and granular materials , which , by comparison , remain rather mysterious .",
    "the change in the stress - strain relation due to internal cohesion also provides insight into the rheology of cohesionless granular matter .",
    "we discuss this further below",
    ".    in the study of granular mechanics it is clearly desirable to develop a continuum description of flow since calculating the detailed dynamics of numerous intergrain collisions rapidly becomes intractable with increasing numbers of such particles .",
    "in addition one expects , based on experience with the continuum mechanics of solids , liquids , and gases , to be able to develop a set of relations between macroscopic averaged observable such as the velocity field @xmath0 , mass density @xmath1 , and stress tensor @xmath2 within the steadily - flowing granular material where details of the grain interactions enter through a small set of parameters @xcite .",
    "such a constitutive relation between the stress state in the material and its rate of deformation taken together with momentum conservation completely determines the flow properties of the granular system assuming the boundary conditions on the flow are sufficiently well - known .",
    "there are now a number of such hydrodynamic descriptions of granular flow which seek to derive such constitutive equations from a more microscopic theory @xcite .",
    "there are a variety of such models that rely on arguments based on effective viscosities @xcite , transient force - chains@xcite or a superposition of a rate - dependent contribution arising from collisional interactions and a rate - independent part related to enduring frictional contacts among the grains@xcite .",
    "a well - known proposal by bagnold@xcite for such a constitutive relation for granular flows is that the shear stress in the flow is proportional to the instantaneous square of the rate of strain tensor and that the density is constant throughout the material . taking ( as we do throughout this work ) a coordinate system where the @xmath3-axis is directed in the flow direction and the @xmath4-axis as the upward normal to the inclined plane",
    ", the bagnold relation is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant having the dimensions of @xmath7 .",
    "one can reduce the supporting argument for eq .",
    "[ bagnold ] to dimensional analysis ; in the flowing granular system the one energy density available is the kinetic energy of the grains themselves @xmath8 .",
    "as long as the local mass density remains constant , galilean invariance requires the shear stress to be proportional to the square of the velocity difference across the sample . the further assumption that the relationship between stress and the rate of strain is local produces eq .",
    "[ bagnold ] . a simple heuristic argument to derive the scaling relation shown in eq .",
    "[ bagnold ] and attributed to bagnold is as follows : the transport in the gradient direction ( @xmath9 ) of the component of momentum parallel to the velocity direction ( @xmath10 ) occurs only through collisions between grains .",
    "the rate of those collisions depends on the average velocity difference between grains at different locations along the gradient direction @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the grain radius .",
    "the momentum transfer per collision also scales linearly with the velocity difference leads to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of a single grain .",
    "it is instructive to compare the above argument to the standard expression for the viscosity of a gas as determined by kinetic theory . in that case",
    "the rate of intermolecular collisions is controlled by the root mean square velocity of the gas molecules that is fixed by the equipartition theorem .",
    "thus the viscosity of the gas is proportional to the square root of temperature .",
    "the granular system is effectively at zero temperature so that the random particle velocities are driven themselves by the macroscopic velocity scale making the effective granular viscosity as extracted from eq .",

    "we performed discrete element simulations on a three - dimensional system of n monodisperse particles of mass @xmath14 and diameter @xmath15 on a rough base tilted an angle @xmath16 with respect to gravity .",
    "our simulations volume is a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath3 and @xmath17 directions , a rough base and an open top .",

    "the force captures the essential features of more physical adhesion scenarios and we expect that the effects of interaction cohesion as modelled here , to accurately reflect the behavior of experimentally accessible cohesive granular media .",

    "however we do find a subtle dependence of the flow rheology upon the value of @xmath58 which we explore later in this article .",
    "for the coefficent of friction , we use @xmath59 , which is typical for the types of materials we are modeling .",

    "the increase of @xmath110 with @xmath46 for all heights and angles strongly suggests that the internal cohesion is primarily responsible for the breakdown of the bagnold scaling . that the magnitude of the discrepancy between the observed flows and those derived from the bagnold hypothesis depends on the height within the slab ( @xmath110 vs.  z at fixed @xmath46 and @xmath16 ) is consistent with our hypothesis that long - lived contacts cause this discrepancy .",
    "clearly as one approaches the plug the intergrain contacts have extremely long life - times and the constitutive relation for the material most greatly deviates from the bagnold form .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that in the region directly below the plug where the gravitational shear stress is only slightly greater than the yield stress of the material that there would be the greatest density of long - lived contacts in the flowing state .",
    "thus , one would expect the greatest deviation from bagnold scaling near the plug .",
    "the data clearly support this ; for all tilt angles and cohesive energies @xmath110 increases with height in the slab . finally , as the tilt angle",

    "having higher typical velocities will now have fewer long - lived contacts and transient forces associated with brief intergrain collisions will become the more dominant momentum - transfer process in the material . thus the effective constituent law will appear to be closer to the bagnold form .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ bvsa ] that even in the limit of no cohesion there remains a significant deviation from the original bagnold constitutive law .",
    "this residual discrepancy can be well accounted for by slight interpenetratibility of the particles in the simulation .",

    "in fact , from our discussion of fig .",
    "[ bvsa ] , we would expect the largest population of long - lived contacts to be found in the upper part of the flowing region near the plug .",

    "cohesive granular materials generically form two different flow regimes : a solid region ( the plug ) extending below the free surface characterized by a vanishing shear rate of strain and a flowing region below the plug .",
    "the width of this plug region is independent on total depth of the slab but dependent on the tilt angle , cohesive energy , the mass density of the granular material and is accounted for by postulating the appearance of a finite yield stress in the material . the value of this yield stress can be reasonably determined from estimates of the mean cohesive force within the slab and the mean number of such cohesive contacts .",
    "we find that in the flowing state below the plug the velocity profile is similar to the bagnold velocity profile : @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless there remain significant discrepancies between the observed flow profile and the predicted bagnold form . in light of these deviations from the bagnold form , we suggest a modified form of the bagnold constitutive law that combines two essentially independent methods of momentum transfer in the flowing state .",
    "this modified bagnold relation accounts for the usual collisional momentum transfer between grains as well as for momentum transfer due to the cohesive forces acting through the long - term contacts between grains in the flowing state .",
    "this modified profile fits the data more closely . extracting from these fits to the data the ratio of the stress transferred via each method",
    ", we find that this ratio exhibits a few reasonable trends .",
    "the effect of the long - term contacts grow with cohesive energy and within a single slab as one approaches the plug .",
    "this ratio decreases with larger tilt angles ; faster flowing slabs should more efficiently break - up any long - lived particle clusters .    to further test this hypothesis",
    "we directly measured a contact time histogram within the flowing part of the slab .",
    "a comparison between noncohesive and cohesive systems indeed shows a larger number of long - time contacts in the cohesive system .",
    "this result qualitatively supports our hypothesis that these contacts are responsible for the breakdown of the bagnold constitutive law . to provide a true quantitative model for the modified bagnold constitutive law that we propose it is necessary to calculate from a more microscopic model the stresses transmitted by these long - lived contacts . in order to do",
    "so we must determine the spatial correlations between such contacts .",
    "these contacts may , in fact , form spatially correlated clusters or chains that span stream - lines in the flow or perhaps represent randomly distributed pairs of particles ( dimers ) that remain bound for mesoscopic periods during the flow .",
    "clearly , at a fixed density of such long - lived contacts the stress transmission due to these contacts in the former case would be significantly larger than in the latter @xcite .",
    "understanding the constitutive relation of cohesive granular materials is clearly of fundamental importance to the study of granular flows in a geophysical context as well as to the handling of granular materials in industry where small amounts of a wetting fluid create adhesion contacts between the grains .",
    "interestingly , this work suggests that studying granular flows in the presence of small amounts of cohesion allows one to break the expected bagnold scaling in a controllable and computationally efficient manner .",
    "it is clear from this work and others @xcite that the non - zero compliance of the grains leads to measurable deviations from the bagnold scaling ; the bagnold law holds in the limit of hard spheres .",
    "studying significantly less compliant grains , however , is computational difficult .",
    "the further study of cohesive granular materials both analytically and computationally should enable the exploration of granular constitutive laws for physically accessible systems that nearly , but not exactly obey the bagnold constitutive relation .",
    "bagnold scaling is derived from a constitutive relation between the shear stress and the strain rate @xmath128 where @xmath129 the steady - state cauchy equation for @xmath130 is @xmath131 therefore @xmath132 where @xmath20 is the total height of the slab . solving for @xmath102 gives the velocity profile shown in eq .",
