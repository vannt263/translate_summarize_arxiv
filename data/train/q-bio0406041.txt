    "in population genetics , one aims to model the evolution of a population , taking into account evolutionary forces such as mutation , selection , recombination , or migration , using either a stochastic formulation , to incorporate the effects of a finite population , or a deterministic formulation , to emulate the limit of infinite population size . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with a deterministic mutation  selection model for a haploid population ( or a    diploid  population without dominance ) .",
    "these types of models have been subject to investigation in various different settings , see @xcite .",
    "the questions one is typically interested in comprise mutation  selection balance , mean quantities and variances , and the mutation load , i.  e. , the dependence of the mean fitness on the mutation rates .",
    "one class of mutation  selection models are sequence space models , where , inspired by the structure of the dna , genotypes are modelled as sequences written in a two- or four - letter alphabet , where each letter stands for one of the purines adenine and guanine , or the pyrimidines cytosine and thymine ( or uracil in the case of rna sequences ) .",
    "the majority of work in this field is done for two - state models , where one state is identified with purines and the other with pyrimidines , or , alternatively , one stands for a wildtype and the other for a mutant site ; results for models that incorporate the full for - letter structure of the dna are scarce @xcite .",
    "the advantage of sequence space models is that the mutation process is straightforward to model .",
    "a drawback is , however , that the modelling of the selection process is less clear .",
    "selection comes in as different reproduction rates that are assigned to different genotypes . in nature , these are influenced by the phenotype , and the mapping from genotypes to phenotypes is highly complex , such that any feasible modelling of selection is necessarily simplistic .    due to the linear structure and limited alphabet of the dna ,",
    "sequence space models are very similar to some physical models , such as one - dimensional ising models or quantum spin chains .",
    "in fact , in an appropriate formulation , they are equivalent to these @xcite .",
    "the realization of this equivalence made the well developed methods and tools from statistical physics accessible in the population genetics context .",
    "the analogies between the physical and the biological models are however involved , as the observables and quantities of interest are slightly different in the different disciplines .",
    "one example for the transfer of knowledge from physics to biology is the derivation of a maximum principle for the population mean fitness , that finds its analog in physics in the principle of minimal free energy .",
    "this has been shown for a two - state model in @xcite , generalised to a four - state model in @xcite , and derived for a very general class of evolution models in biology in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the phenomenon of a mutation driven _",
    "error threshold_. this phenomenon is based on the antagonistic action of mutation and selection . for low mutation rates , selection dominates the population , such that its distribution is going to be clustered around the optimal sequence and thus is well localized in sequence space . at high mutation rates , on the other hand , mutation outweighs the effect of selection and the population distribution is an equidistribution in sequence space , which certainly leads to extinction . if the transition from the localised to the delocalized population distribution is very sharp and occurs in a very narrow regime of mutation rates , one speaks of an error threshold .",
    "this phenomenon is equivalent to phase transitions in physics , where the temperature takes the role of the mutation rate .",
    "the existence of error thresholds in biology has been predicted in the framework of the quasi - species model @xcite , and attracted considerable interest ever since @xcite .",
    "more recently , experimental indications for the existence of error thresholds in virus population have been reported , see for instance @xcite .",
    "existence and properties of the error thresholds depend on the model of selection .",
    "most theoretical investigations of the error threshold phenomenon are done for two - state models , the only work considering four - state models we are aware of is @xcite , and this is limited to a single fitness function .",
    "the results indicate however more involved phase diagrams than in the two - state case , warranting further investigations .",
    "the scope of this work is to investigate a four - state mutation ",
    "selection model with particular attention for the phase diagrams with a number of different fitness functions using the maximum principle for the population mean fitness from @xcite to determine the error thresholds .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , the general setup of our deterministic mutation ",
    "selection model is stated , introducing the quantities of interest .",
    "this is applied to the case of a four - state sequence space model in section 3 .",
    "section 4 introduces the major simplification of a permutation invariant fitness and presents the resulting reduction of the type space . in section 5",
    ", we recall the maximum principle from @xcite , which is applied to the investigation of error thresholds in section 6 .",
    "finally , we close with our conclusions .",
    "the mathematical setup of a deterministic mutation  selection model for a haploid population ( or a diploid one without dominance ) in time - continuous formulation is as follows .",
    "individuals are identified with genotypes , i.  e. , their fitness ( or reproduction rate ) is solely determined by the genotype and thus environmental effects are neglected .",
    "the number of genotypes is finite . in the case of sequences of a fixed length @xmath0 written in a four - letter alphabet ,",
    "there are @xmath1 different sequences and thus genotypes .",
    "the set of genotypes forms the the type space @xmath2 , which is also called sequence space in case of sequences as genotypes .",
    "the population at any time @xmath3 is described by the frequencies @xmath4 of each type @xmath5 , which are collected in the @xmath6-dimensional vector @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is the cardinality of the type space .",
    "the population is a probability distribution and normalized such that @xmath8 .",
    "evolution is modelled in a time - continuous formulation .",
    "mutation and selection are treated as two independent processes going on in parallel . in this case , the possible events are birth and death events for each type @xmath9 , and mutation events from type @xmath10 to @xmath9 , which happen with rates @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the effective reproduction rate is given by the difference of birth and death rates , @xmath14 .",
    "the reproduction rates are collected in the diagonal reproduction matrix @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the mutation rates are the entries of the mutation matrix @xmath16 .",
    "the diagonal entries of the mutation matrix are chosen such that @xmath17 is a markov generator and fulfils the condition @xmath18 .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath19 is given as the sum of reproduction and mutation matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution of the population is then given by the evolution equation @xmath21 \\bi{p}(t ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the population mean fitness , and @xmath23 is the unity matrix .    in equilibrium , @xmath24",
    ", thus this equation reduces to an eigenvalue equation of @xmath19 .",
    "all equilibrium quantities shall be denoted by omitting the argument @xmath3 .",
    "so @xmath25 is the population mean fitness in equilibrium for instance .",
    "assuming irreducibility for @xmath17 , perron - frobenius theory @xcite applies , which implies that the leading eigenvalue @xmath25 is non - degenerate , and the corresponding ( right ) eigenvector @xmath26 is strictly positive , as required for a probability distribution .",
    "similarly to the population distribution , there is another distribution that will prove important in this model , namely the _ ancestral distribution_.    schematic population : lineages symbolize individuals , colours indicate their types .",
    "colour changes mark mutation events , whereas branching lines represent births and ending lines stand for deaths .",
    "the thickness of a line at any time denotes the number of offspring of the individual at time @xmath27 . ]",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows schematically a population evolving in time in terms of a multitype branching process .",
    "the population distribution of this population at any time ( between @xmath3 and @xmath27 ) is easily accessible by counting the number of lines of each type ( colour ) at that time and normalizing it .",
    "the relative reproductive success @xmath28 of type @xmath9 at time @xmath3 with respect to @xmath27 is proportional to the number of offspring at time @xmath27 of all individuals of type @xmath9 at time @xmath3 divided by the number of type @xmath9 individuals at time @xmath3 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for infinite populations in equilibrium ( @xmath29 ) , the relative reproductive success @xmath30 is given by the left perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath19 .",
    "the ancestral distribution @xmath31 is derived by tracing back each line from @xmath27 to @xmath3 and counting it as the type it is at @xmath3 , irrespective of its type at @xmath27 .",
    "as this is a probability distribution , it has to be normalized such that @xmath32 .",
    "thus we get @xmath33 , with a suitable normalization of @xmath30 , cf .",
    "@xcite , such that in equilibrium the @xmath34 are given by both the left and right pf - eigenvectors , @xmath30 and @xmath26 .",
    "every quantity , say @xmath35 , that is assigned to each type @xmath5 can be averaged with respect to both the ancestral and population distribution .",
    "the population mean of @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 the population mean fitness from equation ( [ 1 ] ) is an important example .",
    "the ancestral mean of @xmath35 is given by @xmath37",
    "when modelling dna or rna evolution , the genotypes become sequences , that are written in a four - letter alphabet @xmath38 ( or binary sequences in a simplified version ) . here , we restrict ourselves to sequences of fixed length @xmath0 , and thus the sequence space @xmath39 is the set of all four - state sequences @xmath40 of length @xmath0 , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the only mutation process taken into account is that of single point mutations , disregarding more complex events such as multiple mutations , deletions or insertions .",
    "this is known as the _ single step mutation model _ @xcite .",
    "site independent mutation rates are assumed . with four different nucleotides",
    ", there are 12 different replacements of one by another .",
    "the rates for these are specified by the _ kimura 3st mutation scheme _",
    "@xcite , cf .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] , which uses only 3 different mutation rates , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "kimura 3st mutation scheme.,width=113 ]    common simplifications of this model are the _ jukes - cantor mutation scheme _",
    "@xcite , where all three mutation rates are the same , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the _ kimura 2 parameter model _",
    "@xcite , where @xmath48 , which takes into account only the different mutation rates for _ transitions _ , which are replacements of one of the purines ( a or g ) by the other , or of one of the pyrimidines ( c or t ) by the other , and _ transversions _ , which are replacements of a purine by a pyrimidine and vice versa .",
    "this is justified by the observation that transitions , which occur at rate @xmath49 , are found to have a far higher rate than the two types of transversions , which happen at similar rates @xmath50 and @xmath45 .",
    "a convenient measure for closeness of two sequences is the hamming distance @xmath51 @xcite , which counts the number of sites at which two sequences @xmath52 differ . in the single step mutation model ,",
    "this determines how many mutational steps away from each other the two sequences are . using the kimura 3st mutation scheme",
    ", one needs a 3-dimensional hamming distance @xmath53 , to account for the different types of mutations .",
    "the @xmath54-th entry of the hamming distance , @xmath55 simply counts the number of sites at which the sequences @xmath40 and @xmath56 differ in a way such that they can mutate into each other with rate @xmath57 .",
    "the entries of the mutation matrix are given by @xmath58      defining a reference type , which is usually ( but not necessarily ) taken to be the _ wildtype _ , i.  e. , the type with maximal fitness , we can conveniently change the alphabet @xmath38 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "this is done by assigning the zero string to the reference type , @xmath61 .",
    "the representation of any other sequence is obtained relative to the reference type . comparing a sequence @xmath40 with the wildtype @xmath62",
    ", we assign @xmath63 to @xmath40 at each site where the two sequences match ; at sites where they differ , we assign @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath66 , depending on the type of mutation ( determined by the respective mutation rate ) .    using this representation",
    "we can define the mutational distance @xmath67 as the 3-dimensional hamming distance to the wildtype , @xmath68 with @xmath69 and the total mutational distance @xmath70 .",
    "the number of wildtype sites is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the mutational distance determines how many mutational steps of each type a sequence is away from the wildtype .",
    "whereas the mutation model is well justified on the microscopic level , the picture is different for the reproduction rates .",
    "only little is known about the nature of realistic fitness functions , and any realistic fitness function would be highly complex and probably too hard to tackle analytically .",
    "usually , the choice of fitness function is determined rather by feasibility than by closeness to reality .",
    "one rather common , though often implicitly used , assumption is that of a permutation - invariant fitness function .",
    "this means that the reproduction rate of a sequence depends only on its mutational distance to the wildtype , not on the order of the sequence and implies that all sequences with the same mutational distance have the same fitness .",
    "of course this assumption is highly unrealistic , as in nature the location of a mutation ( whether it lies in a coding or non - coding region of the genome , for instance ) will certainly influence the fitness . having",
    "said that , the accumulation of many mutations with small effects on the fitness is described surprisingly well by a permutation - invariant fitness .",
    "in contrast to , for instance , magnetic systems in physics , where the interactions are rather short ranged , and therefore next - neighbour interactions seem more appropriate than permutation - invariant ones , in the genome the interactions are typically long - ranged , and therefore the permutation - invariant fitness is a natural choice .    for a permutation - invariant fitness , we can reduce the dimensions of the type space by a procedure that is known as lumping in the theory of markov chains ( @xcite , chapter vi ) .",
    "the essence here is that multiple classes are lumped together in one class , such that a new markov process with fewer classes emerges . in our case",
    "we want to lump together all sequences with the same fitness , such that the lumped types are determined by the mutational distance @xmath67 .",
    "this implies that the lumping is compatible with the mutation scheme , which imposes the structure on the type space .      the sequence space @xmath2 contains all @xmath60-sequences @xmath40 of length @xmath0 , @xmath72 , and thus @xmath73 .",
    "the neighbourhood or structure of this space is determined by the mutation model : two sequences are neighbours if and only if they can mutate into one another with a single mutational step , i.  e. they differ only at a single site .",
    "thus each sequence has @xmath74 neighbours as there are n sites and three types of mutation at each site .    the lumped type space , or _ mutational distance space _",
    "@xmath75 contains the @xmath76 different mutational distances @xmath67 .",
    "going from the original sequence space @xmath2 to the mutational distance space @xmath75 , the neighbourhood is maintained , i.  e. , those and only those sequences @xmath56 that are neighbours of a particular sequence @xmath40 are in classes @xmath77 that are neighbours of @xmath67 , the mutational distance of @xmath40 . as @xmath75 contains all possible mutational distances",
    "@xmath67 , it can be visualized as a simplex in @xmath78 .    describing the neighbourhood of the mutational distances , it is useful to classify the sites of a sequence into wildtype and mutant sites , where the wildtype sites are those denominated by @xmath63 , whereas the mutant sites are the @xmath79-sites .",
    "a mutation at a wildtype site changes this site to a mutant site and thus increases the total mutational distance @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "this is symbolised by @xmath82 these mutations occur at rate @xmath83 .    for a mutation at a mutant site",
    ", there are two possibilities .",
    "firstly , it can be a mutation from type @xmath54 back to the wildtype with rate @xmath57 and thus decrease the total mutational distance ; in this case the mutational direction is given by @xmath84 with the @xmath85 from equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "secondly , it can be a mutation to another type of mutant site , which does not change the total mutational distance @xmath80 , but changes the components of the mutational distance @xmath67 to @xmath86 with @xmath87 these mutations happen at rate @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , respectively .      as we assume that fitness is permutation invariant and we lump together all sequences with the same mutational distance , the lumped reproduction matrix @xmath91 is diagonal , too , and it is easily obtained as @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "the lumped mutation matrix @xmath94 differs more from the original @xmath17 .",
    "the only nonzero entries ( apart from the diagonal ) are the mutation rates between neighbouring mutational distances .",
    "they are given by @xmath95 with @xmath90 , taking into account the number of different sites at which the mutation can take place with the same effect . using the same diagonal entries as in @xmath17 , i.  e. , , the mutation matrix is still a markov generator .",
    "note that @xmath94 is , however , not symmetric in contrast to @xmath17 . for details of the lumping procedure ,",
    "see @xcite .    the lumped time evolution operator @xmath96 is as before given as the sum of reproduction and mutation matrix , @xmath97 . in the lumped system",
    ", the evolution equation takes the same form as before ( see equation ( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the equilibrium distribution ( or pf - eigenvector ) @xmath98 of @xmath94 is given by the number of sequences lumped into each mutational distance , @xmath99 thus @xmath100 and similarly for other mutational steps .",
    "using this , it can easily be verified that @xmath94 is reversible ( i.  e. , the detailed balance holds ) , @xmath101 and as @xmath91 is diagonal , this holds likewise for @xmath96 : @xmath102 .",
    "one of the quantities of main interest is the population mean fitness in equilibrium , @xmath25 , which is given by the leading eigenvalue of @xmath96 . in principle , this can be obtained by rayleigh s variational principle . here , this is however not useful , as the optimization would have to be carried out over a space of dimension @xmath76 . using the assumption of a permutation - invariant fitness and the lumped markov chain ,",
    "rayleigh s principle can be reduced to an optimization over a single scalar in the case of binary sequences @xcite , or over the three components of the mutational distance our case of four - state sequences @xcite .",
    "a general reduction of rayleigh s principle is derived in @xcite . here",
    ", we shall briefly repeat the derivation of the maximum principle .      due to the reversibility of @xmath94 ,",
    "the time - evolution operator @xmath96 can be symmetrized by the means of a diagonal transformation , @xmath103 using the mutational equilibrium @xmath104 . @xmath105 has the same spectrum as @xmath96 .",
    "the off - diagonal entries of @xmath105 are given by the symmetrized mutation rates @xmath106 .",
    "the symmetrized mutation rates are thus explicitly given by @xmath107 the diagonal entries of @xmath96 are unchanged by this transformation .      the next step is to split up the symmetrized time - evolution operator @xmath105 into the sum of a markov generator and a diagonal matrix that contains the remainder , @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the ( symmetric ) markov generator and @xmath110 being the ( diagonal ) remainder .",
    "clearly , the off - diagonal entries of @xmath109 are given by the symmetrized mutation rates , @xmath111 .",

    "analogously to the temperature - driven phase transition in physics , for certain choices of fitness functions one can observe the phenomenon that the order of the population breaks down at a critical mutation rate , and for any mutation rates higher than this , the population is delocalized in sequence space . in the population genetics context , this phenomenon is known as mutation - driven _",

    "the general mutation model in our setup is the kimura 3st mutation scheme , where it is accounted for one mutation rate for transitions and two mutation rates for the different types of transversions . in the analysis of the phase diagrams we focused on 2 simplifications of this model : firstly , the kimura 2 parameter model , where the two mutation rates for transversions are taken to be identical , and secondly , the jukes - cantor mutation model as a special case of the kimura 2 parameter model where all three mutation rates coincide .",

    "not all possible fitness functions give rise to error thresholds , for instance , with non - epistatic fitness functions , i.e. , functions that are linear in the mutational distance @xmath67 , there exist no error thresholds . here , we have focused on two simple examples of fitness functions that do cause error thresholds , namely ( i ) a fairly general quadratic symmetric ( with respect to the components of the mutational distance @xmath12 ) fitness function and ( ii ) a truncation selection .    for these fitness functions , error thresholds can be found for certain parameter values . it has been argued ( e.  g.  @xcite ) , that the error threshold phenomenon , which was first described for a model with single - peaked landscape , might be an artefact of this highly unrealistic fitness function .",

    ". a certain degree of complexity is however needed for error thresholds , as there are none for a linear fitness .",
    "therefore one can expect that more realistic fitness landscapes , which are more rugged and not of the permutation - invariant type , might show a rich error threshold behaviour .",
    "hence error thresholds are a phenomenon that plays a role in evolution , as supported by recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "apart from the ordered and disordered phases , which also occur in two - state models , a partially ordered phase has been observed @xcite , which differentiates only between purines and pyrimidines .",
    "this phase is directly dependent on the four - state nature of our model .",
    "however , as our analysis has shown , it is as well dependent on a certain symmetry of the fitness function , which comes naturally in the equivalent physical systems , but seems rather artificial in the biological setting , indicating that this phase , interesting though it may be , is of little significance in biology .",
