    "exploring more general physical theory beyond the standard quantum physics has great practical importance as well as pure academic interest .",
    "it can give some ( and hopefully full ) explanations why quantum physics is as it is while quantum physics is not the most general no - signaling theory  @xcite .",
    "it also provides plenty of new insights for researches in other fields , such as statistical physics , field theory , and , interestingly , even computer science .",
    "for example , it is known that certain exotic effects , such as the closed - time - like curve  @xcite , nonlinear time evolutions  @xcite , and postselections  @xcite , enable super strong computing ( such as pp ) .",
    "it was also pointed out that the fact that universal quantum computing with postselections ( postbqp ) is very strong ( i.e. , pp )  @xcite can be used to show the hardness of classical efficient simulations of some superficially innocent non - universal quantum computing models , such as depth - four circuits  @xcite , commuting gates  @xcite , non - interacting bosons  @xcite , and the one - clean qubit model ( dqc1 )  @xcite .",
    "there are several theoretical formalisms to study general physics beyond the standard quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "oreshkov , costa , and brukner  @xcite recently proposed a new framework , so called the process matrix ( pm ) framework , to study a physical theory where locally operations are described by cp maps but globally no fixed causal structure is assumed ( see also refs .",
    "since the standard quantum physics assumes the global fixed causal structure , the pm framework can describe more general physical theory beyond the standard quantum physics .",
    "in fact , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for two parties who perform measurements on each single - qubit system the pm framework can violate a  causal inequality \" , which is not violated in the theory where the global fixed causal structure exists .",
    "( see the next section . )",
    "does the pm framework always exhibit some exotic effects beyond the standard quantum physics ? or exotic effects",
    "are exceptional for some special circumstances , such as certain specific system dimension or number of parties , etc . ?",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the question . in this paper , we show that for a single - party system we can not see any exotic effect beyond the standard quantum physics : the pm framework is reduced to the standard quantum physics .",
    "it is interesting to point out that this result has an analogy in the bell inequality violation : a single - party system can be described by a local hidden variable theory , whereas more than two parties can violate the bell inequality ( or its multipartite generalizations ) .",

    "@xcite that the pm framework for two parties exhibits the exotic effect , namely , the violation of the causal inequality . let us consider the following game ( fig .",

    "a quantum state enters into alice s laboratory , and she performs a measurement on it .",
    "she sends the post - measurement state out to the laboratory .",
    "also in bob s laboratory , he performs a measurement on an entering quantum state , and sends the post - measurement state out to his laboratory .        if a fixed global causal structure exists in the outside of the laboratories , the inequality @xmath4 \\le\\frac{3}{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "this bound is called the causal inequality .",
