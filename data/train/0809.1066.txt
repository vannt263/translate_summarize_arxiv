    "in the study of the demographics of supermassive black holes , one important unresolved problem is the observational census of black holes in very late - type disk galaxies .",
    "the masses of supermassive black holes in elliptical and early - type spiral galaxies appear to be well correlated with the bulge properties of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "these correlations naturally lead to the question of whether supermassive black holes can form in disk galaxies that lack bulges , and if so , how the black hole mass in bulgeless galaxies might be related to the properties of the host .",
    "the nearest example of a bulgeless disk galaxy , m33 , does not contain a massive black hole , with an extremely tight upper limit of @xmath6 @xmath3  determined from stellar - dynamical observations and modeling @xcite .",
    "it is not yet known whether the absence of a massive black hole is a typical property of bulgeless spirals in general , however , because very few late - type disk galaxies are near enough for stellar - dynamical measurements to yield such stringent constraints on the black hole mass .",
    "it has long been recognized that many spiral galaxies contain photometrically and dynamically distinct central star - cluster nuclei , with the m33 nucleus being one of the best - studied examples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) made it possible to survey the properties of nuclear star clusters in more distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ hst _  imaging programs have demonstrated that the majority of very late - type spirals ( hubble types scd  sd ) contain compact star - cluster nuclei at or very close to their isophotal centers @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations have revealed that the nuclear clusters in late - type spirals typically have stellar velocity dispersions of @xmath7 km  s@xmath1  @xcite , effective radii of a few parsecs @xcite , and dynamical masses of @xmath8 @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the spectra also reveal composite stellar populations indicative of multiple star formation episodes , with most clusters containing a population component with an age of @xmath9 myr @xcite .",
    "the discovery of scaling relationships between nuclear cluster masses and host galaxy properties , both in spirals @xcite and in dwarf ellipticals @xcite , offers an intriguing hint of a connection between the processes that govern the growth of nuclear clusters and black holes .",
    "@xcite speculate that the formation of nuclear star clusters and massive black holes might be mutually exclusive , such that black holes are able to form only in galaxies above some critical mass . however , the only nuclear star clusters in which the presence of a massive black hole can be ruled out at any significant level are in the local group or within a few mpc .",
    "optical spectroscopic surveys have shown that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) do occur in some nuclear star clusters in nearby galaxies @xcite , so black holes and nuclear clusters can apparently coexist .",
    "evidence that black holes can occur in at least some very late - type disk galaxies comes from the detection of a small number of agns in scd and sd - type spirals .",
    "the best example is the sd galaxy ngc 4395 , which contains a seyfert 1 nucleus @xcite ; it remains the only clear identification of a broad - lined agn in a bulgeless disk galaxy .",
    "in addition , a few examples of type 2 agns in very late - type spirals have been detected recently in optical spectroscopic surveys , such as ngc 1042 @xcite and ugc 6192 @xcite . in both ngc 4395 and ngc 1042",
    "the agns occur in nuclear star clusters ( it is not known whether ugc 6192 contains a nuclear cluster ) .",
    "a recent _ spitzer _ spectroscopic observation of the sd galaxy ngc 3621 by @xcite led to the discovery of an active nucleus , based on the detection of [ ] emission lines at 14.3  and 24.3 .",
    "since photon energies greater than 95 ev are required for photoionization of ne@xmath10 to ne@xmath11 , ordinary regions are not expected to be significant sources of [ ] emission , but a hard agn continuum can easily provide the necessary ionizing photons .",
    "emission lines from a range of ionization states of neon are observable in the mid - infrared , and the relative strengths of these lines are useful as diagnostics of the ionization conditions within agn narrow - line regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the results of new photoionization models to argue that the strength of the [ ] emission in ngc 3621 can only be plausibly explained by the presence of an agn , and not by an ordinary burst of nuclear star formation .",
    "the detection of an agn in ngc 3621 is of significant interest because it is one of the few very late - type spirals known to host an active nucleus , making it an important target for further observations to constrain its black hole mass and agn energetics .",
    "@xcite note that there is no previously published optical spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 3621 suitable for emission - line classification .    in this paper",
    ", we use archival _ hst _  images to show that ngc 3621 contains a well - defined and compact nuclear star cluster .",
    "a new optical spectrum of this star cluster is used to examine the classification of the active nucleus , and to measure the stellar velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "we describe dynamical modeling of the nuclear cluster and the resulting constraints on the masses of both the cluster and the central black hole .",
    "we also examine the structure of ngc 3621 using near - infrared images from 2mass in order to search for a bulge component in this late - type galaxy . for the distance to ngc 3621",
    ", we adopt @xmath12 mpc , based on the cepheid measurements of @xcite . at this distance ,",
    "1corresponds to 32.0 pc .",
    "ngc 3621 has been observed numerous times with _ hst _ , although many of the observations were of outer fields that do not include the nucleus , taken as part of the _ hst _  key project on the cepheid distance scale @xcite .",
    "we found three sets of images that did cover the galaxy nucleus : one with wfpc2 , one with acs , and one with nicmos .",
    "the parameters for each of these observations are listed in table [ hsttable ] .",
    "the galaxy was observed with acs / wfc at two separate pointings .",
    "one acs pointing placed the nucleus on the wfc1 ccd and the other pointing placed it on the wfc2 ; at both positions , identical exposure sequences were obtained in three filters .",
    "we selected the wfc1 pointing since this image included a larger region surrounding the nucleus .",
    "the nicmos f190n exposure was taken as the continuum observation for an f187n ( paschen @xmath13 ) narrow - band image .",
    "we do not use the f187n emission - line image here .",
    "the nicmos and acs images were retrieved from the _ hst _  data archives and we use the standard pipeline - processed versions of these images . for the wfpc2 data",
    ", we use the cosmic - ray cleaned and co - added image from the wfpc2 associations archive .",
    "figure [ hstimages ] displays the central regions of the wfpc2 and nicmos images .",
    "the images show that the galaxy contains a very compact and photometrically distinct nuclear star cluster . surrounding",
    "the cluster is a smooth and nearly featureless region of radius @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 pc ) . at larger",
    "radii , dust lanes and young star clusters become more prominent in the optical images , especially in the acs f435w band .",

    "unfortunately , the nuclear star cluster is saturated in the acs / wfc f555w and f814w images , making it impossible to use these images to derive structural parameters for the cluster .",
    "the acs f435w image is not saturated , but in this blue passband the dust lanes and massive stars in the circumnuclear region are more prominent , making this band less easily suited to modeling . in the nicmos image ( with a scale of 02 pixel@xmath1 ) , the cluster is unresolved .",
    "therefore , we use the wfpc2/pc image for the galfit decomposition .",
    "wfpc2 magnitudes listed below are on the vegamag system , using a zeropoint of 22.887 for the f606w filter @xcite .    for the galfit modeling , we extracted a @xmath19 pixel@xmath20 region from the pc image , centered on the nuclear cluster .",
    "this corresponds roughly to the smooth region surrounding the cluster .",
    "a larger region would be less suitable for galfit modeling because of the increasing prominence of the dust lanes at larger distances from the nucleus .",
    "a few patches or lanes of dust are visible at the edges of this extracted image , and we created a mask image to exclude these regions from the galfit optimization .",
    "for the point - spread function ( psf ) model , we used the tiny tim package @xcite to create a psf for the wfpc2/pc camera and f606w filter , at @xmath21 oversampling . in galfit",
    ", the galaxy model is created on an oversampled grid , convolved with the psf model , and finally resampled back to the wfpc2/pc plate scale and convolved with the wfpc2 ccd charge - diffusion kernel @xcite in order to compare with the observed galaxy image .    as an initial step , we attempted to model the image as the sum of an exponential disk plus a central cluster , using a variety of possible models for the cluster based on the various functional forms available in galfit ( gaussian , moffat function , srsic function , and king model )",
    ". none could adequately represent the cluster profile ; in each case there were large systematic residuals .",
    "after much experimentation we took a different approach , modeling the cluster as a sum of several gaussian components , since a superposition of a sufficient number of gaussians can in principle be used to fit an arbitrary cluster profile .",
    "as a simplifying step , we constrained the gaussian components and exponential disk to be concentric in the galfit model , and found that we were still able to fit the cluster profile adequately with this restriction .",
    "we began with an exponential disk plus a single gaussian component and added additional gaussians until the model profile ceased to improve significantly with the addition of a further component . in our final model",
    "we use five gaussian components plus an exponential disk .",
    "we created two versions of this galfit model . in the first",
    ", the individual gaussian components were forced to be concentric and circularly symmetric ( i.e. , axis ratio @xmath22 ) .",
    "this model lends itself most easily to deprojection and dynamical modeling , but might not yield an acceptable fit to the cluster structure . in the second version ,",
    "the individual components were still set to be concentric , but we allowed each gaussian component to have arbitrary values of axis ratio and position angle .",
    "we used the iraf ` ellipse ` task to examine the radial profile of the cluster and galfit models ; this task uses the elliptical isophote fitting method described by @xcite .",
    "figure [ wfpc2radprof ] illustrates the results .",
    "we find that the two models ( symmetric and asymmetric ) have nearly identical radial profiles .",
    "the asymmetric model yields an excellent match to the cluster s ellipticity profile ( with ellipticity ranging from @xmath23 to 0.38 within the inner @xmath24 ) .",
    "although the symmetric model is obviously unable to match the ellipticity profile of the cluster , the azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profile of the symmetric model is very similar to that of the cluster itself , as seen in figure [ wfpc2radprof ] .",
    "this makes it possible to use a deprojected version of the symmetric model as a simplified , spherically - symmetric representation of the cluster structure ( see  [ dynamicalmodeling ] ) .    in the spherical model ,",
    "the individual gaussian components have fwhms of 1.8 , 4.3 , 9.9 , 20.9 , and 69.7 pixels ( with an image scale of 0045 pixel@xmath1 ) .",
    "the three narrowest components contribute the majority of the cluster s light .",
    "the broadest gaussian component from the galfit decomposition has an extent ( fwhm=69.7 pixels or 31 ) much larger than the visible size of the cluster in the wfpc2 image , and we conclude that it represents light belonging predominantly to the galaxy disk rather than to the cluster . as we show below in  [ dynamicalmodeling ] , the choice of whether to assign this component to the cluster or the disk has a very small effect on the dynamical modeling results .",
    "the next - broadest component , with fwhm=094 , has a size comparable to the wings of the cluster visible in the wfpc2 image ( as well as being similar in size to our spectroscopic aperture ) .",
    "we interpret this component as belonging to the cluster , although the distinction between cluster and disk becomes ambiguous in the outer wings of this component and there is no clear way to determine the outermost extent of the cluster .",
    "the f606w magnitudes of these five gaussian components are 17.86 , 18.29 , 17.97 , 18.09 , and 17.18 mag , respectively .",
    "if we represent the cluster by the sum of the first four gaussian components , then its half - light radius is 013 , corresponding to 4.2 pc .",
    "@xcite find that 50% of nuclear clusters in late - type spirals have @xmath25 between 2.4 and 5.0 pc , so the size of the ngc 3621 nuclear cluster is very typical for this class of objects .",
    "the exponential component in the galfit decomposition has a scale length of 23and a magnitude of @xmath26 mag , corresponding to @xmath27 mag based on an estimated color of @xmath28 mag for an sc galaxy template @xcite . since the galfit fitting",
    "was carried out over only the central @xmath29 of the galaxy , there is no reason to expect this component to be an accurate representation of the primary exponential disk of the entire galaxy , but its magnitude is surprisingly close to the galaxy s total @xmath30 magnitude of 9.5 mag as listed in the hyperleda catalog @xcite .",
    "the radial profile plot shown in figure [ wfpc2radprof ] shows that the observed ( i.e. , psf - convolved ) surface brightness falls by @xmath31 mag arcsec@xmath32  within the inner @xmath33 arcsec of the galaxy profile , where the cluster outskirts have essentially merged into the surrounding disk .",
    "such a large gradient in surface brightness over such a small radius places this object among the most solidly detected nuclear clusters , in comparison with the late - type spirals from the @xcite sample .",
    "unfortunately , the saturation in the acs f555w and f814w images precludes their use for galfit modeling or aperture photometry of the nuclear cluster .",
    "if the default acs / wfc ` gain=2 ` setting had been used for these observations , it would still have been possible to perform accurate aperture photometry on mildly saturated objects . with ` gain=2 ` , saturation of the ccd",
    "full well results in charge - bleeding onto adjacent pixels while still conserving the total countrate for the object @xcite .",
    "however , the ngc 3621 images were taken with ` gain=1 ` , which does not sample the ccd full well capacity , and in this situation the photometry of saturated objects is compromised .",
    "this leaves the acs f435w , wfpc2 f606w , and nicmos f190n observations as the only usable _ hst _  images .",
    "the nicmos image has a much coarser plate scale ( 02 pixel@xmath1 ) and a much broader psf than the optical images , and the impact of dust lanes is very different between the optical and near - infrared images , and as a result it would be very difficult to carry out galfit modeling in a consistent manner for all of these images . therefore , we fall back on a simpler strategy , in which we perform aperture photometry to measure the cluster s brightness in each image .    under the assumption that the narrowest four gaussian components from the galfit model represent the light of the cluster , 90% of the cluster",
    "s light ( in projection ) is contained within a circular aperture of radius 12 pixels , or 054 .",
    "we use this as the fiducial aperture radius for the photometric measurements , since at larger radii it becomes very difficult to distinguish between the outskirts of the cluster and the surrounding galaxy disk . for the photometry , we set the background annulus close to the cluster , in order to minimize uncertainties due to the gradient in the fairly flat light profile of the host galaxy , and we use a background region of @xmath34 .",
    "for the two optical images , we find _",
    "hst_filter magnitudes for the cluster of @xmath35 and @xmath36 mag ( both given on the vega system ) .",
    "uncertainties on these measurements are dominated by the choice of the inner and outer background radii ( rather than photon - counting statistics ) , and we estimate overall uncertainties of @xmath37 mag on each measurement based on varying the inner and outer radii of the background region over wider radial ranges . using the iraf ` synphot ` package , we can convert these _ hst _",
    "filter magnitudes to johnson @xmath38 and @xmath30 magnitudes . for a wide range of spectral shapes corresponding to s0sc galaxy templates @xcite ,",
    "the ( f606w@xmath39 ) color index is @xmath40 mag .",
    "the acs f435w filter is very close to a johnson @xmath38 passband , and ` synphot ` calculates a color index of ( f435w@xmath41)@xmath42 mag for the @xcite templates . correcting for galactic extinction based on @xmath43 mag @xcite , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 mag for the cluster , not including any correction for internal extinction within the host galaxy or the cluster itself .",
    "we carried out photometry using the same aperture and background radii on the nicmos image , but an additional aperture correction was required in order to use photometry through an aperture of the same physical size , because the nicmos nic3 psf contains significant flux at radii larger than 054 . to estimate the aperture correction",
    ", we created a galfit model of the nuclear cluster at the plate scale of the nic3 camera , using the components from the wfpc2 galfit model , and convolved the model with a nic3 psf generated by tiny tim .",
    "we then carried out aperture photometry on the simulated cluster image in an 054 aperture , and determined the aperture correction needed to correct that photometric measurement to one that would correspond to 90% of the total cluster light ( to be consistent with the optical measurements ) .",

    "of the three 2mass bands , the _ h_-band image of ngc 3621 has the best @xmath48 and image quality , and we used this image to create the primary galfit model .",

    "we created a psf model for the 2mass image using the ` psf ` task in the iraf daophot package , combining the profiles of 42 individual isolated stars from the image . the resulting psf model is well fit by a moffat function with fwhm = 289 .    to construct a galfit model of the galaxy",
    ", we started with a single exponential disk component and added additional components as needed to eliminate strong systematic residuals .",
    "a three - component model ( convolved with the psf ) proved to be the minimal model that yielded an acceptable fit , with the three components describing the primary disk , an inner disk or possible bulge component , and the nuclear cluster .",
    "we used a srsic model for the possible bulge component . with the srsic index @xmath49 left to vary freely in the fit",
    ", both @xmath49 and @xmath25 for this component converged to extremely large and unreasonable values .",
    "to better constrain the model , we carried out the fit with the srsic index @xmath49 of the inner component fixed to values 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , and the model with @xmath50 ( i.e. , an exponential profile ) yielded the lowest @xmath51 .",
    "we modeled the nuclear cluster as an unresolved source and found an acceptable fit with no strong residuals at the location of the nucleus .",
    "the 2mass image , best - fitting model , and fit residuals are shown in figure [ 2massimages ] , and the galaxy radial profile is shown in figure [ 2massradprof ] .",

    "for the inner srsic component with @xmath50 , the model yields @xmath54 ( or 307 pc ) , and @xmath55 .",
    "following the same procedures , we created psf models for the 2mass @xmath56 and @xmath57-band images , and ran galfit on the @xmath56 and @xmath57 images using the best - fitting @xmath58-band model parameters as an initial input to the fit .",
    "the fits were very similar to the @xmath58-band results , and the component magnitudes are listed in table [ 2masstable ] . as is typically the case for galfit decompositions ,",
    "the formal fitting errors returned by galfit are extremely small ( @xmath59 mag ) and only reflect the statistical uncertainties on the best - fit model .",
    "the actual uncertainties on each component magnitude are dominated by systematic errors , typically driven by real structural differences between the galaxy s light profile and the idealized galfit model ( such as overall asymmetries , dust lanes , and spiral structure ) , and are probably at least 0.1 mag .",

    "our fitting results demonstrate that the galaxy does not contain any substantial bulge component , and possibly no bulge at all . at best",
    "there is a minor plateau in the inner disk surface brightness , corresponding to the inner srsic component in the galfit fits , that might possibly be ascribed to a faint pseudobulge .",
    "the central surface brightness of this inner exponential component is 1 mag arcsec@xmath32  fainter than the surface brightness of the primary ( outer ) disk component .",
    "the inner srsic component does have some properties in common with pseudobulges .",
    "it is best fit with an exponential profile ( @xmath50 ) , which is typical for pseudobulges in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of its effective radius to the scale length of the primary disk is @xmath60 , consistent with the mean @xmath61 found by @xcite for a large sample of late - type spirals containing pseudobulges . with an absolute magnitude of @xmath62 mag ,",
    "the luminosity of the inner exponential component is within the range spanned by pseudobulges in nearby disk galaxies @xcite as well .",
    "the inner srsic component also has a smaller ellipticity than the primary disk , suggestive of a bulge - like feature ; this is also seen as the gradual increase in ellipticity with radius in the @xmath58-band radial profile ( figure [ 2massradprof ] ) . nevertheless , this component is so faint relative to the primary disk that it is uncertain whether it represents a distinct physical component of the galaxy . since its interpretation is somewhat uncertain , we take its luminosity to be an upper limit to the luminosity of a bulge or pseudobulge in ngc 3621 .",
    "deeper and higher - resolution infrared observations would still be desirable , in order to carry out a more definitive search for a faint bulge component in this galaxy .",
    "one possible concern in these model fits is that a small bulge , nearly unresolved in the 2mass images , might be subsumed within the nuclear cluster component in the model fits .",
    "however , the small size of this component makes this unlikely , because the majority of the light in the unresolved nuclear component is contained within the inner @xmath63 pixels ( 64 pc ) . still , to test for the presence of non - cluster light in the nuclear galfit component , we compared the 2mass fitting results to the small - aperture _ hst _  nicmos f190n measurement of the nuclear cluster brightness .",
    "the nicmos aperture photometry results in @xmath46 ergs cm@xmath32  s@xmath1  hz@xmath1  at 19000  . converting the nuclear cluster magnitudes from the 2mass galfit models ( @xmath64 ) to flux densities , we find @xmath65(1.65 ) @xmath66 and @xmath65(2.2 ) @xmath67 ergs cm@xmath32  s@xmath1  hz@xmath1 , in each case somewhat larger than the nicmos flux .",
    "this suggests that there may be some contribution of non - cluster light included in the nuclear cluster component in the galfit models , which would not be surprising given the coarse pixel scale of the 2mass images . still , the amount of possible `` extra '' non - cluster light in the nuclear cluster model component is well below the brightness of the inner exponential component in the galfit models , and the upper limits to the bulge luminosity described above are not affected .",
    "the stellar mass of the cluster is a quantity of primary interest .",
    "ideally , the stellar mass would be determined from _ hst _  photometry using the widest possible wavelength coverage , from the ultraviolet to near - infrared , as well as stellar population fits to spectroscopic data , in order to minimize degeneracies between age , metallicity , and reddening .",
    "in addition , the stellar population is expected to be composite , containing a wide range of stellar ages , as seen in other nuclear clusters .",
    "the accuracy of our estimates is very limited with only three photometric bands available .",
    "the lack of photometric coverage blueward of the @xmath38 band exacerbates the problem , since @xmath68-band or near - uv measurements would be needed to accurately constrain the presence of a young stellar population component in the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the available spectroscopic data ( described below ) has very low @xmath48 blueward of h@xmath69 , making it unsuitable for the sort of detailed stellar population modeling that was done by @xcite and @xcite for other nuclear clusters .",
    "to estimate the cluster s stellar mass , we used the ` kcorrect ` package ( version 1.4 ; blanton & roweis 2007 ) , which performs fits of model spectral energy distributions for composite stellar populations with varying amounts of reddening to photometric data in arbitrary filter sets .",
    "the code uses a basis set of instantaneous - burst spectra from the models of @xcite with the @xcite initial mass function , and finds the best - fitting match of the spectral templates to the photometric data using a nonnegative matrix factorization technique . to input our photometric data points into ` kcorrect ` , we correct them for galactic extinction ( @xmath70 , 0.22 , and 0.04 mag in the f435w , f606w , and f190n filters , respectively ) , and convert to ab magnitudes .",
    "the code returns a best - fitting mass - to - light ratio of 0.47 ( in solar units ) in the nicmos f190n band , and a stellar mass of @xmath71 @xmath3based on the cluster light within the 054 photometric aperture . combining the mass estimate from ` kcorrect ` with the cluster s @xmath30-band luminosity , we have a @xmath30-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "to obtain an additional estimate of the stellar mass from the photometric measurements , we applied the results of @xcite to derive a @xmath57-band mass - to - light ratio based on the optical color measured from the acs and wfpc2 images .",
    "the @xcite @xmath73 values are based on the pegase spectrophotometric evolution models @xcite , assuming an exponentially declining star - formation rate .",
    "the assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a modified salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with a smaller contribution from low - mass stars , resulting in a 30% reduction in mass relative to a salpeter imf for a given luminosity .",
    "bell et al .",
    "estimate that their @xmath73 ratios may have @xmath74 random uncertainties and @xmath75 systematic uncertainties due to dust extinction and differences in galaxy ages and star - formation histories . uncertainties in the imf are likely to contribute at least this much systematic error as well .",
    "transforming the optical photometry to johnson filters , we find @xmath76 mag for the cluster . for this color index ,",
    "the bell et al .",
    "results predict @xmath77 in solar units .",
    "applying this mass - to - light ratio to the point source component in the 2mass @xmath57-band model gives a stellar mass of @xmath78 @xmath3 .",
    "as discussed above , the comparison between nicmos and 2mass photometry of the nuclear cluster suggests that the 2mass @xmath57 magnitude might be too bright by @xmath74 due to inclusion of non - cluster light .",
    "the bell et al .",
    "prescriptions yield a @xmath30-band stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath79 , and combining this with the absolute @xmath30 magnitude determined from the wfpc2 data implies @xmath80 @xmath3 . from all of these results , our best estimate of the cluster",

    "@xmath73 calibration ) can result in systematic differences of at least a factor of 2 , and possibly more than a factor of 3 , even when the same imf is assumed . allowing for uncertainty in the imf , a systematic uncertainty of more than a factor of 4 in stellar mass is certainly plausible , particularly in view of the complex star formation history of a typical nuclear star cluster .",
    "ultimately , the main conclusion that we can draw from these results is that within the substantial uncertainties , the stellar mass derived from the _ hst _  photometry appears to be consistent with the cluster s dynamical mass ( as described below in  [ dynamicalmodeling ] ) .",

    "consequently , the background subtraction employed in the spectral extraction must be subtracting off some galaxy light with a different velocity dispersion and possibly a different mean velocity than that of the cluster itself .",
    "we tested the magnitude of this effect using the data from the esi echelle order containing mg@xmath84 and fe5270 . for this order , we added the extracted sky spectrum back into the extracted cluster spectrum , to obtain a spectrum of the cluster without sky subtraction .",
    "we then ran the velocity dispersion fitting routine on this spectrum .",

    "after subtraction of the mean background level , the remaining contribution of galaxy disk light to the esi spectrum is only 10% .",

    "figure [ bpt ] shows the location of the ngc 3621 nucleus in a line - ratio diagnostic diagram , in which it falls in the main seyfert branch of the diagram .",

    "as an initial approximation of the cluster s total mass , we use the virial theorem for a spherical , isotropic , and isolated system : @xmath106 here , @xmath107 is a dimensionless factor that depends on the density profile and velocity dispersion profile of the cluster , and @xmath89 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion averaged over the density profile of the cluster .",

    "this formalism allows us to model the structure of a star cluster with a two - component mass distribution including stars and a central point mass .",
    "similar to the virial theorem method , the total cluster mass as derived from the jeans equation depends on its outer extent .",
    "however , determining the extent of the light that is gravitationally bound to the cluster is somewhat complicated by the fact that it is embedded in a disk .",
    "particularly near the outermost radii , it is not entirely straightforward to distinguish between the light from stars bound to the cluster and the light due to the stars in the disk . in the galfit model for the cluster , 90% of the total cluster light in the multi - gaussian model",

    "we also note that the results described here refer to the mass of the nuclear cluster ; the mass contributed by the galaxy disk component within this fiducial radius is not included in the dynamical mass results quoted below . within a projected radius of 17 pc ,",

    "these gaussian components are individually deprojected by abel transformations , and the resulting @xmath120 is the sum of these four deprojected functions .    to compare to the measured velocity dispersion of the cluster we integrate along the line of sight through the cluster : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the projected radius on the plane of the sky and @xmath124 is the surface brightness at @xmath123 .",

    "given the multi - component light distribution determined from galfit , equations  [ eq : jeans ] and  [ eq : sigmalos ] can not be solved analytically , so to obtain @xmath125 we first numerically integrate the jeans equation to obtain @xmath126 , and then integrate this solution along the line of sight using equation  [ eq : sigmalos ] to obtain @xmath127 .    finally , to obtain the integrated line - of - sight velocity dispersion for comparison with the observed value , we average the line - of - sight velocity dispersion over the cluster , weighted by surface brightness : @xmath128    in the form above , the jeans equation assumes spherical symmetry ; given the small observed ellipticity of the light distribution of the cluster , as well as the fact that the circularly symmetric galfit model fits the cluster s radial profile well overall , this provides a good approximation to the dynamical mass .",
    "further , this approach assumes that the cluster is non - rotating .",
    "though the data do not give us any information on the rotation of this cluster , the small ellipticity can be interpreted as a small amount of flattening of the cluster due to rotation .",
    "we model the mass distribution , @xmath119 , in terms of a component proportional to the stellar luminosity profile ( assuming a spatially uniform stellar mass - to - light ratio ) and a component representing the central point mass .",

    "as noted by @xcite , an upper limit to @xmath129  can be determined by modeling the cluster in the limit that the stellar @xmath73 approaches zero .",
    "since the cluster s mass and radius imply a half - mass relaxation time of order @xmath31 gyr @xcite , and the cluster probably contains significant population components younger than this , the cluster may not be relaxed and it could have an anisotropic velocity dispersion . when scanning the parameter space , we fix the velocity anisotropy and assume it to be constant throughout the cluster .",
    "to explore the possible effects of anisotropy , we calculate models for three fixed values of the @xmath69 parameter , @xmath130 , and 0.5 .",
    "the values @xmath131 and 0.5 correspond to ratios of tangential - to - radial velocity dispersions of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .    in figure",

    "since we are averaging the velocity dispersion over the entire surface area of the cluster as in equation  [ eq : avg ] , this result turns out to be nearly independent of velocity anisotropy .",
    "we also find that , in the limit that @xmath137 , the stellar mass - to - light ratio is @xmath138 , again independent of the velocity anisotropy .    in figure  [ massvsmbh ]",
    ", we show the two - dimensional parameter space of black hole mass and integrated stellar mass within 17 pc . in the limit that @xmath139 , the stellar mass within 17 pc is constrained to be within @xmath140 @xmath3 .",
    "this derived total stellar mass is on the larger end of the distribution of those measured by @xcite , due to the relatively high stellar velocity dispersion measured for ngc 3621 .",
    "we also note that this result implies a value of @xmath141 for the numerical factor in the virial theorem mass estimate ( equation [ eq : virial ] ) .",
    "we also computed a set of models in which the outermost gaussian component from the wfpc2 galfit decomposition ( with fwhm = 31 or 99.2 pc ) was assumed to belong to the cluster rather than to the galaxy disk , to assess the impact that this choice has on the model results .",
    "the difference proved to be insignificant , because the width of this component is so large that only a small fraction of its mass lies within our fiducial 17 pc radius for the dynamical mass calculation . in the limit of @xmath142 , the dynamical mass for the cluster changed by @xmath143",
    "when the outermost gaussian component was included as part of the cluster .",
    "similarly , the upper limit to @xmath129is unchanged if this component is added to the cluster model , and the error contours in figures [ mlvsmbh ] and [ massvsmbh ] are essentially unaffected by this change .",
    "it bears repeating that in our mass estimates we assume that there is no rotational component contributing to the measured velocity dispersion . as argued above",
    ", this is a plausible assumption , although it is at this time not possible to determine what fraction of the observed velocity dispersion comes from ordered rotational motion .",
    "any rotational motion will affect the above mass estimates , though determining by how much requires a full rotational model of the cluster , which depends not only on the rotational speed but also the inclination and eccentricity of the cluster .",
    "if the cluster were rapidly rotating _ and _ oriented with its rotation axis close to our line of sight , then our method would underestimate the true mass of the cluster and underestimate the upper limit to @xmath129 . with the data currently available , it is not possible to resolve the internal kinematics of the cluster or to constrain the cluster s rotation , or to measure the rotation speed or dispersion of the inner disk in the neighborhood of the cluster .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the cluster would be rotating in a nearly face - on orientation , since the host galaxy as a whole has an inclination of @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution kinematic study of the nuclear cluster in the edge - on galaxy ngc 4244 by @xcite demonstrates that rotation can be dynamically important in nuclear clusters , and similar observations of the ngc 3621 cluster will be important for refining the cluster mass estimate .",
    "@xcite has shown that a lower limit to the mass of a cluster can be derived from the virial theorem , based on the extreme limiting case in which all of the mass is contained at the central point of the cluster .",
    "this minimum mass is given by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the harmonic mean radius of stars in the cluster and @xmath147  is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion . averaged over the three - dimensional , de - projected light distribution , @xmath148 pc@xmath1 , and the resulting lower limit to the cluster s dynamical mass is @xmath149 m@xmath150 .",
    "this limit corresponds to our jeans equation model for a cluster in which all of the mass is in the central point source , and the masses derived by these two methods turn out to be nearly identical .",
    "we interpret this in the following way .",
    "the minimum possible total mass of the cluster is found for the limit in which all of the mass is in a central point , whether calculated by the virial theorem or by more detailed jeans equation modeling .",
    "as our jeans equation modeling demonstrates , the lower limit to the mass of the cluster overall is the same as the upper limit to the mass of a black hole in the cluster .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath151 may be useful as a simple virial estimator of the maximum possible mass of a black hole in a star cluster .",
    "this could prove useful as a shortcut for deriving upper limits to black hole masses in larger surveys of nuclear clusters , and the limit derived in this way is substantially smaller than the total cluster mass derived from equation [ eq : virial ] .    in principle ,",

    "the upper limit for ngc 3621 falls well above the @xmath170  relation extrapolated to low @xmath172 .",
    "some studies of the low - mass end of the @xmath170  relation have suggested a possible flattening in slope at the low - mass end @xcite , and it is important to test these claims with new dynamical measurements of black hole masses in low - dispersion galaxies , but our results do not provide any strong new constraints on the @xmath170  slope .",
    "the upper limit to @xmath129  in ngc 1042 also lies considerably above the @xmath170  relation , but we note that this upper limit ( from shields et al .",
    "2008 ) is simply the total dynamical mass of the cluster from walcher et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , which is dominated by the stars in the cluster .",
    "the upper limit could be considerably tightened by calculating dynamical models with a central point mass in addition to an extended stellar component , as described above .",
    "similarly , it would be interesting to compute upper limits based on this technique for all of the objects having stellar velocity dispersion measurements from @xcite , even for nuclear clusters that do not contain agns , since the more stringent upper limits that could be derived from this analysis could provide important new constraints on black hole demographics in late - type spirals .    with just a few nearby examples of very late - type spirals that are known to host agns , and just one object ( m33 ) in which a massive black hole can be essentially ruled out , we have only a very incomplete picture of black hole demographics in late - type spirals .",
    "an important motivation for improving the black hole census in low - mass galaxies with small velocity dispersions is that the @xmath170  relation and black hole occupation fraction together encode key information about the mass scale of black hole seeds and the efficiency of seed formation , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "scenarios in which black holes begin as massive ( @xmath173 @xmath3 ) seeds formed by collapse of low angular momentum gas at high redshift @xcite generally lead to low black hole occupation fractions in galaxies with small velocity dispersions . on the other hand ,",
    "if black hole seeds are formed from the remnants of population iii stars and have masses of @xmath174 @xmath3 , then the merger tree calculations described by @xcite predict high black hole occupation fractions in low - mass galaxies , but a steep slope for the lower end of the @xmath170relation , with some galaxies hosting very tiny ( @xmath175 @xmath3 ) black holes .",
    "while these models still do not incorporate all of the relevant physical processes involved in black hole growth ( such as gravity - wave recoil kicks ) , it is becoming clear that a full census of black holes in dwarf and late - type galaxies can be a fundamentally important diagnostic of the mass scale of black hole seeds at high redshift .",
    "much progress can be made through a combination of multiwavelength agn surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and improved stellar - dynamical searches for low - mass black holes , although a full census of the black hole content in low - mass galaxies is very far from being feasible at present .",
    "another possibility is that black holes in galaxies such as ngc 3621 might have formed at a later evolutionary stage , within the nuclear clusters themselves .",
    "the high densities of nuclear star clusters , as well as the likelihood of ongoing gas inflow from the host galaxy disk @xcite , offer suggestions that nuclear clusters could be favorable environments for the formation and early growth of massive black holes . in sufficiently dense young star clusters with short dynamical friction timescales ,",
    "intermediate - mass black holes could be formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in the cluster core @xcite .",
    "this process is , however , unlikely to operate within typical nuclear star clusters in disk galaxies .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the estimated dynamical friction timescale for a 100 @xmath3  star to sink to the center of a nuclear cluster is longer than the star s lifetime , and as a result the runaway process described by @xcite would not occur .",
    "the same is true of ngc 3621 ; from equation 1 of @xcite we estimate a dynamical friction timescale of @xmath15 myr for a 100 @xmath3  star to sink to the cluster center , which is much longer than the lifetime of such a massive star .",
    "still , more extreme conditions might occur during the early history of nuclear cluster formation , and the question of whether young nuclear star clusters might be favorable sites for black hole formation deserves further theoretical consideration .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "1 .   ngc 3621 has a seyfert 2 optical spectrum , consistent with the agn identification based on its mid - infrared spectrum by @xcite .",
    "this adds further support for the hypothesis that a black hole is present .",
    "2 .   for the nuclear star cluster",
    ", we find an effective radius of @xmath176 pc , a line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath0 km  s@xmath1 , and an absolute magnitude of @xmath177 mag ( uncorrected for internal extinction ) .",
    "simple estimates based on the available _ hst _  photometry suggest a stellar mass of @xmath178 @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   from two - dimensional image decomposition of 2mass images , we find that the galaxy is dominated by an exponential disk , with at most a very faint possible pseudobulge component being present .",
    "we derive an upper limit of @xmath179 mag to the luminosity of any bulge or pseudobulge component .",
    "4 .   from stellar - dynamical modeling of the nuclear cluster",
    ", we find an upper limit to the black hole mass of @xmath180 .",
    "this result is insensitive to possible velocity anisotropy within the cluster .",
    "the upper limit is based on the extreme assumption of @xmath181 for the stellar population . with improved photometric and spectroscopic observations it would be possible to better constrain the stellar mass - to - light ratio and reduce the upper limit on @xmath129 .",
    "assuming that the cluster s black hole mass is small in comparison with its stellar mass , the dynamical models give a stellar mass of @xmath4 @xmath3  for the cluster .",
    "these results add to the emerging body of evidence that some late - type , bulgeless galaxies do contain low - mass central black holes , and that black holes can be found inside some nuclear star clusters .",
    "it remains the case , however , that there are only a few late - type spirals in which a the presence of a massive black hole has been either confirmed ( based on nuclear activity ) or ruled out ( from dynamical modeling ) .",
    "further observations of the ngc 3621 nuclear cluster will lead to a more complete picture of the properties of this object .",
    "the most pressing observational need is for x - ray observations , to provide more definitive confirmation of the agn interpretation and a better estimate of the agn luminosity .",
    "improved measurements of the stellar content of the nuclear cluster can be obtained from high - resolution , high - s / n spectra extending farther to the blue than our esi data , in addition to improved multi - band _ hst _  imaging covering the near - ultraviolet to near - infrared .",
    "future extremely large ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics may make it possible to spatially resolve the kinematic substructure of the nuclear cluster , and this could lead to dramatically improved constraints on the black hole mass .",
