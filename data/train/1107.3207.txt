    "the nucleus - nucleus collisions at top rhic energy produced an initial hot and dense matter ( quark - gluon mater , qgm ) and has been interpreted as a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite .",
    "this is nearly a perfect liquid composed of quarks , antiquarks , and gluons bur is not a free gas - like quark - gluon plasma ( fqgp ) expected by theorists and experimentalists long time ago .",
    "we have proposed physical conjectures to theoretically explore the property differences among the qgm formed in pp and/or nucleus - nucleus collisions at ultra - relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "these conjectures are : ( 1 ) the fraction of gluon in yield and momentum increases with increasing reaction energy .",
    "( 2 ) the quark flavors ( @xmath7 ) approach equilibrium with increasing reaction energy . ( 3 ) the antiparton to parton ( @xmath7 quarks ) ratio increases with increasing reaction energy . in short , the population of @xmath8 quarks and the antiquark to quark ratio approach equilibrium ( balance ) and unity with increasing reaction energy , respectively .",
    "recently star reported the observation of  an equilibrium in coordinate and momentum space populations of up , down , and strange quarks and antiquarks \" by  the measured yields of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are similar \" or by the observation of @xmath13 is close to @xmath14 in au+au collisions at top rhic energy @xcite .",
    "whether this star observation means the initial fireball created in this collision is really a fqgp may be debated .",
    "the investigation of anti - nuclei has great meaning in the nuclear and particle physics , the astrophysics , and even in the cosmology .",
    "recently alice published their preliminary results of @xmath2 production in pp collisions at @xmath15= 7 tev @xcite at nearly ten months later than star publishing their measurements for @xmath5 production in au+au collisions at @xmath16=200 gev @xcite .",
    "however , because of quite low multiplicity , the study of anti - nuclei production is very hard both in experiment and theory .",
    "so far the report about the formation of qgm in early stage of pp collisions at rhic energy is still absent in our knowledge .",
    "however , there were studies about the measurable of flow parameters and the elliptic flow signature of the qgp phase transition in high multiplicity ( energy ) pp collisions @xcite .",
    "so one could not rule out the qgm formation possibility in pp collisions at lhc or higher energies @xcite .    in this paper the pythia model @xcite and paciae model @xcite",
    "were used to calculate the final hadronic state in non - single diffractive ( nsd ) pp collisions at @xmath15=7 and 14 tev .",
    "that was followed by the calculations for the production of light anti - nuclei in the dynamically constrained coalescence model based on the phase space quantization and classical limit method .",
    "the paciae model calculated @xmath2 yield of 6.247@xmath3 in nsd pp collisions at @xmath0=7 tev is well comparing with the alice rough datum of 5.456@xmath3 .",
    "this may indicate the reliability of the proposed method in some extent .",
    "the parton and hadron rescattering effects were analyzed by comparing the paciae results with the pythia one .",
    "it turned out that their role is un - negligible .",
    "pythia is a model for high energy hadron - hadron ( @xmath17 ) collisions @xcite .",
    "the parton and hadron cascade model , paciae @xcite , is based on pythia . in the pythia model",
    "a hh collision is decomposed into parton - parton collisions .",
    "the hard parton - parton collision is described by lowest leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) parton - parton interactions with the modification of parton distribution function in a hadron .",
    "the soft parton - parton collision , non - perturbative phenomenon , is considered empirically .",
    "the initial- and final - state qcd radiations and multiparton interactions are considered .",
    "so the consequence of a @xmath17 collision is a partonic multijet state composed of di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) , quarks ( antiquarks ) , and gluons , besides a few hadronic remnants .",
    "it is then followed by the string construction and fragmentation , one obtains a hadronic final state for a @xmath17 ( pp ) collision eventually",
    ".    for the pp collisions the paciae model is different from the pythia in follows :    1 .",
    "the string fragmentation is switched - off and the di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) are broken randomly into quarks ( antiquarks ) . so the consequence of a pp collision is a initial state of quarks , antiquarks , and gluons , besides a few hadronic remnants .",
    "this partonic initial state is regarded as the hot qcd matter ( qgm ) formed in the relativistic pp collisions .",
    "the parton rescattering is introduced . in this stage",
    "the rescattering among partons in qgm is considered by the 2 @xmath18 2 lo - pqcd parton - parton interaction cross sections @xcite . however",
    ", a @xmath19 factor is introduced to consider the higher order and non - perturbative corrections .",
    "the effective strong coupling constant is assumed to be @xmath20=0.47 .",
    "a parton colour screen mass @xmath21=0.63 gev is introduced to avoid the divergence .",
    "integrate the differential cross sections above , the total cross section of the parton collision is obtained .",
    "then the parton rescattering is simulated by the monte carlo method .",
    "the hadronization is proceeded after parton rescattering .",
    "the partonic matter can be hadronized by the lund string fragmentation regime @xcite and/or phenomenological coalescence model @xcite .",
    "4 .   at last",
    "the hadron rescattering is added . in this stage",
    "the hadronic matter after hadronization suffers rescattering .",
    "it is dealt with by the usual two - body collision method @xcite , until the hadronic freeze - out ( the hh collision pair is exhausted ) .    in short ,",
    "the paciae model consists of the parton initialization , parton evolution ( rescattering ) , hadronization , and hadron evolution ( rescattering ) four stages .",
    "star @xcite has found in au+au collisions at top rhic energy that  the measured @xmath22 and @xmath23 ratios are consistent with the interpretation that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are formed by coalescence of ( @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 ) , respectively . \"",
    "obviously , this simplest coalescence assumption is utilized only for ratio and not for yield .    in the theoretical studies ,",
    "the yield of light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) was always calculated in two steps : in the first step the nucleons and hyperons were calculated by transport model .",
    "then the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) were calculated by the analytical coalescence model @xcite and/or the statistical model @xcite .",
    "this meant the formation of nuclei ( hypernuclei ) was not dynamically treated continuously but as a final state interaction separately .",
    "the above analytical coalescence model relies upon the wigner function @xcite constructed according to the assumed wave function of light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) @xcite .",
    "the statistical model relies upon the equilibrium and temperature assumptions as well as the restriction on projectile - like fragment in the intermediate energy heavy ion collisions . in this paper",
    "we proposed a dynamically constrained coalescence model based on the phase space quantization and classical limit method to calculate the yield of light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) after the transport model simulation directly .",
    "one knew in statistical mechanics @xcite that , for a system with three dimensions in the state definition the set of microscopic states held in a volume element @xmath28 corresponds , in the limit of @xmath29 , to a set of @xmath30 quantum states .",
    "of course , this correspondence is an approximation as long as @xmath31 remains finite . in the eq .",
    "[ phas ] @xmath28 reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for the three position and three momentum , respectively . in other word ,",
    "a @xmath35 volume element in the three dimensions phase space corresponds to a state of the system .",
    "taking the system of @xmath5 as an example , a configuration consists of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in a single event of the final hadronic state from transport model simulation could be expressed as @xmath39 where subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 were a shorthand for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively and @xmath40 refers to the distance between @xmath36 and the center - of - mass of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , for instance .",

    "the total yield of @xmath5 in a single event is the sum of above partial yield first over the eq .",
    "[ conf ] type configurations and then over the configuration types obtained by the combination among subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
