    "<S> the ground state of the two - dimensional electron systems in bernal bilayer and abc - stacked multilayer graphenes in the presence of a strong magnetic field is investigated with the hartree - fock approximation . </S>",
    "<S> phase diagrams of the systems are obtained , focusing on charge density wave states including states with vortices of valley pseudospins ( called a skyrme crystal ) . the single - electron states in these stacked graphenes </S>",
    "<S> are given by two - component wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> that of the first excited landau level has the same component as the lowest landau level of the ordinary two - dimensional electrons . because of this </S>",
    "<S> localized wave functions , the skyrme crystal has low energy in this first excited level up to four layers of graphene , when the inter - layer distance is assumed to be infinitesimal . at the same time , bubble crystals are suppressed , so the phase diagram is different from that of a single - layer graphene . </S>"
