    "interactions and merging of galaxies must be considered major drivers of galaxy evolution ( morphology , spectral evolution , gas - dynamics , high - energy processes , agn formation ) .",
    "a merger sequence for the formation of elliptical galaxies from interacting spirals was first proposed by toomre  ( 1977 ) based on numerical simulations .",
    "inclusion of gas dynamics and star formation using tree - sph codes is now state of the art(cf .",
    "mihos & hernquist 1996 ) and allows a variety of predictions for the induced star formation and dynamical phenomena to be compared with observations . in sect.2 one of these systems ,",
    "ngc  6240 , is discussed in detail with respect to spatial structure , x - ray emission , optical colors , fir- , and h@xmath0 emission .",
    "then we discuss the x - ray properties and x - ray evolution of a sample representing interacting and merging systems along the merger sequence and we look for systematic changes of the luminosities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the contribution of extended x - ray emission along that sequence .",
    "this system is in the stage of violent merging from the evidence of its extreme fir luminosity ( soifer et al .",
    "1984 ) and peculiar morphology in the optical ( vorontsov  velyaminov 1977 ) ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ,",
    "this paper ) .",
    "further evidence for its merger interpretation has been provided by the detection of two centrally located nuclei separated in i and r images by 18 ( fried & schulz 1983 ) and with a relative velocity of 150  @xmath4 ( fried & ulrich 1985 ) .",
    "the double nucleus of this violent merger is also clearly seen on a filtered b - band image ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "evidence for shocked gas in the region between either nucleus has been provided by the detection of strong h@xmath5 2.12@xmath6 m emission ( van der werf  1993 ) which is consistent with the liner nature diagnosed from the optical spectrum ( fosbury & wall 1979 ) .",
    "the merging in ngc  6240 is accompanied by a strong nuclear starburst particularly showing up in the @xmath7 vibrational absorption features arising from a substantial population of red supergiants ( rieke  1985 , lester 1988 , van der werf et al .",
    "1993 ) .    the morphologically complex 2  emission pattern of ngc  6240 with loops extending out to 60  kpc and a total luminosity of @xmath8   ( heckman  1987 ) witnesses a starburst  driven galactic superwind . on smaller scales",
    "( @xmath9 kpc ) effects of these strong gas motions , symmetrically to the nuclei , are seen in maps of the h@xmath0equivalent width ( fig .",
    "3,left ) . in this region enhanced emission from ionized gas",

    "b map ( fig .",

    "pspc maps ( fricke & papaderos 1996 ) reveal a nuclear source accompanied by a very extended ( 2 ) and one - sided soft source towards the west very closely following the h@xmath0 maps of heckman et al .",
    "( 1987 , see above ) .",
    "the soft ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) emission of ngc  6240 can be described by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with a temperature kt=(0.8@xmath10 ) kev and an intrinsic absorbing column density of ( 1.1@xmath11)@xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the same model yields an intrinsic luminosity of ( 3.1@xmath14)@xmath15 .",
    "integration of radial intensity profiles of the pspc - data yield a @xmath16% contribution of the extended emission to the 0.12.4 kev luminosity of the source .",
    "furthermore , the extended nature of the x - ray emission in ngc  6240 is evident from the hri - map superposed on the r  band image ( fig.1,middle ) .",
    "in the right panel of the same figure the intensity distribution of the extended hri emission reaching out to @xmath17  is compared to the point response function ( prf ) of the hri and to the h@xmath0 intensity distribution .",
    "( 16.8,5.5 ) ( 12,0 )    the extended emission of @xmath18   ( 40% of the total soft x - ray emission ) can naturally be explained by a starburst wind ism / halo interaction .",
    "decomposition of surface brightness profiles ( cf .",
    "2 ) yields an absolute b - magnitude of 21.2 mag for the starburst component of ngc  6240 . with this luminosity , from the models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) , and adopting a burst duration of @xmath19 myr",
    "we obtain a _ mechanical _ energy output from the starburst of @xmath20 . the suchkov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) starburst wind model invoking a shocked ism / halo then allows to account for the 40% diffuse x - ray emission inferred above .    (",
    "8,4 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 4.5,0 )    this starburst interpretation of the extended x - ray emission in ngc  6240 is not to be confused with the situation at higher energies .",
    "asca - observations ( iwasawa & comastri 1998 ) indicate that for an energy @xmath21 kev the x - ray emission of ngc  6240 is dominated by reflection of photons from a hidden agn obscured by at least a @xmath22 @xmath13 column density of molecular gas .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence from the b ",
    "r map ( fig .",
    "3,right ) and the b ",
    "r profile ( fig .",
    "2 ) of steadily increasing colours towards the nuclear region .",
    "recently a first attempt has been made to discuss hri and pspc data for an _ evolutionary sample _ of 8 interacting / merging galaxies along essentially the toomre(1977 ) merging sequence ( read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "we discuss here a more extended sample of 22 interacting systems representing widely different dynamical stages , ranging from weak gravitational interactions through close encounters to completely merged systems .",
    "included in this sample are the two objects ngc  2623 and am  1146 - 270 from read & ponman ( 1998 ) and the objects arp  284 , ngc  7252 and ngc  6240 , thoroughly discussed by us elsewhere ( papaderos & fricke 1998 , fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben et al .",
    "1998 , this paper ) .",
    "besides the x - ray luminosities @xmath1 , we determined from surface photometry of pspc - maps the ratios of extended to pointlike emission , e / p .",
    "a tight correspondence is found between  and  ( fig.4a ) and , less pronounced , for  vs.  ( fig.4b ) .",
    "( 16.8,7 )    such relations support the view that the enhanced x - ray emission in merging systems is closely linked to the strength of the induced starburst activity .",
    "the development of extended emission , with the e / p - ratio being typically @xmath23 , seems to be a common feature of all mergers .",
    "no evidence for a relation between e / p and  is observed ( fig.4c ) .",
    "( 7,20 ) ( 1,15.2 ) ( 1,10.1 ) ( 1,5.1 ) ( 1,-0.1 )    we arranged our 22 objects tentatively along a qualitative merger sequence mainly being guided by the interaction strength and morphology of the systems ( distances , disturbances , tails , bridges , brightness profiles ) . in fig .",
    "4d we plot  and  along this sequence .",
    "three phases can be roughly distinguished . on the l.h.s",
    "are located the early , detached systems like arp  284 which experience a first interaction - induced starburst while the r.h.s is populated by the advanced mergers with strong nuclear starbursts , like ngc  6240 .",
    "the intermediate portion represents those systems which are just starting the merging process like the antennae ( ngc  4038/39 ) .",
    "the strong decline in the fir- and x - ray luminosity on the right end represents the post merger stage and the transition of the merger into an elliptical galaxy as seen in ngc  7252 .",
    "+ observations of systems populating the intermediate phase show an increasing pile - up of obscuring material ( mainly molecular gas ) enshrouding the starburst region . in this phase",
    "the fir luminosity starts to rise until dominating the bolometric luminosity for objects beyond ngc  6240 on the sequence .",
    "the evolution of individual systems along this sequence may strongly depend on the intrinsic properties of the colliding galaxies as has been shown in dissipative numerical simulations by mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ; cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "10 ) : the disk / halo systems suffer their main burst early in the encounter and hardly burst again , while the disk / bulge / halo systems manage to retain their gas almost until complete merging , in order then to suffer a strong , short - lived burst much later than the bulgeless systems . for the merged systems it is difficult to verify a posteriori whether the original interaction partners were bulge systems or not .",
    "these important parameters are not directly known .",
    "dissipative numerical simulations with very high particle numbers may help here .",
    "furthermore , it is not well understood , how the formation of non - thermal activity ( agns ) fits into the merger sequence .",
    "the sample investigated here shows the occurrence of agns in all major phases of the sequence .",
    "also here very high - resolution gas / star numerical simulations are required to investigate the inflow conditions at the centers of interacting / merging systems .",
    "+ the extended x - ray contribution e / p does not show any conspicuous evolution along the merger sequence .",
    "this extended component is in all phases related to the starburst activity and the shock - heating of the ambient gas by starburst winds .",
    "this mechanism is certainly not responsible for the extended x - ray emission observed in the halos of elliptical galaxies ( fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "in fact , in the young merger remnant ngc  7252 an extended x - ray halo is not yet present .    around such systems",
    ", however , ample mechanical energy is stored in the gravitationally bound tidal material . during the ensuing passive evolution",
    "this material will fall back onto the main body of the remnant and will thereby form an extended x - ray halo as seen in ellipticals within a couple of gyrs .",
    "model calculations for this process will be important ( cf .",
    "hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "+ the example of arp  284 ( papaderos & fricke 1998 ) may indicate that off - nuclear x - ray sources may form quite early during interactions in the shocked -gas . such sources will later - on be smeared out and may contribute to halo formation at a stage prior to completed merging .",
    "more examples of this type should be found .",
    "+ understanding of the merger sequence , e.g. the evolution of global parameters like the luminosities in different energy bands and the morphology of extended emission in successive stages of merging is still in a rudimentary state .",
    "the complexity , in particular regarding the generation of x - rays , is enormous as seen from the detailed results for individual objects ( cf . papaderos & fricke 1998 , fritze , read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "however , first patterns seem to emerge .",
    "we thank w.  pietsch and k.  bischoff for observing an u - band frame of ngc  6240 .",
    "p.  papaderos thanks k.  bischoff for assistance during observations at calar alto .",
