    "after two decades of investigations the dynamics of growing interfaces continues to be a subject of enormous interest , providing a framework to compare experiments , simulations and theory , let alone the wide range of applications encountered @xcite . despite the vast diversity of morphologies in which growing surfaces can evolve ,",
    "most numerical analysis and theoretical studies pointed out the onset of scaling regimes emerging at both large time and length scales .",
    "this enabled a classification of apparently dissimilar processes in terms of universality classes characterized by a set of scaling exponents which dominate the late evolution stages @xcite .",
    "a common feature associated with these processes is the possible emergence of rather slow temporal crossovers in which the early dynamics exhibits quite different roughening characteristics from those observed in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "the presence of growth rate inhomogeneities or growth defects localized within small spatial regions of the substrate plane ( columnar defects ) , is one of the simplest mechanisms whereby such crossovers can be observed @xcite .",
    "another possibility is realized by anchoring conditions through which nonequilibrium fluctuations are completely suppressed at the interface boundaries @xcite . the main interest in those situations is in the morphological phase transitions that may occur at large times . in this work",
    "we investigate the change of scaling regimes accompanying these transitions by means of a prototype restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) growth model @xcite combining both of these mechanisms in one dimension .",
    "as we shall see , anchored boundaries are essential for the appearance of equilibrium regimes which in turn allow for a simple calculation of roughening exponents at late stages .    at the phenomenological level of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite ,",
    "thoroughly studied in the continuum theory of kinetic roughening , large scale morphology changes can be accounted for by assuming a growth velocity which is a symmetric function of the local inclination of the interface .",
    "the analysis of this equation under a growth rate inhomogeneity then leads to a _",
    "nonequilibrium _ steady state ( ss ) which emerges in the form of a macroscopic hill @xcite . here",
    ", we show that a similar scenario may also arise under equilibrium and near equilibrium conditions dominated by unusual scaling regimes .    in studying the latter it is useful to consider the mean square fluctuations of the average interface height @xmath0 which yields a measure of the interface _ width _ @xmath1",
    "^ 2\\ , \\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] where the brackets denote an ensemble average over all possible evolutions of heights @xmath2 forming the interface at time t , which grows on a substrate of size @xmath3 . on general grounds it can be argued that @xmath4 scales as @xcite @xmath5 where the scaling function @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 hence , it follows that finite systems saturate as @xmath8 , whereas in the thermodynamic limit the asymptotic growth is ruled by the exponent @xmath9 , that is @xmath10 .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 describes the roughness dependence of the interface width on the typical substrate size . in turn",
    "the exponent @xmath12 , often known as the dynamic exponent , gives the fundamental scaling between length and time .    in practice ,",
    "( [ scaling ] ) and ( [ affine ] ) yield a standard procedure which is often followed to extract and corroborate scaling exponents predicted by other approaches and certainly we will make use of this hypothesis as well . however ,",
    "due to the presence of the crossovers referred to above , a complementary procedure would be needed if the former becomes exceptionally slow .",
    "to this aim , we will also exploit the known equivalence between the rsos growth models already mentioned and a one dimensional gas of hard core particles undergoing an asymmetric exclusion process @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the idea is to cast the evolution operator of the associated master equation of this latter process @xcite into a suitable quantum spin representation @xcite lending itself more readily for a finite size scaling analysis . since the dynamic exponent @xmath13 of ( [ scaling ] )",
    "is ultimately embodied in the gap behavior of the evolution operator ( or spin `` hamiltonian '' ) , the study of its lower spectrum can then provide information of the late evolution stages in a more direct manner .",
    "evidently , this methodology along with the evaluation of the roughening exponent @xmath14  simplified greatly by the anchoring boundary conditions  circumvents the problem of arbitrarily long transient regimes though on the other hand is limited severely by the affordable system sizes .",
    "a posteriori , it will turn out that already modest lengths can yield clear finite size trends .",
    "this strategy will be explained in section ii and its results compared with those of standard techniques given in section iii .",
    "we end the paper with section iv which contains our conclusions , along with some remarks on extensions of this work .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of lattice aggregation models with no overhangs , including both adsorption and desorption of monomers at random locations of a one dimensional interface @xcite , such as that described in fig .",
    "1 . as usual , on a coarse grained level of description the state of a surface at a given time is represented by a set of single valued functions @xmath15 measuring the surface heights at positions @xmath16 of the growth substrate . as it was mentioned above , we are interested in boundary conditions that suppress completely height fluctuations at @xmath17 and @xmath18 for all times , i.e. the interface is anchored at the boundaries . for simplicity ,",
    "we study the case where @xmath3 is even and @xmath19 , whereas deposition and evaporation rates @xmath20 are taken uniformly throughout the system except on site @xmath21 where these probability values are respectively @xmath22 . to prevent the divergence of interface fluctuations in the bulk , we impose a rsos constraint namely , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "specifically , growth ( evaporation ) events @xmath25 [ @xmath26 , with @xmath27 occur only at local minima ( maxima ) of the evolving interface . these basic processes and their transition rates",
    "are schematized in fig .",
    "1 . in turn",
    ", the typical configurations resulting from these rules at large times are displayed by the snapshots of fig .",
    "it is often convenient to consider the interface slope rather than the height , so hereafter we will exploit the known mapping between rsos interface dynamics and quantum spin-@xmath28 systems .",
    "this correspondence can be easily visualized in the scheme of fig .",
    "1 . associating the height difference @xmath29 to an eigenvalue of the @xmath30component , say , of the pauli operator @xmath31 for site @xmath32 , all relevant quantities of the interface , such as its width and height - height correlations , can be casted in terms of @xmath28-spinors . by construction , it is clear that the interface heights ( relative to @xmath33 ) are obtained as @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the anchoring condition @xmath19 imposes the vanishing of the total magnetization throughout the underlying spin kinetics .",
    "as is well known , the probability distribution of such markov processes is controlled by a master equation @xcite @xmath36\\,,\\ ] ] whose transition probability rates @xmath37 , now denote the ( biased ) spin exchanges at which a generic configuration @xmath38 evolves to @xmath39 through a single exchange of two consecutive spins . starting from a given probability distribution @xmath40 , eq.([me ] ) can be conveniently thought of as a schrdinger like representation in which the ensemble averaged state vector @xmath41 ( playing the role of wave function ) , can be evaluated at subsequent times from the action of an evolution operator ( or `` hamiltonian '' ) on the initial state , namely @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the specific form of @xmath43 can be readily obtained by introducing spin-@xmath44 raising and lowering operators @xmath45 , along with spin occupation fields @xmath46 .",

    "the biased hopping terms of ( [ evol0 ] ) clearly describe the original growth  desorption events ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , while conservation of probability requires in turn the appearance of the remaining ( diagonal ) particle - vacancy correlators .",
    "we address the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed derivation in related systems .      before continuing with an alternative spin representation more suitable to study dynamical aspects at large times",
    ", we pause and consider the ss of eq.([evol0 ] ) along with its implications on the interface character .    given two spin configurations",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 , differing at most in the state of two neighboring @xmath53 locations , evidently detailed balance probabilities in ( [ me ] ) will hold provided that @xmath54 this can be readily satisfied defining a hard - core particle ( up spin ) potential @xmath55 through which the equilibrium distribution is simply obtained as @xmath56\\,.\\ ] ] when @xmath57 , these probabilities further enable us to construct the partition function ( normalization constant ) , height profiles ( spin densities ) , as well as the spin correlation functions needed to derive the equilibrium interface width . for @xmath58 a rather involved recursive relation in the particle number can be obtained for all these quantities , but its analytic solution is not reachable by standard means @xcite . however , this case does _ not _ yield a rough interface as statistical fluctuations become exponentially suppressed in time ( see section iii b ) .    if @xmath57 , the step function potential ( [ potential ] ) permits to divide the system into two independent regions @xmath59,\\ , [ \\frac{l}{2}+1 , l]\\,$ ] with @xmath60 configurations having @xmath61 and @xmath62-particles respectively ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "hence , the partition function normalizing the above ss distribution is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "using analogous arguments , we can also obtain the reduced partition function @xmath66 which arises from the occupation of a given site @xmath67 , and evaluate the spin density @xmath68 .",

( [ tilt ] ) entails the sideways growth of a hill ( valley ) whose sides at large times are tilted by an amount of @xmath74 relative to the substrate .    to determine whether this morphology is actually rough",
    ", we focus attention on the equilibrium height fluctuations @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , first we evaluate the spin - spin correlations involved in @xmath76 .",
    "thus , once more we recur to the combinatorial reasoning and calculate the reduced partition functions @xmath77 resulting from the occupation of two specific sites @xmath78 . after some elementary steps",
    "we obtain @xmath79 from which the required spin correlations are computed as @xmath80 . in the large size",
    "limit the analysis of eqs . (",
    "[ partition ] ) , ( [ density ] ) and ( [ correlation ] ) ultimately yields a rough interface ( see leftmost snapshot of fig .",
    "2 ) , whose height fluctuations ( canceled at the boundaries ) , result distributed as @xmath81 .",
    "this simple form contrast with that observed in nonequilibrium ss of anchored self organized interfaces in which fluctuations in the upper part of the hill are substantially reduced @xcite .",
    "the above correlations can also characterize the saturation width referred to in section i. specifically , in the spin representation it can be easily checked that @xmath82 may be rewritten as @xmath83 in fig .",
    "3 we display the size dependence of @xmath4 for several values of @xmath84 .",
    "it turns out that the roughness exponent @xmath14 bears the discontinuous character of eqs .",
    "( [ density ] ) and ( [ correlation ] ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath85 often , a value of @xmath86 is special because it signals that the assumption of a well defined average orientation of the interface ( parallel to the substrate plane ) , becomes inconsistent .",
    "certainly , this is in line with the tilt obtained in eq .",
    "( [ tilt ] ) . for @xmath87 the conventional ( diffusive )",
    "roughening is recovered ; here the tilt vanishes and the orientational fluctuations at large scales estimated , for example , as @xmath88 , decrease with @xmath3 .",
    "we shall revisit this point later on in section iii a.      as is known @xcite , detailed balance guarantees the existence of a representation in which the evolution operator ( [ evol0 ] ) is self - adjoint .",
    "although an exact solution of the ( real ) @xmath89-spectrum in the thermodynamic limit seems unlikely irrespective of its representation , at least a self - adjoint description can facilitate the numerical analysis of a finite size scaling approach .",
    "specifically , one can readily find a similarity transformation to map ( [ evol0 ] ) into an hermitian matrix , and thereafter obtain the lower eigenmodes dominating the asymptotic kinetics via recursion - type algorithms , e.g. the lanczos technique @xcite , appropriate to study fair system sizes .    to this aim and with the aid of the particle potential introduced in ( [ potential ] ) , we rotate the above operator around the @xmath13 spin direction using a pure imaginary site dependent argument @xmath90 @xmath91 this rotation is produced by the non - unitary similarity transformation @xmath92 with @xmath93 , which in turn results in the direct product @xmath94\\,.\\ ] ] while the diagonal terms of ( [ evol0 ] ) remain unaltered by @xmath95 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath96 from this latter transformation , one can immediately verify that the rotated ( self - adjoint ) operator @xmath97 becomes an open @xmath98 ferromagnet with a defect coupling under _ local _ magnetic fields , namely @xmath99\\ , \\\\",

    "thus , we are left with a diagonalization problem which , to some extent , is now controllable by standard recursive techniques ( section iii ) .    for the sake of completeness it is worth pointing out that the similarity transformation ( [ similarity ] ) also enables us to obtain the ss distribution ( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "in fact , exploiting that @xmath89 is a stochastic operator , we can express its _ left _",
    "ss @xmath102 as an equally weighted sum of all accessible configurations @xcite , i.e. @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes the ferromagnetic down spin state .",
    "hence , by construction @xmath105 is a ( unnormalized ) ground state of @xmath106 , and therefore the ss distribution in the initial @xmath89-representation is constructed as @xmath107 thus recovering the equilibrium distribution ( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "returning to the dynamics , the average value of a diagonal quantity @xmath108 such as the `` width operator '' involved in eq . ( [ width]) varies according to @xmath109 @xcite . since @xmath108 is invariant under @xmath95 , it is a simple matter to check that in the self - adjoint representation @xmath110 reads @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a complete orthonormal set of eigenstates of @xmath113 ( all with @xmath114 ) .",
    "as expected , the role of initial conditions becomes irrelevant near the equilibrium regime .",
    "if the spectrum gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , the width approach to equilibrium will involve arbitrarily large times for sufficiently large systems . in those situations , finite size scaling analyses of the first excited levels @xmath115 would then provide the dynamic @xmath13-exponent ruling over the late roughening stages referred to in section i.    a distinctive feature arises when all components of the total angular momentum @xmath116 are preserved by @xmath113 , namely for @xmath57 and @xmath117 . since @xmath118 just involves operators of the form @xmath119",
    "[ see eq.([width ] ) ] , then rather restrictive selection rules hold for its matrix elements in ( [ w ] ) .",
    "specifically , given that @xmath112 can be classified according to the total spin @xmath120 [ @xmath121 , the non - vanishing contributions to eq.([w ] ) come only from states @xmath122 having @xmath123 and @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "what should be emphasized here is that as soon as @xmath125 \\ne 0\\,$ ] the _ effective _ density of states , partly responsible for the temporal asymptotic behavior of ( [ w ] ) when @xmath70 , is drastically modified as these selection rules no longer apply .",
    "we will come back to this issue within the numerical context of section iii a.",
    "to explore the dynamical consequences of these arguments we have carried out monte carlo simulations as well as finite size scaling analyses of the rsos model referred to above , for a variety of situations .",
    "first we focus attention on the subcase @xmath57 where the roles of @xmath126 and @xmath127 are clearly interchangeable , so we restrict the analysis to , say , @xmath128 . in this situation",
    "the interface actually roughens and exhibits two different scaling regimes accompanying a large scale morphological transition .",
    "the discussion of different bulk probability rates is addressed at the second part of the section .",
    "it will turn out there that fluctuations decay very rapidly and prevent the roughening of anchored interfaces at large times . instead , a faceting dynamics will emerge regardless of the inhomogeneity growth rates      starting from an initially flat configuration we studied the evolution of the interface width and monitored the height profiles at different growth stages .",
    "4 displays the width behavior obtained for @xmath130 and 0.8 .",
    "the rather slow crossover ( particularly for 0.8 , where it is only incipient ) , deterred us of using larger substrates , though preliminary simulations averaged over few evolution samples indicated similar trends .",
    "the early growing stages support a power law growth @xmath10 extended over more than four decades with an exponent @xmath131 .",
    "this typical diffusive behavior is accompanied initially by a height profile which is almost parallel to the substrate , except in the neighborhood of the growth inhomogeneity . as is shown in the inset of fig . 4 ,",
    "on approaching the asymptopia however , the slopes of the hillsides steepen until they reach the equilibrium tilt alluded to in eq.([tilt ] ) .",
    "this progressive orientation departure signals a large scale morphological transition which in turn is also reflected in the increase of the growth exponent . in the late dynamic stages , this can be well fitted by a value of @xmath132 for nearly two decades .",
    "an alternative determination of this rather peculiar value @xcite , can be implemented by resorting to the phenomenological scaling assumption referred to in eq.([scaling ] ) along with the findings and arguments of section ii .",
    "notice that this provides two independent numerical procedures to estimate the dynamic @xmath13-exponent needed for the knowledge of @xmath133 . on one hand ,",
    "the former can be calculated by studying the finite size behavior of the first excited levels of @xmath113 ( in principle , just the lowest will do ) , so we diagonalized it exactly via a recursion type lanczos algorithm @xcite applied on the zero magnetization subspace .",
    "the huge dimensionality of this sector , growing as @xmath134 , as well as the lack of translational symmetry of the evolution operator , limited our computations to chain lengths of up to 24 spins .",
    "nevertheless , they proved to be sufficient for a fair estimation of the spectrum gap .",
    "we direct the reader to fig .",
    "5 which suggests a decrease @xmath135 for the gap and other excited levels consistent with a common value of @xmath136 .",
    "on the other hand , an independent evaluation of this exponent can be attained by studying the scaling behavior of the interface width [ eq.([scaling ] ) ] .",
    "6 exhibits the results of our simulations for growth substrates of 2500 and 5000 heights on approaching their saturation regimes . here",
    ", the data collapse was obtained upon setting @xmath137 , which confirms not only the lanczos estimation but also corroborates the roughness exponent quoted in eq.([roughness ] ) .",
    "thus , from eq.([scaling ] ) it follows that the fast roughening behavior already observed in fig .",
    "4 , is now recovered by the ratio @xmath138 .    since the lanczos analysis continues to yield values of @xmath139 holding up to the homogeneous situation ( as it should ) ,",
    "a natural question one can pose is therefore : through which feature does the dynamics render a completely different roughening behavior at large times as soon as @xmath140 ? in an attempt to provide a plausible explanation for the appearance of this abrupt change [ see also eq.([roughness ] ) ] , we resort to the observations given by the end of section ii b. the inset of fig",
    ". 5 displays the lower part of the @xmath113-spectrum for both inhomogeneous and homogeneous situations .",
    "as stated above , the latter involves at most @xmath141 contributing levels with @xmath142 , while in the former case the sum of eq.([w ] ) becomes much denser as @xmath125 \\ne 0\\,$ ] and an exponential number of _ new _ states arises .",
    "of course , the new matrix elements might eventually change from zero in a continuous manner , but the density of states ( a measure of which is given by the inverse of the levels spacing ) , varies abruptly .",
    "moreover , some of the low lying excitations controlling the asymptotic regime ( @xmath143 holding @xmath144 ) , suggest a rather narrowly peaked structure which is entirely absent for @xmath117 .    also , it is interesting to examine whether the large scale morphology transition embodied in the slow temporal crossover of @xmath145 affects the usual scaling hypothesis of eqs.([scaling ] ) and ( [ affine ] ) .",
    "thus , we turn to the early dynamic scaling of @xmath145 shown by the inset of fig . 6 .",
    "in contrast to the super - diffusive growth observed at late stages , here the data collapse arises by setting standard diffusive exponents @xmath146 which in turn yield a scaling function @xmath147 , in agreement with the early @xmath148 exponent measured in fig .",
    ", combining the late and early scaling regimes it follows that @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a crossover time which depends solely on @xmath151 ( eventually diverging in the limit @xmath152 ) , and @xmath153 is a universal function defined over three different scales as @xmath154    in what follows we address finally to the @xmath155 situation .      a quick glance at the evolution of the interface width displayed in fig .",
    "7 might render the ( wrong ) impression that the general case @xmath155 , @xmath157 bears similar characteristics .",
    "however this time the growth exponent exhibits an asymptotic value of @xmath158 which is not understandable in terms of conventional kinetic roughening theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , the interface does not roughen .",
    "let us first provide a simple explanation for this large value of @xmath133 by means of the following heuristic considerations .",
    "for clarity of argument , assume vanishing desorption rates and @xmath159 .",
    "starting from a flat configuration , say with @xmath160 , a _",
    "dynamics arises as @xmath161 deposition attempts occur on the initial @xmath161 interface minima .",
    "next , we are left with @xmath162 and @xmath163 contiguous minima over which new @xmath163 depositions will be once again deterministic . by iterating this argumentation",
    "@xmath164-times , this dynamics leads to a configuration resembling a truncated pyramid ( see central snapshot of fig .",
    "2 , though for for a non - deterministic situation , i.e. @xmath165 ) . specifically , there will be @xmath166 contiguous minima in between @xmath167 and @xmath168 . using the common definition of eq.([width0 ] ) , it is then easy to verify that the `` width '' of such configuration is simply @xmath169\\,,\\:\\:\\:{\\rm i.e.}\\ : \\beta = 3/2\\,.\\ ] ]    the above argument describes rather a _ faceting _ process ( terminating at @xmath170 ) , which strictly applies for @xmath171 . certainly , as soon as @xmath172 the dynamics is no longer deterministic , no matter how small @xmath173 is .",
    "however , for @xmath174 the early desorption attempts become gradually unsuccessful as the active region of the interface , i.e. the number of available minima , decreases inasmuch the sideways region is increasingly jammed ( fig .",
    "2 ) . thus , at large times",
    "a process similar to a faceting dynamics might be expected , at least for small bulk desorption rates .",
    "in fact , for @xmath175 and @xmath176 our numerical simulations confirm these considerations .",
    "no differences were observed between sampling histories at large times , so fluctuations become asymptotically negligible . for @xmath177",
    "the situation is similar though another faceting process shows up around the inhomogeneity , as displayed by the height profiles in the inset of fig .",
    "7 ( see also rightmost snapshot of fig .",
    "2 ) . of course",
    ", for @xmath178 the roles of @xmath179 and @xmath180 are interchanged .",
    "ultimately , the whole process approaches a non - fluctuating pile of slope @xmath181 , so long as @xmath182 .    to provide an alternative understanding of this fast fluctuation decay for generic rate values ,",
    "we recur once more to the analysis of the spectrum of the evolution operator ( [ evol ] ) .",
    "the gap and levels obtained for the sizes within our reach are shown in fig 8 , but in contrast to the @xmath183 situation , here the finite size trend of these quantities needs further analysis . to this end",
    ", we studied the @xmath113-spectrum within the subspace @xmath184 ( single spin excitation ) , which corresponds to the much simpler anchoring case @xmath185 . for this sector , it is straightforward to check that eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) reduces to the tridiagonal matrix @xmath186\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath187 evidently , this just constitutes the simplest approximation to the many body problem of @xmath188 .",
    "nevertheless , the comparisons of fig . 8 indicate that the eigenvalues of ( [ tri ] ) yet provide an excellent estimation of the actual gap and other excited levels obtained through the lanczos scheme .",
    "( it is worth pointing out in passing that an excellent fit of these quantities was also found for @xmath183 ) . using the spectrum gap of the single spin approximation , the inset of fig .",
    "8 strongly suggests that the _ same _ gap will persist for @xmath189 in the thermodynamic limit of ( [ evol ] ) .",
    "similar gapful results were obtained for other values of @xmath190 .",
    "thus , fluctuations would be suppressed at large times , which is in line with the almost invariant values of @xmath4 observed over many sample histories .",
    "also , at the gap level the density of states diverges as @xmath3 in the simplified version of the problem . for @xmath188",
    "however , one might conjecture a much stronger divergence , probably growing like @xmath191 , as the number of levels between two single excitations tends to increase exponentially with the system size ( at least for the small lengths at hand ) .",
    "this would leave us with a saturation time @xmath192 in eq.([w ] ) , which on the other hand would be in agreement with the termination time of the faceting process idealized above .",
    "in fact , the numerical simulations displayed in fig .",
    "9 lend further support to these speculations .",
    "clearly , these results exhibit both a saturation time @xmath192 , as well as an asymptotic scaling regime consistent with eq.([heuristic ] ) , i.e. @xmath193 , during which both height and width fluctuations are absent .",
    "in contrast , at early stages the interface displays typical roughening features .",
    "specifically , the inset of fig . 9 exhibits a diffusive scaling regime @xmath194 , in turn corroborated by the growth exponent @xmath131 obtained in larger systems ( fig .",
    "this strong departure from the faceting description occurs on temporal scales smaller than a crossover time which turns out to decrease when @xmath195 ( irrespective of @xmath190 ) , but eventually diverging in the limit @xmath196 , @xmath197 .",
    "we have analyzed the characteristics of both early and asymptotic dynamics of one dimensional anchored interfaces under a growth inhomogeneity .",
    "there are two sets of results related respectively to equal or different growth - evaporation rates in the bulk .    for @xmath57 ,",
    "even the slightest departure from the homogeneous @xmath198 situation is able to produce finite interface tilts as well as huge temporal crossovers .",
    "the problems posed by the latter have been bypassed studying _ separately _ the roughness @xmath11 and dynamic @xmath12 exponents , the evaluation of which was significantly simplified by the appearance of equilibrium ss . in analyzing finite size scaling trends of the spectrum gap via the lanczos method , we found no changes with respect to the homogeneous situation , i.e. @xmath199 .",
    "consequently , it was argued that the breaking of the full rotational invariance of the evolution operator is ultimately responsible for the emergence of a much heavier density of states accounting both for the discontinuity of the roughness exponent @xmath11 ( or alternatively , for a different asymptotic growth exponent @xmath148 ) , as well as for the rise of a new scaling regime at large times .",
    "these expectations were confronted independently with standard numerical simulations monitoring the evolution of the interface profile and width . at early stages , the latter exhibits a diffusive scaling regime having basically a non - tilted profile ( except in the inhomogeneity neighborhood ) , but progressively approaching a final regime consistent with our scaling exponents @xmath200 .",
    "however for @xmath201 , in practice this new regime might occur at a time so large as to render it numerically unobservable .",
    "for @xmath155 the situation is entirely different . here",
    ", the spectrum gap does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit regardless of the inhomogeneity rates , and fluctuations between evolution histories at large times become negligible .",
    "this confirms an heuristic description ( in turn , tested independently by simulations ) , suggesting that the asymptotic dynamics becomes almost deterministic .",
    "we may also think of a synchronous discrete time process in which a randomly chosen finite fraction , or possibly all of the growth sites , are simultaneously updated in a single time step .",
    "one characteristic feature of such synchronous models is the occurrence of faceting transitions at large times @xcite , which also turned out to be the case here .",
    "in contrast , at early stages the interface actually roughens following a typical diffusive pattern accompanied by a standard scaling regime .    the analysis of nonequilibrium asymptotic situations , even for @xmath202 , might become rather involved .",
    "in this sense , it will be interesting to elucidate whether a direct evaluation of @xmath11 could be achieved using the matrix approach to the asymmetric exclusion process @xcite with both injection and ejection of particles at the boundaries , including one or more hoping defects ( that is , unanchored boundaries and growth inhomogeneities in the height representation ) .",
    "higher dimensional extensions of this study would be clearly desirable and more realistic .",
    "however , the analysis of the corresponding quantum spin analogy should involve a projector operator to discard all those spin configurations having magnetic loops , i.e. @xmath203 , with @xmath204 on a given closed path .",
    "otherwise , the mapping would no longer represent an interface .",
    "the issue as to whether or not such ideas are actually practical in @xmath205 remains quite open .        for comprehensive reviews and literature list",
