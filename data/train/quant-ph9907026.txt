    "we consider a single two - level atom with energy eigenstates @xmath1 and @xmath2 under the influence of a time dependent potential @xmath3 .",
    "assuming @xmath3 is not known and the evolution of the atom in the potential can be observed only once , which scheme of measurement conveys the most information about the otherwise undisturbed motion of the state @xmath4 of the atom in the potential ?",
    "we will restrict to a reduced information and ask how to optimally record with minimal disturbance the evolution in time of the squared modulus of one of the components of the state of the atom , say @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the normalized state vector .",
    "what types of measurement are to our disposition ? + in order to detect the evolution of @xmath5 by means of projection measurements of energy , the system has to be prepared new before each measurement in the same initial state with the same potential @xmath3 . if a sequence of consecutive projection measurements is applied because the system can not be prepared new , the dynamics of the atom are in general strongly altered @xcite . in the continuum limit of an infinite sequence of projection measurements the evolution",
    "can even be halted ( quantum zeno effect ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the usual projection measurements are not an appropriate choice to detect characteristic features of the evolution of the atomic state in real - time ( i.e. without resetting the system ) .",
    "in fact for this purpose two requirements have to be fulfilled simultaneously : the influence of the measurement on the dynamics of the system must not be too strong and the measurement readout has to be accurate enough to indicate the evolution of the state .",
    "the difficulty lies in the unavoidable competition of these properties : the better the dynamics are conserved ( i.e. the smaller the influence of the measurement ) , the less reliable is the readout and vice versa .",
    "we will show below that an approach to a real - time visualization can profitably be based on unsharp measurements which for example can be described in the povm formalism @xcite .",
    "unsharp measurements are there associated with observables that can not be represented as projection valued measures but only as positive operator valued measures .",
    "these measurements have the advantage that their influence is less strong than the influence of projection measurements , but at the same time they have a lower resolution . in order to obtain information about @xmath5 in real - time ,",
    "if only one realization of the evolution is available , a whole sequence of unsharp measurements is required . for calculational convenience",
    "we consider such sequences in the limit of continuous measurements .",
    "a continuous measurement of energy lasts over a certain time period ( @xmath7 ) and produces a readout denoted by @xmath8 = \\{(t , e(t))|0\\le t\\le t\\}$ ] which assigns to each time @xmath9 during this period a measured value @xmath10 .",
    "it serves to detect the evolution of a quantum mechanical system .",
    "continuous measurements have been investigated in several contexts @xcite .",
    "since we use unsharp measurements the readout possesses in general a low accuracy and shows quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore these measurements are called continuous _",
    "fuzzy _ measurements .",
    "we will base our considerations below on a phenomenological model , which also makes plausible that a correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath5 is to be expected . for a realization scheme see @xcite .    with continuous fuzzy measurements",
    "we have found a possible candidate for the measurement scheme with the desired properties . but note , that according to the nature of quantum mechanics , there is no scheme that precisely records the evolution of @xmath5 in real - time without influencing it as well .",
    "all we can do is to find a mechanism , that allows a `` best bet '' on the behaviour of @xmath5 , if only one `` run '' is available .",
    "the relation between the modification of the motion of the state and the reliability of a readout has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown for measurements with constant fuzziness , that a visualization can be achieved up to a certain degree if the value of fuzziness is properly chosen . in the present work",
    "we want to extend the investigation to the case where the parameter which determines the fuzziness of the measurement is varied as function of time or is made dependent on the readout @xmath10 of the measurement .",
    "our intention is to show that in this way it is possible to improve the efficiency of the visualization achieved with constant fuzziness .",
    "a restrictive remark has to be made .",
    "we will not try to answer the question posed initially in full generality . instead of the unknown driving potential @xmath3 we will consider the special case of the atom being subject to a @xmath0 pulse of a resonant light field . being initially in the ground state @xmath1 , the atom  in the absence of any measurement  carries out a transition to the upper state @xmath2 ( rabi transition ) .",
    "this is the undisturbed motion to be visualized by means of our measurement scheme .",
    "the evaluation of continuous fuzzy measurements is done by monte carlo simulations . from the results obtained here we get insights for the more general case of an unknown @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains a brief description of the phenomenological model used to describe continuous fuzzy measurements . in section 3",
    "we define quantities that represent the modification of the dynamics due to the influence of the measurement on one hand and the reliability of the readouts on the other .",
    "these quantities are then evaluated for measurements with constant fuzziness . in section 4",
    "we investigate continuous measurements with time dependent fuzziness . in section 5 continuous measurements with fuzziness depending on the readout",
    "are studied .",
    "both are compared with the measurements with constant fuzziness .",
    "the scheme of measurement introduced in section 5 can also be used in the general case of unknown dynamics .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section 6 .",
    "we consider a two level atom submitted to a @xmath11-pulse of intensive , resonant laser light .",
    "the respective hamiltonian reads @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the dipole moment of the atom and @xmath16 is the amplitude of the electric field strength .",
    "the pulse lasts from @xmath17 untill @xmath18 .",
    "if no further influence is present , an atom in the ground state at @xmath17 performs a rabi transition to the upper state @xmath2 in the course of the @xmath11-pulse ( @xmath19 ) . before and after the pulse the dynamics of the atom",
    "is governed by its free hamiltonian @xmath20 a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy ( observable @xmath21 ) during the time interval @xmath22 $ ] containing @xmath23 $ ] produces a readout @xmath8 $ ] .    since we want to discuss a measurement applied to a single atom we employ in the following a selective description of the measurement .",
    "given the initial state of the atom and given a particular readout @xmath8 $ ] , a theory describing continuous fuzzy measurements has to answer the following two questions : i ) how has the state evolved during the measurement and ii ) what is the probability density @xmath24 $ ] to measure the readout @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the answers can be given in a phenomenological theory of continuous measurements .",
    "for a survey of this theory see @xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction , these measurements find their realization by means of sequences of unsharp measurements @xcite .    given a certain readout @xmath8 $ ]",

    "the amount of damping for fixed @xmath31 depends on how close the readout @xmath8 $ ] is to the curve of the expectation value @xmath32 , for details see @xcite .",
    "large damping implies because of ( [ prob ] ) , that the readout is improbable . in ( [ effham ] )",
    "@xmath31 represents the strength of the measurement . if @xmath31 is small , such that @xmath33 dominates @xmath26}$ ] , the measurement perturbs the evolution only a little .",
    "if @xmath31 is great , the evolution is overwhelmed by the influence of the measurement .",
    "the influence of the fuzzy measurement on the atom competes with the influence of the external field driving the atom to the upper level .",
    "the strength of the latter is characterized by half the rabi period @xmath34 - the time a rabi transition takes without measurement . in order to compare both influences ,",
    "we introduce a characteristic time for the continuous measurement @xcite . the effective resolution time @xmath35 may serve as a measure of fuzziness of a continuous measurement . in what follows",
    "we refer to this quantity simply as _",
    "fuzziness _ @xmath36 .",
    "as already pointed out in the introduction , the visualization of a single rabi transition by a continuous measurement becomes efficient if two properties are fulfilled : weak influence ( later on specified as softness ) of the measurement and reliability of the measurement readouts . in this section",
    "we first introduce quantities to specify these properties and then apply them to characterize measurements with constant fuzziness .      for a visualization",
    "the measurement should be likely to only modify and not prevent the rabi transition . in order to fix what can be regarded as a modified or approximate rabi transition , we use the following , somewhat minimal condition : @xmath37 for the component @xmath38}{\\rangle}|^2}{\\sqrt{{\\langle}\\psi_t^{[e]}|\\psi_t^{[e]}{\\rangle}}}\\ge 0.5\\,.\\ ] ] the probability that the state will perform such an approximate rabi transition",
    "is given by @xmath39d[e ] \\;\\;\\;\\mbox{with}\\ ; { \\cal u}=\\{[e]\\mid    the continuous measurement .",
    "what can we read off from a readout [ e ] and how reliable is it ? in order to answer these questions we turn to the realization given in @xcite of the phenomenological scheme we are using .",
    "there it has been shown : if many single weak measurements of energy are performed on the same normalized states @xmath40 , then the statistical mean value @xmath41 of all individual measurement results @xmath42 obeys the relation @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "this has led to the idea to take @xmath45 of a complete single readout @xmath8 $ ] obtained under the influence of the driving potential as an estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "how reliable is this ?    turning again to the total curves we introduce a mean deviation @xmath46 according to    @xmath47d[e]\\frac{1}{t}\\int dt \\left[\\frac{e(t)-e_1}{\\delta e } -|c_2(t)|^2\\right]^2   \\;.\\ ] ]    we call @xmath48 the _ reliability _ of a continuous measurement .",
    "it indicates how reliable it is , that @xmath45 of a single readout agrees with @xmath5 .",
    "we apply the concepts introduced in section [ concepts ] to the special case of measurements with fuzziness @xmath36 kept constant during the measurement ( comp .",
    "the numerically obtained results are displayed in fig .",

    "[ tcomp ] .",
    "[ pconst ] shows , how with growing fuzziness @xmath36 softness @xmath49 increases and reliability @xmath50 decreases . for low fuzziness",
    "we see the zeno regime of strong measurement .",
    "the state motion differs largely from the rabi transition , but is well visualized . in the rabi regime of high fuzziness",
    "the rabi transition of the state is preserved but can not be visualized by the readout .",
    "the relation between reliability and softness for measurements with constant fuzziness can be seen from fig [ tcomp ] ( small circles ) .",
    "the pairs @xmath51 for different values of fuzziness lie almost on a straight line .    returning to our initial question we study a continuous measurement in the intermediate regime . for @xmath52",
    "an approximate transition takes place in @xmath53 percent of the cases ( @xmath54 ) and the mean deviation amounts to @xmath55 in units of @xmath56 .",
    "for a single measurement it is therefore to be expected that the readout @xmath8 $ ] reflects approximately the evolution of @xmath57 .",
    "we now address the question whether an improvement of @xmath50 and @xmath49 can be achieved if fuzziness varies in the course of the measurement .",
    "in order to improve the efficiency of the continuous fuzzy measurement one may for example think of choosing a low fuzziness @xmath36 .",
    "this increases the reliability @xmath50 but decreases softness @xmath49 .",
    "if fuzziness @xmath36 is kept low over the whole measurement not much is gained because the original rabi transition is strongly modified .",
    "but there are specific time intervals at which even a strong influence of an energy measurement ( small softness ) is likely to modify a rabi transition only to a small amount .",
    "this is at the beginning ( @xmath17 ) and at the end ( @xmath18 ) of the @xmath11-pulse when the state of the undisturbed rabi transition is close to an energy eigenstate .",
    "even a projection measurement is not likely to modify the state very much in this case .",
    "just the opposite situation can be found in the middle of a @xmath11-pulse .",
    "both observations lead to the idea to vary fuzziness in time in order to take advantage of the varying sensitivity of the system . in order to do so",

    "is known but it is not known if it is turned on , i.e. @xmath58 , or turned off ( @xmath59 ) . ]",
    "we discuss as above the real - time visualization of a rabi transition .",
    "we assume a time dependent fuzziness @xmath60 of gaussian shape ( comp .",
    "[ gaust ] ) with width @xmath61 .",
    "the maximum @xmath62 is located at the middle of the pulse at @xmath63 .",
    "an offset value @xmath64 is obtained at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in order to see the influence of a varying width @xmath61 , the maximum @xmath62 and the minimum @xmath67",
    "are kept fixed and the gaussian is rescaled appropriately .",
    "this leads to    @xmath68    with @xmath69 and @xmath70    we computed the reliability @xmath50 and softness @xmath49 of measurements with fuzziness @xmath60 for different width @xmath61 .",
    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tcomp ] where pairs of @xmath71 are plotted for time dependent fuzziness ( small squares ) and constant fuzziness ( small circles ) .",
    "we consider a measurement characterized by @xmath72 to be `` better than '' a measurement with @xmath73 if both  the reliability and the softness of the first measurement  are greater : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in fact not all measurements are comparable in terms of this definition but the ones which are better than a particular one lie in the diagram on the right and higher .",
    "the ones worse than the particular one lie to the left and lower .",
    "the best measurement of the diagram would lie in its upper right corner .",
    "[ tcomp ] shows that the results of measurements with constant fuzziness can clearly be improved by using measurements with time dependent fuzziness .",
    "for example the measurement with time dependent fuzziness and width @xmath76 is better than measurements with constant fuzziness with @xmath77 .",
    "the former measurement leads to @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "+    another way to display the results of the numerical calculations are density plots of the readouts @xmath8 $ ] and the curve of the squared component @xmath5 .",
    "the density plot of the readouts @xmath8 $ ] is obtained by dividing the e - t - plane into squares of equal area and calculating the probability that a smoothed curve [ e ] ( c.f .",
    "appendix ) crosses a particular square .",
    "@xmath80 d[e]\\ ; , \\mbox{with}\\;\\ ; s=\\ { [ e]| ( t , e(t))\\in \\mbox{square}\\}\\;.\\ ] ]    the degree of grayness of the square is then chosen according to @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath5-density plot is created analogously , apart from the fact that the curves @xmath5 do not have to be smoothed , since they do not posses rapid oscillations .    in fig .",
    "[ denst ] density plots for constant fuzziness and for time dependent fuzziness are displayed .",
    "the latter shows an improved correlation between readout @xmath8 $ ] and squared component @xmath5 .",
    "in particular we can read off from the energy plots that the area with the second smallest degree of grayness ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) is more narrow for time dependent fuzziness than for constant fuzziness . while in case of constant fuzziness there are still two branches of readouts ( going up and staying down ) , for time dependent fuzziness there is only one strong branch representing curves that show an approximate transition .",
    "the plots of the squared component @xmath5 indicate a greater softness for measurements with time dependent fuzziness .",
    "both kinds of measurements show two branches , for time dependent fuzziness the ends of both branches are more narrow than for constant fuzziness .",
    "in the general case the driving potential @xmath3 and therefore the dynamics of the system without measurement are unknown . it will thus not be possible to design beforehand an adjusted time dependent fuzziness @xmath60 .",
    "nevertheless one can also in this case take advantage of varying fuzziness . applying the same reasoning as for time dependent fuzziness",
    ", we have to use a large fuzziness ( small perturbation by the measurement ) when the system is not close to an energy eigenstate , i.e. for @xmath83 .",
    "the value of the readout @xmath10 is correlated to @xmath5 and @xmath84 .",
    "this means that energy dependent fuzziness @xmath85 should have its maximum near @xmath86 and should be low for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we test this idea once more for the case of a driving potential which leads to a rabi transition if no further influence is present .",

    "dependent fuzziness , there is no improvement of measurements with high or low constant fuzziness .",
    "but in the intermediate regime , which is the important one for visualization , the results for energy dependent fuzziness are better than for constant fuzziness .",
    "it is satisfying that in this regime not only with time dependent but also with energy dependent fuzziness the results from constant fuzziness can be improved .",
    "time dependent fuzziness leads in the intermediate regime to slightly higher values of reliability and softness than energy dependent measurements .",
    "the normalized state @xmath6 of a @xmath94-level atom performs rabi oscillations under the influence of an external driving field .",
    "it is assumed that there is only one realization of this process .",
    "we ask the questions if it is possible to obtain a visualization of @xmath5 in real - time using an appropriate measurement scheme .",
    "it is shown that this is possible up to a certain degree , if a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy is performed leading to a readout @xmath8 $ ] . in order to quantify the efficiency of visualization for a given fuzziness we have introduced for a measurement the complementary concepts of softness ( small disturbing influence ) and reliability ( the curve of @xmath5 agrees essentially with the readout @xmath8 $ ] ) .",
