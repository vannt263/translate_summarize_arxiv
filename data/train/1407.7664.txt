    "when quantum particles interact by a short - range potential with a scattering length much larger than the potential range , they may form universal bound states whose properties are independent of microscopic physics  @xcite . besides universal @xmath2-boson bound states in one dimension  @xcite and in two dimensions  @xcite , the most remarkable example is the efimov effect in three dimensions , which predicts the emergence of an infinite tower of three - boson bound states with orbital angular momentum @xmath3 whose binding energies obey the universal exponential scaling  @xcite .",
    "we also solved the two coupled integral equations ( [ eq : residue ] ) numerically with @xmath1 at mass ratios of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and observed that the obtained binding energies asymptotically approach the predicted doubly exponential scaling for each mass ratio .",
