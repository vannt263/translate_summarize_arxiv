    "<S> we propose a flavor symmetric approach to unify the origin of dark matter ( dm ) with the non - zero @xmath0 in the lepton sector . in this framework , the breaking of a @xmath1 flavor symmetry to a remnant @xmath2 ensures the stability of the dm and gives rise to a modification to the existing @xmath3-based tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing to attain the required non - zero values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a range of higgs portal coupling of the dm which can be potentially accessible at various ongoing and future direct and collider search experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> flavor symmetries play important roles in understanding many issues in particle physics including quark and lepton mixing as well as mass hierarchies . </S>",
    "<S> historically a global @xmath1 flavor symmetry was proposed to explain the quark mass hierarchy and cabibbo mixing angle  @xcite which was extended to explain neutrino masses and mixing later . among others , a tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) lepton mixing generated from a discrete flavor symmetry such as @xmath3 gets particular attention  @xcite due to its simplicity and predictive nature . however , the tbm mixing primarily is associated with a vanishing reactor mixing angle @xmath0 which is against the recent robust observation of non - zero @xmath5  @xcite by double chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite and t2k  @xcite experiments . </S>",
    "<S> hence , an alteration to tbm structure has been under scanner .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is another outstanding problem in particle physics today . </S>",
    "<S> although astrophysical evidences , such as rotation curves of galaxies , gravitational lensing and large scale structure of the universe supports the existence of dm  @xcite , a discovery in laboratory is still awaited . </S>",
    "<S> the relic abundance of dm has been measured by wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite satellite experiments to be about 26.8% of the total energy budget of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> although this hints towards a broad classification of dm scenarios , its properties apart from gravitational interactions , are not known yet .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a @xmath1 flavor extension of the standard model ( sm ) to unify the origin of dm with the simultaneous realization of non - zero @xmath4 in the lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we presume the existence of a tbm neutrino mixing pattern ( in a basis where charged leptons are diagonal ) and a dark sector consisting of vector like leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that this serves as a minimal extension of the sm to accommodate dm and non - zero @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath6 represents the flavon fields charged under @xmath7 , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of which ( @xmath8 ) would break the @xmath3 and generate the flavor structure of the lepton sector . the flavon field ( @xmath9 ) charged under </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 plays the role of a messenger between the dark sector and sm particles including left - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 symmetry , once allowed to be broken by the vev of @xmath9 , generates a non - zero @xmath4 and a higgs portal coupling to the vecor - like leptonic dm in the effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the non - zero values of @xmath4 are correlated to the higgs portal coupling of the dm which yields the correct relic density measured by wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future direct search experiments , such as xenon1 t  @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite can establish a bridge between the two invisible sectors by measuring the higgs portal coupling of dm .    </S>",

    "<S> the tbm mixing matrix  @xcite can be represented by : @xmath13 implying @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the above structure of @xmath17 can be obtained in a @xmath3 based set - up either in a type - i or ii see - saw framework  @xcite or through higher dimensional lepton number violating operators . for example , we can have altarelli - feruglio ( af ) model  @xcite , where the sm doublet leptons ( @xmath18 ) are transforming as triplet under the @xmath3 while the singlet charged leptons @xmath19 and @xmath20 transform as @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . then a higher dimensional operator of the form , @xmath23 can be considered , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are singlet and triplet flavon fields ( they are sm singlet and transform under @xmath3 ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is the cut off scale of the theory and @xmath27 represents the relative strength between the two couplings involved . </S>",
    "<S> once these flavons get vevs , a flavor structure can be generated after electroweak symmetry breaking with @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 . with a judicious choice of additional discrete symmetries like @xmath31 or more </S>",
    "<S> , one can ensure that no other terms involving these flavons and sm fields are allowed at @xmath32 order or below so as to keep the structure of @xmath17 intact as in eq . </S>",

    "<S> , we introduce an additional global @xmath1 flavor symmetry which will be broken into a remnant @xmath2 and an additional contribution to @xmath17 becomes functional . </S>",
    "<S> none of the fields in the above dimension-6 operators , responsible for tbm mixing , would carry any @xmath1 charge in order to generate non - zero @xmath33 and establish a connection to the dark sector .    </S>",
    "<S> simplest way to connect non - zero @xmath33 and dark sector is achieved by assuming a minimal fermionic dm framework consisted of a vector - like @xmath34 doublet fermion @xmath35 and a vector - like neutral singlet fermion @xmath36  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these fermions are charged under the additional @xmath1 flavor symmetry , but neutral under the existing symmetry in the neutrino sector ( say the non - abelian @xmath3 and additional discrete symmetries required ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce two other sm singlet flavon fields @xmath9 and @xmath37 which carry equal and opposite charges under the @xmath1 symmetry but transform as @xmath38 and @xmath22 under @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sm fields are neutral under this additional @xmath1 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian , invariant under the symmetries considered , describing the interaction between the dark and the sm sector is then given by : @xmath39 we keep @xmath40 as a free parameter at present . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is allowed since the @xmath1 charge of @xmath41 is compensated by @xmath42 and @xmath36 , while the second term is allowed since the @xmath1 charges of @xmath9 and @xmath37 cancel with each other . </S>",
    "<S> this also ensures that @xmath9 and @xmath37 do not take part in @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed structure of the scenario is left for a future work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of introducing a vector like fermion in the dark sector is also motivated by the fact that we expect a replication of the sm yukawa type interaction to be present in the dark sector as well . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 field plays the role of the messenger field similar to the one considered in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see  @xcite , for some earlier efforts to relate @xmath3 flavor symmetry to dm .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath9 and @xmath37 acquire vevs , the @xmath1 symmetry breaks into a remnant @xmath2 symmetry under which the vector - like fermions @xmath42 and @xmath36 are odd . consequently the dm emerges as an admixture of the neutral component of the vector - like fermions @xmath42 and @xmath36 and yields a larger region of allowed parameter space as we will shortly demonstrate . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction strength of the dm with the sm higgs is then given by @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lagrangian ] ) provides an additional contribution to the light neutrino mass matrix as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this typical flavor structure follows from the involvement of @xmath37 field , which transforms as @xmath47 under @xmath3  @xcite .    from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ neutrino - mass ] ) and ( [ neutrino - correction ] ) , we get the light neutrino mass matrix as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we have already seen that the @xmath49 can be diagonalized by @xmath50 alone , so an additional rotation ( @xmath51 ) is required to diagonalize @xmath52 : @xmath53 here we assume all parameters @xmath54 are real for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore obtain  @xcite @xmath55 then comparing the standard @xmath56 parametrization and neutrino mixing matrix @xmath57 we get @xmath58=0 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly @xmath33 depends only on @xmath59 as shown in fig [ fig : s ] . the horizontal patch in fig [ fig : s ] denotes the allowed 3@xmath60 range of @xmath33 ( @xmath61 0.1330 - 0.1715 )  @xcite which is in turn restrict the range of @xmath59 parameter denoted by the vertical patch on the figure . </S>",
    "<S> note that the interaction strength of dm with the sm particles depend on @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we find that the size of @xmath33 is intimately related with the higgs portal coupling of dm . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important observation in this letter and is demonstrated in the rest of the paper . </S>",
    "<S> the two other mixing angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 fall in the right ballpark while light neutrino mass satisfy the @xmath65 ev@xmath66 and @xmath67 ev@xmath66  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> note , both flavour and the dark sector constrains the ratio @xmath59 , instead of the new physics scale @xmath26 in the effective operator formalism considered here . since @xmath42 and @xmath36 are vector - like fermions , they can have bare masses , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are not protected by the sm symmetry and @xmath70 , which are also allowed by the symmetry considered . however their contribution ( @xmath71 ) to the mass matrix @xmath72 is negligibly small compared to the bare masses and @xmath73 </S>",

    "<S> the electroweak phase transition also gives rise a mixing between @xmath76 and @xmath36 . in the basis @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> , the mass matrix is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalizing the above mass matrix we get the mass eigenvalues as @xmath80 and @xmath81 corresponding to the mass eigenstates @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath82 is the lightest odd particle and hence constitute the dm of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle is given by @xmath84 in the small mixing limit where @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> here , we note that small mixing is necessary for the model to provide a dm with viable relic density . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , the larger is the doublet content in dm @xmath82 , the annihilation goes up significantly in particular through @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> so in the limit , @xmath83 is dominantly a doublet having a small admixture of the singlet one . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath83 mass is required to be larger than 45 gev in order not to conflict with the invisible @xmath87-boson decay width . in the physical spectrum </S>",
