    "consider for instance a hamiltonian system @xmath0 of finite degrees of freedom where @xmath1 are the position - momentum canonical coordinates .",
    "then , the time evolution of a probability density function @xmath2 describing the system at time @xmath3 is governed by the liouville s equation , @xmath4 with the poisson bracket defined as follows , @xmath5\\,.\\ ] ] by formally differentiating @xmath6 with respect to time , when @xmath7 are solutions of the hamiltonian equations , we recover the liouville s theorem as stated by gibbs `` the distribution function is constant along any trajectory in phase space '' , i.e. , @xmath8 the method of characteristics says indeed that if the hamiltonian is sufficiently smooth and generates a unique hamiltonian flow @xmath9 on the phase - space , then the density function @xmath2 is uniquely determined by its initial value @xmath10 and it is given as the backward propagation along the characteristics , i.e. , @xmath11 it is known that liouville s theorem holds true in a broader context than those of hamiltonian systems . consider a differential equation , @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a given smooth vector field such that a unique flow map @xmath15 exists and solves the ode .",
    "if the system is at an initial statistical state described by a probability density function @xmath16 at @xmath17 , then under the flow map @xmath9 , the evolution of this state is described by a density @xmath18 , which is the pull - back of the initial one , @xmath19 if the vector field @xmath20 satisfies the liouville s property , which is the following divergence - free condition , @xmath21 then the flow map @xmath9 is volume preserving ( i.e.  lebesgue measure preserving ) on the phase space and for all times the density @xmath18 verifies the liouville s equation , @xmath22 once again , when the vector field @xmath20 is sufficiently smooth the theory of characteristics says that is the unique solution of the liouville s equation with the initial value @xmath16 .",
    "this enlightens the relationship between individual solutions of the ode and statistical ( probability measure ) solutions of the liouville s equation .",
    "hence , one can easily believe that those results reflect a fundamental relation that may extend to non - smooth vector fields or to dynamical systems with infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "actually , the non - smooth framework has been extensively studied and uniqueness of probability measure solutions of liouville s equation is established via a general superposition principle , see e.g.  @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the extension to dynamical systems with infinite degrees of freedom is less investigated .",
    "there are indeed fewer results @xcite and as far as we understand those attempts do not apply to classical pdes .",
    "however , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix c ) the authors established a general uniqueness result for measure - valued solutions to liouville s equation of hamiltonian pdes and used it to derive the mean - field limit of bose gases .",
    "our aim in this article is to improve the result in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix c ) , to give a detailed and accessible presentation , and to provide some applications to nonlinear classical pdes like hartree , klein - gordon , schrdinger , wave , yukawa equations .    beyond the fact that liou ville s equation is the natural ground for a statistical theory of hamiltonian pdes that will be fruitful to develop in a general and systematic way ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    "; there is another concrete reason to address the previous uniqueness property .",
    "in fact , when we study the relationship between quantum field theories and classical pdes we encounter such uniqueness problem , see @xcite . roughly speaking , the quantum counterpart of liouville s equation is the von neumann equation describing the time evolution of quantum states of ( linear ) hamiltonian systems .",
    "if we consider the classical limit , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an effective `` planck constant '' which depends on the scaling of the system at hand , then quantum states transform in the limit @xmath23 into probability measures satisfying a liouville equation related to a nonlinear hamiltonian pde , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , the uniqueness property for probability measure solutions of liouville s equation is a crucial step towards a rigourous justification of the classical limit or the so - called bohr s correspondence principle for quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "it is not so clear how to generalize the characteristics method for hamiltonian systems with infinite degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties for instance is the lack of translation - invariant measures on infinite dimensional normed spaces .",
    "nevertheless , there is an interesting approach ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) related to optimal transport theory that improves the standard characteristics method by using a regularization argument and the differential structure of spaces of probability measures . in particular ,",
    "this approach avoids the use of a reference measure and it is suitable for generalization to systems with infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "this was exploited in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the precise meaning of the equation will be explained in the next section . the aforementioned result in ( * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , we exclusively relay on the weak narrow topology , which is more flexible .",
    "more importantly , we relax the above scalar velocity estimate so that the required assumption is now : @xmath31 this means that the vector field @xmath20 maps @xmath32 into @xmath33 while before @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , we have replaced the @xmath35 norm with a @xmath36 norm and respectively the @xmath29 norm by @xmath37 . in particular , the assumption allows to consider more singular nonlinearities . to enlighten the type of results we obtain here , we consider the following example",

    "remark that the requirement says essentially that the energy mean with respect to @xmath51 is finite .",
    "because of energy and mass conservation , in this case , the estimate holds true for all times if we assume it at time @xmath55 .",
    "notice also that in several other examples , some are provided in section [ se.w1examples ] , the assumption can not be verified while is satisfied . in particular , the improvement provided in this article allows to show general and stronger results in the mean - field theory of quantum many - body dynamics , see @xcite .",
    "our proof of the uniqueness property relies on a probabilistic representation for measure - valued solutions to continuity equations in finite dimension due to s.  maniglia @xcite who extended a previous result of l.  ambrosio , n.  gigli and g.  savar ( * ? ? ?",
