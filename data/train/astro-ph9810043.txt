    "the properties of molecular clouds in the galactic center ( gc ) are known to be influenced by special environmental effects such as strong tidal fields , strong mass concentration and energetic activities .",
    "there have been many observations to study the structure and kinematics of such gc molecular clouds .",
    "since different molecular lines trace clouds of different densities , the comparison of several different observations should be very useful in understanding the nature of the clouds in the gc .",
    "for example , co ( bitran 1987 ) and hcn ( lee 1996 ) data show quite distinct features .",
    "the hcn data give informations on the distributions and dynamical structures of `` dense '' ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) molecular clouds , whereas the co line traces `` less dense '' ( @xmath4 @xmath3 ) clouds . in co ( @xmath0 )",
    "observations , it is difficult to see structures with velocities @xmath5 km s@xmath6 toward the gc region because of the heavy contamination by the disk components which have small line - of - sight velocities .",
    "but in the hcn ( @xmath0 ) line , there is no contamination in this velocity range because there is very little hcn emission from the local disk .",
    "on the other hand , with hcn data alone , we lose important information about certain interesting features of the low - density clouds in the gc such as the high - velocity ( @xmath7 ) components .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1 maps in co and hcn are quite different . for example , the co data show a clear parallelogram structure ( binney et al .",
    "1991 ) which is not seen in the hcn maps .",
    "thus , surveys with high - density and low - density tracers serve us with complementary information on the distribution and kinematics of gc molecular clouds . other molecular lines such as",
    "cs also trace the dense clouds .",
    "however , we consider only hcn observations for dense components because the cs surveys by bally et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and tsuboi et al .",
    "( 1989 ) cover a smaller area than the hcn survey .",
    "we simply note that the cs and hcn data are very similar in overlapping areas .",
    "one of the interesting features of the co and hcn maps includes the existence of clouds with `` forbidden velocities '' ( velocities that differ significantly from what would be observed along a given line - of - sight if the clouds are in purely circular orbits ) .",
    "it would be difficult to explain these non - circular velocity components if the galactic potential is axisymmetric , unless there is a mechanism for generating non - circular motion such as explosive phenomena .",
    "there are direct evidences for a bar in the inner galaxy ( e.g , non - axisymmetric image of the gc region seen from cobe satellite ; blitz et al .",
    "1993 ) as well as somewhat indirect evidences ( e.g , parallelogram structure of co in the @xmath1 map ) deduced from the kinematic behavior of molecular clouds [ see gerhard ( 1995 ) for a review ] .",
    "thus it is desirable to examine the effects of the galactic bar on the distribution and kinematics of molecular clouds .",
    "there have been many hydrodynamic simulations for the study of interstellar medium in the galaxy : sticky particle simulations by schwarz ( 1981 , 1984 ) and habe & ikeuchi ( 1985 ) , smooth fluids simulations by sanders & huntley ( 1976 ) , van albada ( 1985 ) , mulder & liem ( 1986 ) , and athanassoula ( 1992 ) , and smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations by wada & habe ( 1992 ) , friedly & benz ( 1992 ) , and fux & friedly ( 1996 ) .",
    "these simulations have been successful in reproducing gross structures of the interstellar medium and gas motions on global ( a few kpc ) scales , but there has not been much effort in the detailed study of the structures within @xmath81 kpc from the gc . in the present study ,",
    "we concentrate on the kinematic structures in such small region of the gc .",
    "we pay special attention to the different structures revealed by co and hcn observations .",
    "recently , binney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have shown that single - particle orbits in a steady non - axisymmetric potential should provide a reliable guide for the interpretation of kinematic behavior of molecular clouds in the gc region .",
    "they fitted successfully the large non - circular forbidden components with the co parallelogram in the @xmath1 map using @xmath9 orbits .",
    "they also showed that locations of the giant molecular clouds at the gc , such as the sgr b and sgr c , could be explained by the @xmath10 orbits .",
    "however , more realistic calculations including the non - axisymmetric potential as well as the hydrodynamic effects are highly desirable to confirm some of the conclusions drawn from orbit calculations . for such purposes , we carry out numerical simulations using the sph method for the response of molecular clouds in the galaxy with a bar .",
    "we then make detailed comparisons between the observation and simulations to understand the distribution and kinematics of the gc molecular clouds .    in @xmath11 2",
    "we shortly introduce the observational data which will be compared with our simulation results . in @xmath11 3",
    "we describe the model galaxy , model parameters , and the gaseous disk .",
    "the results from the numerical calculations are compared with ones observed in the co and hcn molecular lines in @xmath11 4 . in @xmath11 5",
    "a run of mixture of collisional and collisionless particles , the gas infall phenomenon driven by the perturbation of bar potential , and its related structures are discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in @xmath11 6",
    "the kinematic behavior of the clouds can be studied using @xmath1 maps of molecular emission lines . in fig .",
    "[ co-hcn.map ] , we have shown co and hcn @xmath1 maps .",
    "the co @xmath1 map ( fig .",
    "[ co-hcn.map]a ; bitran s data kindly provided by t.dame ) shows a clean parallelogram structure with a maximum velocity of around 300 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the emission resulting from clouds in the disk component ( from solar neighborhood to near the center ) is seen as a zero velocity ` strip ' in this map .",
    "there are relatively empty regions near @xmath12(@xmath13 ) .",
    "the emission is stronger at positive @xmath14 than negative @xmath14 .",
    "the hcn map ( fig . [ co-hcn.map]b ) is based on the large scale survey carried out by lee ( 1996 ) at the taeduk radio astronomy observatory .",
    "the hcn emission is generally much weaker than the co and it is very strongly skewed toward the positive @xmath14 region .",
    "the hcn map does not show the parallelogram structure seen in the co map .",
    "the forbidden velocity components are much less prominent in the hcn map . in the following numerical study , we try to understand these differences between the co and hcn data .",
    "there is no single numerical method that can describe the evolution of the galaxy since there are many components that react differently .",
    "we have adopted the sph method to study the dynamics of molecular clouds in the galaxy because of its versatility .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galaxy is generated by the stars , gas , and dark matter .",
    "the galactic potential is assumed to be independent of time ( in the frame corotating with the bar ) for simplicity .",
    "the molecular clouds represented by sph particles change with time , and so does the potential generated by the clouds .",
    "however , the total mass contained in this component is a small fraction of the galactic mass and thus can be ignored in the first approximation .",
    "simulations with self - gravity are highly desirable , but they require much better numerical accuracy and computational resources than the simple calculations reported in this paper .      the model galaxy is assumed to be composed of four components : halo , disk , bulge , and bar . we have ignored the central black hole ( eckart & genzel 1996 ) because its influence is limited within about a parsec from the center . our computational resolution is of order of 100 pc and the central black hole would have no significant effect in our simulations .",
    "let s denote @xmath15 as the distance from the gc to any location in the galaxy and @xmath16 as the distance on the disk .",
    "the halo component , which gives rise to the flat rotation curve at large radii , is assumed to have a logarithmic potential , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the halo core radius , and @xmath19 is the constant rotation velocity at large @xmath15 . for the disk component , we adopt freeman s ( 1970 ) exponential disk which has the following form : @xmath20 .",

    "the total disk mass is simply @xmath25 . as for the bulge component",
    ", we have assumed the plummer model to allow a steep outward velocity increase from the gc ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) ; @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a parameter which controls the size of bulge .",
    "the bulges of real galaxies can be better represented by de vaucouleurs @xmath28-law , but we have chosen the plummer model for simplicity . again , our results are not very sensitive to the specific choice of @xmath29 as long as the typical radius where bulge dominates the potential is small .",
    "our models have @xmath30 pc .",
    "the bar is a triaxial component in three dimensions .",
    "however , our simulation is restricted to the two - dimensional disk .",
    "thus we have adopted the following form of the gravitational potential proposed by long & murali ( 1992 ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32}$ ] , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the major and minor axes , respectively . in the above notation ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the coordinates parallel to the long axis and the short axis , respectively .",
    "we have considered four models with bars of different axial ratios of a : b=2:1 , 2.5:1 , 3:1 , and 4:1 .      in our numerical calculations",
    "all physical quantities are given with dimensionless units .",
    "the unit of length in our calculation is chosen to be @xmath3710 kpc .",
    "the total mass of the galaxy within 10 kpc is assumed to be @xmath38 ( caldwell & ostriker 1981 ) .",
    "we have used the following units for time , velocity and angular velocity ;    time : : :    @xmath39 velocity : : :    @xmath40 angular velocity : : :    @xmath41 .    the free parameters in defining the gravitational potential are chosen to satisfy the constraint that the rotation curve of the model galaxy should match the observed one ( fig .",
    "[ rot - vel ] ) .",
    "the observed rotation curve is taken from clemens ( 1985 ) .",
    "the mass of each component is assumed to be @xmath42 , and the disk scale radius @xmath21 is assumed to be 3.4 kpc .",
    "we have considered four different values for @xmath43 : 1/2 , 1/2.5 , 1/3 and 1/4 .",
    "we have varied the axis ratios by changing the minor axis .",
    "the mass of each component has to be varied by small amount with axial ratio in order to best fit the observed rotation curve .",
    "the parameters for the models investigated in this study are summarized in table 1 . the final row in this table designated by `",
    "ub ' denotes parameters of a model without a bar .",
    "the major axis length @xmath33 of the bar , the bar pattern speed @xmath44 and the rotation speed @xmath45 at the galactocentric distance of 10 kpc are fixed at 0.22 ( weiland et al .",
    "1994 ; dwek et al .",
    "1995 ) , 2.731 ( gerhard 1995 ) , and 0.92 ( caldwell & ostriker 1981 ) , respectively .",
    "the adoption of @xmath46 places the cr around at @xmath472.7 kpc , the ilr near @xmath471.2 kpc and the olr close to @xmath48 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ resonance ] ) .",
    "the extent of the exponential disk is much larger than the galactocentric distance of the sun .",
    "however , we have distributed the sph particles within 4 kpc in order to obtain better resolution with a finite number of particles .",
    "the number of particles for our simulations is around 8000 .",
    "the initial resolution length was about 160 pc .",
    "we have used the sph technique which is a lagrangian method that uses a number of particles in order to solve the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this is a versatile technique that can be applied to many three - dimensional problems .",
    "we simply refer readers to the review by monaghan ( 1994 ) for detailed description of the sph method .",
    "the code we used was adopted from j. monaghan .    in order to treat the hydrodynamics accurately",
    ", one needs to solve the the energy equation simultaneously .",
    "however , it is a very difficult task to include energy equation . the simplifying assumption to avoid such",
    "a complexity is to assume isothermality .",
    "the temperature @xmath49 for the sph particles can reach at high value when collision occur ( which is highly supersonic in our cases ) .",
    "the resulting temperature is not a realistic gas temperature , but merely represents the temperature just behind the shock . even though the shock temperature can be fairly high",
    ", the cooling will be faster than any other dynamical processes .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the shock is ` radiative ' or ` isothermal ' .    in our numerical simulations ,",
    "we have fixed the gas temperature at 10,000 k. again , this temperature should be interpreted as the internal energy that is responsible to support the cloud against the gravitational collapse .",
    "giant molecular clouds are known to support themselves mainly through turbulent motions .",
    "the velocity dispersion of about 10 km s@xmath6 found in the molecular clouds roughly corresponds to temperature of 10,000 k. this assumption of constant temperature is based on the work by hernquist ( 1989 ) who showed that the gas temperature can be maintained at @xmath50 k throughout the evolution due to an effective radiative cooling in the shocked gas .",
    "clearly this choice is somewhat arbitrary , but many of the features of our numerical simulations are not sensitive to this temperature as long as the thermal energy is much smaller than the kinetic energy associated with the orbital motion .",
    "the initial randomly distributed velocities were given to the sph particles so that the centrifugal accelerations of the particles were balanced with their gravitational accelerations .",
    "in order to make a test of our numerical code , we have first computed the ub model that does not have a bar , as a reference model . in this model",
    "there is little change in the particle distributions throughout the integrations because most of the particles keep circular orbits even at the end of simulations .    in the models with the bar ( b models ) ,",
    "the orbits of the particles are much perturbed by the rotating bar potential and some noticeable features develop . in fig .",
    "[ gen - fig ] , we show the distribution of sph particles in reference frame at several different epochs for the b4 - 1 model .",
    "a two - armed spiral pattern becomes visible at the early stages of the evolution ( at @xmath51 ) and remains weak to the later stages ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "other prominent features of the b models are the developments of non - circular orbits .",
    "the sph particles near the cr experience large amount of velocity perturbations and eventually undergo dissipation of their orbital energy through hydrodynamic collisions .",
    "the inflow of mass due to this effect makes several interesting structures such as an elliptical outer ring at around @xmath53 kpc , a prominent gas - depletion region between about @xmath54 kpc , and a central concentration of gas within about 1 kpc .",
    "the velocity field of the sph particles at @xmath55 for model b4 - 1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ vel - field ] , where the bar lies along the thick straight line that passes the center .",
    "the thin lines represent the hypothetical lines connecting the center and the observer . in order to compare with the observations ( co and hcn @xmath1 maps ) ,",
    "we have constructed theoretical @xmath1 maps by using this velocity field of sph particles .",
    "the observer is assumed to move along a circular orbit with rotational speed @xmath56 km s@xmath6 at a galactocentric distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "several @xmath1 maps are constructed with different values of @xmath57 which is the angle between the bar and the line - of - sight . a representative @xmath1 map at @xmath58 is shown in fig . [ sph-lv.map ] .",
    "this figure should be compared with the co and hcn data shown in fig .",
    "[ co-hcn.map ] .",
    "we pay attention to features such as the forbidden velocity components and the velocity gradient produced by the central concentration of sph particles close to the gc .",
    "the particles with the negative velocity at the positive longitude or the positive velocity at the negative longitude are those moving along non - circular orbits .",
    "the forbidden components seen at @xmath59 and the sgr a , c , and e complexes also appear in the sph simulations .",
    "however , our sph results are quite different from the co map in fig .",
    "[ co-hcn.map]b .",
    "the co map simply shows much more prominent non - circular components than the simulated results .",
    "sph particles initially on circular motions quickly acquire non - circular velocity components in the early phase , but the hydrodynamic collisions tend to suppress the random velocity .    the steepness of the diagonal feature in fig .",
    "[ sph-lv.map ] ( i.e. , the velocity gradient ) depends on the elongation of the bar . as the bar becomes more elongated , the velocity gradient along the longitude of these concentration tends to be steeper .",
    "factors determining the bar strength are the mass and the axial ratio of the bar .",
    "we assumed the bar mass to be about 5 % of the total mass of the galaxy . among our models with different elongation , the model b4 - 1 ( @xmath60 produces the steepest velocity gradient of central concentration .",
    "since the velocity gradient implied by the hcn data is very steep , the elongation of the bar in our galaxy is likely to be rather large .",
    "the disk component in nearly circular motion appears as a narrow band running from the gc to @xmath61 with velocity width of @xmath62 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the slope of the disk component in the @xmath1 map depends on the extent of how far away we are watching the gaseous material .",
    "if clouds exist all the way to the solar circle , the slope would be nearly zero .",
    "however , if the clouds exist only close to the gc , the lower velocity envelope would appear as a straight line with nonzero slope .",
    "since the gaseous material exists only within 4 kpc in our simulation , a slope is seen in our model @xmath1 map .",
    "the actual disk component seen by the co appears as a strip with nearly zero slope . on the other hand , the hcn @xmath1 map ( fig .",
    "[ co-hcn.map]b ) does not show the disk component .",
    "this means that the hcn clouds are fairly well confined within a small distance from the gc .",
    "the gas - depletion region within the cr shown in fig .",
    "[ vel - field ] appears between the outer elliptical ring and the central concentration in the @xmath1 map of fig .",
    "[ sph-lv.map ] .",
    "this structure matches well with the one at @xmath63 in the co map ( fig .",
    "[ co-hcn.map]a ) . the depletion of particles results from their inflow as they lose orbital energy through hydrodynamic collision .",
    "we discuss this phenomenon in greater detail in @xmath64 .",
    "our models have two important ingredients : a non - axisymmetric potential and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "the non - circular velocity component is induced by the fluctuating potential of the rotating bar .",
    "the hydrodynamic effects generally suppress further developments of non - circular motions . in order to distinguish between these two effects ,",
    "we have made further experiments with the `` best - fitting '' b4 - 1 model by turning off the pressure force which is responsible for the hydrodynamic collisions between the sph particles .",
    "this `` collisionless '' model resulted in the @xmath1 diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ coll - less ] . obviously , the rate of inflow of the gas within the cr is much smaller than that of the sph model , and the ` gas - depletion region ' is not seen in this figure .",
    "the dispersion in velocity is much greater than that of the case with collisional effects ( , the computation including the pressure force ) .",
    "thus , we clearly see that the large fraction of non - circular orbits induced by the potential fluctuation are suppressed by the presence of hydrodynamic collisions . without such collisions ,",
    "the radial velocity of the gas clouds would have covered a much larger area in @xmath1 space .",
    "we have also performed orbit calculations of single particles to try to understand the kinematic structure of the clouds .",
    "the hydrodynamic collisions between molecular clouds tend to destroy non - closed , self - intersecting orbits . in a rotating ,",
    "non - axisymmetric potential , there are several families of closed , non self - intersecting orbits . among them , the @xmath9 and @xmath65 orbits are the most prominent ones ( contopoulos & mertzanides 1977 ) .",
    "these orbits and the resulting @xmath1 traces are shown in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] .",
    "the @xmath1 traces are drawn assuming that the angle between the bar and the line - of - sight is 45@xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath9 orbits shown as solid lines move along the long axis and provide a rather large dispersion in the radial velocities when viewed from the position of the sun unless the line - of - sight coincides with the short axis .",
    "binney et al . ( 1991 ) have shown that the parallelogram structure of co clouds can be generated by the cusped orbit ( the smallest non self - intersecting orbit of contopoulos sequence @xmath9 ) in a simple , non - axisymmetric rotating potential . however ,",
    "in our model the @xmath9 family of orbits is not present among the sph particles .",
    "we have argued that the hcn @xmath1 map is rather similar to our sph simulations .",
    "this can be understood if we assume that the sph particles represent the dense clouds that are formed by hydrodynamic collisions between clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "the collisionless particles can be assumed to represent the less dense clouds that can be traced by the co emission .",
    "this implies that the @xmath9 orbits are easily destroyed by the hydrodynamic collisions .",
    "however , the @xmath10 orbits appear to be more prominent in ` central concentration ' in the central part .",
    "although the @xmath9 orbits do not interact among themselves , there must be collisions between particles with @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbits .    in order to make a more detailed comparison , we have also made another simulation with a mixture of collisionless ( about 10,000 ) and collisional ( about 10,000 ) particles . the resulting @xmath1 diagram in fig .",
    "[ mixture ] successfully reproduces the observed features such as the parallelogram structure , the high - velocity envelopes of @xmath67 km s@xmath6 , the forbidden velocity components of @xmath68 km s@xmath6 at the negative longitude , as well as the structures seen in hcn map .",
    "some of co clouds appearing in the @xmath1 map may be the clouds whose orbits are perturbed by the rotating bar potential , but not experienced by collisions between them .",
    "the fact that the hcn @xmath1 map resembles that of the sph particles while the co @xmath1 map is more like that of the collisionless particles indicates that the dense clouds traced by hcn molecules may be formed by hydrodynamic collisions between co clouds .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath1 map of the ` mixture ' model with observations also indicates that the @xmath69 complex may consist of a spiral arm , the elliptical outer ring , and the collisionless components .",
    "it is also possible that the @xmath70 complex may include @xmath10 family components of the central concentration as well as all components that the @xmath69 complex does .",
    "hence we suggest that the well - known wide line width of these complexes ( e.g. , stark & bania 1986 ; lee 1996 ) may be due to a complex superposition of these several kinds of orbit components along the line - of - sight .",
    "this model also suggests that the clouds in forbidden velocities ( @xmath71 km s@xmath6 ) in @xmath70 , @xmath59 , the sgr a , c , and e complexes possibly originate from the elliptical outer ring components , and/or from infalling spiral components which experienced hydrodynamic collisions , and/or from collisionless components with high velocity .",
    "the inflow toward the gc due to the bar potential is observationally a well - known phenomenon .",
    "some of the star burst activity in barred galaxies are interpreted as a consequence of such an inflow .",
    "the basic mechanism for the inflow is the dissipation of orbital energy of clouds through the hydrodynamic collisions between clouds .",
    "the collision occurs because of the non - circular motions induced by the rotating non - axisymmetric potential of the bar . in our galaxy",
    ", the rate of inflow through the ilr has been suggested to be @xmath72 yr@xmath6 ( gerhard 1992 ) .    for more quantitative analysis",
    ", we calculate how the fraction of gaseous mass within @xmath73 , 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 changes with time , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ gas - frac ] . for the purpose of checking numerical error",
    ", we have also shown the same quantities for a model without a bar in this figure as straight lines .",
    "it clearly shows there is no inflow for all the radii throughout the evolution in the ub model , whereas a significant amount of gas inflow is seen in the models with a bar . within @xmath74 ,",
    "the fraction of gaseous mass is nearly constant throughout the evolution , but it increases noticeably within @xmath75 .    it should be noted that the increase of the gas mass within @xmath76 is much larger than that within any other region . because the inflow within @xmath75 is small , most of the gas inflow must originate from the region between @xmath770.2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the inflow within @xmath73 occurs mildly because our resolution is not good enough within this radius .",
    "the behavior of gas inflow clearly depends on the bar strength in that the amount of gas inflow is greater in models with larger bar axial ratio . the inflowing gas mass through @xmath78",
    "is estimated to be about @xmath79 yr@xmath6 for b models .",
    "these are very similar to that estimated by gerhard ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have shown that the forbidden components could be generated by the perturbation of the bar potential .",
    "it is also possible that the non - circular motions can be generated by other ways such as an explosive event from the galactic center .",
    "however , such non - circular components should be easily dissipated by the cloud collisions .",
    "spontaneous generation of non - circular velocities is required to explain the forbidden velocity components unless we are observing the event at a special epoch .",
    "a rotating bar potential appears to be a plausible source for the generation of the non - circular velocity field .",
    "the forbidden velocity component is suppressed by the hydrodynamic collisions .",
    "the hcn clouds with forbidden velocities are relatively rare .",
    "this is consistent with the collisional hypothesis for the formation of dense clouds .",
    "we also found that the forbidden components appear only when @xmath57 lies between about 20@xmath66 and 50@xmath66 , even though they should be visible at almost all angles of @xmath57 if they were generated only by the perturbation of the bar potential .",
    "therefore comparing the sph simulations with the hcn data gives better constraints on @xmath57 .",
    "we did not take into an account of the finite lifetime of molecular clouds in our calculation .",
    "the lifetime of the giant molecular clouds is known to be be around @xmath80 years ( palla & galli 1997 ) , which is somewhat smaller than a orbital time scale ( @xmath81 years ) of the bar .",
    "it is not clear what is the life - time of the co clouds represented by ` collisionless ' particles in our simulation .",
    "if it is very short , the clouds may not have enough time to acquire non - circular velocity component .",
    "then many clouds would not have enough time to experience collisions before they turn into stars .",
    "however , we still expect that the kinematic structures of the remaining clouds can be similar to our simulated results .",
    "if the dense molecular clouds are formed by cloud collisions , we are selectively seeing the clouds that have undergone collisions .",
    "the co clouds may have extensive non - circular motions from the birth because the gaseous material should have been exposed to the potential generated by rotating bar .",
    "we have also ignored the self - gravity of the clouds . by neglecting the mutual gravitational interactions , we have effectively suppressed the possibility of the dynamical instability .",
    "the lopsided distribution of dense clouds could be due to non - axisymmetric instability , as discussed below .",
    "we will consider this problem in the future investigation .",
    "one of the puzzles regarding the distribution of molecular gas toward the gc region is its lopsidedness : more molecular clouds are seen at the positive @xmath14 than at negative @xmath14 .",
    "the degree of lopsidedness is greater when observed with high - density tracers such as hcn and cs than with low - density tracer such as co ( bally et al .",
    "1987 ; lee 1996 ) .",
    "clearly , our models are unable to reproduce the lopsidedness .",
    "an attempt to explain this phenomenon by perspective effect was not very successful ( binney 1994 ) . the @xmath82 instability may be responsible for the asymmetric distribution of the molecular clouds ( e.g. , yuan 1998 ) .",
    "further studies including the self - gravity of the gaseous component may help to clarify this point .    the activity - related features such as the radio continuum structures vertical to the galactic plane [ see sofue ( 1989 ) for a review ] can not be well explained in the context of our models because our simulations are restricted to the disk .",
    "the extension to three - dimensional model is necessary .",
    "although we have successfully reproduced some important features by using a simple model , many of the important features certainly can be explored with more realistic models .",
    "we have studied response of molecular clouds to a bar potential by conducting a numerical simulation of the galaxy using a sph method to try to understand the distribution and kinematic structures of the gc molecular clouds .",
    "the model galaxy consists of three axisymmetric components ( logarithmic massive halo , exponential disk , and a compact bulge represented by the plummer model ) and one non - axisymmetric bar potential .",
    "there are two physical ingredients in our models : non - axisymmetric potential and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "the bar component tends to generate non - circular velocity component while the hydrodynamical effects tend to suppress it . in order to understand these effects ,",
    "we have made several calculations that include the collisional sph particles only , collisionless particles only , and both .",
    "followings are our results that we conclude from detailed comparisons of these calculations with hcn ( lee 1996 ) and co ( bitran 1987 ) observation data .",
    "\\(1 ) the velocity structures of the sph particles are found to be consistent with ones traced by hcn line which are very dense clouds . however , the @xmath1 diagram of co clouds is quite different from that of our sph results , but more similar to that obtained from the simulations without hydrodynamic collisions .",
    "the @xmath1 diagram of the mixture of the collisional particles ( 60@xmath83 ) and the collisionless particles ( 40@xmath83 ) gives better reproduction of kinematic structures of the gc clouds traced by co line , suggesting that the dense clouds seen in the hcn line are formed by collision between less dense clouds seen in the co line .",
    "\\(2 ) our models give one possible explanation of why the line widths of spectra of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 complexes in the gc are so broad .",
    "the model fitting to the data suggests that the @xmath69 complex may consist of a spiral arm , an elliptical outer ring , and collisionless components , and the @xmath70 complex may include more @xmath10 family components of central concentration as well as all components that the @xmath69 complex does .",
    "hence the well - known wide line width of these complexes may be due to such superposition of many different types of orbit components along the line - of - sight .",
    "\\(3 ) our models also suggest what forbidden components ( @xmath71 km s@xmath6 ) in @xmath70 , @xmath59 , the sgr a , c , and e complexes look like .",
    "these can possibly originate from the elliptical outer ring components , and/or from the infalling spiral components which experienced hydrodynamic collision , and/or from collisionless components with high velocity .",
    "we also found that forbidden components originating from the hydrodynamic collisions are well reproduced when @xmath57 lies between about @xmath84 .",
    "however , the forbidden components originating from only the perturbation of the bar potential are seen from all viewing angles .",
    "the relative rareness of the forbidden velocity components in the hcn clouds , compared with those in co clouds , may indicate that the hcn clouds are suppressed by the hydrodynamic collisions to have lower velocity dispersions .",
    "\\(4 ) some features such as the lopsidedness in distribution of molecular clouds to the positive longitude , and activity - related ones as radio continuum structures vertical to the galactic plane are not explained by our simple two - dimensional models .",
    "more realistic models which include the third dimension , self - gravity of interstellar clouds , and so on will be necessary to study these phenomena .",
