    "two - tier femtocell networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twotiergnric ] ) are in the process of being deployed to improve cellular capacity @xcite .",
    "a femtocell serves as a small range data access point situated around high user density hot - spots serving stationary or low - mobility users .",
    "examples of femtocells include residential areas with home lan access points , which are deployed by end users and urban hot - spot data access points .",
    "a femtocell is modeled as consisting of a randomly distributed population of actively transmitting users . the femtocell radio range ( @xmath0 meters )",
    "is much smaller than the macrocell radius ( @xmath1 meters ) @xcite .",
    "users transmitting to femtocells experience superior signal reception and lower their transmit power , consequently prolonging battery life .",
    "the implication is that femtocell users cause less interference to neighboring femtocells and other macrocell users .",
    "additionally , a two - tier network offsets the burden on the macrocell bs , provided femtocells are judiciously placed in traffic hot - spots , improving network capacity and qos .    [ !",
    "h ]        because of the scarce availability of spectrum and for reasons of flexible deployment , it may be easier for cellular operators to implement a two - tier network by sharing spectrum , rather than splitting spectrum between tiers .",
    "the focus of this work is to answer the following questions :    * what is the two - tier uplink capacity in a typical macrocell with randomly scattered hotspots , assuming a randomly distributed population of actively transmitting users per femtocell ? *",
    "is it possible to accurately characterize the statistics of the cross - tier interference ?",
    "what is the effect of the femtocell hotspot density , macrocell - femtocell power ratio and femtocell size ?",
    "* how much benefit is accrued by interference avoidance using antenna sectoring and time hopping in cdma transmission ? what is the impact of using a femtocell exclusion region and a tier selection policy for femtocell handoff ?    by addressing these questions ,",
    "our work augments existing research on capacity analysis and interference mitigation in two - tier networks .",
    "we show that creating a suitable infrastructure for curbing cross - tier interference can actually increase the uplink capacity for a shared spectrum network .      from a physical layer viewpoint , prior research",
    "has mainly focused on analyzing the uplink capacity , assuming either a single microcell or multiple regularly spaced microcells in a macrocell site .",
    "this model has assumed significance for its analytical tractability , nonetheless , it has limited applicability owing to the inherent variability in microcell locations in realistic scenarios .",
    "the ideas presented in this paper are most closely related to the work by kishore _",
    "et al . _ the downlink cellular capacity of a two - tier network is derived in @xcite .",
    "the results show that the cellular user capacity is limited by uplink performance for both slow and fast power control . in @xcite , the ocs for a two - tier network",
    "are derived for different tier - selection schemes , assuming an arbitrarily placed microcell .",
    "further work by the same author @xcite extended the framework to multiple microcells embedded inside multiple macrocells .",
    "the cross - tier interference is approximated by its average and cross - tier microcell to microcell interference is ignored .",
    "the resulting analysis is shown to be accurate only up to 8 microcells per macrocell .",
    "our results , on the other hand , are accurate over a wide range of femtocell densities , without approximating the interference statistics .",
    "related work includes @xcite , which discusses the benefits of having a tilted antenna radiation pattern and macrocell - microcell power ratio control . in @xcite ,",
    "a regular network comprising a large hexagonal macrocell and smaller hexagonal microcells is considered . citing near far effects , the authors conclude that it is more practical to split the rf spectrum between each tier .",
    "the reason being that the loss in trunking efficiency by splitting the spectrum is lower than the increase in outage probability in a shared spectrum two - tier network .",
    "our paper , in contrast , shows a higher user capacity for a shared spectrum network by enforcing _",
    "higher spatial reuse _ through small femtocells and _ interference avoidance _ by way of antenna sectoring and time hopped cdma ( th - cdma ) in each tier .",
    "finally , from a network perspective , joseph _ et al . _ @xcite study impact of user behavior , load balancing and different pricing schemes for interoperability between wi - fi hotspots and cellular networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the design of a multitiered wireless network with poisson call arrivals is formulated as an constrained optimization problem , and the results highlight the economic benefits of a two - tier network infrastructure : increased stability in system cost and a more gradual performance degradation as users are added .",
    "this paper employs a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the _ random _ spatial distribution of users / femtocells , in contrast to prior work @xcite .",
    "hotspot locations are likely to vary from one cellsite to another , and be opportunistic rather than planned : therefore a capacity analysis that embraces instead of neglecting randomness will naturally provide more accurate results and more plausible insights .",
    "to model the user / hotspot locations , the paper assumes that the macrocell users and femtocell bs are randomly distributed as a homogeneous spatial poisson point process ( sppp ) ( see @xcite for background , prior works include @xcite ) .",
    "the three key contributions in our paper are summarized below .",
    "first , a novel outage probability analysis is presented , accounting for cellular geometry , cross - tier interference and shadowing effects .",
    "we derive tight lower bounds on statistics of macrocell interference at any femtocell hotspot bs along the hexagonal axis .",
    "next , assuming small femtocell sizes , a poisson - gaussian model for macrocell interference and alpha - stable distribution for cross - tier femtocell interference is shown to accurately capture the statistics at the macrocell bs . in the analysis ,",
    "outage events are explicitly modeled rather than considering average interference as in @xcite . for doing so",
    ", the properties of poisson shot - noise processes ( snp)@xcite and poisson void probabilities @xcite are used for deriving the uplink outage probabilities .",
    "second , robust interference avoidance is shown to enable two - tier networks with universal frequency reuse to achieve higher user capacity , relative to splitting the spectrum across tiers . with interference avoidance ,",
    "an equitable distribution of users between tier 1 and tier 2 networks is shown to be achieved with an _ order - wise difference _ in the ratio of their received powers . even considering the worst case cross - tier interference at a corner femtocell",
    ", results for moderately loaded cellular networks reveal that interference avoidance provides a @xmath2x increase in the mean number of femtocells over split spectrum two - tier networks .",
    "third , additional interference avoidance using a combination of femtocell exclusion and tier selection based femtocell handoff offers modest improvements in the network ocs .",
    "this suggests that at least for small femtocell sizes , time hopping and antenna sectoring offer the largest gains in user capacity for shared spectrum two - tier networks .",
    "denote @xmath3 as the interior of a reference hexagonal macrocell @xmath4 of radius @xmath5 .",
    "the tier 1 network consists of low density cellular users that are communicating with the central bs in each cellsite .",
    "the cellular users are distributed on @xmath6 according to a homogeneous sppp @xmath7 of intensity @xmath8 .",
    "the overlaid tier 2 network containing the femtocell bs s forms a homogeneous sppp is homogeneous . ]",
    "@xmath9 with intensity @xmath10 .",
    "each femtocell hotspot includes a poisson distributed population of actively transmitting users with mean @xmath11 in a circular coverage area of radius @xmath12 . to maximize user capacity per cellsite , it is desirable to have @xmath13 ; as will be shown , cross - tier interference at a macrocell bs limits @xmath10 for a given @xmath8 . defining @xmath14 as the area of the hexagonal region @xmath15 , the mean number of macrocell users and femtocell bs s per cellsite are given as @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "table [ tbl : sysprms ] shows a summary of important parameters and typical values for them , which are used later in numerical simulations .",
    "users in each tier employ ds - cdma with processing gain @xmath18 .",
    "uplink power control adjusts for propagation losses and log - normal shadowing , which is standard in contemporary cdma networks .",
    "the macrocell and femtocell receive powers are denoted as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "any power control errors @xcite and short - term fading effects are ignored for analytical convenience .",
    "we affirm this assumption as reasonable , especially in a wideband system with significant frequency diversity and robust reception ( through rake receiver , coding and interleaving ) .",
    "suppose that the cdma period @xmath21 is divided into @xmath22 hopping slots , each of duration @xmath23 .",
    "every macrocell user and femtocell ( all active users within a femtocell transmit in the same hopping slot ) independently choose to transmit over any one slot , and remain silent over the remaining @xmath24 slots .",
    "the resulting intra- and cross - tier interference are `` thinned '' by a factor of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "using th - cdma , users in each tier effectively sacrifice a factor @xmath22 of their processing gain , but benefit by thinning the interfering field by the same factor .",
    "we further assume sectorized antenna reception in both the macrocell and femtocell bs , with antenna alignment angle @xmath25 and sector width equaling @xmath26 .",
    "while antenna sectoring is a common feature at the macrocell bs in practical cellular systems , this paper proposes to use sectorized antennas at femtocell bs s as well .",
    "the reason is that the cross - tier interference caused by nearby cellular users can lead to unacceptable outage performance over the femtocell uplink ; this motivates the need for directed femtocell antennas .",
