    "the ubiquitous rashba spin - orbit coupling , found in two - dimensional electron systems and topological insulators ( tis ) , is equivalent to a non - abelian su(2 ) `` magnetic '' field without dynamics @xcite",
    ". this effective `` magnetic '' field can be quite strong @xcite and responsible for topologically protected edge states in two - dimensional tis @xcite  just as the ordinary u(1 ) magnetic field is responsible for edge states in quantum hall systems .",
    "here we examine another possible analogy between u(1 ) and su(2 ) fields : can a two - dimensional superconductor subjected to the rashba spin - orbit coupling exhibit a vortex lattice like type - ii superconductors in magnetic fields ?",
    "spin - orbit - coupled superfluids have been studied in the context of cold atoms , motivated by the experimental progress in subjecting trapped two - component bosonic atoms to artificial gauge fields @xcite .",
    "a genuine rashba spin - orbit coupling has not been created yet , but new technologies based on atom chips could realize it in the foreseeable future .",
    "theoretical studies have mostly scrutinized the rashba spin - orbit - coupled condensates of bosons that can move freely through the trap .",
    "mean - field calculations favor `` plane wave '' and `` standing wave '' condensates formed at finite wavevectors @xcite , but quantum fluctuations may give rise to more unconventional states , perhaps even with fractional quasiparticles @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a two - dimensional lattice model of attractively interacting fermions that can form a paired spin - triplet superfluid in the presence of a rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the model describes a two - dimensional ti placed in contact with a conventional superconductor @xcite , but it can be reformulated to describe triplet exciton pairing among repulsively interacting electrons .",
    "the surface of a kondo ti smb@xmath0 can also exhibit instabilities @xcite that are addressed by this model .",
    "the choice of a lattice rather than a continuum model makes vortex arrays more competitive to the `` plane wave '' and `` standing wave '' states at the mean - field level .",
    "indeed , we find condensates with a vortex lattice in a broad parameter regime when vortex cores of small size reside inside lattice plaquettes .",
    "the presented results follow from a numerical mean - field calculation at zero temperature .",
    "quantum fluctuations enhanced by the low spatial dimensionality can give rise to vortex liquids .    the significance or our results",
    "is two - fold .",
    "first , the discovered vortex lattice is a novel state of matter  an abrikosov - type array of su(2 ) topological defects that features spin - supercurrent loops and respects the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry .",
    "the present study demonstrates a realistic microscopic model where such a vortex state can be stable . this is a different yet remarkably similar vortex array to the one identified by the landau - ginzburg analysis @xcite as a prominent metastable state in the continuum limit . related but different states have been seen in a few studies of two - component interacting particles with spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "second , the quantum melting of a vortex lattice can produce an incompressible quantum liquid @xcite whose excitations have fractional exchange statistics .",
    "this was numerically demonstrated in the context of rotating bosonic atoms , where the quantum melting of a u(1 ) abrikosov lattice yields a fractional quantum hall state @xcite .",
    "similar physics is expected in the present su(2 ) system @xcite .",
    "both cold atom gases and quantum well heterostructures enable experimental manipulation of the quantum state .",
    "destabilizing an existing vortex lattice at low temperatures by almost any means would allow experimental access to a fractional quantum liquid @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian fractional states created by the su(2 ) rashba flux could be useful for quantum computing .",
    "this work identifies the precise nature of the su(2 ) vortices , which informs about the fractional statistics of quasiparticles in the corresponding vortex liquids @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ seca ] introduces the model , discusses its features and relates it to realistic physical systems .",
    "section [ secb ] presents the main results ",
    "the mean - field phase diagram of su(2 ) vortex states and other competing orders .",
    "section [ secc ] qualitatively analyzes fluctuation effects , and explains why incompressible quantum liquids with fractional excitations should also exist in the phase diagram of this model .",
    "the main discussion ends with conclusions in section [ secconcl ] .",
    "certain special subjects and various technical details are discussed in appendices .",
    "the model we study is given by the imaginary - time path integral @xmath1 expressed in terms of the four - component fermion ( grassmann ) spinors @xmath2 and three - component bosonic ( complex ) spinors @xmath3 .",
    "these fields live on a square lattice whose sites are labeled by @xmath4 . the fermions @xmath5 have spin @xmath6 , and another two - state degree of freedom @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is motivated by the hamiltonian representation of an ultra - thin ti film @xcite .",
    "a thick ti slab hosts protected helical dirac - metal states on its top ( @xmath8 ) and bottom ( @xmath9 ) surfaces @xcite , with opposite helicity of spin - momentum locking .",
    "when these surfaces are brought close together in a film , the dirac spectrum acquires a gap through inter - surface tunneling ( @xmath10 ) , but the low - energy quasiparticles retain the @xmath11 degree of freedom associated with their surface belonging .",
    "the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath12 describes fermion hopping on the tight - binding square lattice , in the presence of a static su(2 ) gauge field defined on lattice links : @xmath13 this gauge field , written in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath14 that couple to spin , implements the rashba spin - orbit coupling of strength @xmath15 .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath16 operate on the `` surface index '' @xmath11 .",
    "the fermions su(2 ) charge @xmath17 depends on the surface they visit , and the @xmath18 term directly describes inter - surface tunneling that creates a bandgap .",
    "the fermion density is controlled by the chemical potential @xmath19 in our formalism .",
    "interestingly , the 100 crystal surface of a kondo ti smb@xmath0 has similar features .",
    "it hosts three helical fermi pockets in the vicinity of @xmath20 , x and y points of the surface s 1@xmath21 brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 pocket has the opposite helicity of spin - momentum locking than portions of the x and y pockets @xcite .",
    "collective excitations seen by neutron scattering in smb@xmath0 are precisely poised to couple these pockets in either cooper or exciton channels @xcite .",
    "any coupling between the pockets of opposite helicity can lead to triplet pairing of the kind we investigate in this paper .",
    "the su(2 ) flux @xmath22 of ( [ gaugefield ] ) on a square plaquette , with corners @xmath23 enumerated in a clockwise sense , can be defined as a matrix by : @xmath24 depending on which of the four corners is labeled by @xmath25 , one finds @xmath26 with four different combinations of @xmath27 signs .",
    "the leading order term @xmath28 in the limit of small @xmath15 is finite and independent of the exact path around a plaquette ; this becomes the `` magnetic '' yang - mills flux @xmath29 in the equivalent continuum - limit single - particle hamiltonian : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , using the units in which @xmath36 and the lattice constant are equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath22 are su(2 ) gauge - invariant and their finite values lead to an aharonov - bohm effect just like the analogous u(1 ) magnetic field , even though @xmath37 due to the tr symmetry .",
    "interactions among the fermions are generated by a hubbard - stratonovich field , the @xmath38 bosonic spinor @xmath3 : @xmath39 this is the part of the most general decoupling of short range attraction that leads to cooper pairing in spin - triplet channels @xcite .",
    "the remaining part , responsible for singlet pairing , is discussed in the appendix and otherwise neglected  singlets are completely suppressed at the mean - field level in the portion of the phase diagram that we analyze , and , more importantly , they are impaired by spin - orbit su(2 ) neutrality .",
    "triplet cooper pairs are able to gain energy from the rashba spin - orbit coupling in proportion to the momentum they carry @xcite .",
    "the model ( [ model ] ) is invariant under tr and has the full point - group symmetry of the square lattice .",
    "the only continuous symmetry of the model for generic @xmath15 is the u(1 ) symmetry responsible for charge conservation . this symmetry is spontaneously broken in a superfluid state .",
    "however , the continuous symmetry group is larger if @xmath40 , @xmath41 . at @xmath42 , the spin `` up '' and `` down '' states",
    "are decoupled , so one can apply an independent global u(1 ) transformation on each spin projection . at @xmath43 , the nearest - neighbor hopping terms in ( [ h0 ] )",
    "reduce to @xmath44 , which allows the following sublattice - dependent symmetry transformations on a bipartite lattice : @xmath45 this is a double global u(1 ) transformation specified by two angles @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 indicate the lattice sites belonging to one or the other sublattice .",
    "all properties of the model are periodic under @xmath49 , while the change @xmath50 is equivalent to changing the sign of @xmath51 .",
    "the spectrum is invariant under @xmath52 , since this corresponds to the lattice inversion through a point ( without affecting spin ) .      in this paper",
    "we analyze the zero - temperature phase diagram of the model ( [ model ] ) , beginning with the mean - field approximation .",
    "we consider various spatially dependent but static order parameters @xmath53 , and search for the one that minimizes the ground state energy at any given values of @xmath54 , etc @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the usual self - consistent solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for a superconductor .",
    "we assume that the order parameter @xmath3 belongs to one of these categories :    1 .",
    "spatially periodic with a unit - cell of @xmath55 sites : freely vary @xmath56 at every site of the unit - cell ; 2 .",
    "commensurate pair - density wave ( pdw ) at a wavevector @xmath57 : vary @xmath58 and the fourier amplitudes of @xmath3 ; 3 .   incommensurate plane wave state ( pws ) at a wavevector @xmath57 : vary @xmath58 and the amplitude of @xmath3 .",
    "the first category is the most general one among all periodic states , but computationally demanding if the unit - cell is large .",
    "for example , we need 12 complex numbers to specify a periodic state with a @xmath59 unit - cell .",
    "the second category is a subset of the first category , but faster to compute .",
    "the pdw order parameter is restricted to the form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the integer - valued coordinates of the lattice site @xmath4 , and @xmath62 is a commensurate wavevector in the first brillouin zone ( i.e. there is an integer @xmath63 such that @xmath64 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) .",
    "it takes 6 complex numbers to specify the two triplet amplitudes @xmath65 , and another two rational numbers to specify @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the third category captures the plane wave subset of all category-2 states : @xmath66 it takes 3 complex numbers to specify the amplitude @xmath67 , and two real numbers to specify @xmath62 .",
    "a plane - wave state can be handled even when it is incommensurate , since it respects the lattice translation symmetries up to a global gauge transformation . within each of these categories ,",
    "we construct the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian and diagonalize it to determine the superfluid mean - field ground state .",
    "then , we vary all the quantities that specify the order parameter in its category until we find a local minimum of the ground state energy at any point in the phase diagram . at the end ,",
    "the absolute ground state energies in all categories are compared to identify the best order parameter .",
    "a more technical discussion of this procedure and its accuracy can be found in the appendix .",
    "0.03 in   0.03 in     0.03 in   0.03 in     0.03 in   0.03 in     the main results are illustrated in fig.[phdiag1 ] .",
    "this is the phase diagram of non - trivial superfluid states that take advantage of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath15 , plotted as a function of the two interaction couplings @xmath68 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath69 is kept in the middle of the bandgap created by @xmath70 , but interactions are strong enough to cause pairing .",
    "the first striking feature is the existence of several competing orders that reflect the frustrated dynamics .",
    "frustration is created by the competition between the lattice constant ( equal to @xmath25 in our units ) , the su(2 ) `` magnetic '' length ( @xmath71 ) , and the pairing coherence length .",
    "the discovered orders have very similar energies , and differ by no more than @xmath72 of the absolute energy value in many scrutinized parts of the phase diagram .",
    "the achieved absolute error of any calculated energy is much smaller than the energy differences between the found states .",
    "the line @xmath73 separates two different regimes . for @xmath74 , the symmetric triplet component @xmath75 of the order parameter costs less energy than the spinful components @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the ensuing @xmath75 condensates are found to be uniform and with completely suppressed @xmath78",
    "conversely , the region @xmath79 hosts condensates dominated by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , typically with @xmath80 .",
    "the phase transition between the two types of condensates is first order within numerical resolution .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath80 when @xmath79 explains the tendency of the other phase boundaries to be vertical ( the quasiparticles end up decoupled from @xmath81 in the mean - field approximation , so the phase boundaries do not depend on @xmath81 ) .",
    "the region @xmath79 with @xmath82 hosts tr - invariant vortex lattice condensates at @xmath83 .",
    "the appearance of dense vortex lattices is related to the large su(2 ) flux ( [ flux ] ) , maximized at @xmath84 .",
    "a tr - invariant vortex lattice needs both @xmath85 and @xmath86 order parameter components to establish a pattern of spin currents that gain energy through the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it is , then , natural that vortex states live only in the @xmath79 regions .",
    "the vortex lattice states were found by the category-1 search using the minimal unit - cell of @xmath87 sites .",
    "their order parameter , shown in fig.[vl - op ] , is tr - invariant and features a periodic structure of spin currents on lattice links : @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) are spin projection matrices in the @xmath38 representation .",
    "partial understanding of this state follows from the landau - ginzburg theory of two - dimensional @xmath38 superfluids with rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite , which predicts that similar checkerboard vortices of @xmath91 spin - currents are metastable . in the continuum",
    "landau - ginzburg picture , the spin - orbit energy is actually gained through `` helical '' spin currents @xmath92  the pattern of @xmath92 becomes singular and then drives the appearance of @xmath91 spin - current vortices .",
    "however , in the present calculation , @xmath80 renders @xmath93 in the vortex state , so the spin - orbit energy is gained by an intrinsically lattice mechanism . by gauge symmetry",
    "@xcite , the triplets are effectively coupled to the su(2 ) gauge field : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is of the same kind as ( [ gaugefield ] ) but constructed with the @xmath38 spin operators @xmath89 instead of the @xmath96 su(2 ) generators @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( the summation over repeated upper indices is implied ) .",
    "the compact form of this coupling on the lattice has an additional term in the @xmath38 representation involving bond scalars : @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 are symmetric in both lower and upper indices . only @xmath102 and @xmath103 couple to the gauge field ( [ gaugefield ] ) , but this is enough to generate a lattice pattern shown in fig.[vl - op ] , which breaks lattice translation and rotation symmetries .",
    "this is ultimately responsible for the spin - orbit energy gain and the stability of the @xmath91 vortex lattice .",
    "quantum fluctuations inevitably lower the average density of singularities by vortex - antivortex annihilations and make room for vortex motion on the lattice , but can not remove all singularities because that would produce a higher - energy pair - density - wave condensate",
    ".    0.2 in    0.08 in    the main competitors to the tr - invariant vortex lattices are various pair - density waves ( pdws ) . all",
    "found pdw states have ordering wavevectors along a lattice direction , e.g. @xmath104 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath105 tends to grow with the spin - orbit coupling @xmath15 as expected .",
    "however , the lattice commensuration effects introduce large oscillations of the pdw energy @xmath106 as a function of @xmath105 at sufficiently large values of @xmath15 , as shown in fig.[qvect ] .",
    "the largest pdw energy dips are often found at @xmath107 for @xmath108 near favorable values of @xmath15 .",
    "the continuum limit is approached when @xmath15 is small and the ordering wavevector of the lowest - energy pdw is sufficiently small to be in the smooth ( non - oscillatory ) region of @xmath106 . among all these pdw states ,",
    "the only one that ever wins as a mean - field ground state is the tr - invariant order at @xmath109 , seen for @xmath110 .",
    "the next strongest pdw is also tr - invariant at large @xmath15 and @xmath111 , but it never wins .",
    "all other prominent pdws found by category-2 calculations break the tr symmetry . among the category-3 results , only the states at @xmath112 ( small @xmath15 ) and @xmath113 ( large @xmath15 )",
    "can minimize energy , but not enough to win as ground states ; still , only such pws can be tr - invariant , so the states with tr symmetry consistently have lower energy than those that break it .",
    "0.15 in    a separate category-1 calculation discovered additional metastable tr - invariant vortex lattices with a @xmath114 unit - cell , in the range @xmath115 where the @xmath116 pdw states are stable .",
    "the most prominent vortex pattern is the same checkerboard as before , but with a twice larger spatial separation between vortices shown in fig.[vl2-op ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the category-1 numerics fairly consistently found this particular type of local energy minimum instead of the global pdw minimum .",
    "note that the explored phase - space was very large , since @xmath117 real quantities were needed to represent the order parameter on a @xmath114 unit - cell .",
    "in contrast , only @xmath118 real numbers are needed to specify the pdw order parameter of the true ground state discovered by the category-2 calculation .",
    "this probably indicates that vortex lattices have larger entropy ( shallower and broader energy minimum ) than the true pdw ground state .",
    "quantum fluctuations beyond the mean - field approximation are expected to energetically enhance the states with larger entropy .    in the remaining scrutinized region @xmath119 ,",
    "the lowest energy condensates are found to be uniform at all @xmath68 .",
    "even category-2,3 calculations settled for uniform states when @xmath120 , despite having freedom to access smaller and incommensurate wavevectors .",
    "this is a consequence of being in the strong - coupling limit , with interaction energy scales @xmath121 exceeding the bandgap @xmath10 .",
    "it was necessary to work in this limit in order to numerically resolve the tiny energy differences between various competing states ( see appendix ) , but the price to pay was a strong suppression of either @xmath75 or @xmath122 order parameter components in any given phase ( interactions compete for electrons to form pairs so the dominant interaction decides the pairing channel , in agreement with the first order transition at @xmath73 ) .",
    "consequently , energy gain from the spin - orbit coupling requires finite bond scalars @xmath123 ( [ bondscalars ] ) when @xmath80 .",
    "orders of @xmath123 are hard to arrange at larger wavevectors when @xmath15 becomes smaller , and their spin - orbit energy scales as @xmath124 .",
    "seeing finite - momentum ordering at smaller @xmath15 is probably possible only in the weaker coupling limit , which is not accessible with the current numerics . if interactions are not too strong , then the spin - orbit energy gain proportional to @xmath15 in ( [ efftheory ] ) can be sufficient to overcome the tendency of interactions to suppress @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting states can have finite helical spin - currents @xmath92 , and perhaps establish the vortex arrays envisioned in the landau - ginzburg analysis .",
    "the system studied here is two - dimensional , so one can anticipate significant corrections to the mean - field phase diagram .",
    "the continuous u(1 ) symmetry associated with superfluidity can be broken only at @xmath125 , while it gives way to algebraic correlations at low @xmath126 .",
    "all other symmetries of the model are discrete , and hence remain broken at low @xmath126 .    at special values @xmath127 of the spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the model ( [ model ] ) has another continuous symmetry .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is absent if @xmath63 is even , so the corresponding ground - states are trivially uniform .",
    "however , the condensates at odd @xmath63 break the lattice translation symmetry , generally with a @xmath87 unit - cell .",
    "the @xmath87 vortex state that wins at @xmath128 becomes degenerate with the @xmath129 pws and infinitely many other states when @xmath130 .",
    "this follows from the symmetry ( [ sym2 ] ) , which allows free global rotations of the staggered @xmath131 pattern from fig.[vl - op](b ) in the opposite directions @xmath132 on the sublattices a and b. since ( [ sym2 ] ) is a continuous symmetry at @xmath130 , the degenerate condensates ( e.g. vortex lattice and pws ) can be long - range ordered only at @xmath125 and become algebraically correlated at low finite temperatures .",
    "note that this special symmetry is unrealistic because it requires the absence of next - nearest and further - neighbor hopping in the model .",
    "the mean - field energy advantage of the vortex lattice over its related pws gradually disappears as @xmath133 . since the related pws state is obtained by annihilating all singularities of the vortex lattice",
    ", one may expect prominent local quantum fluctuations that annihilate and re - create vortex - antivortex pairs when @xmath15 is close to @xmath134 .",
    "the annihilations reduce the average density of vortices , and hence create room for vortex motion on the lattice .",
    "one possible outcome is the condensation of vortices , which by duality leads to a mott insulator @xcite .",
    "however , if vortices fail to condense due to their large density , still comparable to the density of particles , then a melted vortex lattice is an incompressible quantum liquid with topological order  analogous to fractional quantum hall states , but without tr symmetry breaking and quantized spin - hall response @xcite .",
    "the crystal lattice helps to pin the vortices , so a quantum phase transition between the vortex array condensate and a band - insulator can be of 2nd order .",
    "the _ mean - field _ phase diagram features precisely such a transition when the intrinsic fermion bandgap @xmath10 becomes sufficiently large ( comparable to the pairing energy scale ) . if vortices must rely only on mutual interactions to establish a long - range positional order , then a quantum lindemann criterion @xcite suggests that the mentioned 2nd order transition must be preempted by a 1st order quantum melting of the vortex array .",
    "such melting occurs because the kinetic energy cost of localizing vortices exceeds the potential energy cost of deforming the vortex array when the order parameter amplitude becomes sufficiently small . for this reason",
    ", we expect that the actual phase diagram contains an intermediate vortex liquid phase between a vortex lattice condensate and a band - insulator .",
    "obviously , more analysis going beyond the mean - field approximation is needed to establish the accurate phase diagram of this two - dimensional system .",
    "however , the mean - field approximation is sufficient to reveal the existence of vortex ground states in the phase diagram of certain microscopic models like ( [ model ] ) , which ultimately could be either crystalline or liquid .",
    "it is also adequate for establishing or confirming the predicted structure of vortices on the lattice , i.e. the patterns of charge and spin currents .",
    "the latter is a very useful information for anticipating the possible kinds of fractional quasiparticle statistics in putative incompressible vortex liquids .",
    "field - theoretical arguments generally point to a particle - flux attachment in incompressible quantum liquids @xcite , so the non - trivial exchange statistics of quasiparticle excitations follows from the aharonov - bohm phase that one particle acquires on its path around the flux quanta attached to another quasiparticle .",
    "this simple principle may need to be combined with some deeper understanding of vortex dynamics in order to classify the possible topological orders in this system .",
    "we studied the mean - field phase diagram of a simple two - dimensional model of attractively interacting fermions on the square lattice . the fermions experience a strong rashba spin - orbit coupling in the manner characteristic for two - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "we discovered that a tr - invariant dense array of vortices has the lowest energy at the mean - field level among many competing orders in a large section of the phase diagram .",
    "this state is an analogue of the abrikosov vortex lattice for the particular type of the su(2 ) yang - mills flux that realizes the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "other competing orders include pair - density waves and plane - wave states , some of which break the tr - symmetry .",
    "the energy competition between these states is fierce , so we expect that quantum and thermal fluctuations can easily destabilize some orders in favor of incompressible quantum liquids .    it should be pointed out that much of the observed phase diagram features are not universal .",
    "the phase transitions between the found competing orders are 1st order , and hence model - dependent .",
    "a somewhat different model may suppress or enhance the vortex states . sorting out which microscopic details are favorable to vortex states is not a goal of the present work , and is probably not worth pursuing at present when correlated two - dimensional tis are not experimentally available .",
    "however , our model is the simplest description of the physics that can be realistically expected in interacting ti quantum wells , on the boundaries of kondo tis , or engineered with cold atoms . in that sense ,",

    "blue colors are pdw states with non - zero order parameter amplitudes at two physically different commensurate wavevectors .",
    "hence , a pdw state breaks translation symmetry .",
    "if a blue block is accompanied by an arrow , then the two wavevectors are @xmath58 and @xmath152 ( and not high - symmetry ones in the 1st brillouin zone ) .",
    "red colors are pws states with a non - zero amplitude at a single wavevector @xmath58 ( which can be a non - zero high - symmetry wavevector ) . a pws respects translation symmetry up to a global u(1 ) gauge transformation .",
    "light purple represents a conventional uniform superfluid condensed at @xmath153 , and white is a band - insulator with a vanishing order parameter .",
    "regions with spontaneous magnetization are painted with a lighter color , but follow the same color scheme .",
    "all states with spontaneous tr symmetry breaking are separated by a pair of black lines , where the thinner line faces the tr - invariant state .",
    "the size of blocks reveals the resolution at which the phase diagram was scanned .    the dense vortex array ( fig.[vl - op ] ) discovered by the category-1 calculation",
    "can be regarded as a special kind of pdw states .",
    "its lattice fourier transform has finite amplitudes only at the wavevectors @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the metastable vortex array in a @xmath114 unit - cell ( fig.[vl2-op ] ) has equal finite fourier amplitudes at the wavevectors @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the qualitative distinction from the conventional pdw states is made primarily by the presence of circulating currents .",
    "the vorticity of such currents is counted by first extrapolating the order parameter to real - valued coordinates , and then measuring the winding number of its resulting smoothly varying phase on the continuous paths around lattice plaquettes .",
    "this particular interpretation of vorticity in the _ lattice _ order parameter ( whose phase may jump from one site to another ) is somewhat arbitrary , but the pattern of circulating currents is physically measurable and imprints an aharonov - bohm phase on any degree of freedom that couples to it .",
    "the three category calculations carry out the same numerical procedure , and share the same code for common tasks .",
    "they mainly differ by the manner they define and handle the order parameter .",
    "each type of the order parameter requires its own representation of the bogoliubov de - gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian for quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the category-1 search specifies the order parameter on a real - space unit - cell of @xmath55 sites .",
    "both @xmath158 and @xmath159 are fixed before the search .",
    "the bdg hamiltonian is represented in the bloch - state basis corresponding to this unit - cell , while the unit - cell internals are handled in real - space .",
    "the category-2 search specifies its order parameter by fourier triplet amplitudes at the commensurate wavevectors @xmath58 and @xmath160 ( which may be physically the same if @xmath58 is a high - symmetry wavevector ) .",
    "its bdg hamiltonian is also represented in momentum space , using the largest reduced 1st brillouin zone allowed by @xmath58 .",
    "the category-3 bdg hamiltonian is the simplest and structurally similar to that constructed for uniform condensates in the momentum space ( pairing occurs between two fermions at momenta displaced by @xmath58 ) .",
    "the technical details of these bdg hamiltonians are presented in the next section .",
    "once a bdg hamiltonian is constructed , all three category searches diagonalize it and then obtain the energy of the many - body system ( formally non - interacting after the mean - field approximation ) by integrating out the single - particle bdg spectrum up to the fermi energy @xmath19 in the appropriately reduced 1st brillouin zone . since the model has well - defined cut - offs , this numerical integration is the only source of errors in the calculations of energy .",
    "the integration employs gauss - legendre integration formulas , based on sampling the integrated functions at a set of discrete points in the 1st brillouin zone ; the sampled function is interpolated by a polynomial that can be integrated out exactly .",
    "one controls the absolute error of the calculated energy by the number @xmath161 of sampled points per spatial dimension in the 1st brillouin zone ( 1bz ) , as shown in fig.[errors ] .",
    "the difference @xmath162 between energy @xmath163 calculated by the category @xmath164 method and the reference accurate energy @xmath165 of 36 randomly chosen states , plotted as a function of the number @xmath161 of sampled points per spatial dimension for the 1st brillouin zone integration ( see text for the explanation ) .",
    "each connected sequence of circles in a single color corresponds to a different order parameter ( with varied ordering wavevectors and unit - cell sizes ) , but the energy of every chosen state was calculated with all category methods that can handle such a state .",
    "the category-1 energy at @xmath166 is used as a reference @xmath165 .",
    "the plot is meant to illustrate the pace and manner in which the calculated energies converge to the accurate values.,width=307 ]    the ground state search employs the simplex method to minimize the state energy as a function of state parameters .",
    "each category represents the superfluid state by its own limited set of @xmath63 variable parameters , as discussed earlier .",
    "the simplex method keeps track of the function values at @xmath167 points ( vertices of the simplex ) in the abstract @xmath63-dimensional variable space .",
    "one vertex of the simplex is moved to a new position in each iteration of the method , according to a set of rules that gradually make the simplex drift toward and shrink around a local minimum in the parameter space .",
    "a search for the local minimum begins by specifying an initial `` seed '' state ( the center of the simplex ) and the overall size of the simplex ( the distance between vertices ) .",
    "the search ends after a number of iterations when the simplex shrinks below a requested minimum size .",
    "the typical accuracy of the obtained order parameters is @xmath168 of the absolute order parameter magnitude . in order to speed up the phase diagram mapping ,",
    "all discovered ground states are recorded for future use as `` seeds '' on the nearby points of the phase diagram .",
    "a few independent phase diagram scans , and many independent calculations on arbitrarily selected points , were conducted with random `` seeds '' in an attempt to reduce the danger of falling into metastable states .",
    "the search for the minimum - energy states was carried out with a reasonable level of accuracy that did not cost an extreme computation time .",
    "this was @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 sampled 1bz points per dimension for the categories 1 , 2 , 3 respectively .",
    "the category 1 is found to be very accurate even at @xmath172 , while the categories 2 and 3 reach a similar accuracy only at @xmath173 ( see fig.[errors ] ) .",
    "for the great majority of these order parameters , the three category calculations of energy agree to a fraction of a percent of the absolute energy value with @xmath166 , making absolute errors of about @xmath174 .",
    "energy minimization at high accuracy is prohibitively slow ( except in category-3 ) , so the optimal order parameters were obtained by using a manageable accuracy @xmath175 .",
    "however , the energies of discovered order parameters were recalculated at the end with high accuracy @xmath166 .",
    "all presented conclusions about the phase diagram follow from the comparisons of such accurate order - parameter energies in different categories .",
    "it is very unlikely that a highly accurate minimization would shift the order parameters enough to qualitatively change the phase diagram .",
    "the typical energy scale of the paired ground states is shown in fig.[fe - abs ] .",
    "this plot compares the best condensates found in all three categories , but their energies can not be distinguished on the absolute energy scale .",
    "this illustrates a significant frustration of the model and a fierce competition between different orders .",
    "the absolute energy difference between competing orders is often just @xmath176 , but this is sufficiently larger than the absolute error to reliably determine the ground state .    a typical energy scale @xmath165 of the lowest energy condensates in all three categories on a path through the phase diagram .",
    "the units for @xmath165 are given by the hopping @xmath51 .",
    "the best states in the category 1,2,3 are plotted by the green , blue and red lines respectively , but these lines can hardly be distinguished because they coincide when plotted on the overall energy scales.,width=288 ]    the category-2 search is particularly complicated and tedious because one variable property of the order parameter is its commensurate ordering wavevector @xmath58 .",
    "the discrete components of @xmath58 must be varied outside of the simplex energy minimization .",
    "we systematically scan for the metastable states at different @xmath58 in the order that generally favors smaller unit - cells .",
    "the category-2 algorithm searches several times for an energy minimum at every checked @xmath58 .",
    "these searches are at first done with a few restricted forms of the category-2 order parameter that were observed to often minimize energy .",
    "then the best found state is used as a `` seed '' for the final least - restricted category-2 search .",
    "each search starts with the same finite simplex size , to look for the minimum within a significant neighborhood of the `` seed '' .",
    "only the best overall result is ultimately reported for each @xmath58 as a metastable state energy .",
    "new wavevectors @xmath58 are checked down the line until the lowest discovered metastable energy has not changed in a while .",
    "this often reaches the unit - cells with up to @xmath177 or @xmath178 sites .",
    "the category-1 search also tests several candidate states at each point in the phase diagram .",
    "it first obtains the lowest possible energy of all pdw / pws states that can fit in the specified unit - cell of @xmath179 sites ( this step was skipped in the calculations on the @xmath114 unit - cell ) .",
    "then it constructs restricted order parameters that loosely correspond to type-1 and type-2 states discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and minimizes their energy .",
    "each new attempt uses the previous best result as a `` seed '' .",
    "the final minimization is restricted only by the specified unit - cell dimensions , and only the best overall state is ultimately reported .",
    "given this aggressive procedure , one can be reasonably confident that the ordered states with small unit - cells have been captured correctly .",
    "for example , we can be reasonably confident that a pdw or pws with a @xmath151 unit - cell is not the global energy minimum in the regions of the phase diagram where the tr - invariant @xmath151 vortex lattice was reported as a consistent winner",
    ". we can be still fairly confident that no pdw / pws state with a slightly larger unit - cell is the global minimum in these regions .",
    "searching as long as it takes for the most optimal ordering wavevector @xmath58 of a pdw is futile , so we can never rule out the existence of global pdw minimums with larger unit - cells .",
    "however , considering also the local quantum or thermal fluctuations , the ordered states with larger unit - cells are almost invariably destabilized more than the states with smaller unit - cells .",
    "fluctuations are certain to be prominent in our very frustrated system .",
    "the category-1 periodic order parameter is specified by complex triplet amplitudes @xmath53 at every site of a fixed unit - cell .",
    "the fermion fields @xmath2 are organized into four - component spinors , but representing their triplet pairing requires an eight - component nambu spinor at each site @xmath4 : @xmath180 expressing all terms of ( [ h0 ] ) and ( [ hint ] ) that contain fermion fields as a product of the nambu spinors @xmath181 and @xmath182 yields the bdg hamiltonian : @xmath183 where the matrices @xmath184 are defined only locally ( @xmath185 ) : @xmath186 and for the pairs of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath187 , @xmath188 : @xmath189 @xmath190 with @xmath191 , @xmath192 . including interactions in the uniform singlet pairing channels of equation [ hint2 ] amounts to adding @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "next , we carry out the fourier transform of ( [ hbdg1 ] ) by introducing a crystal momentum @xmath195 that lives in the reduced 1st brillouin zone @xmath196 , @xmath197 corresponding to the order parameter s unit - cell",
    ". we must formally join @xmath198 nambu spinors ( [ nambu1 ] ) into a single super - spinor , whose fourier transform @xmath199 corresponds to a bloch state .",
    "the fourier - transformed hamiltonian is : @xmath200 @xmath201 is constructed as a block - matrix with blocks @xmath194 ( diagonal ) and @xmath184 ( off - diagonal ) for every two sites @xmath202 in the same unit - cell .",
    "@xmath203 , @xmath204 are the @xmath195-dependent block - matrices made from @xmath184 that connect the sites belonging to different unit - cells .    the full spectrum of the bdg hamiltonian can now be obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath205 matrix for any @xmath195 in ( [ hbdg2 ] ) .",
    "since the nambu representation had to be doubled for triplet pairing , the spectrum has an unphysical double degeneracy for every state .",
    "only one of the two formally degenerate eigenstates is physical .",
    "a category-2 order parameter is generally a pair - density wave given by : @xmath206 where @xmath207 are three - component complex spinors and @xmath58 is a commensurate wavevector in the 1st brillouin zone ( 1bz ) of the crystal lattice . in order to construct a bdg representation of the hamiltonian",
    ", we must first identify the smallest positive integer @xmath208 for which @xmath209 is a reciprocal lattice vector ; @xmath208 specifies the size of a unit - cell in lattice sites for this periodic order parameter .",
    "triplet pairing will mix fermion states at momenta separated by @xmath210 . in order to capture this",
    ", we define the nambu spinor block in momentum space : @xmath211 and divide the 1bz zone into @xmath208 equal segments so that @xmath212 with @xmath213",
    ". the residual wavevector @xmath195 should live inside a reduced brillouin zone whose area is @xmath208 times smaller than that of 1bz .",
    "however , the shape of the reduced zone is restricted by @xmath58 in somewhat complicated ways .",
    "it is more practical to allow @xmath195 to vary inside the full 1bz and then divide any 1bz integrals ( e.g. in the calculation of the ground state energy ) by @xmath208 to undo the overcounting of the bdg hamiltonian eigenvalues .            with @xmath218 we used the properties @xmath219 and",
    "@xmath220 to construct the hamiltonian . once",
    "( [ hbdg3 ] ) is diagonalized also with respect to the index @xmath63 , one obtains the full set of bloch states for the pdw order parameter .",
    "the category-3 order parameter is a plane wave : @xmath221 which is a subset of the category-2 order parameters ( [ cat2op ] ) with @xmath222 for commensurate @xmath58 .",
    "however , since the triplet now lives at a single wavevector , we can diagonalize the bdg hamiltonian even when @xmath58 is incommensurate . to that end",

    "the bdg hamiltonian is readily constructed in the same manner as for a uniform order parameter , but with a doubled representation that can accommodate triplet pairing .",
    "if we introduce the following symbols based on ( [ ev ] ) : @xmath224 then the bdg hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath225 where : @xmath226 note that there is no room for uniform singlet pairing in this representation , unless @xmath153 .",
