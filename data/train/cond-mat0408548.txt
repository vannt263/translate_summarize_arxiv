    "steps on vicinal surfaces exhibit many different instabilities in the presence of non equilibrium driving forces . of particular interest to us here are the current - induced instabilities on si surfaces that were first discovered by latyshev _",
    "@xcite in 1989 .",
    "after resistive heating of a vicinal si(111 ) surface with a step - down direct current at temperature around @xmath0 , they observed the formation of closely packed step bunches separated by wide step - free terraces .",
    "the the uniform step train remained stable on heating with a step - up current .",
    "this instability has a mysterious temperature dependence , @xcite with three temperature ranges between @xmath1 and @xmath2 where the unstable current direction reverses .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments @xcite in temperature range ii ( about @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) have shown that after heating for several hours with a step - down current , the initially uniform steps exhibit a novel _ wandering instability _ with finite wavelength in - phase sinusoidal undulations in their positions . when the current is directed at an angle to the average step direction ,",
    "the undulations are continuously distorted by the field until finally all the peaks point in the direction of the field .",
    "@xcite    these instabilities likely arise from a complex interplay between the driven diffusion of adatoms induced by the electric field @xmath5 and their attachment / detachment kinetics at steps , which serve as sources and sinks of adatoms .",
    "( island formation is not important in the temperature regimes we consider . )",
    "adatoms are believed to acquire a small effective charge @xmath6 which includes both electrostatic and `` wind - force '' contributions arising from scattering of charge carriers , and thus experience a force @xmath7 that biases their diffusive motion .",
    "@xcite typically @xmath5 has a magnitude of about @xmath8 and @xmath9 is of the order of @xmath10 for si .",
    "@xcite    most theoretical methods are based on a generalization of the approach taken by burton , cabrera and frank ( bcf ) , @xcite where one considers field driven diffusion of adatoms on terraces , with boundary conditions at the steps , viewed as line sources and sinks .",
    "we will generally refer to these generalized bcf models as _ sharp step models_. surface reconstruction typically seen on semiconductor surfaces clearly has important effects on the movement of adatoms on terraces and may well affect the attachment kinetics at steps .",
    "while it is relatively simple to take account of reconstruction on terrace diffusion by changing the diffusion constant , it is much less clear how it should be incorporated into the boundary conditions at the step edges .",
    "many different boundary conditions have been proposed , incorporating , e.g. , asymmetric attachment - detachment barriers,@xcite periphery diffusion along a step,@xcite permeable steps,@xcite and field - dependent kinetic coefficient,@xcite and researchers have shown that different combinations can give results that can agree with some experiments on current - induced step bunching . however , a general understanding of the physics leading to the sharp step boundary conditions and how they are affected by reconstruction and the external field is far from clear .",
    "we discuss here a simple model incorporating the key physical features of driven diffusion and surface reconstruction . it can provide a consistent explanation of many experimental results on both si(111 ) and si(001 ) surfaces in terms of a few effective parameters .",
    "the model also provides a physically suggestive way of interpreting sharp step boundary conditions , showing how the effective parameters in continuum models can be related to kinetic processes on vicinal surfaces .",
    "@xcite    in the following , we will set up the basic two - region diffusion model and then examine the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) solutions .",
    "step bunching and wandering regimes are discussed , and combined to provide a coherent scenario for the complicated si(111 ) electromigration experiments .",
    "a mapping to the generalized bcf model is presented next that sheds light on the sharp step boundary conditions . finally , we study the long time and nonlinear behavior of these instabilities and find some intriguing patterns that resemble many features seen in real experiments on si(111 ) surfaces",
    ". an alternate derivation of the basic equations and applications to the different instabilities seen in si(001 ) surfaces is given elsewhere .",
    "@xcite     always follows the motion of the step ( solid line ) .",

    "it is well known that the dangling bonds at semiconductor surfaces quite generally rearrange to form characteristic surface reconstructions .",
    "we expect a different local rearrangement of bonds in the vicinity of a step , which itself represents an additional source of dangling bonds .",
    "clearly this reconstruction can directly influence surface mass transport and hence possible instabilities .",
    "standard boundary conditions in the continuum sharp step model may include some effects of surface reconstruction in special cases .",
    "for example , liu and weeks @xcite interpreted electromigration experiments in the lowest temperature regime of si(111 ) using attachment / detachment limited kinetics , and argued that the attachment barriers could arise from a local reconstruction of the dangling bonds at a step edge .",
    "however , it is not clear how this picture should be modified at higher temperatures .",
    "steps differ fundamentally from terraces by serving as sources and sinks for adatoms . in the classical bcf picture",
    "it was assumed that the local equilibrium concentration of adatoms at a step is maintained even in the presence of nonequilibrium driving forces .",
    "in addition the rates of various mass transport processes near steps can differ from kinetic processes on terraces , e.g. , because of differences in local surface reconstructions .",
    "the kinetic coefficients in generalized bcf models try to take both features of steps into account in an effective way .",
    "our approach here is to consider a more detailed description where both features are treated separately in the simplest possible way .",
    "we then obtain the relevant sharp step boundary condition by an appropriate coarse - graining . to that end , we assume that an atomic step has sufficient kink sites to maintain a local equilibrium concentration of adatoms as in the classical bcf picture .",
    "reconstruction is taken into account by assuming that the atomic step is surrounded by a _ step region _ where adatoms undergo effective diffusion with a diffusion constant @xmath11 that can differ from @xmath12 , the value found on terraces .",
    "here we use the simplest realization of this idea , where the reconstruction is assumed to occur fast relative to step motion , so that the step region moves with the atomic step and has a fixed width @xmath13 of a few lattice spacings at a given temperature .",
    "thus a uniform vicinal surface can be viewed as an array of repetitive two - region units , made up of the @xmath14th step region and its neighboring lower terrace region .",
    "we assume that straight steps extend along the @xmath15 direction and that the step index increases in the step - down direction , defined as the positive @xmath16 direction , asde schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tworegion_schm ] .",
    "the adatoms undergo driven diffusion from the electric field .",
    "the biased diffusion flux of adatoms with density @xmath17 takes the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 indicates the terrace or step region and @xmath20 is the diffusion constant in the corresponding region , which here is taken to be isotropic for simplicity .",
    "we also assume that the effective charge is the same in both regions and ignore the small effects of step motion on the steady state adatom density field , since the direct field - induced adatom drift velocity is generally very much larger than the net velocity of the steps ( driven by free sublimation in real experiments ) even at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite    in many studies of step dynamics , because the separation of their respective time scales , it suffices to solve the diffusion problem with fixed step positions and then balance the fluxes locally at a step to determine its motion .",
    "this is often called the _ quasi - stationary _ approximation , and it will be adopted throughout this paper . thus the static diffusion problem is simply @xmath21 in each region , along with continuity of @xmath17 and @xmath22 at fixed boundaries between terrace and step regions .",

    "this allows the step wandering that generally occurs with a step - down force to be separated from step bunching .",
    "the transition between different temperature regimes is governed by the relative diffusitivity in the terrace and step regions .",

    "the long time evolution of the step instabilities was calculated by numerical integration of a set of equations based on the standard velocity function formalism with the addition of a periphery diffusion term .",
    "the linear instabilities are recovered at short times and interesting 2d pattern formation is see at longer times in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "we also showed that a geometric representation of the step provides a simple way to describe the nonlinear evolution of step wandering patterns with large curvatures .",
