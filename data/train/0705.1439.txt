    "massive stars explode via core collapse and ejection of their surrounding layers ( e.g. , arnett et al .",
    "1989 , and references therein ) .",
    "the extent to which core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are , or have been , a major source of dust in the universe is of great interest . for many years",
    "it has been hypothesized that the physical conditions in the expanding ejecta of ccsne could result in the condensation of large masses of dust grains @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that large abundances of suitable refractory elements are present .",
    "in addition , cooling by adiabatic expansion and molecular emission takes place , and dynamical instabilities can produce density enhancements or `` clumping . ''",
    "this , in turn , will aid dust formation through the effects of cooling and self - shielding .",
    "further support for these ideas is provided by isotopic anomalies in meteorites which indicate that some grains must have formed in ccsne @xcite .",
    "+ interest in ccsne as dust producers has increased recently due to the problem of accounting for the presence of dust at high redshifts @xcite . in these early eras ,",
    "much less dust production from novae and asymptotic giant branch stars is expected since fewer stars will have evolved past the main - sequence phase . consequently , ccsne arising from population  iii stars have been proposed as the main early - universe source of dust @xcite . models of dust formation in ccsne @xcite succeed in producing copious amounts of dust  around 0.11  m@xmath1 even in the low - metallicity environments at high redshifts .",
    "this corresponds to a supernova ( sn ) dust condensation efficiency of about 0.2 @xcite , where the efficiency is defined as the dust mass divided by the total mass of refractory elements .",
    "this is enough to account for the quantity of dust seen at high redshifts ( see appendix ) .",
    "+ newly condensed dust in ccsne can be detected by its attenuating effects on optical / near - infrared ( ir ) light or via thermal emission from the grains in the ejecta .",
    "these methods have been used in attempts to measure the dust productivity of ccsne .",
    "both methods are subject to uncertainties due to dust formation in optically thick clumps , so the derived masses tend to be just lower limits . by far the most extensive evidence for ejecta dust condensation is that obtained from the peculiar type  ii sn  1987a , where both techniques were employed @xcite .",
    "however , even the highest value obtained is only @xmath3  m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the attenuation method to infer a dust mass exceeding @xmath4  m@xmath1 in the type  iin sn  1998s .",
    "however , such events are relatively rare . moreover , in this case it is suggested that the dust condensation was not in the body of the ejecta , but rather took place in the cool , dense shell produced by the impact of the sn ejecta with circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "we note also that an alternative ir - echo scenario for sn  1998s is not ruled out @xcite .",
    "+ prior to the launch of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( hereafter , _ spitzer _ ) , the only evidence of dust condensation in a typical ccsn was presented by @xcite , who used optical line attenuation to infer a dust mass lower limit of about @xmath5  m@xmath1 in the type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) sn  1999em .",
    "mid - ir studies of the cassiopeia  a supernova remnant ( snr ) @xcite indicate that dust formation took place during its explosion , but again the mass of directly observed dust is small .",
    "sub - millimeter studies of this snr by @xcite using scuba led them to claim that at least 2  m@xmath6 of dust formed in the supernova .",
    "however , @xcite have used the same data together with observations from _",
    "spitzer _ to show that most of this emission originates from a line - of - sight molecular cloud , and not from dust formed in cas  a. @xcite used _ spitzer",
    "_ observations to estimate @xmath7  m@xmath6 of dust in the crab nebula snr .",
    "while rather uncertain , this result may be more relevant to this paper than that of cas  a , since the crab nebula is thought to have arisen from a progenitor of mass 810  m@xmath6 @xcite , similar to that of the ccsn studied here ( sn  2003gd ) .",
    "+ in summary , prior to the launch of _ spitzer _ , direct observations of ccsne or snrs have never revealed more than @xmath810@xmath9  m@xmath1 of dust  only @xmath81% of the mass required if ccsne are to be important dust sources .",
    "but the number of ccsne investigated for dust production is small , and with the exception of sn  1999em , rather atypical .",
    "the availability of _ spitzer _ has provided an excellent opportunity for us to test the ubiquity of dust condensation in a statistically significant number of typical ccsne .",
    "it provides high - sensitivity imaging over the mid - ir , covering the likely peak of the dust thermal emission spectrum .",
    "this can provide a superior measure of the total flux , temperature and , possibly , dust emissivity than can be achieved at shorter wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the longer - wavelength coverage of _ spitzer _ lets us detect cooler grains and see more deeply into dust clumps than was previously possible for typical nearby ccsne .",
    "in addition , multi - epoch observations with _ spitzer _ can distinguish between dust condensation and ir  echoes via the strength and shape of the light curve .",
    "+ in this paper we analyze _ spitzer _ observations of the type  ii - p sn  2003gd at three late - time epochs . @xcite and @xcite ( henceforth `` s06 '' ) reported optical attenuation effects in the late - time spectra and @xmath10 light curves of sn  2003gd which indicate dust condensation in this event . using _ spitzer _",
    "observations at two late - time epochs , s06 also report mid - ir emission from the condensing dust .",
    "this was the first - ever report of condensing dust in a sn  ii - p on the basis of thermal emission from the grains . here",
    "we present a new study of these _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "we agree with s06 that some of the earlier - epoch mid - ir emission was due to a modest quantity of ejecta dust .",
    "however , we find that their principal conclusion , that the later - epoch observations indicate the presence of 0.02  m@xmath6 of dust formed in the ejecta , is not supported by the data . consequently , thus far there is no direct evidence that ccsne are major dust factories .",

    "we therefore also consider the implications of this observation .",
    "a point source at the sn position is clearly visible in the day  496/9 image in all four _ irac _ channels , with strong fading by day  670 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig1](a , b ) , where we show the 8  @xmath2 m _ irac _ images from day  496/9 and day  670 . given the large decline in flux",
    ", we deduce that most of the point - source flux detected on day  496/9 was due to the sn .",
    "however , measurement of the sn flux is challenging owing to the bright , complex field within which it lies .",
    "we used the _ snoopy _ point - spread function ( psf ) fitting package to determine the sn fluxes and coordinates .",
    "_ snoopy _ was originally designed by f. patat to carry out sn photometry .",
    "it was implemented in iraf by e. cappellaro and is based on daophot , and has been tested and improved over a number of years .",
    "several suitable psf stars are selected in order to build the model psf and measure the full - width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) .",
    "first a polynomial surface , of orders between 3 and 6 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , is fitted to the background in a @xmath21 region centered on the sn position , excluding the innermost square region around the sn , of side @xmath22 .",
    "this is then subtracted from the image .",
    "next the psf fitting is performed on the sn .",
    "the fitted psf is subsequently subtracted from the data to produce a residual image .",
    "this is inspected by eye , and the fitting procedure repeated until a residual image is obtained where there is little sign of the original point source .",
    "the code returns the @xmath19 and @xmath20 position and the flux within the psf .",
    "it also provides a statistical uncertainty which is a measure of how well the model psf describes the flux value and distribution at the sn position .",
    "however , the flux values are quite sensitive to the fitting of the image background with the polynomial surface",
    ". this may introduce an additional uncertainty in the absolute flux values , although the effect on the shape of the spectral energy distribution is likely to be less than this .",
    "+ the results and estimated uncertainties are shown in table [ tab1 ] . as a check of the psf - fitting procedure , field stars",
    "were also measured using both this method and aperture photometry .",
    "the aperture radius was @xmath23 with a 1520@xmath24 concentric sky annulus .",
    "no significant systematic flux difference was found between the two methods at any wavelength .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter in the differences was 0.050.18  mag .",
    "the rms scatter at each wavelength was adopted as the uncertainty . as a further check",
    ", we performed aperture photometry for three stars in both post - basic calibrated data ( pbcd ) and sings - processed _ irac _ 8  @xmath2 m frames , and found that the photometry agrees to within 5% .",
    "this test was also applied to the day  678/81 _ mips _ 24  @xmath2 m frames ( see below ) and similar consistency was obtained .",
    "we also determined the _ difference _ in the fluxes between day  496/9 and day  670 via image subtraction .",
    "while this only gives the change in flux between the two epochs , it is a particularly powerful method of removing the effects of a spatially varying background such as is encountered in sn images from _ spitzer _ @xcite . also , given the very weak flux at the sn location on day  670 , this procedure provides a robust check on the net supernova emission . + for each channel , the day  670 image ( pbcd processed ) was subtracted from the earlier enhanced data product sings image through the use of image matching and subtraction techniques as implemented in the isis  2.2 image - subtraction package @xcite .",
    "the 8.0  @xmath2 m subtracted image is shown in fig . [ fig1](c ) .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrate the applicability of the image - subtraction technique for _ spitzer / irac _ sn data and investigate its uncertainties .",
    "aperture photometry of the subtracted images was then carried out using the starlink package gaia @xcite .",
    "a circular aperture of radius @xmath25 was used for the photometry .",
    "this aperture was chosen as a compromise between maximizing the sampled fraction of source flux ( the radius of the first diffraction minimum at the extreme red end of the 8.0  @xmath2 m channel is @xmath26 ) and minimizing any extended residual emission in the subtracted image .",
    "aperture corrections were derived from the _ irac _ psf images available on the _ spitzer _ website .",
    "the correction factors were 1.23 , 1.26 , 1.50 , and 1.65 for 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "+ for each measurement , the aperture was centered on the sn image using a combination of centroid estimates and visual inspection .",

    "the results are shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the uncertainty was determined from the sky variance within the sky annulus .",
    "these error estimates were confirmed by measuring the variance in the ( day  496    day  499 ) subtracted frame for each band , assuming a similar underlying error in the unsubtracted day  670 frame , and appropriately combining the two errors .",
    "these uncertainties are quoted in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "the difference is over @xmath28 .",
    "as discussed below , we attribute this significant difference to the presence of a residual source in the day  670 image . in table",

    "there is reasonable consistency with our psf results , although at 8.0  @xmath2 m we see a higher flux at a significance of just under @xmath27 .",
    "given the complexity of the field this difference is , perhaps , not too surprising .",
    "on day  670 , there was no detectable source at or near the sn position at 3.6  @xmath2 m , 4.5  @xmath2 m , or 5.8  @xmath2 m .",

    "we compared the positions of these sources with that of the sn .",

    "we also measured the sn coordinates in the same image using three other methods : centroiding , optimal filtering , and gaussian fitting as implemented in the iraf center task .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the results from these four methods were adopted as the sn position and uncertainty , respectively .",
    "+ to convert the sn coordinates to the day  670 _ irac _ and day  678/81 _ mips _ images , we derived geometric transformations between these images and the day  496/9 8  @xmath2",

    "the transformation between the day  496/9 and day  670 8  @xmath2 m images was obtained using the centroid coordinates of 20 isolated sources visible in both frames .",
    "we used iraf geomap to derive a general transformation including shifts , scales , and rotations in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and a second - order polynomial for the nonlinear part .",
    "the transformation between the day  496/9 8  @xmath2 m sings image and the 24  @xmath2 m _ mips _ image was obtained in a similar manner , using the centroid coordinates of 20 isolated sources visible in both frames .",
    "+ to measure the coordinates of the 8  @xmath2 m and 24  @xmath2 m sources detected near the sn position , we again used psf fitting ( _ snoopy _ ) .",
    "the associated uncertainties were estimated by simulating point sources using a gaussian psf with a flux similar to the faint source .",
    "artificial sources were placed in each of the images at nine positions where the background was judged to have a similar level and complexity to that of the sn location .",
    "the coordinates of these sources were measured with psf fitting using the same polynomial orders for modelling the background as for the actual 8  @xmath2 m and 24  @xmath2 m sources .",
    "finally , the measured coordinates were compared with the known positions of the simulated sources and the standard deviations of their offsets were adopted as the uncertainties in our coordinate measurements .",
    "+ our conclusion from the above astrometric measurements is that the 8  @xmath2 m source coincides with the sn position to within @xmath29 ( 90% confidence ) , and the 24  @xmath2 m source coincides with the sn position to within @xmath30 ( 90% confidence ) i.e. in both cases the coincidence is to within 1 native pixel ( @xmath31 at 8  @xmath2 m , @xmath32 at 24  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "the bulk of the position coincidence uncertainty arose from the psf fitting to the days  670 - 81 sources with a smaller contribution from the co - ordinate transformation and a negligible contribution from measuring the position of the sn on day  496/9 .",
    "+ we measured the fluxes of the days  67081 sources using our psf - fitting procedure , obtaining @xmath33jy at 8.0  @xmath2 m and @xmath34jy at 24.0  @xmath2 m .",
    "the 8.0  @xmath2 m flux is consistent with the @xmath35jy difference in the flux between the day  496/9 image and the subtracted image ( see table 1 ) , indicating that the difference was due to the residual source in the day  670 image .",
    "the sensitivity on day  670 and day  678/81 is dominated by the effects of the bright nearby sources on the psf fitting . for the other three _",
    "irac _ channels , upper limits were obtained based on direct psf measurements of the day  670 images and on the difference between the day  496/9 images and subtracted images .",

    "it is not possible to conclusively eliminate a significant ir  echo contribution to the mid - ir emission at day  496/9 .",

    "+ we first hypothesize that the days  670 - 81 8  @xmath2 m and ( unsubtracted ) 24  @xmath2 m sources have the same origin and that this origin is the sn ejecta . a simple blackbody match to our days  670 - 81 flux measurements yields a temperature of 250  k , a radius of @xmath87  cm , and a luminosity of @xmath88  erg  s@xmath51 .",
    "this is immediately problematic . to attain a radius of @xmath87  cm the material at the outer limit of the blackbody would have to be travelling at 3200  km  s@xmath51",

    "thus , on both energy and velocity considerations , we have evidence that most of the 8  @xmath2 m and 24  @xmath2 m fluxes can not be due to emission from supernova ejecta dust .",
    "+ let us now suppose that only the fading component of the 24  @xmath2 m source is due to ejecta dust while the remainder of the 24  @xmath2 m flux plus some or all of the 8  @xmath2 m flux is due to a background source . at 250  k , to match the fading component would require a blackbody luminosity of 3 times the likely deposited radioactive luminosity and a velocity of @xmath92  km  s@xmath51 , where the error is due to the flux uncertainty .",
    "even if we reduce the distance by 1  mpc and use the lower limit of the flux values , the velocity still exceeds 2000  km  s@xmath51 and the luminosity still exceeds the deposited radioactive luminosity by a factor of 2 . reducing the temperature from 250  k to 150  k , the luminosity falls by 30% but the velocity of the blackbody surface rises to an increasingly implausible @xmath93 km  s@xmath51 .",

    "models of dust formation in ccsne @xcite succeed in producing copious amounts of dust  around 0.11  m@xmath1 even in the low - metallicity environments of the early universe .",
    "this corresponds to a sn dust condensation efficiency of about 0.2 @xcite , where the efficiency is defined as the dust mass divided by the total mass of refractory elements .",
    "this is enough to account for the quantity of dust seen at high redshifts .",
    "+ as a demonstration , let us consider the results of @xcite . in their study of high - redshift quasars they deduced , from the far - ir luminosities , a star - formation rate of @xmath83000  m@xmath1 yr@xmath51 and a dust - formation rate of @xmath81  m@xmath1 yr@xmath51 .",
    "consider a simple stellar mass spectrum + @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath110 to @xmath111 , @xmath112 is a constant with units of ( mass)@xmath113 , and all stars lie within the mass range 0.2  m@xmath114 30  m@xmath1 . the total stellar mass in the interval @xmath110 to @xmath115 is given by @xmath116",

    "sn would have to be 0.036  m@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the production rates of dust condensation models @xcite are indeed sufficient to account for the high - redshift dust .",

    "this would produce about 0.3  m@xmath1 of refractory elements @xcite .",
    "consequently , for such a sn to match the required average dust production , the refractory elements would have to be converted into dust with an efficiency of about 0.1 .",
