    "low - dimensional magnets have unique electronic and magnetic properties . for example , the physical properties of quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) high - temperature superconductor@xcite , spin - peierls compound@xcite , haldane chain@xcite and spin - ladder@xcite as well as spin - frustrated systems@xcite have been extensively investigated . in most of the low - dimensional magnets ,",
    "the magnetic cation sublattices consist of planes or chains which are kept reasonably far apart .",
    "materials which exhibit three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic ion sublattice and low - dimensional magnetic behavior have been of interest to both experimentalist and theorists.@xcite up to date , the electronic orbital ordering ( oo ) is considered as an essential factor in determining the strong spacial exchange anisotropy in these materials .",
    "kagf@xmath0 is a material which exhibit strong spacial exchange anisotropy within 3d magnetic ag@xmath3 ion sublattice.@xcite it was first synthesized in 1971 by odenthal _",
    "et al_.@xcite and received , as well as other silver fluorides , attention due to the pursuit of superconductivity@xcite in transition - metal compounds other than the cuprates .",
    "previous experimental studies@xcite have provided the evidence of its antiferromagnetism with t@xmath5=64 k as well as the insulating characteristic below this temperature .",
    "in contrast to the undoped cuprates that are quasi-2d antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator , kagf@xmath0 was reported as a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnet using lsda+__u _",
    "_ method.@xcite however , more efforts are still needed to well understand the origin of the quasi-1d antiferromagnetism .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the electronic structure and the magnetic properties of kagf@xmath0 using density functional theory ( dft ) . the calculated",

    "the quasi-1d antiferromagnetism can be understood by the _ c_-antiferro - distortive oo which can be obtained in the presence of on - site coulomb repulsion _",
    "u_. the picture of oo and afm insulating state is thus very similar to that of an isoelectronic and isostructural compound , kcuf@xmath0 .",
    "our electronic structure calculations are performed within the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave framework.@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof form is adopted.@xcite to include the on site coulomb interaction gga+__u _ _ ( _ _ u__=on - site coulomb repulsion strength ) approach is used with _ _ u@xmath7__=_u_-_j _ ( _ j _ is the exchange interaction ) instead of _",

    "the muffin - tin sphere radii are chosen to be 2.24 , 2.09 , and 1.85 bohr for k , ag , and f atoms , respectively . within the muffin - tin sphere",
    "the electrons behave as they were in the free atom , and the wave functions are expanded using radial functions ( solutions to the radial part of schringer equation ) times spherical harmonics . out of the muffin - tin spheres wave functions are expanded using plane waves .",
    "the value of r@xmath8k@xmath9 ( the smallest muffin - tin radius multiplied by the maximum _ k _ value in the expansion of plane waves in the basis set ) is set to 7.0 .",
    "we use 500 _ k _ points ( i.e. , 192 _ k _ points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ) for the integration over the brillouin zone . self - consistency was considered to be achieved when the total energy difference between succeeding iterations is less than 10@xmath10 ry / unit cell .",
    "the present setup ensures a sufficient accuracy of the calculations .    in our study",
    ", we carry out total energy calculations with three distinct spin states of ( 1 ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) , ( 2 ) _",

    "the calculations were performed for orthorhombic structure proposed by mazej _ et al_.@xcite , space group _ pnma _ ( no.62 ) , with the lattice constants _ _ a__=6.2689  , _ _",

    "c__=6.1844  ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in our calculations we use for each agf@xmath11 octahedron such corresponding local _",
    "xyz _ coordinates that the _ z _ axis is along the b axis and the _ x _ and _ y _ axes are approximately along the inplane nearest neighbor ag - ag directions . in kagf@xmath0 , the ag ion sublattice forms a pseudocubic structure , in which ag - ag distance along _ z _ direction is slightly shorter than that in the _ xy _ plane .",
    "there are two types of f sites .",
    "one connects the ag ions along the _",
    "z_-axis ( named as f@xmath12 ) and the other connects the ag ions in the _ xy _ plane ( named as f@xmath13 ) .",
    "the agf@xmath14 planes are slightly puckered since the f@xmath13 ions have a 0.31  displacement from the plane formed by ag ions . each ag and its six near f ions",
    "form a jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted agf@xmath11 octahedron .",
    "the distortion leads to the alternating long and short ag - f bonds along the _ x _ and _ y _ axes .",
    "the four shorter ag - f bonds are almost identical .",
    "the cooperative jt distortion provides a signature of an orbital ordering ( oo ) at the ag@xmath3 sites , which determines the electronic structure as well as the magnetic properties .    in order to clarify the electronic structure and the origin of the quasi-1d magnetism in kagf@xmath15 ,",
    "our calculations are designed in two stages .",
    "we start the study within gga . to account for a possible lattice distortion",
    ", we carried out an optimization of the atomic positions , keeping the unit - cell parameters fixed and relaxing the atomic coordinates .",
    "the structural optimization shows that the ag - f@xmath12 bond is elongated by 0.012  and the in - plane longer ( shorter ) ag - f@xmath13 bond is shortened ( elongated ) by 0.085  ( 0.038  ) as compared with the experimentally observed structure . as a result ,",
    "the large in - plane distortion of about 0.3  found experimentally , decreases to 0.2  theoretically .",
    "moreover , the gga results for the optimized structure show that the fm , _",
    "a_-afm and _ g_-afm spin states are not stable and converge to nonmagnetic ( nm ) metallic solution .",
    "2 shows the total and the orbital - resolved density of states ( dos ) for the nm kagf@xmath15 .",
    "the distortive agf@xmath11 octahedron crystal field splits the ag@xmath3 4__d__@xmath4 orbitals into fully occupied _ _",
    "t__@xmath16 ( _ xz _ , _ xy _ , _ yz _ ) and three fourth occupied _ _",
    "e__@xmath17 ( _ _ z__@xmath18-__y__@xmath18 , 3__x__@xmath18-__r__@xmath18 ) orbitals . both the anti - bonding ag _ _ d__@xmath19 and _",
    "_ d__@xmath20 bands cross the fermi level with large band widths of about 3 ev and have strong covalency@xcite with the f orbitals .",
    "the band center of the _ _ d__@xmath21 is higher in energy than that of _ _ d__@xmath22 orbital .",
    "thus , the jt distortion generates a crystal - field splitting which is not large enough to separate the two _",
    "_ e__@xmath23 bands .",
    "even the gga calculations for the experimental structure still give a nm metallic solution for all the enforced spin states , in accordance with the previously published work.@xcite unlike the electronic structure of gga optimized structure with two type of _ _ e__@xmath17 bands crossing the fermi level , the distortion alone separates the _ _ e__@xmath17 bands with only one of them cross the fermi level ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , the gga calculations can not reproduce the insulating afm nature of kagf@xmath15 .",
    "this is in contrast to another fuoroargentate cs@xmath24agf@xmath14 in which jt distortion alone can lead to the orbital ordered insulating state.@xcite    as the second stage , we concern the correlation interaction by gga+__u _ _ approach . in general ,",
    "strong on - site coulomb repulsion _ u _ increases the localization of _ d _ electrons and favors orbital ordering and/or magnetic order .",
    "however , the magnitude of the correlation for the ag@xmath3 ion is not known . in order to determine its value",
    ", we performed a structural optimization as a function of _ u _ ( 1 - 6 ev ) and found the _ u _ value with which the equilibrium structure matches the experimental one .",
    "this scheme to extract the coulomb parameter is feasible because the on - site coulomb repulsion _ u _ determines the orbital polarization of the _ _ e__@xmath23 states for a large extent , which , in turn , causes the structural jt lattice distortion .",
    "the optimized inequivalent ag - f distances _ _ d__@xmath25 , _ _ d__@xmath24 and _ _ d__@xmath15 are shown in fig .",
    "we find that the optimized structure for _ _ u__=5.0 ev is the closest to the one obtained experimentally .",
    "and thus this _ u _ is adopted as the most reliable one .",
    "this value is smaller than the commonly used _ _ u__=7 - 9 ev value for cu@xmath3 but still reasonable , because the 4__d _ _ orbitals of an ag@xmath3 ion are less contracted than the 3__d _ _ orbitals of a cu@xmath3 ion .",
    "the gga+__u _ _ ( 5 ev ) total energy calculations of various spin states shown in table i indicate that the ground spin state is the _",
    "a_-afm insulating state .",
    "the obtained ground spin state is in accordance with the previous lsda+u results.@xcite this indicates that the on - site coulomb repulsion is important in determining the afm insulating properties in kagf@xmath15 .",
    "we note that the difference in total energy between the _ a_-afm and _ g_-afm spin states is as small as 23 mev/4f.u . ,",
    "while the energy difference between the _ a_-afm and fm spin states is about 272 mev/4f.u .. we should notice the fact that _ a_-afm and _ g_-afm spin states have opposite ordering in the _ xy _ plane but the same ordering along the _ z _ direction , whereas both the _ a_-afm and fm spin states have the same ordering in the _ xy _ plane but different ordering along the _ z _ axis .",
    "this reveals that afm exchange interactions along the _ z _ direction are more favorable and robust than fm coupling in the _ xy _ plane , indicating a strong spacial exchange anisotropy in kagf@xmath15 .    to gain additional insight into the spacial exchange anisotropy",
    ", we evaluate the magnetic exchange constants along and perpendicular to the _ z _ axis numerically in terms of the heisenberg spin hamiltonian : @xmath26 where the first ( second ) term refers to summing over all nearest neighbors along ( perpendicular to ) the _ z _ axis . by mapping the obtained total energies for each magnetic state to the next nearest heisenberg model , the exchange interactions _ j _ and _ j@xmath2 _ are @xmath27 @xmath28 with the spin _ _ s__=1/2 of a 4__d__@xmath4 ag@xmath3 ion , we get _ _ j__=136 mev and _ _ j__@xmath2=-5.8 mev , indicating strong afm coupling along the _ z _ axis and a much weaker fm coupling in the _ xy _ plane . _",
    "_ @xmath29/j__=0.04 reflects strong quasi-1d magnetism in kagf@xmath0 .",
    "thus , it has been concluded that kagf@xmath0 is another material exhibiting quasi-1d magnetic behavior within 3d magnetic ions sublattice , which is in accordance with the results of mazej et al .. @xcite the relatively large _",
    "j _ and _ _ j__@xmath2 values are consistent with the findings that the dft electronic structure calculations generally overestimate the magnitude of spin exchange interactions.@xcite    the quasi-1d magnetic behavior can be understood from the ground state electronic structure and oo of kagf@xmath15 .",
    "the total and the orbital - resolved dos for the _",
    "a_-afm spin state experimental structure are shown in fig .",
    "the coulomb repulsion _ u _ pushes the occupied and unoccupied 4__d _ _ levels downward and upward respectively and opens up an insulating gap .",
    "it is obvious that the one hole states mainly occupy the higher level _ _ d__@xmath19 bands and the orbital polarization of _ _ e__@xmath17 states is enhanced .",
    "actually , due to the strong ag - f covalency@xcite the one hole spreads over the six fluorine atoms of the agf@xmath11 octahedron .",
    "this is also reflected by the magnitude of local spin magnetic moments within each muffin - tin sphere , @xmath300.62 @xmath31@xmath32/ag , 0@xmath31@xmath32/f@xmath12 and @xmath300.09@xmath31@xmath32/f@xmath13 ( see table i ) .",
    "the hole states have alternating _ _ d__@xmath19 and _ _ d__@xmath21 symmetry for ag@xmath3 ions in the xy plane ( see the last panel in fig .",
    "5 ) because of the cooperative jt distortion .",
    "the in - plane _ _",
    "d__@xmath21/__d__@xmath19 oo repeats along the _ z_-axis and _ c_-antiferro - distortive",
    "oo is formed , which is clearly shown in fig .",
    "5 . the overlap of ag - f - ag along the _ z_-axis ( see the upper and middle panel in fig .",
    "5 ) is larger than that in the xy plane ( the lower panel in fig .",
    "5 ) leading to the dominate magnetic interaction along _ z_-axis .",
    "c_-antiferro - distortive oo would immediately give _",
    "a_-afm spin state , according to goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules .",
    "also , our gga+__u _ _ calculation results confirm this mechanism since it shows that the _ a_-afm state is indeed more stable than the _",
    "g_-afm and fm states ( see table i ) .",
    "therefore , the results of our calculations have clearly illustrated that kagf@xmath15 is an orbitally ordered quasi-1d afm insulator , in close analogy to kcuf@xmath15 .",
    "by gga and gga+__u _ _ electronic structure calculations , we have found the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetism of kagf@xmath15 with _ _",
    "j@xmath2/@xmath6j@xmath6__=0.04 , which may stimulate further experimental studies . here , _ j _ ( _ j@xmath2 _ ) refers to exchange constant along ( perpendicular to ) the _ z _ axis .",
    "the quasi-1d antiferromagnetism can be understood by the _ c_-antiferro - distortive orbital ordering .",
    "the orbital ordered insulating state can only be obtained when the on - site coulomb repulsion of ag 4__d _ _ electrons is in consideration . with _ _ u__=5 ev for ag 4__d _ _ electrons the optimized structure is in the best agreement with experiment .",
    "the picture of orbital ordering and afm insulating state is thus very similar to that of an isoelectronic and isostructural compound , kcuf@xmath0 .",
