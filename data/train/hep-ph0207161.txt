    "<S> we show that in the case of the bfkl pomeron with running coupling the diffusion pattern is strongly modified and is characterised by the sudden tunneling transition to the non - perturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that by using the @xmath0 - expansion method one can suppress the non - perturbative pomeron and isolate purely perturbative part of the gluon green s function .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the major issues in the high energy limit of qcd is the problem of interplay between the perturbative and non - perturbative regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the bfkl pomeron in the leading logarithmic approximation @xcite results in the equation which exhibits the characteristic diffusion pattern @xcite . in the process with two , comparable hard scales ( for example @xmath1 , or forward jet/@xmath2 in dis ) </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the transverse scales of the gluons broadens with increasing rapidity , with the width @xmath3 where @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the transverse momentum of the gluon and @xmath6 being a qcd parameter . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for sufficiently high energies the distribution of the gluon momenta will always reach non - perturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> this picture of diffusion is well rooted in the case of the fixed @xmath7 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of subleading corrections @xcite is , among other , the running of the qcd coupling . in this case </S>",
    "<S> one would expect small modification of the diffusion picture , namely that the distribution of the momenta will develop an asymmetry towards lower scales . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent of the cross section gains additional term @xmath8 apart from the usual leading @xmath9 term , where @xmath10 is the rapidity of the process . </S>",
    "<S> this picture holds however for rapidities which are not too large . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that the transition to the non - perturbative regime can occur as a sudden tunneling effect rather than a gradual diffusion process . instead of slow increase of the width of the distribution of the momenta , one observes a sudden transition from the perturbative scales @xmath11 into the non - perturbative regime @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale set by the regularisation of the running coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic feature of this effect is that it occurs without any passage through the intermediate scales evolution equation , the generation of the saturation scale @xmath14 leads to the suppression of diffusion into the low scales @xmath15 and the distribution of the momenta is driven towards the perturbative regime . ] . to gain insight into the effect of the tunneling we shall consider the small @xmath16 evolution which is controlled by the bfkl equation of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bfkl kernel and @xmath19 gluon green s function evaluated at rapidity @xmath20 and scales @xmath21 and @xmath22 with initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> kernel @xmath23 is the usual bfkl kernel in the leading logarithmic approximation , but we additionally introduce the running of the coupling @xmath24 .    the detailed mechanism of the tunneling is illustrated in fig.1 where we show the contour plots in the @xmath21 and @xmath10 plane of the function @xmath25 which illustrates the change of distribution of the transverse momenta during evolution between two points : from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . at the beginning of the evolution @xmath28 the solution exhibits typical diffusion pattern and the broadening of the distribution . around @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling transition occurs in which emerges second region concentrated around non - perturbative scale @xmath30 . at higher rapidities </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is concentrated only in the non - perturbative region . </S>",
    "<S> one can estimate the value of rapidity at which the tunneling transition takes place . </S>",
    "<S> we just have to compare the contribution to the green s function which comes from the tunneling configuration with that coming from the perturbative evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling configuration can be written as : @xmath31 where the first term corresponds to branching from @xmath21 to @xmath30 , second to the evolution at @xmath30 with a non - perturbative pomeron intercept @xmath32 and the last term corresponds to branching from @xmath30 back to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> instead the configuration which comes from the normal perturbative evolution is just @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the effective perturbative saddle point exponent .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +    tunneling transition will take place when @xmath35 and this occurs at rapidity @xmath36 which shows the linear dependence on @xmath21 and the slope governed by the value of the intercept of the non - perturbative pomeron @xmath32 .    from this analysis </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that in the case of the small @xmath16 evolution with running coupling one has always contamination from the non - perturbative contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the real problem lies then in the definition of the perturbative hard pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> a way of solving this problem is to consider the @xmath0-expansion @xcite i.e. take the limit in which @xmath37 where @xmath0 is the beta function coefficient of the qcd coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that the gluon green s function can be decomposed into the perturbative and non - perturbative terms and that the ratio of these two components is roughly of the form @xmath38}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is some function which can depend on the details of the model for small @xmath16 evolution ( for example airy , collinear , full bfkl ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see , that the non - perturbative pomeron is asymptotically leading since we always have @xmath40 but is suppressed by the universal exponential factor . by taking the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 we can eliminate the non - perturbative pomeron and are able to isolate purely perturbative contribution which is independent of the given regularisation procedure for the running coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath37 limit corresponds to the assumption of the very slowly varying qcd coupling ( expansion around the fixed coupling limit ) . using the @xmath0 - expansion , see @xcite , one is able to identify systematically various types of diffusion corrections @xmath42 and specify the radius of convergence for this series given by the parameter @xmath43 , where @xmath44 being the minimum of the bfkl kernel eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked numerically that the perturbative behaviour indeed breaks down at rapidities @xmath45 which can be seen from the above quoted form of the parameter @xmath46 . in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> we show the maximum rapidity for which the perturbative part can be defined using two methods . in the first one , we calculate the solution to the equation ( [ eq : bfkl ] ) with two different regularisations for @xmath24 and </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath47 as the limiting rapidity at which the two solutions start to diverge - dashed line . in the second method we apply the @xmath0-expansion method , and </S>",
    "<S> calculate the perturbative gluon green s function from the following series @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we then truncate this series at different orders and define again @xmath47 as the divergence point . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see from fig.2 that the first method yields linear dependence on @xmath21 which is consistent with formula ( [ eq : ytunnel ] ) and suggest the tunneling as the relevant mechanism for the breakdown of perturbative evaluation . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> , we observe @xmath49 behaviour which is consistent with the prediction based on the critical value @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the perturbative prediction can be in principle made up to the values @xmath50 . </S>"
