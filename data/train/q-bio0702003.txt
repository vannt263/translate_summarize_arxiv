    ", this rate must be much lower than the rates of the relevant processes in the cell , namely transcription , translation , and degradation of transcription factors .",
    "genetic switches , such as the phage @xmath0 switch , give rise to different cell fates @xcite . in this switch , @xmath0 phages infect _ e. coli _ bacteria and can exist in two exclusive states , one called lysogeny and the other called lysis . when the phage enters its host , it integrates itself into the host s dna and is duplicated by cell division .",
    "it codes for proteins that can identify stress in the host cell . in case of stress ,",
    "the phage transforms into the lysis state . in this state",

    "the genetic switch may also serve as a memory unit of the cell , and help determine its fate during cell differentiation .",
    "recent advances enable the construction of genetic circuits with desired properties , that are determined by the network architecture .",
    "these networks are constructed from available components , namely genes and promoters .",
    "they do not require the manipulation of the structure of proteins and other regulatory elements at the molecular level .",
    "these genes and promoters are often inserted into plasmids rather than on the chromosome . a synthetic toggle switch , that consists of two repressible promoters with mutual negative regulation , was constructed in _",
    "e. coli _ and the conditions for bistability were examined @xcite .",
    "the switching between its two states was demonstrated using chemical and thermal induction .",
    "more recently , such circuit was found to exist in a natural system in which two mutual repressors regulate the differentiation of myeloid progenitors into either macrophages or neutrophils @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the genetic toggle switch using deterministic and stochastic methods . in this simple genetic circuit , two proteins , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "negatively regulate each other s synthesis .",
    "the regulation is performed at the transcription level , namely the production of protein @xmath1 is negatively regulated by protein @xmath2 , through binding of @xmath3 copies of @xmath2 to the @xmath1 promoter ( and vice versa ) .",

    "one may expect this circuit to function as a switch , with two stable states , one dominated by @xmath1 proteins and the other dominated by @xmath2 proteins .",

    "this description does not account for the possibility of spontaneous transitions between the two states . in the stochastic description",
    ", spontaneous transitions do take place .",
    "therefore , the condition for bistability is that the rate of spontaneous switching events ( due to random fluctuations rather than an external signal ) is much lower than the rates of all other relevant processes in the system .",

    "the two bistable states appear as two distinct peaks in this distribution .",
    "monte carlo simulations enable to follow the fluctuations in a single cell and to evaluate the rate of spontaneous switching events .",
    "we examine the conditions for the system to become a switch , and calculate the rate of spontaneous transitions between its two states .",
    "this is done for several variants of the toggle switch .",
    "in particular , we focus on switch systems in which the repression in done without cooperative binding ( namely , @xmath7 ) .",
    "numerous studies have concluded , using rate equations , that cooperative binding is a necessary condition for the emergence of bistability @xcite .",
    "below we show , using a combination of deterministic and stochastic simulation methods , that this is not the case , namely a bistable switch can exist even in the absence of cooperative binding .",
    "in particular , we show that bound - repressor degradation ( brd ) and protein - protein interactions ( ppi ) give rise to bistability , without cooperative binding , even at the level of rate equations .",
    "these results are confirmed by stochastic simulations using the master equation and monte carlo methods .",
    "we also consider the exclusive switch , in which the @xmath1 and @xmath2 repressors can not be bound simultaneously due to overlap between their promoter sites .",

    "this may be inefficient in terms of computer time , and the statistical errors may be significant . on the other hand , unlike the master equation , monte carlo simulations enable to follow the time evolution of a single cell and directly evaluate quantities such as switching times and oscillation periods .    the number of equations in the master equation set increases exponentially with the number of proteins and mrnas included in the simulated circuit . as a result ,",
    "the master equation becomes infeasible for complex networks .",
    "recently , we have shown that for reaction networks described by sparse graphs , one can use suitable approximations and dramatically reduce the number of equations @xcite .",
    "a related circuit , the mixed feedback loop , in which @xmath1 is a repressor to @xmath2 and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 proteins bind to form a complex was recently studied using rate equations @xcite .",
    "it was found to exhibit bistability within a range of parameters .",
    "genetic switch systems with mutual repression of two transcription factors , have been studied using a combination of deterministic and stochastic methods .",
    "these system exhibit bistability , namely two stable states such that spontaneous transitions between them are rare . induced transitions take place as a result of an external stimulus .",
    "we have studied several variants of the genetic switch , which exhibit cooperative binding , exclusive binding , protein - protein interactions and degradation of bound repressors . for each variant",
    "we examined the range of parameters in which bistability takes place .",
    "numerous studies have concluded that cooperative binding is a necessary condition for the emergence of bistability in these systems .",
    "we have shown that a suitable combination of network structure and stochastic effects gives rise to bistability even without cooperative binding .",
    "the average time @xmath71 between spontaneous transitions was evaluated as a function of the biological parameters .",
    "hill - function models are simplifications of rate - law equations . when derived directly from rate laws , @xmath3 is expected to take only integer values , which represents the number of transcription factors required to perform the regulation .",
    "however , when these models are used for fitting empirical data , @xmath3 is a fitting parameter which may take non - integer values",
    ".            extended circuits that include the mrna level have also been studied .",
    "it was found that there is a perfect agreement between the results of the res for the simplified and the extended circuits , and excellent agreement with only a slight difference in peak shapes in the me .",
    "results of @xmath71 calculated in this procedure , agree with results obtained from averaging a large number of monte carlo simulations , up to a numerical factor of 2 .",
    "this factor rises from the fact the in the procedure we described the system can also return from the @xmath2 dominated peak to the @xmath1 dominated peak ."
