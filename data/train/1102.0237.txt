    "our interferometric observations of gj  581 were carried out using the georgia state university center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array @xcite in the context of ongoing surveys to determine fundamental parameters of exoplanet hosting stars @xcite and of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "we used the single baseline chara classic beam combiner in @xmath4-band ( @xmath5  @xmath6 m ) and collected data on 6 nights between march and june 2010 .",

    "these calibrator stars were chosen to be near - point - like sources of similar @xmath4-band magnitudes as gj  581 and located at small angular distances from it . the uniform disk and limb - darkened angular diameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ; see table [ tab : properties ] ) are found by fitting the calibrated visibility measurements ( fig .",

    "the fact that we did not find any evidence of a secondary fringe packet ( and thus stellar - mass companion at low inclination angles ) reinforces the dynamical stability argument of coplanar orbits in this system as described in @xcite and @xcite by providing an empirical lower - limit constraint on the orbital inclinations of the planetary orbits .",

    "our recalculation of the boundaries of the gj  581 s hz based on our directly determined host star properties is based on the equations in @xcite and @xcite that relate the radii of the inner and outer edges of the hz to the luminosity and effective temperature of the host star .",
    "this results in an inner boundary of 0.11 astronomical units ( au ) and an outer boundary of slightly above 0.21  au .",
    "to determine which of gj  581 s planets are located in the hz , we calculate their equilibrium temperatures @xmath52 following the methods of @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the stellar energy flux , @xmath55 is the bond albedo , and @xmath48 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",

    "planets d spends part of its orbit in the hz .",
    "it should be noted , that due to the non - zero orbital eccentricity , @xmath52 is a function of time ( or phase angle ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath57 for planet d varies from 229  k at periastron to 154  k at apastron , causing it to periodically dip into and out of the hz .",
    "* scenario 2 : * we take all orbital parameters from @xcite , motivated by the discussion in @xcite , which points out that the rv signal of planet d s eccentric orbit could , in fact , be due to two circular orbits of planets d and g. the geometry of this scenario is illustrated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and table  2 ) and shown here in the right panel of figure [ fig : hz_orbits ] . in this scenario , planet g spends all its their circular orbit in the hz with a semi - major axis of @xmath58  au , while planet d is right on the outer edge of the hz with @xmath59  au . for planet g , an even heat redistribution results in @xmath60  k which is slightly less than the value calculated by @xcite as anticipated from our smaller value for gj  581 s luminosity .",
    "we note that @xmath60  k is below the freezing temperature of water , but does not take into account the greenhouse effect heating due to an atmosphere ( for comparison : earth s @xmath61  k ) .",
    "see section 6 of @xcite and particularly @xcite for more detailed elaborations .",
    "planet d s @xmath62 k for @xmath63 when using its semi - major axis in equation [ eq : equitemp ] .",
    "in this paper , we present directly determined astrophysical parameters of the late - type , multiplanet host star gj  581 , observed as part of our ongoing interferometric survey with the chara array of km dwarfs with and without planets .",
    "we find small but significant differences between literature values and our empirical results for gj  581 , which are explicitly shown in  [ sec : properties ] and table [ tab : properties ] .",
    "we measure a stellar radius that is larger than predicted by theory - based calibrations ( 3% ) but a slightly lower than predicted @xmath17 ( 3.5% ) , resulting in our calculated luminosity s being lower than the currently used literature value ( by @xmath207% ) .",
    "thus , we confirm the results in @xcite that theoretically calculated radii of m dwarfs are smaller than the directly measured counterparts .",
    "we recalculate the boundaries of the system s hz based on our new results .",
    "an analysis of the equilibrium temperatures of the six planets orbiting gj  581 confirms that planet g spends all of its orbit inside the hz .",
    "depending on the assumed eccentricity of planet d s orbit , it periodically dips into and out of the hz or spends all of its circular orbit on its outer edge (  [ sec : habitability ] ) .",
    "the presence of any moderately dense atmosphere around planets d and particularly g could provide sufficient greenhouse heating of the planetary surface temperatures @xcite such that any existing water could be in liquid form .",
    "planetary characterization is playing an increasingly important role in exoplanet research . with the exception of directly imaged planets ,",
    "the large majority of astrophysical exoplanet parameters are functions of stellar parameters , which in turn are , by necessity , calculated on the basis of stellar models . particularly in the low - mass regime , however , these stellar models lack observational constraints , leading , not necessarily by fault of the models themselves , to uncertainties and sometimes systematic discrepancies between theoretical and observational results , as we present in this paper .",
    "it is thus hard to overstate the importance of `` understanding the parent stars '' . with recent and ongoing improvements in both sensitivity and spatial resolution of near - infrared and optical interferometric data quality , we are able to ameliorate this situation and provide firm , direct measurements of stellar radii and effective temperatures in the low - mass regime .",
