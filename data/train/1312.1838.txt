    "accurate generation of low dc current values is of relevance for the calibration of low dc current meters ( picoammeters , femtoammeters ) and for research on electron - counting sources based on single - electron tunneling .",
    "methods based on ohm s law , where a current @xmath0 is generated by applying a dc voltage @xmath1 to a resistor @xmath2 , becomes increasingly impractical for lower and lower currents .",
    "the primary reasons are that very high - valued resistance standards required have high voltage and temperature coefficients , long time constants , are difficult to calibrate ; and that the burden voltage of the instrument under calibration is an important source of error .",
    "recently , several national metrology institutes have developed generators @xcite based on the displacement current in a capacitor , called _ capacitance charging _ method .",
    "a linear voltage ramp @xmath3 , having slope @xmath4 , is applied to a capacitor c ( having capacitance @xmath5 ) , and a current @xmath6 is generated .",
    "appropriate capacitance standards to be employed in the method can be highly stable and can be accurately calibrated ; @xmath4 can be calculated from readings of a sampling voltmeter .",
    "the method is not affected by the ammeter burden voltage , which affects @xmath7 but not its slope @xmath4 .",
    "the capacitor must be a gas - dielectric or vacuum capacitance standard , since all solid - dielectric capacitors show the phenomenon of dielectric absorption @xcite which would severely limit the generator accuracy .",
    "available commercial standard capacitors range from to .",
    "however , capacitances above are likely to cause oscillations in the input stage of the instrument being calibrated @xcite and therefore can not be employed .",
    "the maximum @xmath8 is limited by the maximum voltage @xmath9 available by the ramp generator and the ramp duration @xmath10 , which should be adequate for measurement settling .    in most published generators @xcite , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which in turn limits the maximum available current to when @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ". in one implementation @xcite a maximum current of has been reached at the expense of raising the current slope to @xmath15 , hence reducing the available measurement time to .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate a simple range extender amplifier , that can be connected to an existing ramp generator .",
    "it raises the voltage to the range , and thus permits the extension of the maximum current range of the capacitance - charging method to range .",
    "calibration measurements performed on a top - level instrument are compared with those obtained with ohm s law method .",
    "the measurement setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capsetup ] .",
    "the range extender amplifier e has a @xmath16 gain configuration , and is connected to the existing ramp generator rg @xcite ( having @xmath17 ) .",
    "the ramp voltage @xmath7 , sampled by the voltmeter v ( agilent 3458a , or range ) , is applied to the gas - dielectric capacitor c and converted to a current @xmath0 , measured by the meter under calibration m. the timer t provides a clock pulse to all instruments , which are controlled by a personal computer pc .",

    "diodes give input protection ; resistor to pin 2 fixes the current limiter .",

    "the quantity measured in all experiments is the _ calibration factor _",
    "@xmath18 defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the traceable current generated by the source , @xmath21 is the current reading of m when @xmath20 is applied , @xmath22 the current reading of m when zero current is applied .",
    "the range extender allows the generation of voltage ramps at @xmath23 or higher , having properties very similar to the original ramp at @xmath12 already described in @xcite .",
    "the noise of e is specified as at audio frequency .",
    "analyses of samples acquired at rate when generating a fixed output give a noise increase of rms when e is inserted .",
    "although the input resistance of v is reduced to , it does not constitute a significant load for e.    the standard capacitors c employed are general radio mod .",

    "the units are specified for voltages up to , therefore the @xmath9 increase is well tolerated .",
    "the units are calibrated as two terminal - pair standards @xcite .",
    "the applied voltage during calibration is for and for , and the frequency ; very different conditions than those of the experiment .",
    "a determination of the voltage dependence of these units has not been performed , but it is known that in capacitors of similar construction is below in the rms range @xcite . the frequency dependence is more of concern ; in gas - dielectric capacitors it has been ascribed to surface effects @xcite .",
    "it has been found @xcite that in 1404-c models the ` ac - dc dependence ' , i.e. the capacitance deviation between the very low frequency employed in the experiment ( @xmath24 ) and ( typically below , but with extremes up to ) can be predicted from the measured dependence in the audio frequency range ( @xmath25 ) ; for the item employed , the prediction gives an ac - dc dependence lower than .",

    "two different comparisons have been performed , where m is employed as a transfer standard .",

    "a comparison at , in the two configurations including and excluding the range extender , was made to test the extender on a point already validated through an international intercomparison .",
    "the experiment adds confidence in the assumptions on the electrical behavior of the capacitance standards employed .",
    "the comparison at , versus an implementation of ohm s law method , showed good agreement with comparable uncertainties , so the methods are mutually validated and can both be employed .",
