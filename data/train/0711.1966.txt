    "he analyzed @xmath7 and @xmath8 light curves and showed that the system is most probably contact binary with spotted regions on one of the components .",

    "( 2003 ) reported this star as suspected for variability during their 2mass project .",
    "our photometric observations of the dv psc field has started on september 4 , 2005 and ran to october 26 , 2006 . the system was detected on ccd images from 5 nights in 2005 .",
    "observation field in 2006 was selected in the manner to obtain system during all observations of dv psc .",
    "all these observations were obtained at the star lesn ( sl ) observatory of astronomical institute of the slovak academy of sciences and at the kolonica observatory ( ko ) .",
    "the journal of ccd observations is given in tab .  1 .    for observations from sl observatory",
    "the 50 cm telescope equipped with the sbig st-10 mxe ccd camera with standard @xmath0 filters was used .",

    "the phase interval is determined according to ephemeris ( 2 ) .",
    "observations denoted by * were used only for minima times determination . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the first step , we solved light curves from 2006 , when we assumed that there are no spots on the surface of the stars . according to binnendijk ( 1957 ) dividing of w uma systems into a and w types",
    ", we concluded that this system is a w - type . because of g8 spectral type and short orbital period .",
    "it means , that primary minimum is caused by occultation of the less massive and hotter primary star by more massive but cooler secondary component .",
    "beacause of w - type definition , the mass ratio @xmath9 .    to find correct values of mass ratio @xmath10 and orbital inclination @xmath11 , we computed normalized weighted sum of squares of residuals @xmath12 for fixed values of @xmath10 in interval 1.01.8 and @xmath11 in interval 6090@xmath13 and looked for a global minimum .",
    "a detailed view of the variations of the sum of squares around the global minimum is depicted at fig  2 .",
    "we obtained photometric parameters , which are listed in tab .",
    "the best fits with corresponding o - c for all passbands are depicted in fig .",

    "these parameters were used in the next solution of 2005 light curves .",
    "as was mentioned before , the light curves from this season are affected by maculation .",
    "the process of the searching for the spot s parameters is complicated by the fact that observed oconnell effect could be caused by different combinations of the spot s location ( on primary or secondary component ) and spot s temperature ( hot or cool spot ) . to quantify this effect",
    ", we tried to fit light curves from 2005 for 4 configurations of the spot location and temperature as listed in tab .",
    "4 . in these solutions",
    "we have fixed temperature factor ( ratio between temperature of the spot and surrounding atmosphere ) of the spot as well as parameters from 2006 solution except temperature of secondary component . as could be seen from values of @xmath12 in tab .",
    "4 , to select correct solution is practically impossible . in fig .",

    "our light curve analysis of @xmath0 photometric observations of recently discovered eclipsing binary gsc 00008 - 00901 , which is located in the field of another eclipsing binary dv  psc showed , that this system is an overcontact binary of w  uma type .",
    "considering of its spectral type and orbital period , we concluded that the primary minimum is occultation ( primary component is eclipsed by secondary one ) .",
    "so , this system belongs to an w - type of w uma binaries .",
    "the temperature difference between components is about 350k .    in spite of problems with quality of the observations we showed that light curves from the both seasons 2005 and 2006 are different .",
    "the light curves from 2005 show different brightness in the both maxima , while 2006 light curves are symmetric .",
    "asymmetry of the light curves from 2005 could be explained by the spot on one of the components , however , some conclusions on spot s temperature and/or its location ( on primary or secondary component ) are uncertain .",
