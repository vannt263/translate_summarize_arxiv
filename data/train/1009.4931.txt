    "the currently known diversity of exoplanets is greatly attributable to the revolution of the transit detection method over the past 10 years .",
    "the measurement of radius and hence density were the first steps from the results of this technique , but soon to follow were atmospheric studies from both primary transit and secondary eclipse .",
    "however , the unknown inclination of the planetary orbits makes this technique only applicable to a relatively small fraction of the known exoplanets . for the non - transiting planets , reflected light and phase variations present an additional avenue through which to investigate planetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the net result of this new information has lead to an unprecedented ability to characterize exoplanets .",
    "phase functions in the infra - red ( ir ) primarily measure the thermal properties of the planet whereas optical measurements probe the planetary albedo .",
    "the relation between giant planet atmospheres and phase curves have been described in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite further investigate the time - variation of the atmospheres in the ir for eccentric planets using radiative transfer models .",
    "the phase variation of our own solar system has been investigated by @xcite , and it has been shown that phase functions can be used to produce longitudinal thermal maps of exoplanets @xcite .",
    "in addition , phase curves of terrestrial planets have been considered by @xcite .",
    "phase variations of exoplanets in the ir and optical regimes have had success due to increased access to improved instrumentation and space - based observatories .",
    "this has primarily been investigated for transiting planets since the edge - on orbital plane produces the highest phase amplitude .",
    "examples of observed phase variations in the ir ( using spitzer ) include hd  189733b @xcite and hd  149026b @xcite .",
    "examples in the optical include kepler observations of hat - p-7b @xcite and phase variations detected in the light curve of corot-1b @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that planets in eccentric orbits have inflated transit probabilities , as demonstrated by hd  17156b @xcite and hd  80606b @xcite .",
    "these types of planets will produce relatively high phase amplitudes during a brief period ( periaston passage ) of the orbit .",
    "however , phase variations of non - transiting planets have been restricted to hot jupiters , including @xmath0  and  b @xcite and hd  179949b @xcite .",
    "there have been searches for phase variations of , for example , hd  75289ab @xcite and @xmath1  boo  b @xcite but no signatures were detected in either case .",
    "exploring the atmospheric properties of longer - period planets requires taking advantage of highly - eccentric non - transiting systems .",
    "thus we also constrain the inclination and hence the mass of such planets .    here",
    "we investigate the expected photometric phase amplitude of long - period eccentric planets and show how planetary orbits in resonance can result in ambiguous phase variation detections .",
    "we further apply this analysis by calculating maximum flux ratios for the known exoplanets and considering several interesting case studies .",
    "we also determine the effective orbital phase regime over which detectability is maximised and show how refinement of orbital parameters can allow efficient targeted observations at these times .",
    "this study is intended from an observers point of view in so far as these observable variations can be reconnected back to the theoretical models of exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "in this section , we establish the theoretical framework which will be applied in the remainder of the paper , similar to the formalism used by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "figure [ pha_orbit ] shows a top - down view of an elliptical planetary orbit .",
    "the phase angle @xmath2 is described by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the argument of periastron and @xmath5 is the true anomaly .",
    "the phase angle is defined to be @xmath6 when the planet is at superior conjunction ( `` full '' phase ) . in terms of orbital parameters , this location in the orbit occurs when @xmath7 .    ) , first quarter ( @xmath8 ) , new ( @xmath9 ) , and third quarter ( @xmath10 ) phases.,width=309 ]    the flux at wavelength @xmath11 incident upon the planet is described by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the luminosity of the star and @xmath14 is the star ",
    "planet separation .",
    "this separation is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the semi - major axis and @xmath17 is the orbital eccentricity .",
    "the geometric albedo of a planet is defined at @xmath6 as follows @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reflected light from the planet .",
    "the planetary flux received at earth is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the planetary radius , @xmath22 is the distance to the star , and @xmath23 is the phase function . since the stellar flux received at earth is @xmath24 then the flux ratio of the planet to the host star is defined as @xmath25 and thus contains three major components ; the geometric albedo , the phase function , and the inverse - square relation to the star ",
    "planet separation .",
    "note that for a circular orbit , only the phase function is time dependent .      as noted in the previous section ,",
    "the observed flux ratio from an exoplanet is wavelength dependent . in particular",
    ", the atmospheric composition drives the scattering properties and thus the forms of the geometric albedo and phase function .",
    "this dependence has been considered in great detail by @xcite in which they construct empirical models for exoplanet atmospheres and intergrate over the surface with assumed opacities depending upon atmospheric composition .",
    "this thorough analysis is not reproduced here , but we do use the results of their analysis for a restricted wavelength , particularly with regards to the albedo function discuessed in the following sections . here",
    "we confine our study to optical wavelengths centered on 550  nm .",
    "this broadly encompasses the results obtained by such studies at @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this also places the study near the peak response of the kepler ccd , the relevance of which will be discussed in later sections .",
    "it has been shown through atmospheric models that there is a dependence of the geometric albedo of giant planets on the semi - major axis of the orbit @xcite .",
    "we direct the reader to figure 9 of @xcite which details the wavelength and star  planet separation dependence of the geometric albedo .",
    "jupiter is known to have a visual geometric albedo of @xmath26 .",
    "however , the strong irradition of the atmospheres of giant planets in short - period orbits results in the removal of reflective condensates from the upper atmospheres and thus a significant lowering of the geometric albedo . observations of hd  209458b using the microvariability and oscillations of stars ( most ) satellite by @xcite failed to detect phase variations and thus they were able to place an upper limit of @xmath27 , subsequently investigated using model atmospheres by @xcite .",
    "more recent observations of hat - p-7b using kepler by @xcite revealed phase variations in the light curve from which they were able to deduce a geomtric albedo of 0.18 .    through the examples mentioned above , and the consideration of the theoretical models of @xcite",
    ", we have constructed a model which approximates the albedo of giant planets as a function of star ",
    "planet separation ( see equation [ separation ] ) .",
    "this is a hyperbolic tangential function of the form @xmath28 equation [ albedo ] is plotted in figure [ albedofig ] , showing the semi - major axes of hat - p-7b and jupiter for reference .",
    "this function well represents the rapid rise in optical albedo between 0.2 and 1 au described by @xcite , as well as the continued rise beyond 2 au whereby water clouds begin to be present .",
    "though broadly robust to encompass both the theoretical calculations and the limited number of measured examples mentioned above , this empirical function does not account for planetary gravity whose variation may affect the atmospheric properties and thus the albedo properties .",
    "nm.,width=309 ]      a planetary phase function can be considered to be defined by the continuous presence of an imaginary line conecting the center of the star and planet which is normal to the day ",
    "night terminator of the planet .",
    "the phase function of a lambert sphere assumes the atmosphere isotropically scatters over @xmath29 steradians and is described by @xmath30 and is thus normalized to lie between 0 and 1 . for a circular orbit , the phase function applied this to the flux ratio relation ( equation [ fluxratio ] ) results in both a phase function and flux ratio which are maximum at a phase angle of zero .",
    "generalizing the phase angle ( see equation [ phaseangle ] ) and thus the phase function for an eccentric orbit requires first solving kepler s equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean anomaly and @xmath33 is the eccentric anomaly .",
    "the true anomaly is then related to the eccentric anomaly by @xmath34 where the true anomaly establishes the time - dependent variation of the phase function .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     these calculated values are plotted in figure [ knownexo ] , both as a function of period and eccentricity .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is @xmath36 for all planets in circular orbits since this is where the phase difference for a simple cosine variation crosses the @xmath37% threshold described above . for eccentric orbits @xmath35 can be larger than expected , particularly where @xmath38 .",
    "even so , the distribution shown in the top - left panel of figure [ knownexo ] mirrors the distribution of orbital eccentricities .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows that there is a minimum value of @xmath35 that may occur for a given eccentricity , but once again we see that this can float upwards depending upon the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the evident linear relation in log - space of the flux ratio on period shown in the top - right panel demonstrates that the flux ratio is indeed dominated by the star - planet separation as one would expect",
    ". however , note the significant outliers beyond a period , @xmath39 , of 200 days which are caused by the highly eccentric planets which pass through periastron close to a phase angle of @xmath40 .",
    "several of these systems are discussed in detail in section [ casestudies ] .",

    "the planet with the highest eccentricity , hd  80606b , is also the planet with the highest predicted flux ratio .",
    "this is not surprising considering that this planet s periastron passage is behind the star , leading to the high secondary eclipse probability and the subsequent observation of that eclipse by @xcite .",
    "as described earlier and demonstrated by figure [ knownexo ] , the flux ratios of the planets in table [ phasetable ] are dominated by the period and therefore the semi - major axis of the orbits .",
    "as described by @xcite , the refinement of orbital parameters is not only an essential component for succussful detection of features which only appear for a small fraction of the orbit , it is also achievable with relatively few additional radial velocity measurements .",
    "this is particularly true of long - period planets whose orbits tend to have higher associated uncertainties and for which opportunities to observe at a particular place in the orbit are far less frequent .    for the goal of attempting to detect a planetary transit , it is the time of predicted transit mid - point which needs to be constrained . for optimal observations of phase variations , it is the time span during which the maximum change in flux ratio occurs which needs to be accurately determined , previously defined by the quantity @xmath43 .",
    "the reason for this is because , even though the phase variation occurs over the entire orbit , it is assumed that the high cadence and precision needed will necessitate limited observing time using highly - subscribed instruments ( discussed further in section [ casestudies ] ) .        using the analogy of the transit window described by @xcite",
    ", we introduce the concept of the phase prediction window , which is the time period during which a particular phase of the orbit could occur according to the uncertainties associated with the orbital period and the time of periastron passage . in figure [ phasewin ]",
    "we plot orbital eccentricity as a function of the phase window for the 370 exoplanets for which the necessary uncertainties were available ( 358 ) .",
    "it is clear that the planets with the highest eccentricities are the most difficult cases to predict orbital phase locations .",
    "this is important because the most eccentric orbits tend to have much smaller @xmath35 values and so it is essential that orbital refinement be used to reduce the uncertainty in the phase prediction and hence the size of the associated window .",
    "although the phase function and albedo formulation adopted in this study to compute the expected phase variations are physically motivated , the sample of exoplanets with accurate measurements for these functions is relatively small .",
    "for example , the hilton phase function ( equation [ phase ] ) is based upon the cloud maps of venus and jupiter which , although they produce similar phase functions , have their own unique cloud configurations with resulting slight variations in their respective phase functions . likewise",
    ", real exoplanets could potentially exhibit a range of phase functions and albedo distributions beyond those considered here . as is clear from equation [ fluxratio ] , the flux ratio is linearly dependent on the geometric albedo .",
    "in other words , a 1% change in the value of @xmath44 translates into a 1% change in the value of @xmath41 .",
    "the geometric albedo has no effect on the time between minimum and maximum flux , @xmath35 , since the shape of the phase variation is not altered .     and @xmath41 as a function the percentage variation in the planetary visual magnitude correction ( see equation [ magcorr ] ) for the planets in table [ phasetable].,width=309 ]    a change in the phase function however , will alter both the calculated values of @xmath35 and @xmath41 . in order to quantify this effect , we varied the value of the planetary visual magnitude correction , @xmath45 , as described in equation [ magcorr ] .",
    "this was performed for all of the planets shown in table [ phasetable ] , from which the the mean of the percentage change in @xmath35 and @xmath41 was calculated for those planets .",
    "the results of this simulation are shown in figure [ robustfig ] .",
    "even a substantial change in the phase function of 10% leads to a relatively minor change in the expected value of @xmath35 and an even smaller impact on the expected flux ratio .",
    "additionally , the magnitude of these changes are largest for eccenctric planets which are more sentitive to the location of the peaks in the phase curve .",
    "here we present specific examples of predicted phase amplitudes and detectability for several of the known exoplanets . in evaluating whether these signatures are detectable or",
    "if instead calculating these signatures will remain a theoretical exercise for the immediate future , consider the precision of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the most satellite . both of these telescopes have observed the @xmath46 star hd  209458 .",
    "the hst observations by @xcite achieved a precision of @xmath47 and the most observations by @xcite achieved a precision of @xmath48 . in these cases , the necessarily high cadence resulting from the brightness of the host stars could be used to advantage by binning the data to produce higher precision .",
    "in addition , the ellipsoidal variations detected by @xcite using kepler data is of amplitude @xmath49 .      our current knowledge of the hd  37605 system consists of a single planet in a @xmath50 day , highly eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "this places this planet close to the top of the list shown in table [ phasetable ] .",
    "the peak flux ratio from this planet is expected to be @xmath51 , more than a factor of 10 smaller than that for hat - p-7b .",
    "even so , the peak flux ratio is helped substantially by the periastron argument of @xmath52 which places the periastron passage close to the observer ",
    "star line - of - sight on the far side of the star .",
    "the minimum time between minimum and maximum flux ratio is 0.04 of the orbital phase , or @xmath53 days .",
    "conversely , the phase prediction window for this planet at the time of discovery ( 2004 ) was @xmath54 days . at the time of writing , this window has since grown to @xmath55 days due to the @xmath56 orbits which have occurred since then .",
    "thus , the precision of the orbital parameters require further improvement before a robust attempt to only observe the @xmath35 section of the orbital phase is made .",
    "the hat - p-13 system @xcite is particularly interesting because it consists of an inner transiting planet ( @xmath57 days ) in a circular orbit with an outer companion in a long - period ( @xmath58 days ) eccentric orbit .",
    "additional data acquired by @xcite provide evidence for a third body in the system .",
    "the coplanarity of the system remains in question however since the refined orbital parameters for the outer planet have not yet resulted in a transit detection .",
    "could this be resolved with observations during the predicted maximum flux ratio occurance of the outer planet ?",
    "this will be difficult for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the maximum flux ratio of the inner planet is predicted to be @xmath59 , compared to @xmath60 for the outer planet .",
    "detecting the signature of the outer planet would be a challenging detection task even if the signature of the inner planet were not present .",
    "secondly , since the inclination of the outer planet is not known , the predicted flux ratio becomes an upper limit , potentially making the detection criteria even more dire .",
    "the substantiative dominance of the inner planet over the phase signature makes this far too challenging a task for any current instruments .",
    "the hd  82943 system contains two planets in eccentric orbits in a well - studied 2:1 resonance @xcite .",
    "the inner and outer planets have periods of 219 and 441 days respectively but have near identical maximum flux ratios of @xmath61 ; well beyond the detection limits of current instruments .",
    "the reason for the similarity in the peak flux ratios is due to the orbital elements in the system .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbits combined with the resonance has led to the axes of the orbits being almost @xmath62 out of phase with each other .",
    "this leads to the complex structure for the total flux ratio variation of the system , shown in figure [ hd82943fig ] .",
    "note that the periastron passage of the outer planet occurs behind the star , whereas it occurs in front of the star for the inner planet , yielding a relative increase in the maximum flux ratio for the outer planet , partially compensating for the larger semi - major axis .",
    "current generation space - missions are already detecting exoplanet phase variations in the optical ( eg . , kepler ) and the ir ( eg . , spitzer ) .",
    "the steps these produce towards characterizing the atmospheres of these exoplanets are significant since they provide direct measurements of the atmospheric albedo and thermal properties .",
    "this has currently been primarily undertaken for short - period planets since many of these transit and produce phase varations on easily observable timescales .",
    "however , current radial velocity surveys are biased towards planets whose orbits are closer to edge - on , since larger semi - amplitude signatures are produced , and therefore biased towards planets with larger predicted phase amplitudes .",
    "we have shown here how time and position dependent functions for the geometric albedo and phase can be used to describe expected phase variations for long - period eccentric giant planets .",
    "there is a clear degeneracy with orbital inclination and resonace when considering multi - planet systems and care must be taken to account for these possibilities . applying these results to the known exoplanets",
    "shows that many long - period eccentric planets can have significant peak flux ratios , comparable to those of short - period planets .",
    "additionally , the phase prediction windows of eccentric planets , during which observations will be optimally placed , will tend to be poorly contrained .",
    "the refinement of orbital parameters for the known exoplanets is clearly a key component for optimal observations of the eccentric planets during maximum phase amplitude . improving the measured orbits of long - period planets",
    "is already being undertaken by such projects as the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) @xcite .",
    "however , most of the predicted flux ratios for the known planets push heavily against the boundaries of what is achievable with current ground and space - based instruments .",
    "a thorough search of all these planets will therefore likely need to await future generation telescopes , such as the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) , and the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .    as more science results are released by the kepler mission",
    ", the study of photometric phase variations of long - period planets will become increasingly relevant .",
    "not only is it an existing mission which has already detected phase variations in the light curve of hat - p-7b , it is specifically looking for transiting planets where there is an a priori knowledge that the orbital inclination is favorable towards maximum phase amplitude .",
    "additionally , kepler will eventually detect transiting long - period ( @xmath63 days ) planets where the bias will certainly be towards eccentric orbits since those have a higher probability of transiting @xcite .",
    "these future discoveries will be prime candidates to detect the phase variations described here .",
    "the authors would like to thank david ciardi for several useful discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee , whose comments greatly improved the quality of the paper .",
    "this research has made use of the exoplanet orbit database and the exoplanet data explorer at exoplanets.org .",
