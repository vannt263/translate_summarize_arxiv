    "the standard approach ( sa ) for description of the structure function @xmath0 involves the dglap evolution equations@xcite and standard fits@xcite for the initial parton densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the fits are defined from phenomenological considerations at @xmath7 and @xmath8gev@xmath9 .",
    "the dglap equations are one - dimensional , they describe the @xmath1 -evolution only , converting @xmath5 and @xmath6 into the evolved distributions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "they represent @xmath0 at the region * a * : @xmath12    the @xmath2 -evolution is supposed to come from convoluting @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the coefficient functions @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the leading order @xmath14 ; the nlo corrections account for one- or two- loop contributions and neglect higher loops .",

    "@xmath13 do no include the total resummation of leading logarithms of @xmath2 ( ll ) , so there are not theoretical grounds to exploit dglap at small @xmath2 .",
    "however regardless of that , sa extrapolates dglap into the region * b * , invoking special fits for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . a general structure of such fits ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) is as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a normalization constant ; @xmath20 , so @xmath4 is singular when @xmath21 and @xmath22 is regular in @xmath2 at @xmath23 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the role of the factor @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ fits ] ) is to mimic accounting for the total resummation of ll performed in refs  @xcite .",
    "similarly to ll , the factor @xmath4 provides the steep rise to @xmath0 at small @xmath2 and sets the regge asymptotics for @xmath0 at @xmath23 , with the exponent @xmath24 being the intercept .",
    "the presence of this factor is very important for extrapolating dglap into the region * b : * when the factor @xmath4 is dropped from eq .",
    "( [ fits ] ) , dglap stops to work at @xmath25 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail ) .",
    "accounting for the ll resummation is beyond the dglap framework because ll come the phase space violating the base of dglap : the dglap -ordering @xmath26 for the ladder partons .",

    "in contrast , eq .  ( [ order ] ) is not sensitive to the value of @xmath1 and therefore the total resummation of ll does make sense in the region * c*. in ref .",

    "@xcite and used after that by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , being based on different phenomenological considerations . on the contrary",
    ", our approach is based on the analysis of the feynman graphs contributing to @xmath0 .",
    "the compass collaboration now measures the singlet @xmath64 at @xmath65 and @xmath66  gev@xmath67 , i.e. in the kinematic region beyond the reach of dglap . however , our formulae for @xmath36 and @xmath64 obtained in refs .",

    "such a resummation leads to the expressions for the coefficient functions different from the dglap ones .",
    "after that the singular factors in the fits can be dropped and the initial parton densities can be approximated by constants : @xmath79 so , one can write @xmath80 with @xmath81 . ~\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath82 depends on the ratio @xmath83 .",
    "the results for different values of the ratio @xmath84 , @xmath82 are plotted in fig .",
    "when the gluon density is neglected , i.e. @xmath85 ( curve  1 ) , @xmath82 being positive at @xmath86 , is getting negative very soon , at @xmath87 and falls fast with decreasing @xmath74 . when @xmath88 ( curve  2 ) , @xmath82 remains positive and not large until @xmath89 , turns negative at @xmath90 and falls afterwards rapidly with decreasing @xmath74 .",
    "this turning point where @xmath82 changes its sign is very sensitive to the magnitude of the ratio @xmath91  .",
    "for instance , at @xmath92 ( curve  3 ) , @xmath82 passes through zero at @xmath93 . when @xmath94 , @xmath82 is positive at any experimentally reachable @xmath74 ( curve  4 )  .",
    "therefore , the experimental measurement of the turning point would allow to draw conclusions on the interplay between the initial quark and gluon densities .",

    "( [ gnsbc ] ) into series in @xmath96 and represent @xmath97 as follows :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is given by eq .  ( [ gnsint ] ) ; for explicit expressions for the factors @xmath100 see ref .",
    "the power terms in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ gnshtw ] ) look like the power @xmath35 -corrections and therefore the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ gnshtw ] ) can be interpreted as the total resummation of such corrections .",
    "these corrections are of the perturbative origin and have nothing in common with higher twists contributions ( @xmath101 ) .",

    "( [ dglaphtw ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ gnshtw ] ) leads to an obvious conclusion : for estimating genuine higher twists contributions to @xmath36 , one should account , in the first place , for the perturbative power corrections predicted by eq .",
    "( [ gnshtw ] ) ; otherwise the estimates can not be reliable .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we can easily explain the empirical observation made in the conventional analysis of experimental data : the power corrections exist for @xmath103 gev@xmath9 and disappear when @xmath104 gev@xmath9 . indeed , in eq .",
    "( [ gnshtw ] ) @xmath105 gev , so the expansion in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ gnshtw ] ) make sense for @xmath103 gev@xmath9 only ; at lesser @xmath1 it should be replaced by the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ gnsbc ] ) in @xmath106 .",
    "resummation of the leading logarithms of @xmath2 is the straightforward and most natural way to describe @xmath0 at small @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to dglap , our approach is not sensitive to the value of @xmath1 and allows one to describe @xmath0 at small @xmath2 and arbitrary @xmath1 in terms of the same expressions at large and small @xmath1 .",
    "we have used it for studying the @xmath0 singlet at small @xmath1 because this kinematic is presently investigated by the compass collaboration .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 in this region depends on @xmath63 only and practically does not depend on @xmath2 , even at @xmath33 .",
    "numerical calculations show that the sign of @xmath0 is positive at @xmath74 close to 1 and can remain positive or become negative at smaller @xmath74 , depending on the ratio between @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is plotted in fig .  1 for different values of @xmath107 .",
    "1 demonstrates that the position of the sign change point is sensitive to the ratio @xmath107 , so the experimental measurement of this point would enable to estimate the impact of @xmath6 .",
    "the alternative to the resummation is extrapolating dglap from its natural region of applicability ( large @xmath2 and large @xmath1 ) into the region of small @xmath2 and large @xmath1 . as the dglap equations can not account for the ll resummation , sa mimics the resummation through the special choice of the fits for the initial parton densities : the singular factors in the fits cause the steep rise of @xmath0 at small @xmath2 and provide the regge asymptotics for @xmath0 ( however with the incorrect phenomenological intercepts ) when @xmath23 .",
    "they should be dropped when the total resummation of ll of @xmath2 is taken into account .",
    "the remaining , regular @xmath2-terms of the dglap fits ( the function @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ fits ] ) ) can obviously be replaced by much simpler expressions , so the number of phenomenological parameters in the fits can be reduced from 5 to 2 or even 1 . to conclude , let us notice that extrapolating dglap into the small-@xmath2 region , though provides a satisfactory agreement with experimental data , leads to various wrong statements .",
    "we enlisted the most of them in a recent ref .",
    "below we mention two more such wrong statements :    * statement 1 : * _ the @xmath1-power corrections stem from higher twists @xmath0 and can be measured as the discrepancy between the dglap predictions and the data .",
    "_ this statement is wrong as shown in the previous sect .",
    "* statement 2 : * _ the impact of the ll resummation on the small-@xmath2 behavior of @xmath0 is small .",
    "_ this statement appears when the resummation has been included into the dglap expressions where the fits contain singular factors .",
    "such inclusion is inconsistent and means actually a double counting of the ll contributions : once through the fits and secondly in the explicit way . it also affects the small-@xmath2 asymptotics of @xmath0 , leading to the incorrect values of the intercepts of @xmath0 ( see ref .",
