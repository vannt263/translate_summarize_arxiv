    "the big bang cosmology has been greatly successful in explaining the evolution of the universe . however , despite its success",
    ", it falls short in describing underlying nature of some fundamental physics problems .",
    "for example , three of the leading unsolved mysteries include cosmic inflation , dark matter and dark energy , whose underlying descriptions remain yet unknown . in attempting to solve",
    "some ( all ) of the problems , cosmologists and gravitational physicists have sought out the possible modifications of the einstein gravity on the cosmic scales . among many scenarios , theories that include an additional scalar field",
    "provide compelling candidates for alternative theories of gravity",
    ". in general , the modifications may introduce new gravitational degrees of freedom in addition to the metric tensor and can be in principle described by a scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "however , in any non - degenerate theory that time derivative of fundamental dynamical variable is higher than second order , there exist a linear instability , or ostrogradski s instability .",
    "such instabilities whose hamiltonian is not bounded from below lead to negative norm states or negative energy states which in higher derivative theories are terminologically called ghost - like . besides , theories with ghostlike degrees of freedom provide inconsistencies with the experimental tests . to avoid the presence of the ostrogradski instability , the euler - lagrange equations have to be at most second - order .",
    "until recently , it turns out that very successful models of modified gravity can be described in terms of a class of horndeski s scalar - tensor theory @xcite . in spite of the existence of the derivative interactions ,",
    "the horndeski s theory is known as the most general scalar - tensor theory in four dimensions with one scalar degree of freedom whose equations of motion are kept up to second order in time and spatial derivatives and therefore they are deprived of the ostrogradski s instability .",
    "the horndeski s theory has been investigated so far for various cosmological purposes , e.g. dark energy @xcite , screening mechanisms @xcite and also inflation @xcite . in attempting to generalizations",
    ", we may consider a scenario that the scalar field is directly coupled to the matter sector . in this case , matter does not follow geodesics associated with the gravitational metric @xmath2 but instead with another metric @xmath3 that in the simplest situation they are related via @xmath4 which is known as the conformal transformation ( or coupling ) @xcite . here",
    "it is worth noting that the matter frame metric @xmath3 can be constructed by the purely gravitational one @xmath2 and only one scalar field @xmath0 , but not by the derivatives of the scalar field itself .",
    "the gravity and matter frames , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are often referred to as the einstein and jordan frames , respectively .",
    "as the most general vistas of the scalar - tensor theory , the matter frame metric which is conformally constructed from the gravitational metric and the scalar field itself can also be further generalized by adding the derivatives of the scalar field . since the higher derivative terms in the equations of motion give rise to ghost - like instabilities associated with the ostrogradski s theorem , the simplest viable case is to keep only the first order derivatives of the scalar field , _",
    "viz_. ; @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the covariant derivative of the scalar field associated with the gravity frame @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "note that the above relation is often called the disformal transformation . in the present work we will restrict ourself to the simpler argument in which the disformally - transformed gravitational sector belongs to a subset of the horndeski class @xcite , namely ; @xmath8 for @xmath9 , eq([disfort ] )",
    "reduces to the ordinary conformal transformation and its consequences have been well - established , at least when it depends on @xmath0 only , while when @xmath10 , @xmath11 features the pure disformal transformation .",
    "regarding the scalar - tensor theory with the disformal coupling , there are plenty of compelling applications in the cosmological problems .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref.@xcite showed that the disformal transformations are very useful to devise models of the dark sector .",
    "in particular , inflationary models have also been investigated in contexts of the disformal coupling @xcite .    however , another crucial issue for successful models of inflation is the ( pre)reheating mechanism . in this work ,",
    "we anticipate to investigate this mechanism for an inflationary model with the presence of a disformal coupling between two scalar fields .",
    "the reheating and preheating mechanisms for inflationary models in which the couplings between inflaton and matter fields are induced from conformal transformation have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the reheating process in inflationary scenario with disformal coupling between inflaton and other scalar field has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the preheating process due to the direct kinetic coupling between inflaton and other scalar field has been investigated in @xcite .",

    "we summarize our findings in the last section .",
    "we will here start by deriving the set of transformations relating background fields of a disformally coupled theory .",
    "the full action for our model is described by the following action ( in planck units ) : @xmath13 - \\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-{\\tilde g}}\\big[\\frac{1}{2}{\\tilde g}^{\\mu\\nu}\\chi_{,\\mu}\\chi_{,\\nu } + v(\\chi)\\big]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] bearing in mind that the model can be seen as a scalar - tensor theory in the einstein frame coupled to matter fields that propagate on a physical metric denoted by @xmath14 .",

    "however , an interesting special case of this parametrisation is when @xmath40 and the couplings become constants , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . inspired by string theory , the scale @xmath43 can be identified with the ( inverse ) tension of the 3-brane ( @xmath44 ) whose an associated disformal mass scale @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 @xcite .    for model of inflation",
    ", the authors of ref.@xcite discovered that fields with sub - planckian initial conditions can drive large amounts of inflation in the presence of a large enough disformal coupling .",
    "here they used @xmath40 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 which corresponds to a mass scale of @xmath49 .",

    "however , we will see in the following section that the disformal coupling terms can drive parametric resonance in the preheating process as long as the term @xmath50 is not much smaller than unity although @xmath51 .",

    "we specialize the klein - gordon equations for the fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 to a cosmological background and find respectively @xmath52 \\frac{c'}{c } - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\gamma^{2 } - 1\\right)\\rho_{\\chi}\\frac{d'}{d}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath53\\dot{\\phi}\\dot{\\chi } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 here , the energy density @xmath55 and pressure @xmath56 of the field @xmath1 are respectively given by @xmath57 from the einstein equation given in the previous section , we obtain the friedmann equation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the hubble parameter .      in order to examine whether the disformal coupling can influence preheating process",
    ", we study the evolution of the inflaton field @xmath0 and @xmath22 during inflationary stage by firstly assuming that the matter field @xmath1 has no contribution to the dynamics of inflation . in the case where the contribution from the field @xmath1 can be neglected and @xmath60 , eq.([kgphi ] )",
    "becomes @xmath61 under the slow - roll evolution , it follows from eq.([h2 ] ) that @xmath62 and therefore the above equation becomes @xmath63 since @xmath64 is required for slow - roll evolution , the above equation implies that @xmath65 during inflation . from eq.([gamma ] ) , we see that @xmath66 becomes infinite in the limit when @xmath67 .",
    "thus we have either @xmath68 or @xmath69 through out the evolution of the universe .",

    "substituting @xmath70 from eq.([slowroll ] ) into eq.([gamma ] ) , we find that @xmath22 is larger when @xmath72 gets closer to unity .",
    "according to the observational bound @xmath73 @xcite , @xmath22 will significantly larger than unity if @xmath74 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath22 is set by @xmath75 to ensure that the contribution from @xmath1 on dynamics of inflation can be neglected . in the following ,",
    "we quantify the inflationary trajectory in two separate cases .",
    "since @xmath70 is nearly constant during inflation , the simplest situation in which @xmath22 is large until the end of inflation is that a ratio @xmath77 is constant .",
    "it follows from eq.([dc ] ) that the ratio @xmath77 is constant when @xmath78 , which includes the case of constant @xmath12 and @xmath11 if @xmath79 .",
    "since the universe stops acceleration , i.e. , inflation ends , when @xmath80 , we find that @xmath70 drops by factor @xmath81 at the end of inflation . here",
    ", @xmath82 is the value of the inflaton field at the end of inflation .",
    "hence , we expect that at the end of inflation , the term @xmath83 is in the same order of magnitude with that during inflation .",
    "we will see that this term can contribute to the parametric resonance process .",
    "in addition to the case of a constant @xmath77 , a large @xmath22 at the end of inflation can also be obtained if @xmath77 increases when @xmath0 decreases .",
    "since @xmath0 decreases near the end of inflation , the behavior of @xmath77 implies that although @xmath51 during inflation , @xmath22 can become larger when the value of @xmath0 significantly drops around the end of inflation .",
    "this situation corresponds to the case where @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "after the end of inflation , @xmath70 oscillates with decreasing amplitude . to estimate the amplitude of @xmath22 and @xmath87 during preheating period",
    ", we examine eq.([kgphia ] ) numerically by setting @xmath88 and setting @xmath89 as well as @xmath90 at the initial time of inflation .",

    "supposing that the process of parametric resonance is at the stage in which the backreaction of the created particle can be neglected .",
    "however , as already mentioned in ref.@xcite , the backreaction of the quantum field @xmath1 to the dynamics of the inflaton field will be relevant if its occupation numbers have grown sufficiently and then can inhibit the resonance particle production .",
    "we will also leave this interesting topic for our future investigation .",
    "another word of saying , we are interested in an epoch at which the inflaton is dominant , so that the evolution equation for @xmath0 during preheating is also given by eq.([kgphia ] ) .",
    "it is trivial to figure out the solution of eq.([kgphia ] ) during preheating .",
    "simply , we use for a power - law evolution of a scale factor @xmath101 and equation of motion becomes : @xmath102 the general solution of the effective equation of @xmath0 can be basically expressed in terms of the bessel functions as @xmath103\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are constants depending on the initial conditions at the end of inflation , and @xmath106 are bessel functions of order @xmath107 , with @xmath108 .",
    "it is well known that the second term of eq.([sophi ] ) diverges in the limit @xmath109 . therefore , keeping the first term is good enough for the estimate purpose .",
    "the physical solution to eq.([kgphiat ] ) is then reduced to : @xmath110 for a large argument expansion of fractional bessel functions such that @xmath109 , the physical solution can be approximately by a cosinusoidal function , see ref.@xcite : @xmath111 here we can choose a constant @xmath104 by considering the oscillatory behavior which starts just at the end of inflation .",
    "as already mentioned above , the field value at the end of inflation is approximately given by @xmath112 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the energy and pressure densities associated to the physical solution ( [ sophi ] ) are given , after averaging over several oscillations , by @xmath113   = \\frac{1}{2}m^{2}_{\\phi}z^{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & p_{\\phi } \\approx \\left<\\frac{1}{2}{\\dot \\phi}^{2 } + \\frac{1}{2}m^{2}_{\\phi}\\phi^{2}\\right >   \\approx \\frac{1}{2}m^{2}_{\\phi}z^{2}\\left[\\left<\\sin^{2}(m_{\\phi}t - 3p\\pi/4)\\right > - \\left<\\cos^{2}(m_{\\phi}t - 3p\\pi/4)\\right>\\right ]   = 0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath114 .",
    "since the averaged pressure is fairly negligible @xmath115 , eq([omega ] ) implies that @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "using the above approximations , the physical solution is finally expressed as @xmath118     as given in eq.([sophif ] ) .",

    "we may also expect during this early phase of oscillation that the field s kinetic energy is roughly equal to its potential energy , and hence we can estimate the energy density of the field to be @xmath123 . this approximation allows us to further estimate the hubble parameter and we find that the hubble rate would then be @xmath124 .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate the preheating mechanism in a disformally - coupled inflationary model where the scalar field @xmath0 ( which is the inflaton field ) naturally coupled to another matter field @xmath1 induced by the disformal transformation . in the present scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of novel derivative interactions mixing the kinetic terms of the fields is natural . </S>",
    "<S> we start by deriving the evolution of the background system and then quantify how the disformal coupling influences inflationary trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the particle production due to parametric resonances in the models and find in minkowski space that the stage of parametric resonances can be described by the standard mathieu equation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly in our analysis , we discover that broad resonances can be typically achieved and are potentially efficient causing the particle number density in this process to exponentially increase . </S>",
