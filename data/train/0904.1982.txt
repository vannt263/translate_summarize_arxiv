    "quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) evaluations of imaginary time path integrals @xcite have improved to the point where they constitute one of the basic techniques of condensed matter physics . even for fermionic problem , where the sign problem precludes direct simulation ,",
    "the theoretical developments associated with single - site @xcite and cluster @xcite dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) have enabled a powerful approximate solution in terms of a quantum impurity model which for not too large clusters is sign - free or at least has a tractable sign problem . however , while the qmc methods have proven to be very powerful in the study of static expectation values , obtaining dynamical information has remained challenging .",
    "the available techniques are based either on an exact diagonalization ( ed ) method,@xcite where the number of states which contribute to a given response function is so small that level spacings become an issue , or on the analytic continuation of imaginary - time data,@xcite which involves a host of other uncertainties .",
    "the difficulties appear with particular force in the context of the question of whether the high-@xmath1 cuprates are mott insulating materials.@xcite recent work has suggested that the value of the gap and the form of the conductivity in the above - gap region provide important insights into the physics of mott and charge - transfer insulators.@xcite a question of particular interest is the change in gap value associated with onset of antiferromagnetic order in a mott insulator .",
    "one recent paper argued in favor of negligible changes , @xcite while another argued for a large change .",
    "@xcite however , determining with precision the gap value in theoretical model of correlated material is not straightforward .",
    "[ intro ] illustrates some of the uncertainties .",
    "it shows three estimations of the local spectral function ( many body density of states ) for a theoretical model ( described more fully below ) of a mott insulator : one obtained by an ed method and two obtained by maximum entropy ( maxent)@xcite analytic continuation of imaginary time qmc data .",
    "while the qualitative structure of the three estimations appear consistent , there are significant differences of detail , including a factor of two in the size of the gap which makes it difficult to compare the theoretical results to data .",
    "in this paper we present a critical examination of different methods of determining the spectral function of a mott insulator , and apply the results to the question of the gap value , spectral function and optical conductivity in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the two dimensional square lattice hubbard model .",
    "we study maxent analytic continuation of the green s function and of the self - energy , and compare the results to ed calculations and to direct thermodynamic evaluations of the gap .",
    "we argue that continuation of the self energy provides the best method of minimizing the broadening effect of maxent procedure .",
    "the self energy is also needed for computation of other response functions , for example the optical conductivity .",
    "we establish that for @xmath0 near the mott critical value the onset of antiferromagnetism increases the gap of the half filled square lattice hubbard model by about @xmath2 relative to that of the paramagnetic case , thus increases the gap by about 80% .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we define the model to be studied and the methods of solution , discuss maxent and in particular its application to the self - energy .",
    "section [ results ] presents a detailed analysis of the results from analytic continuation and also summarizes the interpretation of exact diagonalization data in light of these results .",
    "section [ cond ] discusses the optical conductivity and section [ conclusion ] is a summary and conclusion .",
    "we study the two dimensional hubbard model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "we choose the chemical potential @xmath5 such that the electron density @xmath6 .",
    "we shall be interested in the imaginary part of the real - axis electron green s function .    to solve the model we employ the single - site dynamical mean field approximation @xcite which makes the approximation that the self energy is a function of frequency only @xmath7 . on this assumption eq .",
    "may be mapped on to a quantum impurity model with parameters determined by a self - consistency condition .",
    "the essential computational task is to solve the quantum impurity model to obtain the local green s function @xmath8 and self energy @xmath9 .",
    "we have used two methods : a recently developed hybridization expansion continuous - time qmc procedure @xcite and an ed method@xcite .",
    "the ed method approximates physical response functions as a series of poles .",
    "the qmc methods produces estimates of green s functions and self energies in imaginary time .",
    "one must then analytically continue the qmc results to obtain physically relevant real frequency quantities . to perform the analytic continuation we used the maxent methods pioneered in the condensed matter physics context by gubernatis and co - workers _ et al_.@xcite    the qualitative behavior of the model is well understood . for @xmath6 and any @xmath10 , the ground state is antiferromagnetically ordered , and the single particle spectrum is characterized by a gap , @xmath11 , which we would like to compute . for @xmath12",
    "there is a gap in the spectrum even if antiferromagnetism is suppressed , and we are also interested in the value of this gap , and in the behavior of the spectral functions for frequencies near the gap edge .    to analyze the situation more precisely we note that in an insulator we expect @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "we may write the green s function ( in general a matrix ) as @xmath15 @xmath16 either when @xmath17 or , regardless of the value of @xmath18 , if the `` quasiparticle equation '' @xmath19=0 \\label{qpeqn}\\ ] ] is satisfied for some momentum @xmath20 .    in the single - site dmft the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase quasiparticle equation",

    "this is given in terms of the momentum - integrated spectral function @xmath34 for spin @xmath35 by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fermi function .",
    "if the spectral function changes smoothly with @xmath33 then for @xmath33 only slightly larger than @xmath38 we would have , at @xmath39 @xmath40 so that @xmath41 would change from 1 when @xmath42 . however , it is known @xcite that in the pm mott insulating region of the single - site dmft , the spectral function changes nontrivially with chemical potential , introducing `` in - gap '' states so that @xmath32 begins to differ from unity at @xmath43 with @xmath44 a number of order unity .",
    "it is not known whether this phenomenon occurs in the afm phase .",

    "we shall show that a reliable determination of gap size does not change with reasonable variance of @xmath58 .",
    "the feature of our work is the direct continuation of the self energy which is related to the full green s function @xmath76 and the noninteracting green s function @xmath77 by @xmath78    in the hubbard model , the self energy has the following asymptotic behavior:@xcite @xmath79    if the hartree term @xmath80 is subtracted the remaining is just like the green s function with a different normalization @xmath81 .",
    "we also introduce the cutoff frequency @xmath82 to avoid the error in high frequencies and replace the self energy with frequencies above @xmath82 by its known asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus frequencies above @xmath82 will not be included in the maxent procedure and their value should be correctly reproduced if we satisfy the normalization condition .",

    "we see that pm optical conductivity has a gap @xmath147 and a relatively soft edge , while in afm phase it has a gap of @xmath148 and a sharp edge .",
    "this is a consequence of the large change in gap due to antiferromagnetism .",
    "the high-@xmath1 cuprates are believed to be described by @xmath149ev ( this value is for example the average of the even and odd parity values quoted in the table in section 7 of ref .  ) .",
    "our result would imply that if @xmath0 in the cuprates were of the order of @xmath150 the optical gap would be about 2.9ev , rather larger than the observed @xmath151ev .",
    "to conclude , we have presented a method to find the gap size from qmc dmft calculations .",
    "we first continue the measured @xmath101 to @xmath9 , using maxent with the correctly estimated correlation matrix , and select @xmath58 from the peak in the posterior probability @xmath68 . we then plot @xmath152 and find the lowest positive solutions to the quasiparticle equation .",
    "curves corresponding to different values of @xmath58 may give slightly different estimates , but this variation has been found to be small . we find that within our numerical accuracy the gap edge is defined by the quasiparticle equation eq .",
    "so ( at least within the single - site dmft ) there are no `` in - gap '' excited states arising from e.g. an excitonic binding between a particle and a spin wave . in the paramagnetic phase doping produces `` in - gap '' states ; we have established that the shift is about @xmath153 at @xmath154 .    for the @xmath155 hubbard model on the square lattice",
    ", we found a half gap size of @xmath118 in the pm phase and @xmath128 in afm phase .",
    "thus for @xmath154 antiferromagnetic order increases the gap relative to that of the paramagnetic solution by about @xmath156 .",
    "this has been qualitatively noted in ref .   and ref .   which applied ed and qmc respectively to a model with a semicircular density of states , but our method provides a reliable quantitative result for the square lattice model .",
    "our finding supports the conclusions of ref .   that @xmath0 must be somewhat less than the mott critical value in the cuprates .",
    "the difference of gap size is also apparent in the calculated optical conductivity , in particular the afm optical conductivity is remarkably sharp near the gap edge , and has a corresponding sharp feature at the upper edge of the upper hubbard band .",
