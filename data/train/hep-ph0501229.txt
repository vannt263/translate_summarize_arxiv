    "recently , the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) has made great simplifications on the proof of factorization in b meson decays @xcite and high energy hard scattering processes @xcite , including resummation of large logarithms in certain regions of phase space , for example , @xmath0 annihilation into two jets of thrust @xmath1 @xcite , the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in the threshold region @xmath2 @xcite and drell - yan ( dy ) process in the case of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the reason for these facts is that scet can be viewed as an operator realization of the pqcd analysis when the modes participating the interactions of interest are soft and collinear , just like chiral dynamics vs qcd at low energy region .",
    "this effective field theory ( eft ) provides a simple and systematic method for factorization of hard , collinear and usoft or soft degrees of freedom at operator level , especially usoft modes can be decoupled from collinear modes in the lagrangian at leading order by making a field redefinition , and the large double logarithms such as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are two typical scales that characterize a process , can be resummed naturally through the running of renormalization group equation ( rge ) .",
    "however , all the above works have not discussed the transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) distributions of high energy hard scattering processes . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the resummed @xmath6 distributions @xcite , taking the higgs - boson production via gluon fusion in small @xmath6 region @xcite as an example , within the framework of scet .",
    "it can be seen that in scet the @xmath6 resummation formula automatically separates the process - dependent wilson coefficient and universal anomalous dimension of the effective operator in a process , which once has been studied by the authors of @xcite within the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) frame .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we start by reviewing the basic steps for factorization and resummation in scet . in section iii",
    "we apply it to derive the @xmath6 distribution at small @xmath6 region directly , which confirms the css formula . in section iv",
    ", we also discuss a similar formula for joint resummation .",
    "section v contains our concluding remarks .",
    "the details of calculation are given in appendix .",
    "scet is appropriate for the kinematic regions of collinear and usoft ( soft ) modes with momenta scaling : @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scaling parameter , and the light - like vectors @xmath11 , @xmath12 satisfy @xmath13 , and the perpendicular components of any four vector @xmath14 are defined by @xmath15 .    in constructing scet , one should first identify the scaling of all possible modes of initial and final states with soft and collinear degrees of freedom , then integrate other degrees of freedom , and the remaining modes must reproduce all the infrared physics of the full theory in the region where scet is valid , which is ensured by the method of regions for feynman integrals with massless quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the eft describing the usoft(soft ) and collinear modes is known as scet@xmath16 , and to distinguish the two theories , the scaling parameter corresponding to scet@xmath17 is denoted by @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    the elements of scet@xmath21 consist of usoft sectors \\{@xmath22 } and collinear sectors \\{@xmath23 } moving in the @xmath24-direction , which are expanded as @xmath25 where @xmath26 resides in the space - time dependence of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is called label momentum , and the label operators @xmath30 , @xmath31 are defined by picking out @xmath32 , @xmath33 momenta for collinear fields @xmath34 for collinear fields will be used for convenience . ] , respectively . the wilson line for @xmath24-collinear fields has the form of @xmath35,\\ ] ] which is required to ensure collinear gauge invariance .",

    "we will only consider the case of head - on jets corresponding to collinear particles moving in the @xmath24 and @xmath61 directions .",
    "since the effective theory only takes account the interactions of the modes in the local way , the lagrangian of the effective theory contains no direct coupling of collinear particles moving in the two separate directions , however the usoft gluons can mediate between them in scet@xmath42 .",
    "hence the lagrangian in this case can be written by @xmath62 and the soft parts are unchanged , so the decoupling transformations are also valid here .",

    "furthermore , the self energy diagrams in full qcd with massless quarks are also vanish , and all the wave function renormalization constants and the residues of the related propagators are equal to unity , and we also note that the conserved current in full qcd needs not to be renormalized .",

    "we conclude this section with a chain for the off - shell case , @xmath120 .",
    "now we are ready to turn into the @xmath121 resummation in the following .",

    "if we set @xmath139 with @xmath140 , the situation is much like that of quark form factor-(a ) discussed in last section , and the matching and running procedure can be followed .",
