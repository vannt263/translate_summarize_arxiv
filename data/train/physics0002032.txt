    "it can be observed that at this wave number although the radial component of the wiggler field at the first harmonic @xmath45 is much larger than the third harmonic @xmath46 , the transverse velocity coefficients of the third harmonic @xmath92 are larger than @xmath93 .",
    "this shows that the third harmonic may have considerable effects around the second magnetoresonance at @xmath94 . away from this resonance eq .",

    "the initial orbit radius is taken at @xmath97 cm and the cyclotron frequency is chosen around the first magnetoresonance at @xmath104 .",
    "large radial excursions of electrons for group ii orbits make the transverse velocity strongly affected by the radial dependency of the wiggler field . the amplitude is also modulated in space with the wavelength of around @xmath105 cm .",

    "harmonic gyroresonance of electrons in the combined helical wiggler and axial guide magnetic field is reported by chu and lin @xcite . in their analysis",
    "the relativistic single particle equation of motion is used with the axial velocity as well as the axial magnetic field of the wiggler averaged along the axial direction . by assuming near steady - state orbits for off - axis electrons they found that the radial variation of the wiggler magnetic field produces a harmonic structure in the transverse force .",
    "this force , in turn , comprises oscillations at all harmonics of @xmath108 .",
    "it should be noted that there is no harmonic structure in the helical wiggler itself and the higher velocity harmonics vanish for the exact steady - state orbits of the on - axis electrons .",
