    "the stationary allen - cahn equation is formally the @xmath13 euler - lagrange equation associated to the functional @xmath14 defined on each bounded domain @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "a complete description of the set of entire solutions of ( [ elliptic system ] ) , even in the scalar case @xmath17 in spite of many interesting and deep results ( see for example @xcite @xcite @xcite and the references therein ) , appears to be an impossible task . in this paper",
    "we are mostly interested in the vector case @xmath18 .",
    "we focus on _ symmetric _ potentials and proceed to a systematic discussions of symmetric solutions that can be determined by minimization of the energy ( [ functional ] ) .",
    "the restriction to the symmetric setting has both physical and mathematical motivations . from the physical point of view",
    "we observe that symmetry is ubiquitous in nature and that the modeling of systems ( e.g. materials ) that can exist in different symmetric crystalline phases requires the use of vector _ order parameters _",
    "symmetric structures are observed at the junction of three or four coexisting phases in physical space .",
    "similar structures appear at the singularities of soap films and compounds of soap bubbles .    from the mathematical point of view , as we discuss in sec.2 , symmetry plays an essential role in the derivation of pointwise estimate for solutions of ( [ elliptic system ] ) .",
    "indeed by exploiting the symmetry we show , as in @xcite and @xcite , the existence of minimizers of @xmath19 that map _ fundamental domains _ in the domain @xmath20-space into _ fundamental domains _ in the target @xmath21-space .",
    "a basic consequence of this is the existence of minimizers that in certain sub - domains avoid all the minima of @xmath22 but one .",
    "it follows that in each such sub - domain the potential @xmath22 can be considered to have a unique global minimum .",
    "this is a key point since , for potentials with two or more global minima , it is very difficult to determine _ a priori _ in which subregions a minimizer @xmath21 of @xmath19 is near to one or another of the minima of @xmath22 . even in the scalar case , @xmath17 , for a potential with two minima this",
    "has proved to be a very difficult question .",
    "for instance , this is one of the main difficulties in the problem of characterizing the level sets of solutions @xmath23 of the equation @xmath24 that satisfy the bound @xmath25 and the conditions @xmath26 a problem related to a celebrated conjecture of de giorgi @xcite .",
    "the study of equation ( [ elliptic system ] ) under symmetry hypotheses on the potential @xmath22 was initiated in @xcite and @xcite where the existence of a solution @xmath27 of ( [ elliptic system ] ) with the symmetry of the equilateral triangle was established .",
    "existence of solutions with the symmetry of the regular tetrahedron was later proved in @xcite for @xmath28 .",
    "these solutions are known as the triple and the quadruple _ junction _ states , respectively and , as indicated before with reference to soap films , are related to minimal surface complexes and in particular to the local structure of singularities where three sheets meet along a line or where four of these lines meet at a point @xcite .",
    "existence of solutions @xmath8 equivariant with respect to a generic finite reflection group @xmath6 acting both on the domain and on the target space was studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we introduce an abstract notion of equivariance of maps that includes as a special case the notion considered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume there is a finite or discrete ( infinite ) reflection group @xmath6 acting on @xmath29 and a finite reflection group @xmath7 acting on @xmath30 and assume there exists a homomorphism @xmath31 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for the concept of fundamental domain and for the general theory of reflection groups we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we define a map @xmath8 to be @xmath32-equivariant if @xmath33 we characterize the homomorphisms which allow for the existence of @xmath32-equivariant maps that map a fundamental domain @xmath34 for the action of @xmath6 on @xmath29 into a fundamental domain @xmath35 for the action of @xmath7 on @xmath30 : @xmath36 we refer to these homomorphism and to the maps that satisfy ( [ positivity ] ) as _ positive_. positive homomorphisms ( see definition [ positive homomorphism ] below ) have certain mapping properties that relate the projections associated to the walls of a fundamental domain @xmath34 to the projections associated to the walls of a correponding region @xmath35 .",
    "these properties are instrumental to show that minimizing in the class of @xmath32-equivariant maps that satisfy ( [ positivity ] ) does not affect the euler - lagrange equation and renders a smooth solution of ( [ elliptic system ] ) .",
    "the proof of this fact is based on a quite sophisticated use of the maximum principle for parabolic equations that was first introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we prove ( see lemma [ positivity flow ] ) that , provided @xmath32 is a positive homomorphism , the @xmath13 gradient flow associated to the functional preserves the positivity condition . by a careful choice of certain scalar projections of the vector parabolic equation that describes the above mentioned gradient flow , we show that this fact is indeed a consequence of the maximum principle .",
    "based on this and on a pointwise estimate from @xcite and @xcite we prove two abstract existence results : theorem [ theorem1 ] which concerns the case where @xmath6 is a finite reflection group and theorem [ theorem2 ] that treats the case of a discrete ( infinite ) group @xmath6 .    from ( [ positivity ] ) and the @xmath32-equivariance of @xmath21 it follows @xmath37 therefore , besides its importance for the proofs of theorem [ theorem1 ] and theorem [ theorem2 ] ,",
    "the mapping property ( [ positivity ] ) is a source of information on the geometric structure of the vector valued map @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that ( [ positivity-1 ] ) holds true in general in the abstract setting of the present analysis can perhaps be regarded as a major result of our work . indeed due to the variety of choices for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the dimensions of domain and target space , of the possible choices of the reflection groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and of the homomorphism @xmath31",
    ", we will deduce from theorem [ theorem1 ] and theorem [ theorem2 ] the existence of various complex multi - phase solutions of ( [ elliptic system ] ) including several types of lattice solutions .",
    "a characterization of all homomorphisms between reflection groups in general dimensions is not known .",
    "for the special case @xmath40 , in the appendix , we determine all positive homomorphisms between finite reflection groups and the corresponding solutions of .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we discuss the notion of @xmath32-equivariance , the concept of _ positive _ homomorphism @xmath31 and give a few examples . in sec.3",
    "we list the hypotheses on the potential @xmath22 and state the main results , theorem [ theorem1 ] and theorem [ theorem2 ] , that we prove in sec.4 .",
    "in sec.5 and in sec.6 we apply the abstract theorems proved in sec.4 to specific situations and present a series of solutions of ( [ elliptic system ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the standard inner product of @xmath42 , by @xmath43 the norm of @xmath44 and by @xmath45 the distance of @xmath20 from @xmath46 .",
    "here and in the following section , together with the abstract concepts and general proofs , we present simple but significant examples and special cases to help the reader to build a deep understanding of the paper . we begin with some examples of @xmath32-equivariant maps .",
    "we let @xmath47 the identity map of @xmath48 . as a first example we observe that , in the particular case where @xmath49 and the homomorphism @xmath32 is the identity , @xmath32-equivariance reduces to the notion considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite : @xmath50 the next example is a genuine @xmath32-equivariant map . in @xcite ,",
    "under the assumption that @xmath22 is invariant under the group @xmath7 of the equilateral triangle , we constructed a solution @xmath51 to system such that    * @xmath52 for all @xmath53 ( which is the dihedral group @xmath54 ) .",
    "* @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "if we incorporate the additional symmetry @xmath57 in a group structure , this solution can be seen as an @xmath32-equivariant map .",
    "indeed , the regular hexagon reflection group @xmath58 contains @xmath59 , and the antipodal map @xmath60 given by @xmath61 . since @xmath62 commutes with the elements of @xmath54 , @xmath6 is isomorphic to the group product @xmath63 .",
    "furthemore , we can define a homomorphism @xmath64 , by setting @xmath65 and @xmath66 , for every @xmath67 .",
    "then , the above conditions @xmath68 and @xmath57 express the @xmath32-equivariance of the solution @xmath21 in @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can consider the action on @xmath69 of the discrete reflection group @xmath70 generated by the reflections @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 with respect to the correponding lines @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( the dashed lines in figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "these three lines bound a triangle @xmath77 with angles 30 , 60 and 90 degrees , which is a fundamental domain of @xmath70 .",
    "the discrete group @xmath70 contains also all the reflections with respect to the lines drawn in figure [ figure1 ] , which partition the plane into triangles congruent to @xmath77 .     on the left and the finite reflection group @xmath59 on the right . ]",
    "the point group of @xmath70 , that is the stabilizer of the origin : @xmath78 , is the group @xmath58 , and we have @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the translation group of @xmath70 .",

    "now , if we compose the canonical homomomorphism @xmath83 such that @xmath84 for every @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with the homomorphism @xmath87 defined in the previous paragraph , we obtain a homomorphism @xmath88 .",
    "we have in particular @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the reflection in the line @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the image of the line @xmath92 by an @xmath93-equivariant map @xmath94 is contained in the line @xmath95 while the images of the lines @xmath96 and @xmath97 are contained in the line @xmath98 .",
    "indeed @xmath99 the lines @xmath100 and @xmath101 define a 60 degree sector @xmath35 which is a fundamental domain of the finite reflection group @xmath54 .",
    "at a later stage , we will prove the existence of a solution to that maps the triangle @xmath77 in this sector .",
    "now we return to the general setting and discuss the notion of positive homomorphism @xmath102 between reflection groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 . before giving the definition",
    "we observe that if @xmath103 is a reflection we have @xmath104 .",
