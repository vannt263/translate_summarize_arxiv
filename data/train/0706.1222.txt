    "the study of exotic nuclei through knockout reactions has provided important results along the last decades . among those ,",
    "one proton removal reactions have been proven as a useful tool for the understanding of light , proton rich , exotic nuclei . from the reaction point of view",
    ", the inclusion of a long - range part in the interaction between the proton and the target , i.e. the coulomb field , provides a significant complication with respect to the neutron case as well as a challenge for reaction theory .",
    "this work is an extension of the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , a formalism to treat neutron breakup to all orders , including the whole multipole expansion of the coulomb interaction giving the recoil of the core , was presented . here",
    "that theoretical framework is completed in order to account for proton breakup as well . for proton halo nuclei coulomb breakup reactions in the laboratory",
    "have been used to get indirect information on the radiative capture , since it has been shown that the coulomb breakup cross section is proportional to the radiative capture cross section @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental papers @xcite-@xcite have reported experiments on proton breakup from @xmath0b .",
    "@xmath1b is partner in ( p,@xmath2 ) radiative capture reactions of great astrophysical interest for the understanding of the neutrino flux from the sun ( see for example the discussion and references of @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath3f is another candidate for proton halo which is still under investigation both experimentally @xcite as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "furthermore @xmath3f plays an important role in understanding explosive nucleo - synthesis in x - ray bursts and novae , as it enters in the sequence @xmath4o(@xmath5,p)@xmath3f(p,@xmath2)@xmath6ne(@xmath5,p)@xmath7na , where cross sections are poorly known .",
    "the existence of a proton halo has sometimes been questioned @xcite and results from different experiments might seem to be contradictory @xcite .",
    "some of the apparent discrepancies in experimental results and their analysis have been recently discussed and in large part solved in ref .",
    "this work is the extension to the proton breakup problem of the formalism developed in @xcite for neutron breakup .",
    "similar formulae to those of the neutron breakup can be derived , since the coulomb potential can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass ratios of proton and core , respectively , to that of the projectile . the coordinate system used in this paper",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ pall ] . following a procedure analogous to that of @xcite , where @xmath14 was defined as @xmath15 , the coulomb phase for the proton",
    "is shown to be @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the neutron initial bound state energy while @xmath19 is the final neutron - core continuum energy . since @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ fasipr ] ) can be written as @xmath21 leading to @xmath22    the coulomb phase eq.([pff ] ) is therefore the sum of two terms : one of them describes the recoil of the core whereas the other accounts for the direct proton - target coulomb interaction .",
    "of course , in the case of the neutron the latter vanishes and the phase reduces to the one derived in @xcite .",
    "the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ fiqui ] ) to first order in @xmath23 yields the dipole approximation to the phase : @xmath24 which only differs from the neutron breakup case in the different constant factor , which is now @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our expression for the differential cross - section is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the core - target elastic scattering probability discussed later .",
    "such a form of the cross section has been introduced for relativistic energy electromagnetic excitations in ref.@xcite where however a first order perturbation theory amplitude was considered .",
    "it has been derived in an eikonal approach to the halo - projectile scattering @xcite and it has been widely used also for normal projectiles in the case of peripheral reactions such as transfer and inelastic excitations @xcite . under the conditions that the core - target interaction is mainly absorptive it has been re - obtained by bertulani in a relativistic approach to proton breakup @xcite .",
    "this paper has also shown that relativistic corrections to dynamical approaches such as the continuum discretised coupled channel method ( cdcc ) can increase the proton breakup cross section of as much as 15% at the incident energy of 250 a.mev .",
    "our formalism however follows closely ref.@xcite where relativistic kinematics is easily implemented and it has been used in the numerical calculations presented in this paper . as we shall see in the following our results agree indeed rather well with high energy experimental data .",
    "the probability amplitude in eq.([cross ] ) has been written as the sum of three pieces : the recoil term , @xmath29 where , according to the discussions in @xcite , the sudden limit has been used in order to include all orders in the interaction .",
    "similarly , the second term in our probability amplitude is the direct proton coulomb interaction .",
    "it has the same form as eq.([grec ] ) but for the substitution @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "finally , the nuclear part is @xmath33    a number of papers have addressed the problem of asymmetry in the core parallel momentum distribution after proton knockout @xcite .",
    "the fact that this asymmetry comes from high order terms can be directly extracted from our formalism . if the coulomb part of the amplitude @xmath34",
    "is simply expanded to first order in @xmath14 , it becomes @xmath35 which can be written , in terms of the one - dimensional fourier transform in @xmath36direction @xmath37 , as @xmath38 thus the coulomb breakup probability amplitude can be regarded as a coherent sum of three terms , each of which contains a shifted @xmath36fourier transform .",
    "the shifts are in opposite directions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but they are not visible in the calculated momentum distributions shown in this paper as @xmath41 depends on @xmath42 itself .",
    "the amount of deformation will also depend on the explicit form of the wave function @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath44 factor indicates that the asymmetry decreases as the beam energy increases .    in dipole approximation",
    ", however , the amplitude is just    @xmath45    which does not contain any asymmetry for the momentum distribution as it involves square moduli of @xmath46 separately .",
    "hence we can confirm analytically that the asymmetry in coulomb breakup parallel momentum distributions is due to the presence of higher multipole terms , in agreement with earlier works @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of the nuclear interaction introduces an interference that does depend on the sign of @xmath47 and thus an additional asymmetry to that due to higher multipole terms in the coulomb interaction .",
    "be fragments after proton - removal from @xmath0b against pb at 936 a.mev .",
    "the calculations are the sum of contributions leading to the ground and excited state of @xmath48be weighted by the respective spectroscopic factors and include both the diffraction and stripping parts of nuclear breakup , besides coulomb breakup .",

    "spectroscopic factors are not included.,width=264 ]    this formalism has been applied to proton breakup of @xmath0b against pb and c targets at a beam energy of 936 a.mev , experiment reported in @xcite .",
    "the projectile @xmath0b is taken as a two - body object .",
    "its ground state has components with a proton coupled to the ground @xmath49 state and to the excited e@xmath50kev @xmath51 state of @xmath48be .",
    "the proton separation energy is 137 kev when the @xmath48be is left in its ground state and @xmath52 kev when it is left in an excited state .",
    "radial wave functions have been obtained by numerical solution of the schrdinger equation in woods - saxon potentials with depths adjusted to reproduce the corresponding separation energies .",
    "the radius parameter of these woods - saxon potentials have been taken as 1.3 fm with a diffuseness of 0.6 fm .",
    "the nuclear breakup is described in this formalism through the proton - target and core - target s - matrices .",
    "these have been calculated by taking the optical limit in glauber theory @xcite .",
    "the effective two - body interactions are obtained by folding effective nucleon - nucleon interactions with the densities of the nuclei involved .",
    "pb density was approximated by a woods - saxon profile fitted to reproduce the experimental root mean square radius 5.5 fm @xcite . @xmath48be and",
    "@xmath53c densities were taken as gaussian with root mean square radius 2.31 and 2.35 fm respectively @xcite .",
    "the stripping contribution to nuclear breakup has been calculated in the eikonal formalism @xcite .    with these ingredients and the formulae described in the previous section , the single particle cross - sections of table [ t1 ] were calculated .",
    "interference between coulomb and elastic nuclear part are included automatically in the amplitude , but stripping must be added incoherently .",
    "when comparing to experimental data , spectroscopic factors must be taken into account . following @xcite , the spectroscopic factor for the excited state is @xmath54 in this work , while for the ground state we have used @xmath55 .",
    "the latter has been obtained by adding together the spectroscopic factors for two states which differ in core intrinsic spin @xcite , since our formalism can not distinguish between them .",
    "these numbers provide an exclusive / inclusive ratio of @xmath56 for the pb target , in good agreement with the experimental result @xmath57 .",
    "such agreement is also good for the c target , as the experimental result is @xmath58 , while we obtain @xmath59 . the inclusive momentum distribution on lead is shown in fig .",
    "[ ggg ] with no scale factors . in this calculation",
    "the stripping contribution is assumed to have the same shape as the diffractive one .",
    "clearly the agreement is not perfect , but in view of the very simple two - body forms of our initial and final wave functions which do not contain any three - body effects , it can be considered reasonable . regarding absolute cross - sections , in the case of the pb target ,",
    "our result for the excited state is 57.8 mb , in agreement with the exclusive measurement of @xmath60 mb , while the inclusive result @xmath61 mb is rightly described by our calculation of 652.4 mb ( table [ t1 ] ) . for the c target",
    "we predict 9.1 ( 92.6 ) mb for the exclusive ( inclusive ) measurement , consistent with the experimental result @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) mb .",
    "this formalism allows a direct check of the dipole approximation for the coulomb interaction , by comparing the results provided by the phase eq.([pff ] ) to those of eq.([dipp ] ) .",
    "[ gsi ] shows the calculated momentum distributions of protons in the projectile reference frame after breakup of @xmath0b .",
    "this does not include stripping .",
    "the dipole approximation , yields narrower momentum distribution and smaller single particle cross - section .",
    "high order effects , especially in the heavy target case , are not negligible , in agreement with @xcite , although in their calculation the effect appears smaller due to their choice of large impact parameters .",
    "we have also performed preliminary calculations for @xmath3f .",
    "they differ from those of ref.@xcite by about an order of magnitude for the g.s .",
    "breakup and by about a factor three for the breakup from @xmath3f@xmath64 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is in large part due to the use of a the plane wave as final state which neglects the coulomb proton - core interaction .",
    "an estimate of the possible correction can be obtained by calculating a barrier penetration factor @xmath65 at the core radius r@xmath66 according to ref.@xcite .    in table [ t2 ]",
    "we give the values of the penetration factors @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath0b and @xmath3f projectiles respectively .",
    "we give also the values of the corresponding sommerfeld parameters n@xmath69 and",
    "n@xmath70 , with n = z@xmath71z@xmath72e@xmath73 . these values show that for a peak in the proton - core energy spectrum around 1.5 - 2mev there is a possible error in the cross sections of 10 - 20% in the @xmath0b projectile case while the error is of 40 - 60% for @xmath3f .",
    "such estimates are independent from the initial binding energy and from the beam energy .",

    "in this paper we have introduced a semiclassical and analytical method to treat proton breakup to all orders and all multipoles in the coulomb potential . as previously done by some of us @xcite ,",
    "the present method is based on the use of a final nucleon wave function which is an extention of the traditional eikonal - type .",
    "if the coulomb potential is neglected , our breakup amplitude reduces to the well known eikonal form for the nuclear breakup . on the other hand",
    "if only the first order term of the coulomb phase is considered , our coulomb amplitude reduces to the multipole expansion in which the dipole term is treated by perturbation theory , while high order and higher multipole terms are treated in the sudden approximation according to @xcite . to test the method we have applied it to the study of one proton breakup from both the ground and first excited states of @xmath0b .",
    "our results are in very good agreement with experimental data at relativistic energies .",
    "preliminary calculations for @xmath3f at lower energies ( 65 a.mev ) have shown discrepancies of about one order of magnitude with respect to the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "we believe this is mainly due to our choice of a plane - wave for the final state wave - function .",
    "however , the use of the plane - wave has allowed analytical calculations leading to eq.([11 ] ) which is perhaps the most interesting result of this work .",
    "it shows explicitly the origin of a possible asymmetry in core parallel momentum distributions as contained in the fourier transform of the initial state wave function . in agreement with other numerical methods @xcite",
    "we have demonstrated that the asymmetry is due to the higher order multipole terms in the expansion of the coulomb potential , while it disappears in the dipole approximation .",
