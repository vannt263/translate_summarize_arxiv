    "a foundational result is that the poincar polynomial of @xmath31 is purely combinatorial ; in particular @xmath32 an arrangement @xmath33 is _ free _ if @xmath34 ; the @xmath35 are called the _ exponents _ of @xmath14 .",
    "terao s famous theorem @xcite is that if @xmath34 , then @xmath36 . if @xmath37 is central , then @xmath38 also defines a set of lines in @xmath39 , and obviously @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the complement of the corresponding arrangement of lines in @xmath18 .",
    "hence @xmath42 it follows from terao s theorem that if @xmath43 , then @xmath44 .",
    "this can be generalized @xcite to line arrangements which are not free , using the chern polynomial .",
    "the motivating question of this paper is : _ what happens if the arrangement of lines is replaced with a cl arrangement ? _      in @xcite , cogolludo - agustn studies the complement of an arrangement of rational curves in @xmath39 , where the individual curves can have singularities , and can meet non - transversally .",
    "the main result is that the cohomology ring of the complement to a rational curve arrangement is generated by logarithmic @xmath45 and @xmath46-forms and its structure depends on a finite number of invariants of the curve .",
    "one fact is that if @xmath41 is the complement of an arrangement of @xmath47 irreducible curves in @xmath39 , then @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of branches passing thru @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the normalization of @xmath20 .",

    "a crucial distinction between line and curve arrangements , even in our simple setting , is the difference between the milnor and tjurina numbers at a singularity .",
    "let @xmath55 be a reduced ( but not necessarily irreducible ) curve in @xmath56 , let @xmath57 , and let @xmath58 denote the ring of convergent power series .",

    "there are two other fundamental tools that can be used to prove that a line arrangement is free",
