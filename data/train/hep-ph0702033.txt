    "the possibility that the cosmic baryon asymmetry ( bau ) could originate from a lepton number asymmetry generated in the @xmath1 violating decays of the heavy seesaw majorana neutrinos was put forth twenty years ago by fukugita and yanagida  @xcite .",
    "their proposal came shortly after kuzmin , rubakov and shaposhnikov pointed out that above the electroweak phase transition @xmath2 is violated by fast electroweak anomalous interactions  @xcite .",
    "this implies that any lepton asymmetry would be in part converted into a baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , the discovery that at @xmath3gev electroweak interactions do not conserve baryon number , also suggested the exciting possibility that baryogenesis could be a purely standard model phenomenon , and opened the way to electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the early 90 s electroweak baryogenesis attracted more interest than leptogenesis . still , a few remarkable papers appeared that put the first basis for _ quantitative _ studies of leptogenesis",
    "i will just mention two important contributions : the 1992 luty s paper  @xcite in which the rates for several processes relevant for the boltzmann equations for leptogenesis were first presented , and the 1996 paper of covi , roulet and vissani  @xcite that computed the correct expression for the @xmath1 asymmetry in the decays of the lightest majorana neutrino .    around year 2000",
    "a flourishing of detailed studies of leptogenesis begins , with a corresponding burst in the number of papers dealing with this subject ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this raise of interest in leptogenesis can be traced back to two main reasons : firstly , by this time it became clear that within the standard model , electroweak baryogenesis fails to reproduce the correct bau by many orders of magnitude , and that even in supersymmetric models this scenario quite likely is not viable .",
    "secondly , the experimental confirmation ( from oscillation experiments ) that neutrinos have nonvanishing masses strengthened the case for the seesaw mechanism , that in turn implies the existence , at some large energy scale , of lepton number violating ( @xmath4 ) interactions .        the number of important papers and the list of people that contributed to the development of leptogenesis studies and to understand the various implications for the low energy neutrino parameters is too large to be recalled here .",
    "let me just mention the remarkable paper of giudice _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that appeared in 2003 : in this paper a whole set of thermal corrections for the relevant leptogenesis processes were carefully computed , a couple of mistakes common to previous studies were pointed out and corrected , and a detailed numerical analysis was presented both for the sm and the mssm cases .",
    "eventually , it was claimed that the residual numerical uncertainties would probably not exceed the 10%-20% level  @xcite .",
    "a couple of years later , nir , roulet , racker and myself  @xcite carried out a detailed study of additional effects that were not accounted for in the analysis of ref .",
    "this included electroweak and qcd sphaleron effects , the effects of the asymmetry in the higgs number density , as well as the constraints on the particles asymmetry - densities implied by the spectator reactions that are in thermal equilibrium in the different temperature ranges relevant for leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we found that the largest of theses new effects would barely reach the level of a few tens of percent .",
    "however , two important ingredients that had been overlooked in practically all previous leptogenesis studies , had still to be accounted for .",
    "these were the role of the light lepton flavors , and the role of the heavier seesaw majorana neutrinos .",
    "one remarkable exception was the 1999 paper of barbieri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that , besides addressing as the main topic the issue of flavor effects in leptogenesis , pointed out that the lepton number asymmetries generated in the decays of the heavier seesaw neutrinos should also be taken into account in computing the bau .",
    "however , these important results did not have much impact on subsequent analyses .",
    "the reason might be that these were thought to be just order one effects on the final value of the bau , with no other major consequences for leptogenesis . as i will discuss in the following",
    ", the size of the effects could easily reach the level of one order of magnitude , and , most importantly , they can spoil the leptogenesis constraints on the neutrino low energy parameters , and in particular the limit on the absolute scale of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "this is important , since it was thought that this limit was a firm prediction of leptogenesis with hierarchical seesaw neutrinos , and that the discovery of a neutrino mass @xmath5ev would have strongly disfavored leptogenesis , or hinted to different scenarios ( as e.g. resonant leptogenesis  @xcite ) .",
    "let us start by writing the first few terms of the leptogenesis lagrangian : @xmath6 -(\\lambda_{1}\\ , \\bar n_1\\ ,   \\ell_{1}{h } + { \\rm h.c.}).\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino with mass @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the higgs field , and @xmath10 is the lepton doublet to which @xmath7 couples , that when expressed on a complete orthogonal basis @xmath11 reads @xmath12 in practice it is always convenient to use the basis that diagonalizes the charged lepton yukawa couplings ( the flavor basis ) that also has well defined @xmath1 conjugation properties @xmath13 with @xmath14 . note that in the first and third term in ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) a lepton number can be assigned to @xmath7 , that is however violated by two units by the mass term . then eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian1 ] ) implies processes that violate @xmath15 like inverse - decays followed by @xmath7 decays @xmath16 or of - shell @xmath17 scatterings . at large temperatures @xmath18",
    ", @xmath7 decays and inverse decays are blocked because of thermal effects violating higgs decays can kinematically occur when @xmath19",
    "@xcite however , because of a large time dilation factor , only a small fraction of the higgses can actually decay before thermal phase space closes . ] and off - shell @xmath20 processes are suppressed with respect to @xmath15-conserving ones as @xmath21 . at @xmath22 decays and inverse decays are boltzmann suppressed , while @xmath23 scatterings are suppressed as @xmath24 . therefore the temperature range in which @xmath25 processes can be important for leptogenesis is around @xmath26 .",
    "the possibility of generating an asymmetry between the number of leptons @xmath27 and antileptons @xmath28 is due to a non - vanishing @xmath1 asymmetry in @xmath7 decays : @xmath29 in order that a macroscopic @xmath15 asymmetry can build up , the condition that @xmath25 reactions are ( at least slightly ) out of equilibrium at @xmath26 must also be satisfied .",
    "this condition can be expressed in terms of two dimensionful parameters , defined in terms of the higgs vev @xmath30 and of the plank mass @xmath31 as : @xmath32 the first parameter ( @xmath33 ) is related to the rates of @xmath7 processes ( like decays and inverse decays ) while the second one ( @xmath34 ) is related to the expansion rate of the universe at @xmath26 . when @xmath35 @xmath25 processes are slower than the expansion and leptogenesis can occur .",
    "as @xmath33 increases to values larger than @xmath34 , @xmath25 reactions approach thermal equilibrium thus rendering leptogenesis inefficient because of the back - reactions that tend to erase any macroscopic asymmetry .",
    "however , even for @xmath33 as large as @xmath36 a lepton asymmetry sufficient to explain the bau can be generated .",
    "it is customary to refer to the condition @xmath37 as to the _ strong washout regime _ since washout reactions are rather fast .",
    "this regime is considered more likely than the _ weak washout regime _",
    "@xmath35 in view of the experimental values of the light neutrino mass - squared differences ( that are both @xmath38 ) together with the theoretical lower bound @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mass of the lightest neutrino .",
    "the strong washout regime is also theoretically more appealing since the final value of the lepton asymmetry is independent of the particular value of the @xmath7 initial abundance and also of a possible asymmetry @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the entropy density ) preexisting the @xmath7 decay era .",
    "this last fact has been often used to argue that for @xmath37 only the dynamics of the lightest majorana neutrino @xmath7 is important , since asymmetries generated in the decays of the heavier @xmath0 would be efficiently erased by the strong @xmath7-related washouts . as we will see below , the effects of @xmath7 interactions on the @xmath43 asymmetries are subtle , and the previous argument is incorrect .",
    "the result of numerical integration of the boltzmann equations for @xmath44 can be conveniently expressed in terms of an efficiency factor @xmath45 , that ranges between 0 and 1 : @xmath46 the second relation gives a rough approximation for @xmath45 in the strong washout regime that will become useful in analyzing the impact of flavor effects .",
    "the possibility of deriving an upper limit for the the light neutrino masses  @xcite follows from the existence of a theoretical bound on the maximum value of the @xmath1 asymmetry @xmath47 ( that holds when @xmath48 are sufficiently hierarchical ) and relates @xmath8 , @xmath49 and the washout parameter @xmath33 : @xmath50    \\,\\sqrt{1-\\frac{m_{\\nu_1}^2}{\\tilde m_1 ^ 2}}.\\ ] ] the term in square brackets is the so called davidson - ibarra limit @xcite while the square root is a correction that was first given in @xcite . when @xmath51ev , the light neutrinos are quasi - degenerate and @xmath52 so that , to keep @xmath47 finite , @xmath8 is pushed to large values @xmath53gev . since at the same time @xmath33 must remain larger than @xmath54 the washout effects also increase , until the surviving lepton - asymmetry is too small to explain the bau .",
    "washout processes , that depend on a different parameter than @xmath33 , and that can become important when @xmath8 is large , also play a role in establishing the limit . ]",
    "the interesting limit @xmath55ev results .",
    "in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) the terms involving the charged lepton yukawa couplings have not been included .",
    "since all these couplings are rather small , if leptogenesis occurs at temperatures @xmath56gev , when the universe is still very young , not many of the related ( slow ) processes could have occurred during its short lifetime , and leptogenesis has essentially no knowledge of lepton flavors . at @xmath57gev the reactions mediated by the tau yukawa coupling @xmath58 become important , and at @xmath59gev also @xmath60-reactions have to be accounted for . including the yukawa terms for the leptons",
    "yields the lagrangian : @xmath61 -(\\lambda_{1i}\\ , \\bar n_1\\ ,   \\ell_{i}{h } + h_i\\bar e_i\\ell_i h^\\dagger +   { \\rm h.c.}),\\ ] ] where , since we are using the flavor basis , the matrix @xmath62 of the yukawa couplings is diagonal .",
    "the flavor content of the ( anti)lepton doublets @xmath10 ( @xmath63 ) to which @xmath7 decays is now important , since these states do not remain coherent , but are effectively resolved into their flavor components by the fast yukawa interactions @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "note that in general , due to @xmath1 violating loop effects , @xmath65 , that is the antileptons produced in @xmath7 decays are not the @xmath1 conjugated of the leptons , implying that the flavor projections @xmath66 differ : @xmath67 .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 and @xmath63 can differ in their flavor content implies that even when @xmath7 decays with equal branchings into leptons and antileptons ( yielding @xmath68 ) the @xmath1 asymmetries for the decays into single flavors can still be non - vanishing .",
    "the flavor @xmath1 asymmetries are defined as  @xcite : @xmath69 the factor @xmath70 in the second equality accounts for the flavor mismatch between leptons and antileptons , while the factor @xmath71 in front of @xmath47 accounts for the reduction in the strength of the @xmath7-@xmath72 coupling with respect to @xmath7-@xmath10 .",
    "the same factor also reduces the strength of the washouts for the @xmath73-flavor , yielding an efficiency factor @xmath74 . assuming for illustration @xmath75 the resulting asymmetry is @xmath76 in the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "@xmath77 represents the number of flavors effectively resolved by the charged lepton yukawa interactions ( @xmath78 or 3 ) , while @xmath44 is the asymmetry that would have been obtained by neglecting the decoherence of @xmath10 .",
    "the second term , that is controlled by the flavor mismatch factor @xmath70 , can become particularly large in the cases when the flavor @xmath73 is almost decoupled from @xmath7 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .  2 for the two - flavor case and for two different temperature regimes .",
    "the two flat curves give @xmath80 as a function of the flavor projector @xmath81 assuming @xmath82 , and show rather clearly the enhancement of a factor @xmath83 with respect to the aligned cases ( the points at @xmath84 ) for which flavor effects are irrelevant .",
    "the other two curves , that peak at values close to the boundaries , when @xmath85 or a combination orthogonal to @xmath85 are almost decoupled from @xmath7 , show that @xmath10-@xmath86 flavor mismatch can produce much larger enhancements . in conclusion ,",
    "the relevance of flavor effects is at least twofold :     ( in units of @xmath87 ) as a function of @xmath88 in two two - flavor regimes .",
    "the thick lines correspond to the special case when @xmath89 .",
    "the thin lines give an example of the results for @xmath90 .",
    "the filled circles and squares at @xmath91 correspond to the aligned cases without flavor effects . ]    * the bau resulting form leptogenesis can be several times larger than what would be obtained neglecting flavor effects . *",
    "if leptogenesis occurs at temperatures when flavor effects are important , the limit on the light neutrino masses does not hold @xcite .",
    "this is because there is no analogous of the davidson - ibarra bound eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) for the flavor asymmetries @xmath92 .",
    "what about the possible effects of the heavier majorana neutrinos @xmath0 that we have so far neglected ?",
    "some recent studies analyzed the so called `` @xmath7-decoupling '' scenario , in which the yukawa couplings of @xmath7 are simply too weak to washout an asymmetry generated in @xmath93 decays ( and @xmath47 is too small to explain the bau )  @xcite .",
    "this is a consistent scenario in which @xmath93 leptogenesis could successfully explain the bau .",
    "however , in the opposite situation when the yukawa couplings of @xmath7 are very large , it was generally assumed that the asymmetries related to @xmath0 are irrelevant for the computation of the bau , since they would be washed out during @xmath7 leptogenesis .",
    "in contrast to this , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and more recently also in ref .",
    "@xcite ) it was stated that part of the asymmetry from @xmath0 decays does in general survive , and must be taken into account when computing the bau . in ref .",
    "@xcite engelhard , grossman , nir and myself carried out a detailed study of the fate of a lepton asymmetry preexisting @xmath7 leptogenesis , and we reached conclusions that agree with these statements .",
    "i will briefly describe the reasons for this and the importance of the results . including",
    "also @xmath0 the leptogenesis lagrangian reads : @xmath94 -(\\lambda_{\\alpha i}\\ , \\bar n_\\alpha\\ ,   \\ell_{i}{h } + h_i\\bar e_i\\ell_i h^\\dagger +   { \\rm h.c.}),\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is a heavy neutrinos index , and the heavy neutrinos are written in the mass basis .",
    "it is convenient to define the three ( in general non - orthogonal ) combinations of lepton doublets @xmath96 to which the corresponding @xmath97 decay : @xmath98 let us discuss for definiteness the case where a sizeable asymmetry originates from @xmath93 decays , while @xmath7 leptogenesis is instead rather inefficient .",
    "that is , let us assume that @xmath93-related washouts are not too strong , while @xmath7-related washouts are so strong that by itself @xmath7 leptogensis would not be successful : @xmath99 to simplify the arguments , let us also impose two additional conditions : thermal leptogenesis , that is a vanishing initial @xmath7 abundance @xmath100 , and a strong hierarchy @xmath101 . from this",
    "it follows that there are no @xmath7 related washout effects during @xmath93 leptogenesis and , because @xmath102 is boltzmann suppressed , there are no @xmath93 related washouts during @xmath7 leptogenesis .",
    "thus @xmath93 and @xmath7 dynamics are decoupled .",
    "now , the second condition in ( [ conditions ] ) implies that already at @xmath103 the interactions mediated by the @xmath7 yukawa couplings are sufficiently fast to quickly destroy the coherence of the state @xmath104 produced in @xmath93 decays .",
    "then a statistical mixture of @xmath10 and of the states orthogonal to @xmath10 builds up , and it can be described by a suitable _ diagonal _ density matrix . on general grounds",
    "one expects that decoherence effects proceed faster than washout .",
    "in the relevant range , @xmath103 , this is also ensured by the fact that because of thermal effects the dominant @xmath105 washout process ( the inverse decay @xmath106 ) is blocked @xcite , and only scatterings with top - quarks and gauge bosons , that have additional suppression factors of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , contribute to the washout .",
    "let us consider the case where both @xmath109 and @xmath7 decay at @xmath110gev and flavor effects are irrelevant . in this regime",
    "a convenient choice for the orthogonal lepton basis is @xmath111 where , without loss of generality , @xmath112 can be chosen to satisfy @xmath113 .",
    "then the asymmetry @xmath114 produced in @xmath93 decays decomposes in the two components : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the crucial point here is that in general we expect @xmath118 , and since @xmath119 is orthogonal to @xmath10 , @xmath120 is protected against @xmath7 washouts .",
    "then a finite part of the asymmetry @xmath114 from @xmath93 decays survives through @xmath7 leptogenesis .",
    "a more detailed study  @xcite reveals also some unexpected features .",
    "for example , @xmath44 is not driven to zero in spite of the strong @xmath7-related washouts , rather , only the sum of @xmath44 and of the higgs asymmetry @xmath121 vanishes , but not the two separately .",
    "( this can be traced back to the presence of a conserved charge related to @xmath120 . ) as a result we obtain @xmath122 and @xmath123 , while the total lepton asymmetry is @xmath124 .    for @xmath125gev the @xmath126 flavor structures are only partially resolved during @xmath7 leptogenesis , and a similar result is obtained . however , when @xmath127gev and the full flavor basis @xmath128 is resolved , there are no directions in flavor space where an asymmetry can remain protected , and then the whole @xmath114 can be erased . in conclusion ,",
    "the common assumption that when @xmath7 leptogenesis occurs in the strong washout regime the final bau is independent of initial conditions , does not hold in general , and is justified only in the following cases  @xcite : _ i ) _  vanishing decay asymmetries and/or efficiency factors for @xmath0 ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) ; _ ii )",
    "_  @xmath7-related washouts are still significant at @xmath131gev ; _ iii )",
    "_  reheating occurs at a temperature in between @xmath132 and @xmath8 . in all other cases the @xmath0-related parameters",
    "can not be ignored when calculating the bau , and any constraint inferred from analyses based only on @xmath7 leptogenesis are not reliable .",
