    "the local bubble ( lb ) is a cavity , elongated towards the galactic north pole , with an average extension of about 100 pc , copiously radiating in soft x - rays .",
    "there exist a number of discrepancies between observations and modelling that have all been outlined in a recent panel discussion ( breitschwerdt & cox 2004 ) .",
    "most models proceed from a multi - supernova origin of the lb ( cf.berghfer & breitschwerdt 2002 for possible supernova ( sn ) progenitors ) , in which the lb is the result of successive sn explosions , although part of the soft x - ray emission could be of heliospheric origin , generated by charge exchange reactions between solar wind ions and heliospheric plasma .",
    "we use a 3d godunov type parallelized amr hydrocode to track small scale structures down to 1.25 pc , where necessary ( for details see avillez 2000 ) . according to berghfer & breitschwerdt ( 2002 ) 20 stars of pleiades subgroup b1 with masses between 10 and 20 @xmath0 were moving through the lb within the last 14 myr , exploding after their main sequence life time , @xmath1 , along a path crossing @xmath2 , @xmath3 pc ( see fig .  1 ) , thus generating the local cavity into which the lb expands .",
    "the galactic sn rate has been used for the setup of _ other sne _ in the background disk .",
    "first we derive analytic similarity solutions , taking an initial mass function for galactic ob associations with powerlaw index @xmath5 , and using @xmath6)^{-\\alpha}$ ] yr ( stothers 1972 ) , with @xmath7 , for stars within the mass range @xmath8 .",
    "the mechanical energy input rate ( see berghfer & breitschwerdt 2002 ) then is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 yr . modifying suitably the similarity solutions of mccray & kafatos ( 1987 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "note , that our value of @xmath15 is between the canonical value of @xmath16 for a sedov - type solution and @xmath17 for a wind type solution , due to the declining energy input rate with time .",
    "if we now try to match a present day average radius of the lb of even 146 pc at time @xmath18 myr , we need a constant ambient density of @xmath19 , a value way above the average ism density .",
    "comparison with our excellently matching numerical results shows , however , that this discrepancy must be due to mass loading , and turbulence in a sn disturbed _ background _ medium .",
