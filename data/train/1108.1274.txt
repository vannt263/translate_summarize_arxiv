    "mapping of qcd phase diagram at finite temperature and density@xcite is one of the most challenging issues in the theoretical and experimental physics and is significant to the heavy - ion collision experiments and the structures of the neutron stars .    at finite temperature and zero or small baryon density ,",
    "a number of investigations on the qcd phase transition are made both with the lattice qcd simulations@xcite and with the model calculations@xcite .",
    "lattice qcd simulations suggest that the phase transition becomes smooth crossover in the realistic case with two light and one heavier quark flavors , and many model calculations are consistent with this result . at finite density , however , the situation is uncertain because lattice qcd simulations are still challenging at finite chemical potentials with low temperatures@xcite . in such a region , it is important to employ models for qualitative and quantitative calculations on the phase diagram . naively , a large baryon number density may cause overlaps of baryons , which invalidates a concept of confined colors in a baryon , resulting in deconfinement , which may be followed by chiral phase transition .",
    "furthermore , at asymptotically large density , the appearance of a color - superconducting ( csc ) phase is also expected , where a weak coupling theory is applied and the cooper instabiltiy of the ferimi sphere is inevitable@xcite .",
    "the color superconducting phases are characterized by the diquark condensates .",
    "one - gluon exchange interactions tell us that the color - antitriplet channel is attractive . therefore , with the pauli principle , condensates in the color- and flavor - antitriplet and spin antisymmetric channel is expected .",
    "such condensates can be expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the quark field , and @xmath2 with @xmath3 the charge conjugation operator .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are the antisymmetric generators of su(@xmath8 ) flavor and su(@xmath9 ) color groups , respectively .",
    "one of the most striking features in the csc phases is the formation of the color - flavor locking ( cfl ) condensate . at sufficiently high density ,",
    "the finite current quark masses for up , down and strange quark flavor are neglected so that the system can be treated as the chiral limit . in the cfl phase ,",
    "which is characterized by @xmath10 with nonzero @xmath11 , su(3)@xmath12 su(3)@xmath13 su(3)@xmath14 symmetry of the system breaks down to its subgroup of su(3)@xmath15 .",
    "this breaking pattern is possible owing to the miraculous matching of the ( effective ) number of flavors @xmath16 and the number of colors @xmath17 .    to investigate the qcd phase diagram at finite temperature and chemical potential , chiral random matrix ( chrm ) models provide us of a qualitative way from a viewpoint of the symmetry@xcite . in a conventional chrm model ,",
    "the dirac operator is set as a random matrix , which has the same symmetry with qcd , and the partition function is defined as the average of the determinant of the dirac operator over the matrix elements with the gaussian distribution .",
    "the random distribution of the matrix elements mimics the complex dynamics of the gluon fields .",
    "the gaussian model can be solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although the model is constructed in such a simple way , the resulting phase diagram has a rich structure . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the phase transition becomes second - order in the small chemical potential @xmath18 region , while it becomes first - order in the large @xmath18 region .",
    "first- and second - order phase transition lines are connected at the tricritical point ( tcp ) .",
    "this result is consistent with njl models@xcite .",
    "the extension of the chrm model to the case with the csc phase has already been studied by vanderheyden and jackson @xcite using chrm models@xcite . ] . in their study , the dirac matrix is extended to have the indices of color and spin explicitly with the real random matrices corresponding to real gluon fields in qcd . after the integration over the random matrices , the model produces the quark - quark interaction terms , which are responsible for the diquark condensates , as well as quark - antiquark interaction terms responsible for the chiral condensates .",
    "the resulting phase diagram has the diquark condensed phase at large @xmath18 region , while the chirally - broken phase at small @xmath18 region , if the ratio of the quark - antiquark and the quark - quark coupling is taken so that the dirac operator of the model has the same symmetry with that of qcd .",
    "note that because the model in ref .",
    "@xcite contains two quark flavors , the csc phase is the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase , where only two of three colors of fermions participate in the diquark pairing .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether it is possible to extend the chrm model to the case with three flavors , and whether the cfl phase can appear as the ground state in a high density region .",
    "we answer `` yes '' to this question by constructing the chrm model containing three flavors and colors , and show a phase diagram with the chirally - broken and the cfl phase . as a simple application of this model",
    ", we also focus on the response of the model by changing the quark masses . by setting the strange quark mass different from the other two quark flavors , we observe that the 2sc phase appears on the phase diagram at the moderate values of the chemical potential , as well as the cfl phase in the larger chemical potential region .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce an extended chrm model with chiral and cfl condensations in sec .  2 , and derive its effective potential in sec .",
    "the model phase diagrams are presented and discussed in the case with three equal - mass flavors and 2 + 1 flavors in sec .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "6 is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we introduce a chiral random matrix model which mimics qcd partition function with three quark flavors , extending the two - flavor case in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we denote three quark masses by @xmath19 with @xmath20u , d and s.    keeping in mind the ( extended ) banks - casher relations , which relate dirac soft modes not only with the chiral condensates@xcite , but also with the diquark condensates@xcite , we consider the truncated dirac matrix @xmath21 in low - lying quark excitation , or zero - mode space .",
    "we assume @xmath21 can be separated as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a random part , which represents the complex gluon dynamics , and @xmath3 the non - random , deterministic part , which is responsible for the matter effects .    for simplicity",
    ", we first set the matter effects turned off , i.e. @xmath24 , and focus on the random matrix @xmath23 . in this case , the truncated dirac matrix should have the symmetries of the dirac operator in the vacuum , the chiral symmetry , @xmath25 , and the anti - hermiticity , @xmath26 . within these restrictions ,",
    "the dirac matrix generally has nonzero matrix elements only in the off - diagonal blocks @xmath27 in the chiral representation , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a complex matrix generally to be an @xmath30 rectangular matrix . in this case , the dirac matrix has @xmath31 exact zero eigenvalues , which represents the index theorem with the background gauge field having the topological charge @xmath32 .",
    "exploiting this fact , we can introduce the effect of the axial anomaly in the chrm models @xcite . in this study , however , we always take @xmath29 to be square and the anomaly effect is neglected . see the discussion in sec .  6 . ] . in the conventional chrm models@xcite , @xmath29 is taken to be a general complex matrix whose elements are independently distributed according to the gaussian distribution .    to consider the diquark condensations , however , it is crucial to treat the color and spin indices explicitly . following the construction in ref .",
    "@xcite , we express @xmath29 as a direct product of the spin , color and zero - mode matrices , whose total dimension is @xmath33 , where 2 is the size of the spin space , @xmath9 the color space , and @xmath34 the zero - mode space .",
    "we adopt the form of @xmath29 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 the pauli matrix , @xmath38 is a generator of su(@xmath9 ) , and @xmath39 is a @xmath40 random matrix . since the random matrix @xmath39 corresponds to the gauge field in qcd , we choose @xmath41 to be a real matrix .",
    "the matter effects are introduced as the non - random external fields in the dirac operator .",
    "a simple way@xcite is to add a constant matrix @xmath3 to the random matrix ( [ e : diracop ] ) with @xmath42 where the @xmath33-dimensional matrix @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath18 are an effective temperature and quark chemical potential , respectively .",
    "@xmath46 denotes @xmath47 identity matrix in the spin space .",
    "a total dirac matrix , @xmath22 , also has chiral symmetry , @xmath48 , but not anti - hermiticity , @xmath49 if @xmath50 . two relative signs between @xmath45 and @xmath18 corresponds to the two lowest matsubara frequency , @xmath51 .",
    "the inclusion of two signs reproduces the invariance of the partition function under the charge conjugation transformation , @xmath52 .    using the dirac matrix @xmath21 ,",
    "the chrm model partition function is defined as @xmath53 \\prod_{f=1}^{n_f } \\det ( d+m_f ) e^{-2n \\sigma^2 \\sum_{a,\\nu , i , j } ( a_{ij}^{\\nu a})^2 } , \\label{e : pf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral is defined over real elements of random matrices @xmath39 with the gaussian weight .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 , which fixes variance of the gaussian distribution , gives a scale to the model .",
    "generally , @xmath54 may change for each @xmath55 and @xmath32 , but by ensuring the color and loerntz symmetry , their values should be equal .    before solving the model ,",
    "we make two remarks on the treatment of the chrm model comparing to that in ref .",
    "first , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors examine not only the form of the random dirac operator ( [ e : diracop ] ) , but also the case where the dirac operator breaks the symmetry which qcd lagrangian holds . in such general cases ,",
    "the random matrix @xmath23 is taken as @xmath56 where the chiral indices @xmath57 r , l , @xmath58 is a random matrix , and @xmath59 is the independent gamma matrix in four dimension , @xmath60 . a set of @xmath61 can be separated into the subsets forming a lorentz scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector , axial - vector , and tensor . in eq.([e : diracop ] ) and ( [ e : w ] ) , we have chosen @xmath58 to be nonzero only for the vector content of the gamma matrices . this is a natural choice because we consider that the random matrices model the gluon fields , which form a lorentz vector .",
    "indeed , nonzero components for the scalar , pseudo - scalar and tensor break the chiral symmetry explicitly , and that for the axial - vector does the antihermiticity .",
    "if such non qcd - like random matrices are allowed , one can vary the ratio of the coefficients of the quark - antiquark and the quark - quark interaction channels , which is denoted as @xmath62 in the next section .",
    "the evolution of the phase diagram with @xmath62 changed was completely investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case with two flavors . in our study , however , we only focus on the case in which the model has the same type of the interaction with qcd , because the condition fixes the topology of the phase diagram without ambiguity and we can solely concentrate on the response of the phase diagram by changing the quark masses .",
    "second , the scheme of the temperature dependence is different from that in ref .",
    "we use the matter effect matrix proportional to the identity in the flavor space , while , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sign of the temperature @xmath45 is antisymmetric in the space of two flavors . as a result of this difference , our model can not be reduced to the model in ref .",
    "@xcite in the two flavor limit .",
    "further discussion will be given by comparing the effective potentials in the later section .",
    "finally , note that the partition function ( [ e : pf ] ) has su(@xmath63)@xmath64su(@xmath8)@xmath12su(@xmath8)@xmath65 global symmetry , but not local gauge symmetry . to be exact ,",
    "it is then appropriate to call the diquark condensed phase a bec state , not a bcs state . in the remaining part of this paper",
    ", we use the word , `` diquark condensates '' to indicate such condensates , but discuss them comparing to the bcs states expected in qcd at finite density .",
    "in this section , we derive the effective potential of the chrm model defined in eq.([e : pf ] ) .",
    "the derivation is almost parallel to that in ref.@xcite .",
    "we present the derivation in three steps , and then make a few remarks .",
    "the first step is to integrate out the gaussian integral variables @xmath66 . for this purpose",
    ", we first express the determinant in the partition function ( [ e : pf ] ) in the form with the fermion integrals :    @xmath67[d \\psi ] \\exp \\left [ - \\sum_f \\bar \\psi^f ( d + m_f)\\psi^f \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\int [ d \\psi^\\dagger ] [ d \\psi ] \\exp   \\left [   - i   j^{ij}_{a\\nu } a^{a\\nu}_{ij } - \\sum_f \\bar \\psi^f ( c + m_f )",
    "\\psi^f   \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 grassmann vectors , and @xmath71 is a fermion bilinear .    applying the gussian integral formula up to the constant , @xmath72 , to the @xmath73 integral separately for each indices @xmath74 and @xmath32",
    ", we obtain analytically @xmath75 e^{-i j_{a\\nu}^{ij}a^{a\\nu}_{ij } } e^{-2n \\sigma^2 ( a^{a\\nu}_{ij})^2 } = \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{1}{8 n \\sigma^2 } ( j_{a\\nu}^{ij})^2\\right ] \\label{e : fourpoint } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summations over @xmath76 and @xmath32 should be understood on the right - hand side .      in this step ,",
    "we expand the square of the fermion bilinear @xmath77 and realign the four point vertices , by applying the fierz transformation formula .",
    "the square of @xmath78 is expanded as @xmath79 the first term represents the quark - antiquark interactions , and the other terms the quark - quark interactions .",
    "the former is responsible for the formation of the chiral condensates and the latter for the diquark condensates .    using fierz transformations ,",
    "these four - fermion terms are rearranged so that in each fermion bilinear terms , zero - mode indices @xmath80 and @xmath81 are contracted . at this point",
    ", we assume that the chiral condensates are formed only in the color - singlet , scalar channels , and that the diquark condensates are formed only in the spin - antisymmetric , flavor- and color - antitriplet , scalar channels . with these assumptions ,",
    "relevant interaction terms are drastically reduced and shown explicitly as @xmath82 for quark - antiquark channels and @xmath83 for quark - quark channels , with the same except l @xmath84 r , where the charge conjugation fields are defined as @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the dots denote the terms irrelevant to the formation of the condensates we focus .    neglecting the irrelevant terms ,",

    "the phase transition line between the chirally - broken phase and the cfl phase also shifts to the larger @xmath18 region .",
    "although the second - order cfl phase transition line moves to extend the cfl phase , the cfl phase shrinks in total .",
    "we next concentrate on the response of the model to the asymmetry between the light up and down ( ud ) quark flavors and the mid - light strange quark flavor . in order to see this effect",
    ", we set the quark masses as @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we assume that the flavor symmetry is not broken further spontaneously , and set the order parameters as @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "we also write @xmath171 for convenience . due to the asymmetry between the ud and strange quarks , the typical symmetry in the cfl phase su@xmath172",
    "is not realized .",
    "nevertheless , we call the phase with @xmath173 and @xmath174 the cfl phase . also , the phase with @xmath173 and @xmath175 is defined as the 2sc phase    under the parametrization , the effective potential becomes the function of the four order parameters as @xmath176 \\nonumber \\\\ & + { \\rm c.c . } , \\label{e:2sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and we set @xmath127 . for the general case with @xmath179 and @xmath180 , the determinant part under the logarithm",
    "becomes complicated . by setting @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183",
    ", we recover the effective potential in the three equal - mass limit ( [ e : cfl ] ) .",
    "another interesting limit is the 2sc phase , where @xmath184 , in which the effective potential is separated to the ud quark sector and the strange quark sector as @xmath185 where @xmath186 + { \\rm c.c } \\label{e : pot_ud}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath187 the effective potential for the strange quark flavor ( [ e : pot_s ] ) is equivalent to the one of the conventional chrm model without diquark condensates@xcite , whose phase structure is summarized in sec .",
    "the effective potential ( [ e : pot_ud ] ) can be compared to the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two light quark flavors are introduced and the strange quark degree of freedom is neglected .",
    "we first point out that the ratio of the coefficients of the quadratic terms of the order parameters , which can be read from ( [ e : pot_ud ] ) as @xmath188 since @xmath189 , is equal to that appearing in the model in ref .",
    "the reproduction of @xmath190 is important since the phase structure is sensitive to this ratio .",
    "interestingly , however , these two effective potentials are not completely equivalent , and match only if @xmath154 or @xmath139 .",
    "this is because we use the different temperature scheme , or the matter effect matrix ( [ e : mem ] ) , from that used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the scheme used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective temperature is introduced with opposite signs for two flavors . on the other hand , in the scheme we used here ,",
    "the temperature is introduced proportionally to the identity in the flavor space .",
    "the relation of these schemes is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that there is a unitary matrix in the flavor and the matsubara space , which is a subspace of the zero - mode space , to rotate the one scheme to the other .",
    "the fermion bilinears corresponding to the chiral condensates are invariant under the rotation , but the diquark condensates are not .",
    "this is the formal reason why we find that the two effective potentials are equivalent not only at @xmath154 , but also at @xmath191 .    by considering the microscopic theory ,",
    "a reason of the choice of the flavor - antisymmetric scheme can be explained as follows@xcite : to make the flavor - antisymmetric quark pair condensate be independent of the imaginary time @xmath192 , only the terms of two quark fields with the opposite signs of the matsubara frequencies should be nonzero in the fourier summation over the matsubara frequencies .",
    "this indicates that the temperature term , or the lowest matsubara frequencies , should have the opposite signs for different flavors , because , in the diquark pairing , two quarks have different flavors in our treatment .",
    "nevertheless , we use the flavor - symmetric scheme in this paper because of the following reasons .",
    "first , if we construct the chrm model relying only on the symmetry , we can not find a principle which scheme has to be adopted .",
    "both treatments are consistent with the qcd symmetry , the anti - hermiticity at @xmath152 , and the chiral symmetry for all @xmath45 and @xmath18 of the dirac operator .",
    "second , because we treat the chrm model in the case with three flavors , in order to adopt the flavor - antisymmetric scheme , we have to concern contributions from three combinations of the three flavors .",
    "this might make the effective potential more complicated , and we try to make the model as simple as possible .",
    "indeed , the resulting phase diagram , which will be shown below , is qualitatively equivalent to the model with the flavor - antisymmetric scheme at @xmath184 . in other words",
    ", they have the same global structure , or topology , of the phases .",
    "it suggests that the qualitative structure of the phase diagram is not sensitive to the selection of the temperature dependence schemes , as long as they hold the symmetry .     and @xmath193",
    "notations are the same with fig .  1 .",
    "in the narrow slit between the symmetric phase and the cfl phase , which can be seen in the right panel , only @xmath194 has a large value .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   and @xmath193 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we next present the resulting phase diagram .",
    "similar to the case with three equal - mass flavors , we need numerical calculations to evaluate the whole phase diagram .",
    "the result with @xmath141 and @xmath195 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f:2sc ] . at a small chemical potential",
    ", the diquark condensates do not have finite values in the ground state , and the phase diagram is the same with the model without the diquark condensates . because for the ud quark flavors , there are no symmetry - breaking mass terms , the second - order phase transition line , as well as the tcp , exist . on the contrary , for the strange quark flavor , finite @xmath196 breaks the chiral symmetry explicitly , and then the second - order phase transition line becomes crossover .",
    "the tcp also becomes a critical point . in the symmetric phase , @xmath197 and @xmath194",
    "become exactly zero , but @xmath198 never becomes zero due to the finite symmetry breaking term @xmath196 .    as @xmath18",
    "is increased with @xmath45 kept small , a first - order phase transition to the 2sc phase is first observed . in the 2sc phase ,",
    "not only @xmath11 , but also @xmath198 have large values . if @xmath18 is further increased , we next observe a phase transition to the cfl phase , where both @xmath11 and @xmath194 have large values . note that because the flavor symmetry is explicitly broken , generally @xmath199 in the cfl phase .",
    "the diquark condensates become zero continuously when @xmath45 and @xmath18 are increased . as seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f:2sc ] , there is a narrow slit between two second - order phase transition lines for @xmath11 and @xmath194 . in this area",
    ", only @xmath194 has a large value .",
    "four phase transition lines , two horizontal second - order phase transition lines for @xmath11 , and the vertical first - order phase transition lines for @xmath198 and @xmath194 , meet at one point .",
    "the second - order phase transition line for @xmath194 touches to the first - order phase transition line for @xmath198 .",
    "we consider the sequence of the melting of the diquark condensates . in the cfl phase , as @xmath45 is increased with @xmath18 fixed , we find that the @xmath11 becomes zero firstly , and the @xmath194 secondary . in the analysis of the njl models@xcite , on the contrary , it was found that @xmath194 melts firstly and @xmath11 secondary , and then the phase with only @xmath194 finite is not found .",
    "the 2sc phase ( where only @xmath11 finite ) above the cfl phase may also be expected in qcd .",
    "the reason is explained as follows@xcite : around the melting temperature , the quark fermi spheres are smeared and then the sizes of gaps are mainly dominated by the density of states . because the larger @xmath196 makes the strange quark fermi sphere smaller , its density of states is smaller than that of the ud quarks , which results in the smaller @xmath194 than @xmath11 .",
    "this indicates the preceding melting of @xmath194 .",
    "we consider that the contradicting result of our model is due to the absence of the fermi sphere in our treatment , and , unfortunately , that this is a limitation of our model .",
    "we have studied a chrm model which can treat the competition between the chiral and the diquark condensates in the case with three flavors , to investigate the phase diagram with the cfl phase . in order to describe the color superconductivity ,",
    "we have introduced the color and lorentz indices to the truncated dirac matrix .",
    "the random matrices mimicking the gauge fields are taken to be real matrices , whose elements are distributed according to the gaussian weight . after the integration over the random matrices , we are left with the four fermion interaction term , which contains not only quark - antiquark interaction vertices , but also quark - quark vertices . using fierz transformations ,",
    "the ratio of the coefficients is uniquely determined .",
    "applying the bosonization techniques , we finally derive the effective potential as the function of the order parameters , the chiral condensates and the diquark condensates .    the phase diagram on the @xmath45-@xmath18 plane is calculated by solving the gap equations simultaneously . in the case with three equal - mass quark flavors ,",
    "we find the cfl phase in the large chemical potential region , while the chirally - broken phase in the small chemical potential region . in the region where the cfl condensate is zero , the phase diagram is equivalent to that obtained from the conventional chrm model without the diquark condensations .",
    "the cfl condensates become zero continuously , as @xmath45 and/or @xmath18 are increased . the unphysical phase transition at large @xmath18",
    "may be considered as the result of the fact that the chrm model does not contain the fermi surface . when finite quark mass @xmath138 is introduced , the phase transition line for the cfl phase moves towards the larger chemical potential region .",
    "we also find that the region of the cfl phase becomes smaller as @xmath138 is increased .    for the case with 2 + 1 flavors , @xmath200 and @xmath195",
    ", we find both the cfl and the 2sc phases .",
    "moreover , we find the phase where @xmath194 has a finite value and @xmath139 . such phase is not found in the njl model , and not expected in qcd .",
    "we also consider this phase may be an model artifact due to the absence of the fermi surface , but can not be excluded from the viewpoint of the symmetry .",
    "although there are unphysical points , the chrm model studied in this paper can consistently address both the chirally broken phase and the cfl phase .",
    "in addition , with the finite asymmetry between the ud quarks and the strange quark , the model also can show the 2sc phase .",
    "because the chrm model includes the dirac matrix , investigation of its eigenvalue distribution , the dirac spectrum , may be possible",
    ". it may be possible to understand the phase transition into the diquark - condensed states in the context of the moving of the dirac eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , in the microscopic region , there might be the universal structure of the dirac spectrum , which can be compared to the other models at high density@xcite .",
    "the applications in these directions are postponed to future studies .    finally , we consider an outlook or a possible extension of the model .",
    "one of the most important effect we neglect is the u(1 ) breaking axial anomaly effect .",
    "it is known that , in the chrm model , the anomaly effect introduces the flavor mixing , which changes the phase diagram drastically@xcite .",
    "indeed , we find that the effective potential in the case with 2 + 1 flavors and @xmath184 can be separated to the ud quark sector and the strange quark sector , as a result of the absence of the mixing effect . moreover , on the phase diagram around mid chemical potential , it is suggested that the anomaly effect , which also mixes the chiral and the diquark order parameters , plays a crucial role on the phase structure with the various superconducting phases@xcite .",
    "we are then interested to combine the treatment of the chrm model with the color superconducting phases presented here , and of the chrm model with the axial anomaly in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the effects of the axial anomaly on the phase structure with the color superconducting phases .",
    "it will allow us to discuss the phase structure at finite temperature and density from a viewpoint of the symmetry .",
