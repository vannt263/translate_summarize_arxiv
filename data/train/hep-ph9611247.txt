    "an important issue in high energy physics is to understand the mechanism of mass generation . in the standard model , a fundamental complex higgs scalar",
    "is introduced to break the electroweak symmetry and generate masses .",
    "however , arguments of triviality and naturalness suggest that the symmetry breaking sector of the standard model is just an effective theory .",
    "the top quark , with a mass of the order of the weak scale , is singled out to play a key role in probing the new physics beyond the standard model@xcite .",
    "if anomalous top quark couplings were to exist , their effects could show up in the top quark production rate @xcite , the partial decay width of @xmath6 measured at lep @xcite @xcite , fcnc processes at low energies @xcite and in top quark decays@xcite .",
    "the new experimental value for @xmath7@xcite is higher than the standard model prediction of @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "this still could be a possible first hint of new physics associated with the heavy top quark @xcite .    recently with chris hill , one of the authors @xcite(x .",
    "zhang ) studied the correlated effects of new dynamics , which sensitively involves the top quark , on @xmath2 and the top pair production rate at the tevatron . in this paper",
    "we will study the impact of possible new physics on the single top quark production rate at the tevatron .",
    "it was shown in ref@xcite that the signal for single top production in @xmath10 via a virtual s - channel @xmath11 is potentially observable at the tevatron .",
    "the signal for this process is unobservable at the lhc because of the large background from @xmath12 production and single top production via w - gluon fusion@xcite .",
    "compared to the single top production via w - gluon fusion the process @xmath10 has the advantage that the cross section can be calculated reliably because the quark and antiquark structure functions at the relevant values of @xmath13 are better known than the gluon structure functions that enter in the calculation for the w - gluon cross section .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to show that certain types of new physics , after being constrained by the new value of @xmath2 , can still show significant effects on the single top production rate at the tevatron . in particular for operators that generate anomalous vertices with a @xmath14 dependence one would naively expect new physics effects in single top production to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath15 compared to new physics effects in @xmath2",
    ". similar enhancement effects , in models of new physics used to explain @xmath2 , could also be expected at lep ii @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the phenomenology of @xmath16 and the single top production rate at the tevatron . in section iii , we summarize our results .",
    "@xcite , several operators in the effective lagrangian relevant to @xmath2 were considered . among them",
    "operators , @xmath18 in the notation of ref.@xcite are relevant to the single top production .",
    "since @xmath19 strongly constrains the strength of the anomalous right - handed charged current for the third family @xcite , we focus here only on the operator @xmath20 . explicitly operator @xmath21 can be reduced to four - fermi operator by using equation of motion@xcite , which gives contact terms , such as @xmath22 .",
    "when calculating the cross section for process @xmath23 , one gets the same matrix element with or without using the equation of motion . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the su(2 ) field strength , @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28    this operator , modifying the @xmath29 couplings along with the @xmath30 vertex , could be generated in models where the top quark has a composite structure@xcite and/or a soliton structure@xcite , in the strong etc models@xcite and in models where the top quark has new strong interactions@xcite .",
    "it may also be generated in the weakly interacting theories , such as susy and multi - higgs models with relatively smaller coeffecients .",
    "the effective lagrangian is written as we have not included the four - fermi operators involving the top and bottom quarks@xcite , which can only indirectly affect @xmath2 and the single top production rate at one - loop , but not directly as the operator , @xmath31 does at the tree level . ]",
    "@xmath32 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the lagrangian of the standard model and @xmath34 is the scale of new physics .",

    "can be extracted by using the formula@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath2 and @xmath43 are the experimental value and the standard model prediction respectively .",
    "the cross section for @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 \\sigma(u{\\overline d}\\rightarrow t{\\overline b } ) .",

    "in fig . 1 , we plot @xmath57 vs @xmath2 where @xmath58 is the change in the single top production cross section in the presence of higher dimensional operators in the lagrangian and @xmath59 is the standard model cross section for single top production .",
    "one can see from the figure that if one requires the new physics to bring the prediction of @xmath2 to the central value of the experimental data , @xmath60 , then its correction to the single top rate is around @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , if we fit @xmath2 to the experimental value within 1 @xmath59 then the correction due to new physics to the single top production rate could be @xmath62 .",
    "we have not included the qcd and yukawa corrections@xcite to the single top quark production rate .",
    "they will enhance the total rate , but not change the percentage of the new physics correction to the cross section . ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the correlated effects of new physics on @xmath2 and the cross section of the single top production at the tevatron .",
    "our results show that the correction to the single top quark production rate due to the new physics responsible for @xmath2 could be @xmath63 at the tevatron .",
    "given that the single top cross section ( via @xmath64 ) can be measured at tevatron run 2 and run 3 with a precision of @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively@xcite , our study here provides a theoretical argument for such a measurement in order to probe new physics beyond the standard model .",
