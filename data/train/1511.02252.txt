    "some crystals undergo a solid - to - solid phase transformation upon decreasing temperature , the _ martensitic transformation _ , characterized by an abrupt change in the crystalline lattice structure  @xcite . above the transition temperature , the crystal is in the austenite phase , with a lattice unit cell that typically has greater crystallographic symmetry ( such as cubic ) . in the low - temperature , _ martensite phase _ , two or more symmetry - related _ variants _ coexist ;",
    "for instance , in a cubic - to - tetragonal transformation , the low - temperature variants correspond to tetragonal unit cells with the symmetry axes parallel to each of the three cartesian axes .",
    "the transformation is both reversible and _ self - accommodating _ ,",
    "i.e. it does not involve a net change in the material shape .",
    "a fascinating microstructure originates in the self - accommodating property : martensite variants form fine laminates , compatibly merged together along twin boundaries .",
    "the martensite microstructure , along with the fact that there is only one variant of austenite , ultimately lead to very interesting behavior , such as the shape - memory effect  @xcite .",
    "a beautiful theory of the martensitic microstructure is based on a nonlinear elasticity model  @xcite .",
    "this theory combines techniques extracted from several branches of mathematics , from nonlinear analysis and the calculus of variations to partial differential equations and geometry .",
    "the experimental existence of crystal laminates , where the deformation gradient jumps when crossing a boundary across a smooth surface , makes room for the use of functions where the partial derivatives are only required to exist in a weak sense .",

    "for instance , @xmath84 for a cubic - to - tetragonal transformation , with the variant strains characterizing volume - conserving uniaxial deformations along each cartesian direction : @xmath85    now consider a surface @xmath86 separating two crystal variants , so that @xmath76 is continuous on either side of @xmath86 , and the limits @xmath87 and @xmath88 for a point @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . to ensure that the tangential derivatives are equal at @xmath91 , and that the deformation field is continuous at the boundary , one uses the compatibility condition ( or hadamard jump condition ) : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a vector that is normal to the surface @xmath86 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is a @xmath96 matrix .    the lack of convexity ( strictly speaking : _ quasiconvexity _ ) of @xmath97 , suggests that the minimum of the free energy functional @xmath98 $ ] is not attained .",
    "one can assume without loss of generality that @xmath99 , for @xmath100 , and that the infimum of the total free energy is also zero .",

    "the young measure gives the limiting distribution ( @xmath107 ) of the values of @xmath106 in a small neighbourhood of each point @xmath14 .",
    "this theory uses sophisticated real analysis , and provides an elegant explanation of why fine microstructures are formed .",
    "another instance of interesting microstructure formation , which can sometimes be regarded as a kind of toy model of the martensitic microstructure , is the folding of a piece of paper in the plane  @xcite ( see problems 11.7 and 11.8 of  @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a sheet of paper with a different color , e.g. white and grey , on each of its sides .",
    "the state of the paper , as in the martensite case , is completely characterized by the position vector field in target space @xmath108 , where @xmath14 gives the position in reference space ( which we assume to have the grey face up ) , which in this case is in a bounded region @xmath72 of @xmath109 .",
    "two - dimensional proper rotations by an angle @xmath110 do not alter the paper free energy , so that the system is invariant under the action of @xmath111 .",
    "the free energy is also invariant under a flip of the paper over the horizontal direction , achieved via an application of @xmath112 in @xmath14 , followed by a proper rotation by @xmath113 , i.e. the system is invariant under the action of @xmath114 .",

    "<S> [ fig : smecticmicrostructure ] show compatible boundaries in the smectic microstructure given by the ellipses and hyperbolas of eq .  .    </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the compatibility condition for 3d smectic domains will lead to boundaries , as described by friedel  @xcite , which are portions of right circular cones connecting one point of a conic to its confocal partner .    </S>",
    "<S> how have we altered the standard theory of martensites ? </S>",
    "<S> firstly , our elastic free energy density is written in terms of the gradients of @xmath70 , and hence _ second _ derivatives of the displacement field @xmath1  a strain gradient theory . </S>",
    "<S> second , our domains are not described by a uniform deformation , but rather by a deformation determined by the non - local constraints  @xcite imposed by the constraint of one - dimensional singularies . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , what further can we glean from the martensitic analogy ? the mathematical engineers use sophisticated real analysis ( minimizing sequences and young measure distributions ) to describe the family of boundary conditions that can be relaxed by an infinitely fine microstructure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apollonian microstructures formed by a hierarchy of ellipses are known to mediate smectic tilt boundaries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an infinitely fine laminate of alternating concentric spheres and dupin domains , inspired by the experimental ` flower texture ' , has been shown to relax an arbitrary cylindrically symmetric boundary condition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the general question remains a fascinating one : what is the class of smectic boundary conditions that can be mediated by structures of equally spaced layers with only line singularities ?    </S>",
