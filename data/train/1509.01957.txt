    "animal living in groups are constrained by what they can perceive thus most of the time they can not have a global view of the group and their environment .",
    "yet those species are capable of remarkable group behaviours .",
    "the question arises as to understand what kind of mechanism allows the group to perform so well given their individual limitations .",
    "several forms of social structures exists that go from all individuals apparently having the same weight in the group to various forms of leadership and social hierarchy . + among the many group - living species , the chicken ( _ gallus gallus domesticus _ ) is an interesting animal model : the chickens are social animals and chicks present a social attachment to their siblings and to their mother .",
    "indeed , in precocial birds such as chickens , the formation of social attachments occurs in the first days after hatching .",
    "this process is used as a model for the study of learning @xcite because the chicks environment and conditions prior to hatching can be controlled and standardized .",
    "hence , the period immediately after hatching is likely to be particularly useful for studying social motivation and learning . +",
    "this social structure allows to address the question of the role of leadership in group decision - making .",
    "chicks are attracted to each other and at the same time they tend to remain in a relatively close vicinity to their mother that they can also follow as a group .",
    "the question arises as to what makes the group coherent and what is the importance of the leader , the hen , in group decision making and group coherence .",
    "the development of filial behaviour can be separated in terms of two interacting processes : filial motivation and filial imprinting .",
    "filial motivation causes chicks to approach and follow conspicuous objects with certain general properties like colours , shapes , sizes , and movement patterns . in a natural environment , chicks are attracted toward the hen and the other chicks of the group .",
    "filial imprinting is a learning process through which the chick comes to restrict this behaviour to focus to particular stimuli @xcite .",
    "as chicks become progressively more familiar with an object , they tend to approach this object more @xcite .",
    "thus , filial motivation determines the propensity to make social attachments , while imprinting establishes preference .",
    "+ in ethological studies one of the long - standing interests is to understand social communication , relationships and structures . until recently ,",
    "to study these mechanisms researchers had used simple specially designed mock - ups whose behaviour can be controlled so as to trigger a response of the animals . but nowadays availability of low - cost miniaturized computer chips , motors and sensors allowed these artificial models to become sophisticated and reliable robotic devices that can be used to test hypotheses @xcite .",
    "for instance , robots were used to study male territorial instinct in dart - poison frogs @xcite and mate selection in tungara frogs @xcite , to test ideas about nest mate recognition in brush turkeys @xcite , and the predator avoidance by ground squirrels @xcite .",
    "a number of recent works in ethology have successfully used robots to investigate individual and collective animal behaviours , in particular by creating mixed robot - animals societies : robots were mixed with chicks @xcite , cockroaches @xcite , fruit flies @xcite , killifish @xcite and zebrafish @xcite .",
    "+ here , we address these questions by using a robot ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that will become a surrogate mother to individual chicks . to build a social attachment between the chicks and the robot we use the filial imprinting mechanism .",
    "after hatching a critical period exists where the chick will learn to build social attachment to specific objects .",
    "classical ethology has shown that this special form of learning works for any object remaining close to the chicks and presenting specific colour , movement and sound patterns . in this study",
    ", we develop an imprinting methodology involving autonomous robots to study individual behaviour of free moving animals .",
    "thanks to this methodology we are able to quantify the individual behaviours and social responses to the robot .",
    "we also develop automated experimental methodologies that allow to make fast and efficient data analysis , and compare to existing ones @xcite .",
    "a workflow of this methodology is found in fig .",
    "the analysis is based on high throughput data allowing fine quantification of individual behavioural traits .",
    "thanks to this method we can make quantitative assessment of individual variability of a large number of individuals .",

    "we then perform a new quantification of individual behaviour traits , and compare them to original results .",
    "additional experiments include experiments during the period of time the chicks are put into groups , where entire groups of chicks interact with a robot , but the associated results are not investigated in this article . here",
    ", we quantify the individual characteristics for 205 animals .",
    "the results show a large variability of behavioural patterns .",
    "one of the main variability is related to the success of imprinting .",
    "three types of chicks are observed : imprinted , indifferent and avoiders . among the successfully imprinted chicks we still observe a large variability of behavioural patterns .",
    "finally we show that the use of autonomous robots and automated ethograms allow detailed quantitative studies of animal behavioural patterns as it has also been shown with drosophila flies and bees @xcite .",
    "the first step in the behavioural analysis is to classify the chicks according to the success of the filial imprinting on the robot .",
    "filial imprinting corresponds to the propensity of the chicks to be attracted by the robot and to follow it as if it was the hen mother .",
    "we observe two different kind of non - imprinted chicks : indifferent chicks that ignore the presence and movement of the robot , and avoiders that run along the walls , possibly running away from the robot .",
    "imprinting success is assessed by looking at the behavioural response of the chicks towards the robot . + figure [ fig3 ] shows both the speed of three different chicks depending of their spatial position in the arena , and the robot trajectories .",
    "the figure shows the three typical behaviour responses of a chick to the robot : a chick can be imprinted ( panel a ) , indifferent ( panel b ) , or avoider ( panel c ) .",
    "the distributions of chicks speed , their distance toward the robot , and their walking behaviour ( whether they are walking or stopping ) , for 30 individuals , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . imprinted and avoider chicks tend to alternate a walking behaviour with small stops .",
    "indifferent chicks stay in place in the arena , with very few apparent walking behaviour .",
    "imprinted chicks tend to be close to the robot .",
    "indifferent and avoider chicks tend to be distant from the robot .",
    "the three typical behaviour responses of a chick to the robot correspond to different distributions of chick speeds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : imprinted chicks move with variable speed , indifferent chicks do not move much , avoider chicks tend to move at higher speed than imprinted chicks .",
    "+ the classification of the behavioural response of each chick toward the robot can be done by a human observer looking at all the videos . however , this represents a tedious and long qualitative work that would greatly benefit from automation .",
    "only @xmath0 of all experiments ( 64 individuals ) is classified by a human observer .",
    "the rest of the experiments is classified automatically , using an algorithm to classify the data automatically extracted from the videos by image analysis .",
    "+ because it is possible for a human observer to classify with good accuracy the type of chick , we select a supervised learning method .",
    "we use a linear support vector machine ( svm ) classifier , an algorithm often used to solve problems in classification , regression , and novelty detection @xcite .",
    "this method is first trained on the human - classified dataset , separating experiments into three classes : imprinted , avoider , indifferent .",
    "the classification process used the following features : _ mean distance between a robot and a chick _ , _ mean speed of a chick _ , and its _ standard deviation_. the results of the classification are presented in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",

    ", width=264 ]      ethograms are typically used to describe animal behaviour .",
    "they are made usually by human experts consistently documenting behaviour from observations .",
    "the two main approaches are focal sampling ( in which the human expert make systematic observation of the behaviour of an individual  it is a precise but time - expensive method ) and scan sampling ( in which the observer only uses observation recorded at regular intervals to classify behaviours  it is less time - consuming compared to focal sampling , but also less accurate ) .",
    "ethograms done by human observation are time consuming and tedious if one wants to obtain quantitative results .",
    "we present a combined methodology that performs detailed quantitative studies of single individual repeated for a large number of animals ( 205 individuals ) .",
    "+ recently , a number of ethological studies have used similar methodologies to automatically generate ethograms of animal behaviour from behavioural data @xcite .",
    "this process of automatic behaviours detection is call `` automated ethology '' , and produces `` automated ethograms '' .",
    "it is usually done in two steps .",
    "the first step is called `` segmentation '' : the trajectories are split into segments .",
    "each segment is labelled independently from the others , using either classification or clustering algorithms . in the second step , a label ( or `` class '' )",
    "is assigned to each segment , describing which kind of behaviour the chick is exhibiting as the corresponding time .",
    "two kind of algorithms can be used for labelling : classification algorithms and clustering algorithms . for each segment",
    ", these algorithms use a set of features ( statistical measures ) of the observed individual to find a corresponding label . before the labelling process ,",
    "classification algorithms need to be trained with a training set of segments already labelled by a human .",
    "this training set is used as reference ( or _ a priori _ knowledge ) to guide the labelling process .",
    "clustering algorithm do not need to be trained beforehand , and only uses the similarity of the segments features to group them together into clusters .",
    "each cluster correspond to a different label .",
    "+ the segmentation strategy can impact the reliability of the labelling process of trajectories compared to a labelling done by humans .",
    "this is especially the case when segments incorporate periods of time when the chicks exhibit several different behaviour .",
    "on the other hand , when segments are too small , it can add noise into the features used for labelling . in an optimal segmentation",
    ", segments end when a chick changes its behaviour . a typical segmentation method used in the literature",
    "is the @xmath6-steps window segmentation : trajectories containing @xmath7 time - steps are split into @xmath8 segments each with a size of @xmath6 time - steps .",
    "an extreme case is the @xmath9-step window segmentation , where every time - step is a new segment .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath6 can influence the reliability of a segmentation : if @xmath6 is too big , segments can include period of times where the chicks exhibit several different behaviours",
    ". on the other hand , @xmath6-step window segmentation with a low @xmath6 can be more sensitive to noise .",
    "+ we introduce a more robust segmentation method , the threshold crossing method .",
    "we make two hypothesises , supported by human observations : first , that chicks reduce their speed below a given threshold when they change behaviour ; second , that chicks accelerate when they begin to exhibit a given behaviour , and decelerate when they change behaviour .",
    "this allow us to introduce an original segmentation method , that we call threshold crossing. this segmentation method is based on the speed and acceleration of a chick ( fig .",

    "+    ) the animal is considered as not moving .",
    "to further segment intervals during which the animal is moving , the criteria is based on the acceleration .",

    ", the trajectory is segmented .",
    "then a new segment is started where the animal has changed its movement type . in the shown example of experimental data ,",

    "[ sec : behaviouralmeasurments ] and [ sec : classificationandclusteringoftrajectories ] . for each segment , the classification and clustering algorithms use the following features ( statistical measures ) to find a label ( corresponding to the behaviour of the chick ) : the mean speed of the chick , the acceleration of the chick , the distance between the chick and the robot , the distance between the chick and the wall of the arena , and the distance traveled by the chick during the experiment .",

    "we named it the _ poulbot_. the robot is a configuration of the marxbot robot  a modular research robot developed at epfl @xcite .",
    "the poulbot consists of the following modules : a _ base module _ providing energy , means for locomotion , a gyroscope , an accelerometer , 24 short range infrared proximity sensors around the robot and a speaker , a _ colour pattern module _ allowing a robot to carry a specific pattern , an extra _ ring of proximity sensors _ placed above the colour pattern module and a _ main computer board _ with a 533mhz freescale i.mx31 and an omnidirectional camera , the main board also provides wi - fi and bluetooth wireless connectivity . on the top of the robot we fixed three colour markers used to track the robot position and orientation with a camera fixed above the experimental setup ( see below ) .",
    "every module of the robot consists of one or several microchip dspic33 microcontrollers that drive the sensors and/or actuators of the module .",
    "the microcontrollers are connected with each other and with the main computer of the robot through a controller - area network ( can ) bus .",
    "the robot can be extended with the sound acquisition module and with the pecking module .",
    "+ the control system of our robot is a hierarchical behaviour based controller @xcite .",
    "the robot is equipped with a set of primitive behaviours tightly bonded with the sensors and actuators of the robot .",
    "each primitive behaviour serves to achieve a particular goal or to perform a specific activity ( e.g. , _ wall - following _ or _ obstacle - avoidance _ behaviours ) . the primitive behaviours are combined together to form higher level composite behaviours for specific experiments .",
    "behaviour - based systems work well in dynamic environments , in cases when fast reaction and high adaptability are important .",
    "these characteristics make the behaviour based approach a natural choice when designing a control system for a robot that interacts with animals .",
    "we performed experiments with chicks , _ gallus gallus domesticus _ , from hatching up to @xmath69 week - old .",
    "as breed , we chose the egg layer white leghorn that is common in scientific studies .",
    "the incubators were disposed together in a @xmath101 isolated rearing room that was maintained in the dark and at a constant temperature of @xmath102 during incubation .",
    "eggs were incubated at the classical temperature of @xmath103 with a relative humidity of @xmath104 .",
    "after hatching , chicks were identified with numbered plastic rings their hatching time was recorded .",
    "they were left to rest and dry in the incubators .",
    "when dry , they were kept in the dark in individual boxes until the imprinting process .",
    "the light was left off to reduce imprinting of first hatched chicks on siblings .",
    "the presence of humans was reduced to the minimum necessary for handling . during hatching ,",
    "the frequency of visit by experimentalists was of @xmath9 hour .",
    "+ during incubation and up to the imprinting process , two speakers and a mp3 device played a calibrated sound sound that the robots also played during imprinting and tests .",
    "the sound was played from egg state to the end of the imprinting sessions .",
    "this calibrated sound had a frequency of @xmath105 and with a beep duration of @xmath106 and interval between two beeps of @xmath107 .",
    "these features have been chosen in correspondence to the range of chick audition @xcite .",
    "we chose the upper threshold of the range and a sound designed to be neutral since it is totally artificial , which means that it is not related to a natural chick or hen calls , such as alarm calls or clucking , and have thus no biological sense .",
    "this was made for auditory imprinting not oriented towards a special message signal .",
    "+ after the imprinting process , chicks are kept in groups of @xmath84 in breeding nurseries and given food and water _",
    "ad libitum_. the temperature of the breeding room was reduced during the three weeks from @xmath108 to @xmath109 according to breeding standards .",
    "we ran open - field tests , where animals and robots were released on a flat arena surrounded by walls and their behaviour was studied .",
    "the experimental arena is a flat square of @xmath69  m by @xmath69  m , surrounded by a wooden wall of @xmath110 cm in height .",
    "a common daylight lamp is a source of a strong infrared ( ir ) emission that affects the ir sensors of the robot . to resolve this issue , we used lamps with reduced infrared emission fq49w/965 by osram .",

    "the experimental pc has an eight - core intel core@xmath1132 quad processor and 2 gb of ram .",
    "it runs the monitoring and recording software presented in the next section and the gui module of the robot control system .",
    "it also serves as a temporary storage of the experimental data recorded during the day , before the data is transferred to external hard drives .",

    "+            the imprinting procedure precedes every series of experiments . depending on birth rates",
    ", we tried to compose imprinting batches with chicks born within at most two hour intervals .",
    "this was made to have a sufficient number of chicks per imprinting session . to perform",
    "the imprinting we build an arena composed of two rows of boxes on the sides .",
    "four boxes were built in mdf wood with a plexiglas side facing the wall to let chicks see the robot that traveled back and forth in front of them .",
    "wooden boxes were @xmath114x@xmath115x@xmath116 mm .",
    "each box had ten compartments of @xmath115x@xmath115 mm to house one chick at a time . by putting one chick per box",
    "the setup allowed the simultaneous imprinting of 40 chicks .",
    "four robots moved along the walls in front of each box at a close distance of about @xmath117 mm , forward and backward , at a speed of @xmath110 mm / s , one in front of each box .",
    "the robots emitted a calibrate sounds that was the same as during incubation and hatching ( see above ) and displayed a specific colour pattern .",
    "this individual and in - line imprinting process was designed to reduce imprinting among siblings .",
    "we performed the imprinting sessions according to the optimal period for chicken filial imprinting the the first exposure to the robots was 9 hours after hatching @xcite . the first exposure",
    "was programmed 9 hours after the birth of the chicks .",
    "three sessions of one hour in the presence of the robot were done interrupted in - between by one hour resting time in the breeding room .",
    "rotation were done to imprint all chicks of a hatching batch ( 100 individuals at most ) . +",
    "shortly after an end of the imprinting procedure we tested all chicks : every chick was left for a half an hour with a robot _ wandering _ on the experimental arena and chick behaviour was observed .",
    "the robot emits a calibrated beeping sound and moves straight at a constant speed of @xmath118 mm / s .",
    "when the robot reaches an edge of the set - up it bounces back with a random angle .",
    "the speed of the robot was selected according to observation of the mean chick speed during previous calibration experiments .",
    "each test lasted for 30 minutes and for data analysis the first 2 minutes are skipped and the next 25 minutes are kept .",
    "this avoids artifacts due to animal introduction and extraction from the experimental setup .",
    "all tests were recorded and stored as digital videos for further processing .",
    "the chicks were tested , one after the other , in the sequence corresponding to their age , older first , younger last .      for classifying chicks imprinting success , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : classificationres ] , we used a linear support vector machine ( svm ) classifier , a supervised learning method that is often used to solve problems in classification , regression , and novelty detection @xcite .",
    "+ classification using linear svm is performed by solving the problem of finding a hyperplane partitioning the training dataset . during training ,",
    "the examples of separate classes are separated by a gap that is as wide as possible .",
    "we make the hypothesis that our exploration space can be linearly separated , so using linear svm ( instead of the non - linear svm using kernel function @xcite ) is sufficient .",
    "svm is fundamentally a two - class classifier , but a number of methods exist to handle a higher number of classes @xcite .",
    "+ the libsvm ( version 3.0 ) @xcite was used to perform the classification .",
    "+ we used the following statistics on chicks and robot movements as relevant features ( explanatory variables ) for the classification process : _ mean distance between a robot and a chick _",
    ", _ mean speed of a chick _ , and its _",
    "standard deviation_. we reduced the dimensionality of the related feature vector from three to two by using principal components analysis ( pca ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting dataset was used to train a three - class svm classifier .",
    "+ the training takes about 6  milliseconds ( with 64 individuals ) and the classification takes about 7  milliseconds ( for 205 individuals ) with matlab r2011b running on an ordinary laptop pc ( lenovo thinkpad t60p , linux ubuntu 12.04 ) .",
    "moreover , for individual tests the extraction of the chick and robot positions is done automatically in real time during the recording of the test .",
    "thus the classifier allows to categorize , in real time , rapidly , large batches of experiments saving a huge amount of experimental time .",
    "the recorded experimental videos were analyzed during the experimental run using a swistrack that is an open source multi - platform tracking software @xcite .",
    "the robot position and orientation are defined by three colour markers on top of it .",
    "thus the detection of robots and chicks is colour based .",
    "the coordinates of the robots and the animals extracted from the video were mapped to the real - world coordinates ( in mm ) by using the calibration routine based on the well known tsai s calibration technique @xcite . in order to remove high frequency noise introduced into trajectories by the detection errors ,",
    "every trajectory is filtered by using the savitzky - golay smoothing filter @xcite . +",
    "this trajectories are then segmented .",
    "the segmentation process identify segments of the trajectories ( i.e. : group of continuous time - steps in the chicks behavioural traces ) when the chick exhibit a particular behaviour .",
    "this is a first step toward labelling the trajectories with the observed behaviour of the chicks toward the robot . in an optimal segmentation",
    ", segments should end when a chick changes into behaviour . a typical segmentation method used in the literature",
    "is the @xmath6-steps window segmentation : trajectories containing @xmath7 time - steps are split into @xmath8 segments each with a size of @xmath6 time - steps .",
    "an extreme case is the @xmath9-step window segmentation , where every time - step is a new segment .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath6 can influence the reliability of a segmentation : if @xmath6 is too big , segments can include period of times where the chicks exhibit several different behaviours",
    ". on the other hand , @xmath6-step window segmentation with a low @xmath6 can be more sensitive to noise .",
    "we introduce a more robust segmentation method , the threshold crossing method .",
    "we make two hypothesises , supported by human observations : first , that chicks reduce their speed below a given threshold when they change behaviour ; second , that chicks accelerate when they begin to exhibit a given behaviour , and decelerate when they change behaviour .",
    "this allow us to introduce an original segmentation method , that we call threshold crossing. this segmentation method is based on the speed and acceleration of a chick ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) : time - steps when the speed or acceleration of a chicks are below predefined thresholds are considered as stops .      to find the quantitative representation of these behaviours in the parameter space we use either classification algorithms or clustering algorithms . to prepare the training set we manually labeled a number of segments of trajectories , obtained using the segmentation method described in [ sec : behaviouralmeasurments ] .",
    "while classification algorithms are trained on human - labelled data , clustering algorithms identify behaviours without any training .",
    "either techniques will label observation data into 7 classes of behaviours : _",
    "`` stops '' , `` joins '' , `` follows '' , `` in front '' , `` loops'',``bumped '' _ and _ `` other '' _ , which reflect the activity of the chick , and its relation to the movements of the robot .",
    "the python library scikit - learn was used to perform all classification and clustering operations . + ( 1 ) decision trees ( @xcite , * dt * in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "decision trees correspond to a recursive partitioning of the training set into several homogeneous subsets .",
    "it has a flowchart structure where nodes and branches represent conditions ( expressing how to partition the training set ) , and leafs nodes represent class labels .",
    "decision trees are non - parameter and nonlinear , and so can be used in cases when little is known a - priori about the relationship between the variables .",
    "they are also simple to interpret and verify by a human .",
    "the classification could incur a loss due to overfitting , a pruning mechanism @xcite was used to solve this issue .",
    "+ ( 2 ) random forests ( * dt / forest * in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "it is a variation of the decision tree method : one can use an ensemble of trees , that is known as a random forest @xcite , instead of a single tree , to increase the accuracy of classification .",
    "+ ( 3 ) a k - nearest neighbours classifier , with an euclidean distance metric @xcite .",
    "this algorithm makes use of a measure of similarity between all the training records and the features of the object to be classified , then identify the most similar @xmath95 neighbours of all objects , and determine each object class by an object by a majority vote of its neighbours ( i.e. assign the class which is the most frequent among the @xmath95 training records nearest to that object ) .",
    "note that knn classifiers are known to be sensitives to noisy , irrelevant features , or by the difference of scaling of the features @xcite .",
    "that may explain the classification results ( table  [ table1 ] ) , where knn was out - performed by other algorithms .",
    "+ ( 4 ) linear multi - class svm classifier , as described in section [ sec : classificationmethod ] .",
    "+ ( 5 ) k - means @xcite .",
    "this clustering algorithm partitions the observations into @xmath119 clusters , in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean .",
    "the results are akin to partitioning the data space into voronoi cells .",
    "convergence speed can be greatly affected by the choice of initial values .",
    "we use the popular k - means++ @xcite algorithm for choosing initial values .",
    "this study validates the use of imprinting to ensure a social bond between robots and animals in order to perform controlled experiments with calibrated stimuli and sustained social interactions .",
    "when the robots are accepted by the animals , they can be programmed to keep sustained social interactions with them in long duration trials ( our experiments lasted 30 minutes ) .",
    "as the robots are autonomous and work in close loop of interactions with the animals , they allow to avoid any human interference during the trials .",
    "the whole set - up presented here works in absence of humans in the experimental room and without supervision .",
    "the robots can be programmed to produce calibrated and repetitive multi - modal stimuli including visual ( colour patterns ) , sound ( prerecorded natural cues or totally artificial ) and motion patterns .",
    "+ moreover , we build a framework that allows automation of high throughput data analysis . from the positions of animals and their dynamics in time we construct quantitative automated ethograms . + we test state - of - the - art algorithms to automate data analysis and show that supervised method based on decision tree with forest gives the best results .",
    "we also show that simple unsupervised methods such as k - means already gives interesting results . here , the algorithms allow to combine the knowledge of human experts with fast computational methods .",
    "it is then possible to analyze the experimental data of 205 animals in a few minutes on modern computers .",
    "+ this paper has two contributions .",
    "first , we introduce a methodology that allows the automated generation of quantified ethograms both on the individual level ( represented by sequences of labelled behaviours ) and on the group level ( represented by finite state machines ) .",
    "second , we investigate the individual variability of chicks in term of imprinting , using a classification algorithm . results also confirm that social bonding have an influence on the imprinting quality . we observe that , after being put in groups , chicks have an imprinting quality toward the robot that is closer to the average of their group .",
    "a chick that originally was not very interested in the robot develops a stronger attachment after being placed in the group of individuals strongly imprinted toward the robot . on the other hand , a chick that originally was very attached to the robot",
    "become less interested in the robot after being placed in the group of individuals that have a low interest toward the robot .",
    "+ this methodology is a first step towards mathematical modelling based on quantified ethograms , and this study is a first step toward making the link between inter - individual variability and collective behaviour . in our methodology , we first study and quantify individually each chick .",
    "then , the chicks are put in different grouping configuration , according to their inter - individual variability .",
    "an interesting and on - going perspective is to make a group behaviour analysis taking in account the chicks individual behavioural traits , and the group composition .",
