    "similar to the two - qubit case , the concurrence can be enhanced for moderate systems by modifying the external controllable laser parameters , i.e. @xmath83 , as well as the dipole - dipole interactions @xmath4 . for a fixed dipole - dipole interaction , the concurrence increases while changing the qubit - laser detuning and then decreases with an additional increase of the detuning ( see fig .",
