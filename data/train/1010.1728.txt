    "the understanding of charge dependence of strong interactions has been a crucial issue in nuclear physics ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the simplest place where this issue can be studied is the nucleon - nucleon interaction . as it is well known , isospin invariance is not an exact symmetry of strong interactions . as a consequence nuclear forces",
    "have a small but net charge - dependent component . by definition , _ charge independence _ means invariance under any rotation in isospin space .",
    "a violation of this symmetry is referred to as charge dependence or charge independence breaking ( cib ) and it means in particular that , in the isospin @xmath2 state , the proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) , neutron - proton ( @xmath4 ) , or neutron - neutron ( @xmath5 ) _ strong _ interactions are different . a particular case , known as charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) , only considers the difference between proton - proton ( @xmath6 ) and neutron - neutron ( @xmath7 ) interactions .",
    "further corrections are expected when , in addition , coulomb forces are added to the proton - proton system ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "but , what is the scale of charge symmetry breaking ? . actually , the effects are important in the s - wave channel where an unnaturally large scattering length , due to a virtual state   in that partial wave , triggers a high short distance sensitivity .",
    "this , of course amplifies effects related to variations in the short distance parameters _ precisely _ in the region where the interaction and hence the charge symmetry breaking effects may be less reliable .",
    "the current understanding is that cib , and in particular csb , are due to a mass difference between the up and down quarks and electromagnetic interactions . on the hadronic level and in a one - boson - exchange ( obe )",
    "based picture ( such as e.g.  @xcite ) , major causes of cib and csb are effects explicitly related to    * different proton and neutron masses .",
    "* electromagnetic effects ( mainly coulomb interaction ) . * mass splitting of isovector mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 and different coupling constants . *",
    "mass splitting between different @xmath11-isobar charge states .",
    "* unknown short distance effects which are usually described by models .",
    "traditionally it is believed that the difference between the charge and neutral pion mass in the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential accounts for a big part of cib while the difference between the masses of neutron and proton represents the most basic cause for csb .",
    "pion mass differences were shown to account for a @xmath12 of the @xmath7-@xmath6 scattering length difference  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon mass splitting also generates a difference in the kinetic energies .",
    "some recent obe models only consider the differences coming from nucleon mass splitting and kinematical effects  @xcite .",
    "however , these effects can only explain about a @xmath13 of the empirical csb . as a consequence some models leave csb unexplained  @xcite while others simply introduce a term _ ad hoc _ to explain the remaining contribution  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath14-exchange contributions , @xmath15 diagrams and other multi - meson exchanges including the @xmath11-isobar as intermediate states were considered to explain the empirical csb value accurately . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath14-exchange contributions with @xmath11 were found to be noticeable to explain the empirical cib value being @xmath16- and @xmath17-exchanges negligible .",
    "the difficulties arising in multi - meson exchange diagrams , in particular the energy dependence that they create , were avoided in the bonn potential  @xcite by introducing two effective scalar - isoscalar @xmath18-mesons simulating @xmath19 exchanges . in the highly successful cd - bonn potential",
    "@xcite csb was included at the simplest one - boson - exchange diagrams with the same philosophy as its predecessor  @xcite .",
    "many authors have also proposed the @xmath20 mixing as a key ingredient to understand csb  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath20 mixing is identified as the major source of csb while proton and nucleon mass differences are identified to produce a minor effect .",
    "it should be noted that such a calculation is hampered by the fact that the @xmath21 coupling constant occurring in the cs part is about @xmath22 larger than expected from @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and also from the actual value taken for the csb potential .",
    "fixed - s dispersion relations  @xcite yielded @xmath25 and vector meson dominance @xmath26 decays prefer @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 has been shown to be of some relevance as well  @xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity has been a major motivation to pursue experimental determinations of the neutron - neutron scattering length by indirect methods ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . a recent measurement of the nn scattering length using the pi - d capture reaction , yields ( see also @xcite for a review ) @xmath29 when corrected for magnetic interactions . the recent csb analysis of the reaction @xmath30",
    "@xcite uses also the large @xmath21 constant .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to approach the problem from a renormalization point of view . while we consider long distance physics to be _ known _ and describable by non - relativistic potentials we use a physical low energy parameter such as the scattering length to encode the unknown short distance physics . for the charge independent case",
    "it was shown how a natural @xmath23 value of @xmath21 could be confortably taken if a certain renormalization condition was imposed  @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss in much detail this poses a problem of finiteness in physical observables when connecting different channels such as @xmath31 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 ( strong or coulomb ) .",
    "we propose a short distance renormalization condition featuring charge independence which guarantees finiteness although an ambiguity arises .",
    "however , a natural choice of the renormalization condition works quite well when compared to measured or recommended values .",
    "while the traditional point of view outlined above tried to compute the scattering lengths , the effective field theory ( eft ) approach assumes that these scattering lengths are completely unrelated  @xcite .",
    "we pursue here the possible connection between them from a new perspective which actually is in - between , combining both points of view .",
    "we assume one scattering length to be known and exploit the concept of short distance insensitivity to determine all other scattering lengths and phase shifts from the requirement of finiteness of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : obe ] we motivate the use of renormalization without assuming previous knowledge from the reader as a useful preparatory material for further developments . in section",
    "[ sec : coulomb ] we extend the results to the interesting case of long range coulomb interactions as they appear in @xmath6 scattering .",
    "csb interactions are studied in all separate @xmath31,@xmath7,@xmath6 and @xmath8 cases in section  [ sec : csb ] where insightfull universal relations are found out . in section",
    "[ sec : sdc ] we propose a short distance connection where all the channels are correlated from the requirement of finiteness .",
    "a further interesting application has to do with the determination in appendix  [ sec : ppf ] of the gamow - teller matrix element needed in the pp fusion process from the np scattering length .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we come to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the main ideas behind renormalization in coordinate space for the obe potentials ( for a more detailed account see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) since they are focal in what follows . to provide a comprehensive perspective",
    "we compare it with the more traditional viewpoint of regulating the singular meson - exchange potentials by means of the introduction of short - distance form factors .",
    "the crucial distinction lies in the sensitivity to short - distance details : from the renormalization point of view we expect complete insensitivity to these details . on the contrary ,",
    "a regularization procedure only guarantees the finiteness of the results . for definiteness ,",
    "let us analyze as an illustrative example the phenomenologically successful @xmath32 one boson exchange ( obe ) potential  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a scalar type coupling , @xmath35 a pseudo - scalar coupling , @xmath21 is a vector coupling and @xmath36 is a tensor derivative coupling ( see @xcite for notation ) .",
    "we neglect for simplicity nucleon mass effects and a tiny @xmath37 contribution .",
    "we take @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 which seem firmly established .",
    "the obe potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential - obe ] ) corresponds to a long distance expansion of the potential . on the other hand ,",
    "nn scattering in the elastic region below pion production threshold involves cm momenta @xmath43 .",
    "given the fact that @xmath44 we expect heavier mesons to be irrelevant , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 themselves to be of marginal important .",
    "this naive expectation is , however , not fulfilled in the traditional approach  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will make the approximation @xmath47 , specially when making fits of the coupling parameters to the @xmath32 phases . under the previous approximation",
    "is convenient to define @xmath48 in such a way that the combined @xmath49 potential reads @xmath50 the previous simplification is useful since it avoids correlations between @xmath21 and @xmath36 in the @xmath32 channel . for su(3 )",
    "values of @xmath51 or vmd @xmath52 e.m . decays @xmath53 and typical @xmath10-tensor values @xmath54 one has @xmath55 .      in the traditional approach",
    "@xcite the problem is essentially handled by solving the reduced schrdinger equation , which for the @xmath1wave case reads @xmath56 with @xmath57 the center - of - mass momentum , @xmath58 the nucleon mass , and @xmath59 the boson - exchange potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential - obe ] ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation is a second order differential equation and it has two linearly independent solutions .",
    "the physical solution is usually determined by the regularity condition at the origin , i.e. @xmath60 this boundary condition for the schrdinger equation implicitly assumes that we are taking the potential seriously all the way down to the origin  .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the reduced wave function for @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the s - wave phase shift .",
    "for the potential described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential - obe ] ) , the phase shift is an analytic function of @xmath64 with branch cuts located at @xmath65 , @xmath66 , etc .",
    "this means in particular that for momenta below the first branch cut , @xmath67 , we can expand the phase shift by means of the effective range expansion  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the scattering length , @xmath70 the effective range and @xmath71 the shape parameter .",
    "the effective range parameters can be related with the expansion of the wave function in terms of @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 obey the following equations @xmath76 subjected to regular boundary conditions , @xmath77 , and asymptotically normalized to @xmath78 for @xmath79 . with this normalization , the effective range @xmath70 is computed from the standard formula @xmath80 \\label{eq : r0 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the traditional approach  @xcite _ everything _ is obtained from the potential , which is assumed to be valid for @xmath81 . in practice , strong form factors are included mimicking the finite nucleon size and reducing the short distance repulsion of the potential , but the regular boundary condition is always kept .",
    "one of the problems with this point of view has to do with the fact that the @xmath32 scattering length is unnaturally large @xmath82 , while the effective range is natural , @xmath83 ( approximately twice the pion compton wave length , @xmath84 ) .",
    "this has dramatic consequences regarding the short distance sensitivity , as we will show below .    [",

    "the previous zero energy wave functions can be written as @xmath89 these wave functions can be included in eq .",

    "our results are consistent with the expected smallness of the corrections . ]",
    "@xmath93 and by making use of the superposition principle , we can write @xmath94 so we get the bilinear relations between all scattering lengths @xmath95 etc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] we show the dependence of the scattering lengths as obtained from the @xmath31 scattering length and the previous correlations .",
    "as can be seen , the correlations work rather well , confirming the idea that finiteness is a good criterion to implement charge independence of short distance operators .",
    "numerical values are listed in table  [ tab : low_par ] for the experimental value of @xmath96 .",
    "it is interesting to see how the short distance connection works at finite energy and , in particular , if a given specific @xmath0 channel is able to predict the phase shifts for the remaining channels . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - shift_1s0 ] we plot the extracted @xmath7 and @xmath8 phase shifts when the obe parameters have been fixed from the @xmath32 nijmegen @xmath31 phase shifts .",
    "we have computed these phase shifts renormalizing in the @xmath31 channel , i.e. , fixing @xmath96 as input and integrating inward the schrdinger equation , and then using eq .",
    "we connect with the other channels .",
    "as we can see the short distance connection can be used to predict the @xmath32 phase shits for the rest of the channel with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the charge dependence and charge symmetry breaking of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we have used the obe model with exchange of @xmath9 , @xmath18 , @xmath46 and @xmath10 mesons and we have implemented csb by means of pion mass splitting in the ope potential and different nucleon masses . in particular , and as in previous works , we have selected the @xmath32 @xmath31 channel to fit scalar meson parameters , @xmath97 and @xmath34 , as well as vector meson couplings , @xmath21 and @xmath36 to the nijmegen phase shifts  @xcite .",
    "a fine tuning problem arises when we using the customary regular boundary condition at the origin @xmath98 .",
    "this problem appears in all @xmath31,@xmath7,@xmath6 and @xmath8 channels and large,@xmath99 , violations of @xmath23 values of the @xmath21 coupling constant are needed .",
    "traditionally a great amount of effects such as multi - meson exchanges have been essential to explain the differences in phase shifts and threshold parameters for all @xmath31,@xmath7,@xmath6 and @xmath8 channels  @xcite or the role played by @xmath20  @xcite and/or @xmath100  @xcite mixing were invoked .",
    "these standard approaches need very precise information on the interaction at all distances .    however , once we admit incomplete knowledge of the interaction at short distances , it is possible to sidestep the problem of fine tuning by imposing a renormalization condition ; at any stage of the calculation the scattering length is always kept fixed .",
    "this renormalization approach embodies short distance insensitivity . as a consequence , in the charge independent case",
    ", one can confortably take the experimental and/or su(3 ) values for vector meson couplings .",
    "for the same reason we can only hope to quantitatively describe the relative changes due to the charge symmetry breaking of the interaction at long distances .",
    "these considerations alone allow to extract some universal information on the symmetry breaking pattern where the @xmath31 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 channels look very much the same at all energies even though the potentials are different and are indeed csb .",
    "we have used a short distance condition to relate the renormalized @xmath31 channel with the others @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "this short distance connection is so far an assumption based on finiteness but we have seen that reasonable results are obtained for low energy parameters and phase shifts .",
    "our predictions for @xmath101 and @xmath102 are compatible with the empirical one within the error estimation .",
    "this is in fact a remarkable result : all channels are generated with _",
    "just one _ scattering length , say @xmath31 , and the long distance components of the potential where the csb is , via physical pion and nucleon masses , explicitly built in .",
    "our result is compatible with the interpretation that ( relative ) csb sits at large distances .",
    "the absolute csb is in a sense as uncertain as the short distance components of the nn force itself and can not be determined independently of the charge invariant interaction .",

    "we would like to analyze further consequences of the short distance connection assumed by eq .  .",
