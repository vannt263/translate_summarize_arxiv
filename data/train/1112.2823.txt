    "in order to elucidate the nature of antikaon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interaction in high density nuclear matter , it is an important subject to clarify whether the `` deeply - bound kaonic nucleus '' exists or not . in particular , the @xmath7_{i=1/2}$ ] , @xmath8 bound state , which is called `` @xmath9 '' here ,",
    "is suggested to be the lightest and most fundamental kaonic nucleus  @xcite . a new experimental search of @xmath9 via the @xmath10he(in - flight @xmath0 , @xmath11 )",
    "reaction has been planned at j - parc as e15 experiment  @xcite .",
    "we theoretically have discussed the expected inclusive and semi - exclusive spectra for the @xmath10he(in - flight @xmath0 , @xmath11 ) reaction within the framework of the distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) .",
    "we have employed a phenomenological single - channel @xmath0-``@xmath1 '' ( complex ) effective potential between the @xmath0 and the `` @xmath1''-core nucleus  @xcite , which has the form of @xmath12 ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are strength parameters in real and imaginary parts , respectively , and @xmath15 is the range parameter .",
    "@xmath16 is the phase space suppression factor of the @xmath5 decay modes  @xcite where @xmath17 is the energy measured from the @xmath9 threshold .    in the single - channel framework",
    ", we have shown that behavior of the @xmath10he(in - flight @xmath0 , @xmath11 ) spectrum can be understood in the `` moving pole '' picture  @xcite ; a pole of the @xmath9 bound state moves in the complex energy plane as a function of the energy @xmath17 on the real axis because the @xmath0-``@xmath1 '' effective potential is considerably energy - dependent .",
    "a trajectory of its moving pole governs the shape of the spectrum .",
    "thus , the validity of our calculations relies in part on whether the energy dependence of eq.([eq1 ] ) is appropriate near the @xmath4 decay threshold or not . to examine this subject ,",
    "we have extended the previous @xmath9 single channel description to the @xmath2-@xmath3 coupled - channel ( cc ) description because the energy dependence of eq.([eq1 ] ) should originate from eliminating the @xmath4 channel in such a cc scheme .    in this article , we investigate a single - channel @xmath0-``@xmath1 '' equivalent local potential which is derived from cc green s functions for @xmath18-@xmath3 systems , and evaluate the energy dependence of this effective potential to be compared with a phenomenological one  @xcite which is determined within eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the following cc green s function @xmath19 for @xmath18-@xmath3 systems ; @xmath20 \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } g^{(l)}_{11}(r , r ' ) & g^{(l)}_{12}(r , r ' )   \\\\ g^{(l)}_{21}(r , r ' ) & g^{(l)}_{22}(r , r ' )   \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] = \\delta(r'-r ) { \\mbox{1}\\hspace{-0.25em}\\mbox{l } } , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the channel 1 ( 2 ) refers to the @xmath0 and @xmath1-core system ( the @xmath21 and @xmath22-core system ) : @xmath23 denote the kinetic energies for 1 , 2 , and the energy @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 mev below the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the diagonal and coupling potentials , respectively . for simplicity , we assume an energy - independent gaussian form as @xmath30 =   \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } v_1 + i \\ , w_1 & v_{\\rm c } \\\\",
    "v_{\\rm c } & v_2 + i \\",
    ", w_2 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] \\exp[-(r / b)^2 ] ,   \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the strength parameters of the diagonal and coupling potentials , respectively , and @xmath33 describe effects of the other decay modes .",
    "these parameters in eq.([eq3 ] ) should be determined so as to reproduce the proper values of the binding energy and width which are obtained by single - channel calculations with @xmath34 in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "if we use cc green s functions in eq.([eq2 ] ) , we expect to confirm the previous results  @xcite for the @xmath35(in - flight @xmath0 , n ) spectrum within the dwia calculation .",
    "now we define the @xmath0-``@xmath1 '' equivalent local potential for channel 1 , @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( 1,1 ) component of a solution of eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "then , we get @xmath39 by multiplying the initial wave function @xmath40 as a bound state in channel 1 , and by integrating over @xmath41 , we obtain the expression of the equivalent local potential as @xmath42 which is defined under the boundary condition at _ every _",
    "@xmath17 on the physical axis , because green s functions can be calculated numerically at every points in the complex energy plane .",
    "this is the advantage that we used green s functions rather than wave functions .     for the @xmath0-``@xmath1 '' channel .",
    "potential parameters of eq.([eq3 ] ) are used as @xmath43 mev , @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 fm .",
    "the energy @xmath17 , which is measured from the @xmath9 threshold , is varied form @xmath48 mev to @xmath49 mev . ]",
    "figure 1 shows the calculated equivalent local potential @xmath36 with @xmath43 mev , @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 fm , in which the potential parameters are determined so that the binding energy and width of @xmath9 bound state are consistent with those calculated by yamazaki and akaishi  @xcite .",
    "we find that the strength of the imaginary part of @xmath36 becomes shallower as @xmath17 goes to @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior is approximately equivalent to that of the energy dependence obtained from the phase space factor in eq.([eq1 ] ) , whereas the shape of @xmath36 is not a gaussian function exactly .",
    "therefore , we estimate the potential strength of @xmath50 which is obtained with the help of the volume integrals ; @xmath51 \\ , r^2 dr}. \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] figure  2 shows values of @xmath52 as a function of the energy @xmath17 , together with the fitted curve of @xmath53 in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "the results are as follows :    * if no bound state exists in the @xmath3 channel ( @xmath54 mev ) , i m @xmath36 approximates to the phase space factor @xmath16 that is used in eq.([eq1 ] ) near the @xmath5 decay threshold . *",
    "if a bound state exists in the @xmath3 channel ( @xmath55 mev ) , the energy dependence of i m @xmath36 considerably differs from that of eq.([eq1 ] ) due to modification of the phase volume via a pole which is located near the @xmath56 threshold .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the energy dependence of the single - channel @xmath0-@xmath57 equivalent local potential @xmath36 derived from the @xmath2-@xmath3 model . it has turned out that the imaginary part of @xmath36 near the @xmath4 decay threshold can well approximate the phase space suppression factor of @xmath5 decay modes .",
    "if potential parameters in eq.([eq3 ] ) are replaced by the energy - dependent ones , as obtained from chiral @xmath6-@xmath58 dynamics @xcite , their energy dependence would additionally contribute to the effective potential .",
    "the further detailed investigation is now in progress .     of the @xmath0-@xmath59 equivalent local potential @xmath36 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines denote the cases with @xmath54 mev and @xmath60 mev in eq.([eq3 ] ) , respectively .",
