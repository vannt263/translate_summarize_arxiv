    "laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms plays important role for many directions of modern quantum physics .",
    "one of the directions is quantum metrology that experiences galloping progress nowadays .",
    "it is aimed on producing of standards of various physical quantities and on carrying out precise measurements with the help of them ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . at present",
    "the most precise measurements are possible for the physical quantities as frequency and time .",
    "it is due to success achieved in producing etalons ( standards ) for these quantities .",
    "contemporary time standard is based on a frequency standard , which defines its stability and accuracy to a considerable degree . at that",
    ", frequency etalons can be used not only as a basis for time standards , but also for conducting precise measurements of other physical quantities and constants as , for instance , electrical current and voltage , magnetic field , length , rydberg and fine - structure constants .",
    "high - accuracy experiments for versatile examination of relativistic and quantum theories have become feasible owing to modern frequency standards . among practical applications of time and frequency standards",
    "the broadband communication networks , navigational and global positioning systems should be mentioned especially .",
    "many laboratories in word - known scientific centers do research in the field of frequency standards .",
    "one of the latest trends in this field is connected with the concept of intercity or even international quantum clock network that could combine time etalons from various laboratories and countries into one system @xcite .",
    "there are two main directions of primary frequency standards development : the technology of a single ion confined in a electro - quadrupole trap and the second one based on many neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter direction is much newer than the former and it undergoes intense progress .",
    "the idea of neutral atoms trapping in a periodic light potential is not new and it was actively studied in 1970s ( see monograph @xcite and citations in it ) . as for metrological purposes this idea has experienced the second birth in the beginning of xxi century after noticeable progress in technique and methods of laser cooling of atoms , development of the `` magic''-wavelength concept @xcite , and also experimental and theoretical success in the field of spectroscopy of forbidden atomic transitions @xcite . at present , stability of optical - lattice - based frequency standards",
    "is on the same level with single - ion standards and in some cases even better .",
    "the state - of - the - art prototypes reached instability and uncertainty on the relative levels of @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "ones of the main candidates for producing the new - generation frequency standards are alkaline earth and alkaline - earth - like atoms : yb ( for instance , see @xcite ) , ca @xcite , sr @xcite , hg @xcite and mg @xcite .",
    "these atoms are the most appropriate because of narrow spectroscopic lines due to forbidden optical transitions from the ground state @xmath17s@xmath18 to the lowest excited triplet state @xmath19p@xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . moreover , one more key circumstance consists in the existence of so - called `` magic '' wavelength for these transitions . under the magic - wavelength optical field",
    "the linear ( in the intensity ) light shift is canceled .",
    "also , one of the last tendency in this field is connected with spectroscopy of transition @xmath17s@xmath18@xmath3@xmath19p@xmath18 in even isotopes ( with zero nucleus spin ) , which is highly forbidden .",
    "frequency of this transition is immune to many frequency - shift effects , therefore this transition can be exploited as a good `` clock '' transition . in spite of the transition is highly forbidden , it has already been observed by means of magnetic - field - induced spectroscopy @xcite in @xmath21yb @xcite , @xmath22sr @xcite and @xmath0 mg @xcite .    to date",
    ", atoms of the first four elements ( yb , ca , sr and hg ) can be effectively cooled by the laser methods down to ultralow temperatures , approaching to the recoil energy limit , what is required for effective loading an optical lattice ( @xmath23 110  @xmath13k ) . besides , sub - recoil temperatures can be obtained by using evaporative cooling technique , getting bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , researchers have not been able to reach the same great success with mg atoms .",
    "in particular , neither two - photon laser cooling @xcite nor laser quenching @xcite methods have appeared to be ineffective in the case with magnesium .",
    "the minimum temperature of a magnesium cloud that has been obtained by laser cooling method is about 500  @xmath13k , what is rather far from desirable range of values , in particular , from the recoil temperature ( 310  @xmath13k , depending on an atomic transition ) .    at the same time",
    ", magnesium atom has some advantages with respect to the other candidates for the frequency standard .",
    "thus , black - body radiation ( bbr ) shift is one of the main limiting factors for accuracy and stability of quantum frequency standard ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "bbr shift of the clock transition @xmath24s@xmath18@xmath3@xmath1p@xmath18 for magnesium is much smaller than for yb , ca , sr and just a little bit higher than for a mercury atom ( see tab.1 ) .",
    "however , from an experimental viewpoint mg has some advantages against hg .",
    "in particular , mercury atom requires noticeably smaller wavelengths for laser spectroscopy , cooling and trapping than mg .",
    "for instance , effective trapping of cold atoms in a nondissipative optical lattice and producing lamb - dicke regime need for an optical potential depth at the level of 50300 in the recoil energy units ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "it means that a highly intensive laser field at the magic wavelength @xmath25 should be applied .",
    "but , as it can be seen from table 1 , @xmath25(mg)@xmath26@xmath27  nm and @xmath25(hg)@xmath26@xmath28  nm .",
    "therefore , from an experimental viewpoint , producing deep optical potential for mercury atom is more difficult problem than for magnesium one due to the much smaller wavelength .",
    "besides of relatively small bbr shift , magnesium atom has one more advantage with respect to ca and sr .",
    "it consists in absence of optical pumping of atoms on the non - resonant level @xmath24d@xmath2 during the realization of laser precooling with the help of strong dipole transition @xmath24s@xmath18@xmath3@xmath24p@xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) to reach the temperature down to a few millikelvins @xcite .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .data for several atomic elements relevant for new - generation frequency standards : @xmath30 is a wavelength of the clock transition @xmath24s@xmath18@xmath3@xmath1p@xmath18 and @xmath25 is its magic wavelength , bbr frequency shifts are indicated with respect to absolute frequencies of clock transition ( @xmath30 is taken from nist atomic spectra database ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     recent experiments @xcite showed some progress in cooling of @xmath0 mg atoms .",
    "the atoms were cooled down to the record temperature equaled to 1.3  @xmath13k and confined in an optical lattice .",
    "however , the final number of atoms was of the order of @xmath31 , what was about 0.01% from the initial number of atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , involved the cyclic triplet dipole transition @xmath1p@xmath2@xmath3@xmath1d@xmath4 . that great loss in atomic number was due to the fact that velocity selection technique , having similarities with evaporative cooling , was used for reaching such ultralow temperature , but the laser cooling method in mot , unfortunately , showed the cloud temperature equaled to only about 1  mk .",
    "that result noticeably yielded to successful results with the other atomic elements ( ca , sr , yb , hg ) . at the same time",
    ", we believe that laser cooling strategy for magnesium atoms can be proper tuned for getting much better result of laser - cooling temperature as well as number of atoms trapped .    therefore , we can state that problem of deep cooling of magnesium atoms by means of laser radiation is still unsolved .",
    "moreover , increasing of ultracold atomic number has principal importance for many applications of cold atoms .",
    "for instance , authors of the paper @xcite managed to obtain bose - einstein condensation composed of @xmath23@xmath32 strontium atoms .",
    "besides , frequency - standard stability depends on an atomic number in an optical lattice and it increases with the number increases @xcite .",
    "all these things considered , we can conclude that it is important to solve the problem of deep laser cooling of magnesium atoms ( down to t@xmath23110  @xmath13k ) as well as to provide much larger number of ultracold atoms in a lattice .",
    "laser cooling of neutral atoms in a magneto - optical trap is one of the main cooling methods . at first time",
    "the laser field composed of six beams with orthogonal circular polarizations ( @xmath33 configuration ) was suggested in @xcite as effective way for simultaneous cooling and trapping of atoms .",
    "narrow spectral lines allow laser cooling of various atoms down to a few tens and units of microkelvin , and even lower .",
    "in particular , narrow intercombination transition @xmath34s@xmath18@xmath3@xmath35p@xmath29 in @xmath36ca ( @xmath37@xmath26@xmath38@xmath39@xmath40hz ) provides temperatures around 46  @xmath13k @xcite just by the help of doppler cooling process .",
    "there were good results with intercombination transitions also for the other elements : sr @xcite , yb @xcite and hg @xcite , for even as well as for odd isotopes .",
    "in certain aspects even isotopes , having a zero nuclear spin , are more attractive for frequency standards of new generation .",
    "however , as it has been already noted in the introduction , still there are not satisfactory results of cooling @xmath0 mg atoms by means of laser radiation in contrast to the other elements .    the first our attempt to solve the problem with deep laser cooling of magnesium was undertook in the recent work @xcite , where the detailed theoretical study of magnesium kinetics in 1d mot using the dipole transition @xmath1p@xmath2@xmath3@xmath1d@xmath4 was conducted .",
    "the theory was based on the semiclassical approach @xcite , based on the well - known assumptions :    @xmath41    and    @xmath42    here @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 is the recoil frequency , @xmath48 is mass of an atom , @xmath49@xmath44@xmath50@xmath51@xmath52 is wave number .",
    "the saturation parameter @xmath53 is defined as    @xmath54    where @xmath37 is the spontaneous relaxation rate of excited state , @xmath55@xmath44@xmath56@xmath15@xmath57 is the detuning of laser radiation frequency @xmath56 from the transition frequency @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the rabi frequency .    condition ( [ eq1 ] ) implies that recoil frequency must be rather small in comparison with a typical rate of establishment of steady state among atomic internal degrees of freedom . in particular , in the case of an atom without any degeneracy of the ground state this rate is defined by @xmath37 .",
    "if there is a degenerate ground state and optical pumping can occurs , this rate is defined by @xmath37 or the pumping rate @xmath37@xmath53 , depending on what is smaller . the second semiclassical requirement ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "implies that typical width of stationary linear momentum distribution @xmath59 must be much larger than the recoil momentum from emmision / absorption of a photon .",
    "doppler limit for temperature of laser cooling @xmath60 , which can be achieved at the frequency detuning @xmath55@xmath44@xmath61@xmath62 , can be figured out from equation for minimum kinetic energy in one - dimensional case :    @xmath63    strictly speaking , this equation is valid for transition @xmath64@xmath44@xmath65@xmath3@xmath66@xmath44@xmath67 .",
    "it was found in @xcite under @xmath7@xmath8 configuration ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "if we use this formula for getting estimate of @xmath60 in the case of transition @xmath1p@xmath2@xmath3@xmath1d@xmath4 ( @xmath37@xmath26@xmath38@xmath68mhz ) , we immediately find @xmath60@xmath69@xmath70@xmath13k . for effective trapping of atoms with such relatively high temperature the large intensity of cw optical lattice field at the level of tens of mw/@xmath71",
    "is required , what is hardly feasible in an experiment .",
    "therefore , much lower temperature of atomic cloud is needed . at the same time , since the transition considered has degenerate energy levels , one can anticipate activation of so - called sub - doppler mechanism during the laser cooling in mot under the polarization - gradient field . in principal",
    ", this process would overcome the doppler limit ( [ dopplerlimit ] ) and show much lower temperature than in the case of @xmath64@xmath44@xmath65@xmath3@xmath66@xmath44@xmath67 .",
    "semiclassical approach is based on kinetic equation of fokker - planck type on the wigner distribution function in phase space @xmath72 .",
    "that equation can be acquired by reducing of exact quantum kinetic equation on the density matrix in the series on small parameter @xmath73@xmath74@xmath75@xmath67 until second - order terms .",
    "this procedure is well - known and it has been done by many authors ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "eventually the following equation can be obtained :    @xmath76\\,f(z , p).\\ ] ]    here @xmath77 is laser - field force on an atom , @xmath78 is diffusion of an atom in the light field .",
    "this equation must be completed with normalizing condition that in one - dimensional periodic laser field has the form :    @xmath79    one - dimensional @xmath33 laser - field configuration allows significant simplifying of ( [ semiclassics ] ) , at that the dependence @xmath80 on @xmath81 vanishes ( see section [ firststage ] ) .",
    "our semiclassical calculations @xcite have been done beyond many widely used approximations ( for instance , slow atoms and weak field approximations ) .",
    "as it has been shown the minimum kinetic energy achievable in mot is close to 30@xmath39@xmath82 , where @xmath82@xmath44@xmath83 is the recoil energy . the effective temperature , which can be associated to this value , @xmath84@xmath26@xmath85@xmath12k .",
    "it is approximately three times lower than the estimate of doppler limit @xmath60@xmath26@xmath86@xmath12k , but , unfortunately , it is still very far from desirable range of values and , in particular , the recoil temperature @xmath87@xmath44@xmath88@xmath12k .",
    "let us consider a question on validity of semiclassical approach to the magnesium problem .",
    "indeed , as it will be shown further on the basis of semiclassical treatment , the optimal parameters of cooling field for transition @xmath1p@xmath2@xmath3@xmath1d@xmath4 can be chosen as @xmath55@xmath44@xmath89@xmath39@xmath90  mhz and @xmath91@xmath44@xmath92mw/@xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding saturation parameter @xmath53@xmath26@xmath93@xmath39@xmath94 . in spite of such low saturation ,",
    "the first semiclassical requirement ( [ eq1 ] ) is still satisfied , because @xmath43@xmath44@xmath50@xmath39@xmath95@xmath96 .",
    "at the same time , typical momentum distribution width @xmath97 may not satisfied the second semiclassical condition ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , in general case the distribution can have complex shape .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows two examples of momentum distributions for different values of light field intensity .",
    "the distribution acquires two - peaked profile at low intensity @xmath91@xmath44@xmath98mw/@xmath71 : there is the high - contrast spike on top of the wide background .",
    "this background conditionally describes `` hot '' fraction of atoms in a cloud with effective temperature @xmath84@xmath23@xmath99@xmath15@xmath100  mk , while the spike corresponds to ultracold fraction with @xmath84@xmath23@xmath101k .",
    "similar distributions were observed earlier ( e.g. , see @xcite with semiclassical low - saturation - limited calculations of sisyphus cooling of cs atoms with the help of transition @xmath102@xmath44@xmath93@xmath3@xmath103@xmath44@xmath88 or the quantum - treatment calculations for atomic w - type scheme in @xcite ) . in our case",
    "the narrow - spike width is about @xmath73 and the requirement @xmath97@xmath104@xmath73 is not satisfied at all . with increasing the intensity ( @xmath91@xmath44@xmath105mw/@xmath71 ) the two - peaked shape disappears .",
    "however , the distribution as a whole is still sufficiently narrow and the second requirement ( [ eq2 ] ) is satisfied with a good margin .",
    "also it should be noted that the condition ( [ eq2 ] ) , as a matter of fact , depends on the value of total angular momentum @xmath102 . in other words , at the same saturation parameter @xmath53 the requirement ( [ eq2 ] ) can be valid for small @xmath102 and getting not valid with its increasing .    basing on the aforesaid",
    ", we can conclude that more precise theoretical treatment is needed in the case with magnesium for adequate description of kinetics of ultracold atoms .",
    "this treatment can be based on the density matrix formalism with full account for the recoil effect ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . moreover , as it will be seen in the next section , the quantum - treatment results noticeably differs from the semiclassical ones , based on the equation ( [ semiclassics ] ) .",
    "that difference , in particular , gave us an idea for exploiting the second stage of sub - doppler laser cooling for getting the desirable results .",
    "let us consider the problem of laser cooling of magnesium atoms out of semiclassical approximation limit as well as some other widely used approximations ( weak - saturation limit , secular approximation , etc . ) .",
    "we assume the laser field to be one - dimensional , composed of two plane monochromatic counterpropagating light waves with equal frequencies and amplitudes ( the quantization axis @xmath81 is collinear to the wave vectors ) :    @xmath106    where @xmath107 are the unit complex vectors of waves polarizations , while @xmath108 is the following complex vector    @xmath109    nonzero components of the vectors @xmath107 in the spherical basis are    @xmath110    here @xmath111 are the ellipticity parameters ( in particular , @xmath112@xmath44@xmath113 corresponds ro righ- or left - circular polarized wave , @xmath112@xmath44@xmath65 is for linear polarization ) , @xmath114 is the angle between main axes of polarization ellipses .",
    "for instance , the case with @xmath111@xmath44@xmath65 and @xmath114@xmath44@xmath115 corresponds to _ lin_@xmath9_lin _ field configuration .    here",
    "quantum treatment of atomic kinetics under the laser field ( [ field ] ) is based on the equation on single - atom density matrix in coordinate two - point representation that has the form ( e.g. , see @xcite ) :    @xmath116+\\widehat{\\gamma}\\bigl\\{\\widehat{\\rho}\\bigr\\},\\ ] ]    with the hamiltonian    @xmath117    the first term in the hamiltonian is the operator of kinetic energy of an atom ( @xmath118 is the linear momentum operator ) , @xmath119 describes intratomic degrees of freedom , operator @xmath120 corresponds to the atom - field dipole interaction , and the linear operator functional @xmath121@xmath122 is respective for relaxation processes in an atom .",
    "let us introduce the projection operator onto the excited atom state :    @xmath123    and the wigner vector operator @xmath124 , whose spherical components are :    @xmath125    with @xmath126@xmath44@xmath127 and @xmath128 the clebsch - gordan coefficients ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "then the terms @xmath119 and @xmath120 from ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the resonant approximation can be written as    @xmath129    and    @xmath130    here @xmath58@xmath44@xmath131 is the rabi frequency ( with @xmath132 the reduced matrix element of dipole operator of an atom ) , @xmath133@xmath44@xmath124@xmath134@xmath135 is the dimensionless operator of atom - field interaction , depending on the coordinate in general case , @xmath136 means hermitian - conjugate term .    introduce the new coordinates :    @xmath137    in which the spontaneous relaxation operator from ( [ density1 ] ) acquires the form :    @xmath138    with    @xmath139    note that in the absence of recoil effect , i.e. in the limit @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 .",
    "the density matrix can be divided into four matrix blocks :    @xmath142    matrix blocks @xmath143 and @xmath144 describes populations of the ground and the excited states as well as low - frequency ( zeeman ) coherences .",
    "blocks @xmath145 and @xmath146 are responsible for optical coherences . for the new coordinates ( [ coordinates ] ) and using all introduced notations the new equations on the density matrix blocks can be easily acquired from ( [ density1 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig4]b shows number of atoms in the ultracold fraction @xmath199 as the function of light field intensity @xmath91 . as it is seen from the figure there is a maximum in vicinity of 500  mw/@xmath71 .",
    "it should be noted that position of this optimum is not immediately the same as for the minimum of the dependence @xmath200 .",
    "figure  [ fig4]b demonstrates that about 40  % of atoms can be concentrated in the ultracold fraction . for comparison analogical dependence is presented , calculated on the basis of semiclassical approach ( dashed line ) , which lies noticeably higher than the former one .",
    "the dependencies @xmath200 and @xmath201 lose to the semiclassical ones , because quantum treatment provides significantly different result for the momentum distribution in the vicinity of @xmath195@xmath26@xmath65 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows very sharp spike in the semiclassical case and a tiny peak as the result of quantum calculations .",
    "fortunately , solution of the problem of deep laser cooling of magnesium atoms can be found by involving the second stage of sub - doppler cooling with the help of one - dimensional optical molasses .",
    "the molasses is composed of two counterpropagating light waves with orthogonal linear polarizations ( _ lin_@xmath9_lin _ configuration ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath7@xmath8 configuration , in the case of _ lin_@xmath9_lin _ field the total - field polarization transforms from linear to circular ( and back ) along z - axis ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , there is no any rotating transformation of coordinate frame @xmath164 that would make density matrix independent of @xmath81-coordinate .",
    "therefore , we must solve the set of equations ( [ densityblocks])-([densityblocks4 ] ) on matrix @xmath202 .",
    "we have solved the equation numerically on the basis of matrix continued fractions method .",
    "the details of the method can be found , for example , in @xcite and we do not reproduce it here . instead of that , we just present the numerical results .",
    "figure  [ fig6]a demonstrates much lower minimum kinetic energy than in the case of @xmath7@xmath8 field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , solid line ) .",
    "in particular , the minimum corresponds to @xmath203@xmath26@xmath204@xmath82 at @xmath91@xmath26@xmath205  mw/@xmath71 ( @xmath84@xmath26@xmath206@xmath13k ) .",
    "besides , as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , ultracold fraction of atoms under _ lin_@xmath9_lin _",
    "light field can be higher than in the case of @xmath7@xmath8 ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "narrow structure in momentum profile in vicinity of @xmath195@xmath26@xmath207 becomes more visible than under @xmath7@xmath8 field ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the second cooling stage involving optical molasses can provide lower temperature as well as larger number of atoms in ultracold fraction ( up to 60% ) .",
    "after the second sub - doppler cooling stage atoms may be loaded , for instance , to a dipole trap . at that the `` hot '' fraction of atoms ( wide background at fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) can be evaporated by proper choice of the light potential depth , saving only the ultracold fraction in a trap ( with effective temperature @xmath208@xmath12k ) .",
    "it should be noted that realization of the second sub - doppler stage should eventually provide much more number of ultracold atoms in a dipole trap ( or an optical lattice ) after evaporation than without this stage .",
    "in conclusion we would like to summarize main results of the work . we have suggested using the second sub - doppler cooling stage to solve the problem of deep laser cooling of magnesium atoms .",
    "the first stage implies using of magneto - optical trap involving dipole transition between triplet states @xmath1p@xmath2 and @xmath1d@xmath4 .",
    "in particular , this stage was used in the experiment of researches from hannover university @xcite . in spite of",
    "that the level @xmath1p@xmath2 is degenerate and one could anticipate activation of effective sub - doppler mechanism of cooling in polarization - gradient field @xcite , however , the conducted theoretical analysis has figured out the minimum temperature at the level of 310  @xmath13k , what is just a little bit lower than the estimate for doppler limit of cooling ( @xmath60@xmath69@xmath70@xmath13k ) . to reduce this value by several times",
    "we have proposed using the second laser - cooling stage with the help of optical molasses composed of two counterpropagating orthogonally linearly polarized waves ( _ lin_@xmath9_lin _ field configuration ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath7@xmath8 field , applied in mot , the optical molasses demonstrates much lower temperature ( 80  @xmath209 ) . at the same time , the minimum achievable temperature of laser cooling in the case of @xmath0 mg still is noticeably higher than for some other atoms , where sub - doppler mechanism provides much better results .",
    "most likely , it is due to relatively large recoil energy of magnesium atom .",
    "for instance , for considered transition in magnesium recoil frequency @xmath43@xmath69@xmath38@xmath39@xmath210khz , while for @xmath211cs ( @xmath212s@xmath213 , f=4 @xmath3 @xmath212p@xmath214 , f=5 ) this frequency is significantly smaller ( @xmath43@xmath69@xmath38@xmath39@xmath215khz ) , what allowed cooling cesium atoms down to 2.5  @xmath13k @xcite .    besides temperature ( average kinetic energy ) of ensemble of atoms",
    "we have also paid attention to the linear momentum distributions in the steady state . in particular , we have investigated the problem of increasing concentration of atoms in ultracold fraction ( a region in momentum space in the vicinity of @xmath195@xmath44@xmath65 ) .",
    "conducted numerical calculations have revealed the optimum parameters of laser field for maximization of the ultracold fraction ( @xmath84@xmath231  @xmath13k ) .",
    "this fraction can be easily localized in a optical trap , while the other fraction ( `` hot '' atoms ) can be evaporated from the trap by proper choice of the optical depth . at that",
    ", it is the second stage of sub - doppler cooling that can provide great increase of ultracold atomic number in comparison with the case with only the first stage realized ( as in the experiments @xcite ) .    in our theoretical analysis quantum treatment with full account for the recoil effect",
    "has been exploited , i.e. we have not been limited by semiclassical or secular approximations as well as weak - field limit .",
    "it has allowed us studying kinetics of cold magnesium in a wide range of intensity and frequency detuning to determine the optimum parameters of laser field . also we have compared data provided by quantum and semiclassical approaches . as the result of that comparison",
    "we can conclude that semiclassical approach in the case of transition @xmath1p@xmath2@xmath3@xmath1d@xmath4 in @xmath0 mg is not valid for adequate understanding the kinetics of ultracold magnesium atoms for a wide range of light - field parameters .",
    "moreover , we can also conclude that for getting the adequate estimate of cooling parameters and understanding the problems in deep laser cooling of atoms it is quite necessary to treat the problems with the help of quantum approach .    at the end",
    "we should note that in spite of theoretical analysis has been done out of many widely used approximations , we have assumed the problem to be one - dimensional .",
    "however , light - field configuration used in a magneto - optical trap is always three - dimensional ( three pairs of circularly polarized beams ) .",
    "therefore , obviously , the results of such 1d analysis may differ from the real experiment with 3d field .",
    "for example , one can refer to the papers @xcite for getting the estimate of such kind of difference . in these papers calculations",
    "were done for 1d and 3d configurations by the example of simple transition @xmath102@xmath44@xmath65@xmath3@xmath103@xmath44@xmath67 in limits of semiclassical and slow - atoms approximations . at the same time , an optical molasses ( the second cooling stage suggested ) , which is of the most interest from the viewpoint of deep laser cooling , can be implemented in 3d as well as in 1d configuration .",
    "three - dimensional optical molasses for various transition of the type @xmath102@xmath44@xmath216@xmath3@xmath103@xmath44@xmath216@xmath170@xmath67 was investigated in ref . @xcite under weak - saturation approximation and with the help of adiabatic reduction of density matrix equations to ground state .",
    "unfortunately that approximation gives good results not for wide range of parameters @xmath55 and @xmath91 that can have an interest from the laser cooling view of point ( e.g. , see the work @xcite , where results of adiabatic approximation were compared with results of full quantum treatment ) .",
    "three - dimensional quantum treatment with full account for the recoil effect and beyond the aforesaid approximations is quite difficult task that requires separate study .",
