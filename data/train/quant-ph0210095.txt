    "these two moves indeed completely remove the non - uniqueness .",
    "so the construction of polynomial invariants for knots must be such that the polynomial does not change under markov moves .",

    "further , we introduce a correction factor to the braid eigenvalues obtained from six - vertex model such that the polynomial does not change under markov moves i and ii .",
    "the correction factor on braiding eigenvalues depends on the relative orientations between the two strands . for right - handed half - twists between strands of parallel orientation ,",
    "the braiding eigenvalues @xmath51 are @xmath52 similarly , for right - handed half twists between strands of antiparallel orientation , the braiding eigenvalues @xmath53 are @xmath54 the eigenvalues for left - handed half - twists are inverse of the right - handed half - twists eigenvalues .",
    "suppose we consider any knot obtained from capping of a @xmath0-strand oriented braid . clearly , capping is possible if the number of outgoing strands is equal the number of incoming strands in the oriented braid .",
    "in other words , the quantum states @xmath55 s on the strands ( [ nev ] ) should be such that @xmath56 therefore to study knots from braids , only the subspace of the states @xmath57 satisfying eq .",

    "hence the construction of the eigenstates of braiding operators should be consistent with eq .",
    "( [ zer ] ) .",
    "we will now present the eigenstates of the braiding matrices which will enable direct evaluation of knot polynomials . for a @xmath0-strand oriented braid , we can write the most general eigenbasis of braiding operators @xmath50 with eigenvalue @xmath58 , for all @xmath59 s , as : @xmath60 recall that the appropriate braiding eigenvalues ( [ para],[antip ] ) need to be substituted depending on the relative orientations of the two strands involved in braiding and the handedness .",

    ".      consider any knot or link as shown in fig .  1 which is technically called platting or capping of braids .",
    "the knot type is determined by the braiding region denoted as the shaded region in fig .",
    "1 . it involves a sequence of braiding operations which is usually written as a braid word with appropriate orientations . taking the initial state and final state as @xmath74",
    ", the following matrix element @xmath75 gives the jones polynomial ( up to an overall normalisation ) .",
