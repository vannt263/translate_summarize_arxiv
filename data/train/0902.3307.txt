    "the growth history of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galactic centers is a key question for understanding cosmic history .",
    "this can be traced by observations of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , where mass accretion onto smbhs is taking place .",
    "many observations indicate that obscured agns are the major agn population both in the local universe and at intermediate - to - high redshifts ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , much of the smbh growth is theoretically expected to happen during an obscured phase in the evolution of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , detecting all the obscured agns in the universe and revealing their nature is a fundamental issue to be addressed by modern astrophysics .",
    "our knowledge of this population is still quite limited even in the local universe , due the difficulty of detecting highly absorbed objects in most wavelength bands .",

    "sensitive hard x - ray observations above 10 kev provide us with the least biased agn samples in the local universe , due to the strong penetrating power against photo - electric absorption , except for heavily compton thick ( column density of log @xmath13  @xmath14 24.5 @xmath1 ) objects .",

    "we firstly analyze only the bat spectra in the 15200 kev band to constrain the high energy cutoff in the continuum .",
    "it is known that the incident photon spectra of seyfert galaxies are well approximated by a power law with an exponential cutoff ( cutoff power law model ) , represented as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the normalization at 1 kev , photon index , cutoff energy , respectively .",
    "here we utilize the ` pexrav ` code by @xcite to take into account possible contribution of the compton reflection component from optically thick , cold matter .",
    "the relative intensity of the reflection component to that of the incident cutoff power law component is defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath4 is the solid angle of the reflector ( @xmath56 corresponds to the reflection from a semi - infinite plane ) .    in this stage , we assume @xmath57 = 0 or 2 as the two extreme cases just to evaluate the effects of the reflection .",
    "the inclination angle is fixed at @xmath58 . to avoid strong coupling between the power law slope and and cutoff energy",
    ", we fix the photon index at 1.9 , which is a canonical value for agns .",
    "table  [ tab - ecut ] summarizes the fitting results of the cutoff energy for each target .",
    "while it is difficult to constrain its upper limit due to the limited band coverage of the bat , we find the cutoff energy must be above @xmath49100 kev in most cases . considering this limitation ,",
    "we fix @xmath54 at 300 kev in all subsequent analysis .",
    "impacts by adopting a lower value of @xmath59 in the spectral fitting are discussed in   [ sec - results - summary ] .",
    "we consider three basic models in the spectral analysis uniformly for all the six targets .",
    "our policy is to start with the simplest model for each target ; if we find that the fit with a simple model does not give a physically self - consistent picture and/or that the fit is significantly improved by introducing additional parameters , then we adopt more complicated models . in all the cases , we assume a power law with an exponential cutoff fixed at 300 kev for the incident continuum , as explained in the previous subsection .",
    "the galactic absorption , @xmath60 , is always included in the model ( even if not explicitly mentioned below ) by assuming the hydrogen column density from the h  i map of @xcite , available with the _ nh _ program in the _ heasoft _ package . for absorption , we adopt the photo - electric absorption cross section by @xcite ( `` bcmc '' ) and use the ` phabs ` or ` zphabs ` model in xspec .",
    "solar abundances by @xcite are assumed throughout the analysis .",
    "the first ( simplest ) model , designated as model  a , consists of ( i ) a transmitted component ( a cut - off power law absorbed by cold matter ) , ( ii ) a scattered component ( a cut - off power law without absorption ) , and ( iii ) an iron - k emission line ( a gaussian ) , represented as ` zphabs*zhighect*zpowerlw + const*zhighect*zpowerlw + zgauss ` in the xspec terminology . according to the unified scheme , in type",
    "2 agns , the incident power law from the nucleus will be absorbed by a dusty torus around the smbh , while the nuclear emission is partially scattered into the line - of - sight by ionized gas around the torus .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the scattered component has the same shape of the incident power law with a fraction of @xmath61 as first - order approximation , although , in reality , it often contains a number of recombination lines produced by a photo - ionized plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) unless the scatterer is fully ionized . as a result of reprocessing by cold matter in the surrounding environment ( such as a torus , an ionized gas , and an accretion disk ) ,",
    "an iron - k emission will be produced at the rest - frame 6.4 kev . since a line from the torus",
    "should not resolved by the energy resolution of the xis , we fix the @xmath48 line width of the iron - k line at the averaged value of the ( apparent ) line width of the @xmath62 calibration source at 5.9 kev : 0.3 ev , 38 ev , 30 ev , 0.8 ev , 1.7 ev and 3.2 ev for swift j0138.64001 , j0255.20011 , j0350.15019 , j0505.72348 , j0601.98636 , and j1628.15145 , respectively , to take into account a possible systematic error in the energy response .    in the second model , model  b",
    ", we consider an additional contribution of an absorbed compton reflection component from optically thick matter .",

    "model  b is expressed as ` zphabs*zhighect*zpowerlw + const*zhighect*zpowerlw + zgauss + zphabs*pexrav ` in the xspec terminology , where the last term represents the reflection component ( not including the direct one ) . in the ` pexrav ` model , we make the solid angle @xmath4 of the reflector seen from the nucleus as a free parameter , and fix the inclination angle and the cutoff energy at @xmath58 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the photon index and normalization of the power law are linked to those of the transmitted component .",
    "the absorption to the reflection component is set to be independent of that for the transmitted one , by considering a different geometry of the emission region . to check the physical validity of model  b",
    ", we examine the equivalent width ( e.w . ) of the iron - k emission line with respect to the reflection component , @xmath64 , obtained from the fit .",
    "theoretically , it is expected to be 12 kev @xcite .",
    "this value , however , tightly depends on the geometries of the torus and the accretion disk .",
    "thus , we regard the result of model  b as valid only if @xmath65 but discard it otherwise .",
    "we finally consider the third model ( model  c ) , where we assume two different absorptions with different covering factors for the transmitted component .",
    "this reduces the contribution of a less absorbed reflection component compared with the case of a single absorption as assumed in model  b. in fact , simulations show that the absorber in the torus can be patchy @xcite , resulting in a time - averaged spectrum that is better modeled by multiple absorptions to the transmitted continuum rather than by a single absorber . in the xspec terminology ,",
    "model  c is expressed as ` zphabs*zpcfabs*zhighect*zpowerlw + const*zhighect*zpowerlw + zgauss + zphabs*pexrav ` , where the multiple terms of the first component ( absorbed , partial covering model ) represents the two different absorptions .    to summarize , we can write the three models of the photon spectrum @xmath66 without the galactic absorption as follows : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fraction of the more heavily absorbed component ( @xmath69 in models a and b ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the absorption column densities for the transmitted component ( @xmath72 in models a and b )",

    "( 1 ) first , if models  b is found to significantly improve the fit from model  a by performing an f - test , we tentatively adopt model  b as a better model , otherwise model  a. ( 2 ) then , if model  b is found to be physically _ not _ self - consistent in terms of the e.w . of the iron - k line as",
    "explained in the previous subsection , or if model  c significantly improves the fit compared with model a , we adopt model  c as the best model .    after finding the best one among the three models",
    ", we finally include the _ swift_/bat spectrum to the _ suzaku _  data to constrain the photon index most tightly , assuming that the spectral variability is negligible between the observation epoch of _ suzaku _  and that of _ swift_. in the fit , we fix the relative normalization between the fi - xiss and the pin at 1.1 based on the calibration of crab nebula @xcite , while those of the bi - xis and the bat against fi - xiss are treated as free parameters , considering the calibration uncertainty and time variability ( in flux ) , respectively .",
    "the detailed results of spectral fit for each source is summarized below .",
    "we adopt model b as the most appropriate model of swift j0138.64001 .",
    "we obtain @xmath80 = @xmath81 with model a and @xmath82 with model  b , where @xmath83 is the degree of freedom .",
    "thus , the improvement of the fit by adding a reflection component is found to be significant at @xmath8490% confidence level by an @xmath85-test , which gives an @xmath85-value of 4.38 for the degrees of freedom of @xmath86 . since the e.w . of the iron - k line with respect to the reflection component",
    "is found to be @xmath87 0.5 kev , the model is physically self - consistent .",
    "here we allow the absorption to the reflection component @xmath88 to be a free parameter , unlike the case in @xcite , where it is linked to that for the transmitted component .",

    "we also confirm that applying model  c does not improve the fit significantly , yielding @xmath93 ( i.e. , multiple absorbers for the transmitted component are not required when we consider a reflection component ) .",

    "we obtain @xmath80 = @xmath98 with model a , and @xmath99 with model b. here , we link the absorption to the reflection component and that to the transmitted one , as having the former as a free parameter does not help improving the fit .",
    "model  c gives @xmath80 = @xmath99 and @xmath100 kev , which is now physically consistent .",
    "we adopt model  c with a line feature at @xmath490.9 kev as the best description for swift j0505.72348 .",
    "we find very little reflection component in the spectra of swift j0505.72348 ; models  a and b give a very similar @xmath101 value of 671.3 for a degree of freedom of 602 and 600 , respectively , with no improvement of the fit by model b. in fact , we obtain a tight upper limit for the reflection component of @xmath102 ( 90% confidence level ) from the fit with model  b. thus , we apply model  c ( here @xmath88 is tied to @xmath103 since @xmath104 ) .",

    "we find that swift j0350.15019  shows a smaller scattered fraction ( @xmath126% ) compared with the case of @xmath54= 300 kev . for swift j1628.15145",
    ", we also obtain a slightly smaller scattered fraction ( @xmath127 ) with stronger reflection ( @xmath128 ) and larger absorption ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the other parameters , including those of swift j0601.98636 , do not change within the 90% errors .",
    "these results indicate that coupling of the spectral parameters with @xmath130 could not always be negligible .",
    "nevertheless , we confirm that it does not affect our discussion below , even considering the largest uncertainties as estimated here .",
    "we have for the first time obtained broad - band spectra covering the 0.550 kev band of the six `` new '' agns detected in the _",
    "swift_/bat survey that did not have precise x - ray observations , including the two sources already reported by @xcite .",
    "these six targets were essentially selected without biases , and hence can be regarded as a representative sample of new _",
    "swift_/bat agns .",
    "the spectra of all the targets are uniformly described with a spectral model consisting of a heavily absorbed ( log @xmath131 @xmath1 ) transmitted components with a single or multiple absorptions , scattered lights , a compton reflection component from optically - thick cold matter , and an iron - k emission line at 6.4 kev in the rest - frame , with additional soft x - ray components in two cases . thanks to its good sensitivity in the 1050 kev band and simultaneous band coverage with _",
    "suzaku _ , we have accurately derived key spectral parameters including the fraction of the scattered component @xmath61 , the strength of the reflection component @xmath132 , and the e.w . of the iron - k emission line .",
    "the first notable result is that our sample show very small values of @xmath75 , @xmath133 , compared with a typical value of optical selected seyfert-2 samples of 310% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite categorize agns with @xmath134 as `` hidden '' agns , to which all the six sources belong .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the `` hidden '' agns constitutes a significant fraction ( 24% ) of the uniform _",
    "swift_/bat sample .",
    "figure  [ fig - r_vs_fscat ] shows the correlation between the reflection strength @xmath57 versus scattering fraction @xmath75 for our sample .",
    "this plot suggests that there are two groups even within the `` hidden '' population defined by @xcite , that is ,      although it is hard to conclude if this distribution is really distinct or continuous , given the small number of the current sample .",
    "following the description by @xcite , we refer to the former group as `` new type '' and the other `` classical type '' .",
    "the new group includes the two sources of @xcite , swift j0138.64001  and swift j0601.98636 , and swift j0255.20011 .",
    "the extremely small scattering fraction indicates two possibilities ( 1 ) the opening angle of the torus is small and/or ( 2 ) there is very little gas around the torus to scatter the x - rays .",
    "although it is difficult to firmly exclude the latter possibility , the global presence of a reflection component strongly supports the former , as discussed below .",
    "we can constrain the geometry of the torus and viewing angles from the spectral parameters , the scattering fraction , the e.w . of the iron - k line , and absorption column density , based on a simple torus model . here",
    "we utilize the calculation by @xcite , where three free parameters are introduced for a uniform - density torus whose cross - section has a square shape ; the thickness of the torus in terms of the optical depth for thomson scattering @xmath138 , the half - opening angle of torus @xmath139 , and the inclination angle @xmath140 . in this geometry ,",
    "the line - of - sight column density of the torus depends on @xmath140 ; when we see the nucleus with face - on view , the absorption becomes much smaller than the case of edge - on view .",
    "if the column density of the scatterer is constant , the opening angle can be connected to the scattering fraction as @xmath141 where we normalize @xmath142 at @xmath143 .",
    "assuming @xmath144 at @xmath145 as typical parameters , corresponds to the number ratio of obscured agns to unobscured ones of about 3 , which is consistent with the observations of local agns .",
    "] we obtain @xmath146 for the new type group .",
    "then , comparing with figure  2 of @xcite where @xmath147 is assumed , we can constrain @xmath148 for swift j0601.98636 , and @xmath149 for swift j0138.64001  and swift j0255.20011 , from the observed e.w . of the iron - k line ( here we have neglected the contribution of an iron - k line originating from the accretion disk , which is often broader than the `` narrow '' one considered in the spectral model . ) .",
    "the absorption column densities @xmath150 @xmath151 and strong reflection @xmath152 are fully consistent with the geometry considered here .",
    "the reflection continuum is attributable to that from the inner wall of the tall torus and that from the accretion disk seen with a small inclination angle .",
    "thus , it is very likely that we are seeing the new type agns in a rather face - on geometry through a geometrically and optically thick torus , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this interpretation is that , if we view the same objects in a more edge - on geometry , then these agns look heavily compton - thick ( @xmath153 @xmath1 ) and hence the transmitted components hardly escape toward us even in the hard x - ray @xmath154 kev regime due to repeated scattering .",
    "thus , simliar systems to new type agns discovered here may still be largely missed even in the on - going _",
    "swift_/bat or _ integral _  surveys , requiring even more sensitive observations in hard x - rays to detect them more completely .    for the classical type of agns",
    ", we obtain @xmath155 from the observed scattered fraction by equation ( [ eq - theta ] ) .",
    "two sources in this group , swift j0505.72348  and swift j1628.15145 , show weak e.w . of the iron - k emission line , @xmath156 kev .",
    "this is hard to explain by a torus with large @xmath138 as assumed in figure  2 of @xcite , which predicts e.w .",
    "@xmath157 kev if @xmath158 ( i.e. , the transmitted component is absorbed ) . to consider a torus with different optical depths , we apply a model developed by @xcite",
    "( see their figure  1 for the definition of the geometry ) .",
    "we find that the e.w of the iron - k line and absorption can be consistently explained , within a factor of 2 , if the column density of the torus in the equatorial plane is @xmath159 @xmath1 and @xmath160 .",
    "the absence of strong reflection components is also consistent with the small optical depth of the torus and with the `` edge - on '' accretion disk .    to summarize",
    ", we have discovered from our first _",
    "swift_-_suzaku _",
    "agn sample two different classes of obscured agn population , called `` new type '' that have an extremely small scattering fraction ( @xmath161 ) and a strong reflection component ( @xmath135 ) , and `` classical type '' with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "figure  [ fig - torus ] shows a schematic illustration of the torus geometry of the two types .",
    "it is likely that the new type agns are deeply buried in an optically thick torus ( @xmath164 @xmath1 ) with a small opening angle @xmath165 , and are viewed in a face - on geometry .",
    "by contrast , the classical type agns have an optically thin torus ( @xmath9 @xmath1 ) with a larger opening angle @xmath166 viewed in a more edge - on geometry than the new type . a significant number of new type agns with an edge - on view from us may still be missing in the current all - sky hard x - ray surveys .",
    "the presence of two classes of obscured agns implies that the understanding of agn is not as simple as assumed in the population synthesis models of the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "given the small number of our sample , however , it is not clear whether there are two `` distinct '' types of obscured agns or the distribution is continuous .",
    "more systematic follow - up observations with _ suzaku _  of new _",
    "swift_/bat agns are important to establish the true properties of local agns .",
