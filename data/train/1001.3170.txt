    "the structure consists of a mass measuring 12.5@xmath360.0@xmath31.5 @xmath2m@xmath1 , which is suspended by a 3 @xmath2 m wide spring beam and a 280 nm narrow engine beam .",
    "both beams have a length of 800 nm . before discussing the stand - alone operation of the heat engine , its in - plane mechanical resonance at 1.26 mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) is characterized by actuating it via terminal t3 with an ac electrostatic force and detecting the strain variations in the engine beam using the piezoresistive effect ( see methods ) . to operate the device as a piezoresistive heat engine ,",
    "the external ac actuation voltage is disconnected from terminal t3 .",
    "thus , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the device is only connected at terminal t1 to a dc current source @xmath5 and to a capacitively coupled oscilloscope .",
    "all other terminals are grounded . at low values of @xmath5 only noise is observed on the oscilloscope .",
    "however , if the dc current is increased above a threshold @xmath6=1.19 ma a remarkable effect occurs : the device spontaneously starts to oscillate and generates a sinusoidal output voltage @xmath7 with a frequency of 1.26 mhz .",
    "oscilloscope and spectrum analyser measurements of the signal are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , [ fig2]c and [ fig2]d . the motion of the device is also studied by stroboscopic illumination under a microscope .",

    "stroboscopic and electrical measurements show that just above @xmath6 the displacement amplitude of the mass depends very sensitively on the dc current @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is increased more than 50 @xmath2a above @xmath6 , the optically observed mechanical amplitude @xmath8 stops increasing and is saturated by collisions of the resonator mass against electrode t3 .",
    "this amplitude saturation is also observed in the piezoresistance variations @xmath9 .",
    "the observed oscillation of the heat engine is attributed to the thermodynamic feedback mechanism which is schematically shown in fig . [ fig1]d . when an alternating mechanical displacement @xmath10 with frequency @xmath11 is applied to a piezoresistive beam with spring constant @xmath12",
    ", this will not just result in an elastic force , but will also result in a resistance variation @xmath9 via the piezoresistive effect .",
    "if a constant dc current @xmath5 is flowing through the spring , the resistive heating power therefore changes by @xmath13 and causes a temperature change , which in turn will generate a thermal expansion force @xmath14 that adds to the external forces @xmath15 on the spring , such that @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude and the thermal phase - delay of the thermal expansion feedback force @xmath14 can be described by a complex coefficient @xmath17 which is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 can be calculated from the material constants and geometry of the spring ( see supplementary discussion a ) . the response of the piezoresistive spring to an external force can now be described by a complex spring constant @xmath19 .",
    "when the piezoresistive spring is coupled to a mass @xmath20 , it forms a resonator that can store energy @xmath21 similar to the flywheel of a conventional heat engine . in the absence of current ( @xmath22 a ) , the resonator s intrinsic damping",
    "can be expressed by a @xmath23-factor @xmath24 and its resonance frequency is given by @xmath25 .",
    "in the small - signal approximation , the linearised equation of motion of the heat engine driven resonator is equivalent to the well - known harmonic oscillator : @xmath26 . for a sinusoidal motion @xmath10 near the resonance frequency @xmath27",
    "the imaginary ( damping ) part of this equation becomes zero at a threshold current value @xmath28 . above this dc current @xmath29 the power generated by the heat engine beam exceeds the intrinsic losses and the resonator will be brought into sustained oscillation by the engine beam .",
    "the heat capacitance of the beam results in a thermal delay between piezoresistive heating power and temperature in the engine beam . as a consequence ,",
    "the beam expands at a higher beam temperature @xmath30 than at which it contracts .",
    "the amplitude of temperature variations during the oscillation measured in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c is estimated to be 0.2 k by finite element simulations . during each period of oscillation",
    "the silicon working substance in the piezoresistive beam therefore goes through a thermodynamic cycle , similar to a stirling engine , during which it converts part of the resistive heat into work @xmath31 .",
    "the piezoresistive beam therefore operates as a heat engine .",
    "figure [ fig1]e shows the @xmath32 diagram and fig . [ fig1]f the phases of the thermodynamic cycle of the engine . in phase the speed of the mass results in an expansion of the engine beam at high temperature . in phase",
    "the strain in the beam is tensile , such that it is cooling because the piezoresistance of @xmath33-type silicon is low . as",
    "a consequence the temperature of the beam is reduced in phase such that the beam contracts at low temperature , until it reaches phase where the compressive strain causes a high piezoresistive heating power , resulting again in an elevated temperature in phase .",

    "[ fig3]a show that even below the threshold current @xmath42 the thermal fluctuations in the resonance mode are amplified .",
    "it is observed that the stored thermal energy in the resonance mode increases with dc current , such that it equals the energy which would be stored in the mode if the resonator would be at an effective temperature @xmath43 which is defined by @xmath44 .",
    "similar to resonators cooled by optical or rf methods@xcite the temperature @xmath43 represents the mechanical energy stored in the resonance mode corresponding to the degree of freedom @xmath8 and is not representative for the other degrees of freedom of the resonator . by integrating the fitted @xmath34 curves , @xmath43 is determined and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c . depending on the load impedance @xmath45 , the effective temperature @xmath43 of the resonance mode either increases like in a heat pump ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) or is refrigerated down to an effective temperature of 70 k at @xmath5=3.0 ma ( fig . [ fig3]b ) .",
    "the difference between the spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b is caused by the fact that the feedback coefficient @xmath17 is proportional to the ratio @xmath46 between the piezoresistive heating power @xmath47 and the ac resistance @xmath9 as can be seen from fig .",
    "therefore the coefficient @xmath17 can be written as the product of two complex numbers : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 depends solely on the device geometry and material parameters and @xmath50 can be controlled externally via @xmath45 in the following way .",
    "figure [ fig1]c shows that a resistance change @xmath9 of the beam will induce both an ac current @xmath51 and ac voltage @xmath52 .",

    "in order to gain insight in the operation of the heat engine , a schematic showing the rate equations for the flow of heat and work between electrical source , heat sink , engine beam and resonance mode is shown in fig .",

    "is pumped into the resonance mode , increasing @xmath43 until a new steady state is reached at which @xmath72 . in this mode",
    "the engine beam operates as a heat pump . for @xmath73 , the steady state rate equation in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a can only be satisfied with @xmath74 .",
    "therefore external work @xmath31 is generated and the engine beam operates as a heat engine .",
    "the distinction between the work and heat flows in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is subtle .",
    "for @xmath75 it follows that @xmath57 tends to infinity such that the motion of the resonator is perfectly sinusoidal , like in fig .",
    "this energy can theoretically be stored with 100% efficiency and should be called work . at any finite value of @xmath43",
    "the resonator performs a thermally driven random motion , which can not be fully converted into work according to carnot s theorem@xcite and should be called heat .",
    "for the miniaturization of engines a high power density @xmath76 is essential , since it determines the minimum size the engine can have in order to perform its task within the specified time .",
    "the maximum power @xmath77 that the demonstrated heat engine can generate is given by @xmath78 . in order to achieve the maximum power density ,",
    "a current @xmath5=5 ma is applied for which the amplitude of the centre of mass is limited by collisions with electrode t3 to @xmath8=100 nm . for an optimum value of i m @xmath17=100 a@xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) it is found that @xmath77=12.7 nw , about 4% of which is dissipated by the intrinsic losses ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "it thus follows that the piezoresistive heat engine , with an engine displacement volume of the engine beam of @xmath80  @xmath2m@xmath1 , has a power density @xmath81=37 gw / m@xmath1 which is almost a factor 1000 higher than that of car engines which have typical power densities of around 50 mw / m@xmath1 .",
    "the power density @xmath82 of the piezoresistive heat engine is also high when compared to other microengines @xcite , which have reported power densities up to 3 gw / m@xmath1 .",
    "however , in some of these cases the power density is defined using the volume of the total structure instead of the engine displacement volume . due to the relatively large size of the proof mass compared to the engine beam size ,",
    "this definition of power density is less favourable for the piezoresistive heat engine , yielding @xmath83=11 mw / m@xmath1 .    using the equations from fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , the efficiency of the presented engine is calculated to be @xmath846.4@xmath85 .",
    "besides being limited by the carnot theorem , the efficiency of the piezoresistive heat engine is also limited by the fracture limit of silicon to around @xmath86 , as analysed in the supplementary discussion b. it is therefore expected that the efficiency and power density of the piezoresistive heat engine can still be improved by a factor @xmath87500 by increasing the displacement amplitude and thermal design of the engine . even after optimization , this efficiency is low compared to that of micro- and nano - engines driven by electrostatic forces@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison in supplementary discussion b shows that piezoresistive heat engines have the potential to outperform electrostatic engines in terms of power density .",
    "this high power density and the absence of transistors can facilitate the development of mechanical actuator@xcite and sensor@xcite arrays with very high element densities .",
    "similar to other recently investigated cooling methods@xcite , the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator @xmath88 is very small when @xmath43 is at or below room temperature",
    ". the refrigerator will therefore not be useful for lowering the temperature of systems with many degrees - of - freedom .",
    "however , because the heat capacity @xmath89 of a single - degree - of - freedom resonance mode is only @xmath90 and because the thermal insulation of the mode is high as a result of its high @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) , the piezoresistive refrigerator can still reduce @xmath43 by more than 200 k. the brownian fluctuations associated with the energy @xmath91 often dominate the noise in mechanical sensors and mirrors and their reduction can thus increase the signal - to - noise ratio and might ultimately enable quantum - limited measurement and control of mechanical resonators .",
    "the presented piezoresistive refrigerator provides an alternative cooling method for reducing these brownian fluctuations , which has the advantage that it does not require laser or rf sources and only requires a silicon chip with a relatively low dc power .",
    "* structure * the piezoresistive heat engine in fig . [ fig1]a is made out of a 1.5 @xmath2 m thick silicon layer on a silicon - on - insulator wafer , with a phosphor doping concentration @xmath92=4.5@xmath310@xmath93 @xmath94 giving a specific resistivity of @xmath95=10@xmath96 m .",

    "the fracture strain limit of silicon which is in the range@xcite of @xmath189 0.01 - 0.03 , as a conservative estimate we use @xmath190 0.01 .",
    "the maximum expansion @xmath183 from compressive to tensile strain is given by be @xmath191 .",
    "therefore the optimal efficiency of a silicon thermal engine is estimated to be : @xmath192 higher efficiencies are possible if the strain is always kept compressive to enable higher @xmath183 , or by using a regenerator to reuse the heat lost during cooling .",
    "note that for quasi - static thermal actuators @xmath193 and the work done is @xmath194 , such that the optimal efficiency is lowered by a factor @xmath195 . even for @xmath196=100 k",
    ", a quasi - static actuator will have an optimal efficiency that is a factor 150 lower than the optimal dynamic effiency .",
    "for most quasi - static actuators the efficiency will be much lower because the thermal conduction rate @xmath197 will not only cool during the isothermal contraction , but during the whole cycle .",
    "now we continue to estimate the maximum efficiency of the piezoresistive heat engine . from figure 5a in the main manuscript",
    "it is found that the maximum rate of work done by the heat engine is given by @xmath198 .",

    "optimally @xmath139 is zero , however this would mean that there is no thermal conduction and no cooling of the heat engine . as a compromise @xmath201 is taken , reducing the efficiency by a factor 2 .",
    "thus it is found from equation ( [ beta ] ) that the maximum value of @xmath202 for the presented piezoresistive heat engine is given by : @xmath203    the highest measured value of i m @xmath17 is a factor 75 lower , of which a factor 9 can be attributed to @xmath158 , and the remaining factor @xmath878 is mainly due to a too high value of @xmath139 .",
    "the heating power in the beam is given by @xmath204 .",
    "the spring constant is given by @xmath179 and the average amplitude @xmath205 .",
    "thus the optimal efficiency of the piezoresistive heat engine is found to be : @xmath206    a small value value of @xmath153 does not reduce the efficiency , because the reduction in @xmath17 is compensated by the higher value of stored energy @xmath207 in the equation for @xmath77 . in other words ,",
    "the efficiency of the heat engine beam is independent of the resonator to which it is coupled . for the heat engine reported in the main manuscript ,",
    "the maximum strain in the engine beam is estimated with finite element simulation to be @xmath208 when operating at an amplitude of the center of mass @xmath209100 nm . moreover the measured i m @xmath210 is a factor 8 lower than optimal , such that the estimated efficiency is @xmath211 close to the measured value .",
    "the difference between the measured efficiency and equation ( [ etaprmax ] ) suggest that there is still room for efficiency improvement by a factor 500 of the presented heat engine concept by increasing its amplitude and reducing the heat conductivity parameter @xmath139 .",

    "based on the heat equation of a 1d beam with fixed temperature at its ends , the dc temperature rise in the engine beam is estimated as @xmath213 .",
    "the maximum power density of the piezoresistive heat engine is given by : @xmath214 where the equation has been evaluated at l=800 nm and @xmath215 k. even higher power densities can be achieved by reducing the beam length @xmath165 .",
    "when decreasing @xmath165 the frequency @xmath11 needs to go up to maintain a sufficient efficiency according to the condition @xmath216 and equation ( [ gh2 ] ) .",
    "a good heat sink is needed to keep the ends of the beam at low temperature .",
    "recently much progress has been made on engines operated by electrostatic forces@xcite .",
    "although these engines can have a high efficiency , their work per cycle is limited by the maximum energy@xcite that can be stored in the electric field ( @xmath2174@xmath218 j / m@xmath1 ) . assuming a 100% efficiency their power density is approximately limited by @xmath219 . comparing this with equation ( [ pdensmax ] )",
    "it is estimated that the power density of piezoresistive engines with a length @xmath220 nm will exceed that of electrostatic engines up to frequencies of 200 mhz . by lowering the length @xmath165 this limit",
    "can be pushed to even higher frequencies . despite their low efficiency",

    "the observed variation in the slope is due to the non - uniform temperature distribution in the structure in combination with the strong temperature dependence of tcr , which is near a minimum and is even observed to be slightly negative at room temperature@xcite . as a consequence of this , the total resistance of the structure is almost independent of @xmath5 around @xmath221=30@xmath224c , where the increase of resistance of the warmer parts compensates the decrease of resistance of the colder parts of the structure . from these data",
