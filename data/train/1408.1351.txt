    "the problem ( [ eq:1])-([eq:2 ] ) involving multi - dimensional time variables is called the initial - boundary value problem for ultraparabolic equation .",
    "the ultraparabolic equation has many applications in mathematical finance ( e.g. @xcite ) , physics ( such as multi - parameter brownian motion @xcite ) and biological model . among many applications ,",
    "the equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) arises as a mathematical model of population dynamics , for instance , the dynamics of the age structure of an isolated at the distinct moments of astronomical or biological time and @xmath10 in this application plays a role as the number of individuals of age @xmath11 in the population at time @xmath12 .",
    "the study of ultraparabolic equation for population dynamics can be found in some papers such as @xcite . in particular , kozhanov @xcite studied the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions and its properties for an ultraparabolic model equation in the form of    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is laplace operator , @xmath15 is a nonlocal linear operator . in the same work ,",
    "the authors deng and hallam in @xcite considered the age structured population problem formed    @xmath16    associated with non - locally integro - type initial - bounded conditions .",
    "the ultraparabolic equation is also studied in many other aspects . in the phase of inverse problems , lorenzi @xcite studied the well - posedness of a class of an inverse problem for ultraparabolic partial integrodifferential equations of volterra type .",
    "very recently , zouyed and rebbani @xcite proposed the modified quasi - boundary value method to regularize the equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) in homogeneous backward case in a class of ill - posed problems . for another studies regarding the properties of solutions of abstract ultraparabolic equations",

    "we only find some papers , such as @xcite .",
    "the authors akrivis , crouzeix and thome @xcite investigated a backward euler scheme and second - order box - type finite difference procedure to numerically approximate the solution to the dirichlet problem for the ultraparabolic equation ( [ eq:1])-([eq:2 ] ) in two different time intervals with the laplace operator @xmath17 and source function @xmath18 .",

    "however , we can see that most of papers for numerical methods aim to study linear cases .",
    "equivalently , numerical methods for nonlinear equations are investigated rarely .",
    "therefore , in this paper we shall study the model problem ( [ eq:1])-([eq:2 ] ) in the numerical angle for the smooth solution . from the idea of finite difference scheme and conveying a fundamental result in operator theory , we construct an approximate solution for the nonhomogeneous equation in terms of fourier series . combining the same technique and linear approximation ,",

    "in this section , we shall introduce the suitable discrete operator used in the time discretization . in order to define the discrete operator involved in the equation in the problem ( [ eq:1])-([eq:2 ] )",
