    "quantum field theories involving the chern - simons ( cs ) field in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions present many peculiar and surprising aspects .",
    "fractional spins , exotic statistics and the existence of massive gauge fields are well known examples in this direction . applications of these models are , for example , planar aharonov - bohm effect , fractional quantum hall effect and surface effects in liquid helium @xcite .",
    "physicists working in these theories have a special concern about their phase structure and phase transitions .",
    "these properties are investigated through the calculation of the renormalization group functions and the effective potential .",
    "so , renormalization and its intermediate step , regularization , are central issues to these studies .",
    "as the lagrangian density of the cs field involves the levi - civita tensor , these models are not easily extensible outside ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , making the dimensional regularization scheme @xcite , a very cumbersome procedure .",
    "in fact , besides the extension out of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , dimensional regularization for these models requires the introduction of an extra regularization term in the lagrangian . of course , a safe escape would be to avoid the use of regularizations at all , like in the bphz renormalization program @xcite , but this is also a complex procedure due to the zero mass fields involved @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , a simple regularization method called dimensional reduction , has been largely employed @xcite to deal with the cs models .",
    "it consists in a simplification of dimensional regularization , in which all tensor contractions appearing in feynman graphs , are first realized in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions and only the resulting scalar integrals are extended to @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "but , as stressed by several authors @xcite , this method may lead to ambiguities , jeopardizing the invariance of the theory under gauge transformations .",
    "nevertheless , given its great simplicity it may be worth to use dimensional reduction in practical calculations , after validating its consistency through the explicit verification of the ward identities related to the gauge symmetry .",
    "in this paper we calculate the effective potential for the theory of a massless complex scalar field with a sextuple self - interaction and minimally coupled with a cs field . dynamical symmetry breakdown and mass generation",
    "are explicitly verified not in one loop as in the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) @xcite model , but in the two - loop approximation .",
    "the feynman integrals are regularized by dimensional reduction . the verification that this regularization procedure preserves the ward identities ,",
    "was carried out in previous works @xcite .    the model",
    "is then extended by including a massless fermion minimally interacting with the cs field , and coupled to the scalar field through an `` yukawa '' term @xcite .",
    "up to two loops , the new graphs that appear in this extended model involve products of two levi - civita tensors at most .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , possible differences between the expressions calculated using dimensional reduction and dimensional regularization only appear in the product of three and more levi - civita tensors .",
    "therefore , up to the order we are dealing no breakdown of the ward identities takes place . here again symmetry breakdown occurs due to two - loop radiative corrections .",
    "curiously , for a certain relation between the yukawa and the scalar gauge couplings the effective potential is insensitive to the fermion gauge coupling .",
    "we also analyze some renormalization group aspects of the extended model by determining the modifications in the anomalous dimension of the scalar field and the _ beta _ function associated with the sextuple self - interaction .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ multi ] the effective potential for the scalar / cs model is calculated and the symmetry breakdown is discussed . in sec .",

    "[ group ] a renormalization group analysis of the model is performed . in the conclusions the comparison with the literature",
    "is carried .",
    "three appendices present the main integrals necessary in the work and the calculation of the wave function renormalization for the @xmath1 field .",
    "in this section we consider the model of a massless complex scalar field with a sextuple self - interaction and minimally interacting with a cs field , whose lagrangian density is    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a positive constant and @xmath4 .",
    "the metric used is @xmath5 and the fully antisymmetric levi - civita tensor @xmath6 is normalized as @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth to stress that all the parameters in this lagrangian are dimensionless , what makes it a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional analog of the well known cw model in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions . if instead of the cs",
    ", a maxwell dynamics for @xmath8 were used , a dimensional parameter would be introduced in the lagrangian and this analogy would be lost .",
    "it is convenient to decompose the complex scalar field as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real fields , so that the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) becomes :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and the summation convention is implied , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 running over 1 and 2 .",
    "we shall work in a t hooft gauge , which has the advantage of eliminating non diagonal terms in the free propagators .",

    "the third term is the sum of the two and more loops vacuum diagrams , calculated from @xmath43 ; it summarizes the infinity sum of all higher order loop diagrams with any number of external scalar lines @xmath44 , gotten from the original lagrangian ( [ 2 ] ) @xcite .",
