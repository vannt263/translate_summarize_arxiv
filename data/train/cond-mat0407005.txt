    "highly frustrated antiferromagnets are characterized by a very large number of essentially degenerate states , such that in a range of temperatures much smaller than the spin interaction scale they have strong local correlations , yet fail to order  @xcite : diffuse scattering is the obvious probe of such a state . in this paper ,",
    "i make the point that the classical ground - state ensemble can entail constraints that ensure a generic power - law decay of correlations : a picture of theses state as `` liquid - like '' ( i.e. featureless ) is thus imcomplete .",
    "we consider specifically the pyrochlore lattice , consisting of corner - sharing tetrahedra , partly because of its simplicity as a model [ high ( cubic ) symmetry and nearest - neighbor interactions ] , but most importantly because it is the magnetic lattice in many real systems : the b - site spinels  @xcite , two families of pyrochlores represented by @xmath1  @xcite , and the oxides @xmath2  @xcite , and even the transition - metal lattice in `` frustrated itinerant '' antiferro- or ferrimagnetic laves phases , such as @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "a parallel paper  @xcite contains many of the same results .",

    "the frustration of the pyrochlore ising model , and the extensive ground state entropy implied by ( [ eq : ground ] ) , were recognized very early  @xcite .      here",
    "i discuss the three different situations in which realistic models can be treated under this paper s scheme .",
    "[ readers who are content with a treatment of an ising toy model , and do not immediately demand any connection to experiment , may skip to sec .",
    "[ sec : coarse ] where the central result is derived . ]    first , it is possible that spin anisotropies ( additional to ( [ eq : hspin ] ) ) reduce the ground state manifold to the ising states . if the lattice is to remain cubic , the preferred axis can not be the same for each spin , but instead is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the unit vector of ( [ eq : uu ] ) , and @xmath18 labels the direction of the diamond - lattice bond on which spin @xmath19 sits .",
    "assuming the spins are strongly aligned , one puts @xmath20 and the hamiltonian reduces to ( [ eq : ham ] ) with @xmath21 , since @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for nearest neighbors .",
    "this is the `` spin - ice '' model  @xcite .",
    "the other two situations correspond to isotropic heisenberg models in the large-@xmath25 semiclassical regime ( where @xmath25 is the spin length ) .",
    "this is necessary to guarantee that ( [ eq : ground ] ) is a good starting point for specifying the ground states .",
    "one can identify a succession of energy scales in the pure nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet , corresonding to successive breakings of the grond state degeneracy as more effects are considered .",
    "the largest scale is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coordination number ; this is the scale of the mean - field ( classcial ) part of the exchange energy , and of the curie - weiss constant . at temperatures @xmath28 ,",
    "it is reasonable to approximate the spin ensemble by a subset of the ground - state ensemble .",
    "the spin - wave spectrum @xmath29 depends upon which state we linearized around .",
    "thus , the total spin - wave zero - point energy ( to harmonic order , @xmath30 ) partially breaks the ground - state degeneracy , favoring _",
    "collinear _ states ,  @xcite .",
    "this is expressed quantitatively by an effective hamiltonian  @xcite , with coupling constant @xmath31 , where the next largest scale is @xmath32 .",
    "( even when @xmath25 is not so large , e.g. @xmath33 as with real spins , the coefficient of @xmath34 is commonly less than @xmath35 so the inequality is valid . ) in lattices other than pyrochlore , one finds a similar regime in which a discrete subset of the classical ground states ( e.g. coplanar states ,  @xcite in the case ) gets selected by the harmonic zero - point energy .",
    "finer treatment of the spin - wave fluctuations produces an even smaller energy scale @xmath36 for selection among the discrete states . in the case ,  @xcite ; this is due to anharmonic terms in the holstein - primakoff expansion , so that @xmath37 . in the pyrochlore case , besides the anharmonic terms , @xmath36 does include contributions of @xmath38 from the harmonic terms .",
    "however , these terms only partly break the degeneracy , and the coefficients are small , so we can still assume @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the second regime in which the ising theory models the correlations is @xmath40 .",
    "one expects a symmetry breaking to long - range collinear order , in which a global axis @xmath41 is spontaneously adopted and each spin is given by @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , plus small fluctuations .",
    "this phase is a kind of `` spin nematic ''  @xcite .",
    "the energy terms distinguishing different ising states are unimportant since @xmath44 , hence the spin ensemble is roughly the ground states of ( [ eq : ham ] ) , as claimed .    of course , in the real world there is another energy scale @xmath45 for perturbations of the pure heisenberg hamiltonian , representing the magnitude further - neighbor exchange and dipole couplings , as well as lattice distortions , and disorder , which cause a transition or freezing into some other state at sufficiently low temperature , so the regime of the spin nematic - like phase is really @xmath46 .",
    "finally , the third situation is when @xmath47 .",
    "this ensemble is well modeled by the low-@xmath48 limit of the classical heisenberg model .",
    "it turns out ( sec .",
    "[ sec : heis - pol ] , below ) that the key notion of `` polarization '' does extend to the heisenberg spin case .",
    "i have mostly neglected that case in this paper because , at my level of approximation , the results look identical ; it would merely obscure the notation by adding spin - component indices everywhere .",
    "in this section , i present the steps leading to power - law correlations using the framework of a continuum theory , in the ideas appear more transparently .",
    "in fact the pyrochlore ( ising ) ground states map 1-to-1 onto those of the well - known diamond - lattice ice model  @xcite , in which the degrees of freedom are arrows along the lattice bonds . in the map ,",
    "every tetrahedron center becomes a vertex of the diamond lattice , while the spin sites map to bond centers of the diamond lattice .",
    "each spin @xmath49 maps to an arrow pointing along the corresponding diamond lattice edge , in the positive ( negative ) sense from the even to the odd vertex .",
    "this well - known mapping  @xcite is also used to model the `` spin ice '' system dy@xmath50ti@xmath50o@xmath51 ( and also ho@xmath50ti@xmath50o@xmath51 ) , wherein local @xmath52 anisotropy plus _ ferromagnetism _ makes a highly frustrated ising model  @xcite . )",
    "the ground state condition ",
    "net spin of every tetrahedron is zero  maps to the `` ice rule '' the numbers of incoming and outgoing arrows are equal at every vertex  @xcite .",
    "the key object in this paper is the ice polarization field . on a diamond - lattice bond",
    "a polarization @xmath53 can be defined , aligned from the even to odd diamond - lattice vertex if the spin is up , oppositely if it is down ; here @xmath18 is the local 3-fold axis of site @xmath19 . on every diamond vertex , we define the mean of this polarization over the surrounding tetrahedron of spins : @xmath54 the six possible ground - state configurations of that tetrahedron correspond to @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 .    finally , the coarse - grained arrow field @xmath58 is the coarse - grained polarization averaged over some larger neighborhood and assumed to vary smoothly .",
    "the ground - state entropy density is a function of the average polarization .",
    "a subensemble of states in which @xmath59 is large ( which can be forced by boundary conditions ) has relatively little freedom for rearrangements of the spins or arrows ; indeed , for a saturated polarization such as @xmath60 the ensemble consists of a single microstate .",
    "thus it is very plausible that the entropy density has a maximum for zero polarization .",
    "therefore , to lowest order , the total free energy ( arising entirely from entropy ) , as a function of coarse - grained @xmath58 , has the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the volume of a primitive unit cell .",
    "the `` stiffness '' @xmath63 is dimensionless , as appropriate since it is purely entropic in origin .",
    "corresponding to the condition ( [ eq : ground ] ) , i.e. the ice rule , @xmath58 satisfies a divergence constraint @xmath64 like a magnetic field without monopoles .",
    "( [ eq : fcoarse ] ) and ( [ eq : divergence ] ) look , respectively , like the field energy of a magnetic ( or electric ) field , and its divergence constraint , in the absence of monopoles ( or charges ) . these equations , together ,",
    "signify that that the probability distribution of the ( long - wavelength portion of ) the polarization field is the ( constrained ) gaussian distribution @xmath65    fourier transforming ( [ eq : fcoarse ] ) simply gives @xmath66 , so a naive use of equipartition would give @xmath67 .",
    "but the divergence constraint ( [ eq : divergence ] ) imposes @xmath68 in fourier space .",
    "thus the correct result has the longitudinal fluctuations projected out : @xmath69 fourier transforming ( [ eq : flucts ] ) back to direct space gives @xmath70",
    "\\label{eq : ice - dipolar}\\ ] ] at large separations @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ) _ correlations have the spatial dependence of a dipole - dipole interaction , _ which is a power law .",
    "models that exhibit such correlations  including the pyrochlore system , so often described as `` liquid - like '' ,  are thus , in a sense , in a _",
    "critical _ state . [ the generalization of ( [ eq : ice - dipolar ] ) for @xmath73-dimensional real space . would be a @xmath74 decay . ]",
    "this criticality was first appreciated in the ice model itself , being detected originally in a simulation  @xcite . a functional form with a dipolar singularity like ( [ eq : flucts ] ) was produced by a clever random - walk approximation to a series expansion  @xcite .",
    "the universal explanation , made here , that dipolar correlations arise from ( [ eq : fcoarse ] ) with the divergence condition , was first put forward to explain experiments on two - dimensional ice - like systems  @xcite .",
    "have also presented an ansatz equivalent to ( [ eq : poldist ] ) , derived the dipolar correlations , and confirmed them by simulations , for the dimer covering of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "[ see their eq .",
    "the @xmath75 decay has also been obtained analytically and numerically in ref .",
    ", for the pyrochlore model of this present paper",
    ".    ref .",
    "ii  d 1 , recognized that the ground - state constraint in the heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet ( [ eq : ground ] ) entails long - range correlations , but in the absence of the polarization concept , the argument s form is diffuse , and it was not possible to predict an explicit functional form .",
    "an interesting heuristic argument was made there to justify the empirical fact of the `` bowtie '' shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : strucf ] ) taken by the diffuse scattering : in other words , that it takes a scaling form in terms of @xmath76 .",
    "there is a linear relationship between the actual ising spins and the ice arrows : specifically , the map  ( [ eq : pol - alpha ] ) , from spins to the the diamond - vertex polarization is actually invertible : @xmath77 where we take the @xmath78 or @xmath79 signs for even and odd vertices @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the pseudodipolar correlations ( [ eq : ice - dipolar ] ) of the latter imply similar @xmath81 correlations for the former .",

    "the elastic constant @xmath63 must be determined from monte carlo simulations . yet , without knowing it , we can still make the nontrivial prediction that the diffuse scattering has quantitative the same strength near @xmath100 as it does near @xmath87 . in an isotropic heisenberg model",
    ", these pseudodipolar singularities can be distinguished from true dipolar singularities in neutron scattering experiments , since they are independent of spin direction",
    ". they can be seen in only one spatial direction around each reciprocal lattice point .",
    "the functional form ( [ eq : spindipolar ] ) has nodes which we expect ( correctly ) are a consequence of symmetry and therefore extend throughout reciprocal space , beyond the small-@xmath98 limit in which ( [ eq : spindipolar ] ) was derived .",

    "<S> the ground state ensemble of the highly frustrated pyrochlore - lattice antiferromagnet can be mapped to a coarse - grained `` polarization '' field satisfying a zero - divergence condition from this it follows that the correlations of this field , as well as the actual spin correlations , decay with separation like a dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a lattice version of the derivation gives an approximate formula for spin correlations , with several features that agree well with simulations and neutron - diffraction measurements of diffuse scattering , in particular the pinch - point ( pseudo - dipolar ) singularities at reciprocal lattice vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this system is compared to others in which constraints also imply diffraction singularities , and other possible applications of the coarse - grained polarization are discussed .    </S>",
