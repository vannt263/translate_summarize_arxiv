    "let us consider the plane motion in boundless ideal liquid of the  @xmath0  rectilinear filaments with the strengths  @xmath1 , crossing the plane in the points with coordinates  @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown by kirchhoff  [ 1 ] that the motion equations of such system can be written in the hamiltonian form : @xmath3 with the hamiltonian @xmath4    @xmath5    the poisson brackets are of the form : @xmath6    the system of equations  ( [ e1_1 ] ) has , beside of energy ( [ e1_2 ] ) , the first integrals due to the invariance of the hamiltonian with respect to translations and rotations of the coordinate system : @xmath7    the set of integrals ( [ e1_4 ] ) is not in involution : @xmath8      in this paper another representation of problem is given .",
    "let us choose the squares of mutual distances between the point vortices as new variables .",
    "for systems of  @xmath0  vortices the number of mutual distances is equal to  @xmath9 . then , commuting  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 in the poisson structure  ( [ e1_3 ] ) and using the heron formulas , we as a result obtain some nonlinear poisson brackets in the phase space determined by mutual distances .",
    "however , if we add new variables , the oriented areas of parallelograms spanned on triples of vortices with numbers  @xmath12 : @xmath13 then in the phase space of the variables  @xmath14 the lie  poisson brackets appear .",
    "the dimension of the phase is made up of the number of mutual distances between vortices ( the number of binomial combinations from  @xmath0 on  @xmath15 ) and the number of triangles formed by the triples of vortices ( the number of binomial combinations of  @xmath0 things  @xmath16 at a time ) ( see  fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath17 .    calculation of the poisson brackets between these variables using ( [ e1_3 ] ) leads to the following relations : @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    thus , in the  @xmath21-dimensional phase space of the variables  @xmath22 the lie  poisson brackets are determined .",
    "the structure of this algebra is as follows : @xmath23 besides the subalgebra  @xmath24 , this algebra contains subalgebras of problems of  @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,  3  vortices .",
    "the poisson brackets are degenerated .",
    "the linear casimir function @xmath27 is due to existence of the integral of angular momentum of vortex system .",
    "the linear casimir functions correspond to the trivial geometric relations between the oriented areas of triangles .",
    "let us write here , as an example , one such relation for a quadrangle  @xmath28 ( see  fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the annihilator of the brackets is @xmath29    the structure ( [ e1_9 ] ) has also the additional casimir functions .",
    "they came about from such relations as @xmath30 derived from the heron formula , relating the areas and lengthes of sides of a triangle . in general even in the problem of four vortices the functions ( [ e1_12 ] ) are not casimir functions ( they determine casimir functions of subalgebra of three vortices ) .",
    "the detailed analysis and classification of poisson brackets algebra ( [ e1_9 ] ) we plan to present in the next part of our work ( to be published ) .",
    "if we express  @xmath31 from ( [ e1_12 ] ) and substitute in the equations of motion for the squares of mutual distances  @xmath10 , then we get the equations of laura  [ 2 ] .",
    "having solved the equations of motion for the relative positions of vortices , we are able to find , using the quadratures and the initial conditions , the absolute coordinates of their positions on a plane at any time  [ 3 ] .",
    "the problems of three and four vortices are of particular interest .",
    "the integrability of the problem of three vortices was indicated already by poincar .",
    "the problem of four vortices is nonintegrable .    under reduction of the ten - dimensional algebra , corresponding to the problem of four vortices on the general level of six casimir functions ,",
    "the poisson structure becomes nondegenerate .",
    "so , according to the darboux theorem , there exist local canonical coordinates , in which the equations have the form of a usual hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom . for integrability of such system , besides the hamiltonian , one more first integral is required , which , in general case , does not exist .",
    "let us consider in detail a subalgebra ( [ e1_7])([e1_9 ] ) , corresponding to the case of three vortices .",
    "in variables  @xmath32 , @xmath24 it has the form : @xmath33    the rank of the algebra ( [ e1_13 ] ) is two .",
    "it corresponds on two - dimensional symplectic leaf to the system with one degree of freedom .",
    "depending on the ratio of intensities , this algebra is a direct sum  @xmath34 or  @xmath35 ( the case  @xmath36 is under consideration ) .",
    "analysis of this problem will be also given in our next publication .",
    "one can point out at an interesting analogy between the problem of three vortices and the system of lotka  volterra , appearing in mathematical biology  [ 4 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of three vortices @xmath37 generates the phase flow : @xmath38 @xmath39    expressing  @xmath40 from ( [ e1_12 ] )    @xmath41    we get the system :    @xmath42    if we introduce the regularizing time  @xmath43 :    @xmath44    then we find that  @xmath45 satisfy the lotka  volterra system : @xmath46    under transition of the system of vortices to a collinear configuration  @xmath47 a change of time flow is possible , so one must choose in ( [ e1_16 ] ) the sign plus .",
    "hence , we have demonstrated a piecewise trajectory isomorphism between two dynamical problems : the problem of three vortices and the three - dimensional lotka ",
    "volterra system , which takes place also in the problem of three vortices on a sphere , as it will be shown in the following section .",
    "let us note a partial case of integrability of four - vortex problem  [ 5 ] : @xmath48 in this case , the system has sufficient number of integrals  @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , in involution ( see the algebra of integrals ( [ e1_5 ] ) ) .",
    "its corresponding casimir function is  @xmath52 on zero level : @xmath53 due to the relation between the first integrals  [ 6 ] : @xmath54    additional invariant relations which are necessary for integrability in variables  @xmath10 one can find from the  @xmath55 identities  [ 6 ] @xmath56 being valid under  @xmath57 .",
    "let us indicate , for example , a particular solution of the system of four vortices if a central symmetry of the configuration takes place  [ 3 ] .",
    "if  @xmath58 , @xmath59 and vortices form a parallelogram on a complex plane  @xmath60 , then it preserves itself , i.e. in this case there are two invariant relations : @xmath61 having chosen an origin of coordinates , coinciding with the fixed symmetry center we can present the equations of motion in the form : @xmath62    here the notation : @xmath63 is used and , similarily to ( [ e1_18 ] ) , the regularization of time  @xmath43 : @xmath64 is made .",
    "the first pair of equations ( [ e1_24 ] ) describes motion of the sides of parallelogram and the second one describes motion of its diagonals .    equations ( [ e1_24 ] ) are hamiltonian with the hamiltonian : @xmath65 the poisson brackets are quartic by elements of the algebra : @xmath66    the poisson structure can be received from the bracket ( [ e1_13 ] ) under the restriction on the mentioned above invariant relations .",
    "now , its rank is two .",
    "the geometric casimir function is obtained from the relation between the squares of sides and the squares of diagonals in the parallelogram : @xmath67 for the real motions  @xmath68 is equal to zero .",
    "the casimir function ( [ e1_10 ] ) ( `` angular momentum '' of the system ) takes the form : @xmath69    a reduction of system ( [ e1_24 ] ) on casimir functions ( [ e1_28 ] ) , ( [ e1_29 ] ) reduces it to the one - dimensional integrable hamiltonian one  [ 6 ] .    one must note that in contrast to the rigid body dynamics the equations of motion in the `` internal '' variables do not have a standard invariant measure as well as even a measure with the analytical positive density . as a result dynamics of these problems is deeply different .    a reduction of system ( [ e1_24 ] ) on casimir functions ( [ e1_28 ] ) , ( [ e1_29 ] ) reduces it to the one - dimensional integrable hamiltonian one  [ 6 ] .",
    "one must note that in contrast to the rigid body dynamics the equations of motion in the `` internal '' variables do not have a standard invariant measure as well as even a measure with the analytical positive density .",
    "as a result dynamics of these problems is deeply different .",
    "let us consider a problem related to the previous one , a setting of which also goes back to the last century .",
    "in work  [ 8 ] i.s.gromeka obtained the equations of motion of point vortices on a sphere . the problem presents a simple model , describing a motion of vortex formations ( cyclones etc . ) in atmosphere of the earth .",
    "the dynamical equations have been written in  1885  year yet were nearly forgot , though the problem in many respects is similar to the problem of motion of point vortices on a plane . in the papers  [ 9,10 ] there",
    "were pointed to integrability of three vortices on a sphere . in the papers  [ 11 , 12 ]",
    "there were proved the integrability of the restricted problem of four vortices .",
    "we shall show that the equations of motion of  @xmath0 vortices on a sphere with the radius  @xmath70 can be presented in the hamiltonian form with degenerated poisson structure , assigned by jacobi algebra  @xmath71  [ 13 ] .",
    "in fact , in the usual canonical basis the equations of motion of  @xmath0 vortices on a sphere can be written in the form : @xmath72 where the canonical coordinates  @xmath73 , @xmath74 are expressed through the spherical angles  @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the strengths  @xmath77 as @xmath78 the hamiltonian function has the form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a cosine of the angle between @xmath81-th and @xmath82-th radius vectors , connecting the center of sphere with the point vortices ( see  fig .  2 ) .",
    "the equations of motion of  @xmath0 point vortices in the spherical system of reference have the following form  [ 9 ] : @xmath83 @xmath84 they are hamiltonian equations with poisson brackets @xmath85    the system ( [ e2_1 ] ) always has four integrals of motion @xmath86 @xmath87 which , however , are not in involution .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that the integrals  @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 commute as components of angular momentum : @xmath91      let us introduce the `` internal '' variables : @xmath92 being the squares of spans between arcs of corresponding vortices .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ e2_3 ] ) depends only on introduced mutual variables : @xmath93    from the relations between the canonical coordinates  @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( [ e2_6 ] ) it is possible to find commutators between the values  @xmath96 : @xmath97 where the following notations are used : @xmath98 let us note that we use the same notations in both considered problems .",
    "thus , the poisson brackets between the values  @xmath96 are proportional to external form of volume of parallelepiped spanned on the radius vectors of triple of vortices on a sphere .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that the algebra of variables  @xmath96 and  @xmath31 is closed .",
    "@xmath99    @xmath100    the quadratic algebra of vortices on a sphere is presented as a deformation of the linear algebra of vortices on a plane using the parameter   the radius of curvature of sphere  @xmath70 .",
    "the algebra of vortices on a plane ( [ e1_7])([e1_9 ] ) and the corresponding casimir functions of system on a sphere are obtained in the limit  @xmath101 @xmath102 , @xmath103 from the algebra ( [ e2_11])([e2_14 ] ) . here",
    "we symbolically marked by a symbol  @xmath104 ihe variables of the problem on the sphere .",
    "the linear casimir functions of the quadratic algebra analogous to the corresponding functions of the linear algebra ( [ e1_10])([e1_11 ] ) .",
    "the analog of the relations ( [ e1_12 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath105      in the spherical problem , the analogue of the partial case on the plane is a situation when the integrals of motion ( [ e2_7 ] ) have zero values : @xmath106 the case is completely integrable because there are sufficient number of commuting , on zero level , integrals .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain identity , analogous to ( [ e1_21 ] ) : @xmath107 consequently , the considered case corresponds to the level of casimir function : @xmath108 in order to find the invariant relations in variables  @xmath10 it is possible to use identity , between absolute and mutual coordinates , analogous to ( [ e1_22 ] ) : @xmath109",
    "the obtained forms of the dynamical equations on a plane and on a sphere can be successfully used for finding the steady - state configurations , being the partial solutions of the equations of motion",
    ".    requirements of  @xmath9 mutual distances  @xmath110 being constant are the conditions of stationary state of vortex configurations .",
    "they have the same form both for the configurations on a plane and on a sphere in the `` internal '' variables as its hamiltonians ( [ e1_2 ] ) , ( [ e2_10 ] ) and commutation relations  @xmath111 ( [ e1_7 ] ) , ( [ e2_10 ] ) have the same form : @xmath112    the conditions ( [ e3_1 ] ) are very suitable for finding symmetric configurations . on the plane",
    "there is solution of  @xmath0 vortices of equal strengths  @xmath113 , disposed in vertices of regular polygon , refined into a circle of radius  @xmath114 .",
    "the system rotates with angular velocity @xmath115 the analysis of stability of such configurations in linear approximation was carried out in  [ 15,16 ] .    for investigation of such configurations",
    "j.j.thomson was awarded with adams  prize in  1883  [ 15 ] .",
    "these solutions were at the basis of the theory of vortex atoms propagandized by w.kelvin ( before quantum mechanics ) .",
    "analogous configuration of identical vortices on a sphere is disposed , according to ( [ e3_5 ] ) , on latitude  @xmath116 , coordinates  @xmath117 are connected by conditions : @xmath118 ( see  fig .  3 ) .",
    "angular velocity of rotation about the axis  @xmath119 is : @xmath120      the next solution of the system ( [ e3_1 ] ) are collinear configurations : @xmath0  identical vortices on a line rotate with some angular velocity around axis perpendicular to the plane . on the sphere of radius  @xmath70 the collinear configuration ( @xmath0 atoms on the meridian ) rotates around the axis  @xmath119 with angular velocity  @xmath121 ( see  fig .  4 ) .",
    "collinear configurations of vortices on a sphere were not discussed in literature before .",
    "we can find them using the following conditions : coordinates  @xmath122 of the point vortices have the equal values or differ on  @xmath123 .",
    "in addition : @xmath124 . it is easy to notice that coordinates  @xmath125 , @xmath126 are roots of the following system of trigonometric equations : @xmath127    the chain of vortices ( [ e3_4 ] ) deserves more attention .",
    "the roots of the system assigned the collinear configuration  @xmath125 can be found as equilibrium position of the system of  @xmath0 particles on a circle set by the hamiltonian @xmath128 evidently , the positions of equilibrium of the chain of particles coincide with roots of the system ( [ e3_4 ] ) .",
    "such connection in plane case was marked by calogero  [ 17 ] .",
    "the locations of identical vortices on a line are set by zeros of hermitean polynomials of  @xmath0-th power .",
    "the system ( [ e3_5 ] ) under  @xmath129 was considered in  [ 18 ] , where statistical properties of levels of energies of one - dimensional classical coulomb gas are considered . in the paper  [ 19 ] the results of equilibrium analysis of the system ( [ e3_5 ] ) under condition  @xmath130 @xmath131 , @xmath132 are adduced .",
