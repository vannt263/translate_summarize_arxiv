    "<S> this is combined with the molecular gas fraction in order to derive the global dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces very well the observed star formation laws extending from low gas surface densities up to the starburst regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our results show a dependence of @xmath0 on metallicity over the entire range of gas surface densities in contrast to other models , and can also explain part of the scatter in the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a tabulated form of the star formation laws that can be easily incorporated into numerical simulations or semi - analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution . </S>"
