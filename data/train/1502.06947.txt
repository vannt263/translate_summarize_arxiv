    "given a space curve @xmath8 called spine curve , a canal surface associated to this curve is defined as a surface swept by a family of spheres of varying radius @xmath9 . if @xmath9 is constant , the canal surface is called a tube or a pipe surface .",
    "the canal surface can be thought out as a generalization of the classical consept of an offset of a plane curve . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the analysis and algebraic features of offset curves are discussed thoroughly . in @xcite , do carmo gives some geometrical properties of tube surfaces and by means of these surfaces proves two very important theorems in differential geometry related to the total curvature of space curves , named as fenchel s theorem and the fary - milnor theorem .",
    "apart from being used in pure mathematics , canal surfaces are widely used in many areas especially in cagd , e.g. construction of blending surfaces , i.e. canal surface with a rational radius , shape reconstruction or robotic path planning ( see , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "greater part of the studies on canal surfaces within the cagd context is related to the search of canal surfaces with rational spine curve and rational radius function .",
    "canal surfaces are also useful in visualising long thin objects such as poles , 3d fonts , brass instruments or internal organs of the body in solid / surface modeling and cg / cad .",
    "tori , dupin cyclids in @xcite and tube surfaces in @xcite are the special types of the canal surfaces .    given a surface @xmath6 in euclidean space @xmath0 and its two principal curvatures @xmath1 and @xmath10 @xmath6 is a weingarten surface under the condition that there is a smooth relation @xmath11 @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote respectively the gaussian curvature and the mean curvature of @xmath6 , @xmath15 refers that @xmath16 which is equivalent to the vanishing of the corresponding jacobian determinant , i.e. @xmath17 also , if the surface satisfies a linear equation with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , that is , @xmath18 ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then it is called as a linear weingarten surface @xcite .",
    "frenet - serret frame gives way to the study of curves in classical differential geometry in euclidean space .",
    "however , the frenet frame can not be constructed at the points in which curvature vanishes .",
    "hence , an alternative frame is needed . in @xcite ,",
    "bishop defined a new frame for a curve and called it bishop frame , which is well defined even if the curve s second derivative in @xmath21-dimensional euclidean space vanishes . in @xcite",
    "the advantages of the bishop frame and the comparison of bishop frame with the frenet frame in euclidean @xmath21-space were given .",
    "euclidean @xmath22-space @xmath0 has the same problem as euclidean 3-space .",
    "that is , one of the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) derivatives of the curve may be zero .",
    "in @xcite using the similar idea authors considered such curves and construct an alternative frame .",
    "they gave parallel transport frame of a curve and introduced the relations between the frame and frenet frame of the curve in @xmath22-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "they generalized the notion which is well known in euclidean @xmath21-space for @xmath22-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 .    in @xcite authors considered canal surfaces imbedded in an euclidean space of four dimensions .",
    "they investigated the curvature properties of these surface with respect to the variation of the normal vectors and curvature ellipse .",
    "they also gave some special examples of canal surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "further , they gave necessary and sufficient condition for canal surfaces in @xmath0 to become superconformal .    in the present study",
    ", we consider canal surfaces imbedded in euclidean @xmath22-space @xmath0 with the spine curve @xmath5 given with parallel transport frame in @xmath4    this paper is organized as follows : section @xmath25 gives some basic concepts of the frenet frame and parallel transport frame of a curve in @xmath26 also this section provides some basic properties of canal surfaces in @xmath0 and the structure of their curvatures .",
