    "disentanglement is triggered by observing the ec decay , at which time the daughter ion @xmath1 and the undetected electron neutrino @xmath23 are entangled with each other , whereas the observation of @xmath1 in storage - ring circular motion guided by external em fields occurs when @xmath1 is no longer entangled with @xmath23 from which it was disentangled at the @xmath2 decay time .",
