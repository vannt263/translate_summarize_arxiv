    "a low - momentum space nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interaction has been extensively studied in recent years @xcite . if we start with the full space realistic @xmath5 interaction , the discussion is focused on the evaluation of an effective @xmath5 interaction in a low - momentum space which reproduces the same eigenvalues or @xmath6-matrices in the low - momentum space as those of the original interaction . in this paper , we call such an effective interaction in a restricted space as an _ equivalent interaction_. it was demonstrated @xcite that after the high momentum components corresponding to short - range repulsion are renormalized , various @xmath5 potential models give essentially the same low - momentum @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the construction of an energy - independent equivalent interaction in a model space has been one of the main subjects in effective interaction theories in various field .",
    "okubo @xcite proposed in 1950 s a unitary transformation method to eliminate meson - degrees of freedom to obtain the @xmath5 potential . through 1950",
    "s to 1970 s , numerous theoretical works @xcite have been devoted to nuclear many - body problems starting from realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions . in the context of the shell model effective interaction , suzuki and lee @xcite formulated a decoupling condition method using a similarity transformation and an iterative procedure to solve the decoupling equation .",
    "the theory behind recent developments is closely related to this viewpoint .",
    "on the two - body level , the collapse of various realistic @xmath5 interactions to the universal interaction in a low - momentum space @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xmath9 seems not to be surprising because of abundant @xmath5 scattering data in the corresponding energy region . in the strangeness non - zero sectors",
    "the scattering data is scarce at present , although studies of the hyperon - nucleon @xmath10 and hyperon - hyperon @xmath11 interactions have been accelerated with the experimental progress in hyper - nuclear physics .",
    "thus the construction of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 potentials has to rely on a certain theoretical framework to a large extent .",
    "the nijmegen group @xcite has been revising the @xmath4 potentials on the basis of the one - boson exchange potential ( obep ) picture since the end of 1970 s .",
    "the initial hard - core models @xcite were replaced by the soft - core parameterization @xcite .",
    "the jlich group @xcite has also been developing another obep model . in spite of the basic flavor su@xmath13 relations , there are still much uncertainties in the construction of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 potentials .",
    "a different unified description was proposed for the octet baryon - baryon interactions by the kyoto - niigata group @xcite on the basis of an su@xmath3 quark model , in which the gluonic interaction in the resonating group method ( rgm ) for two composite nucleons composed of three quarks is supplemented by the long - ranged one - boson exchange interaction between quarks .",
    "the most recent model fss2 @xcite achieves comparable accuracy in the @xmath5 sector to modern realistic @xmath5 potentials .",
    "the advantage of the su@xmath3 quark model is that the extension of the potential parameters determined in the @xmath5 sector to the strangeness @xmath14 and @xmath15 sectors seems to be less ambiguous than the obep models .",
    "recently , a novel method based on the chiral effective field theory has been applied to the strangeness @xmath14 and @xmath16 baryon - baryon interactions @xcite .",
    "because the present potential models for the @xmath4 interaction are not well regulated by experimental data , the equivalent interaction after removing the high - momentum components can still be model dependent . in other words , properties of these equivalent interactions",
    "reflect the character of the underlying potential model .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare the low - momentum space @xmath4 interactions obtained from different bare potential models .",
    "the evaluation of low - momentum @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions was recently reported by schaefer _",
    "@xcite for the momentum cut - off value of @xmath17 @xmath9 , using several nijmegen nsc potentials @xcite .",
    "the new feature in the @xmath4 interactions is the presence , in most cases , of the coupling between two or three baryon - channels , such as @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath2-@xmath18-@xmath19 , and @xmath2-@xmath20-@xmath19 couplings . in this paper",
    ", we present equivalent interactions in the low - momentum space with @xmath21 @xmath9 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials starting from the su@xmath3 quark model bare potentials @xcite .",
    "we choose this cut - off value as a typical low - momentum scale for which the potential model dependence is almost eliminated in the case of the @xmath5 interaction @xcite .",
    "the naive definition of the potential based on the rgm formalism leads to an energy - dependent potential through the norm kernel .",
    "such energy - dependence is not suited for the equivalent interaction theory .",
    "recently , the method to eliminate the energy - dependence has been developed @xcite , using a renormalized rgm formalism .",
    "we use this prescription for the quark model potential .",
    "there is another complexity inherent in the rgm formulation of the baryon - baryon interaction , which is the presence of a pauli forbidden state in certain channels .",
    "the interaction has to be applied in the space in which the pauli forbidden state is projected out . in other words ,",
    "an orthogonal condition to the forbidden state has to be imposed when solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "this condition is not removed even if the energy - dependence is eliminated .",
    "fortunately , however , on - shell and half - on - shell @xmath6-matrices are not influenced by the redundant component @xcite . it is noted that the pauli forbidden state appears only in the 1s0 ( 11)s state in the model space of the baryon - octet bryon - octet interaction , specified by the elliott notation @xmath22 .    for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases",
    ", we also employ the nijmegen nsc97f model .",
    "our results with the nsc97f potential are mostly in accord with those shown by schaefer _",
    "after removing high - momentum components , we still observe model dependence , in particular in @xmath1 channels .",
    "the comparison of the results with the quark model and the obep model demonstrates different characters of these potential models .    in sec .",
    "ii , we recapitulate the basics of the equivalent interaction theory in a model space . in the framework which was initiated by suzuki and lee @xcite and developed afterword by collaborators @xcite with including the generalization @xcite to the case that the unperturbed model - space energies are non - degenerate , the mapping operator @xmath23 which connects the model space @xmath24 and the rest @xmath25 space plays an essential role to explicitly calculate the equivalent interaction .",
    "the mapping operator @xmath23 is determined by the decoupling condition , which leads to a non - linear equation for @xmath23",
    ". this operator @xmath23 can also be obtained by a linear equation by using the knowledge of the half - on - shell @xmath6-matrices , as derived by epelbaum _",
    "we show , in sec .",
    "ii , a compact derivation of the linear equation . the actual evaluation of the equivalent interaction can be carried out by discretizing the entire momentum space as was argued in the paper by fujii _",
    "we extend this method to the case of @xmath4 interactions , in which there are couplings among several baryon - channels .",
    "results of numerical calculations are presented in sec .",
    "we show only the diagonal matrix elements . because the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "potential of the hyperon in infinite nuclear matter is determined by them in the lowest order , they can provide useful information about properties of the hyperon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we first give the results for the @xmath5 interaction for comparison , then present @xmath0 and @xmath1 equivalent interactions in the low - momentum space with @xmath26 @xmath9 calculated both for fss2 and nsc97f .",
    "equivalent interactions for @xmath2 are evaluated only for fss2 .",
    "section iv summarizes the results of the present paper .",
    "we recapitulate basic elements of the equivalent interaction theory , following the method by suzuki and lee @xcite .",
    "let us denote the original hamiltonian in the entire space by @xmath27 , and divide the full hilbert space into a model space and the rest which are denoted by their relevant projection operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ; @xmath28 . in particular ,",
    "the low - momentum space in the two - body problem is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the problem is to find the equivalent operator @xmath30 in the model space @xmath24 , which reproduces the eigenvalue as those of the original @xmath31 .",
    "a formal approach has been well known as the feshbach projection method @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to present the schrdinger equation @xmath32 in a matrix form . @xmath33",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the following equation in the model space @xmath24 by eliminating @xmath34 in terms of @xmath35 : @xmath36 thus @xmath30 can be identified with @xmath37 in this case we obtain the energy - dependent effective interaction in the model space .",
    "this expression is rather formal , since it includes the energy @xmath38 to be solved .",
    "it is pedagogical to remark that if @xmath39 has the property of @xmath40 or @xmath41 , @xmath42 is nothing but @xmath30 from the beginning .",
    "suzuki and lee @xcite proposed in 1980 the way to construct the energy - independent equivalent potential in the context of the similarity transformation .",
    "their consideration serves as the basic for the recent development of various effective interaction theories .",
    "it is elementary to observe that the eigenvalues of the original hamiltonian @xmath31 do not change when @xmath31 is transformed by a similarity transformation , namely by a regular matrix @xmath43 and its inverse @xmath44 as @xmath45 . as noted above",
    ", if @xmath46 holds , @xmath47 becomes the equivalent interaction in the model space @xmath24 .",
    "thus the task to find @xmath30 is reduced to determine @xmath43 which satisfies @xmath46 .",
    "it is sufficient first to consider a regular matrix @xmath43 in the following form . @xmath48",
    "the mapping matrix @xmath49 , which connects the @xmath24 and @xmath25 spaces , plays a central role in the following .",
    "the decoupling condition @xmath46 now reads : @xmath50 because this is a non - linear equation for @xmath23 , we have to use some iteration method to solve it . determining the mapping operator @xmath23",
    ", we obtain an energy - independent equivalent interaction in the model space @xmath24 as @xmath51 .",
    "this equivalent hamiltonian is not hermitian at this stage .",
    "if we utilize a unitary matrix @xmath52 in the following okubo form @xcite constructed from @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) to transform the original @xmath31 , @xmath53 the equivalent hamiltonian is apparently hermitian .",
    "the general argument of constructing an hermitian equivalent interaction was given in ref .",
    "it has to be stressed that other operators corresponding to physical observables are also transformed accordingly .",
    "although the equation ( 5 ) for @xmath23 is non - linear , epelbaum _ et al .",
    "_ showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the linear equation can be set up for the mapping operator @xmath23 by the use of the half - on - shell @xmath6-matrices in the case of the two - body problem .",
    "this linear equation for @xmath23 is easily derived in the above context as follows . by definition ,",
    "the equivalent interaction in the @xmath24 space @xmath54 is to reproduce the original @xmath6-matrices in the @xmath24 space .",
    "namely we expect that the following equation should hold .",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the on - shell energy and we are considering half - on - shell @xmath6-matrices . the original equation for @xmath6 in the @xmath24 space is @xmath57 comparing eq .",
    "( 8) with eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we obtain @xmath58 taking out the common @xmath59 , we are led to the linear equation for @xmath23 : @xmath60",
    "when the role of the mapping operator @xmath23 is figured out , we can devise a direct calculational procedure to determine @xmath23 , as was explained as method-2 and used in ref .",
    "the extension to the case in which several baryon - channels couple each other , e.g. , the treatment of the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition , is straightforward . in principle , there is no difference in the calculational method for the tensor coupling and the baryon - channel coupling .",
    "we only have to enlarge the dimension of the relevant hilbert space .",
    "it is noted that in the hyperon - nucleon interaction such a coupling between @xmath61 and @xmath62 channels also appears through the antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction which is absent in the @xmath5 case , although we do not examine the @xmath24-waves in the following .",
    "we calculate equivalent @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrix elements in the low - momentum space with the cut - off value of @xmath63 @xmath9 for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 partial waves , starting from the kyoto - niigata su@xmath3 quark model potential fss2 @xcite .",
    "this momentum scale should be regarded as a representative one for which the potential model dependence of the description of high momentum components has been shown @xcite to disappear in the case of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the nijmegen nsc97f @xcite is also used for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions .",
    "these two potentials are especially different in the manner of constructing the short - range part .",
    "the nijmegen obep model is based on the heavy meson exchange picture , while the quark model uses a rgm framework for nonrelativistic quark - clusters . as noted in introduction ,",
    "the energy - dependence from the rgm kernel is renormalized to give an energy - independent potential @xcite .",
    "although the calculational procedure is straightforward to treat the baryon - channel coupling , we have to be careful to interpret the matrix elements of the equivalent interaction in the @xmath24 space . to obtain physically meaningful quantities such as hyperon s.p .",
    "energies in nuclear medium , we have to further solve the baryon - channel coupling problem in the @xmath24 space .",
    "if the coupling effect in the @xmath24 space is important , the matrix elements before solving the coupling problem give no clear physical insight .",
    "we encounter such a typical example in the @xmath2 @xmath66 channel .      before showing the equivalent interactions in the low - momentum space for the hyperon - nucleon sectors , we present results of the @xmath5 interaction for comparison .",
    "diagonal matrix elements of the quark model potential fss2 @xcite in the low - momentum space with @xmath21 @xmath9 are shown by solid curves in figs . 1 and 2 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively",
    ". these results are very close to those of the nijmegen potential nsc97f depicted by dashed curves .",
    "it demonstrates that the quark model potential fss2 achieves the same level accuracy as modern realistic @xmath5 interactions , although the description at the short - range part is considerably different due to the rgm treatment .",
    "the thin curves in figs . 1 and 2 for the bare matrix elements illustrate that the short - range repulsion of fss2 is rather moderate",
    ".      properties of the @xmath0 interaction has been known empirically to some extent , based on the scattering data from bubble chamber experiments and the data of @xmath67 hypernuclei in last 30 years .",
    "the central part is fairly well known from the universal depth of the @xmath67-nucleus potential of about 30 mev , from light to heavy @xmath67-hypernuclei , while the non - central component is still ambiguous .",
    "although the smallness of the @xmath67 s.p .",
    "spin - orbit splitting in hypernuclei has been established experimentally @xcite , its relation to the two - body @xmath0 interaction has not been settled .",
    "one of the possible explanations has been offered by the quark model @xcite by pointing out the role of the antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction which can almost cancel the contribution from the ordinary spin - orbit interaction . in this paper , however , we do not discuss this subject , because we present the results only for @xmath68-waves .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the low - momentum space diagonal matrix elements of the equivalent @xmath0 interaction in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 channels with @xmath21 @xmath9 together with bare matrix elements , both for the quark model potential fss2 @xcite and the nijmegen potential nsc97f @xcite . in order to see the effects of the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling , we also present results with turning off the coupling potential by the thin curves .",
    "the nijmegen potential and the quark model potential provide very similar matrix elements in the low - momentum space , though the bare matrix elements are different from each other , reflecting the different character in the short - range part .",
    "again the short - range repulsion of fss2 is moderate .    in the @xmath64 channel , the effect of the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling",
    "is seen to be negligibly small for nsc97f . because the pion - exchange is absent in this partial wave",
    ", the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling is expected to be weak . in the quark model description ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different . in the rgm treatment of the two quark - clusters",
    "the pauli forbidden state appears in this @xmath64 @xmath0-@xmath1 channel . when the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling is switched off , the orthogonality to the pauli forbidden state on the quark level is not strictly satisfied , which may cause an artificial coupling effect observed in fig .",
    "3 . this feature deserves future investigation .",
    "the @xmath65 channel is free from the pauli forbidden state . comparing the thick and thin curves in fig .",
    "4 , we see that the considerable amount of the attractive contribution comes from the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling in the outer space beyond @xmath21 @xmath9 .",
    "it is remarkable to see that the two potential models give almost identical diagonal matrix elements in the low - momentum space both for @xmath64 and @xmath65 channels , though the bare matrix elements are different .",
    "this implies that the potential model for the @xmath0 @xmath68-wave interaction is now almost under control .",
    "the study of @xmath24-waves , in particular the magnitude of the spin - orbit and antisymmetric spin - orbit components , is an important future subject .",
    "the careful study of @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling effects , including those within the low - momentum space , is also required , because hypernuclear @xmath69-spectroscopic measurements @xcite with the accuracy of the order of kev are beginning to provide the data of excitation spectrum of @xmath67 hypernuclei .",
    "the @xmath1 interaction has been expected to have specific spin and isospin dependences .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the net attractive interaction in the @xmath64 @xmath70 channel can yield the bound @xmath71he hypernucleus with @xmath72 , which corresponds to the experimental observation in the @xmath73he@xmath74 reactions with the stopped kaon @xcite as well as the kaon in flight @xcite .",
    "however , probably due to the repulsion in the @xmath65 @xmath70 channel , @xmath75 bound states are unlikely in heavier nuclei , which has been supported by experimental results on targets @xmath76li and @xmath77be @xcite .    the quark model picture has been known from the earlier studies @xcite to give a definite prediction that certain partial waves such as the @xmath1 @xmath65 @xmath70 state should be strongly repulsive due to the quark pauli effect , which has no explicit counterpart in the obep model .",
    "the character related to the pauli effect might be uncovered in the low - momentum space equivalent interaction .",
    "the @xmath70 channels have no @xmath1-@xmath0 coupling because the @xmath67 hyperon is isosinglet .",
    "figure 5 shows the diagonal matrix elements of the low - momentum space equivalent @xmath1 interaction in the @xmath64 @xmath70 channel .",
    "results for fss2 @xcite and nsc97f @xcite are shown by the solid and dashed curves , respectively , while bare matrix elements up to @xmath78 @xmath9 are shown by the dotted curves .",
    "the tendency of how high - momentum components are renormalized is similar to the @xmath5 @xmath64 case .",
    "the attractive interaction in this channel is important for the existence of the bound @xmath71he state .",
    "the quark model potential is sufficiently attractive to yield the bound state as the nijmegen potential does . in the viewpoint of the quark model @xcite ,",
    "the flavor su@xmath13 symmetry tells that this channel is dictated by the ( 22 ) symmetric component of the elliott notation @xmath22 .",
    "this component is the same as in the @xmath64 ( @xmath66 ) @xmath5 state , and thus the rather strong attractive character after renormalizing high - momentum components is reasonable .",
    "quantitatively different results are obtained between fss2 and nsc97f in the @xmath65 @xmath70 channel , which are shown in fig .",
    "the quark model potential predicts repulsive interaction , which comes from the quark pauli effect .",
    "the correlation due to the pauli effect is not so short - ranged , as the magnitude of the matrix element at @xmath78 @xmath9 indicates .",
    "the repulsive character persists in the low - momentum space . on the other hand",
    ", the nsc97f model does not have strong repulsion and the low - momentum equivalent interaction is attractive . owing to the spin and isospin weight factors , this @xmath65 @xmath70 state dominantly contributes to the @xmath75 s.p .",
    "potential in nuclear medium .",
    "analyses @xcite of the @xmath79 @xmath75 formation inclusive spectra @xcite have indicated that the @xmath75-nucleus mean field is repulsive .",
    "figure 7 shows results for the @xmath64 @xmath80 state .",
    "the thin solid curve presents the result for which the @xmath1-@xmath0 channel - coupling is neglected .",
    "the corresponding result for nsc97f is shown by the dashed curve .",
    "bare matrix elements are also shown up to @xmath78 @xmath9 .",
    "both potential models predict repulsive interaction in this channel .",
    "as we have already seen in the @xmath0 interaction , the @xmath1-@xmath0 channel - coupling effect is very weak in nsc97f .",
    "it is noteworthy that the diagonal matrix elements in the low - momentum space become more repulsive in nsc97f when renormalizing the high - momentum attractive components .",
    "figure 8 shows results for the @xmath65 @xmath80 state .",
    "here we see characteristic difference for the prediction of the @xmath1-@xmath0 coupling effect between fss2 and nsc97f .",
    "the behavior of the diagonal matrix elements with fss2 resembles that of the @xmath5 @xmath65 state given in fig.2 .",
    "in fact , from the flavor su@xmath13 symmetry this channel has a ( 03 ) component by 50% , which is the component of the @xmath5 @xmath65 interaction . because the other half component of the ( 11)@xmath81 gives a minor contribution , the @xmath1 interaction in the @xmath65 @xmath80 state should be similar to the @xmath5 @xmath65 interaction in the quark model description .",
    "in contrast , weakly repulsive matrix elements are seen for the @xmath65 @xmath80 @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction from nsc97f .",
    "it has to be remarked , however , that the @xmath1-@xmath0 coupling in the @xmath24 space , which is not yet taken into account , can change even the sign of the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "in fact , @xmath82-matrix calculations @xcite in symmetric nuclear matter with using nsc97f tells that the contribution from this channel to the @xmath75 s.p .",
    "potential in nuclear medium is attractive and becomes repulsive if we switch off the @xmath1-@xmath0 coupling .",
    "this fact simply means that we have to be careful to interpret the matrix elements in the case that there exist coupling channels and the coupling effect is important in the low - momentum space .",
    "we encounter such a situation also in the @xmath2 @xmath64 @xmath66 state .",
    "( a )    ( b )    there are two kinds of sources for the experimental information about the baryon - baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath16 sector .",
    "one is the estimation of a @xmath83-nucleus s.p .",
    "potential from dwia analyses @xcite of the @xmath84 @xmath85 formation spectra on @xmath86c .",
    "the tentative conclusion is that the depth of the s.p .",
    "potential is about 14 mev .",
    "the other clue is the strength of the @xmath87 attraction through binding energies of double-@xmath67 hypernuclei .",
    "the recent discovery of @xmath88he @xcite has indicated that the attraction of the @xmath87 interaction is rather weak .",
    "there is also an attempt @xcite to measure the @xmath89 inelastic cross section and deduce the @xmath87 correlation in the @xmath83 formation reaction .",
    "nevertheless all these experimental data are in the rudimentary stage and far from sufficiently constraining the interactions which have a variety of baryon - channel couplings .",
    "thus the investigation using theoretical models of the @xmath2 interaction is important .",
    "because the computer code for the nijmegen @xmath2 interaction was not available , we present results only with the kyoto - niigata quark model potential fss2 @xcite .",
    "figure 9 shows the low - momentum space equivalent @xmath2 interaction in the @xmath64 @xmath90 state with @xmath21 @xmath9 together with the bare matrix elements up to @xmath78 @xmath9 . if the coupling to the @xmath87-@xmath19 channel is neglected , the diagonal matrix element of the equivalent interaction in the low - momentum space is close to that of the bare interaction , which indicates that the correlation in the @xmath2-@xmath2 channel itself is rather weak .",
    "the result of the large attraction in the @xmath2 interaction in the low - momentum space originates from the baryon - channel coupling effect . among other @xmath68-waves ,",
    "this channel turns out to be most attractive .",
    "as noted in the previous section , however , it is necessary to explicitly treat the @xmath2-@xmath18-@xmath19 coupling in the @xmath24 space in order to obtain more physically meaningful information .    the @xmath64 @xmath66 state is shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) . in this state",
    "the @xmath19 channel is not allowed and the the @xmath2 state couples only with the @xmath20 state .",
    "looking at the matrix elements at large @xmath91 , we observe that the the short - range repulsion is weak in this @xmath2-@xmath2 channel .",
    "it is found in this channel that because the baryon - coupling effect is strong , the sign of the diagonal matrix elements does not indicate the property of the interaction .",
    "for example , we show , in fig .",
    "10(b ) , the diagonal matrix elements of the low - momentum equivalent interaction with the cut - off value of @xmath92 @xmath9 . in this case",
    "@xmath2-@xmath2 diagonal matrix elements are mostly positive . in between @xmath92 @xmath9 and 2 @xmath9 ,",
    "the diagonal matrix elements change sign , which suggests that the baryon - channel coupling effects in the @xmath24 space are decisively important , and thus the @xmath2 and @xmath20 states are strongly mixed .",
    "the @xmath65 @xmath90 state is classified to the pure @xmath93 state in the flavor su@xmath13 symmetry and no baryon - channel coupling appears in this state .",
    "the quark model @xcite predicts that the bare @xmath2 interaction is already weak .",
    "figure 11 shows that the low - momentum equivalent @xmath2 interaction in this partial wave becomes slightly attractive .    as is shown in fig .",
    "12 , the quark model potential fss2 predicts that the @xmath2 interaction in the @xmath65 @xmath66 state is also not so strong . due to the @xmath2-@xmath20-@xmath19 coupling",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of the low - momentum equivalent @xmath2 interaction can be slightly negative .",
    "altogether , the quark model potential fss2 @xcite predicts that the @xmath2 interactions in @xmath65 channels are weak . for the estimation of the @xmath83-nucleus s.p .",
    "potential in nuclear medium , we expect an attractive contribution from the @xmath64 @xmath90 state but a repulsive contribution from the @xmath64 @xmath66 state .",
    "higher partial waves may play an important role for the @xmath83-nucleus s.p . potential .",
    "we have calculated low - momentum space equivalent interactions for hyperon - nucleon interactions , starting from two models of the bare potentials , the quark model potential fss2 @xcite and the nijmegen obep model nsc97f @xcite .",
    "an effective interaction in a restricted space which reproduces the same eigenvalues or @xmath6-matrices in that space as those of the original full - space interaction is named as an equivalent interaction in this paper .",
    "the quark model potential uses a rgm framework , thus the naive definition of the baryon - baryon interaction on the basis of the rgm born kernel is energy - dependent .",
    "recently , the technique to eliminate the energy - dependence was developed @xcite .",
    "we have used this prescription for the quark model potentials for the octet baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "the calculation of the low - momentum space equivalent interaction for the quark model potential is interesting in two aspects .",
    "one is related to the different non - local character from that of the one - boson exchange picture , especially at short distance due to the rgm treatment of two quark - composite clusters .",
    "another point is that the extension of the potential to the strangeness @xmath14 and @xmath16 sectors based on the parameters fixed in the @xmath5 sector has been shown @xcite to be less ambiguous than the obep model .",
    "it is useful to elucidate the similarity and the difference in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions between the quark model and the nijmegen model . as the representative potential for the latter model ,",
    "we have employed the nsc97f @xcite , which was used in the similar calculations recently reported by schaefer _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the merit of considering the low - momentum space equivalent interaction for the @xmath4 interactions is to eliminate the model dependent characters at short distance , as has been demonstrated for the @xmath5 case by bogner _",
    "thus we can concentrate on features of the @xmath4 interaction relevant to low - energy experimental hypernuclear observables .",
    "first we have presented the @xmath5 results for the sake of the comparison .",
    "the quark model potential gives almost the same results as other modern realistic @xmath5 potentials , as it should .",
    "the @xmath0 equivalent interaction in the low - momentum space turns out to be almost identical in the quark model and the obep model .",
    "this is probably because we have some amount of constraints from @xmath67 hypernuclear data in addition to old scattering data .    experimental data for the @xmath1 interaction",
    "is very limited .",
    "thus the model dependence in the theoretical construction of the @xmath1 potential is large .",
    "in fact , the quark model and the nijmegen obep model provide different equivalent interactions in the low - momentum space .",
    "in particular , we note that the the quark model predicts repulsion in the @xmath65 @xmath70 state which originates from the pauli effect on the quark level , while the nsc97f potential expects attraction . on the other hand",
    "the repulsive contribution of nsc97f in the @xmath64 @xmath80 state is rather strong .",
    "the @xmath2 interaction is less known experimentally .",
    "this subject is one of the primary subjects of the on - going j - parc project @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements in the low - momentum space from the quark model potential suggests that the @xmath83-nucleus s.p .",
    "potential is probably attractive due to the interaction in the @xmath64 state in the isospin @xmath90 channel , but weak .",
    "it is expected that there are strong baryon - channel coupling effects both in the high - momentum space and in the low - momentum space . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider higher partial waves .",
    "actually they may be important for the quantitative discussion of the @xmath83 hyperon in nuclear medium .",
    "these are the future subjects to study .    in hyperon - nucleon interactions ,",
    "baryon - channel couplings appear in most cases .",
    "if the coupling effect is important , as in the case of the @xmath1 @xmath65 @xmath80 state in the nijmegen nsc97f model and the @xmath2 @xmath64 @xmath66 state in the quark model , we have to solve the channel - coupling problem in the low - momentum space in order to obtain physically meaningful quantities . when considering hyperons in nuclear medium , we also have to take into account the pauli exclusion effect on the hadron level in a nuclear many body system .",
    "the effect of the three - body correlation through the coupling of the pauli effect and the elimination of the high momentum components of the interaction may be important for hyperons in nuclear medium .",
