    "laser - generated attosecond extreme - ultraviolet ( xuv ) pulses are of great interest as a powerful tool for a number of potential applications , including exploring novel ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented temporal resolution@xcite , investigating nonlinear optics in the xuv region@xcite , and as a probe for laser - plasma interactions@xcite .",
    "a promising approach to generate such xuv sources is high - order harmonics generation ( hhg ) from relativistic laser - irradiated overdense plasma surfaces@xcite , which holds the potential and advantage to obtain xuv pulses with high brilliance .",
    "several radiation mechanisms have been identified , such as coherent wake emission ( cwe)@xcite , relativistic oscillating mirror ( rom)@xcite , and coherent synchrotron emission ( cse)@xcite . while cwe predominates at moderate laser intensities , i.e.",
    ", the laser normalized vector potential @xmath0 , rom and cse are more efficient for highly relativistic laser intensities with @xmath1 .",
    "so far , these mechanisms are well understood , and quite good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experiments has been achieved@xcite .    in addition to hhg in the direction of laser reflection , transmitted xuv emission from the rear target surface have also been found , which is of interest for diagnostics to determine the maximum plasma density .",
    "compared to the reflected hhg pulses , it also has the advantage of being used directly and not subject to additional energy loss due to further spectral filtering .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed@xcite , including line emission at twice of the plasma frequency due to inverse two - plasmon decay@xcite , and emissions explained in the contexts of the cwe and cse@xcite .",
    "the analysis and demonstration of the above hhg mechanisms have greatly enhanced our understanding of the physics of laser solids interactions and xuv generation processes from solids surfaces@xcite .    in this paper , we report a new mechanism of ultrafast xuv pulse generation from laser - irradiated plasma surfaces in the wavebreaking regime .",
    "the attosecond xuv pulse is generated from the front layer of the plasma and then propagates through the foil target , with frequencies mainly around the local plasma frequency . through simulations and analysis , we identify the underlying physics is predominately due to the strong plasma - density oscillation in the surface layer subsequent to wavebreaking , which we call _ wavebreaking - associated transmitted emission _ ( wte ) .",
    "we also show that the emission is a general process for a wide range of laser and plasma parameters in the wavebreaking regime .",
    "besides offering a new option to generate ultrafast xuv pulses , the radiation process identified here also provides important insights into the mechanism of xuv generation and the dynamics of laser - plasma interactions .",
    "both one - dimensional ( 1d ) and 2d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations are carried out using the virtual laser plasma lab ( vlpl ) code@xcite .",
    "we firstly present the 1d results to investigate the radiation mechanism in detail . here",
    ", we demonstrate the basic idea mainly by considering the simplest configuration of normal laser incidence and step plasma density profile . as such",
    ", this mechanism can be pointed out most clearly since it is easily distinguished from the other mechanisms .",
    "for example , cwe can not play a role with this geometry , because it requires oblique laser incidence and short density gradient@xcite .",
    "besides , the emission can not simply be attributed to rom either , because rom only occurs in the reflection direction@xcite .",
    "the incident laser is linearly polarized in @xmath2-direction , with a gaussian temporal profile @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the normalized laser amplitude with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the laser field amplitude and the laser frequency respectively , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are respectively the electron mass , the elementary charge and the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath10 is the pulse duration with @xmath11 the laser pulse duration . here for simplicity we firstly consider this quasi - single - cycle pulse .",
    "the effect of multi - cycle laser pulses will be discussed in section 5.2 . the fully ionized plasma , with a thickness of @xmath12=120 nm and an electron density of @xmath13 , is initially located between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16= 800 nm is the laser wavelength , @xmath17 is the critical plasma density .",
    "the ions are assumed to be immobile due to the short interaction time being considered .",

    "the emitted pulse has the same polarization with the laser pulse , i.e. , only with electric field along @xmath21-direction .",
    "this is different from cwe , which emits @xmath22-polarized hhg even for a @xmath2-polarized obliquely incidence laser@xcite .",
    "the peak electric field is only about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the laser field .",
    "the transmitted xuv emission is strong .",

    "we select the case of @xmath19 for demonstration , since the basic features of radiation and the interaction dynamics are similar for both cases , as can be seen from the supplemental movies sm1 and sm2@xcite .    we start with discussing the possible origins of high - frequency emission based on the expression for total transverse current leading to the transverse radiation field . considering a more general case of laser at oblique incidence with an angle of @xmath31 , the expression for the radiation source , i.e. , the total transverse current @xmath32 ,",

    "this is the source term responsible for the cwe mechanism@xcite .",
    "it can emit radiation directly from the plasma oscillation @xmath39 , without the need to couple with the transverse laser field .",
    "this is obviously not the case in our scheme where @xmath40 and the emission is in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "in addition to requiring oblique incidence , cwe is only possible in the presence of a density gradient , since its mechanism is basically the inverse process of resonance absorption .    under the condition of laser field @xmath41 at normal incidence with @xmath40 , the total transverse current is recast to be @xmath42 in this case ,",
    "high frequencies can be introduced by temporal modulation of the effective plasma density @xmath43 and the vector potential @xmath44 , and doppler upshifting effect .",
    "the rom mechanism is dominated by the doppler upshifting effect , and thus can only occur in the reflected direction@xcite . in the following ,",

[ ne_ps](d ) ) , also indicating the onset of a multi - stream motion in the phase space - _ signatures _ of wavebreaking@xcite . for initially cold plasma",

    "the electrons , which start to move in the negative direction at the beginning of the second half laser period , largely affect the following plasma oscillation .",
    "they represent the electron boundary after crossing over the electrons moving to the right .",
    "afterwards , the laser ponderomotive force dominates and it reverses the boundary electrons ( see fig .",
    "[ ne_ps](e ) ) . at the same time , the other electron bunches move further inside the plasma .",
    "this leads to the density profile largely different from that of half laser period ago when no wavebreaking occurs ( see fig .",
    "[ ne_ps](a ) ) . in the case of without wavebreaking , @xmath74 decreases exponentially in the surface layer after reaching its maximum , while in the case of wavebreaking the electric field decays much slowly ( see fig .",
    "[ ne_ps](e ) ) . as a result ,",
    "the electrostatic force starts to dominate in the surface layer ( see the total force ) and consequently the electrons in this area start to move in the negative direction . at the same time , the electrons near the boundary still move in the positive direction , so a second sharp density spike is expected ( see fig .",
    "[ ne_ps](f ) ) .",
    "this process repeats several times that several periods of density oscillation can be expected .    from the point of view of wavebreaking ,",
    "a direct consequence of wavebreaking is a large number of formerly nonresonant main body electrons can rapidly exchange energy with the plasma wave and acquire momenta efficiently . in other words , wavebreaking implies a considerable fraction of the plasma electrons are trapped and start oscillating .",
    "this leads to a greatly increased plasma fluctuation level .",

    "the electron density oscillation can reach such a high level that allows this kind of emission efficiently generated .",
    "it is also seen from the radiation source term in equation ( [ eq : wite ] ) that the temporal variation of @xmath43 is mainly responsible for the high - frequency xuv emission , since the laser field changes on a much longer time scale than the plasma oscillation assuming @xmath88 .",
    "these demonstrate the strong density oscillation subsequent to wavebreaking indeed plays a dominant role in the emission process .",
    "this is why we call this radiation  wavebreaking - associated transmitted emission .",
    "the density variation itself , though playing a dominate role in the emission process , does not fully determine the radiation properties .",

    "we can also analyze how the retarded current density oscillation evolves with time and how it corresponds to each value of the transmitted field . from the green line in fig .",
    "[ ret_j](b ) , we can see that at time @xmath98 , the left boundary of the current profile reverses its moving direction and starts to move to the right .",

    "accordingly , the transmitted field reaches another local maximum(see fig .",
    "[ ret_j](c ) ) . obviously , this behavior of the retarded current corresponds to the plasma - density oscillation we discussed above .",
    "the density oscillation leads to a fast variation of the total current and thus gives rise to radiation at higher frequencies that can propagate through the plasma .      to enable the transmitted emission",
    "propagate through the plasma slab , the plasma should locally support higher frequency oscillations which then couple to the transverse electric fields . here",
    "we give a simple model to show in principle it is possible for the local plasma frequency to be higher than the background plasma frequency due to density compression effect .",
    "let us consider the local plasma frequency at the laser - plasma interface .",
    "let the plasma be overdense with @xmath100 .",

    "electrons oscillate transversely in the laser field at the laser frequency with the normalized momentum @xmath102 .",
    "the ponderomotive force is @xmath103@xcite , where the gamma factor @xmath104 .",
    "the ponderomotive force compresses electron density within the skin depth .",

    "thus , together with the electron - density compression and the acquired relativistic @xmath79-factor of electrons , the local plasma frequency changes as well .",
    "it can be obtained from the equation of motion @xmath109 and the maxwell s equation @xmath110@xcite , where @xmath111 is the electric field , so that the local plasma frequency is @xmath112 where @xmath113 . because the local plasma frequency has a strong spatial dispersion , plasma waves excited in this region break easily .",
    "the change in the plasma frequency has two sources : electron density compression and increase of the electron relativistic @xmath79-factor .",

    "considering within the skin layer the field amplitude can be small , we can write @xmath116 . to proceed further ,",
    "since @xmath117 appears in the expression for @xmath118 , let us firstly find the zeroth - order approximation of @xmath119 near the position @xmath115 .",
    "now the @xmath79-factor is constant and its derivative vanishes",

    "thus , the local plasma oscillations can excite electromagnetic waves at frequencies above the background plasma frequency .",
    "these waves can propagate through the plasma slab and exit from the rear side of the target .",

    "the other parameters are the same with the case of @xmath27 in the above simulations .",
    "it is seen that a train of attosecond xuv pulses have been generated .",
    "the frequency spectrum contains finer structures than that in fig .",
    "[ xuv_tf](b ) , as a result of the interference between different pulses in the attosecond pulse train .",
    "the effect of interference is more evident with a longer duration pulse of 30 fs , as shown in figs .",
    "[ mul - cycle](c)-(d ) .",
    "frequency components below @xmath140 can be attributed to a lowered plasma frequency of the relativistically heated foil . using techniques such as polarization gating",
    ", an isolated attosecond xuv pulse may be obtained .",

    "the other parameters are the same with that in fig .",
    "[ xuv_tf](a).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    since the wte process relies on the strong plasma - density oscillation subsequent to wavebreaking , a finite density ramp in the front of the plasma surface will affect the threshold of wavebreaking and thus the temporal and spectral structures of the wte .",
    "from the cold nonrelativistic wavebreaking field @xmath145 , which is dependent on the plasma frequency and thus the plasma density , we see that a density ramp can lower the wavebreaking threshold .",
    "consequently , the presence of a pre - plasma allows the wte to occur more easily .",
    "this can be seen by considering a longer plasma gradient length .",
    "figure  [ pr_t](a ) shows the temporal profile of the wte for the case of an exponential plasma density gradient with scale length @xmath141 .",
    "the emitted pulse lasts a longer time of several femtoseconds , compared with the case of without pre - plasma in fig .",
    "[ xuv_tf](a ) .",
    "this is due to an earlier wavebreaking and the subsequent strong density oscillation when the laser pulses interact with the density ramp in the front of the target , as shown in figs .",
    "[ pr_t](c)-(d ) .",
    "we can see the multi - stream motion of electrons from the phase space distribution ( @xmath142 ) , indicating the wavebreaking has occurred ( see fig .",

    ", the profile of the transverse field @xmath41 shows the waveform with higher frequencies ( see fig .",

    "the duration of the emitted pulse is shorter for the case of a shorter scale length of @xmath144 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ pr_t](b ) .",
    "the results obtained so far are based on the 1d case .",
    "we also performed 2d simulations to check whether this mechanism works in multidimensional cases .",

    "the other laser and plasma parameters are the same with those used in fig .",
    "[ xuv_tf](a)-(b ) in the 1d simulations , except that the laser pulse has a gaussian transverse profile with a focal spot size of @xmath147 .",
    "figure  [ 2d](a ) shows a snapshot of the transverse electric field distribution at time @xmath148 .",
    "we see that an ultrashort pulse is generated at the rear side of the target . figures  [ 2d](b)-(c ) show the temporal profiles and the corresponding frequency spectra of the transmitted emission observed at the position ( x=6@xmath146 , y=0 ) at the rear target side , respectively .",
    "the signatures of both the temporal waveform and frequency spectrum are in good agreement with the 1d simulation results .",
    "an animated demonstration of the laser - plasma dynamics similar with the 1d case can be seen in movie sm3 in the supplemental material@xcite .",
    "the density spike indicating the onset of wavebreaking at @xmath149 and the subsequent transmitted emission at later times can be clearly seen from the movie . as for the concern of transverse instabilities",
    ", we note that experiments of femtosecond - picosecond laser interaction with nanometer - micrometer thin target are routinely available nowadays .",
    "a number of experiments have been carried out using similar parameters with ours .",
    "for example , experiments of a much longer pulse laser of 500 fs duration ( @xmath150 ) interacting with thin targets of thickness 125 - 200 nm have successfully demonstrated the transmitted emission due to the cse mechanism@xcite .",
    "these results indicate the transverse instabilities are not fatal with the parameters we considered here .",
    "in conclusion , a new regime of attosecond xuv pulses generation from overdense plasma surfaces , namely , wavebreaking - associated transmitted emission ( wte ) , has been demonstrated .",
    "the emission originates from the plasma front surface and propagates through the target , with frequencies mainly around the local plasma frequencies .",
    "the underlying physics can be attributed to the coupling of the transverse fields in the skin layer and the strong plasma - density oscillation subsequent to wavebreaking .",
    "thus the emission is evident only in the wavebreaking regime .",
    "this novel scenario of ultrafast xuv pulse emission from overdense plasmas provides new insights into the dynamics of laser - plasma interactions and the physics of radiation process .",
