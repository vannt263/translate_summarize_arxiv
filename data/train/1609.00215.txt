    "the @xmath0 topology on the skorokhod space @xmath2)$ ] of cdlg functions has emerged as a result of chain of observations made in eighties and nineties of the twentieth century .    in 1984",
    "meyer and zheng @xcite considered certain conditions on truncated variations of stochastic processes and proved that these conditions give uniform tightness of the processes in some topology ( nowadays called the meyer - zheng topology ) on @xmath3 .",
    "a year later stricker @xcite proved that it is possible to relax meyer - zheng conditions to uniform tightness of random variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for each pair of levels @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the number of up - crossings of levels @xmath8 ) .",
    "stricker still operated with the meyer - zheng topology .",
    "it was clear for kurtz @xcite that such conditions give much more .",
    "but an _ ad hoc _ device constructed by kurtz _ did not have a topological character_.    the @xmath0 topology was constructed by the author in @xcite .",
    "this step was final in the sense that stricker s conditions are _ equivalent _ to the uniform tightness in the @xmath0 topology",
    ".    it should be emphasized , that the @xmath0 topology , as considered in @xcite , is sequential and it is still not known if it is completely regular .",
    "so at the moment of its creation there was no formalism to deal with it within the probability theory .",
    "such formalism has been provided in @xcite . and an efficient tool - the almost sure skorokhod s representation in non - metric spaces , given in @xcite - made the @xmath0 topology an operational and useful device in many problems .",
    "the very first application of the @xmath0 topology was given by the author in @xcite , where convergence of stochastic integrals was considered .",
    "later the @xmath0 topology was used in problems related to homogenization of stochastic differential equations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite ) , diffusion approximation of solutions to the poisson equation ( @xcite ) , skorokhod problem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , econometrics ( @xcite ) , control theory ( @xcite , @xcite ) , linear models with heavy - tails ( @xcite ) , continuity of semilinear neumann - dirichlet problems ( @xcite ) , generalized doob - meyer decomposition ( @xcite ) , modeling stochastic reaction networks ( @xcite ) and even in some considerations of more general character ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we provide some complementary information related to the @xmath0 topology .",
    "section 2 restates the definition and basic properties of the @xmath0 topology .",
    "the @xmath0 topology was defined in @xcite by means of so - called @xmath9-convergence @xmath10 , which leads to the topological convergence @xmath11 via the kantorovich - vulih - pinsker - kisynski recipe ( we refer to section [ appendix ] for a primer on sequential spaces ) . in section [ seccompact ]",
    "we provide a compact formula for the @xmath11 convergence .",
    "in section [ sechier ] we find a position for @xmath0 in the hierarchy of topologies on @xmath3 , by showing that it is _ essentially _ finer than any linear topology which is coarser than the skorokhod s @xmath1 topology .",
