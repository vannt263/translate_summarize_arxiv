    "the deregulation of energy markets has given rise to various families of contracts .",
    "many of them appear as some derivative products whose underlying is some tradable futures ( day - ahead , etc ) on gas or electricity ( see  @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "the class of swing options has been paid a special attention in the literature , because it includes many of these derivative products . a common feature to all these options is that they introduce some risk sharing between a producer and a trader , of gas or electricity for example . from a probabilistic viewpoint",
    ", they appear as some stochastic control problems modeling multiple optimal stopping problems ( the control variable is the purchased quantity of energy ) ; see @xmath0  @xcite in a continuous time setting . gas storage contracts ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ) or electricity supply agreements ( see  @xcite , @xcite ) are examples of such swing options .",
    "indeed , energy supply contracts are one simple and important example of such swing options that will be deeply investigated in this paper ( see below , see also  @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this kind of contracts are slightly different from multiple exercises american options as considered in  @xcite for example . in our setting the volumetric constraints play a key role and thus , the flexibility is not restricted to time decisions , but also has to take into account volumes management .",
    "designing efficient numerical procedures for the pricing of swing option contracts remains a very challenging question as can be expected from a possibly multi - dimensional stochastic control problem subject to various constraints ( due to the physical properties of the assets like in storage contracts ) .",
    "most recent approaches developed in mathematical finance , especially for the pricing of american options , have been adapted and transposed to the swing framework : tree ( or  forest \" ) algorithms in the pioneering work  @xcite , least squares regression mc methods ( see  @xcite ) , pde s numerical methods ( finite elements , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to deeply investigate an old question , namely to elucidate the structure of the optimal control in supply contracts ( with firm constraints ) and how it impacts the numerical methods of pricing",
    ". we will provide in a quite general ( and abstract ) setting some  natural \" ( and simple ) conditions involving the local and global purchased volume constraints to ensure the existence of _ bang - bang optimal strategy _",
    "( such controls usually do not exist ) .",
    "it is possible to design _ a priori _ the contract so that their parameters satisfy these conditions . to our knowledge",
    "very few theoretical results have been established so far on this problem ( see however  @xcite in a markovian framework for contracts with penalized constraints and  @xcite , also in a markovian framework ) .",
    "this first result of the paper not only enlightens the understanding of the management of a swing contract : it also has some deep repercussions on the numerical methods to price it . as a matter of fact , taking advantage of the existence of a bang - bang optimal strategy , we propose and analyze in details ( when the underlying asset has a markovian dynamics ) a quantized dynamic programming procedure to price any swing options whose volume constraints satisfy the  bang - bang \" assumption .",
    "furthermore some _ a priori _ error bounds are established .",
    "this procedure turns out to be dramatically efficient , as emphasized in the companion paper  @xcite where the method is extensively tested with assets having multi - factor gaussian underlying dynamics and compared to the least squares regression method .",

    "this amount of energy is subject to some lower and upper  local \" constraints .",
    "the total amount of energy purchased at the end of the contract is also subject to a  global \" constraint .",
    "given dynamics on the energy price process , the problem is to evaluate the price of such a contract , at time @xmath1 when it is emitted and during its whole life up to its maturity .    to be precise , the owner of the contract is allowed to purchase at times @xmath2 , @xmath3 a quantity @xmath4 of energy at a unitary _ strike price _ @xmath5 . at every date @xmath2 ,",
    "the purchased quantity @xmath4 is subject to the firm _  local \" constraint _ , @xmath6 whereas the global purchased quantity @xmath7 is subject to the ( firm ) global constraint @xmath8\\qquad ( 0<q_{\\min } \\le q_{\\max}<+\\infty).\\ ] ]    the strike price process @xmath9 can be either deterministic ( even constant ) or stochastic , @xmath0 indexed on past values of other commodities ( oil , etc ) .",
    "usually , on energy markets the price is known through future contracts @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the price at time @xmath12 of the forward contract delivered at maturity @xmath13 .",
    "the available data at time @xmath14 are @xmath15 ( in real markets this is of course not a continuum ) .",
    "the underlying asset price process , temporarily denoted @xmath16 , is often the so - called  day - ahead \" contract @xmath17 which is a tradable instrument or the spot price @xmath18 which is not .",
    "all the decisions about the contract need to be adapted to the filtration of @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath3 ( with @xmath22 ) .",
    "this means that the price of such a contract is given at any time @xmath23 , by @xmath24,j = k,\\ldots , n-1 , \\sum_{j = k}^{n-1}q_j\\!\\in [ q^k_{\\min } , q^k_{\\max}]\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 denote the _ residual global constraints _ and @xmath27 denotes the ( deterministic ) interest rate .",
    "this pricing problem clearly appears as a stochastic control problem .    in the pioneering work by  @xcite ,",
    "this type of contract was computed by using some forests of ( multinomial ) trees .",
    "a natural variant , at least for numerical purpose , is to consider a penalized version of this stochastic control .",
    "thus , in  @xcite , a penalization @xmath28 with @xmath29 is added ( @xmath30 is negative outside @xmath31 $ ] and zero inside ) .    as concerns more sophisticated contracts ( like storages ) ,",
    "the holder of the contract receive a quantity @xmath32 when deciding @xmath33 . when dealing with gas this is due to the storing constraints since injecting or withdrawing gas from its storing units induce fixed costs ( and physical constraints ( pressure , etc ) ) .",
    "as concerns the underlying asset dynamics , it is commonly shared in finance to assume that the traded asset has a markovian dynamics ( or is a component of a markov process like with stochastic volatility models ) .",
    "the dynamics of physical assets for many reasons ( some of them simply coming from history ) are often modeled using some more deeply non - markovian models like long memory processes , etc .",
    "all these specific features of energy derivatives suggest to tackle the above pricing problem in a rather general framework , trying to avoid as long as possible to call upon markov properties .",
    "this is what we do in the first part of the paper where the general setting of a swing option defined by an abstract sequence of @xmath34-adapted payoffs is deeply investigated as a function of its global constraints @xmath35 ( when the local constraints are normalized @xmath20 @xmath33 is @xmath36$]-valued for every @xmath37 ) .",
    "we show that this premium is a concave , piecewise affine , function of the global constraints , affine on triangles of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we also show that for integral valued global constraints , the optimal controls are always bang - bang @xmath20 the _ a priori _ @xmath36$]-valued optimal purchased quantities @xmath44 are in fact always equal to @xmath14 or @xmath45 .",
    "such a result can be extended in some way to any couple of global constraints when all the payoffs are nonnegative .",
    "then , when there is an underlying markov  structure process \" , we propose an optimal quantization based on numerical approach to price efficiently swing options .",
    "this markov  structure process \" can be the underlying traded asset itself or a higher dimensional hidden markov process : such a framework comes out in case of multi - factor processes having some long - memory properties .",
    "optimal quantization was first introduced as a numerical method to solve nonlinear problem arising in mathematical finance in a series of papers  @xcite devoted to the pricing and hedging of american style multi - asset options .",
    "it has also been applied to stochastic control problem , namely portfolio optimization in  @xcite .",
    "the purely numerical aspects induced by optimal quantization , with a special emphasis on the gaussian distribution , have been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for a survey on numerical application of optimal quantization to finance . for other applications",
    "( to automatic classification , clustering , etc ) , see also  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a quantized backward dynamic programming to approximate the premium of a swing contract .",
    "we analyze the rate of convergence of this algorithm and provide some _ a priori _ error bounds in terms of quantization errors .",
    "we illustrate the method by computing the whole graph of the premium viewed as a function of the global constraints , combining the affine property of the premium and the quantized algorithm in  toy model \" : the future prices of gas are modeled by a two factor gaussian model .",
    "an extensive study of the pricing method by optimal quantization is carried out from both a theoretical and numerical point of view in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "below we detail the decomposition of swing options into a swap contract and a normalized swing option . in section  [ abstractswing ] ,",
    "we precisely describe our abstract setting for normalized swing options with firm constraints and the variable of interest ( global constraints , local constraints , etc ) . in section  [ progdynabst ]",
    ", we establish the dynamic programming formula satisfied in full generality by the premium as a function of the global constraints ( this unifies the similar results obtained in markov settings , see  @xcite ,  @xcite , etc ) and we show this is a concave function with respect to the global constraints .",
    "then , in section  [ piecaffine ] , we prove in our abstract framework that the premium function is piecewise affine and that the optimal purchased quantities satisfy a  @xmath14-@xmath45 \" or bang - bang principle ( theorem  [ main ] ) .",
    "a special attention is paid to the @xmath46-period model which provides an intuitive interpretation of the results . in section  [ swingquant ] , after some short background on quantization and its optimization , we propose a quantization based backward dynamic programming formula as a numerical method to solve the swing pricing problem .",
    "then we provide some error bounds for the procedure depending on the quantization error induced by the quantization of the markov structure process .",
