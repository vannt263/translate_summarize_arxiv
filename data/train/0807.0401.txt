    "in cosmology , one models the evolution and observables associated with an inhomogeneous universe of density @xmath0 and expansion rate @xmath1 by employing a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) homogeneous / isotropic model of density @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes some suitably defined spatial average .",
    "one then assumes that the expansion rate and cosmological observables are those obtained in the corresponding flrw model .",
    "one of the proposals to explain `` dark energy '' calls into question this long - standing ( 86-year ) procedure .",
    "the idea is that the expansion rate and cosmological observables of a suitably inhomogeneous universe containing only dust , if analyzed within the framework of a homogeneous model , seems to behave as if the stress tensor also contains a fictitious negative - pressure fluid ( _ i.e. , _ dark energy ) .",
    "although this proposal is conservative in the sense that it does not involve a cosmological constant of incredibly small magnitude ( presumably rationalized on some anthropic basis ) , a scalar field of unbelievably small mass , or an entirely unmotivated modification of general relativity , it is rather revolutionary because it implies that there is no dark energy and the expansion of the universe does not actually accelerate ( at least , not in the usual sense ) .    at present , the idea that the backreaction of inhomogeneities accounts for the observational evidence usually attributed to dark energy is more of a concept than a predictive model .",
    "however , it is generally agreed that if the proposal is to be relevant , nonlinearities are required",
    ".    there have been many criticisms of this approach .",
    "one of them @xcite is based on the claim that even in the presence of highly nonlinear density perturbations ( @xmath4 ) the metric for our universe can everywhere be written as a perturbed conformal newtonian metric of the form ) , satisfying the stated conditions , as the _ perturbed conformal newtonian _ metric . ]",

    "the usual statement is that in the dust case one is allowed to use the perturbed conformal newtonian metric either in the linear regime ( _ i.e. , _ perturbations of every quantity being small ) or in the weak - field ( newtonian ) regime .",
    "the claim is that if the metric can be written in the above form and satisfies the above conditions , even in the presence of large inhomogeneities , any cosmological observable will be the same as the cosmological observable calculated with @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. , _ in the homogeneous / isotropic model .",
    "this has been described as a `` no - go '' theorem that backreactions can not _ in principle _",
    "account for the observations .",
    "while it is impossible to consider the most general inhomogeneous solutions , there are spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust solutions , which are not perturbations of einstein - de sitter , that can be constructed to give observables similar to @xmath14cdm models .",
    "these models serve as a counterexample to the no - go argument . in this paper",
    "we will show why these models can not be described in terms of a conformal newtonian metric perturbed about a spatially flat background , and attempt to understand the implications for the backreaction proposal .    indeed , while it may turn out that backreactions are not the answer",
    ", we argue that assuming the results of measurements of the luminosity distance as a function of redshift usually interpreted as an accelerated expansion , the metric describing our universe can not be written in the form of a perturbed conformal newtonian metric where @xmath15 is calculated from the homogeneous dust model . in other words , if the expansion history of the universe is well described by the @xmath14cdm model , then perturbing about an einstein - de sitter model by the perturbed conformal newtonian metric of eq .",
    "( [ newtpert ] ) is inappropriate , because einstein - de sitter would be the wrong background .",
    "this is because of large peculiar velocities with respect to the background einstein - de sitter space .",
    "so if inhomogeneities are responsible for the observables usually attributed to dark energy , the universe can not be obtained by small perturbations of the einstein - de sttter model . in other words ,",
    "the reason we interpret the observations as evidence for dark energy and acceleration of the universe is that we are comparing the observables to observables computed in the wrong background .",
    "as we will discuss , the reason is that the proper meaning of `` peculiar '' is `` after subtraction of a background hubble flow term . ''",
    "we will argue that large peculiar velocities must be present if the backreaction program works , and the peculiar velocities are not related to `` local '' departures from the hubble flow that would show up as large velocity dispersions .    as an explicit example , consider the argument of ref .",
    "they propose that the backreaction of inhomogeneities in a dust universe modifies the evolution of the effective volume - averaged scale factor and results in an evolution of the volume expansion that resembles a @xmath14cdm model , rather than the unperturbed spatially flat dust model .",
    "if one would write the metric for such a perturbed universe in terms of a perturbed conformal newtonian metric , then one would have to use @xmath15 described by a @xmath14cdm model , _ not _ the @xmath15 from an unperturbed spatially flat dust model .",
    "if one would attempt to express the metric in terms of a perturbed metric with @xmath15 described by a spatially flat dust model , then there would be enormous peculiar velocities in the hubble flow .",
    "we explore the issue by considering the spacetime of a particular lematre - tolman - bondi spherically symmetric model . in the model",
    "we study , the observer is centered in a large ( gpc ) underdense region in an asymptotically einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "this model has large , but not highly nonlinear , density and curvature inhomogeneities .",
    "we show by explicit calculation that the metric _ can not _ be expressed as a perturbed conformal newtonian metric during the entire evolution .",
    "we also show that the reason for this can be traced to large peculiar velocities that develop with respect to the einstein - de sitter background .    in the next section",
    "we describe the relevant features of the einstein - de sitter and lematre - tolman - bondi models . in section [ ltbpg ]",
    "we develop the formalism to express the original lematre - tolman - bondi metric in the form of a perturbed conformal poisson metric . in section [ discussion ] we discuss the reason for the numerical results of the previous section .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we will establish the notation for the homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially - flat cosmological model ( the einstein  de sitter model ) .",
    "we will then briefly introduce the formalism of ltb spherically symmetric cosmological models in the synchronous gauge , and turn to a particular ltb model with values of cosmological observables similar to the @xmath14cdm model .",

    "a negative ( positive ) value corresponds to a radial velocity towards ( away from ) the center .",
    "[ ur ] , width=604 ]    we now turn to the discussion .",
    "the linear gauge transformation we have performed in the previous section is a useful tool to understand where and why the no - go argument discussed in the introduction fails . in this section , first we will introduce the _ general _ physical cause of the breakdown of the description by means of the perturbed conformal poisson metric",
    ". then we will show how this general feature shows up in the model here examined .",
    "finally we will conclude the section with some comments about other models developed in the literature .",
    "the description by means of the perturbed conformal poisson metric breaks down because of the large @xmath222 in the aag model . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ h ] , @xmath223 is of order unity .",
    "a large @xmath222 is a typical feature of models with inhomogeneities , and from this point of view we think the ltb model is a useful tool to study the consequences of the evolution of structures in the real universe . in particular , the aag version allows us to follow the evolution of the inhomogeneities for a rather large time span , thanks to the large initial infall velocity of the shells ( negative value of @xmath224 for @xmath56 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ h ] ) .     for the indicated values of @xmath91 .",
    "[ h ] , width=604 ]    a different expansion rate means a different flrw solution , and even if the initial @xmath222 is small , the two solutions ( void and eds ) will eventually follow very different evolutions .",
    "what we have in mind is the comparison of a background flrw solution in the underdensity ( the void region ) and in the flrw solution at large @xmath78 .",
    "we will denote the value of @xmath78 beyond which the solution is approximately eds as @xmath80 .",
    "we make the point that these two patches have different backgrounds , even though the `` average '' background _ is _ the eds solution .",
    "the aag model can indeed be thought of as an exact swiss - cheese model matched to the density and the ( zero ) curvature of the eds solution at a sufficiently large radius ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "we can imagine populating the universe with other holes of radius @xmath226 . on scales larger than any spherical hole",
    ", the aag model evolves as the eds model . from this perspective , in the framework developed by buchert @xcite , the backreaction of the inhomogeneities is zero .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion . ) here , we find a lack of a global background in spite of the absence of a volume backreaction .",
    "it can happen that at some specific time the background of the void patch is close to the eds solution .",
    "this will be , however , a special moment because of the different evolution of the two patches .",
    "it will be more typical to have a large departure from the eds flow , which will be manifest in a large @xmath222 or in large `` peculiar '' velocities .",
    "these `` peculiar '' velocities are the result of comparing the cosmic evolution of two different flrw solutions , or , in other words , the results of perturbing about the wrong background .    summarizing , _ an inhomogeneous universe featuring voids can not be studied by means of a global homogeneous background , and this holds even",
    "if the inhomogeneities do not affect , as it happens in a swiss - cheese model , the global evolution_.      what we have just discussed is clearly shown by the results obtained in the previous section . to understand them it is useful to focus on two key quantities .",
    "first , it is possible to show ( see the appendix [ quadro ] ) that the value of @xmath110 at the origin has the following time dependence : @xmath227 where @xmath228 describes the scale factor of the void region . in turn",
    ", this implies that @xmath229 .",
    "this expression makes clear that @xmath230 can be thought as the time integral of @xmath222 .",
    "a similar relation holds for @xmath154 ( see the appendix [ quadro ] ) : @xmath231 .",
    "this implies that @xmath232 , where we note that @xmath233 , the velocity of the comoving matter in the poisson frame shown in fig .",
    "[ ur ] , is , as expected , almost the same as the `` peculiar '' velocity of the comoving matter with respect to the eds background : @xmath234 where the last relation holds because , as we have seen , @xmath235 is of order unity .",
    "( we have also used the fact that @xmath26 is very close to unity . )    expressing these key - quantities as a function of @xmath222 , which is the source of the effects , will help us in understanding the results of the previous section .",
    "first , at early times ( @xmath236 ) `` peculiar '' velocities are larger than @xmath237 , as can be seen in fig .",
    ". the reason can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ pecp ] ) : at early times @xmath238 is indeed large .",
    "this highlights the usefulness of the aag model , which allows us to encompass both early times with a large expansion rate and the present time .",
    "this also illustrates the interesting fact that even with smaller @xmath222 we could have large peculiar velocities at early times when one might expect the system to be accurately described as a perturbation of an eds universe .",
    "these large velocities cause the potentials to be greater than unity and the perturbed conformal poisson metric to be unable to describe the metric in the void region . in the linear gauge transformation",
    "this shows up as the fact that peculiar velocities are of the same order as the gauge transformation .",
    "this is a general breakdown which affects the perturbed conformal poisson metric even if we perform a nonlinear gauge transformation @xcite",
    ".     evaluated at @xmath185 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath239 ( solid curve ) as a function of @xmath240 .",
    "[ nb ] , width=604 ]    at later times , velocities become order @xmath241 as can be seen from fig.[ur ] ; this is caused by the slowing down of the expansion . however , both @xmath242 and @xmath110 do not depend on @xmath222 , but rather on its time integral , or , in other words , on the different size of the void region compared to the eds region , that is , on @xmath243 .",
    "this dependence appears in @xmath110 because it is the spatial perturbation that has to connect these two differently expanding spatial regions .",
    "the reason for the breakdown of the linear transformation is , therefore , the growth of @xmath242 , that is , the departure of the two metrics .",
    "this shows up directly in @xmath110 .",
    "the basic problem is that the linear gauge transformation neglects terms like ( @xmath244 compared to terms like @xmath110 : see eq .",
    "( [ phitilde ] ) . as you can see from fig .",
    "[ nb ] , this approximation is no longer valid for @xmath245 .",
    "so even if the velocities are small , the linear transformation breaks down because their time - integrated effect is large . as a consequence",
    "we find , for example , @xmath186 .",
    "it is however possible to describe the late evolution of the model in the perturbed conformal newtonian metric by means of a nonlinear gauge transformation whose potential follows nonlinear equations of motion @xcite .",
    "we will comment now on the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to ref .",

    "@xcite does not deal with the possibility of using the perturbed conformal newtonian metric to describe the spacetime of the universe , but it will nevertheless help us to make our point because it is a model which can be described with the perturbed conformal newtonian metric if we perform a nonlinear gauge transformation .",
    "we start noting that in both ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite the validity of the perturbed conformal newtonian metric is assumed as a starting point .",
    "these particular models are not allowed to have large peculiar velocities .",
    "the point is that this is a particular choice , and , in our opinion , not general as demonstrated by the dependence in eq.([pecp ] ) of the peculiar velocities on @xmath222 .",
    "we would like to stress again that these `` background '' peculiar velocities have nothing to do with anything that can be measured as a local effect .",
    "therefore , the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite over - restrict the dynamics of the inhomogeneities , or , equivalently , demand the existence of a global background .",
    "for example , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial @xmath222 of eq .",
    "( [ pecp ] ) is exactly zero , and in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite it is @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , these models serve as an illustration to show the circular reasoning at the basis of the no - go argument : if we demand that the spacetime metric of the inhomogeneous universe has a global background without any departure due to differently evolving regions , then we will find the validity of the perturbed conformal newtonian metric .",
    "this is the main point of this work , and the linear gauge transformation is a useful tool to understand it .",
    "it is interesting to note that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can confront the sne data , but its luminosity distance does not show a big departure in shape from the eds one , while the aag model features a luminosity distance similar to the @xmath14cdm model .",
    "this is mainly due to the size of the hole , roughly @xmath189 times smaller than the aag one .",
    "we point out that if we want to have a @xmath14cdm - like luminosity distance in a setup with only one hole and the observer at the center , then we will likely have large background peculiar velocities .",
    "this might , however , be a typical , but not a general feature . to illustrate this",
    "we have calculated the luminosity distance for the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a hole roughly @xmath189 times larger : we found that @xmath247 always .",
    "this can be seen , again , as due to a restriction on the dynamics : allowing larger peculiar velocities we find voids with more general dynamics .",
    "we stress again the usefulness of the aag model in showing these general features .",
    "the ltb model analyzed in this paper is a very useful toy model to explore the role of large inhomogeneities in the determination of cosmological observables such as the luminosity distance as a function of redshift .",
    "we employed the toy model to demonstrate where and why the no - go argument discussed in the introduction fails . to this end",
    "we have performed a linear gauge transformation in order to understand the problems we have to face if we want to express the ltb model in the form of a perturbed conformal newtonian metric , eq.([newtpert ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that we regard the aag model as a tool useful to show a general feature needed to evade the no - go argument : we focused on the _ general _ physical cause of the nonlinear behavior of the aag model more than on its particular initial conditions .",
    "we came to the conclusion that the way the no - go argument is proved is by assuming , as a starting point , the validity of the argument itself .",
    "the way to escape the no - go argument is by allowing large `` background peculiar velocities , '' where these velocities have nothing to do with , _",
    "e.g. , _ velocity dispersions in clusters or anything that can be measured as a local effect .",
    "if indeed inhomogeneities are responsible for the `` apparent '' acceleration of the universe , then the evolution of the expansion rate must resemble a @xmath14cdm model . if that is true , then there will naturally be `` peculiar '' velocities if one describes the evolution in terms of perturbations of an eds model .",
    "one can not simply assume peculiar velocities are small and then use that as a basis to show inhomogeneities can have no effect .",
    "in the calculation of peculiar velocities it is necessary to specify a background solution about which to calculate velocities .",
    "the peculiar velocities can be small in the @xmath14cdm background but not in the eds background .",
    "the velocities appear as a departure from eds of the hubble flow , preventing the metric from being written in the conformal newtonian form .",
    "in other words , to evade the no - go argument we need to free the inhomogeneous models of dynamical restrictions ( small background peculiar velocities ) which impose the existence of a global background .    another way to see how the no - go argument of eq .",
    "( [ newtpert ] ) fails is through the equations of motion : in order to have a model , _",
    "e.g. , _ an ltb model , explain the observed departure of @xmath105 from the eds result requires nonlinear equations of motion , and this is because of the large background peculiar velocities which can generally occur . by this ,",
    "we mean that in order to end up with a large spatial variation of the background @xmath248 requires a nonlinear evolution like the one of the ltb model discussed in this paper . and",
    "this can occur even if it is possible , as in the aag model , to describe an inhomogeneous universe by means of the perturbed conformal newtonian metric from ( let s say ) @xmath249 to present time .",
    "this is shown here by explicit calculation .",
    "therefore , one must reconsider very carefully the statement that inhomogeneities can not have a significant effect on cosmological observables such as the luminosity distance as a function of redshift if arguments are based on the _ assumption _ that the metric describing our universe can be written in the perturbed conformal newtonian form of eq .",
    "( [ newtpert ] ) .",
    "now we enumerate some of our findings .    1 .   in the model we consider , even at late times",
    "when the density contrast is linear and the velocities are small , one can not express the ltb metric in the perturbed conformal newtonian form of eq .",
    "( [ newtpert ] ) by means of a linear gauge transformation .",
    "the breakdown of the linear transformation clearly shows the importance of background velocities .",
    "+ the linear gauge transformation breaks down mainly because of the large @xmath250 .",
    "this is caused by the different expansion rates ( @xmath251 ) of the void and the eds solution , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ h ] , which shows the expansion rates as a function of @xmath78 for several values of @xmath91 .",
    "the result is that the two metrics do not remain close enough for a linear transformation to connect them .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the basic problem is that the linear gauge transformation neglects terms like ( @xmath252 compared to terms like @xmath110 .",
    "summarizing , the cause of the break down of the linear gauge transformation is the large @xmath222 , and the underlying cause of that is the nonlinearity of the equations of motion .",
    "the failure described above can be stated as the fact that the linearized equations of motion work only for a limited range of times .",
    "2 .   it is possible to find a nonlinear gauge transformation to overcome this problem with a perturbed conformal newtonian metric description of the ltb metric whose potential follows nonlinear equations @xcite",
    ". these nonlinear equations ( which are actually the exact einstein equations ) at some time will typically give large potentials and make the perturbed conformal newtonian gauge description inconsistent ( large @xmath253 in the ltb model examined ) because at some point the peculiar velocities will be larger than @xmath237 if we do not restrict the dynamics , as shown by the aag model .",
    "although at the present time , in the model we consider , the magnitude of the potentials are small , they are not equal at the level of the linearized theory , _ viz .",
    "_  @xmath116 .",
    "this could navely be interpreted as some anisotropic stress or something else funny with the stress tensor .",
    "this is exactly the point that has been made in , _",
    "ref.@xcite : analyzing an inhomogeneous model in the framework of a homogeneous model introduces spurious components and behavior to the stress tensor ( _ possibly even a negative - pressure fluid ! _ ) .",
    "4 .   if we start with a perturbed eds model , then the growth of perturbations will lead to the formation of large voids , filamentary structure , and other nonlinearities .",
    "perhaps the ltb models are useful toy models to study the effect of that phenomenon .",
    "the model explored in this paper is a good example because it is capable of dealing with nonlinearities within a large timespan .",
    "finally , another point worth mentioning is the physical nature of super - hubble modes of @xmath110 and @xmath8 . at the initial time , within each hubble radius patch , @xmath110 and @xmath8 are very nearly constant , but possibly larger than one ( with a value of about @xmath254 near the origin ) .",
    "that _ does not _",
    "mean that we can simply subtract different values , because we are only allowed to do this once .",
    "if we do it at @xmath56 , then at @xmath255 we would have @xmath110 and @xmath8 near the origin of @xmath256 .",
    "summarizing , inhomogeneities , in particular voids not dynamically restricted , undermine the existence of a global background .",
    "the interesting question for future consideration is if backreactionscdm - like luminosity distance , then it is not straightforward to understand which category of backreaction ( weak or strong ) the model belongs to .",
    "the strong backreaction indeed is about a change of background , but this is also the case for the weak backreaction because , as in the case of this example , it `` defines '' an effective background , the @xmath14cdm model .",
