    "as far as the old kamland result @xcite was concerned , this was not guaranteed at all !    according to fig .",

    "this is due to the fact that , given the kamland sensitivity and baseline , matter effects are almost completely negligible ( rates differ by at most @xmath47 4% if matter effects are `` switched off '' @xcite ) , and @xmath48 yields almost as good a fit as @xmath49 . , meaning that the physical parameter space for neutrino oscillations is spanned by allowing @xmath50 $ ] . ]",

    "if we had a private communication showing that the dark side is excluded , then we would obtain a stronger constraint , @xmath80 .",

    "it is necessary to investigate electron - type antineutrino oscillations driven by the kamland @xmath56 and significantly affected by the presence of matter .",
    "an ideal setting for such an investigation seems to be provided by the emission of ( anti)neutrinos by type ii supernovae . for kamland - like values of @xmath56 , the electron - type antineutrino survival probability @xmath88 ( up to earth matter effects , which are non - negligible if the supernova neutrinos arrive at the detector site during the  night \" ) in the case of a normal antineutrino mass hierarchy or in the case of an inverted mass - hierarchy if @xmath89 @xcite",

    "it is not possible , given the ( rather optimistic ) uncertainties of the kamland parameters postulated above , to distinguish @xmath64 from @xmath104 at the one - sigma level , irrespective of how precisely @xmath106 is measured .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that , at these relatively short baselines , the matter effects do not have  distance to turn on , \" and both dark - side and light side parameters yield the same oscillation probability . for longer baselines ( like the bnl ",
    "homestake distance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pex](top ) ) , the situation is qualitatively different and @xmath106 depends strongly on whether @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "unfortunately , most of the effect is concentrated at very low energies due to the fact that for energies bigger than @xmath107 matter effects overwhelm the oscillation and suppress the mixing angle , independent of the value of @xmath64 . under optimistic assumptions , the bnl proposal claims to be able to observe around 20 @xmath108 events , where @xmath109 in the @xmath110 limit . ] with energy below 500  mev for similar oscillation parameters ( in the light side ) in a 500  kton water cherenkov detector assuming a 1  mw proton beam and @xmath111  seconds of data taking .",
    "this would , very roughly , translate into several @xmath112 events factor with respect to the neutrino one ( see @xcite and references therein ) . ] in the dark side , and a handful of events in the light side .",
    "to add insult to injury , @xmath113 is dependent on the atmospheric antineutrino mixing angle , whose uncertainty renders the experimental distinction between the light and dark sides even murkier .    an interesting possibility may be offered by  beta - beams , \" _",
    "i.e. _ , electron - type ( anti)neutrino beams produced by the decay of highly boosted , @xmath114-decay unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "if such a facility is ever built , one would have access to a very pure , high - energy ( @xmath115  mev ) @xmath116 beam  exactly what is needed in order to address the issue raised in this section .",
    "again , the challenge is to study the low - energy component of a typically higher average energy beam at very long baselines . as an example ,",
    "we very roughly estimate , using the beam characteristics and running time parameters of @xcite , that the an antineutrino beam generated via the decay of @xmath117 @xmath118he nuclei will yield around 50 unoscillated @xmath116induced events ( optimistic number ) with energy less than 400  mev in 500  kton  years of data collected 2540  km from the source , which translates into around 30 dark - side events or 40 light - side events assuming oscillation parameters consistent with the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : pex ] .",
    "hence , a marginal @xmath119 discrimination seems to be achievable .",
    "nonetheless , the situation here is still much more favorable than the one described above for a long - baseline superbeam setup , and seems to deserve further exploration .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have provided the first and , currently , only evidence for physics beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions . detailed analyses of neutrino data have lead to the conclusion that neutrinos have mass , and that leptons ( strongly ) mix . with the advent of more and more precise neutrino data",
    ", we should be able to probe whether there are more surprises lurking in the leptonic sector .",
    "the challenge is to separate the new physics from the already established flavor oscillation effects . here",
    "we explore the possibility of probing new physics ( beyond the standard model augmented by neutrino masses ) by comparing solar neutrino data with reactor antineutrino data .",
    "the key point is that , if there is new physics , the interpretation of both data sets in terms of two - flavor @xmath120 oscillations need not be consistent , _",
    "i.e. _ , the two experiments may select statistically distinct regions of the oscillation parameter space .",
    "we explore the issue of whether future kamland data can disagree with current solar data , without concentrating on a particular new physics scenario .",
    "we find that future kamland and the current solar data will be deemed consistent when interpreted in terms of two - flavor neutrino oscillations as long as future kamland data are consistent with the data analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this are : ( i ) the current kamland and solar data agree , and the future kamland data set will be of order a factor of two times the current one ( hence no big improvements are expected ) ; ( ii ) the regions of parameter space allowed by kamland and solar data are , in some loose sense , complementary , _ i.e. , _ kamland is very sensitive to @xmath60 but not particularly sensitive to @xmath61 , while the solar data are more sensitive to @xmath61 and less sensitive to @xmath60 ; ( iii ) future kamland data are not going to be able to discriminate , at more than the 99% confidence level , @xmath121  ev@xmath1 from @xmath122  ev@xmath1 . hence , even if the kamland data are consistent with , say , @xmath123  ev@xmath1 , we will not be able to claim , at more than the 99% confidence level , that the kamland region disagrees with the lma region , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ compare_9 ] .    among the `` new physics '' effects",
    "to which this analysis is potentially sensitive is three - flavor neutrino oscillations , including `` atmospheric '' driven oscillations with amplitudes proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "current bounds on @xmath124 @xcite , however , render @xmath124effects unobservable to a combined kamland plus solar analysis .",
    "since analyses of kamland and solar data in terms of two - flavor oscillations agree , we can limit new physics contributions . here , we illustrate this by binding cpt - violating effects , in particular the hypothesis that neutrinos and antineutrinos have different masses(-squared differences ) or mixing angles .",
    "we find that a comparison of kamland and solar data leads to the most severe bound on @xmath125 ( eq .  ( [ new_cpt_bound ] ) ) .",
    "this sort of analysis can also lead to very stringent bounds on specific forms of lorentz invariance violation @xcite .",
    "we also identify the challenge of binding another cpt - violating observable : @xmath126 .",
    "the main problem is that kamland is rather insensitive to matter effects , and can not tell whether the antineutrino mixing angle is on the light or dark side @xcite of the parameter space .",
    "we point out that this ambiguity can only be resolved with the help of other neutrino oscillation experiments  in particular long - baseline , @xmath127driven , antineutrino oscillations .",
    "it is not clear to us ( and is beyond the scope of this paper to pursue the issue in more detail ) whether any proposed long - baseline experiment can realistically differentiate @xmath64 from @xmath104 .",
    "there is a distinct probability that there is order one cpt violation in the neutrino sector , but we may not be able to verify it experimentally !    more sensitivity to new physics can be achieved if the solar data are also `` improved . ''",
    "new data from the sno experiment is expected to become available in the near future , and their analysis may result in a smaller lma region . qualitatively significant changes are expected if next - generation solar neutrino experiments , aimed at studying the low energy component of the solar neutrino flux ( pp and @xmath14be neutrinos ) , are built .",
    "the results of sec .  [ section : test ] can easily be contradicted if new solar neutrino experiments point to , say , a `` flatter '' than expected electron neutrino survival probability energy spectrum ( which , some will argue , seems to be hinted by the chlorine data and which could be interpreted as evidence of flavor changing neutrino interactions @xcite or a touch of active  sterile neutrino mixing @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , even if future solar data robustly confirm lma and kamland and solar data agree , a tighter constraint on @xmath53 can be obtained if the solar mass - squared difference is more tightly bound .    to conclude , neutrino experiments are sensitive to a plethora of new physics effects ( beyond neutrino masses ) , from the more `` mundane , '' like large neutrino magnetic moments , to the more `` exotic , '' like violations of lorentz invariance .",
    "more exciting , perhaps , is the fact that we can expect a significant amount of new data , from several different `` types '' of neutrino experiments , in the near future .",

    "<S> in particular , we compute how well a combined kamland and solar data analysis is able to constrain a specific form of violation of cpt invariance by placing a very stringent upper bound , @xmath0  ev@xmath1 at @xmath2 cl ( @xmath3 refers to neutrinos , @xmath4 to antineutrinos ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate upper bounds on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these are quite poor due to the fact that matter effects are almost irrelevant at kamland , which leads to an intrinsic inability to distinguish whether the antineutrino mixing angle is on the light ( @xmath6 ) or dark side of the parameter space ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss whether this ambiguity can be resolved by future long - baseline @xmath8 searches . </S>"
