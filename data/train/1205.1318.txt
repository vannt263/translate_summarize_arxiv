    "quantum mechanical scattering in one dimension describes many actual phenomena to a good approximation .",
    "the advantage of this theory is that it does not need special mathematical functions , while still retaining sufficient complexity to illustrate the pertinent physical concepts .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that there have been many articles dealing with various aspects of such scattering at various levels of detail , ranging from pedagogical issues  @xcite to edge - cutting research  @xcite .",
    "these papers emphasize notions such as partial - wave decomposition , lippmann - schwinger integral equations , transition operator , or parity - eigenstate representation , paralleling as much as possible their analogues in two and three dimensions .",
    "in other words , these approaches , like most of the standard textbooks on the subject  @xcite , employ the @xmath2 matrix [ note some significant exceptions , such as ,  e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ] .",
    "the elegance and power of the @xmath2-matrix formulation is beyond doubt .",
    "however , it is a `` black - box '' theory : the system under study is isolated and is tested through asymptotic states .",
    "this is well suited for experiments in elementary particle physics , but becomes inadequate as soon as one couples several systems .",
    "the most effective technique for studying such a coupling is the transfer matrix , in which the amplitudes of two fundamental solutions on either sides of a potential are connected by a matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the transfer matrix is a fruitful object widely used in the treatment of layered systems , like superlattices  @xcite or photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "optics , of course , is a field in which multilayers are important and the method is time honored  @xcite",
    ".    an extensive and up - to - date review of the applications of the transfer matrix to many problems can be found in the two excellent monographs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are addressed to anyone who wants to enter the field and provide a really professional level of penetration into the basic issues .",
    "a natural question thus arises : why yet another essay on the transfer matrix ?",
    "the answer is simple : a quick look at the literature immediately reveals the different backgrounds and habits in which the transfer matrix is used and the very little `` cross talk '' between them .",
    "in fact , many scientists are usually not aware of the mathematical basis behind the standard toolkits they are using in their everyday research .",
    "the main goal of this review is precisely to fill this gap .",
    "when one thinks in a unifying mathematical scenario , geometry immediately comes to mind .",
    "although special relativity is the archetypal example of the interplay between physics and geometry , one can not forget that geometrical ideas are essential in the development of modern physics  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "a number of geometrical concepts have been exploited to gain further insights into the behavior of scattering in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "the algebraic basis for these developments is the fact that the transfer matrix is an element of the group su(1 ,  1 ) , which is locally isomorphic to the @xmath0-dimensional lorentz group so(2 ,  1 ) .",
    "this leads to a natural and complete identification between reflection and transmission coefficients and the parameters of the corresponding lorentz transformation .",
    "as soon as one realizes that su(1 ,  1 ) is also the basic group of hyperbolic geometry  @xcite , it is tempting to look for an enriching geometrical interpretation .",
    "in fact , we propose to look at the the action of the transfer matrix as a bilinear ( or mbius ) transformation on the unit disk , obtained by stereographic projection of the unit hyperboloid associated with so(2 ,  1 ) .    borrowing elementary techniques of hyperbolic geometry",
    ", we can classify and reinterpret all the relevant features of these matrices in a very elegant and concise way , largely independent of the model considered .",
    "we stress that this formulation does not offer any inherent advantage in terms of efficiency in solving practical problems ; rather , we expect that it could supply a general and unifying setting to analyze the transfer matrix in many fields of physics , which , in our opinion , is more than a curiosity .",
    "we consider the quantum scattering of a particle of mass @xmath4 in one spatial dimension by a potential barrier @xmath5 .",
    "this is governed by the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath6 \\psi ( x ) = \\varepsilon \\ ,    \\psi ( x ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 @xmath8 being the energy of the particle .",
    "we assume this potential to be real ( i. e. , a hermitian operator ) but otherwise arbitrary in a finite interval @xmath9 . outside this interval",
    "it is taken to be a constant that we define to be the zero of energy .",
    "complex potentials can be used to model absorption , a situation which we shall not touch upon  @xcite .",
    "the treatment can be also adapted , with minor modifications , to deal with potentials for which @xmath10 , and also with the more subtle case of a position - dependent effective mass @xmath11 , which usually arise in superlattices  @xcite .    since @xmath12 ,",
    "the spectrum is continuous and we have two linearly independent solutions for a given value of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the general solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation can be expressed as a superposition of a right - mover @xmath13 and a left - mover @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 indicate that the waves propagate to the right and to the left , respectively ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the origins of the movers have been chosen to simplify the subsequent calculations .     and @xmath19 ) and output ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) amplitudes.,height=132 ]    to solve the problem in a closed form one must work out the schrdinger equation in @xmath9 to compute @xmath22 and invoke the appropriate boundary conditions , involving not only the continuity of @xmath23 itself , but also of its derivative . in this way , one has two linear relations among the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which can be solved for any amplitude pair in terms of the other two : the result can be expressed as a matrix equation , which translates the linearity of the problem . for our purposes , it is more advantageous to express a linear relation between the wave amplitudes on both sides of the scatterer , namely , @xmath26 @xmath27 being the transfer matrix for the potential .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients are the ratio of the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves to the amplitude of the incoming wave , respectively . denoting the amplitudes for waves propagating from the right as @xmath28 and @xmath29 and repeating the procedure , one easily finds that time - reversal invariance imposes @xmath30 while the conservation of the flux ( [ fluxcon ] ) gives @xmath31    in conclusion , the form of the transfer matrix is @xmath32 in the particular case of a symmetric potential [ i.e. , @xmath33 , it is clear that @xmath34 and therefore the matrix element @xmath35 is an imaginary number .",
    "thus far , we have related the amplitudes @xmath24 to the @xmath25 , as in equation ( [ m ] ) .",
    "this choice is by no means essential and we could relate the amplitudes taken in the reverse order . the corresponding transfer matrix , represented by @xmath36 , can be expressed as @xmath37 where we have used ( [ stokes ] ) .",
    "we will now bring up the paradigmatic example when the potential @xmath5 reduces to a rectangular potential barrier of width @xmath38 and height @xmath39 .",
    "the calculations can be easily carried out , so we skip the details  @xcite and simply quote the results for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( with the choice of movers in figure  [ figure1 ] ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "these coefficients correspond to @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 the expressions are @xmath46 where now @xmath47 .",
    "this can be obtained from the previous case with the formal substitution @xmath48 .",
    "finally , when @xmath49 a limiting procedure yields @xmath50 a detailed discussion of the significance of these three situations can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that one could also relate outgoing amplitudes in terms of the incoming amplitudes ( which are the magnitudes one can externally control ) .",
    "this is precisely the scattering matrix , which can be concisely written as @xmath51 and @xmath52 reads @xmath53 due to the properties ( [ stokes ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) , @xmath52 is unitary and with unit determinant , that is , an element of the group su(2 ) .",
    "note carefully that the transfer matrix depends on the choice of basis vectors  @xcite and special care must be paid when comparing results from different sources .",
    "for example , instead of specifying the amplitudes of the right and left - moving waves , we could also write a linear relation between the values of the wave function and its derivative at the points @xmath54 and @xmath55  @xcite . prefer to employ the adimensional variables @xmath56",
    "this looks very much as passing from position - momentum to creation - annihilation operators  @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath57 associated to these variables are related to @xmath24 by @xmath58 with @xmath59 and analogously at the point @xmath55 .",
    "the transfer matrix in this equivalent representation is @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for the hermitian conjugate and @xmath62 are real numbers .",
    "the role that the transformation @xmath63 will play in what follows justifies our choice in ( [ canvar ] ) .    since the determinant",
    "are preserved by matrix conjugation , we have that @xmath64 . in other words ,",
    "the matrices @xmath65 belong to the group sl(2 , @xmath66 ) of unimodular @xmath67 matrices with real elements .",
    "the transformation by @xmath63 establishes in fact a one - to - one map between the group sl(2 , @xmath66 ) of matrices @xmath65 and the group su(1 ,  1 ) of matrices @xmath27 , which allows for a direct translation of the properties from one to the other , as we will have occasion to check .",
    "irrespective of the representation used , transfer matrices are very convenient mathematical objects .",
    "suppose we know how the wave functions `` propagate '' from point @xmath55 to point @xmath54 , with a transfer matrix we symbolically write as @xmath27 , and also from @xmath68 to @xmath55 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the crucial point is that the propagation from @xmath68 to @xmath54 is described by the product @xmath70 this property is rather helpful : we can connect simple scatterers to create an intricate potential landscape and determine its transfer matrix by simple multiplication  @xcite .",
    "however , this important property does not seem to carry over into the scattering matrix in any simple way  @xcite , because the incoming amplitudes for the overall system can not be obtained in terms of the incoming amplitudes for every subsystem . while this is not a difficulty for a single scatterer ( the typical situation arising in particle physics and for which the @xmath2-approach was specially tailored ) , it constitutes a drawback in applications where a number of cascaded systems are present .      the complete determination of the transfer matrix for an arbitrary potential @xmath5 amounts to solving the schrdinger equation and , in consequence , it is not , in general , a simple exercise .",
    "very accurate approximation schemes are available , among which we cite the wkb  @xcite , the variational  @xcite , the monte - carlo  @xcite , or the finite - element methods  @xcite .    here , we favor a method inspired by the long experience in dealing with layered systems  @xcite . roughly speaking , the idea is that one can consider @xmath5 as made of successive constant barriers , as schematized in figure  [ figure2 ] @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71th barrier , of height @xmath72 and width @xmath73 , is situated between the points @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( we take @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) . in this way",
    ", we express @xmath27 as a product of matrices that characterize the effects of the individual discontinuities and propagations of the entire discretized structure , taken in the proper order , as follows  @xcite : @xmath78 when the number of barriers is large enough , the method should provide satisfactory results for any potential  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath79 accounts for the discontinuity at the interface between @xmath80 and @xmath72 , and has the form  @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the reflection and transmission coefficients at the interface @xmath84 and are given by @xmath85 the wave number is @xmath86 and , for simplicity , we have assumed @xmath87 .",
    "they verify @xmath88 and the outstanding composition law @xmath89     in elementary rectangular barriers.,height=151 ]    the matrix @xmath90 describes the effect of propagation through the barrier @xmath71 alone , and reads @xmath91 where the phase shift is @xmath92 .",
    "now , we have @xmath93    by taking the determinant in equation  ( [ matrizs2 ] ) and using ( [ determinante1 ] ) and ( [ detp ] ) we get a simple but relevant result : @xmath94 therefore , when @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the same ( as we have assumed until now ) , the determinant of @xmath27 is + 1 .",
    "when these potentials are different , this result also holds by renormalizing conveniently the amplitudes  @xcite .    if we denote @xmath97 which corresponds to the @xmath71th barrier sandwiched between two identical constant potentials ( that for simplicity we take as 0 ) , we can also rewrite equation  ( [ matrizs2 ] ) as @xmath98    sometimes , it is more convenient to work with unimodular matrices in sl(2 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the counterparts of interface and propagation can be obtained by conjugating ( [ eq : interface ] ) and ( [ eq : prop ] ) with @xmath63 ; the final result is @xmath99      to move ahead let us construct the matrices @xmath100 where @xmath101 or @xmath102 are the amplitudes that determine the behavior at the points @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "they are quite reminiscent of the coherence matrix in optics or the density matrix in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "observe that @xmath103 is hermitian and @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , one can readily verify that @xmath105 so they transform under @xmath106 by congruence .",
    "let now @xmath107 ( the greek indices run from 0 to 3 ) be the set of four hermitian matrices @xmath108 ( the identity ) and @xmath109 ( the standard pauli matrices ) .",
    "they constitute a natural basis of the vector space of @xmath110 complex matrices , so the coordinates @xmath111 with respect to that basis are @xmath112 so that @xmath113 the congruence ( [ congruence ] ) induces in this manner a transformation on the variables @xmath114 of the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 can be found to be @xmath117 and it turns out to be a lorentz transformation .",
    "this equation can be solved to obtain @xmath27 from @xmath118 .",
    "the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath119 generate the same @xmath118 , so this homomorphism is two - to - one  @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath111 are coordinates in a minkovskian space . since @xmath104 , the value of the interval ( in both points @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) is @xmath120",
    "so it is lightlike .",
    "moreover , the conservation of the probability current expressed in equation ( [ fluxcon ] ) means that the coordinate @xmath121 , defined in ( [ equivalencia ] ) , remains invariant and ( [ interval ] ) reduces to @xmath122 that is , a two - sheeted hyperboloid of radius @xmath121 , which without loss of generality will be taken henceforth as unity ( see figure  [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "all this shows that the group su(1,1 ) of transfer matrices is locally isomorphic to the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional lorentz group so(2,1 ) .",
    "in fact , in more technical terms , the matrices @xmath27 form a two - dimensional spinor representation of the restricted lorentz group so(2,1 ) : @xmath123 .",
    ".,height=226 ]    let us now rewrite the complex amplitudes @xmath124 in polar form @xmath125 denoting @xmath126 and introducing the angle @xmath127 in pseudospherical coordinates ( shown in figure  [ figure3 ] ) , we have @xmath128 this parametrization is very evocative of the standard one for the stokes parameters in the unit poincar sphere  @xcite , except for the fact that now the angle @xmath129 appears as the argument of hyperbolic functions .",
    "we refer to these parameters as hyperbolic stokes parameters .",
    "one can interpret the rotations @xmath130 and the hyperbolic rotations @xmath129 much in the same way as it is done for the poincar sphere  @xcite : a rotation of angle @xmath130 about the axis @xmath131 corresponds to a dephasing between left- and right - traveling waves without changing their relative amplitudes ; as it happens , for example , in the propagation inside a barrier . on the contrary , a hyperbolic rotation of angle @xmath129 corresponds to a change in amplitude between left- and right - traveling waves , as it occurs at the discontinuity between two barriers .",
    "to better appreciate the physical meaning of the lorentz transformation induced by a transfer matrix , we recall that a lorentz transformation @xmath118 can be always decomposed into a product of a spatial rotation @xmath132 and a boost @xmath133 along an arbitrary direction  @xcite @xmath134 the analogous factorization for a transfer matrix is the polar decomposition , which ensures that any matrix @xmath135 su(1,1 ) ( to simplify the notation , we drop the subscript @xmath136 in the rest of this section ) can be expressed in a unique way as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is positive definite hermitian ( `` modulus '' ) and @xmath139 is unitary ( `` argument '' ) . under",
    "the homomorphism discussed previously , @xmath138 generates a boost and @xmath139 a rotation , in agreement with equation  ( [ lr ] ) .    to find their explicit form",
    "we note that polar decomposition for the matrix @xmath3 in equation  ( [ tranm ] ) reads @xmath140 where we have expressed the reflection and transmission coefficients in the form @xmath141 using ( [ relation ] ) , the unitary component @xmath139 generates the rotation [ in @xmath0 dimensions ] @xmath142 that is , a spatial rotation in the plane 1 - 2 of angle twice the phase of the transmission coefficient .    the hermitian component @xmath138 generates the boost @xmath143 the modulus of the velocity @xmath144 ( we take @xmath145 everywhere ) and the relativistic factor @xmath146 of this boost are @xmath147 the matrix @xmath148 is then a boost to a reference frame moving with a constant velocity @xmath149 in the plane @xmath150 , in a direction forming a counterclockwise angle @xmath151 with the axis @xmath152 .    if , as it is usual , we introduce the rapidity @xmath153 from  @xcite @xmath154 we have the following appealing identification of the reflection and transmission coefficients with the parameters of the lorentz transformation : @xmath155 therefore , @xmath156 , behaves as a velocity , while @xmath157 behaves as @xmath158 .",
    "the convenient properties of the hyperbolic tangent have been exploited in dealing with layered systems  @xcite , and explain why the reflection coefficients are examined in greater detail than the transmission ones .",
    "one - dimensional continuous models provide a detailed account of the behavior of a variety of systems  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the actual particles , or states , or elementary excitations , as they may be variously called , is irrelevant for many purposes : there is always two input and two output channels related by a @xmath67 transfer matrix . in fact , this matrix can be viewed as a compact way of setting out the integration of the differential equations involved in the model with the pertinent boundary conditions ; this is what makes the method so effective .",
    "from this perspective , one can construct a general theory of the transfer matrix for second - order differential equations  @xcite .",
    "however , we prefer to explore some selected examples  @xcite ; this restricted choice reflects the authors personal bias , but it is illustrative enough to grasp what the method is about .",
    "transverse waves on weighted strings , longitudinal waves on loaded rods , acoustic waves in corrugated tubes , and water waves crossing sandbars , among other examples  @xcite , are governed by the classical wave equation @xmath159 here @xmath160 is the amplitude of the considered phenomena ( in the above - mentioned examples @xmath160 stands for the transverse displacement of the string , the displacement of a point whose equilibrium position is @xmath161 , the pressure above ambient , or the height of the surface above its equilibrium level , respectively ) , and @xmath162 is the local propagation speed of the perturbation .",
    "we continue to use complex notation , with the understanding that the physical wave is the real part . for a monochromatic perturbation of angular frequency @xmath163 [ @xmath164 equation ( [ eq : cwe ] )",

    "the mismatched impedances generate the reflected and transmitted waves  @xcite , while the application of the proper boundary conditions at the discontinuity points ( which depend on the particular model under consideration ) provide the corresponding amplitude coefficients .",
    "we next consider the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in a ( nonmagnetic ) stratified medium , whose optical properties are contained in the dielectric function @xmath167 [ @xmath168 is the local value of the refractive index ] . for a monochromatic component of frequency @xmath163",

    ".    apparently , equation ( [ eq : abel2 ] ) is identical to ( [ eq : helm ] ) , and the theory can be immediately extended here , expressing the solution as a superposition of a left- and right - mover fields . but",

    "let us apply these matrices to the illustrative example of an optical cavity consisting of two spherical mirrors of radii @xmath204 and @xmath205 , separated a distance @xmath201 , which will be examined in more detail in section 6.3 ( see figure  [ figure6 ] ) .",

    "moreover , a standard calculation shows that the expression ( [ eq : exwan ] ) for the wigner angle @xmath409 gives precisely the area of this triangle @xcite .",
    "we recall that for a hyperbolic ( spherical ) triangle the sum of the angles is less ( greater ) than @xmath425 with the angular defect ( excess ) being the area .",
    "this suggests to look at the wigner angle as a geometric phase . roughly speaking ,",
    "geometric phases are associated with the cyclic evolution of a system and the crucial concept to their understanding is anholonomy .",
    "anholonomy  @xcite is a phenomenon in which non - integrability causes some variables to fail to return to their original values when others , which drive them , are altered round a cycle ( the simplest example occurs in the parallel transport of vectors ) .",
    "this behaviour was anticipated by pancharatnam when discussing the phase shift that appears in the coherent addition of two polarized beams on the poincar sphere .",
    "it is worth mentioning that geometric phases associated with the group su(1,1 ) have been previously identified  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to view the rapidity triangle as imbedded in the unit hyperboloid , which is a manifold of constant negative curvature ( of value @xmath426 ) .",
    "the analogous triangle for rotations instead of boosts is traced on the unit sphere ( of curvature @xmath427 ) and the geometric phase appears as the area enclosed by the triangle on the sphere  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is tempting to infer that the wigner angle is just the area of the triangle on the hyperboloid , with the opposite sign to that of rotations : in fact , this is true as proved by @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "after our discussion in the previous section , it is clear that the problem should arise in the context of transfer matrices .",
    "first of all , it is worth emphasizing that the two combining boosts and the resulting one are in the same plane , usually assumed for simplicity to be the 1 - 2 plane .    in consequence , we restrict our attention to the composition of two hermitian matrices @xmath428 and @xmath429 for , as explained before , they are the equivalent to pure boosts . in complete analogy with equation  ( [ bcom ] )",
    "we have now @xmath430 where @xmath431 and @xmath432 are given by ( [ 12 ] ) and @xmath433 the appearance of an extra unitary matrix is the signature of a wigner rotation and , accordingly ,",
    "the wigner angle @xmath409 viewed in so(2,1 ) is just twice the phase of the transmission coefficient of the compound system . obviously , when @xmath434 , the wigner rotation is absent , since then we are dealing with two parallel boosts , whose composition leads to the famous einstein addition law of velocities @xcite .",
    "to show an explicit implementation of this phenomenon  @xcite , we take two potentials with hermitian transfer matrices @xmath435 and @xmath436 , and scattering coefficients @xmath437 and @xmath438 .",
    "equation ( [ htot ] ) fixes a third potential @xmath439 such that when put together the compound system is an antireflection system with phase in transmission equal to the wigner angle .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ figure16 ] , where the triangle is also plotted in the unit hyperboloid .          according to @xcite ,",
    "the turn associated with a rotation of axis @xmath408 and angle @xmath273 is a directed arc of length @xmath440 on the great circle orthogonal to @xmath408 on the unit sphere . by means of these objects ,",
    "the composition of rotations is described through a parallelogram - like law : if these turns are translated on the great circles until the head of the arc of the first rotation coincides with the tail of the arc of the second one , then the turn between the free tail and the head is associated with the resultant rotation @xcite .",
    "hamilton turns are thus analogous for spherical geometry to sliding vectors in euclidean geometry .",
    "it is unfortunate that this elegant idea of hamilton is not as widely known as it rightly deserves .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show how the use of turns affords an intuitive and visual image of all problems involved in quantum scattering and reveals the emergence of hyperbolic geometry in the composition law of transfer matrices .",
    "let us focus on the case of @xmath441 .",
    "this is not a serious restriction , since any matrix of su(1 ,  1 ) can be written ( in many ways ) as the product of two hyperbolic translations  @xcite .",
    "the axis of the hyperbolic translation is the geodesic line joining the two fixed points .",
    "as explained in section 4.4 , any pair of points @xmath366 and @xmath367 on the axis of the translation @xmath339 at a distance @xmath442 can be chosen as intersections of @xmath360 and @xmath361 ( orthogonal lines to @xmath339 ) with @xmath339 .",
    "it is natural to associate to the translation an oriented segment of length @xmath442 , with @xmath443 but otherwise free to slide on @xmath339 ( see figure  [ figure17 ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to hamilton s turns , and will be called a hyperbolic turn @xmath444 @xcite .     in terms of two reflections in two lines @xmath360 and",
    "@xmath361 orthogonal to the axis of the translation @xmath339 , which has two fixed points @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "the transformation of a typical off axis point @xmath280 is also shown.,height=188 ]    using this construction , an off - axis point such as @xmath220 will be mapped by these two reflections ( through an intermediate point @xmath363 ) to another point @xmath279 along a curve equidistant to the axis .",
    "these other curves , unlike the axis of translation , are not hyperbolic lines .",
    "what matters is that once the turn is known , the transformation of every point in the unit disk is automatically established .",
    "alternatively , we can formulate the concept of turn as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be a hyperbolic translation with @xmath445 positive [ equivalently , @xmath446 .",
    "then , @xmath3 is positive definite and one can ensure that its positive square root exists and reads as @xcite @xmath447 this matrix has the same fixed points as @xmath3 , but the translated distance is just half the induced by @xmath3 ; i.e. , we set @xmath448 this suggests that the matrix @xmath449 can be appropriately associated to the turn @xmath444 that represents the translation induced by @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we symbolically write @xmath450     and @xmath451 by using a parallelogramlike law when the axes @xmath452 and @xmath453 of the translations intersect.,height=170 ]    let @xmath415 and @xmath416 be the corresponding translated distances along intersecting axes @xmath452 and @xmath453 , respectively .",
    "take now the associated turns @xmath454 and @xmath455 and slide them along @xmath452 and @xmath453 until they are `` head to tail '' .",
    "afterwards , the turn determined by the free tail and head is the turn associated to the resultant , which can be interpreted as a translation of parameter @xmath456 along the line @xmath457 .",
    "this construction is illustrated in figure  [ figure18 ] , where the pertinent parameters are @xmath458 and @xmath459 .",
    "the application of ( [ 12 ] ) gives @xmath460 .",
    "the noncommutative character is evident , and can also be inferred from the obvious fact that @xmath461 .    in euclidean geometry , the resultant of this parallelogram law",
    "can be quantitatively determined by a direct application of the cosine theorem . for any hyperbolic triangle with sides of lengths",
    "@xmath415 and @xmath416 that make an angle @xmath411 , the expression is precisely given in equation  ( [ hcos ] ) .",
    "periodic potentials are those whose shape is repeated indefinitely with period @xmath201 ; i.e. , @xmath462 .",
    "the distinctive feature of these potentials is that the frequencies fall into continuous bands , separated by forbidden gaps . in the quantum context",
    "this was first noted by @xcite in the classic paper that laid the foundation for the modern theory of solids .",
    "this band structure also occurs , in principle , for mechanical , acoustical , and electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "there is a recurring interest in the related instance where the potential @xmath5 consists of a finite number ( say @xmath321 ) of identical cells .",
    "we shall call that situation a finite periodic structure ( the term locally periodic is also employed ) ; such potentials are produced by any finite lattice and they are of great importance for a number of applications , such as superlattices , photonic crystals , multilayers , etc , where the finite size must unavoidably be taken into account  @xcite .    from a theoretical standpoint finite periodic systems are more difficult to analyze because bloch theorem  @xcite , which so dramatically simplifies the periodic problem , does not apply .",
    "it is amazing that the finite periodic case can be solved analytically for arbitrary @xmath321 .",
    "this was first discovered by @xcite and rediscovered in the quantum context by @xcite and @xcite and later by several others  @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that the arbitrary potential @xmath5 ( the basic unit cell ) is replicated @xmath321 times at regular intervals , as schematized in figure  [ figure19 ] .",

    "the chebyshev polynomials play , for finite systems , a similar role to the one played by bloch functions in the description of infinite periodic systems .",
    "in addition , they are very useful to perform numerical calculations . however , it is not easy to separate the different behaviors according to the value of the trace , as it happens for infinite periodic media .",
    "for this reason , we will follow an alternative route based on geometrical properties .",

    "our thread has been to put geometry to work .",
    "this provides a useful and , at the same time , simple language in which numerous physical ideas may be clearly formulated and effectively treated .    in a first step ,",
    "we have transplanted the transfer matrix into space - time phenomena .",
    "this gateway works in both directions : here , it has allowed us to establish a relativistic presentation of the transfer matrix , but specific models can be also used as an instrument for visualizing special relativity .",
    "this is more than an academic curiosity : in fact , some intricate relativistic effects , such as , e.g. , the wigner angle , can be measured ( and not merely inferred ) by optical setups .    by resorting to elementary notions of hyperbolic geometry ,",
    "we have interpreted in a natural way the action of the transfer matrix as a mapping on the unit disk and on the upper half - plane .",
    "the trace turns out to classify and characterize the basic geometrical actions , which has physical relevance .",
    "in fact , in this arena , nontrivial phenomena can be understood in terms of analogues of vectors in euclidean geometry .",
    "we have applied this perspective to periodic systems , explaining the existence of bandgaps in appealing terms .",
    "in addition , we have presented schemes to generate quasiperiodic sequences based on tessellations of the unit disc .",
    "nothing of the material presented here is applicable _ per se _ , but everything can be relevant for researchers in other fields .",
    "this is the beauty of the approach . to our mind , the manuscript is better than ever .",
    "may each reader benefit and enjoy !",
    "our efforts towards understanding the problems posed in this paper were fueled in part , and were made much more interesting , by the interaction with a number of colleagues and friends .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive and self - contained discussion of the use of the transfer matrix to study propagation in one - dimensional lossless systems , including a variety of examples , such as superlattices , photonic crystals , and optical resonators . in all these cases , the transfer matrix has the same algebraic properties as the lorentz group in a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime , as well as the group of unimodular real matrices underlying the structure of the @xmath1 law , which explains many subtle details . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate on the geometrical interpretation of the transfer - matrix action as a mapping on the unit disk and apply a simple trace criterion to classify the systems into three types with very different geometrical and physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is applied to some practical examples and , in particular , an alternative framework to deal with periodic ( and quasiperiodic ) systems is proposed .    </S>",
