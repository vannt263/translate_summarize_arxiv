    "the wide band gap semiconductor zinc oxide ( zno ) is a material with much potential in future electronic devices .",
    "@xcite despite significant interest in its fundamental electronic properties ,  @xcite few spectroscopic studies of the full band structure exist .",
    "a small number of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies have been reported ,  @xcite yielding some agreement with density functional theory - based ( dft ) calculations and providing information on surface and defect states .",
    "however , arpes is limited to probing occupied states , and charging effects , surface preparation and sample quality are serious issues that can limit the accuracy of results .",
    "for example , photoemission measurements have variously located the fully occupied zn 3_d _ semi - core levels at energies ranging from 7.5 to 8.8  ev below the fermi level .",
    "@xcite the close proximity of the @xmath2 level to the o 2_p_-derived valence band has an appreciable impact on band structure calculations .",
    "@xcite as a result , there is a need for bulk sensitive measurements of the zno shallow core - level and valence band dispersion .    here , we present angular dependent resonant x - ray emission spectroscopy ( rxes ; also known as resonant inelastic x - ray scattering  rixs ) of the o k - edge of wurtzite zno crystals , for comparison with hybrid dft calculations and quasiparticle energies obtained within the _ gw _ framework .",
    "earlier studies used x - ray absorption and emission spectroscopy ( xas and xes ) to directly measure the o 2_p _ partial density of states ( pdos ) of nano - structured zno  @xcite and its anisotropy in the conduction band .",
    "@xcite we go further by exploiting the dipole- and * k*-selection rules of rxes to map the anisotropic valence band of single - crystal zno .",
    "rxes band mapping has been reported in simple materials like graphite , bn , sic , and more,@xcite and reports on more complicated compounds related to zno are appearing.@xcite however , to our knowledge there is no literature examining the k - edge electronic structure of a post transition metal oxide in the detail we present , or on any material using our image - based technique .",
    "further , we show crystal anisotropy to be a useful tool , allowing a larger part of the brillouin zone to be uniquely accessed via rxes .",
    "finally , compelling experimental evidence for use of the final - state rule in rxes is presented .",
    "the sample , a 500  nm zno epilayer , was grown on epi - ready ( 0001 ) sapphire substrates by plasma - assisted mbe , as described previously .",
    "@xcite as the sample was part of a separate study on doping , approximately 0.01%  ag was incorporated during growth , resulting in a layer averaged electron concentration of @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "the high crystalline quality of the film was confirmed by rbs under the channeling condition ,  @xcite a streaky rheed pattern , and by low temperature photoluminescence , which shows donor bound exciton peaks are dominant with up to three lo phonon replicas .",
    "the x - ray spectroscopy was performed on the undulator beamline x1b at the national synchrotron light source at brookhaven national laboratory , which is equipped with a spherical grating monochromator and a nordgren - type emission spectrometer .",
    "the energy resolution over the o k - edge was approximately 0.20  ev and 0.37  ev for the xas and rxes respectively .",
    "xas were recorded in total electron yield mode .",
    "the photon energy was calibrated using the o k - edge and ti l - edges of rutile tio@xmath5 measured during the experiment .",
    "the xes was calibrated with the 2nd order l - edge of zn from both a calibration metal sample and the zno sample .    due to its wurtzite structure , the zno _",
    "p_-projected pdos is strongly anisotropic .",
    "@xcite to measure the anisotropy xas and rxes were recorded for light incident at 20@xmath6 and 70@xmath6 relative to the sample normal , referred to as normal and grazing geometry , respectively .",
    "dipole selection rules mean that xas recorded in the normal ( grazing ) geometry is dominated by the contributions from o 2@xmath7 ( 2@xmath8 ) orbitals ( see inset , fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the opposite is true for rxes as the emission spectrometer is oriented perpendicular to the incident light : x - rays incident normal ( grazing ) to the sample result in grazing ( normal ) rxes .",
    "thus @xmath7 rxes is analysed with @xmath9 xas and vice versa .",
    "this correspondence has been observed for wurtzite gan by strocov _",
    "et al._.  @xcite    electronic structure calculations were performed within the hybrid dft ( hdft ) framework using the hse03 functional for exchange and correlation .",
    "@xcite quasiparticle effects were taken into account by a subsequent _ gw _ correction of the hse03 eigenvalues using many body perturbation theory . in the _ gw _ calculations ,",
    "the coulomb potential was fully screened using the random phase approximation dielectric function based on the hse03 eigenvalues and functions .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the _ ab initio _ combination of hdft and _ gw _ calculations gives excellent values for the fundamental gaps and @xmath0-band positions of many semiconductors .",
    "at present calculating a fully * k*-resolved _ gw _ band structure is too computationally intensive , so we compare xas and xes to pdos obtained from the _ gw _ calculation , and rxes to a modified hdft band structure .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the o k - edge xas ( open symbols ) and xes , taken well above threshold ( closed symbols ) .",
    "strong linear dichroism associated with the anisotropy in the unoccupied states is seen in the xas , especially in the first 10  ev above the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) where the @xmath7 ( black ) contribution is considerably stronger than the @xmath8 ( red ) contribution .",
    "the xes is comprised of o 2@xmath1 states near the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and a clear peak corresponding to o 2@xmath1 states hybridized with zn 3@xmath0 orbitals at 519.9  ev .",
    "these spectra are compared with pdos ( solid lines ) obtained from the _ gw _ calculation .",
    "the pdos have been convolved using gaussians with widths of 0.37  ev and 0.20  ev for the occupied and unoccupied states respectively .",
    "this is an estimate of the intrinsic instrumental resolution of the experiment ; no lifetime effects have been considered .",
    "the pdos have been aligned so that the main valence band peak matches with experiment .",
    "this yields excellent agreement with the entire xes , accurately locating the @xmath2 hybrid .",
    "the weak anisotropy in the pdos , combined with the lower resolution of the xes , explains the lack of contrast between @xmath7 and @xmath9 xes .",
    "the final state in xas includes a core hole that is not included in the calculation , and which prevents absolute comparison between the energy scales of the xas and xes .",
    "@xcite therefore , to compare to xas , the theoretical unoccupied pdos has been rigidly shifted by an additional @xmath10  ev , providing an estimate of the core hole binding energy . with this adjustment",
    "the experimental agreement is excellent in terms of both the main peak locations and intensities , and the orbital anisotropy .",
    "the success of the _ gw _ calculation is highlighted by a comparison with the hdft result .",
    "we calculate a band gap of 3.2  ev , compared to 2.1  ev obtained from the hdft calculation ( and 3.4  ev experimentally .",
    "@xcite ) the valence band pdos is also greatly improved : figure  [ fig2 ] shows the total o @xmath11-projected occupied pdos calculated using hdft ( black line ) , and with the _ gw _ correction applied ( red line ) . with _",
    "gw _ the zn 3@xmath0 ",
    "o 2@xmath1 hybrid peak is shifted to lower energy , peaking at @xmath12  ev , in much closer agreement with the experimental peak at @xmath13  ev ( closed symbols ) , correcting a key flaw of standard dft calculations .",
    "@xcite with the zn 3@xmath0 states located lower in energy the rest of the valence band is widened towards lower energies due to reduced @xmath1-@xmath0 repulsion .",
    "we note that scaling the hdft energy axis by a factor of 1.1 is enough to obtain relatively close agreement with the _ gw _ calculation ( dashed line ) for the occupied states .",
    "an additional upward shift of 0.5  ev to the conduction band is sufficient to achieve similar agreement for the unoccupied states .",
    "we have confirmed the accuracy of this approach approach by calculating the _ gw _ band structure at selected * k * points .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the band structure obtained from the hdft calculation , with the above corrections applied .",
    "the @xmath7 ( black ) and @xmath9 ( red ) orbital contributions to the eigenvalues are plotted independently ; error bars represent the relative weight of the contribution . to simplify rxes analysis , the @xmath7 ( @xmath9 )",
    "unoccupied states are plotted with @xmath9 ( @xmath7 ) occupied states ( see above ) .",
    "rxes can be viewed as a scattering process where the final state includes an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band , but no core - hole .",
    "so , unlike fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , no core hole correction is applied to the conduction band .    as expected , the band structure is that of a direct - gap semiconductor .",
    "the strongly dispersing band that forms the cbm at @xmath14 is also anisotropic : only @xmath7 states are found along @xmath14-m and @xmath14-k ; @xmath9 along @xmath14-a - h .",
    "this combination of strong dispersion and orbital selectivity make zno especially suitable for band mapping with rxes . for weakly correlated systems , and excitation energies close to the absorption edge ,",
    "resonant effects contribute to xes , adding a * k*-conserving coherent contribution to the scattering .",
    "the crystal anisotropy , combined with orbital selection rules , adds further * k*-selectivity to the rxes .",
    "for zno , the use of these properties in concert allows valence band dispersion to be measured across l - m-@xmath14-a - h - k-@xmath14 of the brillouin zone .",
    "rxes were taken over a range of excitation energies , indicated by vertical bars on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and horizontal bars on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the coherent fraction , extracted using standard techniques ,  @xcite ranged from 0.45 to 0.6 .",
    "( black ) and p@xmath15 ( red ) data .",
    "labels indicate excitation energy ( @xmath16).,width=302 ]     and ( b )  p@xmath15 orbitals .",
    "intensity scales from zero ( white ) to one ( black).,width=302 ]    using the above we construct figure  [ fig5 ] , which shows normalized intensity maps of the coherent fraction of each spectrum placed in * k*-space according to the position of the bars of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . figures  [ fig5](a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath7 and @xmath9 data , respectively .",
    "the imaging approach highlights the information contained in the raw spectra .",
    "dispersion toward higher energy at @xmath14 , as expected for a direct - gap material ,  @xcite is immediately obvious for both states . for the @xmath7 states dispersion along @xmath14-a - h - k",
    "is clearly resolved , with the upper band dispersing to lower energy .",
    "the bands around @xmath17  ev decrease in energy and increase in intensity along a - h - k , in line with theory .",
    "the position of the zn 3@xmath0 states is apparent , just below the theoretical bands .",
    "the spectrum obtained with an excitation energy of @xmath18  ev is located near both m and k , out of order with the other spectra , because of the strongly localised states in the conduction band at 10.5  ev .",
    "the @xmath9 states add m-@xmath14 and k-@xmath14 to the parts of the brillioun zone we can resolve . the lower energy band near @xmath17  ev disperses to @xmath19  ev approaching @xmath14 , in direct contrast to the observed behaviour of the @xmath7 band in this energy range , and in agreement with theory",
    ".    there has been much discussion about the correct use of intermediate and final states in rxes calculations .",
    "@xcite we note that if the core - hole correction were applied to the unoccupied states of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a downward shift of the theory by @xmath20  ev ) the @xmath7 spectrum taken with @xmath18  ev would be relocated to near @xmath14 and the strong intensity around @xmath21  ev would be anomalous .",
    "this is clear evidence for the use of the final - state rule in rxes .",
    "in conclusion we have used the strong anisotropy and dispersion of wurtzite zno , the * k*-selectivity of the rxes technique , and an hdft+__gw _ _ calculation to construct a band mapping of zno across a wide range of high symmetry points . the energy of the zn 3@xmath0 core level is located and evidence for the use of the final state rule in rxes is presented .",
    "it should be possible to use further high resolution rxes experiments to tune theoretical calculations across the technologically important post transition metal oxide and nitride series .",
