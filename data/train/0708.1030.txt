    "massive ob stars play an important role in astrophysics ; their winds and ejecta shape the morphology and ionization structure of their local environment , and provide a source of heavy elements which serve as the building blocks of planetary systems .",
    "b[e ] stars comprise a heterogeneous group of massive stars which all exhibit similar observational properties , yet range in evolutionary age from the pre- to post - main sequence @xcite .",
    "b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) represent one sub - class of the b[e ] phenomenon and are notable in that at least some share similar photometric , spectroscopic , and rotational velocity properties as luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) @xcite , which suggests b[e]sgs might be precursors to lbvs .",
    "b - type stars which exhibit strong h i balmer emission , forbidden and low excitation emission lines , commonly fe ii , [ fe ii ] , and [ o i ] , and evidence of warm ( t@xmath0 1000 k ) dust are assigned the classification of b[e ] @xcite .",
    "b[e]sgs are known to exhibit a hybrid spectrum characterized by broad uv resonance absorption lines and a wealth of narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that a non - spherical wind model consisting of a cool , equatorial component , and a hot , polar component best explained these observations .",
    "subsequent polarimetric observations seem to confirm the presence of an axisymmetric circumstellar environment in b[e]sgs @xcite , the base of which may sometimes be clumpy @xcite .",
    "while polarimetric observations indicate the presence of an asymmetric , clumpy wind in some lbvs and lbv - like objects @xcite , it is not yet clear whether they exhibit a clumpy , axi - symmetric geometry similar to that observed for b[e ] stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which might be expected if b[e]sgs are truly precursors of lbvs .    to date , four b[e ] stars have been identified in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , while eleven have been identified in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . owing to the known distance of the smc and lmc and the observed luminosities of the fifteen smc and lmc b[e ] sources , it is well accepted that all are b[e]sgs @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report the serendipitous discovery of the fifth known b[e ] star in the smc .",
    "the star was initially classified by @xcite as a compact h ii source ( [ ma93 ] 1116 ) likely characterized by broad h@xmath1 emission .",
    "a later optical photometric survey by @xcite classified the same target ( ngc346:kwbbe 200 ) as a classical be star residing in the smc cluster ngc 346 , which is known to be a rich source of current and recent star formation @xcite .",
    "our observations of the source were obtained in the context of assessing the formation and evolution of classical be stars in ngc 346 and other clusters in the smc and lmc @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopic observations were obtained on 15 november 2004 using the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4 m telescope hydra 138 fiber multi - object spectrograph .",
    "we used the 527 lines mm@xmath2 kpgl3 grating and a 200@xmath3 m slit plate , yielding a dispersion of 1.75   at 5500   ( r @xmath03000 ) .",
    "we obtained two 3600 second exposures with ngc 346:kwbbe 200 on a fiber ; for each exposure , we also assigned fourteen fibers to locations void of stellar sources to serve as probes of background sky emission .",
    "our ngc 346 exposures were bracketed by observations of a penray lamp exposure to wavelength calibrate our data .",
    "standard bias frames and dome flats were obtained at the beginning of each night of our run ; sky flats were also obtained to calibrate the fiber - to - fiber throughput of hydra .",
    "following bias subtraction using standard iraf techniques , we used pieter van dokkum s _ l.a.cosmic _ routine to identify and remove cosmic ray artifacts from our images . remaining standard reduction steps , including flat fielding , aperture extraction , and wavelength calibration were done within the _ hydra _ iraf package . to subtract the strong nebular lines present in our data",
    ", we evaluated the use of various combinations of our fourteen sky fibers in an iterative manner .",
    "following our best subtraction , we only see evidence of residual nebular contamination from [ o iii ] lines at 4959 and 5007  , at an intensity of 2% of the total sky emission in these transitions .",
    "we do not observe other narrow ( gfwhm @xmath02.9  ) emission profiles at other wavelengths , which would be indicative of a nebular origin ; hence , we estimate that any residual nebular components still present in our data should contribute @xmath42% to the equivalent widths quoted in this paper",
    ".    we also present archival _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath3 m observations of ngc 346:kwbbe 200 , obtained as part of program 63 ( houck pi ) .",
    "the data were reduced via the spitzer pipeline s14.0 software .",
    "photometry was extracted from post - pipeline mosaic images using standard iraf _",
    "aperture photometry techniques ; uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration are less than 5% @xcite .",
    "the continuum normalized optical spectrum of ngc 346:kwbbe 200 from 3935 - 5365   and 6000 - 6540   is presented in figures [ blue ] and [ red ] respectively .",
    "continuum signal to noise levels range from @xmath020 at 4200  to @xmath070 at 5200 and 6200  .",
    "ngc 346:kwbbe 200 is clearly characterized by a wealth of emission lines ; we used line identifications reported by @xcite and @xcite to identify the strongest lines detected at the resolution of our data , which are labeled in the figures and tabulated in table [ lines ] .",
    "the dominant species seen in emission is fe ii , although lines of [ fe ii ] , [ o i ] , mg i , and ti ii also are present .",
    "ngc 346:kwbbe 200 is also characterized by strong h i emission , from h@xmath5 ( figure [ blue ] ) through h@xmath1 ( figure [ ha ] ) , with all lines clearly exhibiting p - cygni profiles indicative of a strong outflowing wind .",
    "the h@xmath1 line is particularly strong and broad ; we measured our second exposure to have a net equivalent width of @xmath0 -267   and wings extending to -2100 km s@xmath2 and + 2190 km s@xmath2 .",
    "similarly , we measured h@xmath1 in our first exposure to have a net equivalent width of -266   and wings extending to -2100 km s@xmath2 and + 2100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in these measurements is not photon statistics , but rather given the presence of extended electron scattering wings and the curvature of the spectral response of the grating+detector near h@xmath1 , our choice of continuum placement .",
    "spectra of emission- and non - emission line stars located in other hydra fibers were used to calibrate the typical spectral response behavior near h@xmath1 , providing a constraint on the appropriate order of fitting function to use to fit the continuum region near h@xmath1 for ngc 346:kwbbe 200 .      to further explore the nature of ngc 346:kwbbe 200",
    ", we plot the star on a near - ir 2-color diagram ( black star ; figure [ 2cd ] ) , along with likely magellanic cloud classical be stars from @xcite ( red triangles ) and @xcite ( green triangles ) , a potential lmc herbig ae / be star ( blue cross ) from @xcite , and known smc and lmc b[e]sgs ( blue circles ) from @xcite , @xcite , and the 2mass catalog .",
    "ngc 346:kwbbe 200 s near - ir color is clearly consistent with that observed for other smc / lmc b - type stars characterized by dusty circumstellar envelopes , and is inconsistent with the typical color of classical be stars , which are characterized by gaseous circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "we next construct ngc 346:kwbbe 200 s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , using all available photometry .",
    "its observed ( b - v ) and ( v - i ) colors , 0.351 and 0.366 @xcite , are substantially redder than the expected intrinsic colors of main sequence ( -0.30 @xmath4 ( b - v)@xmath6 @xmath4 -0.07 , @xcite ; -0.44 @xmath4 ( v - i)@xmath6 @xmath4 -0.11 , @xcite ) or supergiant - type ( -0.23 @xmath4 ( b - v)@xmath6 @xmath4 0.0 , @xcite ; -0.37 @xmath4 ( v - i)@xmath6 @xmath4 0.0 , @xcite ) b stars . as such , we have assumed that ngc 346:kwbbe 200 is characterized by a _ minimum _",

    "the resultant sed incorporating u - band through spitzer irac 8 @xmath3 m photometry is shown in figure [ sed ] .",
    "an excess of ir emission is evident both at near - ir ( j - band ) wavelengths , likely originating from free - free and bound - free emission from hydrogen in a circumstellar envelope ( or disk ) , and at irac - band ir wavelengths , indicating the presence of warm dust in a circumstellar envelope ( or disk ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to crudely characterize this dust component",
    ", we have overlayed a planck function corresponding to a dust temperature of t = 800k in figure [ sed ] , which we believe best represents the observed sed trend .",
    "we have shown that ngc 346:kwbbe 200 s optical spectrum is dominated by emission lines from fe ii , [ o i ] , and [ fe ii ] .",
    "it exhibits broad p - cygni profile h i emission lines , indicative of a strong outflowing wind ; the strength of its h@xmath1 equivalent width , @xmath0 -267  is rivaled only by other known b[e]sgs @xcite and some lbvs @xcite .",
    "the star s circumstellar environment is clearly characterized by the presence of both gas and warm dust , as diagnosed from its near - ir colors ( figure [ 2cd ] ) and near- and ir - sed excess ( figure [ sed ] ) .",
    "these observational properties are characteristic of b[e ] stars @xcite , and inconsistent with the expected behavior of classical be stars ; thus , we suggest that ngc 346:kwbbe 200 should be re - classified as the fifth known b[e ] star in the smc .      to constrain the evolutionary status of ngc 346:kwbbe 200 , we compared its de - reddened photometry to standard kurucz model atmospheres @xcite using log ( z / z@xmath8 ) = -1.0 and log ( g ) = 3.5 .",
    "as shown in figure [ sed ] and summarized in table [ param ] , the sed data are best represented by a model having t@xmath9 = 19,000 k , and r@xmath10 = 14 r@xmath8 ( figure [ sed ] ) .",
    "given the significant uncertainty over the exact e(b - v ) reddening associated with ngc 346:kwbbe 200 , we caution that these stellar parameters should only be considered initial estimates ; the presence of a higher e(b - v ) reddening than assumed here ( 0.35 ) will inflate t@xmath9 and modify r@xmath10 . nonetheless , assuming a standard relationship that l@xmath10 = ( r@xmath10/r@xmath8)@xmath11 ( t@xmath9/t@xmath8)@xmath12 ) , we can estimate the luminosity of ngc 346:kwbbe 200 to be log ( l / l@xmath8 ) @xmath04.4 ( table [ param ] ) .",
    "these stellar parameters correspond to a crude spectral classification of b3[e ] ii .    using these crude stellar parameters , we plot ngc 346:kwbbe 200 on a hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram ( black circle ) , along with other known smc , lmc , and galactic b[e]sg ( green , red , and blue triangles ) and pre - main sequence herbig b[e ] ( hereafter haeb[e ] ) stars ( yellow squares ) in figure [ hrd ] .",
    "the canonical ( non - accreting ) evolutionary tracks @xcite and zero - age main sequence ( zams ) for 9 and 15 m@xmath8 stars at a metallicity appropriate for the smc / lmc , z = 0.001 ( black lines ) , and for 3 and 5 m@xmath8 stars at a metallicity appropriate for the galactic haebe stars , z = 0.020 ( red lines ) , are also plotted in figure [ hrd ] , along with the birthline for the z = 0.020 models ( solid light blue line ) and isochrones for the z = 0.001 models ( dashed green , blue , and yellow lines ) .",
    "it is clear that ngc 346:kwbbe 200 is well above the birthline of late - type b stars ( 5 m@xmath8 ) and is most similar to the lower luminosity magellanic cloud b[e]sgs stars reported by @xcite .",
    "if it were a pre - ms star , inspection of figure [ hrd ] indicates that ngc 346:kwbbe 200 would be positioned at a youthful position along the the z = 0.001 15 m@xmath8 evolutionary track , and intersect the log(t ) = 4.25 isochrone . such a young , high - mass object",
    "would likely still be deeply embedded in its natal star formation envelope , in contradiction to the star s observed optical v - band magnitude and our easy detection of its optical spectrum .",
    "@xcite provided a nice discussion of the classification of b[e ] stars and established numerous criteria for determining whether a b[e ] star is a b[e]sg , haeb[e ] , compact planetary nebula b[e ] , symbiotic b[e ] , or an `` unclassified '' b[e ] star , which we briefly review here . to be considered a b[e]sg , @xcite suggest stars should obey two primary criteria : a1 ) exhibit the b[e ] phenomenon ; and a2 ) be supergiants with log ( l / l@xmath8 ) @xmath13 4.0 ; and four secondary criteria , two of which are : b1 ) optical spectroscopic evidence of mass loss ; and b2 ) typically exhibit small photometric variations of order 0.1@xmath14 . to be considered a haeb[e ]",
    ", @xcite suggest stars should obey three primary criteria : a1 ) exhibit the b[e ] phenomenon ; a2 ) be associated with a star forming region ; and a3 ) exhibit evidence of accretion via inverse p cygni spectroscopic line profiles ; and three secondary criteria : b1 ) exhibit a luminosity of log ( l / l@xmath8 ) @xmath15 4.5 ; b2 ) exhibit large , irregular photometric variations ; and b3 ) exhibit evidence of warm and cool dust in their seds .",
    "note that some of the criteria for b[e]sg and haeb[e ] designations overlap ; moreover , a growing body of evidence suggests that some b[e]sgs may also exhibit significant , large amplitude photometric variability @xcite , indicating that this behavior is not exclusive to haeb[e ] stars .",
    "ngc 346:kwbbe 200 s strong p - cygni profile h i emission is indicative of mass - loss ; in our spectrum , we observe no evidence of inverse p - cygni profiles which would be indicative of infall .",
    "as shown in figure [ hrd ] , ngc 346:kwbbe 200 s crudely derived luminosity , log ( l / l@xmath8 ) @xmath04.4 , and location on a hr diagram is more consistent with the star being a low luminosity b[e]sg than a high luminosity haeb[e ] star .",
    "the star does reside in a young cluster , portions of which are actively forming low - mass stars @xcite , which seemingly agrees with the aforementioned `` a2 '' criteria of haeb[e ] stars ; however , other well known highly evolved massive stars reside in the region ( e.g. the wolf - rayet / lbv hd 5980 ; aka ngc 346:kwbbe 13 @xcite ) hence this particular criteria is probably not a useful discriminant in this situation . as such ,",
    "given the available data presently available for ngc 346:kwbbe 200 , we suggest the star is a b[e]sg , similar to the other 4 known smc and 11 lmc b[e ] identified to date @xcite .",
    "ngc 346:kwbbe 200 is a b - type star whose optical spectrum is dominated by fe ii , [ o i ] , [ fe ii ] , and strong p - cygni h i emission lines , and exhibits clear evidence of having a circumstellar envelope characterized by the presence of gas and warm ( t@xmath16 @xmath0800 k ) dust . based on these observational properties , we suggest that ngc 346:kwbbe 200 is a b[e]sg star , representing the fifth such object identified to date in the smc .",
    "our crude estimate of the star s luminosity , log ( l / l@xmath8 ) @xmath04.4 , its location on a hr diagram , and its observed line profile morphologies suggests it is most likely to be a b[e ] supergiant .",
    "we recommend several observational approaches be pursued to further constrain the evolutionary status of ngc 346:kwbbe 200 .",
    "mid- to far - ir photometric observations would allow one to search for the presence of cool dust , which is one of the defining characteristics of haeb[e ] stars @xcite and would not be an expected characteristic of b[e]sgs .",
    "moreover , high resolution optical and uv spectroscopic observations would facilitate the derivation of a more reliable estimate of ngc 346:kwbbe 200 s spectral type and luminosity , hence providing more conclusive evidence of the post - main sequence evolutionary status suggested in this paper .",
    "optical photometric monitoring , to search for and characterize variability , and measurements of the star s rotational velocity would aid efforts to explore evolutionary links between the b[e]sg and lbv phases of massive star evolution .",
