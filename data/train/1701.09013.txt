    "van der waals heterostructures are designed heterostructures made by stacking different two dimensional materials which are held together through weak van der waals interaction @xcite .",
    "such heterostructures not only broaden the range of materials that can be assembled and investigated , but also provide an important playground for discovering new properties different from the constituent materials and for realizing new quantum phenomena . in the past few years , graphene / h - bn has emerged as a model van der waals heterostructure .",
    "it is an ideal system for making high quality graphene devices , with reduced ripples and higher mobility @xcite .",
    "moreover , the moir@xmath0 superlattice induced by the lattice mismatch and crystal orientation can significantly modify the electronic properties of graphene , leading to various novel quantum phenomena including the self - similar hofstadter butterfly states @xcite and topological currents @xcite .",
    "there are also major changes in the electronic properties , e.g. emergence of second - generation dirac cones ( sdcs ) @xcite , renormalization of the fermi velocity @xcite , gap opening at the dirac point@xcite and gate - dependent pseudospin mixing @xcite .",
    "although graphene / h - bn heterostructure has been studied by various transport and stm measurements @xcite , direct angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements of the modulated electronic band structure have been missing .",
    "hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) shares similar honeycomb lattice structure with graphene , yet with a @xmath2 @xmath31.8@xmath4 larger lattice constant .",
    "the breaking of the inversion symmetry by distinct boron and nitrogen sublattices leads to a large band gap ( 5.97 ev ) in the @xmath5 band , which is in sharp contrast to the gapless dirac cones in graphene . by placing graphene atop h - bn , the different lattice constant and relative stacking angle @xmath6 between graphene and h - bn lead to moir@xmath0 pattern .",
    "the moir@xmath0 pattern periodicity is @xmath7 where a is the lattice constant of graphene .",
    "the relative rotation angle @xmath8 of the moir@xmath0 pattern with respect to the graphene lattice is given by @xmath9 figure 1(a , b ) shows the dependence of the moir@xmath0 periodicity and rotation angle on @xmath6 .",
    "the moir@xmath0 periodicity quickly decreases with increasing @xmath6 and the rotation angle of the moir@xmath0 pattern also strongly depends on @xmath6 .",
    "for example , when @xmath6 changes from 0@xmath10 to 4.3@xmath10 , the moir@xmath0 periodicity @xmath8 changes from 14 nm to 3.2 nm , and the relative angle changes from 0@xmath1 to 74.5@xmath10 .",
    "the superlattice brillouin zones ( sbzs ) are also rotated with respect to the brillouin zone of graphene due to the rotated moir@xmath0 pattern which is shown in fig.[figure : moire](d ) schematically .",
    "one expected result of the induced moir@xmath0 superlattice potential is the formation of first - generation dirac cones ( fdcs ) which occur at the same energy level as the original dirac cone ( odc ) yet translated by the reciprocal lattice vector of the moir@xmath0 pattern g = @xmath11 2@xmath5/@xmath12 . furthermore , due to the induced moir@xmath0 potential , second - generation dirac cones ( sdcs ) can emerge at energies different from the odc @xcite , and they are critical for the realization of self - similar hofstadter bufferfly states under applied magentic field .        graphene / h - bn heterostructures can be prepared by directly growing epitaxial graphene on h - bn substrate using plama - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pe - cvd ) @xcite or by transferring exfolicated graphene onto the h - bn substrates @xcite . while the stacking angle in pe - cvd grown samples is fixed to 0@xmath10 @xcite , the stacking angle in transferred graphene / h - bn samples can be carefully aligned and is widely tunable @xcite . with increasing stacking angle ,",
    "the interaction between graphene and h - bn is expected to become weaker and commensurate - incommensurate transition has been reported @xcite .",
    "the pe - cvd heterostructures with 0@xmath10 stacking angle and sample size up to a few hundred micrometers ( @xmath13 m ) have been recently studied by regular arpes , and sdcs have been reported @xcite . however , until now direct experimental results on the modulated band structure in graphene / h - bn with nonzero stacking angles have been missing .",
    "the challenge is related to the small sample size of a few micrometers ( @xmath13 m ) , which is much smaller than the typical arpes beam size of 50 - 100 @xmath13 m . by using nano - arpes with beam size of @xmath14100 nm , we are able to obtain the electronic structure of transferred graphene / h - bn heterostructures with nonzero stacking angles for the first time . here",
    "we report the electronic structure of such heterostructures with stacking angles of @xmath14 2.4@xmath10 and @xmath14 4.3@xmath10 respectively , and reveal the fdcs induced by the moir@xmath0 superlattice potential .",
    "transferred graphene / h - bn heterostructures were prepared using similar methods as reported @xcite . the entire process is shown in figure [ figure : sample24 ] .",
    "first , single layer graphene was exfoliated on polymethyl methacrylate(pmma , microchem , a6 , 950k)/polyvinyl alcohol(pva , sigma - aldrich ) stack ( fig .",
    "[ figure : sample24](a ) ) .",
    "single crystals of h - bn were grown using the method described before @xcite and h - bn flakes were exfoliated on a sio@xmath15/si wafer ( fig .",
    "2[figure : sample24](b ) ) . then the exfoliated graphene was transferred atop exfoliated h - bn flakes ( fig.[figure : sample24](c ) ) .",
    "pt electrode was deposited on one side of sio@xmath15/si substrate ( fig.[figure : sample24](d , e ) ) to avoid charging effect during arpes measurements .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) measurements were performed to confirm the existence of moir@xmath0 pattern .",
    "the extracted moir@xmath0 periodicity can also be used to determine the stacking angle between graphene and h - bn .",
    "figure [ figure : sample24](f ) shows the extracted phase profile for sample # 1 .",
    "the moir@xmath0 periodicity is estimated to be @xmath16 nm and the stacking angle is 2.4@xmath17 calculated from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the optical images for sample # 2 during the sample preparation are shown in fig.[figure : sample21](a - e ) .",
    "afm measurements were also performed to verify the existence of moir@xmath0 pattern afterwards .",
    "figure [ figure : sample21](f ) shows the extracted phase profile from afm image .",
    "the moir@xmath0 pattern periodicity and the stacking angle are extracted to be @xmath18 nm and 4.3@xmath19 respectively .",
    "nano - arpes measurements were performed at the antares beamline of the soleil synchrotron .",
    "antares beamline is equipped with two fresnel zone plates ( fzps ) to focus the beam size down to @xmath3 120 nm . there are two sets of motor systems to change the sample position , mechanical motors sz and",
    "st which have large motion range with @xmath3 5 @xmath13 m resolution and piezoelectric motors pix and piy which have smaller motion range and better spatial resolution @xmath3 5 nm . samples were mounted on a nanopositioning stage which was placed at the coincident focal point of the electron analyzer and the fzps .",
    "antares can operate in two modes , the imaging mode where the photoelectron spectra ( angle integrated or angle resolved ) are collected by changing the sample position to create two - dimensional images of electronic states of interest , and the spectroscopy mode where the detailed band dispersions are measured at fixed sample position .",
    "the data were recorded with scienta r4000 analyzer with photon energy of 100 ev using horizontal linear polarized light .",
    "the samples were annealed at @xmath3 250 @xmath10c until clean dispersions were obtained .",
    "the samples are kept at 80 k with vacuum better than @xmath20 torr during the arpes measurements .",
    "we first used the imaging mode to locate the small target graphene / h - bn flake on sio@xmath15/si substrate for sample # 1 ( red circle in fig.[figure : sample24](d ) ) .",
    "the angle - integrated intensity curves show two typical spectra as shown in fig.[figure : xps](b ) . the black curve with stronger intensity near e@xmath21 is attributed to the pt electron , and the blue curve with suppressed intensity near e@xmath21 and a peak at @xmath3 -13 ev",
    "is attributed to the bare sio@xmath15/si substrate @xcite . by integrating the spectral weight of the blue shadow area which is characteristic of sio@xmath15/si ( fig.[figure : xps](b ) ) , the spatial map ( fig.[figure : xps](c ) )",
    "shows similar shape with sio@xmath15/si in the optical image ( fig.[figure : xps](a ) ) .",
    "this confirms our assignment of the two types of spectra .",
    "the zoom - in intensity map around the graphene / h - bn region ( fig.[figure : xps](d ) ) allows to further distinguish different parts ( pt , graphene , h - bn and sio@xmath15/si ) clearly . moreover , by integrating the spectral weight near the fermi energy ( grey shadow area in fig.[figure : xps](b ) ) to have a better contrast between graphene / h - bn and bare h - bn , the graphene flake can be clearly identified ( fig.[figure : xps](e ) ) .        after locating target",
    "graphene / h - bn flake , we used the spectroscopy mode to probe the modulated band structure of transferred graphene / h - bn .",
    "figure [ figure : fs24 ] shows the intensity maps at energies from e@xmath21 to -700 mev . at e@xmath21 , six cloned fdcs are observed around the odc , consistent with our previous arpes studies on pe - cvd graphene / h - bn heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the corresponding sbz ( black dashed hexagon ) is rotated with respect to the brillouin zone of graphene ( blue solid line ) by @xmath3 6@xmath1 , which is consistent with the calculated rotation angle for the moir@xmath0 pattern @xmath8 @xmath3 66@xmath1 ( effectively 6@xmath1 in the map due to the six fold symmetry ) from the stacking angle @xmath6 @xmath3 2.4@xmath1 by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the size of the pockets becomes larger with decreasing energy , consistent with the conical dispersions expected .",
    "figure [ figure : cut24 ] further shows detailed cuts around the odc and fdcs to reveal the modulated band structures .",
    "the dispersions from the fdcs are obvious on both sides of odc in fig .",
    "[ figure : cut24](b , c ) .",
    "panels ( d - f ) show the dispersions along the cuts crossing the odc and fdcs simultaneously . from the momentum distribution curves(mdcs ) at the fermi energy ( fig .",
    "[ figure : cut24](g ) ) , we extract the momentum separation between the odc and fdcs to be @xmath22 @xmath23 which is consistent with the moir@xmath0 pattern periodicity inferred from afm measurements . using a fermi velocity of 7.37 ev@xmath24 ( 1.13@xmath25 m / s ) , the intersection point for 2.4 @xmath1 heterostructure",
    "is estimated to be at -493 mev . from arpes measurements ,",
    "the crossing point is measured to be at -490 mev ( pointed by black arrows in fig .  [",
    "figure : cut24](d - f ) ) , in agreement with the estimation , however in contrast with our previous studies on 0@xmath10 aligned graphene / h - bn @xcite , no obvious signatures of sdcs are observed from the constant energy maps and band dispersions .",
    "this is possibly due to the weaker interaction between graphene and h - bn when increasing the stacking angle between graphene and h - bn .",
    "we applied the same method to locate the target graphene / h - bn flake for sample # 2 .",
    "then spectroscopy mode was used to probe the detailed band structure .",
    "figure [ figure : fs21 ] shows the intensity maps at from e@xmath21 to - 700 mev .",
    "the signal from fdcs is weak at e@xmath21 and becomes more clear at -100 mev .",
    "this could be attributed to even weaker interaction between graphene and h - bn with an increasing stacking angle .",
    "the corresponding sbz ( black dashed hexagon ) is rotated by @xmath315@xmath1 with respect to the brillouin zone of graphene ( blue solid lines in fig.[figure : fs21](b ) ) , which is consistent with the calculated moir@xmath0 pattern rotation angle of 74.5@xmath1 from the stacking angle of 4.3@xmath1 .",
    "figure.[figure : cut21 ] shows the detailed modulated band dispersions around the odc and fdcs .",
    "the dispersions from the fdcs are weak but still detectable on both sides of the odc ( fig.[figure : cut21](b - d ) ) .",
    "panel ( e - g ) shows the dispersions along the cuts crossing the odc and fdcs simultaneously . the momentum separation between odc and fdcs",
    "is estimated to be 0.23@xmath260.04 @xmath23 from the mdcs at -100 mev ( fig.[figure : cut21](h ) ) , consistent with the moir@xmath0 pattern period extracted from afm measurements .",
    "the odc and fdcs intersect at around -840 mev , slightly deeper than the -770 mev calculated by moir@xmath0 pattern period .",
    "the difference is possibly attributed to the error bar from afm measurement .",
    "similar to the graphene / h - bn sample # 1 with stacking angle of the 2.4@xmath10 , no obvious signals of sdcs are observed from the constant energy maps or band dispersions .",
    "we report direct experimental results on the modulated band structure in transferred graphene / h - bn heterostructures with stacking angles of 2.4@xmath1 and 4.3@xmath1 respectively .",
    "we observed replicas of dirac cones translated by the reciprocal lattice vectors of the moir@xmath0 superlattice from the graphene k point . with variable stacking angle between graphene and h - bn ,",
    "the size and relative angle of sbz can be tuned .",
    "unlike previous studies on pe - cvd grown graphene / h - bn samples with 0@xmath1 stacking angle , no obvious signatures of sdcs are observed from the modulated band structure .",
    "this is possibly due to weaker interaction between graphene and h - bn at large stacking angle .",
    "it has been reported that at small stacking angle , there are regions of commensurate graphene stretched to fit the lattice of h - bn substrate , and there is a crossover from commensurate to incommensurate states between @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 @xmath3 1.5 @xmath1 @xcite . such commensurate to incommensurate transition",
    "may also explain the large variations of gaps measured on graphene samples with different stacking angles .",
    "another possibility is that pe - cvd graphene / h - bn samples may have stronger interaction between graphene and h - bn with 0@xmath1 stacking angle compared to transferred graphene / h - bn samples with tunable stacking angles .",
