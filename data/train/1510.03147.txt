    "dust matter moving along geodesic lines of space - time is the standard model in the study of cosmological and astrophysical problems in the framework of metric theories of gravitation , including modified theories of gravity .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation for test particles is as follows : @xmath0 here @xmath1  the action of a test particle , @xmath2  mass of a particle .",
    "the spaces that admit of a `` privileged '' coordinate systems , where ( [ eq0 ] ) admit a complete separation of variables are called stackel spaces ( ss ) , see [ ] , [ ] .",
    "the main results of stackel spaces theory can be found in [ ] , [ ] , [ ] .",
    "ss covariant condition is the presence of the so - called `` complete set '' of a commuting killing vector and tensor fields , which satisfy some additional algebraic relations .",
    "type of the ss metric tensor in privileged coordinate systems ( where separation of variables is accepted ) is determined up to a set of arbitrary functions where each function depends only on one variable .",
    "types of ss differ on the number accepted in a complete set of commuting killing vectors @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the presence ( absence ) among the separated variables of the `` wave '' ( null ) coordinates . in total , there are seven types of 4- dimensional ss with lorentz signature .",
    "the ss type is defined by a set of two numbers @xmath5 , where @xmath6  the number of commuting killing vectors accepted by the space ( the dimension of the abelian group of space - time motions ) , and @xmath7  the number of ( null ) variables in privileged coordinate systems ( for 4-dimensional spaces of lorentz signature @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "ss application in gravitation theories [  ] is based on the fact that exact integrable models can be developed for these spaces .",
    "the majority of well - known exact solutions is classified as ss ( schwarzschild solutions , kerr , friedman , nut , etc . ) .",
    "it is important to note that the other single - particle equations of motion - klein - gordon - fock and dirac , weyl admit separation of variables only in ss .",
