    "so far the top quark properties measured at the tevatron are in good agreement with the standard model ( sm ) predictions except the inclusive discrepancy of @xmath3 for @xmath4 gev because it is not confirmed by the d0 collaboration . ]",
    "forward - backward asymmetry @xmath0 @xcite , which , as reported by the cdf collaboration and the d0 collaboration , exceeds the sm prediction by about @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such an anomaly has been widely speculated as a harbinger of new physics and thus stimulated various explanations in extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "these extensions , albeit in quite different forms , usually have rich top quark phenomenology at colliders .",
    "since the tevatron is going to be shut down very soon , the task to screen out the right theory is left for the lhc @xcite .",
    "although the present top quark dataset at the lhc is moderate , it is already capable of scrutinizing the validity of some extensions .",
    "for example , the non - observation of a clear resonance in the @xmath6 production searched by the atlas and cms collaborations at @xmath7 tev implies that an axigluon with strong couplings to light quarks should be heavier than 3.2 tev @xcite , which makes it less attractive as an explanation of @xmath0 @xcite ( however , as pointed in the last reference in @xcite , a light axigluon with an enlarged width and reduced couplings to light quarks is still allowed by the current lhc measurements ) .",
    "meanwhile , since no excess of same - sign top quark events was observed by recent measurements from the lhc and tevatron @xcite , the light @xmath8 model based on flavor non - universal @xmath9 symmetry @xcite is also disfavored . among the surviving models two typical ones are the @xmath1 model @xcite and the diquark ( @xmath2 ) model @xcite , which , as pointed in @xcite , are preferred by the combined fit of @xmath10 and the total @xmath6 production rate measured at the tevatron . in this work",
    "we focus on these two models and perform a comparative study by considering several observables at the lhc .",
    "our study shows that each of these observables can be enhanced to the observable level and meanwhile exhibits different characteristics in these two models . as a result",
    ", the @xmath1 model is found to be tightly constrained by the charge asymmetry in @xmath6 production at the lhc , while the diquark model can be readily explored once more luminosity is accumulated at the lhc .",
    "we will consider the following observables :    * top quark charge asymmetry in @xmath6 production at the lhc , which is defined by @xcite @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the pseudo - rapidity of the top ( anti - top ) quark in the laboratory frame , and @xmath13 denotes cross section .",
    "this asymmetry reflects whether the top quarks on average are more boosted than the anti - top quarks or not .",
    "we note that the cms collaboration has recently measured this quantity with an integrated luminosity of 1.09 fb@xmath14 and obtained @xmath15 , which is consistent with its sm prediction @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a similar result is also reported by the atlas collaboration with larger uncertainties @xcite .",
    "so this asymmetry can be used to limit new physics models @xcite . *",
    "top quark polarization asymmetry in @xmath6 production at the lhc , defined by @xcite @xmath17 with the first ( second ) subscript of @xmath13 denoting the helicity of the top ( anti - top ) quark . unlike light quarks , top quark decays rapidly before forming any hadronic bound state .",
    "so its spin information is preserved by its decay products and can be recovered by their angular distributions . for the @xmath18 production at the lhc ,",
    "the top quark is not polarized at the leading order of the sm because the production proceeds mainly through the qcd interaction and the parity - violating electro - weak contribution to the polarization is negligibly small @xcite , but any addition of new parity - violating interaction of top quark may induce sizable polarization asymmetry @xcite .",
    "* enhancement factor of the @xmath6 production rate in high invariant mass region of @xmath6 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 incorporates the contributions from the sm and the new physics . in exotic @xmath21-channel or @xmath22-channel @xmath6 production ,",
    "the rutherford singularity can alter significantly the distribution of the @xmath6 invariant mass in high energy tail @xcite , so @xmath23 may deviate significantly from unity . *",
    "charge asymmetry in the associated production of a single top with a particle @xmath24 : @xmath25 this asymmetry can be measured by requiring that the top quark decay semi - leptonically and @xmath24 decay hadronically , and looking for the asymmetry between the event numbers with one lepton and one anti - lepton in the signal respectively .",
    "it was once suggested in searching for single top production in the sm and in limiting new physics models @xcite .",
    "depending on @xmath26 and the initial partons in @xmath27 production , @xmath28 may be far larger or smaller than unity .",
    "* charge asymmetry in @xmath29 production defined by @xmath30 like @xmath31 , this asymmetry reflects whether @xmath32 or @xmath33 is more boosted .",
    "given the interactions of the particle @xmath24 with quarks , this asymmetry is determined by @xmath26 and the energy of the lhc .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the features of the @xmath1 model and diquark model . then in sec .",
    "iii we discuss some observables in @xmath6 production , single top production and @xmath34 ( @xmath2 ) pair production . finally , we draw our conclusion in sec",
    "among various explanations of the @xmath0 anomaly , the model with a color singlet @xmath1 is a promising one @xcite .",
    "this model can be realized in an asymmetric left - right framework @xcite presented in appendix a , which is based on the gauge group @xmath35 and assumes that only the first and third generation right - handed quarks transform nontrivially under the group @xmath36 .",
    "the interaction relevant to our calculation is given as @xmath37 the @xmath6 production then gets additional contribution from the @xmath21-channel process @xmath38 via exchanging a @xmath1 , which may sizably alter @xmath0 at the tevatron .",
    "note that in the framework presented in appendix a , besides @xmath1 , the newly predicted neutral and charged higgs bosons can also contribute to the @xmath6 production . since the size of such contribution is model - dependent and",
    "may be negligible if these fields are heavy and/or the vev of @xmath39 is much higher than the electro - weak breaking scale @xcite , we in our study do not consider these contributions .",
    "another model we are considering is the color - triplet diquark model @xcite , where a new scalar @xmath2 ( called diquark ) is assigned with the quantum number ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) under the sm gauge group @xmath43 .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is then given by @xmath44 where the coupling coefficients satisfy @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the flavor index , @xmath47 is the antisymmetric tensor in color space , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the charge conjugate matrix . in this framework",
    ", the discrepancy of @xmath0 can be alleviated by the contribution of the @xmath22-channel process @xmath50 mediated by the triplet @xmath2 . in @xcite ,",
    "a comparative study of @xmath0 was performed in diquark models where @xmath2 is assigned in different representations of the @xmath51 group , and it was found that the triplet model is better suited to explain the @xmath0 anomaly without conflicting with other experimental results . in our analysis , in order to escape constraints from low energy processes such as @xmath52@xmath53 mixing , we set @xmath54 to be zero except @xmath55 .",
    "the common feature of the two models comes from the calculation of the @xmath6 production rate , where the interference of the new contribution with the sm qcd amplitude always partially cancels the pure new contribution .",
    "in fact , this cancellation is essential for the models to explain the @xmath0 anomaly and at same time keeps other observables consistent with their measured values at the tevatron .",
    "we checked that such cancellation persists in calculating @xmath56 discussed below , and the extent of the cancellation depends on the new particle mass and the collider energy .",
    "we also checked that , partially due to the difference in parton distributions for the initial states , @xmath57 in the diquark model usually exceeds that in the @xmath1 model if @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results for the observables at the lhc with @xmath7 tev . we take the sm parameters as @xcite @xmath60 and use the parton distribution function cteq6l1 @xcite by setting @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 denoting the renormalization scale and the factorization scale respectively .    for the constraints from the @xmath6 production rates , we consider the tevatron measurements @xcite , which are so far the most precise results .",
    "we require the predictions of the inclusive @xmath0 and the total @xmath6 production rate in each model to lie within @xmath64 region of their experimental values . as mentioned earlier",
    ", we do not consider the discrepancy of the @xmath0 in large @xmath6 invariant mass region reported by the cdf collaboration ( about @xmath65 away from its sm prediction for @xmath66 gev@xcite ) since it is not confirmed by the d0 collaboration @xcite .",
    "we also do not consider the constraint from the measured @xmath6 invariant mass distribution at the tevatron because the shape of such a distribution in high energy tail is sensitive to the cut efficiency of event selection and also to qcd corrections @xcite .      before presenting our results for @xmath67",
    ", we point out two features of @xmath0 . first , because the valence quark in proton always moves in parallel with the proton , @xmath68 observed at the tevatron means that the top quark tends to move along with the valence quark than to move in the opposite direction .",
    "second , @xmath0 depends on the collider energy @xmath69 .",
    "we found that as @xmath69 increases , @xmath10 increases monotonically in the @xmath1 model but decreases monotonically in the diquark model .",
    "this means that if the two models predict a same @xmath0 at the tevatron , then as @xmath69 increases to the lhc energy , the tendency of top quark to move with the valence quark ( @xmath22 or @xmath70 ) in the @xmath1 model should be larger than that in the diquark model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the correlation between @xmath71 at the tevatron and @xmath31 at the lhc in these two models .",
    "such results are obtained by scanning over the two - dimension parameter space of the models and keeping only the samples surviving the tevatron constraints .",
    "we see that @xmath71 and @xmath31 are of the same sign and with the increase of @xmath57 the value of @xmath31 increases too .",
    "this behavior can be understood by noting the following three points .",
    "the first is that in the @xmath6 rest frame the top and the anti - top outgo back to back .",
    "so , regardless the underlying dynamics , we always have latexmath:[$|\\eta_t| =    process @xmath38 or the @xmath22-channel process @xmath73 at @xmath74 colliders like the lhc , the @xmath6 rest frame tends to be boosted along the direction of @xmath70 or @xmath22 quark since they are the valence quarks in proton . for a given event ,",
    "the direction of the valence quarks is definite .",
    "then , if the scattering angle @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) between the outgoing top quark and the valence quark in @xmath6 rest frame is less ( larger ) than @xmath77 , @xmath78 defined in the laboratory frame tends to be larger ( less ) than @xmath79 .",
    "and the last point is if the top quark has equal probability to move along and to move in opposite to the valence quark direction at the lhc ( corresponding to @xmath80 in @xmath81 collision ) , the number of events with @xmath82 should be same as that with latexmath:[$|\\eta_t| <    former probability exceeds the latter probability ( corresponding a positive @xmath0 in @xmath81 collision ) , more events with @xmath82 than with @xmath84 should be obtained and thus @xmath67 is positive .",
    "this analysis shows that @xmath85 at the tevatron can be treated as an indicator of @xmath67 at the lhc .",
    "[ fig1 ] also indicates that @xmath67 in the @xmath1 model is usually several times larger than that in the diquark model for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "one underlying reason is , as we mentioned before , the probability of the top quark to move along with the valence quark in the @xmath1 model exceeds that in the diquark model .",
    "another reason is from the parton distribution of the initial states : at the tevatron we have @xmath86 , while at the lhc @xmath87 .",
    "so when both models predict a same @xmath0 at the tevatron , the parton distribution in the @xmath1 model is relatively enhanced at the lhc .",
    "another striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that a large portion of the samples in the @xmath1 model have been ruled out by the measured value of @xmath67 at @xmath88 level , which implies that the @xmath1 model has already been tightly limited by the charge asymmetry .",
    "in contrast , in the diquark model the @xmath67 value always lie within @xmath88 range of its experimental central value .",
    "we checked that the @xmath67 value in the diquark model will be further reduced at the lhc as @xmath69 is raised to 14 tev .    in getting fig.1",
    ", we note that , since the new physics contributions to the @xmath6 cross section are relatively small , both @xmath56 and @xmath3 can be approximated as the sm value plus the new physics effect : @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ", we use their nlo qcd results : @xmath93 @xcite and @xmath94 ( which is obtained by the mcfm package @xcite ) . in calculating @xmath95 and @xmath96 ,",
    "we encounter two kinds of cross sections : the sm cross sections @xmath97 and the new physics corrections @xmath98 .",
    "we use the tree - level expression of @xmath99 due to the absence of its high order qcd correction in literatures , while for the @xmath97 , we use its most precise nnlo result , which is obtained by multiplying its lo prediction by a k factor , i.e. @xmath100 for the lhc @xcite and @xmath101 for the tevatron @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the dependence of @xmath31 on the model parameters such as the coupling strength and the new particle mass . due to the difference in kinematic features of the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 channels , the mass ranges favored by @xmath3 and @xmath102 are @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the two models respectively .",
    "this figure indicates that for a given new particle mass the coupling coefficient ( @xmath55 or @xmath105 ) is restricted in a certain region , and as the new particle becomes heavy , the region moves upward .",
    "this is because we have required the samples shown in the figure to explain the @xmath0 anomaly and at same time to satisfy the @xmath106 constraint .",
    "this figure also indicates that a heavy new particle along with a strong coupling can predict a large @xmath31 .",
    "we checked this case and found it usually corresponds to a large @xmath0 at the tevatron .     with @xmath23 and @xmath107 at the lhc respectively .",
    "[ fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=307 ] with @xmath23 and @xmath107 at the lhc respectively .",
    "[ fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=307 ]    in the left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the correlation of the @xmath31 with the ratio @xmath23 defined by eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) . as we mentioned before , for the @xmath21-channel or the @xmath22-channel @xmath6 production , the rutherford singularity tends to push more events to high @xmath108 region so that @xmath23 may be significantly larger than unity .",
    "this is reflected in the @xmath1 model where @xmath23 is in the range of 2.0 and 7.7 and in the diquark model where @xmath23 varies from 1.2 to 2.7 .",
    "since the predicted @xmath23 is in two separated regions , @xmath23 may be utilized to discriminate the models .",
    "we checked the reason for the difference and found that the cancellation between the pure new physics contribution and the interference contribution in the @xmath1 model is not as strong as that in the diquark model .",
    "we also note that the lhc with higher luminosity is capable of exploring the models with @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "so we conclude that the quantity @xmath23 is complementary to @xmath67 in testing the models .",
    "since the new interactions violate parity and hence can lead to top quark polarization asymmetry @xmath107 at the lhc , in the right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the correlation of @xmath31 with @xmath107 .",
    "this figure indicates that the value of @xmath107 increases with the increase of @xmath31 with its maximum value reaching @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the two models respectively . to roughly estimate the observability of such asymmetry",
    ", we calculate the statistical significance @xmath112 defined in @xcite for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath14 without considering the cut efficiency and the systematic uncertainties .",
    "we find that for nearly all the samples in the models , the predicted @xmath107 can reach its @xmath113 sensitivity , which is @xmath114 for the @xmath34 model and @xmath115 for the diquark model .      in the @xmath1 ( diquark ) model",
    ", the associated production of single top quark with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) proceeds by the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "the total production rates ( top events plus anti - top events ) can reach 60 pb and 160 pb for the surviving samples in the two models respectively .    due to the electric charge carried by @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "the production rates of the top quark and anti - top quark are not equal . since the initial state is @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) for the top production and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) for the anti - top production , the parton distributions determine @xmath122 for the @xmath1 model and @xmath123 for the diquark model , where @xmath28 denotes the charge asymmetry of the associated production defined in eq .",

    "we checked our results for the @xmath152 production and found that the gluon annihilation contribution is usually negligibly small .",

    "for example , the first and third generation right - handed quarks may have higgs terms like @xmath186 where flavor indices @xmath187 and @xmath188 are @xmath189 and @xmath190 , @xmath39 and @xmath191 are doublet fields under the group @xmath36 and @xmath192 respectively with @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and @xmath195 denotes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of @xmath39 ; whereas the second generation right - handed quarks take on the more conventional form @xmath196 obviously , once the field @xmath39 gets its vev the sm mechanism for mass generation is recovered with the quark yukawa coupling coefficients @xmath197 given by @xmath198 for @xmath199 and @xmath200 for @xmath201 .",
    "in addition , as suggested by @xcite , the five dimension operators in eq.([operator ] ) may be generated by integrating out heavy @xmath202-singlet fermions with mass scale @xmath203 , which usually carry appropriate hypercharge .    in the @xmath1 model ,",
    "the additional contribution to the @xmath6 production comes from the @xmath21-channel process @xmath204 via the exchange of @xmath1 or neutral / charged component fields of the @xmath39 .",
    "obviously , if the component fields are heavy and/or if @xmath195 is much larger than the electro - weak breaking scale so that the @xmath205 interactions are suppressed ( see eq.[operator ] ) , the latter contribution can be safely neglected , which was done in literature @xcite .",
