    "powerful radio galaxies are visible to high redshift and hence can be used as pointers to large - scale structures .",
    "it has been hypothesised that powerful radio galaxies may represent a means of discovering high - redshift clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , le fvre et al . 1996 ; fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) through their x - ray emission , with the possibility of placing constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "analysis of pointed rosat observations of @xmath6 radio galaxies and quasars in the 3crr catalogue ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) gave support to this hypothesis , resulting in claims of the detection of hot ( @xmath0 5 kev ) , luminous ( @xmath7 ergs s@xmath2 ) gas around a number of sources ( crawford et al .",
    "1993 , worrall et al . 1994 ; crawford & fabian 1995 , 1996 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "1998a ; hardcastle & worrall 1999 ; crawford et al .",
    "however , because of the limited sensitivity and spectral resolution of the instruments on - board rosat , there was no spectral confirmation of these results , and the detected emission was spatially resolved in relatively few cases ( see hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) . with the advent of sensitive x - ray telescopes , it is now possible to detect and study the environment of such galaxies as a function of cosmic time .",
    "several physical mechanisms are responsible for the x - ray emission from radio galaxies .",
    "thermal emission from a hot atmosphere surrounding a radio galaxy gives information about the large scale gas distribution and the interaction between the expanding radio source and the external medium .",
    "unresolved emission from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) may consist of thermal or non - thermal components , and probes the physical conditions near the central engine .",
    "the radio jets , lobes and hot spots can also emit detectable x - rays , by the inverse compton ( ic ) and/or synchrotron processes .",
    "ic x - ray measurements can be combined with radio data to give information about particle acceleration and magnetic field strength .",
    "powerful radio galaxies at intermediate redshift are found in rich , cluster - like environments ( hill & lilly 1991 ) and some ( but not all ) low - redshift high - power objects such as cygnus a ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2002 ; markevitch , sarazin & vikhlinin 1999 ) and hydra a ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; nulsen et al .",
    "2002 ) also lie in rich clusters which have been studied in detail .",
    "the x - ray / radio properties of frii galaxies of low / intermediate redshift have been studied with rosat ( e.g. , carilli , perley & harris 1994 ; leahy & gizani 1999 ; hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) .",
    "hardcastle & worrall ( 2000 ) estimated the gas pressure in the x - ray external medium and compared it to the internal pressure of the radio - emitting plasma assuming the condition of minimum total energy in the magnetic field and radiating electrons .",
    "they concluded that the majority of the sources might be underpressured with respect to the external medium , and discussed additional contributions to the internal pressure that would avoid collapse of the radio lobes .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     *",

    "data *    if we consider the scattering of photons from the cmb alone , then the predicted cmb / ic flux density for 3c184 is a factor @xmath0 20 below the observed flux density in the lobes as measured by the  data alone .",
    "we also computed the expected flux from a model whose additional source of scattered photons were infrared photons from an hidden quasar .",
    "this model consists of a central point source with a flat spectrum giving flux density of 0.1 jy between 3@xmath11 and 4@xmath12 hz , which is similar to that found by meisenheimer et al .",
    "@xcite for objects at the same redshift as 3c184 .",
    "the model follows the prescription of brunetti ( 2000 ) and is described in hardcastle et al .",
    "@xcite . at equipartition",
    ", we calculate a combined flux density at 1 kev from the three photon fields of 0.22 njy ( see table [ tab : synres ] ) , still insufficient to explain the x - ray flux if the  measured flux is taken . in this model ,",
    "the internal pressure of the radio lobes would be 9.1@xmath13 pa , which is a factor of 20 higher than the upper limit deduced for the x - ray external medium .",
    "the measured x - ray flux of the soft component at this energy is 1.9 njy if we adopt the two power - law model ( model 3 ) described in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra1 ] .",
    "the magnetic field would need to be reduced by a factor of 3 to produce the measured flux density at 1 kev by ic .",
    "however , we use the _ chandra _ observation to disentangle the emission from the radio lobe and the core .",
    "we are unable to fit a spectrum from the lobe region alone , but with the count rate from the region corresponding to the north - western radio lobe we estimated a flux at 1 kev of 0.2@xmath14 njy , a factor of 10 lower than what was found from the  spectrum and in excellent agreement with the prediction from ssc / ic and ir photon scattering derived from the radio data .",
    "this supports further the thermal nature of most of the soft x - ray emission from the 3c184 spectrum , as observed by .",
    "the x - ray flux of the 3c 292 lobes at 1 kev is less than a factor of two above the cmb / ic model predictions , supporting the equipartition assumption found for the lobes and hotspots of several other radio galaxies ( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 , brunetti et al .",
    "1997 ) . with an equipartition field",
    "the pressure in the lobes due to electrons and magnetic field is 7.9@xmath15 pa , which is in reasonable agreement with an average external pressure in the x - ray gas over the volume of the lobes ( @xmath16 pa ) .",
    "a reduction in the lobe magnetic field by a factor of 2 would bring the internal and external pressure in balance .    in the case of 3c322 ,",
    "the prediction of the lobe ic x - ray emission from radio data is in excellent agreement with the measured x - ray flux at 1 kev , assuming a single power - law model of photon index @xmath17 = 1.6 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra3 ] ) despite our reservations about the spectral fitting .",
    "although there is strong radio hotspot emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c322images ] , insert ) its synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) x - ray emission is negligible compared with the x - ray flux produced by the ic scattering of the cmb photons .",
    "the combined spectro - imaging analysis of 3c184 indicates that half the x - ray emission is produced by an absorbed component which is associated with the agn nucleus .",
    "we see also non - thermal emission from a soft component which is likely to be radio related , at least in part .",
    "other powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 ; donahue et al .",
    "2003 ) show soft x - ray emission associated with the position of the outer radio lobes . by comparing the  observation with the 20 ks chandra observation ,",
    "the emission from the lobes is separated from the nuclear emission .",
    "only 5 _ chandra _ counts correspond to the region of the radio lobes , not sufficient for a spectral analysis .",
    "however , we estimated an x - ray flux density of 0.2@xmath14 njy at 1 kev , which is in excellent agreement with the flux predicted by a model where the source of scattered photons is a combination of cmb and ir photons from the nucleus .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the radio - galaxy lobe is very close to equipartition between the magnetic field and relativistic electrons .",
    "we have marginal evidence , from the spatial analysis , for a third component corresponding to a gaseous environment .",
    "the luminosity of the extended component estimated from the @xmath18-model fitting ( with @xmath18 fixed at 0.66 ) is 5.9@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 within the detection radius of 88 arcsec , which rises to @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 when we extrapolate out to the virial radius . for this luminosity to be in agreement with the luminosity - temperature relation of vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) the cluster should be at a temperature of @xmath20 kev .",
    "the _ chandra _ data fix the contribution of the core and lobe emission to the global spectrum extracted from the  data .",
    "we found that most of the  emission at low energy is thermal in nature and associated with emission from large spatial scales ( at least 40 arcsec - 320 kpc ) .",
    "we interpret this result as the detection of a cluster - like environment around the radio galaxy .",
    "the best - fitting temperature is @xmath21 kev with a lower 1@xmath22 limit of 1.7 kev . from the spectral best - fitting temperature ,",
    "the measured bolometric x - ray luminosity ( @xmath23 erg s@xmath2 , in reasonable agreement with the spatially - derived luminosity ) places the object a factor of 5 below the @xmath24 relation for cluster at @xmath25 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2002 ) . is this medium rich enough to confine the expansion of the radio galaxy ?",
    "the average external pressure of the x - ray gas over the volume of the radio lobes is 3.0@xmath26 pa , a factor of 30 lower than the minimum internal pressure of the lobes ( 9.1@xmath13 pa ) .",
    "this is not surprising given the small physical size of the radio galaxy .",
    "independent evidence in support of a cluster comes from the gravitational arc detected with the hst ( deltorn et al .",
    "1997 ) at 4.9 arcsec to the northeast of the radio galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3c184hst ] ) .",
    "these authors detect an over - density of galaxies around the radio galaxy 3c184 and measure 11 galaxies at a redshift of @xmath271 . from the measured redshift they derived a velocity dispersion of @xmath28 km s@xmath2 . as a first approximation",
    ", we can estimate the expected temperature of the gas from the galaxy velocity ( i.e. sarazin ( 1986 ) : @xmath29 km s@xmath30 , which gives @xmath31 , in good agreement with our spectral results .",
    "the comparison with the independent analysis of deltorn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) confirm that the temperature should be around 3 kev , despite the large uncertainties due to the limited statistics in our spectral analysis .",
    "deltorn et al .",
    "computed a mass enclosed within 40 @xmath32 kpc ( 5 arcsec ) of @xmath33 @xmath34 and derived a virial mass of 7.7 @xmath35 @xmath32 @xmath34 , from the central velocity dispersion calculated for an isothermal sphere .    if we adopt the proton density calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : radprof1 ] , we estimate a gas - mass within a cylinder of radius 5 arcsec integrated along the line of sight of @xmath36 @xmath34 . we compared this value with the total mass calculated in the same cylinder ( and scaled for our cosmology ) of deltorn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , e.g. @xmath37 m@xmath38 , and found a gas - mass to total - mass ratio of order 0.01 .",
    "this is at least a factor of 10 lower than that observed for clusters of galaxies at lower redshift .",
    "errors on this estimate are large , and the largest uncertainty is likely to come from the @xmath18-model parameters .",
    "the best estimate for the core - radius , seems to suggest a rather shallow potential well with respect to other clusters at the same redshift ( e.g. vikhlinin et al .",
    "2002 ) , more similar to galaxy groups , rather than rich clusters . on the other hand , the optical analysis of deltron et al . supports the existence of a large total mass around 3c184 , and the temperature we measure also points in this direction .",
    "since the spectral fit also implies an underlumious object , we can speculate that the cluster around 3c184 is somehow peculiar in its relatively high temperature but low luminosity ( and low gas fraction ) if compared to lower redshift galaxy clusters .",
    "however , we note that croston et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a trend for galaxy groups harbouring a radio - loud source to be hotter than radio - quiet galaxy groups .",
    "3c184 might show the effect of gas heating by a radio source at @xmath39 .",
    "the fact that the radio source is small and young and expanding might represent another piece of evidence in support to this picture .      at a redshift of @xmath40",
    ", 3c292 is the nearest source in our small sample .",
    "for this reason we can better separate the x - ray components spatially .    the spectral properties of the core of 3c 292 reveal an absorbed component which probably indicates a hidden quasar . with the pn camera ,",
    "we also detect soft emission , and the normalisation of this component ( 0.13 njy ) supports the interpretation to be a soft radio - related emission from the core . the derived 0.2 - 10 kev flux ( 1.3@xmath41  erg  s@xmath2",
    "@xmath5 ) is in agreement with the rosat - derived flux - flux correlation for radio / x - ray cores ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) .",
    "we have evidence for the presence of extended x - ray emission .",
    "most of it is spatially correlated with the radio lobes , but we detected an additional extended component that we interpret as arising from a hot , cluster - like environment , and detect spatially out to a distance of 0.7 mpc ( 100 arcsec ) from the centre of the radio galaxy .",
    "our best - fitting temperature , k@xmath42 = 2.2 kev , and bolometric luminosity , @xmath43 = 6.5@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , place the cluster slightly above , but consistent with , the @xmath24 relation for clusters at @xmath44 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "the spatial correlation between radio and x - ray emission , at the position of the radio lobes , strongly supports ic scattering as the physical process responsible for the x - ray emission aligned with the radio structure .",
    "the larger spatial extent of the radio emission can be explained by lifetime effects .    however , some doubts arise on a pure non - thermal origin because a thermal model is a good fit to the data , and there is some evidence for line fe l and fe k emission .",
    "let us assume that the x - ray lobes emit thermally and their temperature is 5.3 kev , to be compared to a 2 kev temperature of the gaseous environment as obtained from the spectrum extracted on larger scales and by excluding the lobe x - ray emission .",
    "a possible physical interpretation in this case is that the gas surrounding the radio lobes has been shocked by the expansion of the radio jet , as observed in the nearby source cen a ( kraft et al . 2003 ) .",
    "if this is the case , we are observing this phenomenon at high redshift for the first time .",
    "although this effect is difficult to quantify , some contamination from the core via the wings of the psf could contribute to artificially increasing the temperature , if a thermal model is adopted .",
    "on the other hand , the adoption of ic scattering as the physical model to explain the x - ray emission is also supported by requiring the radio plasma to be only within a factor of 2 of equipartition .    under the simple assumption that the cluster is described by an isothermal @xmath18-model",
    ", we estimate that the pressure of the external medium at the distance of the radio lobes ( 2.5@xmath15 pa ) and the pressure in the radio lobes ( 7.9@xmath15 pa ) are of the same order , suggesting equilibrium of the radio - galaxy lobes with the external environment .",
    "the poor statistics do not allow us to constrain well the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "we have a detection , with each of the three cameras , and we observe a correspondence between the x - ray emission and the radio emission from the galaxy .",
    "there is an interesting correlation between the southern hotspot and the x - ray southern peak of the emission , while the northern hotspot is 10 arcsec   ( 85 kpc ) from the northern x - ray peak .",
    "however , the estimated ssc x - ray emission for hotspots is negligible with respect to the estimated ic emission from the lobes . despite our reservations concerning the spectral fitting ,",
    "the good agreement between the x - ray flux estimated at 1 kev by adopting a single power - law model with @xmath17=1.6 and the expected ic flux from the lobes supports the ic interpretation .",
    "if we interpret the soft emission as thermal and due to a cluster environment , our spectral results would lead to a temperature ( 1.4 kev ) and x - ray luminosity ( 1.5@xmath45 erg s@xmath2 ) , consistent with the @xmath46 relation when evolution is considered ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "core emission from this source is not obviously detected , and a second component to fit the spectrum is not required . however ,",
    "if the hard spectrum is fitted , analogously to 3c292 and 3c184 with an absorbed power law , we obtain similar absorption and photon index as for the other two sources .",
