    "models for accretion onto a black hole ( bh ) have been discussed now for more than 40 years . during the last 1015 years we have seen a dramatic increase in the amount of information on the bh x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) .",
    "spectral details ( iron lines and compton reflection ) , spectral transitions , and variability on various time scales has been studied in unprecedented details with the new generation x - ray telescopes such as _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ and _ xmm - newton_. excellent recent reviews are devoted to these advances @xcite .",
    "in addition to the x - ray data , we have seen an explosion of information coming from other wavelengths : radio , sub - mm , infrared , optical , uv , mev and nowadays even from the gev range .",
    "what is even more spectacular is that the properties of the bhs at these other wavebands are correlated with the x - ray flux and x - ray states . among the most impressive achievements we find the discovery of correlated fast variability in the optical / infrared ( oir ) band and in the x - rays @xcite with some hints actually coming already 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "this got theoreticians to scratch their heads and invent new models that often were in disagreement with previously established theories and contradicted many other available data .    here",
    "we discuss some of the recent discoveries .",
    "we would like to note that the time for theoretical ( phenomenological ) models based purely on spectral properties are long gone . in order to be considered seriously , any model has to address many observed facts together .",
    "this review consists of two parts . in the first one , we discuss the most recent reincarnation of the hot flow model , which now also considers the role of the non - thermal particles . in the second part",
    ", we discuss recent observational advances .",
    "we review the spectral data in various energy bands concentrating on the x - rays and the oir .",
    "then we discuss the observed temporal properties and correlated variability in different energy bands , as well as more complicated temporal - spectral statistics such as fourier resolved spectra . in this review",
    "we will concentrate on the hard state and interpret the observations in terms of the hot flow model .",
    "at high accretion rates exceeding typically 10% of the eddington value , bhs are in the `` soft state '' and have thermally looking spectra peaking in the standard 210 kev x - ray band , which are consistent with the thin @xmath1-disc model @xcite .",
    "these thermally - dominated spectra presumably depend only on the accretion rate , the bh mass and spin and the inclination .",
    "they potentially can be used to determine the bh spin if the distance to the source and e.g. the bh mass and inclination are known ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , often strong power - law tails are seen ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tail_cygx1 ] ) .",
    "this tails are interpreted as a signature of non - thermal `` corona '' atop of the standard shakura - sunyaev disc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]b ) .    at the lower accretion rate , bhs",
    "are often found in the `` hard state '' and their spectra do not even remotely look thermal , but are close to the power - law in the x - ray band with a sharp cutoff at about 100 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found an approximate relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the comptonized spectra : @xmath8 where @xmath9 for bhbs and @xmath10 for agns and the typical seed photon temperatures of 0.2 kev for bhbs and 5 ev for agns were assumed .",
    "if indeed the disc photons are being comptonized , we get @xmath11 for bhbs in their hard state .",
    "this fact puts serious constraints on the geometry of the emission region @xcite and immediately rules out simple slab - corona models which predict much smaller amplification @xmath12 and softer spectra because of the efficient x - ray reprocessing in the cold disc @xcite . assuming that coronal plasma has a mildly relativistic velocity away from the cold disc @xcite one can in principle reconcile that model with the observed slopes as well as with the correlated changes of the spectral hardness and the amount of compton reflection from the disc , but still one would have troubles explaining their correlations with the iron line width and characteristic variability frequencies ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "if the accretion flow geometry is such that the inner part is occupied by the hot flow and the outer is the standard cold disc , the seed photons for comptonization might be internal to the hot flow or come from the outer disc . for the truncation radius of the cold disc of more than 30@xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius ) ,",
    "most of the disc photons go directly to the observer and therefore the disc should be very prominent in the total spectrum . furthermore , the luminosity in disc photons being comptonized in the region of major gravitational energy release ( @xmath15 ) would be only about 1% of the total luminosity resulting in an amplification factor of a hundred and a very hard comptonization spectrum ( see equation  [ eq : gamma_delta ] ) . neither is observed .",
    "an overlap of the inner hot flow with the cold disc ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]a ) was proposed as a solution to this , but does not really solve the problem , because most of the energy is dissipated within 10@xmath13 .",
    "thus the disc should come to radii below @xmath16 .",
    "another solution is that cold clouds embedded into the flow reprocess hard photons @xcite increasing thus the number of seed soft photons .",
    "alternatively , the hot flow itself can generate enough soft photons by synchrotron emission of the same hot electrons that emit the x - rays , if the electron temperature @xmath17 is sufficiently high to overcome the self - absorption problem .",
    "the spectrum from the hot optically thin advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) indeed is produced mostly by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "detailed radiative transfer calculations accounting for non - local compton effect coupled with dynamics ( also in the kerr metric ) predict , however , @xmath17 exceeding the observed values of 50100 kev by at least a factor of 2 ( see fig .  3 in @xcite , fig .",
    "1d in @xcite and figs .  5 and 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "most of the problems get solved if the electrons have a reasonably strong non - thermal tail . in this case ,",
    "synchrotron emission becomes much more efficient @xcite increasing the cooling , softening the spectrum and lowering @xmath17 to the values which agree with observations .",
    "this is the essence of the hybrid comptonization ( or rather hybrid ssc ) models developed for bright accreting bhs @xcite that are described below in more details .",
    "non - thermal electrons can also play a role in low - luminosity systems such as sgr a * @xcite .",
    "however , in these conditions the equilibrium electron temperature is very high ( @xmath18 mev ) and the optical depth is very low , so that thermal synchrotron radiation is very effective .",
    "the role of the non - thermal electrons is then reduced to production of tails at higher and lower frequencies around the dominating thermal synchrotron peak .",
    "arguments in favour of the presence of non - thermal particles in the accretion flow come from the significant detection of the mev tails in the hard state spectra of cyg x-1 ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : tail_cygx1 ] ) and are well described by non - thermal / hybrid comptonization @xcite .",
    "what is the nature of the non - thermal particles is an open question .",
    "on the theoretical ground , it is expected that the electrons get some of the energy via coulomb collisions with hot , nearly virial protons ( as assumed in adaf models ) or diffusive acceleration by mhd turbulence , resulting in  thermal heating \" , i.e. energy is transferred to the thermal population of electrons .",
    "however , some fraction of the energy can be transferred to them in the form of injection of relativistic electrons by shock acceleration @xcite , magnetic reconnection @xcite , or electron - position pair production by decay of pions born in proton - proton collisions @xcite . because the microphysics of electron acceleration and heating in the hot flow is not well established from first principles",
    ", one can use a phenomenological prescription , where some fraction of the total power is given to the electrons as heating and the rest of the energy is given by non - thermal injection of power - law electrons .",
    "such hybrid thermal / non - thermal models are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "models with the least number of free parameters are either purely thermal or purely non - thermal . because the first option clearly contradicts the data , we consider in the following the second non - thermal option .",
    "of course , the assumption that the electrons receive 100% of their energy in the form of non - thermal injection is not realistic . fortunately , the results are not very sensitive to the actual value of non - thermal injection fraction as long as it exceeds 10% ( see appendix b1 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the reason is that even for pure non - thermal injection the steady - state electron distribution is thermal at low energies due to thermalisation via coulomb collisions between electrons as well as via synchrotron self - absorption @xcite . at higher energies a tail develops ,",
    "whose shape is determined by the injection and the competition between various cooling / thermalisation mechanisms .",
    "the most advanced hybrid models solve simultaneously for the momentum distribution of all considered particles , electrons and positrons ( sometimes also protons ) , as well as the photons .",
    "this either can be done via monte - carlo simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by solving coupled kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "the processes that need to be accounted for under the conditions of the hot flows are compton scattering , synchrotron emission and absorption , pair production , coulomb collisions ( between leptons as well as with protons ) , and bremsstrahlung . the radiative transfer can be easily handled exactly with monte - carlo approach , while usually with the kinetic approach an escape probability formalism in a single - zone approximation is used .",
    "a single - zone approximation works reasonably well if most of the escaping radiation at all wavelengths is dominated by some narrow range of radii . for the x - ray production",
    "this is fine , because most of the energy is dissipated in the accretion flow spread from say 3@xmath13 to 10@xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", this approximation fails in the oir . here",
    "the outer zones of the hot flow can dominate the energy output in those bands as the inner zones are opaque for that radiation . because the radiation from the inner zones can affect the energy balance and the escaping radiation from the outer zones , a multi - zone treatment with the radiative transfer is required @xcite .",
    "the simplest model is described by the size , the magnetic field strength @xmath20 , thomson optical depth @xmath21 , the total injected power @xmath3 , the spectrum of the injected electrons and the spectrum and luminosity of the external ( blackbody / cold accretion disc ) photons . for",
    "an extended multi - zone flow one can assume that the electron energy injection rate as well as @xmath20 and @xmath21 have power - law distributions with radius , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and thus the additional parameters , e.g. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 have to be introduced .",
    "many parameters can be directly determined from observations or taken from theoretical accretion disc models .",
    "now let us describe the main properties of such hybrid models .",
    "if the truncation radius of the cold disc is significantly larger than the region of the major energy dissipation ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , then the x - ray spectrum is dominated by the radiation from the innermost zone of the hot flow . here",
    "locally generated non - thermal synchrotron photons are comptonized by the thermal electron population ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ssc_decomp]a ) . here",
    "we note that the internally generated synchrotron photons are much more efficient in cooling the plasma than the external disc photons .",
    "the first obvious difference comes from the geometry : all synchrotron photons are injected within the hot flow and have a chance to be comptonized , while in the disc case only a small fraction gets to the hot flow .",
    "the second difference comes from the fact that the synchrotron photons have much smaller energies than the cold disc photons .",
    "therefore , in order to produce the same spectral slope of the comptonization continuum ( with nearly the same total power ) , the synchrotron luminosity can be smaller by a factor a several than the disc luminosity intercepted by the hot flow .",
    "in other words , the amplification factor given by equation  ( [ eq : gamma_delta ] ) is now closer to 50 than 10 ( because we need to use @xmath27 ) .    at a few per cent of the eddington luminosity corresponding to the bright hard state",
    ", the low - energy electrons are thermalised by coulomb collisions and synchrotron self - absorption to the typical electron temperatures @xmath17 of about 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the hybrid model produces surprisingly stable spectra with photon index @xmath281.8 largely independent of the model parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssc_decomp]a ) .",
    "the high - energy electron tail can be approximated by a power - law , which is softer than the injected distribution due to the cooling .",
    "the observed mev tail is produced by compton up scattering of the 100 kev photons by these non - thermal electrons .",
    "the outer zones of the hot flow have softer spectra because of the additional cooling by the cold disc photons and because of more transparent conditions for the synchrotron radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ssc_decomp]b ) .",
    "the overall x - ray spectrum is thus concave .",
    "the oir spectrum consists of two components : the multi - colour ( possibly irradiated ) cold accretion disc and the synchrotron radiation from the hot flow .",
    "similarly to the inhomogeneous synchrotron models developed for extragalactic jets @xcite , the non - thermal synchrotron spectrum of the hot flow is a power - law @xmath29 with the index @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath25 are the indices of the equilibrium distribution of electrons , @xmath32 , at lorentz factor @xmath33 emitting at the self - absorption frequency .",

    "the question now arises how it is possible that the x - rays and oir / uv vary at the same frequency and are phase - connected ?",
    "this fact finds a simple explanation in the hybrid hot flow model because the hot flow can precess as a solid body ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : xray_variab ] ) and therefore the long wavelength emission produced in the outer part of that flow is related to the x - rays produced in the inner part of the same flow @xcite .",

    "synchrotron jet emission from non - thermal electrons in a highly ordered magnetic field can have a large polarisation degree ( up to @xmath1870 per cent ) in the optically thin part of the spectrum , and indeed a high polarisation in the radio and the optical bands reaching 3050 per cent is observed from extragalactic relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario also needs a very hard electron spectrum as well as an extreme fine - tuning to reproduce the spectral cutoff at a few mev @xcite . in the hot - flow scenario ,",
    "the mev photons are produced by non - thermal compton scattering of the 100 kev photons by electrons with lorentz factors @xmath33@xmath1824 .",
    "these electrons can not be isotropic , because no significant polarisation is expected in that case @xcite .",
    "this then implies that they must have nearly one - dimensional motion , e.g. along the large - scale magnetic field lines threading the flow .",
    "the @xmath89 offset of the polarisation vector relative to the jet axis then implies the inclined field lines .",
    "if the measured high polarisation degree is indeed real , this would put strong constraints on the physics of particle acceleration in the hot flow and the magnetic field geometry .    in the oir bands",
    ", polarisation is very small and does not exceed a few per cent @xcite . in the hot - flow scenario , polarisation degree of the optically thin synchrotron radiation in the oir band is expected to be essentially zero ( independently of the magnetic field geometry ) because the faraday rotation angle exceeds @xmath91",
    "rad @xcite . in the optically thick regime , the intrinsic polarisation ( parallel to the magnetic field lines )",
    "is not more than about 10 per cent even for the ordered magnetic field @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation in the disc atmosphere can still essentially depolarise that emission .",
    "the reprocessed emission from the outer disc can be slightly polarised because magnetic field there is smaller .",
    "if the jet were responsible for the oir emission , one would expect instead a much higher polarisation because its radiation is optically thin , not consistent with the data .",
    "the observed small polarisation can also be produced by dust / electron scattering in the source vicinity or by the interstellar dust .",
    "the purely thermal hot - flow model was shown to be consistent with many x - ray characteristics . however , that model fails to account for the mev tails and a number of oir properties .",

    "the jet is obviously a better model for those data .",
    "we , however , struggle to find any other observational fact that could be in conflict with the hybrid hot flow  truncated cold disc scenario .",
    "recently , the jet paradigm became popular and it was claimed that the jets are responsible not only for the radio emission from the bhbs , but also the oir and even the x - ray emission .",
    "unfortunately , that model is in contradiction with dozens of observed facts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which are usually ignored by the model proponents . when new data appear , they often are rather puzzling and difficult to understand within the available paradigms",
    ". however , it would be beneficial for the community when introducing brand new models to check also whether those models satisfy other observational constraints .    in spite of a serious progress in understanding of the viscosity in accretion discs around bhs",
    ", there are still many open questions . if non - thermal particles are present in the hot flow , it is now time to understand what is their nature .",
    "how are they accelerated : in shocks or in magnetic reconnections events , or maybe via diffusive acceleration by mhd turbulence ? how are they related to the magneto - rotational instability that presumably drives the accretion ?",

    "<S> the general picture that emerged by the end of 1990s from a large set of optical and x - ray , spectral and timing data was that the x - rays are produced in the innermost hot part of the accretion flow , while the optical / infrared ( oir ) emission is mainly produced by the irradiated outer thin accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> recent multiwavelength observations of galactic black hole transients show that the situation is not so simple . </S>",
    "<S> fast variability in the oir band , oir excesses above the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the x - ray and the oir light curves imply that the oir emitting region is much more compact . </S>",
    "<S> one of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the oir emission and even is responsible for the bulk of the x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> however , this scenario is largely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the hot accretion flow , known to be consistent with the x - ray spectral and timing data , is also a viable candidate to produce the oir radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the hot - flow scenario naturally explains the power - law like oir spectra , fast oir variability and its complex relation to the x - rays if the hot flow contains non - thermal electrons ( even in energetically negligible quantities ) , which are required by the presence of the mev tail in cyg  x-1 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of non - thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron temperature in the hot flow model to @xmath0 kev , making it more consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> here we argue that any viable model should simultaneously explain a large set of spectral and timing data and show that the hybrid ( thermal / non - thermal ) hot flow model satisfies most of the constraints . </S>"
