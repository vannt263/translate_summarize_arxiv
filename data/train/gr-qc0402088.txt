    "the equation of motion of a neutral test body reads in the presence of the @xmath0-field @xmath4 where the geodesic equation is recovered in the case of a non variable @xmath0-field . in the weak fields and low velocity limit , assuming spherical symmetry and circular orbits , the rotational velocity , @xmath5 , at radius @xmath6",
    "is then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant which would represent the angular momentum per unit mass if the @xmath0-field were not present within the galaxy .",
    "assuming that the excitation of the @xmath0-field is very small compared to its vacuum expectation value , @xmath9 , the equation of the @xmath0-field reads in the first approximation @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the source of the @xmath0-field , @xmath12 is the einstein gravitational constant and @xmath13 a universal dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "hence , one gets for a static spherical matter distribution @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the mass density of the matter fields other than the @xmath0-field itself . assuming in addition a sufficiently thin disk ( stellar plus gaseous disks ) and a ( quasi - isothermal ) spherical dark halo with mass density such that @xmath16 the static spherical solution of @xmath0 is found proportional to @xmath17 ( up to the vacuum expectation value ) within the galaxy out of the bulge .",
    "hence , the rotational velocity reads @xmath18 where the functions @xmath19 are defined as follows @xmath20}.\\ ] ] for our purpose , @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , this is one of the two necessary conditions for the @xmath0-field mimics a dark matter mass profile ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , the greater is the integer @xmath3 , the steepest is the curve @xmath23 versus @xmath24 for @xmath25 and the flatest it is for @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the steepest is a rc below the turnover radius , the flatest it should be beyond .",
    "figure 2 shows some fits to individual rotation curves ( from the samples of rubin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , van albada _",
    "@xcite , lake and van gorkom @xcite ) .",
    "this is achieved by using the least - squares fit to search the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 that yield the maximum square , @xmath29 , of the correlation coefficient for the relation @xmath30 .",
    "as yet , based on the study of a hundred spirals , it is found that @xmath27 is always negative ( this is the other necessary condition for the @xmath0-field mimics a dark matter mass profile ) whereas @xmath31 is always positive .",
    "in addition , one gets approximately the following statistics : @xmath32 for @xmath33% of the spirals , @xmath34 for almost a half of them and @xmath35 for @xmath36% of them .",
    "figure 3 shows our new result : there is a strong correlation between the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath31 .",
    "though displayed here for only fifteen spirals , this remains true for the whole sample of a hundred spirals we have studied hitherto .",
    "hence , if a natural theoretical explanation is found in the future , only two independent parameters will be needed to fit the rc with the proposed model one of which is just an integer .",
    "it is possible that long range scalar fields external to gravity play a significant role not only at the cosmological level but also at the scale of galaxies or even the solar system @xcite ."

    "<S> in a previous work @xcite , we have modelled the rotation curves ( rc ) of spiral galaxies by including in the equation of motion dynamical terms from an external real self - interacting scalar field , @xmath0 , minimally coupled to gravity and which respects the equivalence principle in the absence of electromagnetic fields . this model appears to have three free parameters : the turnover radius , @xmath1 , the maximum rotational velocity , @xmath2 , plus a strictly positive integer , @xmath3 . here , the coupling of the @xmath0-field to other kinds of matter is emphasized at the expense of its self - interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this reformulation presents the very advantageous possibility that the same potential may be used now for all galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> new correlations are established . </S>"
