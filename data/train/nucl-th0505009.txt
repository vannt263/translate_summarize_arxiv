    "hadron production in high energy lepton scattering off nuclear targets provides an ideal tool to study the physics of hadronization @xcite . in elementary electron - proton reactions nothing can be learned about the space - time picture of hadron formation , since the reaction products hadronize long before they reach the detector . in nuclear reactions the nucleus serves as a kind of micro - detector which is located directly behind the primary @xmath0 interaction point .",
    "the attenuation of produced hadrons in the nucleus compared to a proton or deuterium target then yields combined information on the length scales of hadron formation and the strength of the prehadronic final state interactions ( fsi ) .    in the recent past the hermes collaboration @xcite has carried out a detailed study of hadron production in deep inelastic lepton scattering on various gas targets using the 27.6 gev positron ( electron ) beam at desy .",
    "the observed attenuation of produced hadrons has led to two complementary interpretations : in refs .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that hadronization occurs far outside the nucleus and that the attenuation of high energy hadrons is solely caused by a partonic energy loss .",
    "here the struck quark undergoes multiple scattering while propagating through the nucleus giving rise to induced gluon radiation . on the other hand refs .",
    "@xcite are based on the idea that the struck quark forms a color neutral prehadron early after the initial @xmath0 interaction and that the prehadronic fsi modify the multiplicity spectra of hadrons .",
    "the authors of refs .  @xcite treat the fsi purely absorptive and restrict their considerations to direct interactions of the virtual photon with valence quarks inside the nucleus . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have developed a method to incorporate quantum mechanical coherence length effects observed in high - energy photon - nucleus reactions into our semi - classical buu transport model .",
    "this enables us to account for direct _ and _ resolved photon - nucleus interactions and to provide a probabilistic coupled - channel treatment of the ( pre-)hadronic fsi .",
    "furthermore , our monte carlo approach allows for realistic event - by - event simulations that can either be corrected for detector efficiencies or which can directly be used as input for detector simulations . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have applied our model to hadron attenuation at hermes and emc energies and in ref .",
    "@xcite we also made first predictions for the kinematic regime of the current jlab experiments .",
    "besides making an essential contribution to our understanding of hadronization , electroproduction off complex nuclei also provides useful input for the interpretation of observables in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . in the latter case",
    "the system passes through various energy and density phases and the collision geometry is much less under control than for lepton - nucleus scattering where the target remains more or less in its ground state throughout the reaction .",
    "the hadron formation lengths extracted from electron - nucleus reactions help to clarify to what extend the recently observed quenching of high transverse momentum hadrons in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic is due to partonic energy loss in a quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "in our model we split the lepton - nucleus reaction into two parts : in the first step the exchanged virtual photon interacts with a bound nucleon inside the nucleus , thereby producing a prehadronic final state which  in step two  is propagated in our buu transport model .    in the initial @xmath0 interaction",
    "we account for nuclear effects such as binding energies and fermi motion of the bound nucleons as well as pauli blocking for outgoing fermions .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the wave function modifications of the resolved photon components , i.e.  the vector meson and perturbative @xmath2-fluctuations , on the path through the nucleus up to the primary production point . as a result",
    "the nucleons on the front side of the nucleus shadow the downstream nucleons from resolved photon interactions at large coherence lengths @xcite .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] for a @xmath1kr nucleus and a high - energy virtual photon with momentum directed along the positive @xmath3-axis and a @xmath4 coherence length of the order of the nuclear radius .     and energy @xmath5 with nucleons in a @xmath1kr nucleus . ]    the product of the high - energy @xmath0 interaction",
    "is determined by the event generators pythia @xcite and fritiof @xcite which allows us i ) to account for direct interactions of the bare virtual photon with sea and valence quarks inside the nucleon and ii ) also for the resolved photon interactions . in the latter case",
    "the hadronic fluctuations of the photon can participate in a hard or a diffractive scattering process with the nucleon .",
    "all scatterings lead to the excitations of hadronic strings which subsequently decay according to the lund fragmentation scheme @xcite into color neutral prehadrons . in this work",
    "we assume that these prehadrons are produced directly after the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "this is a simplifying assumption that is generally used in transport models @xcite .",
    "the prehadrons then need a formation time to build up their hadronic wave function and to interact like physical hadrons . for simplicity",
    "we take the formation time to be a universal constant @xmath6 fm/@xmath7 in the rest frame of each hadron .",
    "this corresponds approximately to the time that the hadron constituents need to travel a distance of a typical hadronic radius .",
    "furthermore , it is in agreement with formation times that have been extracted from particle production in @xmath8 collisions at ags energies within a similar transport model @xcite . during their formation time",
    "the prehadrons are assumed to interact with reduced cross sections which are determined by the number @xmath9 of _ leading _ ( anti-)quarks that were initially present either in the target nucleon or the hadronic fluctuation of the photon : @xmath10 consequently , the hadrons that contain leading quarks , i.e. the beam and target remnants , interact with a ( reduced ) cross section right after the @xmath0 interaction while the prehadrons that solely contain ( anti)quarks produced from the vacuum in the string fragmentation will start to interact after their formation time @xmath11 .",
    "the propagation of the final state ( pre)hadrons through the nucleus is described by our buu transport model .",
    "the model is based on a set of generalized transport equations which determines the time evolution of the spectral phase - space distributions @xmath12 of the ( pre)hadrons .",
    "the distributions @xmath13 give at each moment of time @xmath14 and for each particle class @xmath15 the probability to find a particle of that class with a ( possibly off - shell ) mass @xmath16 and momentum @xmath17 at position @xmath18 .",
    "its time - development is given by the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the relativistic energy of the ( pre)hadron @xmath15 and contains a momentum- and density - dependent mean - field potential in case of baryons .",
    "the terms on the lhs of ( @xmath21 ) are the so - called _ drift terms _ since they describe the independent transport of each hadron class @xmath15 .",
    "the terms on the rhs of ( @xmath21 ) are the _ collision terms _ ; they describe both elastic and inelastic collisions between the hadrons . here",
    "the term inelastic collisions includes those collisions that either lead to particle production or particle absorption .",
    "the former is described by the gain term @xmath22 on the rhs in ( @xmath21 ) , the latter process ( absorption ) by the loss term @xmath23 .",
    "note that the gain term is proportional to the spectral function @xmath24 of the particle being produced , thus allowing for production of off - shell particles . on the contrary ,",
    "the loss term is proportional to the spectral phase space distribution itself : the more particles there are the more can be absorbed .",
    "the terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the rhs give the actual strength of the gain and loss terms , respectively .",
    "they have the form of born - approximation collision integrals and take the pauli - principle into account .",
    "the free collision rates themselves are taken from experiment or are calculated @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have presented a detailed comparison of our model results and experimental data from the hermes experiment . in this work",
    "we review our major findings .    in our simulations",
    "we apply the same kinematic cuts as in the hermes experiment and in addition account for the geometrical acceptance of the hermes detector .",
    "the first observable that we discuss is the so called multiplicity ratio @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the yield of semi - inclusive hadrons in a given @xmath29-bin and @xmath30 the yield of inclusive deep inelastic scattering leptons in the same @xmath5-bin .",
    "like in experiment we define the hadron fractional energy as @xmath31 and denote the transverse hadron momentum component with respect to the virtual photon momentum as @xmath32 . for the deuterium target ,",
    "i.e.  the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicity - ratio ] ) , we simply use the isospin averaged results of a proton and a neutron target .",
    "thus in the case of deuterium we neglect the fsi of the produced hadrons and also the effect of shadowing and fermi motion .",
    "the latter will be accounted for in an upcoming work .    , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for a @xmath1kr nucleus ( when using a 27.6 gev positron beam at hermes ) as a function of the hadron energy fraction @xmath31 and the photon energy @xmath5 .",
    "the solid line represents the result of a simulation , where we use the constituent quark concept ( [ eq : prehadrons ] ) for the prehadronic cross sections and a formation time @xmath6 fm/@xmath7 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the result of a simulation where the fsi have been treated purely absorptive .",
    "the data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : krid ] shows the multiplicity ratio ( [ eq : multiplicity - ratio ] ) for the production of pions , ( anti-)kaons and ( anti-)protons on a @xmath1kr target .",
    "the solid line represents the result of our coupled - channel buu calculation using an universal formation propertime @xmath6 fm/@xmath7 and our simple constituent quark concept ( [ eq : prehadrons ] ) . as we have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the increase of @xmath36 with photon energy @xmath5 is not solely caused by an increase of time dilatation but may in parts be due to the geometrical acceptance of the hermes detector which is restricted to the forward region . the increase of hadron attenuation with rising fractional hadron energy @xmath37 arises from the fact that a high @xmath37 ( pre)hadron most likely contains a leading quark and therefore might get absorbed early after the @xmath0 interaction . furthermore , the elastic and inelastic fsi shuffle strength from higher to lower ( fractional ) energies as can be seen by comparing to a calculation without coupled - channel treatment ( dashed line ) . in the latter case",
    "we simply remove all particles that have undergone a collision from the outgoing channel .",
    "as expected the discrepancy is largest at small @xmath37 .",
    "one also sees that the coupled - channel treatment leads to an increasing yield of low energy protons that are knocked out of the nucleus in the fsi",
    ". however , the kinematic cuts reduce this increase in such a way that we still overestimate the attenuation of protons .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : krid ] one sees that the absorption strength is about the same for kaons and anti - kaons .",
    "this is due to the following effects : because of reactions like @xmath38 the absorption cross section of @xmath39 is larger than that of @xmath40 .",
    "this is partly compensated by a reduction of the prehadronic interactions .",
    "this is due to a smaller probability to form a leading @xmath41 in the primary @xmath0 interaction , since now the photon has either to interact directly with a sea quark inside the nucleon or undergo a resolved interaction . furthermore , there exists the possibility to create @xmath42 through reactions like @xmath43 in the fsi .    the hermes collaboration has also measured the @xmath32-dependence of the multiplicity ratio ( [ eq : multiplicity - ratio ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : krpt ] for a @xmath1kr target in comparison to our buu calculation indicated by the solid line .",
    "obviously , the experimental multiplicity ratio shows a strong increase at transverse momenta above 1  gev which can be seen as the cronin effect in @xmath44 collisions and which is not reproduced by our ( pre)hadronic fsi .",
    "in addition to our standard approach  which uses the vacuum cross sections as input for determining the outcome of the rescatterings in the fsi  we have also performed a calculation where we assumed all elastic scatterings in the fsi to be isotropic ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : krpt ] ) .",
    "the latter leads to an increase of the theoretical multiplicity ratio at high transverse momenta , however it overestimates the total strength of the attenuation ! the cronin effect in @xmath44 collisions therefore should have a partonic origin which might either be due to partonic rescattering in the fsi , an increase of the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath45 of the resolved photon components on their way through the nucleus  an initial state effect  or an increase of @xmath45 in the bound target nucleons .",
    "kr ( at hermes ) as a function of the transverse momentum squared @xmath46 . in the simulation we use the constituent quark concept ( [ eq : prehadrons ] ) for the prehadronic cross sections and a formation time @xmath6 fm/@xmath7 . in the simulation indicated by the dashed line",
    "we additionally assume that all elastic scatterings are isotropic in their center - of - mass frame .",
    "the data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    finally , we discuss the double - hadron attenuation that has recently been measured at hermes @xcite . in each event only the two ( charged _ or _",
    "neutral ) hadrons with the highest energies are considered . in the following",
    "we denote the hadron with the highest @xmath37 as the leading hadron and the other one as the subleading hadron .",

    "we account for all experimental cuts and the geometrical acceptance of the hermes detector in our simulation .",
    "[ fig : double ] shows our model prediction for the double - hadron multiplicity ratio ( [ eq : double - hadron ] ) for @xmath53n , @xmath1kr and @xmath54xe . to exclude contributions from @xmath4 decay into @xmath55 the charge combinations @xmath56 and @xmath57 have been excluded both in experiment and in the simulation .",
    "the solid line shows the result of a full coupled - channel calculation using the constituent quark concept ( [ eq : prehadrons ] ) and the formation time @xmath6 fm/@xmath7 .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is similar to that of @xmath58 of the single hadron multiplicity ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : krid ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] , our calculations predict about the same double - hadron attenuation ratio for @xmath54xe and @xmath1kr . as we explain below the attenuation of leading and double hadrons increases in the same way when going from the krypton to the xenon target .",
    "hence , the double - hadron attenuation ratio ( [ eq : double - hadron ] ) stays roughly the same .",
    "note , that this does not necessarily imply the same single - hadron attenuation for @xmath1kr and @xmath54xe . as we have shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the single - hadron attenuation ( [ eq : multiplicity - ratio ] ) in the @xmath54xe nucleus is larger than for @xmath1kr .    to understand the behavior of the double - hadron multiplicity ratio ( [ eq : double - hadron ] ) qualitatively we consider a simple absorption model ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : double2 ] ) differ by the absorption cross section in the exponent which for the case of double - hadrons is twice the cross section for the single hadron absorption .",
    "hence , @xmath70 is smaller than one for pure absorption and depends only very weakly on the mass number @xmath64 of the target nucleus , since the @xmath64-dependence of the numerator and the denominator are about the same .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] shows the result of our buu model for a purely absorptive treatment of the fsi .",
    "the increase of @xmath73 with decreasing @xmath74 is obviously due to the coupled - channel effects : for the interpretation we discard for a moment the constant factors @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : double - hadron ] ) and the factors @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicity - ratio ] ) which have no influence on the shape of the @xmath37 dependence .",
    "the only difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 then is that one restricts the detected hadron to the subleading particle in the latter case .",
    "if the subleading particle ( with energy fraction @xmath74 ) of the initial @xmath0 reaction interacts with the nuclear environment , it will produce a bunch of low - energy particles .",

    "we have presented a model which combines a quantum mechanical treatment of coherence length effects in high - energy ( virtual ) photon - nucleus interactions with a probabilistic coupled - channel description of hadronic fsi .",
    "this allows us to model hadron electro- and photoproduction off complex nuclei at multi gev energies in a way that goes far beyond simple absorption models .",
    "furthermore , the model can be used with basically the same parameters and physics assumption to describe a broad range of different nuclear reactions such as pion and proton induced reactions as well as heavy - ion - collisions .    in this work we have compared our model results to experimental data on single- and double - hadron multiplicity ratios in deep inelastic positron scattering off nuclear targets at hermes .",
    "we achieve a good description of most experimental data by assuming early interactions of color neutral prehadrons that are produced in the initial @xmath0 interaction and account for particle absorption _ and _ production in the fsi",
    ". however , the model underestimates the increase of high transverse momentum hadrons in @xmath44 reactions which may indicate additional partonic effects in the fsi .",
    "we are currently optimizing our model in the hermes kinematic regime by implementing radiative corrections and pythia parameters that have been adjusted by the hermes collaboration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will extend our studies to @xmath44 scattering at jlab @xcite , emc @xcite and eic @xcite energies in the future .",
    "since our model works on an event - by - event basis its output can later on be used for various detector studies .",
