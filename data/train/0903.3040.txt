    "in our milky way galaxy , rr lyrae stars have advanced our understanding of the structures of the halo .",
    "it is clear that the outer regions of the halo are not a smooth distribution , but quite clumpy , and the interpretations suggest that these sub - structures are relics of small satellite galaxies that have been accreted and destroyed by the tidal forces of the milky way @xcite . in order to model and",
    "quantify how important such interactions are in the formation of the halo , fundamental parameters such as the distance to the main body from which the remains of the disruption process originate , are needed . the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr )",
    "is a striking example of a nearby satellite galaxy of the milky way that is currently under the strain of the galactic tidal field @xcite .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been the subject of much debate since its discovery by @xcite .",
    "although the broad consensus is that the sgr is a tidally disrupted satellite distributed across much of the celestial sphere , several major issues remain controversial and intertwined ( see * ? ? ?",
    "advancements in observational constraints can greatly improve models for the interaction of sgr with the milky way and can increase the current understanding of both the milky way and the sgr galaxy .    when modeling the structure of the tidal debris , parameters constrained by observations of stars associated with sgr are incorporated , _",
    "i.e. _ , distances , velocities , surface densities .",
    "the model that best matches the observational data dictates the estimated mass and orbit of the sgr galaxy .",
    "although features in the observational data have been explained by models of the sgr stream ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many conclusions are only tentative , because they rely heavily on the less certain measurements of debris properties .",
    "the absence of data from the sgr galaxy in important regions of the sky has also hampered investigations pertaining to the galactic halo .",
    "for example , @xcite provides simulations of the sgr stream for a range of halo shapes from extreme oblate to prolate , all of which broadly agree with the data available at that time .",
    "the center of sgr has been studied more then any other constituent part .",
    "the properties of the debris emanating from the main body are particularily uncertain and the most subject to speculation .",
    "for example , because the sun lies close enough to sgr orbital plane to be well within the width of the sgr tidal debris stream @xcite , there may be sgr debris close to us .",
    "but this is dependent on where the debris crosses the galactic plane on this side of the galactic center and on the length of the leading arm .",
    "some models ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) derive orbits for sgr that predict current passage of leading arm debris through the galactic plane at a mean distance of @xmath6 4 kpc outside the solar circle , while other models obtain a passage of the center of the leading sgr arm debris within two kilo - parsecs of the sun @xcite .",
    "@xcite use sdss photometry of blue horizontal - branch and f turnoff stars to extrapolate the path of the sgr leading tidal tail and find that it misses the sun by more than 15 kpc .",
    "the tidal debris in the sgr neighborhood is beginning to be traced out .",
    "probably the most complete picture of the sgr stream was obtained by @xcite using m giants selected from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "they could trace out the sgr leading tidal tail reaching toward the north galactic cap and the trailing tidal tail in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "recently , @xcite saw the continuation of the leading tidal trail through the galactic cap and into the galactic plane .",
    "one key in addressing questions about the orbital path of sgr is to determine distances along the stream , and to better define the projected distribution of sgr stars on the sky .",
    "studies of rr lyrae stars have been instrumental in acquiring data of the more obscured regions in the leading tidal tail close to the galactic plane ( cseresnjes , alard & guibert 2000 ; alard 1996 ; alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) . databases like that of macho allow for the study of nearby galaxies , such as the sgr dwarf galaxy , located behind the galactic bulge .",
    "@xcite were the first to use rr0 lyrae stars in the macho database to derive a distance to the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "their analysis is restricted in many ways , particularly since it was based on @xmath6 24 sgr rr0 lyrae stars .",
    "this paper provides a robust distance estimate to the sgr galaxy using @xmath6 200 sgr rr lyrae stars from the macho database .",
    "the procedure used here carefully minimizes systematic and statistical errors and leads to a distance estimate with the smallest formal error to date .",
    "the models of sgr already generated in the literature demonstrate an immense potential for using debris to determine sgr s dynamical history in great detail .",
    "the accurate distance estimate to the northern extension of the sgr galaxy ( in galactic coordinates ) presented here is an important step in constraining sgr models .",
    "the macho project data collection and experiment are described by @xcite and was designed to search for gravitational microlensing events . through the simultaneous imaging of two - color photometry on millions of stars in the lmc , smc , and galactic bulge from 1992 to 1999 ,",
    "many variable stars were also found .",
    "this paper uses the rr0 lyrae stars from the macho bulge fields @xcite with photometry calibrated to johnson @xmath7 and kron - cousins @xmath8 bandpasses following @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that because of the non - standard passbands , the severe \" blending  problems in the fields close to the galactic bulge , and the complexity of the calibration procedures , the absolute photometric calibration of the macho variable stars is a concern . with a microlensing search ,",
    "only differential photometry is needed ; a transformation to the standard system and individual field zero - points are not priority tasks for the survey telescope .",
    "because of these photometry difficulties and in order to avoid systematic effects , the analysis here will be restricted to a differential approach administered on a field by field basis ( _ i.e. _ , determining relative distances between the bulge and sgr in each macho field ) .",
    "an internal precision of @xmath9 mag ( based on 20,000 stars with @xmath10 mag ) is quoted by @xcite .",
    "the sgr stars , however , have @xmath7 magnitudes greater than 18 mag . to determine the internal precision of @xmath11 18 mag , a fourier decomposition is performed on the bulge and sgr rr0 lyrae lightcurves .",
    "the amount that each point in the lightcurve deviates from the fit , @xmath12 , is then calculated .",
    "each lightcurve has between 20 - 700 data points .",
    "the dispersion in the average @xmath12 will give an indication of the internal precision .",
    "the average dispersion in the bulge @xmath13 is 0.06 mags ( based on 613 representative bulge rr0 lyrae stars ) , where the average @xmath7-band magnitude is 16.55 @xmath5 0.47 mags .",
    "the average dispersion in the sgr @xmath13 is 0.08 mags ( based on 175 representative sgr rr0 lyrae stars ) , where the average @xmath7-band magnitude is 18.78 @xmath5 0.28 mags .",
    "a visual inspection of the lightcurves suggests that the reason for a dispersion in @xmath13 that is larger than the published value of the internal precision of 0.021 , is due to a handful largely discrepant points in the rr0 lyrae lightcurve that contribute significantly to the dispersion in @xmath14 .    removing points with @xmath15 , the average dispersion in the bulge",
    "@xmath13 is 0.03 mags . on average ,",
    "6 points per light curve were removed , and the number of photometric measurements in each lightcurve ranges from 18 to 677 points .",
    "for the sgr sample , the average dispersion in the sgr @xmath13 is 0.04 mags .",
    "the average number of points removed per lightcurve is also six , and the sgr lightcurves consist of between 56 to 333 measurements . comparing the dispersion of @xmath12 for the bulge and sgr sample , we can conclude that the sgr internal precision for the macho fields is about 1.5 times as great as that of the macho bulge fields with @xmath1618 mag .",
    "the macho rr0 lyrae sample from @xcite does not have a completeness estimate .",
    "their sample was not intended to be a comprehensive macho bulge rr0 lyrae sample , but rather a representative sample with well - culled and unambiguous rr0 lyrae stars . here",
    "the completeness of the sample is investigated with particular emphasis on the completeness as a function of sgr rr0 lyrae magnitude .",
    "the two fields of @xcite overlap with some of the macho fields .",
    "this allows an independent check on the approximate completeness of the @xcite sample .",
    "field 2 of the @xcite data was first processed and presented by @xcite .",
    "they estimated a completeness limit of @xmath17 @xmath18 20.1 mags , which corresponds to a distance modulus to 18 mags ( 40 kpc ) ; this limit was based on the very numerous ( @xmath67000 ) contact binaries present in the photographic plates .",
    "figure  [ plotone ] shows a histogram of the magnitudes of all 675 macho rr0 lyrae stars that are within 3.6 arc - seconds of one of the field 2 @xcite rr0 lyrae stars .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the @xcite stars matched with the macho rr0 lyrae stars follow the same distribution as the complete field 2 sample .",
    "as the @xcite sgr survey probes much deeper than the stars belonging to the sgr galaxy , this constitutes evidence that the sgr macho rr0 lyrae sample is not magnitude limited to v@xmath619.5 .",
    "the fraction of macho sgr rr0 lyrae stars that can be matched with a @xcite rr0 lyrae star within the magnitude range of @xmath17 15 - 16 mags , is 50% .",
    "this drops slightly to 47% within the @xmath17 16 - 17 magnitude range , to 34% within the @xmath17 17 - 18 magnitude range , and to 45% within the @xmath17 18 - 19 magnitude range .",
    "this suggests that the macho rr0 lyrae sample is at most marginally magnitude limited .",
    "the reason for the lower fraction of macho and @xcite sgr rr0 lyrae stars within the @xmath17 magnitude range that encompasses the transition area ( @xmath17 17 - 18 mag ) between the galactic bulge and sgr galaxy is unclear and could be due to an effect not associated with magnitude ( _ i.e. _ , latitude ) or small number statistics .",
    "if indeed we assume that the sgr rr0 lyrae population contains 5% less stars than the complete sample , then a total of 16 stars , or 10% of the sgr sample is missing due to magnitude limits of the macho survey .",
    "the macho bulge fields barely reach the low galactic latitudes of @xcite field 1",
    ". however , they overlap in a 15@xmath1 x 2.4@xmath1 area . between a right ascension of 18.53 to 18.61h and a declination -29.4 to -27.0@xmath1 there are 145 macho rr0 lyrae stars and 191 @xcite stars .",
    "this field is reported to have a @xmath6 90% extraction completeness and a @xmath6 93% selection completeness , making the macho data in this region 64% complete .",
    "the macho bulge fields cover the majority of @xcite field 2 . between the right ascension of 18.15 to 18.51h and the declination of -31.04@xmath1 to -27.1@xmath1 , there are 1069 macho rr0 lyrae stars and 982 @xcite stars .",
    "their field 2 has a @xmath6 70 % extraction completeness and a @xmath6 85% selection completeness , making the macho data @xmath677% complete in this region .    from the above analysis ,",
    "the macho rr0 lyrae sample used by @xcite is roughly 65% complete .",
    "more importantly , sgr rr0 lyrae population is not magnitude limited to at least @xmath19 20 mag .",
    "the most popular approach to estimate the rr lyrae distances is a linear @xmath20 $ ] relation ( e.g. , krauss & chaboyer 2003 ) .",
    "recently bono , caputo , & di criscienzo ( 2007 ) have shown that this relation is not suitable for the most metal - rich @xmath21 $ } } > -0.7 $ ] dex ) field variables , and further show that over the metallicity range @xmath22<0.0 $ ] the @xmath23 $ ] relation is not linear but has a parabolic behavior : @xmath24 $ } } + 0.09{\\hbox{$ [ { \\rm fe}/{\\rm h}]$ } } ^2 \\label{mvmv}\\ ] ] a number of studies have shown that fourier parameters of light curves of rr0 lyrae stars can be used to find their metallicity with an error of @xmath6 0.2 dex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "employing this technique , @xcite find that the bulge rr0 lyrae stars are on average @xmath6 0.28 @xmath5 0.02 dex more metal rich then the average sgr rr0 lyrae in the macho bulge fields , with @xmath25 $ } } _ { sgr}$]=@xmath261.55 dex .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath6 0.15 mag offset in absolute magnitude , which at the distance of sgr translates into a @xmath6 1.7 kpc error in the distance . in the paper",
    "we use the rr0 lyrae stars with metallicities derived from @xcite so that the metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude in the rr lyrae stars can be taken into account .",
    "the inclusion of the rr lyrae stars metallicity dependence on its absolute magnitude , is in contrast to most previous sgr distance estimates _",
    "@xcite which all assume a constant @xmath27 .",
    "the division of bulge and sgr rr0 lyrae stars in the macho database as determined by @xcite is shown in figure  [ plottwo ] .",
    "again , only the stars with photometric metallicities from @xcite are plotted .",
    "the abscissa is the distance modulus to each star , @xmath4 , using equation  ( 1 ) for absolute magnitude and corrected for extinction , explained later in  4 .",
    "one can clearly see a concentration of stars which represent the rr lyrae stars located in the bulge , and a concentration of stars which represent the sgr galaxy .",
    "however , between the two populations there is some ambiguity as to which population a rr lyrae star truly belongs .",
    "there may also be some rr0 lyrae stars that belong to neither the bulge nor the sgr galaxy , but belong to the halo and thick disk .",
    "the relative distances between the bulge and sgr could be dependent on the samples used ( _ i.e. , _ if brighter bulge stars are included in the sample , the average distance to the bulge would be smaller ) . to ensure a consistent and accurate bulge and sgr sample , the standard deviation of the extinction corrected distance modulus for each population",
    "the stars that are within 2.0 @xmath28 of the mean of each distribution are indicated in figure  [ plottwo ] by symbols with dots in the middle .",
    "other cuts that encompass 1.5@xmath28 and 1.0@xmath28 of each distribution and that include the stars brighter than 19.1 mags are investigated later in this paper .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ plottwo ] that the rr0 lyrae stars in the @xcite sample tend to have a smaller @xmath4 than the majority of the sgr rr lyrae stars used here .",
    "these stars also have galactic latitude values that place them closer to the galactic plane .",
    "hence it is unclear if the @xcite sample is biased to include sgr stars that have on average closer distances , or if sgr rr0 lyrae stars with smaller    of the @xcite sample , the macho rr0 lyrae star sample used in this paper , and a number of other relevant samples from studies with distance estimates to the sgr galaxy , as a function of galactic lattitude and longitude .",
    "the rr0 lyrae stars are binned according to macho field , so the relative distance between the bulge and sgr in each macho field can be found .",
    "although all macho bulge fields contain an ample number of rr0 lyrae stars in the @xcite sample , only the macho fields at lower galactic latitudes ( @xmath29 ) contain a significant amount rr0 lyrae stars that belong to the sgr galaxy .",
    "this analysis is restricted to macho fields containing three or more sgr stars in order to minimize small number statistics and unknown reddenings .",
    "figure  [ plotfour ] and figure  [ plotfive ] show the normalized period and @xmath7-amplitude distribution of the bulge and sgr rr0 lyrae stars in macho fields containing 3 or more sgr stars .",
    "the @xcite period analysis of @xmath63700 rr lyraes distributed between sgr and the milky way found that although the rr lyrae stars in sgr present the shortest average periods among all the dwarf galaxies , their periods are still on average longer than the rr lyrae stars in the galactic center .",
    "this is evident in figure  [ plotfour ] as well .",
    "because the sgr stars are fainter , it would be harder to detect low amplitude stars in the sgr sample .",
    "however , the @xmath7-amplitude distribution of the bulge and sgr stars looks similar , and lends credence to the completeness of the sgr sample . in order to assure that the rr0 lyrae stars in the bulge and the sgr can be inter - compared without any potential bias , the relative distance between the rr0 in the bulge and in sgr is computed here using the rr0 in the bulge covering the same period range as the sgr rr0 lyrae ( _ i.e. _ , 0.46d @xmath30 p @xmath30 0.66d ) .",
    "this period cut has only a minor effect on the of the sample .",
    "figure  [ plotsix ] shows the location of the macho bulge and sgr stars in macho fields with three or more sgr stars and that have the above period range .",
    "there are 288 bulge and 203 sgr rr0 lyrae stars in the macho fields that satisfy these criteria .",
    "the position of the globular cluster , m54 , located at the center of the sgr galaxy is indicated as well as the core radius of the sgr galaxy as traced out from m giants ( assuming an ellipticity of 0.65 and a position angle of 104@xmath31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reddening is patchy in the macho fields toward the bulge , and on large scales , extinction is regularly stratified parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite show that the apparent @xmath32 color of rr0 lyrae stars at minimum @xmath7-band light can be utilized to measure the amount of interstellar reddening along the line of sight to the star since the intrinsic @xmath33 colors at minimum @xmath7-band light seem constant .",
    "they further provide evidence that the intrinsic color at minimum light is very insensitive to metallicity and the blazhko effect .",
    "the reddening values derived from their procedure for the sgr and bulge stars are used here .",
    "the average e(v - r ) for the bulge rr lyrae stars is 0.24 @xmath5 0.04 and the average e(v - r ) for the sgr sample is 0.26 @xmath5 0.04 . using the selective extinction coefficient @xmath34 @xcite ,",
    "the average @xmath7-band extinction is one magnitude .    in order to adopt an accurate reddening estimate ,",
    "first a check on how the reddening differs from rr0 lyrae stars in the bulge and the sgr galaxy is performed .",
    "the color excess , e(v - r ) , along the line of sight to each rr0 lyrae star is calculated using its ( v - r ) color at minimum @xmath7-band light .",
    "the e(v - r ) values of the galactic bulge and sgr rr0 lyrae stars in each macho field are averaged together and the difference in the bulge and sgr color excess is shown in figure  [ plotseven ] .",
    "it is suggestive that 75% of the e(v - r ) values are positive , which means that the stars of the sgr are on average slightly more reddened than the stars in the bulge .",
    "the negative values on the plot are unphysical , as that would mean the sgr stars are closer to us than the bulge . from these negative values , we take the uncertainty in the color excess within each field to be @xmath6 0.015 mags .",
    "the difference in the bulge and sgr color excess as a function of galactic latitude and as a function of galactic longitude were examined .",
    "no trend was found . to determine the extinction in the @xmath7-band ,",
    "the color excess along the line of sight of the bulge and sgr rr0 lyrae stars in each macho field is averaged and multiplied by the selective extinction coefficient .",
    "it is well known that the bulge of the milky way is triaxial . for",
    "a barred distribution with a standard inclination angle , stars at a larger longitudes would be nearer and hence brighter , than those at smaller longitudes .",
    "the macho bulge rr0 lyrae stars span a range of galactic @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and as the distance to sgr is determined in a differential way , comparing the magnitude of rr lyrae stars in sgr and in the bulge , the effect of a triaxial bulge on the macho rr0 lyrae stars is investigated .",
    "figure  [ ploteight ] shows the mean reddening - independent magnitudes in each macho field for the stars used in this analysis .",
    "reddening - independent magnitudes are defined as @xmath36 , where the factor 4.3 is the selective extinction coefficient @xmath37 derived by @xcite .",
    "the errorbar is the dispersion in the mean @xmath38 of the stars in each field .",
    "there is no trend in @xmath39 as a function position , which is what would be expected if the rr0 lyrae stars traced out the barred distribution in the bulge .",
    "this is not surprising ; @xcite find no strong bar signature when restricting the macho rr0 lyrae sample to those stars closest to the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite find a weak barred signature in the ogle bulge rr0 lyrae population and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite also find no strong bar in the rr lyrae distribution .",
    "it is generally assumed that the absence of a strong bar in the bulge rr lyrae suggests that these stars represent a different population than the majority of the more metal - rich stars in the bulge .",
    "translating the heliocentric distance of a star to the galactic center , @xmath40 , involves sin @xmath2 for @xmath0=0@xmath1 , and more complex relations for @xmath41 .",
    "the macho fields are not located directly behind the center of the bulge but at a galactic latitudes as low as @xmath2610@xmath1 , and all the macho fields in this analysis have @xmath420@xmath1 , . in order to determine how substantial an effect this is , we adapt the procedure used by @xcite , who modeled the expected rr lyrae density versus distance in baade s window using : @xmath43^{\\lambda/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 = distance from observer along line of sight ; @xmath40=distance to galactic center ; @xmath44=constant ( kpc@xmath45 ) ; @xmath46=effective angular size of each field , @xmath47=power law exponent ( @xmath480 ) of the number density ; @xmath49=@xmath40-@xmath8cos @xmath2 cos @xmath0 ; @xmath50 = @xmath8 cos @xmath2 sin @xmath0 ; @xmath51 = @xmath8 sin @xmath2 ; and @xmath52=the ellipticity parameter , the ratio of the bulge minor and major axes .    for each field with a unique @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we assume @xmath40 = 8 kpc and vary @xmath8 .",

    "changes the distance from the observer along the line of sight by + 0.15 to 0.25 kpc . from the previous section in which no bar was seen in the rr lyrae sample ,",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath52=0.6 for the rr lyrae population in the bulge .",
    "the correction in the distance due to the fact that the macho fields are not at ( @xmath57 ) = ( 0@xmath31 , 0@xmath31 ) is a relatively small effect ( @xmath6 0.2 kpc ) .",

    "the difference in the average distance modulus of each macho bulge and sgr field is found : @xmath58 in the above equation , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the average macho mean @xmath7-band magnitude of the stars in each bulge and sgr macho field , respectively . @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the average absolute magnitude of the sgr and bulge stars in each macho field , respectively , determined using the stars metallicity and equation  ( 1 ) . @xmath63 and",

    "the error in the derived distance modulus included the error in the photometry , the uncertainty in the ratio of selective to total extinction , and the error in the reddening for both the sgr and bulge stars .",
    "the reliability of this error estimate was confirmed by using the small sample statistical formulae of keeping ( 1962 , p. 202 ) to calculate the standard error of the mean of the distance modulus in each macho field of the sgr and bulge stars .",
    "the differences of each macho fields distance modulus of the bulge and sgr rr0 lyrae stars are shown in figure  [ plotten ] as a function of @xmath66 , an angle in the galactocentric spherical coordinate system .",
    "this is a more natural spherical coordinate system for the interpretation of sgr tidal debris , using the sgr orbital plane traced out by the 2mass m giant population from @xcite .",

    "the distance to m54 , the globular cluster located at the center of sgr , is found using the photometry of rr0 lyraes from @xcite .",
    "the reddening was determined from @xmath67 color at minimum light , just as the reddening in this analysis uses the @xmath32 colors at minimum @xmath7-band light the absolute magnitude of these stars was determined using equation  ( 1 ) in an identical manner as in this analysis .",
    "this places the distance to m54 approximately on the same scale as the sgr rr0 lyraes in this paper .",
    "we experimented with different divisions of the macho sgr and bulge populations , particularly cuts that are within 1.0@xmath28 and 1.5@xmath28 of the mean of each distribution , cuts that include the stars brighter than 19.1 mags , and cuts that encompass the full period range of the bulge rr0 lyrae stars .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes these results .",
    "it is striking that the various cuts do not affect the derived distance ( with a range of @xmath68 = 2.39 to 2.42 ) , indicating that the method does not introduce important biases or selection effects to the sample .",

    "@xcite used 1466 rr0 lyrae stars discovered in a 25 deg@xmath70 field , centered at the galactic coordinates b = -7@xmath1 , l = 3@xmath1 , to derive the distance to sgr as 24 @xmath5 2 kpc .",
    "the location of this field is similar to the location of the macho fields , and the distance determination is in very good agreement with that found in this paper .",
    "other distance estimates are listed in table  [ disttab ] ; direct comparisons are difficult to make since many of the studies differ in significant ways , _",
    "i.e. _ , sgr population , position in the sky . it would be interesting to do similar differential studies using rr lyrae stars that populate other locations in the sgr galaxy .",
    "models of the disruption of sgr based on numerical simulations of the sagittarius plus the milky way are available in the literature .",
    "detailed comparisons are made here between the distances of the macho fields based on the rr lyrae stars and the most recent theoretical models : @xcite and law , johnston & majewski ( 2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ ploteleven ] is a plot of ra against distance for the rr lyraes in the macho survey .",
    "the model of @xcite ( their figure  6 ) fails to reproduce in detail the location of the macho rr lyre stars .",
    "@xcite assumes a distance of 25 kpc for m54 , whereas the distance to m54 determined from rr lyrae stars is 27.3 kpc .",
    "although shifting the distance of the macho rr lyrae stars by a distance of -2.3 kpc places m54 in agreement with the @xcite model , the macho observations with their slightly smaller values of ra than m54 do not overlap at all .",
    "vivas , zinn , & gallart ( 2005 ) find a similar result with quest rr lyrae stars , in that the @xcite model does not reproduce the spread of rr lyrae distances in the particular right ascension of the quest survey ( ra @xmath6 200 - 230@xmath1 ) .",
    "figure  [ plottwelve ] shows the @xmath71 projection of the sgr stream with respect to the galactic center .",
    "here we have adjusted the zero - point of the distance modulus so that m54 corresponds to the same approximate location as @xcite ; consequently , the macho rr lyrae data is also now placed on the same @xcite scale . again",
    "the model fails to reproduce the macho rr lyrae observational data . for the average distance of the sgr orbit ,",
    "their potential flatness was an oblate halo with @xmath72@xmath60.85 .",
    "@xcite use m giants found in the 2mass survey to model the sgr galaxy .",
    "figure  [ plotthirteen ] shows the macho rr lyrae observations in the @xmath73 plane ( see majewski et  al .",
    "2003 for details of the cartesian sgr , gc plane ) , along with the @xcite @xmath74-body tidal debris in the sgr , gc plane for a spherical ( @xmath72=1 ) model of the galactic halo potential .",
    "again the zero - point of the distance modulus is adjusted so that m54 corresponds to the distance used by @xcite .",
    "this time the agreement between the model and the observations agrees nicely .",
    "@xcite find that models that assume spherical and prolate dark matter halos provide better fits to the quest data .",
    "this appears to be the case for the macho data as well .",
    "a differential approach and rr0 lyrae stars from the macho database are used to provide a new estimate of the distance modulus to the sgr galaxy .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the macho bulge fields have rr0 lyrae stars located both in the bulge and the sgr dwarf galaxy , which can be separated by examining their @xmath7 magnitudes . by finding the relative distances between the bulge and sgr in each given macho field ,",
    "systematic effects are largely avoided .",
    "the obtained distance modulus is @xmath69 @xmath18 2.41 at @xmath0 = 5@xmath1 and @xmath2 = -8@xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath4 = 16.97 or d = 24.8 @xmath5 0.8 kpc , for @xmath3 = 8 kpc .",
    "this distance is significantly smaller than the distance derived from the rr lyrae stars located in m54 from @xcite .",
    "this indicates that at distances further from the body of sgr , the sgr galaxy is closer to us .",
    "hence , the extension of the sgr galaxy towards the galactic plane is inclined toward us .",
    "differential studies have the advantage of canceling many systematic effects that occur in data collection , reduction and analysis . given the small error bar in the distance estimate determined here for the sgr galaxy , models that trace out the orbit of sgr and determine its previous history can be more tightly constrained .",
    "our observations are compared to recent models of the destruction of the sgr galaxy .",
    "models that assume an oblate flattening of the dark matter halo provide a poor fit to the data @xcite .",
    "models that assume spherical dark matter halos ( @xmath72 @xmath18 1.0 , as shown in figure  [ plotthirteen ] ) agree better with the macho rr lyrae observations .",
