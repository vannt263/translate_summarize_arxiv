    "this seminal work illustrated that long filamentary features are the natural consequence of the tidal forces experienced during such encounters , at the rate of one tail per prograde disk .",

    "this proposal has been repeatedly confirmed with more sophisticated numerical treatments ( see @xcite , 1996 ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the natural consequence of such encounters , the toomres hypothesized , would be pairs of galaxies spiraling ever closer together , eventually leaving a single stellar body with two protruding tidal tails .",

    "these systems span the entire range of the sequence from beginning to end .",
    "we chose to improve our understanding of the dynamical effects occurring during merging encounters by observing additional systems at the beginning and end of the sequence ( ngc 4676 and ngc 3921 , respectively ) and by re - observing ngc 520 .",

    "the absence of gas in one progenitor also lessens the frequency of gas cloud collisions in the second disk , especially within the central few kpc ( @xcite ) , and therefore less dissipation and angular momentum transport is expected .",
    "the presence of two large , atomic gas - rich tidal tails associated with ngc  4676 suggests that both progenitor disks were gas - rich ( see hvg96 ) , and a different explanation may be needed . as stated earlier , ngc  4676b appears to be an early hubble type spiral and may also have been relatively molecular gas poor initially .",
    "a numerical study by mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) has shown that the presence or absence of a massive bulge in the progenitor disk can produce a large difference in the evolution of the gas distribution and kinematics , the peak gas density achieved , and the resulting star formation activity . the apparent difference between the current molecular gas content in the two merging disks in ngc  4676 may be explained more naturally by differences in the internal structure of the progenitors .",
    "while it is significant that these three optically selected mergers show notable departures from the canonical merger scenario , we should also keep in mind that they nevertheless represent only three individual snapshots of their respective merger evolutions .",
    "for example , the apparent difference in the status of molecular gas between the two merging disks in ngc  4676 may simply reflect a slight delay in the onset of the gas inflow created by the difference in the spin - orbit coupling , however fortuitous this may seem .",
    "similarly , ngc  3921 may be in a brief , early stage in its merger evolution and may soon develop a molecular disk .",
    "schweizer ( 1996 ) has also presented observation evidence that ngc 3921 is a dynamically young merger .",
    "however , central co disks are commonly found in both earlier ( e.g. ngc 520 and ngc 4676a ) and later stage ( e.g. ngc 7252 ) mergers .",
    "one may further postulate that ngc  3921 represents a stage even further in its evolution where the original central gas complex is already dispersed . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed gas in the central region is largely the result of recent inflow from the tidal tails ( see hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .    finally , a clear and significant quantitative result from this imaging study of optically selected merger systems is that their central molecular gas surface density is systematically smaller by orders of magnitude compared with the ir selected mergers ( see table  2 ) .",
    "further , the level of activity associated with each of the merger systems appears to depend strongly on the central gas density .",
    "we will discuss this and other comparisons of global properties between the optically selected and ir selected mergers in a separate paper ( paper ii ) .",
    "position - velocity plot of co emission in ngc  3921 in comparison to the kinematics of the optical emission lines is shown on the right panel while the actual positions of each sampled component are shown on the right panel .",
    "the  kinematics of s96 are indicated by filled circles .",
    "co velocities measured from the first moment map across the peak of the co distribution at a pa of 45@xmath6 are shown as small `` + '' s .",
    "the `` clean components '' associated with the southern clump are denoted by encircled  s \" .",
    "the size of the symbol is proportional to the s / n of the component .",
    "[ fig : n3921lv ]",
    "in an effort to better understand the nature of the luminous infrared galaxy phenomenon and to scrutinize the details of the merger scenario , we have mapped the co emission in an optically selected sample of on - going mergers with moderate ir luminosity (  toomre sequence \" , @xcite ) at a resolution and sensitivity comparable to those of the more ir luminous objects , and the response of the molecular gas material deep inside the potential of the colliding galaxies is traced .",
    "the summary of our findings is as follows :    \\1 .",
    "a compact ( @xmath113 kpc ) molecular complex is found well centered on the inner stellar disk of ngc  4676a , forming a disk- or a ring - like structure with the regular kinematics consistent with simple rotation .",
    "this molecular gas concentration contributes a significant fraction ( 20% ) of the total mass in the nuclear region .",
    "the co emission occurs along the 7 kpc stellar bar in ngc  4676b .",
    "the surface brightness of the co emission is extremely low , and tapering the data from 3@xmath13 to 5@xmath13 resolution nearly doubles the detected flux .",
    "nearly all of the co emission detected at the primary nucleus position in ngc  520 is concentrated in a 1 kpc diameter ring - like structure , coincident with the extended radio continuum source mapped by condon et al .",
    "the derived h@xmath82 mass and the dynamical mass are comparable , and the gas mass must constitute a large fraction of the total mass in the nuclear starburst region . no co emission is detected on the second nucleus in ngc  520 .",
    "the molecular gas distribution in ngc  3921 is quite different from any other singly nucleated merger mapped in co. the co emission is significantly displaced from the peak of the optical , near - infrared , and radio continuum emission ( @xmath114 pc ) , and both the distribution and kinematics suggest that the molecular gas has not settled into the new remnant potential .",
    "the molecular gas complex contributes a minor fraction ( @xmath115% ) of the dynamical mass in the inner regions .",
    "a consistent trend of anti - correlation is seen between co and h@xmath1 emission in ngc  520 and ngc  4676a , and the large extinction inferred from the co emission ( @xmath116 600 & 120 ) suggests that the intense nuclear starburst regions in these galaxies are completely obscured .",
    "this finding offers a natural explanation for the severe under - estimation of the star formation rate by optical tracers compared with the ir ( e.g. @xcite , kennicutt 1989,1998 ) .",
    "departures from the canonical scenario for a merger involving two large spiral galaxies are found in all three toomre sequence mergers studied .",
    "a relatively gas - poor progenitor , as inferred from the optical and  observations by hvg96 , offers a possible explanation for ngc  520 and ngc  3921 .",
    "a gas - poor progenitor disk or rapid evolution in gas content by some dynamical process ( i.e. @xcite ) may offer a plausible explanation for the low molecular gas density in ngc  4676b .",
    "the central molecular gas density in these optically selected mergers is systematically smaller by an order of magnitude compared with the ir selected mergers , the level of activity associated with each of the merger systems appears to depend strongly on the central gas density .",
    "this and other detailed comparisons of global properties between the optically and ir selected mergers will be presented in paper  ii .",
