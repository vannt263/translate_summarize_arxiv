    "a charged @xmath7 bose liquid of small bipolarons as a microscopic model of the ground state of cuprates @xcite explains the high value of @xmath8 and its ` boomerang ' doping dependence @xcite , the divergent upper critical field @xcite , the normal state in - plane and ` c'-axis transport , the magnetic susceptibility and the pseudogap@xcite .",
    "the ( bi)polaronic nature of carriers in these materials is supported by observations of the characteristic polaronic spectral function in the infrared spectra @xcite , of the isotope effect on the carrier mass@xcite , of flat bands in the high - resolution photoemission spectra@xcite , and by a few other experiments such as the pair - distribution analysis of neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the bipolaron model overcomes a fundamental problem with any theory of high-@xmath8 which is the short - range coulomb repulsion . as stressed by emery @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite the theories involving real - space pairs with a pure electronic ( exchange ) mechanism of pairing",
    "are @xmath11 @xmath12 implausible due to the strong short - range coulomb repulsion between two carriers .",
    "the direct repulsion is usually much stronger than any exchange interaction .",
    "the attractive potential generated by the electron - phonon interaction of the holstein model may overcome the short - range coulomb repulsion , but inevitably involves a huge carrier mass enhancement ( otherwise the phonon frequency would be extremely high ) .",
    "on the other hand , one of us showed @xcite that the frhlich electron - phonon interaction can provide @xmath13 mobile intersite small bipolarons which are condensed at high @xmath8 ( of the order of @xmath14 ) .",
    "this interaction , operating on a scale of the order of @xmath15 , compensates the coulomb repulsion and allows the deformation potential ( together with an exchange interaction of any origin ) to bind two holes into an intersite mobile bipolaron in the @xmath16 plane .",
    "the mass renormalisation appears to be smaller by several orders of magnitude than in the holstein model ( with the same attractive potential ) .",
    "hence the charge @xmath7 bose liquid , being already an important reference system of quantum statistics , is now of particular physical interest . because doped mott insulators are disordered , the localisation of carriers by a random potential plays an important role in their low - temperature thermodynamics and transport @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the thermodynamics of charged bosons in the superfluid phase assuming that some of them are localised by disorder .",
    "the fact that in the superconducting phase the chemical potential @xmath17 is pinned at the mobility edge , @xmath18 , significantly simplifies the problem . by using a plausible form of the single well partition function and a model density of localised states , we find the temperature dependence of the specific heat . under certain conditions",
    "the predicted specific heat follows precisely the sub - linear temperature dependence observed@xcite in @xmath5 at low temperatures .",
    "the picture of interacting bosons with a short - range interaction filling up all the localised single - particle states in a random potential is known in the literature @xcite . to calculate the partition function of localised bosons one has to take into account the repulsion between them .",
    "one can not ignore the fact that the localisation length @xmath19 generally varies with energy and diverges at the mobility edge .",
    "one would expect that the number of @xmath20 @xmath21 bosons in a localised state near the mobility edge diverges in a similar way to the localisation length .",
    "only a repulsive interaction can stop all particles condensing into the lowest localised state .",
    "thus , as stressed by fisher @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite , for a bose gas ( in a random field ) there is no sensible non - interacting starting point about which to perturb ; this is in contrast to the case of a fermi gas .",
    "although the comprehensive scaling analysis of neutral @xcite and charged bosons @xcite allows us to describe the quantum bose glass - superfluid transition , the shape of the scaling functions as well as the thermodynamics of each phase away from the transition remain unknown",
    ". a physically plausible model of neutral @xcite and charged bosons @xcite in a random potential based on a separation of localised single - particle states from delocalised states might be helpful . as discussed in ref.@xcite , such separation , strictly speaking ,",
    "is not possible as the localised states will be subsumed into the collective mode .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of this mode can be understood by analysing the high density limit where the dimensionless coulomb repulsion is small : @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the boson mass , @xmath24 is the density and @xmath25 the static dielectric constant of the host material ( and we take @xmath26 ) . in this limit",
    "the excitation spectrum at @xmath27 was calculated by foldy @xcite , who worked at zero temperature using the bogoliubov @xcite approach .",
    "the bogoliubov method leads to the result that the elementary excitations of the system have , for small momenta , energies characteristic of plasma oscillations which pass over smoothly for large momenta to the energies characteristic of single particle excitations .",
    "they screen an external charge with a screening radius , which is temperature independent at low temperatures @xcite . at high density ,",
    "@xmath28 , one can expect a disappearence of localised states because of the screening similar to the mott metal - insulator transition in doped semiconductors .",
    "it is more likely , however , that the dimensionless strength of the coulomb repulsion is about unity or larger , @xmath29 , and it is only when @xmath30 is very large @xmath31 that the wigner crystallisation of charged carriers occurs .",
    "hence , there is a wide interval of densities where the localised states coexist with a superfluid .",
    "being screened they depend on the interaction and the superfluid density .",
    "nevertheless , based on the screening in the high density limit @xcite we expect that the density of localised states @xmath32 near the mobility edge , @xmath33 remains temperature independent at low temperatures ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "if this is so , then the renormalisation of the effective single - particle energies by the collective mode does not affect the temperature dependence of any of the thermodynamic functions at low temperatures .",
    "with all these reservations we assume that at some finite temperature @xmath8 , bosons are condensed at @xmath35 so that the chemical potential @xmath18 .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the delocalised superfluid has a gap of the order of the plasma frequency @xcite and so the bogoliubov collective modes can be ignored in the thermodynamics of the system ( in @xmath36 their contribution is exponentially small while in @xmath37 their energy scales as @xmath38 and the specific heat as @xmath39 ) .",
    "even in the case of a short range repulsion the sound modes yield an energy proportional to @xmath40 and hence a specific heat which behaves like @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath43 , the contribution to thermodynamics from the delocalised bosons appears to be negligible at low temperatures compared with that from bosons localised in shallow potential wells .",
    "hence in the following we calculate the partition function and specific heat of localised bosons only .    for simplicity ,",
    "we choose @xmath44 when two or more charged bosons are in a single localised state of energy @xmath45 there may be significant coulomb energy and we try to take this into account as follows . the localisation length @xmath19 is thought to depend on @xmath45 via @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the coulomb potential energy of @xmath48 charged bosons confined within a radius @xmath19 can be expected to be @xmath49 thus the total energy of @xmath48 bosons in a localised state of energy @xmath45 is taken to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "hence we see that the behaviour of charged bosons in localised states can be thought of as intermediate between bose - einstein statistics and fermi - dirac statistics . when @xmath52 we have an equally spaced set of levels , i.e. bose - einstein behaviour , whereas when @xmath53 we have fermi - dirac behaviour since the only levels with finite energy are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , thus enforcing an exclusion principle . when @xmath56 we have the intermediate ` parastatistics ' that the level spacing @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "we take the total energy of charged bosons in localised states to be the sum of the energies of the bosons in the individual potential wells .",
    "the partition function @xmath59 for such a system is then the product of the partition functions for each of the wells , and the system free energy @xmath60 is simply the sum of the individual free energies @xmath61 .",
    "the free energy of the localised bosons in one unit cell is then given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the one - particle density of localised states per unit cell below the mobility edge .",
    "in this paper we assume the following physically plausible density of localised states @xmath63 : @xmath64 we shall see below that , in the most interesting case , if the width of the tail @xmath65 is large compared with @xmath66 , the specific heat is insensitive to the details of the shape of @xmath67 , depending only on the value of @xmath68 .",
    "before considering the thermodynamics of charged bosons in our assumed density of localised states , we first summarise here the results we have previously obtained@xcite for the thermodynamics of a single potential well with only one single particle level of energy @xmath69 , i.e. for the case @xmath70 the probability for this state to be occupied by @xmath48 bosons is proportional to @xmath71 where @xmath17 is the chemical potential and @xmath72 .",
    "we can re - express @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 fig 1 shows a graph of @xmath73 as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "the partition function @xmath76 for such a single localised state is @xmath77 the partition function is thus completely determined by the dimensionless parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 $ ] .    the corresponding mean occupancy @xmath80 given by @xmath81 and specific heat capacity @xmath82 given by @xmath83 are shown in figs  2 and  3 for the case @xmath84 .",
    "these results were calculated by simply truncating the partition function series at 100 terms .",
    "we now attempt to understand these results in more detail , looking separately at each temperature range .    1 .",
    "@xmath85 + at low temperatures the partition function is dominated by the term with @xmath48 closest to @xmath78 , i.e. the value of @xmath48 giving the lowest value of @xmath73 , and so the mean occupancy @xmath86 is an integer and goes up in steps as @xmath78 increases , as seen in fig  2 .",
    "the changeover in dominance from one term to another occurs when @xmath78 is a half - integer , at which point the two lowest energy states are degenerate .",
    "+ so long as one term dominates the partition function , the specific heat @xmath82 will be close to zero .",
    "however when @xmath78 is close to a half - integer we have a two level system and a corresponding schottky anomaly in the specific heat capacity .",
    "hence , at fixed temperature , the low temperature specific heat capacity ( i.e. @xmath87 ) is periodic in @xmath78 .",
    "2 .   @xmath88 + we can approximate the sum by an integral @xmath89 * @xmath90 + in this case we can approximate the lower limit of the integral as  @xmath91 , i.e. the partition function can be approximated by an untruncated gaussian , and is therefore approximately symmetrical about @xmath78 .",
    "hence , in this temperature range we have @xmath92 as is clearly seen in fig  2 , and @xmath93 as seen in fig  3 . * @xmath88 and @xmath94 + in this case we can approximate the partition function as being an integral over half a gaussian .",
    "we then obtain @xmath95 and the specific heat is again given by @xmath96 ; both of these results are seen in figs  2 and  3 .",
    "having established the partition function @xmath97 for a single potential well containing one single particle level of energy @xmath45 we now use equations  [ eq : f ] and  [ eq : rho ] to derive the thermodynamics of localised bosons .",
    "the average number @xmath98 of bosons in localised states in each unit cell is @xmath99 @xmath80 can be approximated as @xmath100 hence a reasonable approximation for @xmath80 at all temperatures is @xmath101 with this approximation we obtain @xmath102 hence if @xmath103 then @xmath98 becomes infinite and so the formation of a superfluid is excluded .",
    "we have shown above that the contribution to the specific heat @xmath82 from a single localised state is determined solely by the values of two dimensionless quantities : @xmath104 and @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath1 is temperature independent , @xmath82 can instead be considered as a function of a different pair of quantities : @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 the integrated specific heat c of the localised bosons is then @xmath108      in this case @xmath110 and is therefore temperature independent .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath111 if @xmath67 is constant in the region @xmath112 then equation  [ eq : nu=1 ] yields @xmath113 ; for @xmath114 given by equation  [ eq : rho ] this result applies if @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath3 the integral in equation  [ eq : c ] can be thought of as an integral over three regions :    1 .",
    "@xmath106<\\tau^{-1/\\nu}$ ]  \\{i.e .",
    "@xmath116  } + in this region @xmath117 and so @xmath118 2 .",
    "@xmath119<\\tau^{-1/(\\nu-1)}$ ] + \\{i.e .",
    "@xmath120  } + this region only exists if @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath82 is dominated by schottky anomalies , each centred on a half - integer value of @xmath104 .",
    "the last full schottky anomaly in the series is at @xmath122 , so the total number @xmath123 of schottky anomalies is @xmath124 if we ignore all except the lowest two energy levels then for each anomaly @xmath125 3 .",
    "@xmath106>\\tau^{-1/(\\nu-1)}$ ]  \\{i.e .",
    "@xmath126  } + here the @xmath55 level is the lowest energy level , and the @xmath54 level is the next lowest .",
    "if higher levels are neglected then @xmath82 is solely a function of @xmath106 $ ] and is non - negligible only for @xmath127<10 $ ] .",
    "hence this region can be neglected entirely if @xmath128 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath129 the integrated specific heat for this region will be that of half a schottky anomaly : @xmath130    if @xmath131 then @xmath132 throughout regions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath133 then @xmath132 throughout region ( 3 ) .",
    "we take both of these conditions to hold so that equation  [ eq : c ] can be re - written as @xmath134 i.e. if @xmath1 is fixed then @xmath135 is solely a function of @xmath136 .    hence we can distinguish two cases for which an approximate analytical formula for @xmath0 can be derived :    1 .",
    "@xmath128 + in this case region ( 3 ) can be neglected . from equations",
    "[ eq : c1 ] , [ eq : s ] and  [ eq : c2 ] we then obtain @xmath137                       \\frac{n_lk_b^2}{\\tau^{1/\\nu}\\gamma }          \\label{eq : c / t1}\\ ] ] this implies @xmath138 i.e. the specific heat has a power law dependence on temperature in which the power is less than unity .",
    "2 .   @xmath129 + in this case the specific heat @xmath0 is dominated by region ( 3 ) . from equation  [ eq : c3 ]",
    "we then obtain @xmath139 i.e. @xmath135 is temperature independent .",
    "4 compares these two formulae ( for the case @xmath140 ) with the result of calculating @xmath0 from equation  [ eq : c / t ] by numerical integration ( in which @xmath82 is calculated from the first 100 terms of the partition function ) .",
    "now @xmath104 increases as @xmath142 increases .",
    "again we can distinguish three regions    1 .",
    "@xmath106<\\tau^{-1/\\nu}$ ]  \\{i.e .",
    "@xmath143  } + here @xmath117 and so once again @xmath96 .",
    "2 .   @xmath119<\\tau^{1/(1-\\nu)}$ ] +  \\{i.e . @xmath144  } + here the partition function is dominated by the two levels corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath54 . if @xmath121 this region does not exist .",
    "3 .   @xmath106>\\tau^{1/(1-\\nu)}$ ]  \\{i.e . @xmath126  } + here @xmath82 is dominated by an infinite series of schottky anomalies centred on values of @xmath45 corresponding to half - integer values of @xmath78 : @xmath145^\\frac{1}{1-\\nu}\\ ] ]    we consider the low temperature limit , i.e. @xmath146 ( for @xmath141 ) .",
    "let @xmath147 equation  [ eq : c ] becomes @xmath148 in the low temperature limit @xmath149 , region  1 makes a negligible contribution to the integral in equation  [ eq : cchi ]",
    ". provided @xmath150 we can make the approximation that , when integrating through each schottky anomaly , @xmath151 can be taken to be a constant depending on the anomaly ; hence the contribution from each anomaly is proportional to the result given in equation  [ eq : c2 ] ( and equation  [ eq : c3 ] ) .",
    "thus , in the low temperature limit , we have @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath152 then many schottky anomalies contribute significantly to the integral in equation  [ eq : cchi ] .",
    "in that case we can neglect region  2 and transform the sum over schottky anomalies into an integral with respect to @xmath78 , obtaining :    @xmath153    in the high temperature limit , on the other hand , we have @xmath154 and @xmath155 ; in that case only region  1 is significant and we obtain : @xmath156",
    "we have used a reasonable scaling of coulomb energy with localisation length to calculate the low temperature dependence of the specific heat of a charged superfluid in a random potential .",
    "the result strongly depends on the exponent @xmath1 of the localisation length .",
    "while the specific heat is linear for @xmath157 , it is proportional to @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",
    "we believe that our findings are relevent for those doped high-@xmath8 cuprates having many properties of a charged bose - liquid@xcite . because of the high level of doping of these mott - hubbard insulators in the superconducting region one can expect a continuous density of states @xmath63 similar to that studied by us",
    "; our prediction about the power law dependence of @xmath0 ( for @xmath3 ) requires , of the density of states , only that @xmath160 .",
    "superconducting @xmath5 has been observed@xcite to have a low temperature specific heat proportional to @xmath161 with @xmath162 being in the range @xmath163 dependent on doping .",
    "this fits with our prediction for charged bosons partly localised by disorder at low temperature and @xmath3 .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath164 could be due to a gradual change of the localisation length exponent @xmath1 caused by a difference in the random potential profiles for different @xmath165 .",
    "values of @xmath162 as low as 0.33 are observed  @xcite experimentally while our model excludes the possibility of superconductivity for @xmath166 .",
    "however we believe that the approximation for coulomb potential energy in equations  [ eq : pe]-[eq : w ] is likely to be inadequate at large  @xmath1 .",
