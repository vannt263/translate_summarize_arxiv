    "quantum mechanics plays a daily role in our lives . everything that works - from the television screen to our brain - draws upon the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "little wonder therefore that quantum mechanics can play a central role in fashioning computing machinery .",
    "the idea of using quantum mechanics to build `` quantum computers '' that outpace `` classical computers '' is not all that new .",
    "the ideas have been around for more than 25 years .",
    "it is only recently that this field has received widespread attention as a result perhaps of rapid advances in device and materials technology , particularly nanotechnology .",
    "it is not all that difficult anymore to construct solid state devices where the quantum mechanical wave nature of electrons is manifested at a relatively balmy temperature of 77 k , the temperature of liquid nitrogen .",
    "it therefore behooves the device physics community to seriously ponder the art and science of quantum informatics .    what then is quantum informatics ?",
    "examples are always better than precepts and therefore it is easiest to grasp the nature of quantum computing by looking at some examples .    in classical digital computing ( analog computing is another matter ; it is not much used anyway ) , one is accustomed to the idea of representing numbers with binary bits and then manipulating the bits according to a given set of instructions ( the program ) to carry out a computation . a binary bit is the most primitive carrier of information .",
    "it can have two values : 0 or 1 .",
    "the information content of the bit is its value .    in the 1930s",
    ", there was an ongoing effort to identify a _",
    "mathematical _ model of the computing process which will be independent of how the computer ( hardware and software ) is implemented .",
    "alan turing , alsonso church , kurt gdel and emil post , independently developed mathematical models of computation that were independent of any assumptions regarding how the computer is built .",
    "gdel identified algorithmic ( computation ) processes with general recursive functions ( functions that call themselves ) .",
    "church identified them with the so - called the @xmath0-definable functions @xcite .",
    "turing , on the other hand , provided a very physical picture .",
    "he visualized the computing process as the actions of a so - called universal turing machine .",
    "it consists of an infinite tape and a head .",
    "the tape has an infinite sequence of bits .",
    "the head can reset any bit to 0 or 1 , reset its own internal memory , and then jump one bit to the left or right , or simply stay where it is .",
    "this machine can execute any classical algorithm and therefore model any classical computer @xcite .",
    "it has now been shown that gdel s , church s and turing s models are all equivalent .",
    "roman maeder @xcite has written a simulator showing how the computation of any recursive function , that calls itself , can be simulated in a deterministic turing machine , thereby unifying gdel s model directly with turing s .",
    "there are two classes of turing machines : deterministic and probablistic .",
    "we will discuss them briefly .",
    "the deterministic turing machine consists of an infinitely long tape partitioned into cells , each containing a 0 , or a 1 .",
    "there is a read / write head that can move left or right by one cell at a time .",
    "the head can exist is one of a finite set of memory states and contains a set of instructions ( a program ) that specify , depending on the current internal state and the bit currently being read by the head , how the internal state of the head will change , whether the bit being scanned will be changed and in which direction the head will move , if it moves at all .    the so - called church - turing thesis states that any computation can be modeled by the universal turing machine .",
    "this thesis is the cornerstone of computer science and its implication is profound .",
    "this means that expensive supercomputers with several parallel processors and inexpensive personal computers , are , in a sense , equally powerful .",
    "they are both described by the universal turing machine .",
    "given enough memory and time , the personal computers can do anything that supercomputers can .      while the head of a deterministic turing machine , in a given state , reading a certain bit on the tape , has only one ( unique ) successor state available to it",
    ", a probabilistic turing machine has multiple successor states available . which state is ultimately acquired depends on a random choice .",
    "it is obvious then , that the probabilistic machine does not produce the correct answer with absolute certainty . if one requires a correct answer with absolute certainty , then there is an uncertainty in the length of time the probabilistic turing machine must run . in fact , there is a trade - off between the time it takes to produce an answer and the probability that the answer is correct .",
    "curiously , many problems can be solved more efficiently on a probablistic turing machine than on a deterministic turing machine using the so - called random algorithms .",
    "it has been shown that anything computable by a probabilistic turing machine is computable by a deterministic turing machine and vice versa , although the probabilistic machine may be more efficient in some cases @xcite .",
    "despite the immense success of the universal turing machine in modeling computation , it has one serious shortcoming .",
    "it is really not completely universal since it is now understood that it is not completely independent of the physical model of the computer . perhaps unknowingly , turing based his machine on the models of the classical world .",
    "the turing machine is unable to capture the subtleties of the quantum mechanical world and computation processes based on quantum mechanics .",
    "there is now a model of _ quantum turing machines_. it has a long history and started with charles bennet first showing that there exists a _",
    "reversible turing machine _ such that if the state of the machine is known at any time , it is possible to predict the states at all future times and all past times .",
    "there is no dissipation and loss of information in this machine @xcite .",
    "bennet s reversible turing machine was completely classical , but it portended a quantum mechanical sister since the dynamical evolution of an isolated quantum system is also completely reversible in time . in 1980 , paul benioff devised a quantum system whose actions mimicked that of a classical reversible turing machine @xcite .",
    "benioff s machine was not a true quantum turing machine however , since although in between computation steps the machine existed in a quantum mechanical state , it reverted to a classical state at the conclusion of each computation step .",
    "thus , this machine was no more powerful that bennel s classical reversible turing machine .    in 1982 ,",
    "richard feynman showed that no classical turing machine could simulate quantum phenomena without an exponential penalty in processing time @xcite .",
    "finally , in 1985 , david deutsch devised the first true quantum turing machine .",
    "its read , write and move operations were executed via quantum mechanical interactions .",
    "more importantly , whereas a classical turing machine ( including the reversible one ) could encode only a 0 or a 1 in each cell of the tape , the quantum machine could encode a _ superposition _ of 0 and 1 simultaneously in each cell .",
    "thus , the quantum machine could encode many inputs simultaneously on the same tape and perform a calculation on all of them in one step , completing the calculation in the time it takes for a classical machine to do the calculation on only one of the inputs .",
    "this immense speed up is called _",
    "quantum parallelism_. more on it later .",
    "to understand quantum parallelism , and indeed to understand the nuances of quantum computing , one must first understand the concept of quantum bits ( or `` qubits '' ) .",
    "quantum computing does not process classical bits .",
    "instead , it processes quantum bits ( or `` qubits '' ) which are neither 0 or 1 , but a coherent superposition of both 0 and 1 .",
    "this means that the bit is neither 0 , nor 1 , which does not make sense classically , but makes perfect sense quantum mechanically .",
    "the qubit can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the state in which the qubit has a value of 0 and @xmath3 denotes the state in which the qubit has a value of 1 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 are complex quantities whose squared magnitudes denote the probability that if a measurement is performed on the qubit , it will be found to have a value of 0 and 1 respectively .",
    "note that although a qubit can exist in suspended animation  between a 0 and a 1",
    " it must ultimately succumb to the fate of having a definite classical value ( 0 or 1 ) when it is `` measured '' .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is unambiguous .",
    "however , prior to the measurement , the qubit is neither 0 , nor 1 .",
    "it is in a so - called coherent superposition state , and the measurement can yield a value of either 0 or 1 .",
    "all we can say is that the probabilities of getting those two values are respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "note also that since the measurement can yield a value of only 0 or 1 , and nothing else , it follows that @xmath8 we emphasize that equation ( 1 ) _ does not _ imply that the qubit is sometimes in state @xmath2 with probability @xmath6 , and the rest of the time in state @xmath3 with probability @xmath7 .",
    "it is only after measurement that the qubit collapses to a classical bit and assumes a definite value of 0 or 1 .",
    "prior to the measurement , it _ does not _ have a definite value ; it is both 0 and 1 , _ all the time_. it is therefore called a superposition state .    while one can easily understand the meaning of `` superposition '' from the foregoing discussion , to understand the implication of a `` coherent '' superposition requires a little more reflection .",
    "coherence has to do with the phases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( being complex quantities , they have an amplitude and a phase ) .",
    "it might appear that the phase is never relevant since these coefficients seemingly determine only the probabilities which , in turn , depend only on the squared magnitudes .",
    "this is actually not true .",
    "consider a hypothetical bit - flip operator @xmath9 whose action is to flip a bit from 0 to 1 and vice versa ( a classical realization of a bit flip operator is an inverter or not gate ) .",
    "its action on a bit can be represented as @xmath10 note from the above that @xmath11 and @xmath3 are not eigenstates of the operator .",
    "if we want to calculate the expected value of this operator for a system described by a qubit , we will get ( following the usual prescription of quantum mechanics ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the phase angle difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in deriving the last equation , we used equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) and also the fact that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are orthonormal states by themselves . the fact that @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are orthogonal to each other is obvious because any measurement outcome can produce either a 0 or a 1 , and absolutely nothing in between .",
    "thus the two possible outcomes are mutually exclusive , meaning that the two states are orthogonal to each other .    equation ( 4 ) clearly shows that there are quantities that depend on the phases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . thus maintaining the correct phase relations between these quantities , or `` coherence '' is important .",
    "quantum computation depends critically on this coherence .    before ending this section",
    ", we point out that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are continuous ( analog ) variables whose magnitudes can take any value between 0 and 1 and whose phases can also take any value between 0 and 2@xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to digital binary bits .",
    "thus , quantum computation is neither quite analog computing , nor digital , but something in between .",
    "we are now ready to provide the first glimpse of the power of quantum computing .",
    "consider a bistable atom .",
    "we can use the excited state to encode the binary bit 1 and the ground state to encode the binary bit 0 .",
    "classically , this atom can store only one bit of information ( whose value can be 0 or 1 ) because we have two degrees of freedom ( ground and excited ) and two possible values of the binary bit .",
    "since each atom can store only one bit , @xmath15 bistable atoms can store @xmath15 binary bits classically .",
    "but now , if we can create a coherent superposition of the states of two atoms , the corresponding qubit will be written as @xmath16 where the state @xmath17 corresponds to the first atom being in state @xmath18 and the second atom in state @xmath19 .",
    "this system can , in principle , store 2@xmath20 bits of information corresponding to ( i ) both atoms being in the ground state , ( ii ) first in ground state and second in excited , ( iii ) first in excited and second in ground , and ( iv ) both excited .",
    "note that the classical case would correspond to only one of the coefficients in equation ( [ qubit ] ) being non - zero . extending this to @xmath15 bistable atoms ,",
    "we can write the corresponding qubit as @xmath21 where the @xmath22 s can take the value 0 or 1 . the above equation has 2@xmath23 terms .",
    "it means that while @xmath15 bistable atoms can store @xmath15 binary bits classically , the same system can store 2@xmath23 classical bits quantum mechanically .",
    "here is the clincher .",
    "if we want to store 2@xmath24 binary bits of information , it is impossible in the classical realm since the number 2@xmath24 is larger than the number of atoms in the known universe .",
    "however , in the quantum mechanical realm , just 1000 bistable atoms in a coherent superposition state can do the job .",
    "these 1000 atoms could store more information than all the hards disks in the universe made over the life of the universe !",
    "now the tempered vision .",
    "one might be tempted to think that we can make a huge `` memory '' storing 2@xmath23 binary bits of information using just @xmath15 bistable atoms .",
    "this point of view would be _",
    "a true memory should be such that every time it is accessed , it returns the _ same _ data which is stored in it .",
    "for instance , if we have stored the binary string 11001 , we should get this string _ every time _ the memory is read .",
    "but the quantum memory we are talking about does not satisfy this requirement .",
    "every time we read the memory , the qubits collapse to classical bits and we only get @xmath15 ( not 2@xmath23 ) bits out of it .",
    "more importantly , the values of these bits change with each measurement because of the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement .",
    "it is never the same bit string in two successive measurements ! surely , this can not be judged a reliable memory .",
    "there is a subtle difference between _ memory _ and _ storage_. memory implies accessibility and fidelity , storage does not .",
    "we may store 2@xmath23 bits of information , but not be able to access them .",
    "however , the ability of the quantum system to co - exist in 2@xmath23 states is what is important .",
    "it forms the basis of an attribute known as quantum parallelism .",
    "in the world of classical computers , parallelism refers to parallel ( simultaneous ) processing of different information in different processors .",
    "quantum parallelism refers to simultaneous processing of different information or inputs in the _ same _ processor .",
    "this idea , due to deutsch , refers to the notion of evaluating a function once on a superposition of all possible inputs to the function to produce a superposition of outputs .",
    "thus , all outputs are produced in the time taken to calculate one output classically .",
    "of course , not all of these outputs are accessible since a measurement on the superposition state of the output will produce only one output . however , it is possible to obtain certain joint properties @xcite of the outputs , and that is a remarkable possibility .",
    "let us exemplify quantum parallelism more concretely .",
    "consider the situation when @xmath15 inputs @xmath25 , @xmath26 , ... @xmath27 are provided to a computer and their functions @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 , ... @xmath30 are to be computed .",
    "the results are then fed to another computer to calculate the functional @xmath31 .    with a classical computer",
    ", we will calculate @xmath28 , @xmath29 , ... @xmath30 serially , one after the other . with a quantum computer , the story is different .    prepare the initial state as a superposition of the inputs .",
    "@xmath32 let it evolve in time to produce the output @xmath33 note that @xmath34 has been obtained in the time required to perform a single computation . now ,",
    "if @xmath35 = @xmath31 , can be computed from @xmath34 , then a quantum computer will be of great advantage .",
    "this is an example where `` quantum parallelism '' can be used to speed up the computation tremendously .",
    "there are two questions now .",
    "can @xmath35 be computed from a knowledge of the superposition of various @xmath36 and not the individual @xmath36s ?",
    "the answer is `` yes '' , but for a small class of problems .",
    "these are called the deutsch - josza class of problems which can benefit from quantum parallelism .",
    "second , can @xmath35 be computed correctly with unit probability .",
    "the answer is `` no '' .",
    "@xmath35 can not be computed with unit probability . however , if the first answer is wrong ( hopefully , the computing entity can differentiate right from wrong answers ) , then the experiment or computation is repeated until the right answer is obtained .",
    "the probability of getting the right answer within @xmath37 iterations is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the probability of getting the wrong answer in any iteration .",
    "the mean number of times the experiment should be repeated is @xmath40 .",
    "the following is an example of deutsch - josza class of problems .",
    "for integer @xmath41 , given that the function @xmath42 @xmath43 [ 0,1 ] has one of two properties ",
    "( i ) either @xmath42 is independent of @xmath22 , or ( ii ) one half of the numbers @xmath44 are zero  determine which type the function belongs to using the fewest computational steps .",
    "the most efficient classical computer will require @xmath45 evaluations , whereas according to deutsch and josza , a quantum computer can solve this problem with just two iterations .",
    "in computer science , complexity refers to how efficiently a problem can be solved .",
    "a measure of the efficiency is the rate of growth of the time or memory required to solve a problem as the size of the problem increases .",
    "complexity measures are independent of the make and prowess of the computer , but depend on the mathematical model of the computer , such as whether it is a deterministic classical turing machine , a probabilistic classical turing machine , or a quantum machine . in fact , many problems that are deemed intractable on a deterministic classical turing machine can be solved very efficiently with high probability of success on a probabilistic classical turing machine . in classical complexity theory , there are 5 classes of problems @xcite .",
    "they are shown in table 1 .",
    "the study of quantum complexity classes begun with deutsch @xcite .",
    "since the quantum turing machine is a quantum mechanical refinement of probabilistic turing machines , the quantum complexity classes are close cousins of the probabilistic complexity classes .",
    "there are three known quantum complexity classes @xcite which are shown in table 2 .",
    ".classical complexity classes [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     when bob receives the bits , he measures them also in either the rectilinear or the diagonal basis randomly .",
    "for those bits where he and alice coincidentally used the same bases , there should be perfect correlation .",
    "if alice sent out a bit 1 in rectilinear basis , meaning a polarization angle of 90@xmath46 ( see above table ) , and bob also happens to measure it in the rectilinear basis , then he should measure an angle of 90@xmath46 and interpret the bit as 1 .",
    "alice and bob then announce over a public ( insecure ) channel what bases they used for each bit measurement .",
    "they then discard those bits where they happened to have used _",
    "different _ bases . in the case of the remaining bits , where they accidentally used the _ same _ bases ,",
    "alice can predict perfectly what bit value bob should have measured each time .",
    "she sent those bits out and bob s measurement scheme was correct by happenstance ; so there should be perfect agreement .",
    "similarly bob can predict what bits alice sent out , because he measured them and he knows that he measured them correctly .",
    "the only exception to this happens if an eavesdropper ( named eve ) is lurking in the channel and disturbed the polarizations in her attempt to eavesdrop on the bits alice was sending out .",
    "we will show in the next section that quantum mechanics ( or more precisely the heisenberg uncertainty principle and the no cloning theorem ) guarantees that this disturbance must take place whenever eve intercepts a photon .",
    "alice now announces over a public channel _ some _ of the bits she sent out and asks bob to check if he received those particular bits intact .",
    "if he did , then there is likely to be no eavesdropper and the channel is secure .",
    "any disagreement between the values of the bits alice sent out and bob measured correctly ( with the same basis ) reveals the presence of an eavesdropper who caused a disturbance . in the quantum world , eve can not hide since she can not avoid causing a disturbance whenever she tries to eavesdrop on the bits .    here",
    "is why eve causes a disturbance . in her attempt to eavesdrop",
    ", she must intercept the bits from alice before they reach bob and measure the polarizations to decipher the bits . since she does not know what bases alice used to encode the bits , she measures them in random bases .",
    "let us consider the situation when alice sent out a bit with value 1 in the rectilinear basis and eve measured it in the diagonal basis . because of the uncertainty relationship between the rectilinear and diagonal bases , eve can not tell whether the bit was 0 or 1 . in her attempt to hide , she must send a photon out to bob pretending to be alice .",
    "one half of the time she will send out the incorrect bit 0 in the rectilinear basis ( this is also the no - cloning theorem ; she can never clone the photon s polarization - a quantum entity - with 100% fidelity ) .",
    "let us say now that bob measures this in the rectilinear basis and measures a 0 because that is what he received from eve .",
    "later , when bob and alice compare notes over this bit , they will realize that alice sent a bit with value 1 but bob received a 0 .",
    "therefore , this disagreement reveals the presence of eve .    of course , just a few disagreements do not reveal the presence of eve since they could be due to imperfections in the channel or other errors that cause bit flips .",
    "however , consistent disagreements in several bits reveal the presence of eve .",
    "in fact , the probability of detecting eve goes as 1 - ( 3/4)@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of bits tested .",
    "thus , eve can be detected with near unit probability by testing a large number of bits .",
    "once eve is detected , alice and bob stop communicating and try again later .",
    "this goes on till eve gets bored and leaves .",
    "in this section , we showed that quantum mechanics guarantees secure cryptography . in 1989 , ibm built a quantum cryptography machine @xcite .",
    "today , there is a 30 km long quantum cryptography line operating under lake geneva in switzerland @xcite .",
    "anybody familiar with the popular sci - fi series star trek knowns what teleportation is supposed to do .",
    "it takes an object ( a human or a klingon in star trek ) , destroys it at the source , and recreates it _ exactly _ at the destination .",
    "the object does not traverse the intervening distance and hence the speed of teleportation , in principle , need not be restricted by the speed of light .    in the classical world of today , if we want to transmit an object such as this page to a reader some distance away , we will probably use a facsimile machine .",
    "this is very different from teleportation in two ways : first , the original is not destroyed at the source , and second , what is received at the destination can not be an _ exact _ replica .",
    "it can not be exact because of quantum mechanics .",
    "no matter how sophisticated the facsimile machine is , the individual lettering in this page is made up of atoms and sub - atomic particles .",
    "when the light from the facsimile machine shines on them to determine their exact position on the page , they impart them with a random momentum which will displace them randomly .",
    "this is heisenberg s uncertainty principle at work which states that it is impossible to specify simultaneously two quantities whose operators do not commute , such as position and momentum , precisely .",
    "thus , the lettering that is transmitted is never exactly what was fed to the facsimile machine .",
    "there must be some distortion .",
    "what is true of a classical object such as this page of text , is even more true of a quantum object . generally speaking",
    ", it is impossible to measure all the attributes of a quantum state simultaneously and exactly . therefore , it is impossible to clone a quantum object .",
    "this is the basis of the _ quantum no - cloning theorem_.",
    "even though quantum mechanics forbids cloning or copying , it does not forbid teleportation where the original object is sent _ absolutely intact _ to the destination , but is then unavailable ( effectively destroyed ) at the source .",
    "achieving this feat requires the use of einstein - podolsky - rosen pairs which are twin quantum objects that are forever correlated in some way .",
    "this correlation or `` entanglement '' can occur if the two quantum objects have interacted at some time in the past .",
    "albert einstein , boris podolsky and nathan rosen ( henceforth called epr ) came up with the following gedanken experiment to question the validity of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "imagine the two electrons of a hydrogen molecule .",
    "these two electrons have interacted to form the molecule and are in the bonding state where their spins are known to be anti - parallel ( singlet state ) .",
    "now , an explosion rips the molecule apart and sends one electron to new york and the other to tokyo . at this time , we know that the two electrons have opposite spins , but we do not know which one has upspin ( measured in some basis ) and which one has downspin",
    ". we will now attach labels to the two electrons ( electrons are still treated as equals and indistinguishable particles ) and denote the tokyo electron with subscript 1 and the new york electron with subscript 2 .",
    "the `` spin part '' of the actual two electron wave function must then be written as @xmath49 this wave function indicates that either the tokyo electron s spin is `` up '' and the new york electron s spin is `` down '' , or vice versa .",
    "these two possibilities have exactly the same probability .",
    "note that even though we do not know the spin of either electron , we know that they are always anti - parallel . therefore , the spins of these two electrons , separated by the vast pacific ocean , have become entangled like siamese twins .",
    "epr was interested in a paradox that questioned the completeness of quantum theory .",
    "let us concentrate on the electron in tokyo and forget about the one in new york for a moment .",
    "the spin part of the tokyo electron s wave function is aptly written as @xmath50 that is , its spin has equal probability of being `` up '' and `` down '' .",
    "now , let us say , we measure the spin in new york using a stern gerlach apparatus and find it to be `` up '' .",
    "we will immediately know that the tokyo electron s spin is `` down '' .",
    "we have therefore collapsed the tokyo electron s spin wave function ( given by equation [ tokyo ] ) to the `` down '' state , and at the same time , received information about the spin ( namely , that it is `` down '' ) , by performing a measurement in new york .",
    "the information about the tokyo electron s spin has therefore traveled to new york instantaneously with infinite speed thereby breaking the light speed barrier .",
    "epr argued that this is impossible and therefore quantum mechanics must be incomplete .",
    "to remedy the situation , it was proposed that there must be local hidden variables in quantum mechanics which , when properly accounted for , can solve this conundrum .",
    "but in 1964 , bell proved a mathematical inequality , that showed that there are no _ local _ hidden variables in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , there can be _ non - local _ hidden variables that could allow violation of bell s inequality and reconcile the epr paradox with quantum mechanics . in 1982 ,",
    "aspect , dalibard and roger , demonstrated the violation of bell s inequality using entangled photon pairs ( whose polarizations are entangled ) , thereby demonstrating non - local hidden variables .",
    "collapse of the wave function is a very unique type of interaction that is non - local unlike the known forces in nature ( electroweak , gravity , and strong interactions ) .",
    "the predictions of quantum mechanics have never been proven false .      mathematically , the wave functions of the entangled state of two particles are such that they can not be written as the product of the wave functions of each particle .",
    "recall the epr spin pairs in new york and tokyo .",
    "the wave function of the tokyo electron s spin is given by equation [ tokyo ] and similarly the wave function of the new york electron s spin will be given by    @xmath51    note that the product of equation [ tokyo ] and [ ny ] does not yield equation [ entangled ] .",
    "the wave function of the entangled state of two objects can not be written as the product of the wave functions of each one of them .      in 1993 ,",
    "charles bennet and his co - workers showed how entangled epr pairs can be used to teleport a quantum object or more correctly , the quantum attribute of an object , over arbitrary distances @xcite .",
    "this will not allow us to teleport an entire electron physically , but we can teleport its _ spin state _ to another electron at a remote location . since electrons are indistinguishable particles , this is indeed tantamount to teleporting the electron .",
    "consider the case where a qubit is encoded in the spin of a single electron ( particle 1 ) .",
    "the spin wave function or qubit is written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 = 1 .    to teleport this object from a sender alice to a receiver bob",
    ", we will need alice and bob to have shared in the past an epr pair which we will call particles 2 and 3 .",
    "particle 2 is with alice and particle 3 resides with bob .",
    "their joint state wave function can be written as equation [ entangled ] with just the labels altered .",
    "@xmath54    at this point ,",
    "particle 1 is still uncorrelated with particles 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , we can write the three - particle ( or three - spin ) wave function as a product between @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57    these states are called bell basis states and they are mutually orthogonal .",
    "note that the first two states are singlet and the last two are triplet .",
    "hence a measurement of total spin will separate these two subgroups . then within each subgroup , one state is symmetric in spin and the other is antisymmetric . since the total two - body wave function ( spin + spatial part ) must be anti",
    "- symmetric , a symmetric state in spin implies that the spatial part of the wave function must be anti - symmetric and vice versa .",
    "thus measurement of the symmetry of the spatial part and the total spin is sufficient to identify the actual state among the four given in equation [ bell ] .",
    "the purpose of alice s bell measurement is to complete this unambiguous identification .",
    "using equation [ bell ] , we can re - write equation 55 as @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the column vector notation of equation [ one ] , we can re - write the above equation as @xmath59\\ ] ]    the 3-particle state is now such that if alice s bell measurement reveals that particles 1 and 2 are in state @xmath60 , then bob s particle 3 encodes the qubit @xmath61 .",
    "if alice s measurement reveals the state @xmath62 , then bob s particle 3 encodes the qubit @xmath63 , if alice s measurement revelas the state @xmath64 , then bob s particle 3 encodes the qubit @xmath65 , and finally if alice s measurement revelas the state @xmath66 , then bob s particle 3 encodes the qubit @xmath67 .",
    "after the bell measurement , alice will know how the state of bob s particle 3 is related to the original qubit ( particle 1 ) , but bob does not . so alice must send bob the result of the bell measurement . since there are four possible outcomes of the bell measurement",
    ", alice needs to send bob two classical bits telling him which outcome was observed .",
    "accordingly , bob applies a unitary transformation to particle 3 to re - create particle 1 and hence the qubit .",
    "these unitary transformations are @xmath68    note that since alice must send bob 2 classical bits to help him transform his particle 3 to particle 1 , particle 1 was not teleported to bob instantly .",
    "there was no superluminal signaling .",
    "the classical bits must travel to bob with speed equal to or less than the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "there is one subtle exception however .",
    "one fourth of the time ( corresponding to @xmath60 ) , bob does not have to apply any transformation ( apart from an irrelevant phase factor of @xmath14 ) to his particle 3 in order to re - create particle 1 .",
    "therefore , if alice and bob are content to live with a 25% success rate , instant teleportation is possible",
    ". it does not violate relativistic dictates since no definite information is being transmitted .",
    "in fact , the 25% teleportation has been demonstrated experimentally by zeilinger s group in austria .",
    "no review article is ever complete . but this review will be seriously amiss if we do not mention a few words about quantum `` memory '' . most of the attention in the field of quantum computing has be focused on quantum logic , and very little on quantum memory .    quantum memory is an important constituent of quantum information science .",
    "it has many applications : ( i ) increasing the efficiency of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols ( the receiver bob stores the received qubits in a quantum memory and measures them _ after _ the sender alice tells him the bases ) , ( ii ) improving the epr - based qkd schemes @xcite , ( iii ) teleporting a state using singlet pairs prepared in advance , ( iv ) new schemes for qkd that rely on the existence of short - term memory @xcite , ( v ) attacking oblivious transfer and quantum bit commitment schemes @xcite , etc .    the requirements for quantum memory are thought to be very different from those of quantum gates .",
    "in a quantum gate , the qubits are accessed and rotated numerous times , but the coherence time need not be very long ; it simply has to be much longer than the switching time .",
    "in contrast , the qubits in a quantum memory are seldom accessed , but they must live much longer ( ideally `` forever '' ) without decohering .",
    "one must also be able to access them with high fidelity .",
    "since this review has focused on spintronic solid - state realizations of quantum logic , we will stick to the spintronic solid state realization of quantum memory .",
    "this is no easy task since spin coherence times , although longer than charge coherence times , are still very short . as a result ,",
    "_ non - volatile _ quantum static memories ( q - srams ) are not appropriate ; rather , quantum _ dynamic memories _ ( q - drams ) may be possible if the qubit can be _ refreshed _ periodically through refresh cycles .",
    "below , we explore possible routes to refreshing the quantum state of a quanton @xcite .",
    "it is very possible that refreshing can be accomplished through the",
    "_ quantum zeno effect _ which postulates that repeated observations of a qubit will inhibit its decay @xcite .",
    "repeated observations automatically serve as refresh cycles . however",
    ", this repeated observation has to be carried out by a non - invasive detector .",
    "a ballistic point contact has been used in the past as a non - invasive charge detector for electrons in quantum dots @xcite , and its role in the context of the quantum zeno effect has been examined @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to use a spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscope tip as a non - invasive probe for spin , but that is yet to be realized in practice .",
    "but what happens if the probe is an `` invasive '' probe ? all is not lost .",
    "it may be possible to re - create the entire qubit ( including the phase ) after it has `` interacted '' with the probe .",
    "this involves _",
    "quantum erasure _ @xcite as explained below .",
    "consider a quanton in a coherent superposition of two spin states , described by a wave function @xmath69    a fundamental result of quantum measurement theory is that if the spin analyzer tries to detect the spin of the incoming quanton , the interaction between the detector and the quanton causes the wave function of the detector to become entangled with that of the quanton .",
    "the entangled ( non - factorizable ) wave function is @xmath70 where the wave functions @xmath3 and @xmath71 span the hilbert space of the detector .",
    "thus , @xmath3 corresponds to the detector ( spin - analyzer ) passing an up - spin quanton , and @xmath71 corresponds to the detector reflecting a downspin quanton .",
    "if we make a measurement of whether the detector passed the quanton ( corresponding to the determination that the quanton s spin was `` up '' ) , the probability amplitude of that is @xmath72 since the detector makes an `` unambiguous '' determination , meaning that it _",
    "always _ passes an upspin quanton and _ never _ passes a downspin quanton , the wave functions @xmath3 and @xmath71 are orthogonal , meaning that upspin detection and downspin detection are mutually exclusive ( a quanton can not be simultaneously both upspin and downspin , and the detector will unambiguously determine what the spin is ) .",
    "hence , from equation ( 62 ) , @xmath73 and we get no information about @xmath74 , or the phase .",
    "this is interpreted as wave function collapse .",
    "however , the entanglement of the detector with the quanton ( equation ( 61 ) ) does not itself cause irreversible collapse .",
    "it is not irreversible since if we design an experiment whose result is the probability of a particular outcome of the spin measurement _ and _ finding the detector in the symmetric state ( @xmath75 ) , then the corresponding probability amplitude is @xmath76|\\phi > & = & a_{\\uparrow } |\\uparrow > < 1|1 > + a_{\\downarrow }     < 2|1 > \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a_{\\uparrow } |\\uparrow > + a_{\\downarrow } |\\downarrow > \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\psi ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the original wave function .",
    "hence , we can restore the original wave function @xmath77 from the entangled wavefunction @xmath78 .",
    "this is possible since equation ( 61 ) still represents a `` pure '' state and not a `` mixed '' state .",
    "note that if we can find the detector in the symmetric state , we would not have known whether the quanton that passed through it was `` up '' or `` down '' , and hence we would not have collapsed the wave function .",
    "thus , by finding the detector in the symmetric state , we have foregone any information about the spin and hence restored the original coherent superposition state from the entangled state ( quanton entangled with detector ) .",
    "the quantum erasure is possible because the entangled wave function @xmath78 is still a pure state and not a mixed state .",
    "= 4.3 in = 3.4 in    what do we need to implement quantum erasure ?",
    "we need only one difficult and ambitious technological feat .",
    "when the quanton passes through the spin analyzer , it should be able to rotate the magnetization of the analyzer and _ change it _ in a particular way .",
    "if the polarizer and analyzer were originally magnetized in the + z - direction , the passage of the quanton through the analyzer must turn on some interaction that results in the analyzer getting magnetized in the + x - direction .",
    "[ erasure ] depicts this situation .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 corresponds to the state of the detector whereby the analyzer is magnetized ( spin polarized ) in the + z - direction and @xmath71 corresponds to the state of the detector whereby the analyzer is magnetized in the -z - direction .",
    "thus , @xmath79\\ ] ] @xmath80\\ ] ] clearly @xmath3 and @xmath71 are orthogonal and the state @xmath75 corresponds to the state @xmath81 ~,\\ ] ] which corresponds to spin - polarization in the + x - direction .",
    "thus , we must find the analyzer polarized in the + x - direction after the quanton passes through it .",
    "in other words , the magnetization of the analyzer must be sensitive to the passage of a quanton and respond to it . at present , this is not possible ; but the recent discovery of control of magnetization via an electric current in inmnas @xcite may one day lead to a practical paradigm for acheiving this .",
    "in this review article , i have provided a bird s eye view of the current status of quantum information science from the perspective of a device engineer .",
    "this is one of the fastest growing fields judging by the number of new journals that are appearing with amazing frequency to disseminate many of the important new findings",
    ". this field will continue to grow and my only regret is that when this article appears in print it would probably have been already outdated .",
    "my interest in quantum computing was kindled at the quantum devices and circuits conference held in alexandria , egypt in 1996 which i co - organized .",
    "that conference included presentations by some of the pioneers in this field including charles bennet and umesh vazirani .",
    "i learnt a lot from my friend and colleague prof .",
    "vwani roychowdhury of ucla .",
    "the quantum dot realization of the toffoli - fredkin gate is the work of my ex - student prof .",
    "alexander balandin of the university of california - riverside during his tenure as a post - doctoral advisee in my group .",
    "i also acknowledge fruitful discussions with my colleagues professors frazer williams , natale ianno and david sellmyer of my erstwhile institution , the university of nebraska - lincoln with which i will always have a special connection .",
    "i have benefitted from discussions with prof .",
    "david janes of purdue university and dr .",
    "berry jonker of the naval research laboratory regarding fabrication and mbe growth .",
    "the work in spintronics is carried out in collaboration with prof .",
    "marc cahay of the university of cincinnati .          in this appendix",
    ", we will derive the total spin - splitting in a quantum dot capped by ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "consider the system shown in fig .",
    "[ appendix ] .",
    "the ferromagnetic contacts give rise to an in - built magnetic field in the x - direction which can be quite strong in realistic structures ( @xmath82 1 tesla ) .",
    "there may be an electric field in the x - direction as well to maintain single electron occupancy and an electric field in the y - direction to induce the rashba effect .",
    "the total hamiltonian for an electron in the semiconductor layer is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the land g - factor , @xmath85 is the electronic charge , @xmath86 is the bohr magneton , @xmath87 is the x - component of the pauli spin matrix , and @xmath88 is the rashba interaction given by @xmath89 = { { e \\hbar}\\over{2m^{*2 } c^2 } } { \\vec { \\cal e } }   \\cdot   { \\vec \\sigma } \\times { \\vec p}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the pauli spin matrix , @xmath91 is the momentum operator , and @xmath92 is the electric field inducing the rashba effect",
    ".    we will neglect the effect of the x - directed electric field on the rashba effect and include only the effect of the y - directed field which is much larger since the potential applied along the x - direction must be smaller than @xmath93 to maintain coulomb blockade . in any case , the x - directed field has no rashba effect on x - polarized spins , and we are interested in the energy splitting between the + x and -x - polarized spins .",
    "therefore , @xmath94\\ ] ]    the zeeman term @xmath95 introduces an zeeman splitting between the + x - polarized spin ( @xmath96 ) and the -x - polarized spin ( @xmath97 ) . if the potential confining the electron in the semiconductor quantum dot is finite ( the conduction band offset between the semiconductor and the surrounding material is finite ) , then the spatial parts of the `` upspin '' ( + x - polarized ) and `` downspin '' ( -x - polarized ) states are slightly different .",
    "the wave function of the higher energy state will be spread out a little bit more .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "thus , if the downspin state is at a higher energy , then the spatial parts of the wave functions of the two spin states in the lowest spin - split subband of the quantum dot can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath102 @xmath100 @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath100 @xmath105 .",
    "these widths are larger than the physical dimensions of the quantum dot since the wave functions will leak out into the barrier as long as the barrier is not of infinite height .",
    "the point of this exercise is to show that the spatial parts of the two spin states are different because of the zeeman splitting .",
    "this is a critical requirement for the rashba splitting .",
    "we will expand @xmath77 in the basis functions of the two lowest spin - resolved subband states .",
    "we can neglect the higher subband states as long as the rashba spin splitting @xmath108 is much smaller than the energy separation between the lowest two subbands in the quantum dot . if the effective mass is equal to the free electron mass and the dimensions of the quantum dot in all directions is about 10 nm , then the energy separation between the two lowest subbands is 33 mev .",
    "this is obviously much larger than any reasonable rashba splitting which scarcely exceeds 1 mev .",
    "hence , neglecting the higher subbands is justified .",
    "@xmath110    \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }               a_{\\uparrow } \\\\",
    "a_{\\downarrow } \\\\",
    "\\end{array }    \\right ) = e_{ground }   \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }               a_{\\uparrow } \\\\",
    "a_{\\downarrow } \\\\",
    "\\end{array }    \\right ) ~,\\ ] ]      diagonalizing the above hamiltonian , we get that the total splitting between the upspin and downspin states is @xmath123 where @xmath124 = @xmath125 = @xmath126 = 0 and @xmath127 = @xmath128 = @xmath129 .",
    "the last term under the radical is the rashba effect which can be varied by the electric field @xmath131 .",
    "note that this term would have vanished if @xmath101 = @xmath99 , that is , if the spatial parts of the upspin and downspin wave functions were identical . here , we have made the spatial parts different by using a finite potential barrier and a magnetic field to raise the energy of the downspin state above that of the upspin state .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of the rashba splitting in realistic systems .",
    "assuming @xmath101 = 10 nm , @xmath99 = 11 nm , @xmath131 = 10@xmath132 v / m , @xmath133 = 1 tesla , @xmath84 = 2 , we find that increasing the electric field from 10@xmath132 v / m to twice that value increases the rashba splitting by about 1.5 @xmath134ev .",
    "thus , the modulation of the splitting is very small .",
