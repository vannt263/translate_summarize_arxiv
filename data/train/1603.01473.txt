    "the goal of this paper is to study the optimal and exact control problem of the following scalar conservation laws with discontinuous flux @xmath0 where the flux @xmath1 is given by , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the heaviside function . through out the present article we assume the fluxes @xmath4 to be @xmath5 , strictly convex with superlinear growth ; @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the unique minima of the fluxes @xmath4 respectively .",
    "there is no literature concerning reachable set or any sort of optimal controllability results for equations of type ( [ conlaw - equation ] ) . in the present paper",
    "we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the reachable set and we prove the existence of a minimizer for an optimal control problem . in order to obtain an initial data control or finding minimizer of optimal control ,",
    "we use a new backward resolution .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it is constructive and easy to compute .",
    "the main difficulty of this backward resolution is that there are no rarefactions originating from the interface @xmath8 , then one can not just generalize , to the case @xmath9 the backward construction given in @xcite for the case in @xmath10 .    in order to state our main results , we need to introduce various notations and technical arguments hence the main theorems [ maintheoremop ] and [ exact - control ] have been postponed to the sections [ section : optimalcontrol ] and [ section : exactcontrol ] respectively .",
    "the scalar conservation laws with discontinuous flux of type ( [ conlaw - equation ] ) has a huge variety of applications in several fields , namely traffic flow modeling , modeling gravity , modeling continuous sedimentation in clarifier - thickener units , ion etching in the semiconductor industry and many more .    in the past two decades the first order model of type ( [ conlaw - equation ] )",
    "has been extensively studied from both the theoretical and numerical point of view . concerning the uniqueness it is worth to mention that the following krukov type entropy inequalities in both the two upper quarter - planes are not sufficient to guarantee the uniqueness ,    @xmath11    here @xmath12 denote the entropy pairs for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , a non - negative test function .",
    "consequently one need an extra criteria on the interface called `` interface entropy condition '' ( see @xcite ) given by @xmath15 using this extra entropy along with the above krukov type inequalities the uniqueness result has been obtained in @xcite . on the other hand , the existence result has been proved in several ways , namely via hamilton - jacobi , convergence of numerical schemes , vanishing viscosity method , for further details we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the present paper uses the explicit formula obtained in @xcite , via the hamilton - jacobi cauchy problem . by using this formula",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath16 is uniformly lipschitz then @xmath17 is also uniformly lipschitz for all @xmath18 and if we denote @xmath19 , it follows easily that @xmath20 is the unique weak solution ( see @xcite ) satisfying ( [ kruzkov2 ] ) , enjoys ( [ entropy - condition ] ) near interface and satisfies the following rankine - hugoniot condition on the interface .",
    "@xmath21 regarding the well - posedness theory to @xmath10 case , we refer the reader to @xcite for cauchy problem and for the initial boundary value problem to @xcite .    through out this paper we work with the solution which is obtained from the hamilton - jacobi formulation .    concerning the exact controllability for the scalar convex conservation laws",
    "the first work has been done in @xcite , where they considered the initial boundary value problem in a quarter plane with @xmath22 and by using one boundary control they investigated the reachable set . as in @xcite",
    ", they considered @xmath6 and three possible cases , namely pure initial value problem with initial data control outside any domain , initial boundary value problem in a quarter plane with one boundary control and initial boundary problem in a strip with two boundary controls to get the reachable sets in a complete generality . in both the articles",
    "the lax - oleinik type formulas has been exploited .",
    "an alternative approach has been provided in @xcite by using the return method ( see @xcite ) . for the viscous burgers equation",
    "any non - zero state can be reached in finite time by two boundary controls @xcite . a general theory for the system of conservation laws",
    "is still largely unavailable , nevertheless in @xcite , the authors constructed an example showing that exact controllability to a constant can not be reached in a finite time and proved asymptotic stabilization to a constant by two boundary controls . recently , under dissipative boundary conditions the asymptotic stabilization to @xmath23 has been proved in @xcite for @xmath24 system , when the velocities are positive . for the temple class systems and triangular type systems we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "let us briefly discuss the optimal controllability results for the case @xmath10 .",
    "assume the target function @xmath25 , @xmath26 , we denote by @xmath27 , a cost functional , defined in the following way @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 outside a compact set , @xmath31 being the only critical point of the flux @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 denotes the unique weak solution at @xmath34 to the cauchy problem ( [ conlaw - equation ] ) , in the case @xmath10 with initial datum @xmath35 . then in this case",
    ", the optimal control reads like : find a @xmath36 such that @xmath37 in @xcite , they considered the above optimal control problem for the burgers equation and proved such minimizer exists and proposed a numerical scheme called `` alternating decent algorithm '' , although the convergence of these scheme still remains open .",
    "whereas in @xcite , they made use of the lax - oleinik formula and derived a numerical backward construction which converges to a solution of the above problem .",
    "the latter method can be applied also to general convex fluxes as long as a lax - oleinik type formula is available .",
    "it has to be noticed that even for the case @xmath10 , due to the occurrence of the shocks in the solution of ( [ conlaw - equation ] ) , one may have several minimizers of the optimal control problem ( [ optimalcontrolf = g ] ) .",
    "we organize the paper in the following manner , section 2 deals with the existing results collected from @xcite .",
    "section 3 consists of some important lemmas and the backward construction .",
    "then we state and prove the result concerning optimal controllability in section 4 . finally in section 5 , we state and",
    "prove the exact controllability result .",
