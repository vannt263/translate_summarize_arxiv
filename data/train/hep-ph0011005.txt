    "the study of rare b - decays is one of the most important research areas in particle physics and there is an experimental effort for studying them at various centers such as slac ( babar ) , kek ( belle ) , b - factories , desy ( hera - b ) . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "they are induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at loop level and therefore they are sensitive to the fundamental parameters , like cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants , etc .",
    "these decays also provide a sensitive test to the new physics beyond the sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc",
    ".    among the rare b decays , @xmath3 process , induced by the inclusive @xmath4 decay , is attractive since the only non - perturbative quantity in the theoretical calculation is the decay constant of @xmath5 which is reliably known . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the measurement of the hadronic decay is easier compared to its inclusive channel .",
    "the measurement of upper limit of @xmath6 @xcite @xmath7 stimulated the study of @xmath3 decays . in the literature , this process ( @xcite-@xcite ) and its inclusive one @xmath8 ( @xcite-@xcite ) have been investigated extensively in the sm , 2hdm and supersymmetric model ( susy ) .",
    "when @xmath9 , the neutral higgs boson ( nhb ) effects are safely neglected in the 2hdm because they enter in the expressions with the factor @xmath10 . however , for @xmath11 , this factor is not negligible and nhb effects can give important contribution . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath12 process was studied in the 2hdm and it was shown that nhb effects are sizable for large values of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the main observation of these calculations is the enhancement of the branching ratio ( @xmath14 ) of these decays for large @xmath13 values in the 2hdm and minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , especially for @xmath11 lepton case . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath15 process has been studied in the general 2hdm with real yukawa couplings and it was found that the @xmath14 has been enhanced for large values of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath18 decay in the general 2hdm , so - called model iii .",
    "our calculations are based on the results of the work @xcite for the inclusive @xmath19 decay . here",
    "we include nhb effects and make the full calculation using the on - shell renormalization prescription .",
    "the investigation of the dependencies of the @xmath14 on the model parameters , namely @xmath20 and @xmath2 , shows that a large enhancement in the @xmath14 is possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the leading order ( lo ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian and the corresponding matrix element for the exclusive @xmath21 decay in the framework of the model iii .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the dependencies of the @xmath14 on the the yukawa couplings @xmath20 , @xmath2 and to the discussion of our results . in appendices ,",
    "we present the operators appearing in the effective hamiltonian and their wilson coefficients .",
    "the general yukawa interaction in the model iii is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote chiral projections @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 , are two scalar doublets .",
    "here @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the yukawa matrices and , in general , they have complex entries . the choice of scalar higgs doublets @xmath30\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\\\ \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c }   \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h^1+i h^2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\nonumber \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the vacuum expectation values , @xmath31 and the gauge and @xmath32 invariant higgs potential which spontaneously breaks @xmath33 down to @xmath34 : @xmath35 ^ 2 + c_4 [ ( \\phi_1^+ \\phi_1 ) ( \\phi_2^+ \\phi_2)-(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^+ \\phi_1 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   c_5 [ re(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2 + c_{6 } [ im(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2   + c_{7 } \\ , , \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where constants @xmath36 , permits us to carry the sm particles in the first doublet and the information about the new physics by the second one .",
    "the yukawa interaction @xmath37 describes the flavor changing ( fc ) one beyond the sm . here , the couplings @xmath38 for the charged fc interactions are @xmath39 and @xmath40 where the index `` @xmath41 '' in @xmath42 denotes the word `` neutral '' .",
    "notice that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mass eigenstates @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , since no mixing occurs between two cp - even neutral bosons @xmath47 and @xmath45 in the tree level , for our choice .",
    "the exclusive @xmath18 process is induced by the inclusive @xmath19 decay .",
    "therefore we start with the effective hamiltionian of @xmath19 decay _ eff & = & v_tb v_ts^ * c_9^eff ( |s _ p_l b ) |_+ c_10 ( |s _ p_l b ) |__5 + & - & 2 c_7 ( |s i _ p_p_r b ) | _ + c_q_1(|s p_r b ) |+c_q_2 ( |s p_r b ) |_5  , [ hamilton ] with @xmath48 , the sum of the momenta of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the wilson coefficients normalized at the scale @xmath53 and given in appendix b. the additional wilson coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 are due to the nhb exchange diagrams ( see appendix b ) . in calculating the @xmath56 ,",
    "one first integrates out the heavy degrees of freedom , namely @xmath57 quark , @xmath58 and @xmath59 bosons in the present case and then obtain the effective theory . here",
    "@xmath60 denote charged , and @xmath47 , @xmath61 , @xmath59 denote neutral higgs bosons .",
    "note that @xmath61 and @xmath59 are the same as the mass eigenstates @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the model iii respectively . at this stage",
    "the qcd corrections are added through matching the full theory with the effective low energy one at the high scale @xmath64 and evaluating the wilson coefficients from @xmath65 down to the lower scale @xmath66 .    in the model iii ,",
    "the neutral higgs particles bring additional contributions ( see eq.([nhb ] ) ) since the mass of @xmath67 lepton or related yukawa coupling @xmath68 enter into the expressions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally the neutral higgs boson ( nhb ) contributions are calculated using the on - shell renormalization scheme to overcome the logarithmic divergences .",
    "using the renormalization condition @xmath69 the counter term @xmath70 and then the renormalized vertex function @xmath71 is obtained . here",
    "the phrase @xmath72 denotes the neutral higgs bosons @xmath47",
    ", @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath73 is the momentum transfer .    for the exclusive decay @xmath21",
    ", @xmath56 is to be taken between vacuum and @xmath74 state as @xmath75 and this matrix element can be expressed in terms of the @xmath76 decay constant @xmath77 using & = & -i f_b_sp _ [ ff1 ] , + < 0||s _ 5 b|b^0_s > & = & i f_b_s [ ff2 ] , + < 0||s _ p_r b|b^0_s > & = & 0 .",
    "[ ff3 ] since @xmath48 , the @xmath78 term in eq.([hamilton ] ) gives zero on contraction with the lepton bilinear , @xmath79 gives zero by eq.([ff3 ] ) and the @xmath80 term gets a factor of @xmath81 while the remaining @xmath82 and @xmath83 terms get @xmath84 , when taking @xmath85 .",
    "thus the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) results in the following decay amplitude for @xmath21 a & = & m_b_s f_b_s v_tb v^*_ts c_q_1 | + ( c_q_2 - 2 c_10 ) | _ 5 . to calculate the branching ratio we find the square of this amplitude",

    "in the multi - higgs doublet models , there are many free parameters , such as masses of charged and neutral higgs bosons and the yukawa couplings . in the present work we study our process in the general 2hdm ,",

    "note that the enhancement for the increasing values of the @xmath104 is due to the dependence of the @xmath14 on the nhb effects .",
