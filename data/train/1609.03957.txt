    "einstein s gravity has been considered for many years as the physics of the universe and the standard model of the modern cosmology is based on this theory",
    ". however , also it is well known if we are searching for one complete description of the universe we need to use complements , in particular we are using different kind of matter in order to do an approximate description of the actual universe .",
    "for example at the early universe we need to introduce the inflationary paradigm in order to solve some problem of the standard model , and it is introduced the inflaton field in order to have the adequate expansion , and perturbation as seed of the large structure of the universe @xcite . from the current observation",
    "we need to introduce the dark energy in order to do an approximation to the observational data and touch the property theoretical description of our currently observations .",
    "we can continue doing this addition of elements or complement to the standard cosmological model in order to solve problems in the prediction , in some cases , or to fit with the more and more precise astronomical data @xcite .",
    "alternative , we can change the background of the theory and we could consider modification to the einstein s theory of gravity , as was done in tensor - scalar theories or jordan - brans - dicke theory @xcite . on the other hand , we can use actions from higher dimensional theories or string theory , as the effective theory in the low energy limit @xcite . also , we could do the modification of the theory or the action , in a straightforward way , using a variational principle more general , for example where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are arbitrary functions of the corresponding variables .",
    "this action implies different consequences , and we need to have in mind the basic principles of physics and therefore gravity .",
    "the consequences can be see direct in the equation of motions , we must ask a priori ( according to the basic principles ) , a covariant formulation of equation of motion , the dynamics it is driven by second order differential equation , and it must satisfy the correspondence principle . however , the non - linear function @xmath0 and @xmath1 provided the general invariant that can meet at least two of this requirement , unfortunately we must deal with higher order differential equation as equation of motion .",
    "of course here we have matter described by a scalar field , the way as this was introduced in einstein s gravity through the minimal coupling , between geometry and matter . in the action ( [ action1 ] )",
    ", we are considering in @xmath1 function the more general no - minimal coupling between the scalar field and gravity .",
    "of course this new coupling modify the usual klein - gordon equation , and therefore the field equation for the scalar field is not longer a second order differential equation in this general case , as an example of this higher dynamics see refs .",
    "it is clear that the modification of gravity in this way can be done by modification of the geometry @xmath2 ) or modification of matter sector @xmath3 , this last choice we would like to discuss in more details .",
    "currently there are a growing interest in the called horndeski lagrangian @xcite the more general scalar field lagrangian with non - minimal couplings between the scalar field and the curvature , and at the same time producing second order motion equations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , was found that the equation of motion for the scalar field can be reduced to second order differential equation , when it is kinetically coupled to the einstein tensor , @xmath4 , and in ref .",
    "@xcite the author investigated the cosmological scenarios for this kind of coupling . in this case",
    "the action is described by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 corresponds to the determinant of the space - time metric @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the ricci scalar and @xmath9 is the einstein tensor . here the parameter @xmath10 is a constant with dimension of mass , and @xmath11 corresponds to the effective potential associated to the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 and its sign plays a critical role in this type of theory . recently in ref.@xcite was studied the screening horndeski cosmologies in which the ghost - free cosmological solutions occur if the parameter @xmath14 . however , analyzing the dynamical stability in these solutions was found that they are stable in the future but unstable in the past ( initial spacetime singularity ) . in ref.@xcite was suggested that the parameter @xmath15 in order to evade the ghost presents in the model .",
    "also in ref.@xcite was shown that independently of the value of @xmath13 the model does not present instabilities . in this form",
    ", we mention that the sign of @xmath13 positive or negative is still an open issue in the literature , in particular for the early universe . in the following",
    "we will consider the value @xmath15 in order to study the early universe .",
    "however , we mention that for negative values of the parameter @xmath13 , we would have to add the condition @xmath16 , in order to evade possible imaginary quantities in our model .",
    "the equation of motions for the geometry from the variation of the metric @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the usual energy momentum tensor for the matter , @xmath20 and the new component is given by @xmath21 the variation of the action respect to the scalar field @xmath22 gives its equation of motion @xmath23    in relation to the cosmological consequences in non - minimally derivative coupling to gravity were studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "also , the theory of the density perturbation in the early universe with this non - minimally derivative coupling was analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the reheating of the universe is a procedure in which the scalar field or inflaton field is converted into the standard model particles@xcite . during reheating of the universe ,",
    "the best part of the matter and radiation of the universe are created via the decay of the scalar field or inflaton . specifically , an important quantity known as the reheating temperature , @xmath24 can be found during this process .",
    "this quantity is associated to the temperature of the universe when the radiation epoch begin .",
    "a lower bound by the reheating temperature from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the planck mass , was obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "also , an upper bound by the reheating temperature arrives from the energy scale at the end of the inflationary period and is given by @xmath27 .",
    "we mention that the first bayesian constraints on the single field inflationary reheating epoch from cosmic microwave background data was obtained in ref.@xcite , see also ref.@xcite .    in this respect , afterward of the inflationary period , the inflaton field experiments coherent oscillations at the bottom of an effective potential . in this form , an essential part in the mechanism of reheating",
    "are the oscillations of the inflaton field .",
    "nevertheless , there is in the literature some models where the effective potential does not have a minimum and then the inflaton field does not oscillate .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of reheating does not work . in the literature , these models or those potentials that does not have a minimum",
    "are known as non - oscillating ( no ) models@xcite .",
    "for this type of no model , the first mechanism of reheating was the gravitational particle production , nevertheless this mechanism becomes inefficient , see refs.@xcite .",
    "the instants preheating is another mechanism for the no model .",
    "the instants preheating incorporates an interaction between two scalar fields ; the inflaton and another field @xcite .",
    "another alternative proposal to the reheating of the universe in this type of no model , is the introduction of curvaton field @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is well known also that the curvaton field explains the observed large - scale adiabatic density perturbation during the early universe @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the adiabatic density perturbation is produced from the curvaton field and not from the inflaton field . in this framework ,",
    "the adiabatic density perturbation is originated afterward inflation epoch and from an initial condition associates to an isocurvature perturbation@xcite .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we assume the curvaton hypothesis , in which the observed value of the power spectrum the inflaton field @xmath29 is taken to be less than the power spectrum the curvaton @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless , we mention that in ref.@xcite was considered that the power spectrum generated by both fields are important .",
    "another important characteristics of the curvaton is that its energy density is subdominant while the inflation takes place and becomes dominant when the inflation finish .",
    "however , the curvaton survives to the expansion of the inflationary epoch . in this respect ,",
    "the curvaton reheating occurs when the curvaton decays after or before dominate its energy density .",
    "we mention that in ref.@xcite was studied a curvaton model , in which the curvaton has a nonminimal derivative coupling to gravity , see also ref.@xcite .    in the framework of a non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity",
    "we would like to introduce the curvaton field as a mechanism of reheating for any effective potentials that does not minimum i.e. , no models .",
    "therefore , the main aim of this paper is to carry out the curvaton field into the non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity for no models and see what consequences we may derive .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follow : in section ii we give a brief review of the non - minimal derivative coupling inflationary epoch . in section iii",
    "we analyze the kinetic epoch for non - minimal derivative coupling . in section",
    "iv we study the dynamic of the curvaton field .",
    "section v describes the curvaton decay after its domination . in section",
    "vi we analyze the decay of the curvaton field before it dominates the expansion of the universe . in section vii we study a specific example of no model , where we consider an exponential potential . at the end , in section viii",
    "includes our conclusions .",
    "in this section we will briefly review of the inflationary epoch in the framework the a non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity .      in order to describe the non - minimal derivative coupling inflationary model , we start with the corresponding field equations that must satisfy the scalar field in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background . from the action ( [ action2 ] ) we get @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter , @xmath34 is the scale factor , and @xmath35 . here",

    "the dots denote derivative with respect to the cosmological time @xmath38 , and we shall use units such that @xmath39 .    throughout inflation the energy density associated with the scalar field is of the order of potential energy density , and dominates over the kinetic energy , i.e. , @xmath40 , then the friedmann equation can be written as@xcite @xmath41 here we note that during inflation the condition @xmath40 or equivalently @xmath42 coincides with first slow roll approximation analyzed in ref.@xcite . in this form , the standard condition @xmath43 is modified in the inflationary scenario of non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity .    on the other hand , the universe can undergo a stage of accelerated expansion only if @xmath44 , and this condition is model - independent , otherwise the gravity decelerates the expansion .    in this form , considering that during inflation @xmath45 ( or equivalently @xmath46 and neglecting the acceleration of the scalar field , the equation of motion associated to the scalar field given by eq.([e2 ] ) , reduces to@xcite @xmath47 and the velocity of the scalar field @xmath48 becomes @xmath49 here we have used eq.([fi ] ) .",
    "we mention that the high friction limit is characterize by the condition @xmath50 .",
    "also , different inflationary models in this limit was developed in ref.@xcite and numerical simulations in ref.@xcite .",

    "in this section we analyze the kinetic epoch of the inflaton field .",
    "it is well known that when inflation has finished the model into the ` kinetic epoch ' ( or ` kination ' , for simplicity ) @xcite .",
    "the kinetic epoch occurs at the end of inflation when almost all the energy density of inflaton field is kinetic energy .",
    "however , we mention that the kinetic epoch does not take place immediately afterward of the inflationary epoch @xcite .    by assuming that during this epoch the kinetic energy @xmath63 @xmath64 and considering that the term @xmath65 , is very small compared to the non standard friction term and the acceleration of the scalar field in the field eq.([e2 ] ) , then the field equations during this epoch reduce to    @xmath66    and @xmath67 respectively .    from eq.([ddot ] ) we find a first integral given by @xmath68 and corresponds to the velocity of scalar field during the kinetic epoch . in the following , the subscription ` k ' , labels the different quantities at the starting of this epoch .",
    "combining eqs.([h2 ] ) and ( [ dphi ] ) , we obtain that during the kinetic epoch , the hubble parameter in terms of the scale factor results @xmath69 where the function @xmath70 is given by @xmath71^{1/3 } } + \\frac{\\left[b(a)+\\sqrt{4(\\frac{9a\\,a_k^6}{a^6}+1)^3+b(a)^2}\\,\\right]^{1/3}}{32^{1/3}}-\\frac{2}{3},\\ ] ] in which @xmath72    from the friedmann equation given by eq.([h2 ] ) , the energy density or kinetic energy @xmath73 , can be written as @xmath74 where the hubble parameter @xmath75 is given by eq.([ha ] ) and @xmath76 .     versus the scale factor @xmath77 , for different values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath78 during the kinetic epoch .",

    "we note that when we decrease the parameter @xmath84 , the hubble parameter during the kinetic epoch presents a small displacement with respect to the value of @xmath85 . also , we observe that the incorporation of the new parameter @xmath10 gives us a freedom that allows us to change the standard scenario of the kinetic epoch in gr .",
    "in this section we study the dynamic of the curvaton field @xmath28 , through different epochs . from the dynamic of the field",
    "@xmath28 , we can find the constraints upon the parameter in our model in order to obtain a viable model . for the dynamic , we assume that the curvaton field satisfies the klein - gordon equation with a scalar potential @xmath86 given by @xmath87 , where the parameter @xmath88 corresponds to the curvaton mass .",
    "firstly , we assume that the inflaton field coexists with the curvaton during the inflationary scenario . however , we consider that the energy density associate to the curvaton field @xmath89 is lower than the energy density of inflaton field , i.e. , @xmath90 , such that the inflaton field @xmath12 always drives the inflationary expansion of the early universe . in the next scenario ,",
    "the curvaton presents oscillations at the minimum of its effective potential @xmath86 . in this respect ,",
    "the dynamic of the energy density of curvaton field evolves as a non - relativistic matter and the expansion of the universe is even dominated by the inflaton field .",

    "this method to determine the reheating temperature in terms of the number of e - folds @xmath58 during the evolution of the universe , was introduced in ref.@xcite .    in this plot",
    "we have considered the values @xmath183 , @xmath184 from relation given by eq.([mm ] ) , @xmath195 see eq.([elec ] ) , and considering that @xmath196 then we have taken @xmath186 .",
    "we observe that the curves @xmath194 give an upper limit for the reheating temperature , when the curvaton decays after domination in the case of an exponential potential .",
    "also we note that when we increase the value of @xmath163 , the reheating temperature @xmath24 decreases to values @xmath197 for @xmath198 . here",
    "we note that this upper limit for the reheating temperature is similar to the gut scale , where the temperatute @xmath199 ( in units of @xmath26 ) .",
    "also , we observe that this upper limit in the @xmath24 , is similar to that found in ref.@xcite .    in fig.([fig4 ] ) we show the reheating temperature @xmath24 versus the number of e - folds @xmath58 when the curvaton field decays before it dominates the expansion of the universe . as before ,",
    "we have used three different values of the parameter @xmath163 , where the dot , solid and dashed lines are for the values @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 . from eq.([t2 ] ) we can find the reheating temperature @xmath24 as a function of the potential @xmath192 and together with eqs.([vend ] ) and ( [ nn ] ) , we numerically obtain the parametric plot @xmath194 . as before , in this plot we have used the values @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath195 .",

    "we note from fig.([fig4 ] ) that when we increase the value of the parameter @xmath163 , the reheating temperature @xmath24 decreases to values @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "in particular for the case in which @xmath203 and @xmath178 , we obtain that the reheating temperature @xmath204 , for the value @xmath177 corresponds to @xmath205 , and for the value @xmath176 corresponds to @xmath206 .",
    "it follows that one must increase the reheating temperature by three orders of magnitude to have a @xmath24 close to the @xmath207 .",
    "we have analyzed in general form and in detail the curvaton mechanism of reheating into the no models in the context of the non - minimal derivative coupling to gravity . in this framework",
    ", we have considered that the curvaton field drives the reheating the universe as well as for the curvature perturbations .",
    "also , we have studied the kinetic epoch in our model and we obtained the evolution of the hubble parameter and kinetic energy expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ ha ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) , respectively . in explaining the curvaton reheating we have studied two possible scenarios :",
    "i ) the curvaton field decays after it dominates the cosmic expansion of the universe and ii ) the curvaton decays before it dominates the expansion . during the first scenario ,",
    "we have found an upper limit for the parameter @xmath113 or equivalently an upper limit for the reheating temperature specified by eq.([t1 ] ) .",
    "for the second scenario , we have obtained an approximate value for the temperature expressed by eq.([t2 ] ) .    as a specific example of no model",
    ", we have studied an exponential potential . for this potential",
    "we have considered the method of constraining the reheating temperature indirectly from the inflationary period through the number of e - folds i.e. , @xmath208 . during the first scenario when the curvaton decays",
    "after it dominates the expansion , we have found that for values of @xmath173 , the reheating temperature is approximately @xmath197 ( in units of @xmath26 ) as an upper bound . in the second scenario when the curvaton decays before it dominates , we have obtained that the @xmath201 for values of @xmath173 .",
    "we noted that these values for the temperatures are similar to those found in ref.@xcite .",
