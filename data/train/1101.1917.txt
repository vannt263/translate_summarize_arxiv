    "while the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm for structure formation successfully describes cosmological observations on large ( cmb and cluster ) scales , there is notable disagreement with small - scale observations . among other issues , @xmath4-body simulations ( e.g. , via lactea  diemand et al .",
    "2008 ; aquarius  springel et al . 2008 ) predict the existence of numerous cdm subhalos , with masses @xmath5@xmath6 , embedded in galaxy - scale dark matter halos . this has proved troubling observationally , because there are many fewer dwarf galaxies in our own milky way than predicted by cdm . since the discrepancy may be due to baryon stripping from subhalos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we need ways to probe dark matter substructure directly , regardless of the presence of baryonic material .    gravitational lensing provides a unique way to detect cdm substructure in distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stars and cdm substructure perturb the lens potential on micro- to milli - arcsecond scales , which can have dramatic effects on the properties of lensed images . most notably , lensing from stars and dark matter substructure can alter the flux ratios from those of smooth mass distributions . as shown by @xcite , lens flux ratios depend on the size of the source compared to the size of the perturber .",
    "when the source is very small , it is effectively a point source for the lens substructure , so it feels an additional magnification boost ( @xmath7 ) over and above the macroscopic lens properties .",
    "as the source increases in size , @xmath8 may increase or decrease depending on the source s location relative to the substructure and the parity of the `` macro '' magnification .",
    "as the source grows still larger , it ceases to be affected by the substructure and @xmath9 .",
    "this phenomenon implies that by measuring flux ratios at different wavelengths , corresponding to different source sizes , we may be able to map substructure on a variety of scales ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "heuristically , a quasar emitting region of size @xmath10 is significantly affected by a subhalo with einstein radius @xmath11 only if @xmath12 . for typical lens and source redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , the einstein radius of a subhalo of mass @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "since the optically emitting regions of quasars have @xmath17@xmath18 cm @xcite , optical lens flux ratios are sensitive to both microlensing by stars and millilensing by cdm substructure .",
    "by contrast , the more extended infrared emitting regions with @xmath19 pc @xcite can only be affected by relatively massive subhalos . comparing lens flux ratios at different wavelengths",
    "therefore makes it possible to constrain the amount of micro- and milli - lensing present in the system , as well as the sizes of the perturbers .",
    "previous studies have used mid - ir observations to probe rest - frame ir emission , yielding evidence for subhalos with masses @xmath20 in the lenses b1422 + 231 and mg 0414 + 0534 @xcite , constraints on the mass of a luminous companion galaxy in h1413 + 117 @xcite , and null detections in several other systems @xcite . here",
    "we extend the study of wavelength - dependent flux ratios by using @xmath0 ( @xmath21 m ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath22 m ) images of six lenses obtained with gemini north during the 2008b semester .",
    "for source redshifts @xmath2 , the @xmath1-band images correspond to rest - frame emission at @xmath23 m where @xmath2420100% of the flux is thermal emission from the inner dusty torus @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath0-band flux comes mostly from the smaller accretion disk .",
    "thus , comparing @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux ratios may provide a sufficient source size baseline to identify substructure .    to be sure ,",
    "there are phenomena besides cdm substructure that may cause lens flux ratios to vary with wavelength .",
    "optical observations probe rest - frame uv emission from the accretion disk of the agn , so they are sensitive to microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical flux ratios can also be altered by differential extinction from dust in the lens galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , intrinsic variability in the source coupled with the lens time delay can cause flux ratios to vary with time , and the variability may be chromatic.100 , he 0435@xmath31223 , sbs 0909 + 523 , and he 2149@xmath32745 . ]",
    "all three effects should be attenuated at near - ir wavelengths , because the effective size of the accretion disk is larger and some of the flux originates in the larger dusty torus , but they may not be entirely absent . in particular , the importance of microlensing and intrinsic variability for @xmath1-band observations will depend on the relative strengths of the accretion disk ( 0.01 0.1 pc , @xmath25@xmath26 arcsec ) and dusty torus ( 0.55 pc , @xmath27@xmath28 arcsec ) emission .",
    "any significant wavelength - dependence in lens flux ratios is interesting , whether related to cdm substructure or not , so at minimum our observations can highlight systems that warrant further study .",
    "most lensing constraints on cdm substructure have relied on the identification of flux ratio anomalies , which is best done using four - image lenses .",
    "the reason is that identifying such anomalies requires either well - constrained lens models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or universal magnification relations that apply only to certain four - image configurations @xcite . however , the search for wavelength dependence in flux ratios is a purely observational task that may provide model - independent evidence for substructure .",
    "we are therefore able to analyze two - image lenses for the presence of substructure for the first time .",
    "some care is needed when interpreting the results ( see  [ sec : irdiscuss ] ) , but the observations are still valuable .",
    "to explore the multi - wavelength behavior of flux ratios , we obtained the first @xmath0 ( @xmath21 m ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath22 m ) images for six gravitational lenses using the near infrared imager ( niri ) located at the gemini north facility .",

    "multi - epoch observations of both systems have shown variations in the flux ratios at shorter wavelengths , which are presumably associated with quasar variability and/or microlensing .",
    "it is possible that the same phenomena affect the @xmath0-band flux ratios and explain the nir discrepancies . in that case",
    ", the flux ratios in @xmath1 or other longer - wavelength bands would be useful for limiting effects of quasar variability and microlensing in order to probe dark matter substructure .",
    "alternatively , it remains possible that chromatic millilensing causes the nir discrepancies . to test both hypotheses ,",
    "future observations are needed to quantify variability in multiple optical and nir bands .    finally , we detect no difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux ratios for q0142@xmath3100 and sbs 0909 + 523 .",
    "these results are interesting null detections , indicating that there is no substructure close to the images with masses in the right range to produce chromatic effects .",

    "<S> we examine the wavelength dependence of flux ratios for six gravitationally lensed quasars using @xmath0 and @xmath1 images obtained at the gemini north 8 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we select lenses with source redshifts @xmath2 so that @xmath0-band images probe rest - frame optical emission from accretion disks , while @xmath1-band images probe rest - frame near - infrared flux emitted ( in part ) from the more extended surrounding torus . since the observations correspond to different source sizes , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux ratios are sensitive to structure on different scales and may be useful for studying small - structure in the lens galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> four of the six lenses show differences between @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux ratios . in he 0435@xmath31223 , sdss 0246@xmath30825 , and he 2149@xmath32745 the differences may be attributable to known microlensing and/or intrinsic variability . in sdss 0806 + 2006 the wavelength dependence is not easily attributed to known variations , and may indicate the presence of substructure . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in q0142@xmath3100 and sbs 0909 + 523 the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux ratios are consistent within the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the utility of the current data for studying chromatic effects related to microlensing , dust extinction , and dark matter substructure . </S>"
