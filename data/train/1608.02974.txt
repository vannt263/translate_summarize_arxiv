    "there are no tricritical points but for intermediate @xmath15=0.3 , there are tricritical points . the crossover of critical exponents from ising to tricritical ising values was observed to have an unusual non - monotonic behavior .",
    "as the tricritical point is approached , the order - parameter exponent @xmath133 at first appears to rise substantially above the well - known ising value of @xmath138 before falling sharply to a number close to the expected tri - critical value of @xmath139 .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the nb@xmath0o@xmath1 materials can be tuned between first and second order transitions by varying pressure , doping or other parameters , thus giving rise to novel realizations of tricritical systems .",
    "however , our work suggests that some caution is needed , in that tricritical exponent values may be masked by rapid non - monotonic variations making it difficult to observe asymptotic exponent values in experiments .    in some materials which exhibit this 1dx1d geometry , the quantum mechanical nature of the degrees of freedom may be crucial to the observed phenomena .",
    "for example , in the optical lattice case , the focus is on the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation at finite momentum , and in a pattern of orbitals which alternates as @xmath140 on the two sublattices .",
    "our work shows that even at the classical level , these crossed - chains systems exhibit complex phase - transitions and crossovers .",
