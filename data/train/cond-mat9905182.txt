    "the experiments for bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in alkali atomic gases , such as @xmath4rb@xcite , @xmath3na@xcite , and @xmath5li@xcite , have been performed under a strong magnetic field since its experimental realization in alkali atomic gases in 1995 .",
    "they used the magnetic field to confine a bec system .",
    "because the atom spin direction adiabatically follows the magnetic field , the spin degrees of freedom are frozen in these magnetic trapping experiments@xcite .",
    "recently , the mit group has succeeded in creating bec by an optical dipole trap formed by a single infrared laser beam@xcite in which the spin degrees of freedom are all active ( @xmath6 of the @xmath2 atomic hyperfine state for @xmath3na ) .",
    "these atoms with the three hyperfine substates simultaneously undergo bose condensation , leading to a spinor bec , a situation analogous to superfluid @xmath7@xcite of a neutral fermion system or a triplet superconductor of a charged fermion system such as upt@xmath8@xcite .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom play a fundamentally important role for governing their physics .",
    "an advantage of the present spinor bec over @xmath7 or upt@xmath8 is that it is a weakly interacting system and we know fairly well how the ( quasi ) particles interact using the knowledge of atomic physics .",
    "these facts allow us to have a chance to construct a microscopic many - body theory from first principles , using only a few fundamental matter parameters .",
    "stimulated by the earliest optical trap experiment by stumper - kurn _",
    "et al._@xcite , general theoretical frameworks for describing a spinor bec were given independently by ohmi and machida@xcite and by ho@xcite .",
    "they are equivalent basically .",
    "the framework is based on bogoliubov theory which is extended to a vectorial order parameter with three components , corresponding to @xmath6 of the @xmath2 atomic hyperfine state , giving rise to generalized gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "they calculate low - lying collective modes such as sound wave , spin wave , and their coupled mode and predict various topological defect structures , or spin textures . we also note that there are many remarkable researches@xcite with the phase separation problem of a two - component bec consisting of different hyperfine states .",
    "subsequently , stenger _",
    "et al._@xcite produce an optically trapped spinor bec with a long cigar shape whose aspect ratio is over 40 and examine whether these three component bec can be either miscible or immiscible .",
    "the external magnetic field is applied along the long axis ( the @xmath9 axis ) to see the spin domain formation . after releasing the spinor bec , the stern - gerlach separation of the cloud",
    "is performed to reproduce the original domain structure .",
    "their analyses are based on the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , which neglects the kinetic energy , of the above generalized gp equations .",

    "this allows us to draw lines in @xmath48 phase diagram as a function of the interaction constant @xmath43 ( in their paper , @xmath49 ) .      in order to check whether or not their analysis based on the above assumptions ( 1-dimensional tf approximation , 1dtf ) agrees with the full 3-dimensional calculations of gp equation , we determine the spatial profiles of the rotationally - symmetric ( around the @xmath9 axis ) spinor condensate by solving the gp equation in the @xmath50 space using the difference between the scattering lengths @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and the peak density @xmath53 they estimated . assuming this , we compare the following three calculations by 1dtf , by 3-dimensional tf approximation ( 3dtf ) , and by 3-dimensional gp equation ( 3dgp ) . in 1dtf , it is assumed that the density is @xmath54 .",
