    "for our measurements we prepare a quantum degenerate cloud of @xmath56 fermions , harmonically confined in a crossed optical dipole trap .",
    "this is done by evaporatively cooling a balanced spin mixture of the two magnetic sub - levels @xmath1 , @xmath2 of the @xmath3 hyperfine manifold .",
    "we reach temperatures of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fermi temperature .",
    "this corresponds to an entropy of @xmath57 per particle in the harmonic trap .",
    "the atom number is set to a value of @xmath7 for all measurements .",
    "the repulsive on - site interaction energy @xmath17 is tuned via a feshbach resonance located at @xmath58 by changing the s - wave scattering length between @xmath59\\,a_0 $ ] , where @xmath6 denotes the bohr radius .",
    "after the preparation , the fermions are loaded into a tunable - geometry optical lattice within @xmath11 using an s - shaped ramp .",
    "the lattice potential is created by several retro - reflected interfering and non - interfering laser beams of wavelength @xmath12 , which gives access to a broad variety of lattice geometries described by the following potential @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the lattice depths of each single beam in direction @xmath62 given in units of the recoil energy @xmath63 , @xmath64 , visibility @xmath65 and @xmath66 denotes the planck constant .",
    "we set @xmath67 and interferometrically stabilize the phase @xmath68 .",

    "1 is obtained by individually adjusting the lattice depths @xmath61 . following this procedure the",
    "connectivity @xmath32 ( i.e. the number of strong nearest neighbor links ) can be varied from 1 ( dimerized lattice ) to 6 ( cubic lattice ) .",
    "this is achieved by enhancing the tunneling rate of @xmath32 nearest - neighbor lattice bonds , with respect to the remaining @xmath35 bonds per site .",
    "due to the tunability of our optical lattice we can realize the seven individual lattice geometries shown in fig .",
    "1 , as well as the crossover configurations , such as the ones shown in fig .",
    "additionally it allows us to ramp from one lattice geometry to another on a variably time - scale , which is used for the dynamics measurements shown in fig .",
    "3 .    to set the correct lattice depths",
    "we calculate all hubbard parameters numerically from the lattice potential using wannier functions .",
    "our computational method is based on their definition as eigenstates of band - projected position operators @xcite . from the overlap integrals of the wannier functions we obtain the tunneling @xmath15 between nearest neighbors and the interaction energy @xmath17 . for all our measurements ,",
    "we choose the lattice depths in such a way that the total bandwidth of the single orbital tight - binding model is always @xmath70 , independent of the particular lattice geometry .",
    "the expression is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath25 denotes the sum over all 6 nearest neighbors of any given lattice site in the underlying simple cubic lattice .",
    "since the wannier functions depend on the exact geometry and lattice depths , we have to adjust the scattering length by tuning the magnetic field of the feshbach resonance to ensure a constant on - site interaction @xmath72 .",
    "the exact parameters for all the lattice geometries with different connectivities realized in the experiment are summarized in table [ table_lattice_configurations ] .    due to the changing harmonic confinement as a result of the intensity variation of the lattice beams , we have to adjust the optical power of the additional dipole trap to set a constant geometric mean trapping frequency of @xmath13 for all measurements . however , the individual trapping frequencies in @xmath73- , @xmath74- and @xmath75-direction of the harmonic confinement are changing for each lattice geometry .",
    "the detection scheme for nearest - neighbor anti - ferromagnetic spin correlations consists of several steps ( see fig .",
    "[ detection_scheme ] ) and closely follows the procedure used in previous experiments @xcite . after preparing the many - body state in the chosen lattice geometry , we perform a sudden ramp of the lattice depth to freeze out the atomic motion . for this",
    "we always ramp into a deep simple cubic lattice with @xmath76\\,e_r$ ] within @xmath77 independent of the starting geometry of the optical lattice ( i.e. z=1 .. 6 ) . the overall measurement projects the state of the initial lattice onto the singlet @xmath78 and triplet states @xmath79 on the respective set of links where the spin correlations are measured ( see fig .",
    "[ detection_scheme]b ) . from this",
    "we determine the fraction of atoms forming singlets @xmath80 and triplets @xmath81 on neighboring sites .",
    "an imbalance in these two fractions corresponds to magnetic ordering on neighboring sites .",
    "the population imbalance is proportional to the transverse spin correlator @xcite @xmath82 which is measured on every second lattice link with nearest neighbors @xmath25 and @xmath26 and along the transverse spin axis ( see fig . [",
    "detection_scheme]b ) . due to our detection process",
    "all quantities are averaged over the entire atomic cloud . as doubly occupied sites do not contribute to the spin correlator and",
    "hinder the detection process , they are removed in the deep cubic lattice using a series of landau - zener transfers before detecting the singlet and triplet fractions .",
    "we measure the singlet and triplet fractions by subsequently applying a magnetic field gradient , which lifts the energy degeneracy for atoms with opposite spins on neighboring sites .",
    "this induces a coherent oscillation between the singlet and the triplet states .",
    "the singlet - triplet oscillations ( sto ) have a frequency of @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the energy splitting , and are only visible if the initial amount of singlets and triplets is different , as their respective time evolution is exactly out of phase . after a variable oscillation time we remove the magnetic field gradient and merge pairs of adjacent sites into a single site .",
    "we use a @xmath85 linear ramp from the deep cubic lattice into a deep checkerboard lattice ( @xmath86\\,e_r$ ] ) , where tunneling is still suppressed and the number of sites is divided by two . during merging , the @xmath87 and @xmath88 states",
    "are mapped onto different bands due to their distinct symmetry of the two - particle wave function .",
    "the ( spatially symmetric ) singlet state is mapped to two atoms in the lowest band of the final state , while the ( spatially anti - symmetric ) triplet state evolves into a final state with one atom in the first excited band and one atom in the lowest band . by adjusting the oscillation time to a maximum or minimum of the sto we can then detect the fraction of atoms in the singlet and triplet state by measuring the fraction of atoms on doubly occupied sites with both atoms in the lowest band .",
    "this is accomplished using interaction dependent rf - spectroscopy , which transfers the @xmath89 atoms on doubly occupied sites in the lowest band to the initially unpopulated @xmath90 state @xcite .",
    "after all these steps we measure the atomic populations in the different spin states .",
    "we ramp down the optical lattice potential and dipole trap within 20ms and apply a magnetic field gradient to separate the different @xmath91 states in a stern - gerlach measurement during ballistic expansion .",
    "finally we take an absorption image and apply gaussian fits to the density distribution of each spin component to determine the number of atoms in each spin state ( exemplary image shown in fig .",
    "[ detection_scheme ] ) . for the double - occupancy measurement",
    "we take into account the independently calibrated detection efficiency of 91(3)% and the background offset in double occupancy of 2.2% is subtracted ( the latter however does not change the measured value of the spin correlator ) . in addition , we take into account the separately calibrated decay of the singlet - triplet oscillations during the entire detection sequence @xcite .      to test and calibrate the performance of the detection scheme for measuring spin correlations using singlet - triplet oscillations , we prepare an initial state with a large number of singlets and very small number of triplets .",
    "we load an attractive spin - mixture at @xmath92 into a deep checkerboard lattice with @xmath93\\,e_r$ ] , which leads to a large number of doubly occupied sites .",
    "we first freeze this geometry and then ramp to repulsive interactions with @xmath94 . in a second step we split the sites of the checkerboard lattice by ramping to the same deep cubic lattice which is used in the first step of the detection scheme .",
    "this converts the double occupied sites to singlets .",
    "although this initial state may be far from equilibrium owing to its preparation , it is well suited for calibration purposes as it contains a very large imbalance in the singlet and triplet fractions , and hence a large value for the nearest - neighbor spin correlator .",
    "after the initial preparation , we apply the entire detection protocol and measure the double occupancy after merging as a function of oscillation time with magnetic field gradient , see fig .",
    "[ fig_fullsto ] . the fraction of atoms forming singlets ( triplets )",
    "is then given by the maximum ( minimum ) value of the measured double occupancy of the sto , which is obtained from a sinusoidal fit to the data .",
    "we use this measurement to calibrate the magnetic field gradient and determine the singlet - triplet oscillation frequency .",
    "the actual phase of the sto , which originates from residual magnetic gradients , is determined by preparing a thermal many - body state in the dimerized geometry of the measurement sequence .",
    "from this we determine the maximum and minimum oscillation time , which is used for all measurements in the main manuscript .        using the tunable geometry optical lattice we can individually address and adjust the specific tunneling values @xmath15 for all six links connecting one lattice site . to measure the dependence of the correlations on the geometry we enhance the tunneling @xmath34 on @xmath32 nearest neighbor links of the underlying simple cubic lattice with z ranging between 1 and 6 , while the tunneling on the remaining links is set to a much smaller value of @xmath36 .",
    "if all tunneling links are set to the same value then @xmath95 and we realize a simple cubic lattice . table [ table_lattice_configurations ] summarizes the parameters of each of the seven lattice geometries realized for the measurements in fig .",
    "the fraction of singlets and triplets is measured on a set of strong links for each data point , see fig .",

    "( see fig .",
    "1 ) we choose for each geometry to always merge the same strong links . for the 1d chain , square and cubic lattice we independently verified that the signal strength of the spin correlator does not depend on the exact choice of the merged strong link .            in the second set of measurements we explore the crossover between two geometries , either from a square lattice ( @xmath46 ) to 1d chains ( @xmath40 ) , or we start with 1d chains which are then continuously deformed to a dimerized lattice ( @xmath39 ) . in both cases",
    "we vary the connectivity by weakening half of the initially strong links to a value of @xmath96 while increasing the other links to @xmath34 . at the same time",
    "the tunneling of the remaining weak links in the initial lattice geometry @xmath97 is modified accordingly to keep @xmath98 constant . to explain this in more detail we consider the case of the 1d to dimer crossover . here",
    "@xmath99 corresponds to the strong tunneling link @xmath34 and @xmath100 to @xmath96 . during the crossover @xmath99 as one of the two initially strong links in the 1d chain ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 )",
    "is increased , whereas @xmath100 is decreased to a lower value .",
    "thereby the ratio between @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be tuned from 1 to 5 .",
    "subsequently the tunneling links @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( corresponding to @xmath97 ) are increased to keep their ratio with @xmath99 constant .",
    "this procedure allows varying the strong - to - weak tunneling ratio @xmath42 from 1 to 5 , thus allowing for a continuous scan between two geometries . as for the previous measurements we also keep the total bandwidth , the geometric mean trapping frequency and the on - site interaction constant .",
    "each data point corresponds to a series of 25 measurements of the spin correlator after directly loading the fermions into the final lattice geometry . due to the experimental set - up of the tunable optical lattice it is only possible to merge adjacent sites along the @xmath73-direction of the laboratory frame . in order to measure the spin correlations on neighboring sites along the perpendicular direction as shown in fig .",
    "2a , the atoms are loaded into a lattice geometry that is rotated by @xmath103 , which is achieved by exchanging the values for the lattice depths @xmath104 and @xmath105 . by merging along the @xmath73-direction of the laboratory",
    "we then effectively merge along the perpendicular direction of the physical system . due to the rotation of the lattice pattern",
    "the effective trapping frequencies along all directions of the harmonic confinement are different for the two lattice geometries .",
    "however , the local density approximation ( lda ) , which has been shown to be accurate in the temperature regime of our experiment @xcite , entails that only the geometric mean of the trap frequency matters .",
    "this implies that the measured result does not depend on the rotation in the @xmath106-plane at constant geometric mean trapping frequency .    to compare the spin correlations on weak and strong links in the dimerized lattice ( see fig .",
    "2b ) we need to be able to control which of the two sites we merge .",
    "this is achieved by controlling the phase @xmath107 between the @xmath108 and @xmath109 lattice beam . during the time spent in the deep lattice ( when @xmath110 , just before the merging ramp , the phase @xmath107 is shifted by @xmath111 .",
    "this ensures that we can merge two adjacent sites along the previously weak link .",
    "the phase shift is generated by an active feed - forward on the phase lock using the acousto - optical modulator of the lattice beam .      in order to observe dynamics in spin correlations we first ramp into the starting lattice geometry , which is either lattice of 1d chain in the @xmath73-direction ( @xmath40 , with the same configuration as in fig .",
    "1 ) or a dimerized lattice ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous measurements we then , in a second step , change the lattice geometry on a variable time scale @xmath49 before detecting the spin correlations .    in the first measurement shown in fig .",
    "3a we change the 1d lattice with strong tunneling links @xmath34 initially along the @xmath73-direction to a geometry with 1d chains along the perpendicular direction .",
    "this is achieved by linearly ramping the lattice depths within the ramp time @xmath49 from @xmath112\\,e_r$ ] to @xmath113\\,e_r$ ] ( at exactly half of the ramp time the potential is hence in a square lattice geometry with equal tunneling strengths in the @xmath106-plane ) .",
    "the spin correlations are measured in the final geometry , where the strong tunneling links are now along the perpendicular direction .",
    "we do not allow for an additional wait time in the final lattice geometry , but directly ramp to the deep cubic lattice and follow the detection scheme described in the previous section . to keep the time the atoms are exposed to the optical lattice constant , we add a wait time before the change in lattice geometry , such that the sum of the wait time and the lattice ramp time @xmath49 is @xmath114 . to measure correlations along new strong links",
    "we follow the same procedure as described in the section of the geometry scan .    in the second set of measurements shown in fig . 3b",
    "we analyze the dynamics of spin correlations when linearly ramping from a dimerized lattice ( @xmath115\\,e_r$ ] ) into a lattice with 1d chains along the @xmath73-direction ( @xmath112\\,e_r$ ] ) .",
    "we follow the same procedure as before with the only difference that the total time in the shallow lattice is now set to @xmath11 to allow for increased ramp times @xmath49 . to merge on different links ( initially we have weak and strong tunneling links in the dimerized lattice ) we follow the same procedure as described for the data in fig",

    "<S> the spin correlations are measured immediately after the ramp along the two different directions .    the observed dependence of the spin correlations on the total ramp time @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . 3a . </S>",
    "<S> for fast ramps , @xmath50 , the spin correlations remain unchanged , at the values without ramping . here , a non - equilibrium state is formed with several charge and spin excitations , which decay when allowing for an additional wait time after the ramp - thus changing the detected value of spin correlations ( open symbols in plot fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) . on intermediate ramp times , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 , the spin correlations change symmetrically along the two directions . </S>",
    "<S> this timescale is comparable to the underlying tunneling time between @xmath52 and @xmath53 during the ramp . </S>",
    "<S> for very slow ramp times we observe within error bars a @xmath54% transfer of spin correlations from the previously strong to the new strong links . when waiting @xmath11 in this case , the magnetic correlations decrease ( most likely due to underlying heating of the gas ) , but agree with the value when loading directly from the harmonic trap to the final lattice geometry and waiting for the same total time . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are in agreement with a fully adiabatic ramp to an equilibrated final state for the slowest ramp times , as the initial and final lattice geometries are the same with the same density and entropy distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation changes considerably for a ramp with different initial and final lattice geometries . here , we start from a dimerized lattice with a ratio of @xmath48 for adjacent tunneling links and ramp to a 1d geometry without dimerization . </S>",
    "<S> immediately after the lattice ramp we measure the spin correlations on the initially strong and weak links along the 1d direction , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b . as before , for fast ramps the spin correlations can not redistribute and are nearly unchanged as compared to the case without ramp . when adding an additional wait time after the fastest ramp , the spin correlations change , signaling a decay of the created excitations in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is different for intermediate ramp times : while the correlations on the initially strong links decrease very quickly , slower ramp times @xmath55 are necessary for the correlations on the initially weak links to change . </S>",
    "<S> this may originate from the difference in the overall tunneling timescale during the ramp for the two links . </S>",
    "<S> for the slowest ramps , the correlators along the original strong and weak link are identical . with an additional wait time </S>",
    "<S> , they both decay to the same value , again owing to heating . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a final state close to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous measurement , the gap between the ground and excited states closes during the ramp , since the singlet - triplet gap has vanished in the non - dimerized geometry . yet , the observed spin correlation value agrees with a reference when loading directly into the final lattice geometry and holding the remaining time . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , ramp times corresponding to a few tunneling times are already sufficient to reach equilibrium .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed anti - ferromagnetic correlations in a variety of lattice geometries and studied the redistribution of correlations between strong and weak links . </S>",
    "<S> extending our work to lower temperatures will allow addressing open questions on the low - temperature phase diagram of the hubbard model in complex lattice geometries . in combination with recent efforts on creating spin - dependent optical lattices with very low underlying heating @xcite , the anisotropic xxz heisenberg model and the falikov - kimball model </S>",
    "<S> could be realized and studied experimentally with ultracold fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results on quantum spin dynamics demonstrate that ultracold fermions in optical lattices are well suited to study open questions in out - of - equilibrium many - body spin systems , where theoretical methods become extraordinarily difficult @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observed rapid formation timescales of spin correlations offer very promising perspectives for the implementation of sophisticated entropy redistribution schemes based on trap shaping and dynamically changing lattice geometries , which are expected to result in overall lower temperatures @xcite .    </S>",
