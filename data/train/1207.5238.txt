    "since the initial development of qcd in the 1970 s , it has been known that the internal structure of the nucleon is due to the presence of quarks , gluons , and a `` sea '' of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "although the electric charge of the nucleon is due to the valence quarks ( as in the early quark models of gell - mann and zweig ) , in qcd the gluons are critical to quark confinement , generating 98% of the nucleon mass in the process . the results of polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments in the 1980 s and 1990 s indicated that , contrary to theoretical expectations , the spin of the nucleon does not arise from the spins of the quarks .",
    "as a result , the role of the gluons and the quark - antiquark pairs in the static properties of the nucleon became a subject of great interest .",
    "although the gluons are responsible for dramatic effects like confinement and nucleon mass , the effects of the quark - antiquark pairs ( necessarily generated by the gluons in qcd and therefore non - zero ) are more difficult to ascertain .",
    "one can think of this as the qcd analog of the famous lamb shift in atomic physics .",
    "the strange quark - antiquark pairs are of particular interest , since there are no valence strange quarks in the nucleon and any process sensitive to strange quarks would necessarily be related to the  sea \" . in 1988 ,",
    "kaplan and manohar  @xcite proposed the study of study of strange quark - antiquark pairs by measurements of neutral weak current matrix elements , perhaps in neutrino scattering experiments . in 1989 , mckeown  @xcite and beck  @xcite proposed that parity - violating electron scattering offered a very effective method to study these matrix elements , generating significant interest and many new experimental proposals . in the subsequent two decades",
    "a great deal of experimental and theoretical effort resulted in a now rather definitive body of work that , for the first time , substantially constrains the contribution of strange quark - antiquark pairs to the elastic electroweak form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the most direct evidence for the existence of quarks and antiquarks in the nucleon is obtained from deep - inelastic lepton scattering . in this process a high momentum virtual photon interacts with the fundamental charges in the nucleon ( quarks and antiquarks ) . through the study of lepton - proton and lepton - neutron scattering , and using charge symmetry ( with approximate treatment of charge symmetry breaking effects )",
    "one can extract information related to the probability distributions for up , down , and sea quarks .",
    "these distributions , known as parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , are defined as a function of momentum fraction in the nucleon , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , and are denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 for the quark flavors . in addition , the production of like - sign dimuon pairs in deep - inelastic charged - current neutrino scattering provides information on the strange quark distribution .",
    "another important ingredient in the flavor decomposition of the sea quarks is provided by drell - yan experimental data , in which an incident quark ( in the projectile nucleon ) annihilates on an antiquark ( in the target nucleon ) producing a @xmath5 pair .",
    "recent drell - yan data on the proton and deuteron have been combined to indicate a startling excess of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , the evolution of the quark and antiquark pdf s as a function of @xmath7 provides information on the gluon pdf @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] shows the results of the pdf s obtained in a recent global fit to deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan data .",
    "the general features of the pdf s shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] are qualitatively well understood .",
    "the dominance of @xmath9 and @xmath10 at higher @xmath11 indicates the valence nature of these quark flavors ( three valence quarks , each with average @xmath12 ) . the dramatic rise of @xmath8 at low @xmath0",
    "is associated with the `` splitting '' of partons at lower @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath13 .",
    "the sea quarks arise from @xmath14 pair production by gluons via @xmath15 .",
    "thus one can infer that the gluons dominate the dynamics at low @xmath0 and the presence of the sea quarks is a secondary feature of the presence of the large number density of gluons .",
    "however , there is a very interesting and important effect at intermediate @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) where ( due to the drell - yan data discussed above ) one finds a substantial excess of @xmath17 relative to @xmath18 .",
    "clearly the process @xmath19 would produce @xmath20 ( except for small effects due to @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 excess must then be attributed to non - perturbative processes .",
    "for example , the fluctuation of a proton into a neutron and @xmath23 contains a @xmath24 component and there is no symmetric analog process to produce @xmath25 .",
    "( note that @xmath26 produces equal numbers of @xmath25 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "in addition , one would expect that the @xmath27 excess from this process would occur at the value @xmath28 , in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "thus this observed excess of @xmath29 strongly indicates the presence of fluctuations into @xmath30 pairs in the nucleon .",
    "of course , many models of the nucleon ( such as the `` cloudy bag '' models ) include such configurations in an attempt to capture the physics associated with other observables ( such as the anomalous magnetic moments ) .",
    "thus one is naturally led to consider the possible role of similar fluctuations such as @xmath31 .",
    "clearly such configurations will have lower probability than @xmath30 fluctuations due to the higher masses of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but one would certainly expect there to be finite observable effects resulting from them .",
    "such configurations would lead to radially separated distributions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 quarks , due to the tendency of the @xmath33 to occupy larger radial distances from the center of mass of the @xmath36 .",
    "the spatial separation of the @xmath35 and @xmath34 would have several implications :    1 .",
    "@xmath37 contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment , and other electroweak form factors , 2 .",
    "@xmath37 contribution to the nucleon axial charge , affecting the value of @xmath38 associated with the helicity carried by quarks , 3 .",
    "@xmath37 contribution to the mass of the nucleon , 4 .",
    "difference between the pdf s @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the first three of these items are low @xmath7 or static properties of the nucleon .",
    "thus they represent a change in the nucleon static properties analagous to the change in atomic properties ( e.g. the lamb shift ) due to vacuum polarization in qed .",
    "the fourth item is an effect analogous to the @xmath22 excess observed in the drell - yan process . in principle , items 1 . ) and 4 . )",
    "can be established in a model - independent fashion , whereas the items 2 . ) and 3 . )",
    "generally require a model - dependent analysis or assumptions about non - perturbative qcd effects .    at present , although there have been many hints of effects associated with items 2 - 3 . )",
    "there is no unassailable demonstration that the evidence can be due to the strange quark effects . for item 4 . )",
    ", there is only a hint in the latest global pdf fit , mstw08 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sminussbar ] .    for the remainder of this review , we will focus on the theoretical framework , experimental techniques , and experimental results associated with the studies of @xmath37 contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment , and other electroweak form factors ( item 1 . ) above ) .",
    "the elastic scattering of nucleons via the neutral weak current can be described by two vector form factors , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and an axial vector form factor @xmath43 .",
    "these form factors are functions of the invariant momentum transfer @xmath7 . like the electromagnetic interaction ,",
    "the neutral weak interaction with a nucleon involves coupling to the quarks ( and antiquarks ) as the gluons have no electroweak interaction . in general , we can write any of the elastic electroweak form factors in terms of the quark flavors . for example",
    "the electromagnetic form factors are given by @xmath44 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath35 refer to the up , down and strange quarks .",
    "note that we ignore charm and heavier quarks as it has been shown that these can be safely neglected .",
    "the neutral weak form factors may be also written in terms of the individual quark flavor components @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is , in principle , precisely determined from other experiments @xcite although one must consider the renormalization scheme and radiative corrections .    for the vector form factors ,",
    "one often prefers to use the sachs form factors @xmath47 with @xmath48 . in the static limit",
    ", the electromagnetic form factors then reduce to the charge and magnetic moment : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "another useful quantity is the charge radius : @xmath51    assuming isospin symmetry , additional relations among the form factors are obtained using the fact that the transformation of proton to neutron @xmath52 is equivalent to changing @xmath9 to @xmath10 and vice versa @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the proton and neutron axial form factors are then related to the quark components ( defined for the proton ) by @xmath54 one can then isolate the strange axial form factor by @xmath55 in principle , this would be a way to access the matrix element @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the nucleon spin four - vector .",
    "again , in practice one must consider radiative corrections and , for this axial form factor , the contribution of anapole effects as discussed in [ sec : axial ] below .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties associated with these corrections render measurement of the strange contribution @xmath58 problematic in parity violating electron scattering .    for the vector form factors , the use of isospin symmetry yields the important relation @xmath59 which illustrates how measurement of the electromagnetic form factors for the proton and neutron , combined with measurement of the corresponding @xmath60 , can provide access to the strange vector form factors .",
    "in this case , as discussed in [ sec : rcorr ] , the radiative corrections are manageable and parity - violating electron scattering is a very useful tool for studying strange vector form factors . in the static limit , one has the particularly interesting quantity @xmath61 known as the strange magnetic moment . since the net strangeness in the nucleon is zero , one has @xmath62 .",
    "however , the mean squared strangeness radius @xmath63(q^2=0)$ ] is a static property that in general can be non - zero .    over the last 2 decades ,",
    "there have been numerous theoretical papers reporting predictions for strange vector form factors .",
    "most of these papers involve models of nucleon structure which , although well - motivated , involve many uncertainties related to the expected accuracy of the predictions .",
    "a good review of the model calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "many of the models predict values for @xmath64 and the results generally range from @xmath65  n.m .",
    ", with a strong preference for negative values .",
    "the predicted values for @xmath66 also cover a substantial range @xmath67  fm .    in the last few years",
    ", calculations based on input from lattice qcd methods have become available .",
    "the challenge associated with lattice calculations involves the evaluation of so - called `` disconnected '' insertions , where the vector current couples to a quark loop that does not involve the valence quarks .",
    "( since there are no valence strange quarks , these are the amplitudes relevant to strange form factors ) . in one approach @xcite , the baryon octet matrix elements are written with connected and disconnected insertions in separate terms .",
    "linear combinations of the baryon magnetic moments are used , along with the assumption of charge symmetry , to obtain expressions involving the baryon magnetic moments and ratios of amplitudes to be evaluated using lattice calculations .",
    "it is claimed that the ratios are reliably determined from lattice calculations , and this method yields the prediction @xmath68",
    ", with the uncertainty estimated from the lattice statistical precision . a similar approach @xcite",
    "was then used to compute the strange radius @xmath69  @xmath70 , where the uncertainty is predominantly due to the poor experimental information on baryon charge radii .",
    "more recently , a more direct approach @xcite using lattice methods has been employed . using a full qcd calculation using @xmath71 clover fermion configurations the result @xmath72  n.m .",
    "is obtained , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is due to uncertainties in @xmath7 and chiral extrapolations .",
    "this result is in remarkable agreement with the more phenomenological result @xcite .      in order to extract contributions of strange form factors @xmath73 from measurements of electroweak form factors",
    ", one must include the effects of @xmath74 electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "these radiative effects typically arise from @xmath75 `` box '' diagrams or loop effects .",
    "it is common to express these @xmath74 corrections as ratios @xmath76 ( for vector @xmath77 and axial vector @xmath78 ) which are fractions of the corresponding tree - level amplitudes .",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 denote the ratios for vector proton , neutron , and su(3)-singlet amplitudes , respectively . in principle",
    ", their values can be obtained using the standard model predictions for the effective electron - quark couplings @xmath82 given in @xcite .",
    "however , these @xmath82 do not include perturbative qcd contributions , nor coherent strong interaction effects in the radiative corrections associated with elastic scattering from a nucleon .",
    "a recent analysis of these effects has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite and up - dated in ref .",

    "( since this error receives roughly equal contributions from the uncertainty in @xmath89 as determined at the @xmath84-pole and from the @xmath74 @xmath90 box graph corrections , it is not appropriate to quote an uncertainty in @xmath79 alone . ) for the range of @xmath7 associated with the experiments discussed in this review , the @xmath91 have a negligible impact on the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath92 and are taken to be constant .",

    "this axial form factor is the same as @xmath96 as measured in charged current processes [ @xmath97 @xcite .",

    "these quantities are traditionally divided into `` one - quark '' and `` many - quark '' contributions .",
    "the one - quark contributions correspond to renormalization of the effective vector electron - axial vector quark couplings , @xmath109 , and their values can be obtained from the standard model predictions for these couplings given in ref .",
    "the many - quark contributions include the so - called `` anapole '' effects as well as coherent strong interaction contributions to the radiative corrections .",
    "in contrast to the vector corrections , @xmath91 , the _ relative _ importance of many - quark effects in the @xmath110 can be quite pronounced .",
    "the many - quark effects can be addressed using chiral perturbation theory , and a comprehensive analysis of the anapole contributions to @xmath106 and @xmath107 has been carried out to chiral order @xmath111 in ref .",
    "the total axial corrections , up - dated for the present value of the weak mixing angle , are @xmath112",
    "the scattering of an electron from a hadronic target involves the dominant electromagnetic amplitude due to photon exchange @xmath113 and the much smaller ( at low momentum transfer @xmath114 ) neutral weak amplitude due to @xmath84 exchange @xmath115 .",
    "the scattering cross section is related to the squared modulus of the sum of these amplitudes @xmath116 .",

    "the different terms @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 depend upon the neutral weak form factors associated with the electric , magnetic , and axial couplings to the nucleon and so provide access to the strange form factors @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , respectively . at small scattering angles , @xmath141 one finds that @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , so @xmath135 becomes the dominant term . at backward angles @xmath145 , @xmath146 and the asymmetry is dominated by the magnetic and axial asymmetries .",
    "note also that the axial asymmetry is suppressed by the factor @xmath147 , but the actual numerical value is quite sensitive to radiative and anapole effects . as a result ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath148 on @xmath140 is quite small and so one uses @xmath140 as determined from spin - dependent deep inelastic scattering .",
    "thus , in the end , one can treat @xmath148 as a ( linear ) function of the vector strange form factors @xmath138 and @xmath139 .    by evaluating eq .",

    "in the static approximation , one can treat quasielastic scattering from deuterium as simply the sum of scattering from a free proton and a free neutron . in this case the parity violating asymmetry has the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) and @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) are the numerators ( denominators ) in eq .",

    "the contribution of @xmath135 is negligible .",
    "the strange magnetic form factor contribution to @xmath136 is reduced , due to the combination @xmath169 and the small value of the nucleon isoscalar magnetic form factor , relative to the axial term @xmath137 .",
    "thus at backward angles the deuteron asymmetry , when combined with the proton asymmetry , can provide useful information on the isovector part of the weak axial form factor @xmath95 .",
    "again , it is important to include radiative corrections in any quantitative analysis .",
    "in addition , the nuclear effects associated with the binding of the two nucleons in deuterium must also be considered .",
    "the requirement to precisely measure party - violating asymmetries of the scale of a few parts per million ( ppm ) imposes several significant experimental challenges .",
    "high statistical precision demands long running time and high luminosity , implying high beam current and thick targets , as well as a highly - polarized beam .",
    "the beam polarizaton must be well - determined , requiring high - quality beam polarimetry .",
    "backgrounds need to be well - separated from the elastic or quasi - elastic scattering events of interest , and any residual background contributions must be precisely corrected for .",
    "the beam helicity needs to be rapidly flipped ( typically at about 30 hz ) to suppress the effect of slow changes in detector or beam properties . in the ideal case ,",
    "no other beam property should change when the helicity is reversed .",
    "fluctuations in beam properties such as intensity , trajectory , and energy that are correlated with the helicity `` flip '' must be minimized , and the sensitivity of the apparatus to such helicity - correlated changes needs to be determined , so that corrections can be made for the residual fluctuations .",
    "additional slow flips of the beam helicity can then be made to suppress many remaining systematics . in this section",
    "we discuss several aspects of the various approaches adopted to meet these challenges .",
    "+      the need for a highly - polarized , high - current electron beam with exquisite stability under reversal of the helicity dictates that a key component of these experiments is the polarized electron source .",
    "the adopted technology , pioneered at slac in the 1970 s @xcite , is based on the emission of electrons from a gaas photocathode when exposed to circularly - polarized laser light .",
    "beam polarizations of near 40% and currents of up to 100  @xmath170a were obtained using `` bulk '' gaas crystals for the photocathode @xcite .",
    "higher polarization ( at the expense of high beam current ) was subsequently produced using `` strained '' crystals , in which the active layer of the photocathode was a thin ( @xmath171100 nm ) layer of gaas grown on gaasp  @xcite .",
    "the mismatch between the two lattices produced a strain in the gaas , breaking the degeneracy in its energy levels , theoretically allowing up to a 100% polarization  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the adoption of multi - layer `` superlattice '' crystals  @xcite has allowed both high polarization ( 89% ) and high current ( 100  @xmath170a ) @xcite .",
    "high - precision parity - violation experiments impose stringent requirements on the polarized electron beam in order to minimize false asymmetries generated by helicity - correlated variations in beam properties .",
    "this demands careful attention to the optical properties of the incident laser light at the electron source .",
    "the fast helicity reversal of the electron beam is accomplished by reversing the handedness of the laser light using a pockels cell , which is a birefringent crystal whose indices of refraction change with the application of an electric field .",
    "linearly polarized light from the source laser , with polarization at 45@xmath172 to the transmission axes , acquires a phase shift between the components on the slow and fast axes ; by adjusting the voltage one can convert the light to either right or left - handed circular polarization .",
    "imperfections in the pockels cell typically lead to a small residual component of linear polarization , which is different for the two nominal circular polarization states .",
    "the linear components are transported differently by the various optical elements , leading to helicity - correlated intensity variations .",
    "gradients in the birefringence in the cell also generate helicity - correlated changes in the trajectory of the light , leading to electron beam position variations  @xcite , which can also lead to intensity variations , as the quantum efficiency of the photocathode usually varies over its surface .",
    "the adoption of strained gaas photocathodes makes these effects especially acute : the strain introduces an anisotropy in the quantum efficiency of the cathode , making it the dominant source of analyzing power in the system .",
    "various passive and active techniques have been adopted to suppress these helicity - correlated effects .",
    "passive techniques include careful alignment of the laser beam through the pockels cell @xcite , minimization of optically active elements in the laser path , and attention to optimum beam transport in the accelerator , to realize the natural `` adiabatic damping '' of position fluctuations in the acceleration process .",
    "active techniques include feedback based on measurements of the helicity - correlated changes in beam intensity and position in the experimental hall .",
    "figure  [ fig : polsource ] depicts a typical polarized electron source setup , in this case the jefferson lab source as used in recent parity experiments @xcite .",
    "two independent systems have been used to supress the intensity variations .",
    "the first uses adjustment of the voltage signal to the pockels cell - small differences in the voltages for the two helicity states modify the residual linear polarization of the transported light , leading to helicity - correlated intensity variations , which then can be adjusted .",
    "the second system , the ia ( intensity attenuator ) , consists of a second pockels cell and a waveplate ( wp ) , sandwiched between two parallel linear polarizers ( lp ) .",
    "this pockels cell ( pc ) is operated at low helicity - dependent voltages ( to minimize beam - steering effects ) and acts as an electro - optic adjustable shutter .",
    "in either case , helicity - correlated electron beam intensity variations are measured , tyically every few minutes , and a feedback signal is sent to the electron source to null the variations .",
    "both the sample experiment and forward - angle phase of the g0 experiment also used active feedback on helicity - correlated position differences in the beam  @xcite . here a piezoelectric - controlled steering mirror ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : polsource ] ) is used to move the beam in a helicity - controlled manner .",
    "another technique is to use an insertable half - wave plate ( ihwp ) in the optical path , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polsource ] . the ihwp is periodically inserted or removed on a time scale of many hours .",
    "the iwhp rotates the linear polarization state by 90@xmath172 , thereby inverting the sense of the resulting circular polarization with respect to the pockels cell voltage .",
    "this slow `` flip '' should reverse the sign of the measured asymmetry in the hall with respect to the helicity control signal , in the absence of any false asymmetry picked up in the experimental electronics due to the helicity - control signal .",
    "many sources of helicity - correlated beam changes are insensitive to the state of the ihwp , and thus this flip cancels these systematics .    to ensure that there are no false asymmetries in the data due to the helicity - control signal being picked up by the experimental electronics , the fast helicity reversal follows a pseudorandom pattern , and the helicity state reported to the electronics is delayed by several states in the pattern , and only later reconstructed in software .    to illustrate the high suppresion of helicity - correlated beam fluctuations afforded by these techniques , consider the happex - ii measurement .",
    "here the values for these variations , averaged over the entire several month - long run , were 0.4 ppm for intensity , @xmath173 nm for position , @xmath174 nrad for angle and 0.2 ppb for energy .",
    "the sensitivity of the apparatus to these residual fluctuations can be determined either by multi - parameter linear regression of the natural fluctuations , or by taking subsets of the data with individual beam parameters modulated in a controlled manner @xcite .",
    "precision knowledge of the beam polarization is essential for normalizing the measured asymmetries .",
    "various polarimeters have been adopted in these experiments , including those that measure continuously during the experiment , such as transmission @xcite and backscattering @xcite compton polarimeters , and those that are invasive , which can only make periodic measurements of the polarization , such as mott @xcite and moller @xcite polarimeters .",
    "the highest precision reached to date was in the happex - iii measurement , where a combination of moller and backscattering compton devices yielded a precision of 0.75% @xcite .",
    "two approaches have been adopted for the measurement of the parity - violating asymmetry .",
    "the challenge is to accomodate the extremely high rates ( of order 10 to 100 mhz ) of scattered electrons that must be detected in order to achieve the desired statistical precision .",
    "one approach is a counting method , in which custom electronics are used to collect events in scalers ( the g0 experiment ) or energy histograms ( the pva4 experiment ) which are accumulated for a given beam helicity state and then digitized at each helicity transition . in the other approach , the integrating method ( sample and happex experiments ) ,",
    "the analog signal from the detectors is integrated over a given helicity window and the integral is digitized at each helicity change .",
    "challenges in the counting method include accounting for the effects of electronic deadtime and event pileup which can distort the measured asymmetry , as well as the design and cost of the custom electronics . in the integrating method one has to ensure a high degree of linearity of the entire electronics chain in order that helicity - correlated variations in the beam intensity not generate false asymmetries . in neither approach , unlike the usual nuclear physics experiment , can one digitize complete information about individual scattering events , so only limited off - line analysis techniques for dealing with background processes are available .",
    "the program of parity - violating electron scattering experiments reviewed here generally involve the use of targets of hydrogen , deuterium and helium .",
    "the very small asymmetries to be measured imply that it is necessary to achieve high luminosity , so these targets must be cryogenic to achieve sufficient areal density .",
    "the use of cryogenic fluids introduces a new challenge : stability of the target density in the presence of the intense electron beam which causes thermal heating of the fluid .",
    "thermal fluctuations are a potential source of additional noise that can degrade the statistical precision of the asymmetry measurement .",
    "the operating point for a liquid hydrogen target is typically about 19 k , just a few degrees below the boiling point at a nominal pressure of 1 - 2  atm .",
    "thus even with small temperature excursions the liquid remains significantly below the boiling point to minimize thermal fluctations due to the beam .",
    "indeed localized boiling , leading to bubble formation , is a major potential source of target thickness variations that can contribute significantly to statistical noise in the measured asymmetries .",
    "the fluid is generally pumped in a recirculation loop in order to constantly provide fresh liquid within the electron beam profile .",
    "the recirculation loop also contains a heat exchanger where heat is transferred to helium gas as the primary coolant .",
    "an ohmic heater in the loop is used to control the temperature and maintain the operating point by compensating for variations in the beam power .",
    "safety is a major consideration in the design and operation of these targets , as a release of hydrogen gas to the room atmosphere can lead to a dangerous flammable mixture .",
    "detailed descriptions of the sample @xcite , g0 @xcite and pva4 @xcite targets are available in the literature .",
    "one experiment , happex - helium , adopted a high pressure @xmath175he gas target to directly measureme the strange electric form factor @xmath138 .",
    "the target was a 20-cm long cell maintained at a temperature and pressure of 7 k and 13 atm , in which the cryogenic @xmath175he was pumped through the cell in a direction transverse to the beam direction , so as to minimize local beam heating . even without the possibility of bubble formation , beam - induced density fluctuations in the gas were a challenge , but were able to be limited to a few % increase in the statistical noise of the asymmetry measurement .",
    "the sample experiment , performed at the mit - bates linear accelerator center , was primarily focused on the goal of determining the strange magnetic form factor @xmath139 at low momentum transfer @xmath176  gev@xmath177 .",
    "a rather complete description of the experiment and results can be found in @xcite , and we provide a short summary here .",
    "a 200  mev polarized electron beam , typically 40  @xmath170a , was incident on a 40  cm long liquid hydrogen target .",
    "a schematic of the apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleschematic ] .",
    "the scattered electrons were detected in a large solid angle ( @xmath178 sr ) air cerenkov detector , with 10 ellipsoidal mirrors at backward angles @xmath179 , resulting in an average @xmath180 ( gev/@xmath181 . at these kinematics",
    "the axial term is expected to contribute about 20% of the asymmetry .",
    "the hydrogen data set was acquired in 1998 , and the experiment was run with a deuterium target in 1999 to acquire data on the axial form factor .",
    "the initial deuterium result indicated a substantial discrepancy with calculations of the axial form factor , and so further deuterium experiments at lower momentum transfer were performed in 2000 - 2001 .",
    "these experiments , along with a reanalysis of the 1999 deuteron dataset ( with improved accounting of pionic backgrounds ) now provide significant confirmation of the theoretical treatment of the axial form factor .",
    "the polarized electron source utilized bulk gaas , with polarization typically about 35% .",
    "the bates beam was pulsed at 600  hz , and the beam helicity was changed for each pulse .",
    "a preselected random pattern of ten helicity states was generated , and the complement of this set ( with reverse helicity ) followed for the next ten pulses .",
    "the longitudinal spin emerging from the polarized source was pre - rotated by a wien spin rotator before injection into the accelerator so the the @xmath182 magnetic bend into the experimental hall would then provide longitudinal polarization at the target location .",
    "the beam polarization was periodically measured using a mller polarimeter .",
    "each detector signal was integrated over the @xmath183s of the beam pulse and digitized along with the beam charge for that pulse .",
    "the ratio of integrated detector signal to integrated beam charge ( normalized yield ) was then corrected for background , beam polarization , and other systematic beam effects to give the experimental result for the parity - violating asymmetry .    for the sample kinematics ,",
    "the parity - violating asymmetry for elastic scattering on the proton for the incident electron energy of 200  mev can be written as @xmath184 ( the isoscalar component of @xmath95 is computed to be very small @xcite and we have absorbed it into the leading constant term . ) the sample measurement of this asymmetry @xcite is @xmath185 using the value of @xmath186 from @xcite results in the strange magnetic form factor @xmath187 where the first uncertainty is statistical , followed by the estimated experimental systematic uncertainty and the last uncertainty is due to the axial corrections and electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the asymmetry for quasielastic electron scattering deuterium for the sample kinematics and detector acceptance at 200  mev is written @xmath188 where the corrections for deuteron structure and other nuclear effects , including hadronic parity violation , have been included as discussed in @xcite .",
    "one should note that the deuteron asymmetry is more sensitive to the contribution from the isovector axial form factor @xmath189 than the proton asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the updated sample result for the deuterium asymmetry in quasielastic kinematics is @xcite @xmath190    a combined fit of the h and d data , assuming @xmath191 , allows a separation of @xmath139 and @xmath192 and yields @xmath193 which agrees well with the h result ( eq .  [ eq : hresult ] ) and also the theoretical prediction @xcite for @xmath194 .      the happex series of experiments were run in hall a at jefferson lab , and made use of the high resolution spectrometers @xcite to focus elastically scattered particles onto a total absorption shower counter in each focal plane whose signals were integrated over the 33 ms helicity period .",

    "the first generation happex experiment ran in 1998 and 1999 @xcite at a kinematics @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( gev / c)@xmath101 corresponding to the smallest angle and largest energy possible with the hall a hrs spectrometers , which maximized the figure of merit for a first measurement .    in",
    "the 1998 run the experiment used a @xmath197  a beam with @xmath198% polarization produced from a bulk gaas crystal , while in the 1999 run happex - i became the first experiment to use a strained gaas photocathode to measure a parity - violating asymmetry in fixed - target electron scattering .",
    "this improved the figure of merit @xmath199 with @xmath200=70% and @xmath201=35 @xmath170a .",
    "@xcite    during happex - i the hall a compton polarimeter @xcite was commissioned and provided , for the first time , a continuous monitoring of the electron beam polarization with a total relative error from run - to - run of less than 2% .",
    "the compton results were in good agreement with the mller polarimeter in hall a and a mott polarimeter located in the 50 mev region of the accelerator .",
    "the happex - i physics asymmetry was found to be @xmath202 the precision of the result was sufficient to rule out several then - current theoretical estimates of strangeness effects at moderately high @xmath7 where it was thought the effects might have been large @xcite .    using this result , along with the calculated @xmath203 and the known values of the proton and neutron form factors , the experiment determined the linear combination of strange form factors @xmath204 where the first error is the total experimental error ( statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature ) and the second error is the error due to the `` ordinary '' electromagnetic form factors .",
    "one feature of the happex experiments is that they have negligible sensitivity to the axial form factors , whose effect is kinematically suppressed due to the very forward scattering angle .",
    "the second generation happex experiments , happex - ii and happex - helium took data in 2004 and 2005 at a lower @xmath205 gev@xmath101 , by utilizing superconducting septa magnets to allow the hrs to detect elastically scattered electrons at a scattering angle of @xmath206 .",
    "the measurement on the @xmath175he target yielded an asymmetry of @xmath207 which tightly constrained the strange electric form factor to @xmath208 .",
    "the hydrogen data asymmetry @xmath209 determined the form factor combination @xmath210 again , consistent with zero .",
    "subsequently , the happex - iii experiment returned to higher @xmath7 ( 0.62 gev@xmath101 ) with a data - taking run in 2009 .",

    "happex - iii capitalized on advacemements in polarimetery , control of helicity - correlated beam fluctuations , and improved figure of merit compared to happex - i , leading to a precision asymmetry measurement @xmath213 yielding the form factor combination @xmath214 where the third error is due to electromagnetic form factors and radiative corrections .",

    "in the forward angle mode the particle detected was the recoil proton , while in the backward angle mode the particle detected was the scattered electron .",
    "the experiment ran in forward angle mode during the period 2002 - 5 and in backward angle mode during 2006 - 7 .",
    "the g0 experiment employed a large - acceptance superconducting toroidal spectrometer with eight coils and eight sets of particle detectors providing excellent azimuthal symmetry about the beam axis . in forward angle mode ,",

    "the beam current is typically 20 @xmath170a , with a polarization of 80% , and the helicity state is selected every 20 ms .    the first pva4 measurement was in a forward - angle configuration , with a liquid hydrogen target ; the measured asymmetry is sensitive to a linear combination of @xmath216 and @xmath215 .",

    "this later result represents a nearly 2@xmath234 deviation from zero .",
    "after these two forward - angle measurements , the pva4 apparatus was turned around and modified for a series of backward - angle measurements . added to the detector was a double - ring of 72 scintillator counters , each of which cover 14 of the pbf@xmath235 detectors .",

    "during the last decade there has been a substantial international effort to perform measurements of parity - violating asymmetries in elastic electron scattering from nucleons .",

    "substantial theoretical effort has provided confidence in the radiative corrections and the degree of uncertainty associated with contributions to the axial form factor @xmath95 . as a result , we now have a rather clear picture that has emerged from this body of work .    in general",
    ", a convincing signal for a significant strange quark - antiquark effect in the vector form factors has not been obtained from these measurements .",
    "the various experimental results at different kinematics all seem to support this general conclusion .",
    "in fact , the results are remarkably consistent with this conclusion despite the difficulty of these very challenging experiments .    at the lowest momentum transfers ( @xmath205  ( gev / c)@xmath177 , there have been global fits performed to the body of experimental data in this kinematic region @xcite .",
    "these fits illustrate the consistency of the data and reinforce the conclusion that the strange vector form factors are quite small ( compared to many model predictions ) at this low @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig : liu ] shows the result of the most recent of these global fits @xcite . as a result",
    ", one can now conclude that , with 95% confidence , strange quarks contribute less than 5% of the mean - square charge radius and less than 6% of the magnetic moment of the proton .",
    "it is fair to say that these results are rather surprising in light of the guidance from many models of nucleon structure that predicted substantial strange quark effects at low @xmath7 .",
    "the result also seems to be at variance with the notion that baryon - meson fluctations are a significant aspect of nucleon structure as one would infer from the @xmath240 asymmetry observed in drell - yan production and the success of many meson cloud models of the nucleon .",
    "more recently , there have been results based on lattice qcd calculations @xcite that seem to support the very small values of the strange form factors indicated by the experiments .",
    "it is certainly gratifying that these calculations are consistent with experiment .",
    "nevertheless , they do not provide much insight as to _ why _ the strange quark contributions are suppressed in these quantities . in the end , one has to admit that we have certainly learned something quite significant about nucleon structure from this program but that a deeper understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking .    on the practical side , the conclusion that strange form factors are constrained to be small combined with the development of the experimental techniques for parity - violating electron scattering experiments has motivated new experiments to perform precision tests of the standard electroweak model in parity - violating electron scattering . in particular , the experimental program reviewed here , and the constraint on the strange electric form factor of the proton @xmath138 , provides a quantitative basis for assessing the utility of low @xmath7 measurements of parity - violating electron scattering to provide precise new information on the running of the weak mixing angle @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "for example , the qweak experiment at jefferson lab @xcite is presently underway and expects to provide a measurement of @xmath241 to about 0.24% precision .",
