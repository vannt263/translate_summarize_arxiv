    "<S> note that this transition is analogous to that observed in @xcite . ]    even though cavity - qed output states are of cmps type , can a realistic system in the presence of decoherence reproduce the relevant physics of a strongly interacting quantum field ? as a test case , we demonstrate that the paradigmatic cavity - qed system , comprising a single trapped atom coupled to a high - finesse cavity mode , is capable of simulating the ground - state physics of an equally paradigmatic field , namely , the lieb - liniger model  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this procedure is repeated over a range of @xmath55 values of interest , and the corresponding optimized values of @xmath12 are then used to compute quantities of interest , e.g. , spatial - correlation functions as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pilot_study ] . remarkably , we find that just these three variational parameters @xmath66 , when varied in the experimentally feasible parameter regime of @xcite in the presence of losses , allow for a quantum simulation of lieb - liniger ground - state physics . </S>",
    "<S> one expects that the ground - state approximation would improve by increasing the dimension of the auxiliary system and by allowing sufficiently general internal couplings and couplings to the field . in the context of atom - cavity systems , this can be done by making use of the rich level structure of atoms ( i.e. , zeeman splittings ) and making use of motional degrees of freedom . for sufficiently complex intracavity dynamics </S>",
    "<S> a classical simulation will become unfeasible , and at the same time it becomes conceivable that such a simulator will outperform the best classical methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of a quantum simulator can be compromised by decoherence effects , as was recently emphasized in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation of the ion - cavity system includes both cavity decay ( at rate @xmath67 ) and decay of the ion due to spontaneous emission ( at rate @xmath68 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity decay rate rescales the parameter @xmath16 linking measurement time and simulated space , and thus it can be considered as a variational parameter itself . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that cavity decay does not function as a decoherence channel in our scheme but is rather an essential element of the cmps formalism . in contrast , spontaneous emission sets the limit for the timescale over which coherent dynamics can be observed . for our present example , we can show that the regime of strong cooperativity @xmath69 is sufficient to allow a simulation of the lieb - liniger model despite detrimental losses . </S>",
    "<S> the lieb - liniger model exhibits nontrivial variations ( friedel oscillations ) of the two - point correlation function on a length scale @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this length scale in the simulated model translates to a time scale over which the stationary output field ( as the simulating register ) should exhibit similar nontrivial features . from </S>",
    "<S> the previously established scaling rule one finds that the required time scale is @xmath71 . by means of the cavity input - output relations , </S>",
    "<S> we relate the output photon flux to the mean intracavity photon number @xmath72 . in the bad cavity limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 the cavity mode can be adiabatically eliminated . in this case @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 . on the other hand , the characteristic decoherence time of the ion is determined by the spontaneous emission rate @xmath76 . beyond a time @xmath77 the second order correlation function @xmath64 will be trivial . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore demand @xmath78 , which is equivalent to the requirement of a large cooperativity @xmath79 . for the exemplary case of the ion - cavity system considered above the cooperativity </S>",
    "<S> was indeed @xmath80 , see supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> while equivalent conditions must be determined on a case - to - case basis , we expect that nontrivial quantum simulations in cavity qed will not be possible in the weak - coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> . finally , there are overall losses associated with scattering and absorption in cavity mirrors , detection path optics , and photon - counter efficiency . however , while these losses reduce the efficiency with which photon correlations are detected , they do not otherwise affect the system dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is when our scheme would provide a practical advantage over classical computers in the simulation of quantum fields . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this to be the case in particular for the simulation of fields with multiple components , or species of particles , with canonical field - annihilation operators @xmath81 , @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation arises in at least two settings : firstly , for vector bosons in gauge theories with gauge group @xmath83 , and secondly , in the nonrelativistic setting of cold atomic gases with multiple species . </S>",
    "<S> variational calculations using cmps fail in these settings , as the number of variational parameters must scale as @xmath84 . on the other hand , in a cavity - qed quantum simulation </S>",
    "<S> multiple output fields are naturally accessible via polarization or higher order cavity modes , and at the same time large effective hilbert space dimensions can be achieved , e.g. , with trapped ions or atoms . with @xmath85 , </S>",
    "<S> substantial practical speedups are already expected with respect to the classical cmps algorithm , which requires a number of operations scaling as @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> the realisation that ground - state cmps and the field states emerging from a cavity are connected can be exploited to characterise the correlations of the emitted light . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we obtain a simple criteria to determine when the correlations in the light field are nonclassical : if it turns out that the simulated hamiltonian is quadratic in the field operators ; and ( b ) contains only `` ultralocal '' terms , i.e. , no derivatives in the field operators , then the ground state is a trivial ( i.e. , gaussian ) product state , and there would be no nonclassical correlations in the emitted light .    </S>",
    "<S> the output of a cavity - qed apparatus admits a natural interpretation as a variational class of quantum - field states . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that this allows an _ analogue _ quantum simulation procedure for strongly correlated physics using current technology . </S>",
    "<S> this result opens up an entirely new perspective for all cavity - qed systems which exhibit sufficiently strong nonlinearities at the single - photon level . </S>",
    "<S> this includes not only optical cavities coupled to atoms , but also superconducting circuits with super - strong coupling to solid state quantum systems  @xcite , as well as other nonlinear systems achieving a high optical depth without cavities , such as atomic ensembles exhibiting rydberg blockade @xcite , or coupled to nanophotonic waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> looking further afield , since the input - output and cmps formalisms generalize in a natural way to fermionic settings  @xcite , our simulation procedure might be applicable to cavity - like microelectronic settings involving fermionic degrees of freedom . </S>",
