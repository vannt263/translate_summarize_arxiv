    "thus , the slope of @xmath2-@xmath5 relation is stable and not sensitive to the temperature definition .",
    "the right panel in fig.[zhaohh : fig7 ] shows a histogram of the log space residuals from the @xmath6-@xmath9 relation for all clusters .",
    "this raw scatter in @xmath6 is well described by a gaussian fit in log space with @xmath154 = 0.13 , which is the smallest among the relation between the observables and the total mass .",
    "we also obtain a small intrinsic scatter of 0.13 dex .",
    "fixing the slope to 0.62 , we find that the normalization of our relation is lower than that in zhang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) by @xmath155 .",
    "we also fix the slope to 0.57 , and find that the normalization of our slope is similar with the simulation value by @xmath156 .",
    "the slope for the relation of the ncccs agrees with that for the cccs within errors as listed in table 4 .",
    "both slopes are close to the self - similar prediction ( 0.6 ) .",
    "taking the errors into account , the normalization for the ncccs is also consistent with that for the cccs .",
    "in this section , we compare the four mass scaling relations ( @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath3 , @xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath2-@xmath5 ) , to find out which relation is the best to estimate cluster mass .",
    "the comparison of these relations are listed in table 5 .",
    "the slope of the @xmath1-@xmath2 relation ( @xmath140 ) is steeper than the self - similar expectation ( 1.33 ) significantly",
    ". it may be due to that the @xmath1 is dominated by cluster center and thus particularly susceptible to nongravitational processes , while the self - similarity is roughly preserved in the outer region . for the @xmath6-@xmath3 relation",
    ", we perform the fittings for both the hot clusters ( @xmath157 kev ) and the whole sample , and find that the slopes are steeper than the self - similar value and do not vary with the cluster temperature range .",
    "the slope of the @xmath2-@xmath4 relation is shallower than the self - similar prediction , moreover , the gas fraction seems to depend on the @xmath2 rather than a constant .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath5 relation agrees with the self - similarity and is consistent with the simulations @xcite .",
    "both intrinsic scatters and raw scatters show that the @xmath2-@xmath5 relation is the tightest one compared with the @xmath2-@xmath3 , @xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath1-@xmath2 relations .",
    "numerical simulations also indicate that the @xmath5 is a low - scatter mass proxy ( with only @xmath23 5%-8% intrinsic scatter ) @xcite , which is smaller than any other mass proxies even in the presence of significant dynamical activity .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 relation has the largest discrepancy in the slopes between cccs ( @xmath146 ) and ncccs ( @xmath145 ) , indicating a significant influence of the cool core on this relation .",
    "the slope for the ncccs is consistent with the self - similar expected , while the slope for the cccs is steeper ( table 3 ) .",
    "in contrast , the slopes of the other relations display much smaller differences between cccs and ncccs .",
    "that indicates the cool core has little influence on the @xmath2-@xmath3,@xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath2-@xmath5 relations .",
    "many large cluster samples have been used to investigate the scaling relations .",
    "we compare recent results in table 6 . both simulations ( nagai et al .",
    "2007 , fabjan et al . 2011 ) and observations ( arnaud et al . 2007 , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2009 , li et al .",
    "2013 ) show that the relation of @xmath2-@xmath5 is in good agreement with the self - similar expected value , 0.6 , and does not change with cluster sample , while the other relations are quite different between samples .",
    "compared to the other relations , the @xmath2-@xmath5 relation is the most insensitive to variations in the physical processes included in the simulation @xcite .    in sum , the @xmath2-@xmath5 relation is the stablest one among these four scaling relations , which is in agreement with the self - similar model and does not changes with the cluster sample .",
    "in addition , this relation has the smallest scatter in @xmath2 and does not affected by the cool core .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath5 is the best proxy to estimate cluster mass .      for x - ray flux - limited cluster samples ,",
    "more luminous clusters will be selected from a survey volume and this will induce the malmquist bias .",
    "many works have pointed out that the observed @xmath27-@xmath10 scaling relation may be significantly affected by malmquist bias if the scatter in luminosity for fixed mass is large @xcite .",
    "we can give the mean bias in @xmath158 for given mass @xcite : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the mean @xmath161 for given mass , and @xmath162 has a log - normal distribution ( @xmath163 ) , which characterizes the scatter of @xmath161 in the @xmath27-@xmath10 relation .",
    "for the low redshift and flux - limited sample , the evolution on the @xmath27-@xmath10 relation can be neglected within the survey s effective redshift depth @xcite , and the survey volume is a power law function of the object luminosity ( @xmath164 in euclidean space ) .",
    "thus , the eq .",
    "( 11 ) can be worked out analytically with @xmath165=@xmath166 .",
    "we also perform a gaussian fitting for the @xmath167-@xmath6 relation and find @xmath49=0.65 , the bias is 0.63 .",
    "thus , the malmquist bias leads to a @xmath168 overestimation in the normalization of the observed @xmath167-@xmath6 relation in our sample , which is much smaller than the factor of  2 bias advocated by stanek et al . ( 2006 ) but larger than the value 26% in vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the total cluster mass may be affected by some factors .",
    "first , the assumption of spherical symmetry is not satisfied in some clusters , thus , the masses of these clusters may be overestimated ( or underestimated ) . to estimate the uncertainty due to spherical symmetry , landry et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found a @xmath169 systematic uncertainty in the total mass of the most disturbed clusters , a520 , at @xmath85 .",
    "all the clusters in our sample are regular and round in projected image , but in case of merging along the line - of - sight , the inaccuracy may be large due to the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "second , all the clusters in our sample are nearby , at redshift @xmath170 .",
    "the temperature profiles to @xmath85 are unavailable for some clusters . in this case , we use the extended temperature profile to calculate the cluster mass , which will introduce some errors .",
    "we select a nccc ( a3391 ) and a ccc ( a1650 ) , whose temperatures at @xmath85 are available , to test the uncertainties due to the possibility of mis - extrapolating the temperature profile .",
    "we fit the temperature profiles without the outmost observed data , and then obtain their cluster masses again . compared with the previous masses , the biases in the cluster mass due to the mis - extrapolating temperature profiles for a1650 and a3391",
    "are  17% and  4% , respectively .",
    "third , the hydrostatic equilibrium may be destroyed and non - thermal pressure components become more significant at large radius @xcite . the subsonic turbulent motions of the icm gas in relaxed clusters in the nagai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample seem to result in a @xmath52 15% underestimate in the hydrostatic estimates of @xmath2 .",
    "using a sample of 39 x - ray nearby ( @xmath0 ) galaxy clusters observed with _ xmm - newton _ , we investigate the relations between x - ray observables and total mass .",
    "the observable parameters ( e.g. @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) are precisely derived by de - projecting technique . with the criterion of the central cooling time and the central temperature ,",
    "we divide the clusters in this sample into ncccs and cccs and the fractions are 36% and 64% , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we study the scaling relations of @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath3 , @xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath2-@xmath5 , and also the influences of cool core on these relations .",
    "the results show that the @xmath6-@xmath5 relation has a slope close to the standard self - similar value , has the smallest scatter and does not vary with the cluster sample .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2-@xmath5 relation is not affected by the cool core .",
