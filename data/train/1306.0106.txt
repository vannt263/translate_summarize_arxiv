    "the rhic beam energy scan program was launched in 2010 to study the features of the qcd phase diagram . in particular ,",
    "the goal is to search for signs of the possible 1st - order phase transition between the confined and deconfined matter , and locate the critical point marking the boundary of cross - over and 1st - order phase transition in the plane of baryochemical potential @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 @xcite , predicted by lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow is one of the key observables that supports the finding of a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma at the highest energies of rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "therefore , one would naively expect the elliptic flow to decrease at lower beam energies where the hydrodynamic phase gets shortened or the qgp is not created at all .",
    "it has been found , however , that the inclusive charged hadron elliptic flow @xmath2 demonstrates very little dependence on the collision energy between @xmath3 gev @xcite .",
    "the beam energy dependence of the collective flow has been recently studied with several different models @xcite .",
    "one possible method for investigating the importance of the hydrodynamical evolution for the flow production is the hybrid approach , where a transport model ( a microscopic description of the system ) is utilized for the non - equilibrium phases at the beginning and the end of a heavy - ion collision event , and a ( macroscopic ) hydrodynamical description is used to model the hot and dense stage and the phase transition between the qgp and hadronic matter .",
    "as such a hybrid model should be able to naturally produce the transition from the high - energy heavy ion collisions , with negligible net - baryon density and a large hydrodynamically evolving medium , to smaller energies with finite net - baryon density and lower temperatures , where no such medium is formed , this framework seems optimal for studying the beam energy dependence of the elliptic and triangular flow .",
    "this study was performed using a transport + hydrodynamics hybrid model described in @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the initial state is produced by the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) string / hadronic cascade @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution starts , when the two colliding nuclei have passed through each other : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents the nuclear radius and @xmath6 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the minimum time of 0.5 fm is chosen based on the hybrid model results at the collision energy @xmath7 gev @xcite . at this time ,",
    "the energy- , momentum- and baryon number densities of the particles , represented by 3d gaussian distributions that are lorentz - contracted in the beam direction , are mapped onto the hydro grid .",
    "the width parameter of these gaussians is @xmath8 fm , to preserve the event - by - event initial state fluctuations .",
    "spectators do not participate on the hydrodynamical evolution , but are propagated separately in the cascade .",
    "the model utilizes ( 3 + 1)-d ideal hydrodynamics , solving the evolution equations using the shasta algorithm @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is based on a chiral model , coupled to polyakov loop to include the deconfinement phase transition @xcite , which qualitatively agrees with the lattice qcd data at @xmath9 and is also applicable at finite baryon densities .",
    "after the last step of the hydrodynamical evolution , the active eos is changed from the deconfinement eos to the hadron gas eos , to ensure that the active degrees of freedom on both sides of the transition hypersurface are exactly equivalent @xcite .    the transition from hydro to transport ( `` particlization '' )",
    "is done when the energy density @xmath10 is smaller than the critical value @xmath11 , where @xmath12 mev/@xmath13 represents the nuclear ground state energy density .",
    "this corresponds roughly to a switching temperature @xmath14 mev at @xmath7 gev au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "the switching criterion with respect to the energy density is kept constant over all beam energies in this study , but naturally corresponds to different combinations of temperature and baryochemical potential at different values of @xmath15 .    from the iso - energy density hypersurface ,",
    "constructed using the cornelius algorithm @xcite , particle distributions are generated according to the cooper - frye formula .",
    "after the particlization , rescatterings and final decays are computed in the urqmd . the end result is a distribution of particles which can be directly compared against the experimental data .",
    "this hybrid approach has the advantage of dynamically changing the importance of the non - equilibrium transport and the hydrodynamic part of the evolution and involves a proper equation of state that is applicable at high net baryon densities .",
    "the high viscosity during the hadron gas evolution is taken into account , while the small viscosity during the hydrodynamic evolution has been neglected for simplicity to demonstrate qualitative behavior .",
    "before going into more detailed observables such as the elliptic flow , we check how well the hybrid model reproduces the more general features of the system , such as the particle spectra .",
    "the evolution of @xmath16 spectra at midrapidity @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 as a function of beam energy in pb+pb -collisions is illustrated in figure  [ figure_mt_spectra ] .",
    "for the beam energy @xmath20 agev , corresponding to the collision energy @xmath21 gev , there is a good agreement with the na49 data @xcite .",
    "however , at the higher energies it becomes clear that the pion slope is a little too flat and there is an excess of kaons produced .",
    "this necessitates revisiting the model parameters , chiefly the value of particlization energy density , in the future studies .",
    "nevertheless , for the purpose of the current investigation the agreement with the experimental data is sufficient .     for @xmath18 and @xmath19 in pb+pb -collisions ,",

    "this and the new implementation of the cooper - frye hypersurface finder and particlization are the main differences in this calculation compared to previous studies of elliptic flow in the same hybrid approach @xcite .",
