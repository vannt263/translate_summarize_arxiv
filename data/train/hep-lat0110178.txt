    "in the calculation of inclusive decay rates of the heavy hadron , the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) technique is widely used . at the order @xmath2 of hqe two nonperturbative parameters @xmath3 appear in the calculation .",
    "@xmath4 represents a heavy - light meson or heavy - light - light baryon ( for @xmath5 hadrons , @xmath6 = @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . for instance , the lifetime ratio of @xmath5 hadrons is given as @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 1.2 . while @xmath1 may be evaluated from experimental values of hyperfine splitting , the determination of @xmath14 requires some theoretical inputs .",
    "it should be noted that the parameters are defined in the static limit : @xmath15 . for heavy - light meson",
    ", @xmath16 has been calculated using the lattice version of the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .    in this work",
    "we calculate @xmath14 and @xmath1 on the lattice using the nrqcd action for heavy quark .",
    "although the individual matrix element suffers from large perturbative uncertainty due to power divergence in the matching calculation , their differences like @xmath17 are free from the uncertainty of the operator .",
    "we calculate both @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and compare them with the corresponding predictions for mass splittings .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be indirectly obtained from hadron masses , using @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the residual energy difference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 surviving in the infinite heavy quark limit . @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 appear in the correction terms of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , by considering proper mass differences , certain combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be extracted .",
    "for example , a difference of @xmath1 can be obtained from the mass splitting in a spin multiplet , because @xmath20 and @xmath0 have the same value . also ,",
    "the spin averaged mass @xmath24 does not depend on @xmath1 , because @xmath1 is proportional to the spin of the light degrees of the freedom and the sum of @xmath1 in the spin multiplet vanishes .",
    "[ fig : hqdep.hfsm2.g.k0 ]",
    "we carry out quenched qcd simulations at @xmath25=6.0 on a @xmath26 lattice . the nrqcd action including all @xmath23 terms and the non - perturbatively improved clover action ( @xmath27=1.769 ) is adapted for heavy quark and light quark , respectively .",
    "five heavy quark masses @xmath28=1.3 , 2.1 , 3.0 , 5.0 , and 10.0 are used to study the @xmath29 dependence of hadron masses and matrix elements , while three hopping parameters @xmath30=0.13331 , 0.13384 , and 0.13432 are simulated to extrapolate to the chiral limit @xmath31=0.135284(8 ) .",
    "the inverse lattice spacing @xmath32=1.85(5 ) gev is determined with the @xmath33 meson mass @xmath34=770 mev .",
    "we measure the three - point functions @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an interpolating field to create or annihilate the hadron @xmath4 , and @xmath37 is the operator to be measured , @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "we divide them by @xmath40 to obtain the desired matrix elements @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "from ( [ eq : mass_formula ] ) the hyperfine splitting @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 , or equivalently @xmath43 at the leading order . in figure  [ fig : hqdep.hfsm2.g.k0 ] , we plot our results for @xmath44 together with the measurement of @xmath45 .",
    "we observe that the relation ( [ eq : hfsm2 ] ) is satisfied very well , while both are significantly lower than the experimental values for @xmath7 and @xmath46 mesons .",
    "in deriving ( [ eq : hfsm2 ] ) we used a relation @xmath47 which holds in the static limit .",
    "however , for the nrqcd action including the spin - magnetic interaction term at @xmath23 , the operator @xmath48 mixes with @xmath49 at order @xmath50 .",
    "this is the reason why our result for @xmath44 deviates from that of the mass difference in the lighter heavy quark mass region . in other words ,",
    "the relation ( [ eq : diffm ] ) may be considered as a renormalization condition for the operator @xmath48 .",

    "our result is slightly larger than the experimental values for @xmath5 and @xmath57 hadrons .",
