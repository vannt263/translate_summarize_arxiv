    "the resistance of a finite 1d wire should therefore increase exponentially with the wire length .",
    "in fact , the resistance wildly fluctuates from wire to wire in an ensemble of macroscopically identical wires ( because disorder in each wire is microscopically different ) and what increases exponentially is the average resistance .",

    "@xcite    how are these localization effects modified by many - body interactions ? as discussed below , this is an open question especially for a single - channel 1d wire .",
    "authors of ref .   considered tunneling of the interacting 1d electron gas through a single impurity and examined how the many - body interaction renormalizes single - particle tunneling .",
    "they found at zero temperature , that the 1d electron at the fermi level is perfectly reflected by friedel oscillations of the hartree - fock many - electron potential around the impurity .",
    "thus , the impurity is impenetrable and the zero temperature conductance is zero .",
    "however , for such perfect reflection an infinitely long tail of friedel oscillations is needed .",
    "therefore , a single impurity in the wire of finite length still exhibits a nonzero ( albeit reduced ) penetrability .",
    "@xcite many impurities distributed at random along the finite - length wire can thus be expected to cause a similar ( exponential ) localization as in the case of non - interacting gas .",
    "so far we have discussed coherent transport . indeed , localization and",
    "friedel oscillations are due to the interference of incident and reflected electron waves , for which electron coherence is needed . however , the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction in general causes also the phase - breaking e - e collisions and thus acts against interference .",
    "recent theories of the e - e interaction mediated phase breaking @xcite are applicable to a quasi-1d ( multi - channel ) wire , not to the 1d quantum wire with a single conducting channel .",
    "the same can be said about experiments @xcite in which the phase breaking is detected from magnetotransport in weakly localized regime .",

    "obviously , the phase breaking is not identified in this approach as the interference ( exponential localization ) still exists .",
    "the phase breaking which destroys exponential localization can perhaps arise in the analysis involving many interacting 1d particles : the many - particle interaction redistributes energy in a clean 1d electron system , @xcite so perhaps this inelastic process persists also in a disordered 1d system .    such many - particle analysis is a formidable problem , but a few interesting questions can be addressed within a simple phenomenological model developed in this work . in particular , as already mentioned , coherent transport in a weakly disordered 1d wire is described by the dmpk equation , @xcite which determines the distribution of resistances in the ensemble of macroscopically identical wires ( eq .",

    "we examine transport in a disordered 1d wire with a single conducting channel , specifically in the ground subband of a gaas quantum wire .",
    "our model is in essence a simple phenomenological model of the e - e interaction mediated phase breaking , with the electron coherence length treated as a parameter . in the model the phase - breaking collisions effectively break the wire into independent segments , where each segment is a series resistor with coherent electron motion .",
    "we model the segmentation as a stochastic process with a poisson distribution of phase - breaking scattering times and evaluate the resistance of each segment microscopically from the landauer formula .",

    "an electron will move coherently with a certain energy for a while , suffer an inelastic collision which will transfer it to another energy , move coherently with the new energy , suffer another inelastic collision and so on .",
    "thus , electron motion across disorder is no longer elastic and the final states after inelastic collisions are in general affected by the blocking effect of pauli principle . in this situation",
    "the applicability of the landauer expression  ( [ e1 ] ) is questionable .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    ", expression  ( [ e1 ] ) is still applicable if one assumes that there is no net `` vertical '' flow of electrons : every electron that scatters out of its energy @xmath111 into another energy @xmath112 is balanced by another electron that scatters out of @xmath112 into @xmath111 .",
    "this effectively means that an electron with a given energy moves coherently for a while , suffers a phase - breaking collision , continues to move coherently with the same energy , suffers another phase - breaking collision and so on . this `` effective '' electron feels the phase - breaking collisions like elastic events and the effect of pauli blocking disappears .",
    "transport thus still proceeds via independent energy channels and can be described in terms of the transmission and reflection as does equation  ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "however , the transmission of electrons from one contact to the other is now characterised by repeated phase breaking rather than by a single coherent process .    to account for the repeated phase breaking in a simple way we further assume that each phase - breaking collision randomizes the electron phase completely . @xcite in such case it is expected @xcite and can be shown rigorously , @xcite that the phase - breaking events break the wire into segments where each segment is an independent series resistor with coherent electronic resistance .",
    "the resistance of each segment can thus be evaluated from the landauer resistance formula and the resistance of the wire is simply a sum of the resistances of all segments .",
    "we recall that our model relies on the assumption that there is no net `` vertical '' flow .",
    "this assumption is exact for the e - e interaction . indeed ,",
    "if only the e - e interaction is operative , then there is no energy exchange between the electrons and crystal lattice , so any non - zero `` vertical '' flow would distort the electron energy distribution .",
    "in fact the e - e interaction maintains a thermalised distribution , @xcite i.e. , there is no such distortion .",
    "moreover , the e - e interaction conserves the total momentum of the 1d gas and does not cause any momentum - relaxation related resistance .",
