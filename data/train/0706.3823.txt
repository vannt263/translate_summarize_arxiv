    "understanding the dynamics of cosmological models is one of the main goals of theoretical cosmology .",
    "it is generally conceded that the analysis of generic cosmological models ( which are space - times without symmetries ) is exceedingly difficult ; in fact , at present a mathematically rigorous treatment seems to be out of reach .",
    "nevertheless , heuristic and numerical studies that have been performed over the years have resulted in the formulation of a number of conjectures on the asymptotic dynamics of generic cosmologies , see  @xcite and references therein . in particular",
    ", it is conjectured that the generic singularity is intimately connected with ( in fact , actually built on ) the dynamics of spatially homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "spatially homogeneous cosmological models have been analyzed intensively over the years , so that both the asymptotics toward the initial singularity and the asymptotics in the regime of infinite expansion ( with infinitely diluted matter ) are well understood ; see  @xcite for a review .",
    "most of the results concern solutions of the einstein equations coupled to a perfect fluid which is usually assumed to obey a linear equation of state . however , it is unclear in general , how robust these results are under a change of the matter model .",
    "for example , it was shown in  @xcite that the structure of the initial singularity for collisionless matter is considerably different from that of a perfect fluid already for models of bianchi type  i. it is assumed that such different behavior stems from the anisotropic character of the stress - energy tensor  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the global dynamics of spatially homogeneous solutions of bianchi type  i with anisotropic _",
    "elastic matter_. elastic matter is described by the general relativistic theory of elasticity that was formulated by carter / quintana in  @xcite and further elaborated by kijowski / magli  @xcite , beig / schmidt  @xcite and karlovini / samuelsson  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "for very recent work on the static einstein - elastic matter equations see  @xcite .",
    "our choice of matter model is motivated by the fact that elasticity theory offers a natural way of generalizing perfect fluids to a class of anisotropic phenomenological matter models without the need to resort to _ ad hoc _ assumptions on the expression of the anisotropic pressures .",
    "we consider elastic matter with a simple constitutive equation ( lagrangian ) that leads to a stress - energy tensor of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the stress - energy tensor of a perfect fluid with linear equation of state and @xmath2 is a constant which modulates the contribution of the anisotropic stress tensor @xmath3 .",
    "the main results of the paper are the following : toward the future we observe isotropization of models .",
    "all solutions resemble infinitely diluted perfect fluid solutions in the asymptotic regime , which is in accord with physical intuition . toward the initial singularity",
    "the behavior of bianchi type i models with elastic matter is significantly different from the behavior of perfect fluid models .",
    "we prove that the behavior toward the singularity is _",
    "oscillatory_. in particular , there does not exist any solution that converges to a kasner solution ( vacuum solution ) . in the lrs case solutions",
    "oscillate between two different kasner states ( the taub solution and the non - flat lrs solution ) ; in the general case , the solution undergoes a ( probably infinite ) sequence of kasner states ( vacuum states ) as the singularity is approached .",
    "this behavior is intimately connected with energy condition violation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ elasticspacetimes ]",
    "we briefly outline the derivation of the stress - energy tensor for elastic matter and introduce the class of diagonal bianchi type  i solutions of the einstein equations which will be the subject of our analysis . in section [ dynamicalsystem ]",
    "we reformulate the einstein equations with elastic matter for diagonal bianchi type  i solutions as a reduced dimensionless dynamical system on a compact state space .",
    "section  [ globaldyn ] contains the basic qualitative results on the global dynamics of solutions . in section  [ lrssolutions ]",
    "we specialize to the lrs ( locally rotationally symmetric ) case ; the reduced number of degrees of freedom permits a comprehensive analysis of the past attractor . in section  [ antilrssolutions ]",
    "we discuss another ( non - generic ) subclass of solutions ( `` anti - lrs solutions '' ) whose behavior resembles that of lrs solutions .",
    "finally , the most difficult problem is addressed in section  [ past ] : we present a detailed analysis of the past attractor of the full system and the associated past asymptotic behavior of generic solutions .",
    "we begin this section with an introduction to the general relativistic theory of elasticity . however , since the only object of the theory used in this paper is the stress - energy tensor @xmath4 for elastic matter , we shall restrict ourselves to a discussion of the basic concepts needed for the derivation of @xmath4 .",
    "comprehensive presentations of relativistic elasticity can be found in the references listed at the end of the paper .",
