    "thus , the core could be progressively eroded by the surrounding h - he envelope but the time scale of this erosion process remains uncertain . if the time scale is short , then the cores of jupiter and saturn would most likely be completely dissolved today , resulting into a heavy - element - enriched h - he fluid envelope .",

    "[ fig : diff_heavy ] we can estimate the diffusion coefficient to be close to 0.1  mm@xmath46/s , which results in a typical diffusion time scale of @xmath47 years . such a time scale would suggest a nearly complete erosion of the core for a planete of 4.5 billion years .",
    "but we assumed here a full and efficient convection . yet ,",
    "if a semi - convective pattern sets in , the efficiency of the mixing could be significantly decreased and the erosion process also inhibited .",

    "the location of the dissociation and the metallization of hydrogen is of first importance because it is related to the demixing of hydrogen and helium @xcite .",
    "if hydrogen is stabilized or is less metallic , the demixing occurs at higher pressures and , thus , deeper in the planet .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the electronic properties is therefore necessary to identify the effect of the heavy elements on the metallization .",
    "the calculation of the diffusion coefficients of the different species shows that hydrogen and helium are at most only marginally affected by the presence of the heavy elements .",
    "we were able to estimate the diffusion coefficients for oxygen and silicon in the h - he metallic phase and obtained values between 0.01 and 1  mm@xmath46/s .",
    "we also obtained values for the viscosity ranging between 0.1 and 1 mpa.s indicating a turbulent behavior of the convection in giant planets .",
    "these ionic transport properties are typically extremely challenging to determine in high - pressure experiments , yet crucial for the determination of the dynamics of the deep interior of a planet .",
    "based on our calculated transport properties , we estimate the typical time scale for heavy elements to migrate from the core to the envelope , by diffusion through the boundary layer , to be of the order of a few million years .",
    "this is short on a geological time - scale and suggests that the core of giant planets could be entirely eroded if the convection is efficient . however , if semi - convection sets in , the mixing of the heavy elements into the envelope could be significantly slowed down , which would stabilize the core .",

    "<S> recent observations of jupiter and saturn provided by spacecraft missions , such as juno and cassini , compel us to revise and improve our models of giant planet interiors . even though hydrogen and helium are by far the dominant species in these planets , heavy elements can play a significant role in the structure and evolution of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , giant - planet cores may be eroded by their surrounding fluid , which would result in a significantly increased concentration of heavy elements in the hydrogen - helium envelope . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the heavy elements could inhibit convection by creating a stabilizing gradient of composition . in order to explore the effects of core erosion </S>",
    "<S> , we performed _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ simulations to study structural , diffusion and viscosity properties of dense multi - component mixtures of hydrogen , helium , and silicon dioxide at relevant pressure - temperature conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we computed radial distribution functions to identify changes in the chemical behavior of the mixture and to reveal dissociation trends with pressure and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the computed diffusion coefficients of the different species as well as the viscosity provide constraints for the time scale of the dynamics of the core erosion and the mixing of its constituents into the envelope , which will help improve planetary models . </S>"
