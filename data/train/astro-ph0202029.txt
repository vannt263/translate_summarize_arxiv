    "was discovered by the all - sky monitor onboard rxte as a soft x - ray transient during its 1998 april outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "this outburst , one of the shortest ever detected from a transient ( @xmath015 days ) was observed by cgro ( @xcite ) , rxte ( @xcite ) , asca ( @xcite ) and bepposax  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outburst spectra are complex and can not be fit by any of the models usually applied to the soft x - ray transients .",
    "was also observed in quiescence by bepposax  ( @xcite ) . in 1998 september ,",
    "the source was soft with low absorption . in 1999",
    "september , the source , in a sort of re - flare , had hardened and brightened and became strongly absorbed (  of ( 40  @xmath110 )  @xmath210@xmath3  atom  @xmath4 ) . the 1 - 10 kev unabsorbed fluxes were 4.5  @xmath5  10@xmath6 and 7.6  @xmath5  10@xmath7 erg  @xmath4  s@xmath8  in 1998 and 1999 , respectively .",
    "the origin of x - ray emission from remains uncertain .",
    "the optical counterpart of  is ci  cam , also known as mwc  84 .",
    "this is a supergiant b[e ] star ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this makes  the first high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) with such a companion .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated that the distance to the source was greater than previously thought , making  among the most luminous transients .",
    "the 2 - 25  kev luminosity at the peak of the outburst is 3.0  @xmath510@xmath9  erg  s@xmath8 , assuming the revised distance of 5  kpc .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest that the compact object is traveling in a wide orbit through the dense spherical circumstellar wind emitted from the supergiant b[e ] star . within this picture ,",
    "the outburst would be caused by the same disk instability mechanism responsible for the outbursts in x - ray novae .",
    "it would thus differ from the outbursts observed in be hmxb that recur at multiples of the orbital period , probably when the compact object crosses the equatorial wind from the be star .",
    "@xcite also favor a black hole as the compact object , as infered from the absence of neutron star signatures ( x - ray bursts , periodic x - ray pulsations ) and from the large ratio of peak to quiescent luminosity .",
    "was observed in quiescence by xmm - newton on 2001 august 19 .",
    "we present the spectral analysis of the epic pn data in the 0.2 - 12 kev energy band where the source is detected .",
    "the analysis was carried out using the xmm - newton science analysis software .",
    "the exposure is @xmath0  7  h after filtering out high background level periods and selecting single pixel events .",
    "source counts were extracted from a circular region of 30radius centered on  ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "background counts were obtained from a circular region of 90  radius offset from the source position .",
    "the background count rate represents @xmath037% of the source count rate ( in the 0.2 - 12 kev band ) .",
    "the net ( source minus background ) count rate has a mean value of 0.0071@xmath10.0007 .    in order to ensure applicability of the @xmath10  statistic with",
    "so few counts , we rebinned the extracted spectrum such that at least 20 net counts per bin were present .",
    "the obtained spectrum has 9 significant bins ( figures  [ fig : spectrum_count ] and [ fig : spectrum_photon ] ) .",
    "all spectral uncertainties are given at 90% confidence .",
    "the spectrum of  ( figures  [ fig : spectrum_count ] and [ fig : spectrum_photon ] ) is clearly dominated by a broad feature peaking at 6.5 kev .",
    "considering that the feature around 6.5  kev could be due to an emission from fe , we first tried a model consisting of a power - law to account for the low energy component and a gaussian to account for the 6.5 kev feature .",
    "this model does not provide an acceptable fit to the data : the reduced @xmath10  ( @xmath11 ) is 3.8 for 4 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "a similar result is obtained when including photo - electric absorption . a model with a power - law and",
    "two gaussians does not provide a good fit either .",
    "we then adopted a different fitting approach , considering the 6.5 kev feature not as an emission line , but as a highly absorbed continuum component .",
    "this approach is consistent with the one adopted to fit the bepposax  spectrum of  in quiescence during the 1999 september observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "a model consisting of a power - law ( photon index , @xmath12 , of 1.4@xmath10.4 ) plus an absorbed power - law (  of ( 72@xmath137 )  @xmath210@xmath3  atom  @xmath4 , @xmath12  of 2@xmath11 ) was tried .",
    "this gives a @xmath11  of 1.35 for 4 dof .",
    "an f - test indicates that adding a gaussian at 6.5 kev does not improve the fit : the probability p@xmath13of rejecting the hypothesis that the fit is better including the additional gaussian is 98%",
    ".    a better fit ( @xmath11  of 1.07 for 5 dof ) is obtained using a partialy absorbed power - law model , with an  of ( 61@xmath14 )  @xmath210@xmath3  atom  @xmath4 , @xmath12  of 1.5@xmath10.5 and a partial covering fraction of 0.99@xmath15 .",
    "this model is shown in figures  [ fig : spectrum_count ] and [ fig : spectrum_photon ] .",
    "adding a gaussian at 6.5 kev does not significantly improve the fit ( p@xmath13of 69% ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectrum_photon ] , the contributions of the absorbed and covered component ( dashed line ) and of the unabsorbed and uncovered component ( doted line ) to the total model are shown separetely .",
    "the absorbed and covered component clearly dominates the emission above @xmath05  kev whereas the unabsorbed and uncovered component dominates the emission below @xmath05  kev .    the 1 - 10 kev absorbed and unabsorbed ( derived by setting  to 0 ) fluxes are 1.3 and 9.3  @xmath5  10@xmath6  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath8  respectively , using the partialy absorbed power - law model .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity of 2.8  @xmath5  10@xmath16  erg  s@xmath8 , assuming a distance of 5  kpc .",
    "we have shown that the quiescent x - ray spectrum of during the xmm - newton observation was best modeled by a strongly absorbed power - law (  of ( 61@xmath14 )  @xmath210@xmath3  atom  @xmath4 ) .",
    "such a spectrum is unique among soft x - ray transients , and adds to the growing list of very peculiar properties observed from .",
    "although we note that only simple models could be tested because of the small number of bins in the spectrum , this model is very attractive because it indicates the presence of large amounts of absorbing material within the system itself . thus , this confirms the recently drawn picture of the compact object being embedded within a very dense wind emitted from the b[e ] companion star ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it suggests that the accretion onto the compact object is still occuring at a substantial rate in order to explain the observed quiescent luminosity .",
    "this is also consistent with a compact object continuously travelling through an extended wind and not only crossing an equatorial wind during short intervals as in be systems .",
    "based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
