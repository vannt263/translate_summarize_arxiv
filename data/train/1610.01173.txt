    "the low hd  105211 @xmath21 flux density of 474  mjy reported by @xcite is probably due to their choice to use a uniform aperture radius of 1.5 camera pixels ( @xmath62 ) for the entire survey .",

    "we use the debris disk simulator ( dds ) @xcite to fit sed models to the _ spitzer _ irs / mips and _ herschel _ pacs photometry .",
    "the dds takes as input a stellar spectrum , an inner and outer radius for the dust ring , a dust mass , an analytical or numerical description of the dust number density @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the distance from the star ) , and a grain size distribution of the form @xmath71 ( @xmath51 is the grain radius and we set @xmath72 ) . the assumption of a power - law grain size distribution is reasonable for the larger grains , but dynamical models that include loss processes such as poynting - robertson drag predict that for grains with @xmath73 , the size distribution turns over so that the grain abundance _ increases _ with radius @xcite . since the far infrared - emitting dust grains are most likely part of a collisional cascade that includes large grains , we set @xmath74  mm for all models .",
    "larger particles would be present , but the grain size distribution is so steep that the larger grains would contribute only @xmath75 of the total thermal emission .",
    "the dds also allows the user to set the chemical composition of the grains ; here we assume 100% astronomical silicate @xcite . since we do not explore the composition options , our model seds are plausible but not unique . in particular , the grains could have organic components or ice mantles , though ice would eventually succumb to photodesorption .",
    "however , the small number of spectral data points that cover the bulk of the disks emission do not warrant extremely flexible fits .",
    "the parameters we explore are minimum grain size @xmath6 , the debris ring s distance from the star @xmath76 , the width of the debris ring @xmath17 ( assuming a gaussian number - density profile centered at @xmath76 ) , and the mass of grains smaller than @xmath74  mm .",

    "we also checked for consistency between the @xcite model photospheres and the allwise photometry @xcite and found good agreement .",
    "the allwise photometry was particularly important for hd  105211 , which has conflicting photosphere models in the literature due to poor - quality 2mass photometry ; and for hd  52265 , which has a poor - quality 2mass @xmath81 magnitude .",
    "table [ tab : seds ] lists the fitted parameters for each sed , and figures [ hd33636sed]-[hd202206sed ] show the model seds .",
    "we begin our discussion of seds with a detailed look at the photosphere model and mid - ir photometry of hd  105211 , which requires extra care because of the imprecise 2mass data , then move on to the ensemble properties of our disks .",
    "hd  105211 is bright enough to have saturated the 2mass detectors , so the @xmath79 flux densities have @xmath82% errors .",
    "the near - infrared data is important for constraining the rayleigh - jeans side of the spectrum , as the turnover to an @xmath83 power law happens in the @xmath84 band for hd  105211 .",
    "a further issue is that the simbad database identifies hd  105211 as a spectroscopic binary , though @xcite find that a single star is the most probable configuration .",
    "if hd  105211 is a binary , a single photosphere model might not accurately reproduce the emission from both components .",
    "@xcite presented the first _",
    "observations of hd  105211 , reporting an infrared excess at @xmath12 but not at @xmath85 .",
    "their measured excess was based on a model photosphere with @xmath86  k , which was fit to @xmath87 photometry and predicted a photospheric flux density of 363.4  mjy at @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite then measured @xmath88  k from spectroscopy , which agrees with the optical spectral type f2  v of @xcite .",
    "@xcite added @xmath80 photometry from @xcite to the photospheric fit constraints , which yielded a best - fit photosphere model with @xmath89  k. moving to the new , hotter photosphere model yields a higher near - ir / mid - ir flux ratio and a lower predicted photospheric @xmath4 flux density of 321.9  mjy .",
    "based on the @xcite model photosphere and our re - reduction of the mips data , hd  105211 has a @xmath90 excess at @xmath4 ( see table [ tab : photometry ] ) .",
    "@xcite computed a third model photosphere with a predicted @xmath4 flux of 347.1  mjy , which combined with the new mips re - reduction yields a @xmath91 excess at @xmath4 .",
    "the allwise w1 photometry best corresponds to the @xcite photosphere model , with a monochromatic @xmath92 flux density only @xmath93 higher than the model .",
    "as the star is saturated in w2 ( see figure [ hd105211sed ] ) , we do not re - fit the model photosphere with the allwise data added .",
    "we adopt the @xcite photosphere model for this work , but note that the accuracy of the spectral type and effective temperature would benefit from additional data .",
    "@xcite find an intrinsic scatter of about two spectral subtypes in a cross - correlation analysis of their spectral library  for example , the spectrum of a star typed f8  v might best match the f6  v template spectrum  a level of uncertainty consistent with the differences between the analyses of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    there is still concern about the irs data , however .",
    "since slit loss led to 5 - 10% flux density underestimates in irs , @xcite calculated absolute flux densities by assuming that the shortest - wavelength data points of the sl1 module ( beginning at @xmath94 ) traced the photosphere .",
    "the ll2 and ll1 data were then spliced to the sl1 data so as to make a continuous function .",
    "however , the data at the long - wavelength end of ll2 ( @xmath95 ) have large error bars , and there appears to be a drop in fractional excess flux at the short - wavelength end of ll1 ( @xmath96 ; see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that hd  105211 has multiple debris belts , which would account for the rise and fall of fractional excess at @xmath95 , but the irs data are not conclusive .",
    "what is concerning is that the irs data differ from the allwise w4 data ( after conversion to monochromatic flux at @xmath97 ) by @xmath98 .",
    "( @xcite and our mips re - reduction disagree on the errors in the mips @xmath4 flux , but adopting @xmath99  mjy from @xcite , our irs @xmath4 flux density is consistent with the mips data . ) the disagreement between w4 and irs may be due to the w4 color correction ; the bandpass is broad and the sed is no longer photospheric .",
    "the irs , allwise , and mips data all indicate an infrared excess at @xmath100 , but the level of excess is still open to debate .",
    "we also have some concerns about the photometry at @xmath11 due to the bright source east of the target , which may have led to over - subtraction of the sky background .",
    "we find it difficult to reproduce the `` peakiness '' of the sed at @xmath10 ; dust models that fit the @xmath101 flux ratio tend to over - predict the @xmath57 flux density and models that reproduce the @xmath102 flux ratio tend to under - predict the @xmath15 flux density",
    ". a low abundance of grains near the minimum size , as suggested by collisional cascade models that predict non power - law size distributions @xcite , might improve the sed fit by decreasing the @xmath101 flux ratio .",
    "the sed model shown in figure [ hd105211sed ] is a compromise between the opposing constraints at 32 and @xmath12 . reducing the maximum grain size that contributes to the emission from the 1  mm assumed for all disks",
    "could reduce the predicted @xmath11 flux density , but we doubt the physical realism of any model that includes small grains without a continuous size distribution extending to macroscopic grains . the uncertainties in the pacs and mips photometry ( section [ sec : photometry ] ) and the underlying photosphere model must be kept in mind when discussing the dust properties .",
    "based on the infrared excess at both @xmath4 and @xmath103 , we strongly suggest follow - up observations of hd  105211 with both jwst and alma .",
    "we now turn our attention to the properties of the dust in our systems , including the disk radius , minimum grain size , location of dust relative to the parent planetesimal population , and possibility of planet sculpting .",
    "first , we find that all of the dust seds peak between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which is typical of debris disks from the dunes program @xcite .",
    "we do not find any sources that are brighter at @xmath11 than @xmath10 , a feature which could indicate either a background galaxy in the beam @xcite or a disk of unstirred , primordial grains @xcite .",
    "we diagnose the presence of superheated small grains by computing the parameter @xmath106 , the ratio of the disk radius from our sed models ( in which dust temperature depends on grain size ) to the disk radius if only blackbody grains were present : @xmath107 in equation [ eq : blackbody ] , @xmath108 is the temperature of blackbody grains , @xmath109 is the wavelength of maximum emission , and @xmath110 is the radius of the ring of blackbody dust .",
    "the disks in our sample have @xmath111 ( table [ tab : seds ] ) .",

    "each disk must contain a population of small grains that do not emit efficiently at @xmath113 wavelengths and so heat above the local blackbody temperature . given the presence of small grains ,",

    ", the peak flux density is much redder than @xmath12 and the _ herschel _ observations indicate colder blackbody temperatures than the _ spitzer_-based photometry . we emphasize that the seds modeled here are not based on blackbody grains ",
    "our comparison between single - temperature blackbody models simply highlights the importance of far - ir photometry in characterizing the debris rings .",
    "the _ spitzer _ irs spectra provide the best constraint on minimum grain size . in the rayleigh regime , where @xmath115 , the grain opacity @xmath116 declines with wavelength as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 for simple conductors and insulators @xcite . at @xmath15 , the center of the spectral window used by @xcite to detect infrared excesses , @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "we find that the lack of _ spitzer _ irs fractional excesses at @xmath121 ( with the exception of hd  105211 ) and the small , though detectable , excesses at @xmath15 exclude grains smaller than @xmath122 , as such grains would emit efficiently from @xmath123 .",

    ", we find blowout size limits of @xmath138 for the range of star luminosities and spectral types in our sample .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite and @xcite show that @xmath139 , the ratio of the true minimum grain size to the minimum predicted value from equation [ eq : radpress ] ( now with @xmath140 calculated self - consistently from grain optical properties ) , is a decreasing function of stellar luminosity , approaching unity for a - type stars but with larger values for solar - type stars .",
    "our results agree well with theirs : the most luminous star in our sample , hd  105211 with @xmath141 , has @xmath142 , while our least luminous star , hd  33636 with @xmath143 , has @xmath144 .",
    "we suggest that our _ herschel _ observations most likely trace dust near the `` birth ring '' @xcite , where the source planetesimals reside .",
    "the largest grains that can emit like blackbodies at @xmath11 have radii set by @xmath145 , such that @xmath146 .",
    "the lifetime @xmath147 of a grain against poynting - robertson drag is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the speed of light . for @xmath150 grains , we find @xmath151 for all of the disks in our sample .",
    "the quantity @xmath152 for @xmath150 grains is between 0.7 and 6.5 for all systems except one ; hd  50554 has age estimates that differ by a factor of 10 ( 3.3  gyr from @xcite vs.  0.33  gyr from @xcite ) , so @xmath152 is either 1.6 or 16 . since the grains that can contribute significantly to the @xmath11 emission have lifetimes against radiative drag of _ at least",
    "1/4 the star age , they are likely to be destroyed by collisions before migrating significantly .",
    "similarly , all systems have @xmath153 ( where @xmath154 ; @xmath155 is the radiation pressure force given @xmath156 and @xmath157 is the gravitational force ) for @xmath150 grains , so their orbits are not substantially modified by radiation pressure .",
    "the dust ring widths from our sed fits are likely close to the true widths of the source planetesimal belts , with two caveats : ( a ) mutual grain collisions will increase the eccentricity dispersion and therefore the ring width @xcite , and ( b ) our models do not account for the possibility that the small grains have a wider spatial distribution than the large grains  we assume all grain sizes are well mixed throughout the dust annulus . in reality , radiation pressure might push the smallest grains to wide or eccentric orbits @xcite and create structures similar to the @xmath158  pictoris , hr  8799 , and hd  95086 `` halos '' seen in scattered light @xcite . pushing the small grains in the hd  105211 system to wider orbits might help resolve the conflict between the @xmath101 flux ratio and the @xmath11 flux density discussed in section [ sec : hd105211 ] .",
    "the hd  105211 disk also has the smallest @xmath159 size ratio of any disk in the sample , so is most likely to be affected by radiation pressure . follow - up with ground - based adaptive optics or the hubble space telescope could detect scattered light from blowout - size grains . if our _ herschel _ photometry traces the birth rings , our systems can be added to the list of @xmath160 debris disks with radii larger than the probable solar nebula radius of 80  au @xcite .",
    "planetesimal formation seems to be a robust process even out to extremely large distances @xcite .",
    "finally , many lines of evidence suggest that at least some planetesimal belts are sculpted by planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the disk surrounding hd  50554 is a true kuiper belt analog in its spatial distribution , with a best - fit radius of 45  au and ring half - width of 4  au .",
    "since hd  50554 is slightly younger than the sun ( 3.3  gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its disk may be similar to the kuiper belt at an earlier stage of evolution and may have a neptune - like planet at its inner edge . in n - body simulations of planetesimal belts with giant planets orbiting just inside their inner edges ,",
    "@xcite find that the width of the planetesimal belt increases with both planet mass and planet / disk semimajor axes .",
    "here we find that the width of the best - fit dust ring roughly increases with distance from the star , from @xmath161  au at @xmath128  au for hd  50554 to @xmath162  au for both hd  202206 ( @xmath163  au ) and hd  105211 ( @xmath164  au ) , though the width of the ring becomes less observationally constrained as @xmath76 increases .",
    "however , we have no direct constraints on the presence or absence of planets on wide orbits , and we measure fractional dust luminosities of @xmath165 ( table [ tab : seds ] ) , which are consistent with dust production from icy planetesimals stirred by pluto - size dwarf planets @xcite .",
    "here we have presented new _",
    "herschel _ and updated _ spitzer _ photometry of five sunlike stars with debris disks of kuiper belt size and larger . both extended structure in the images and sed fits from the debris disk simulator @xcite",
    "indicate that the disks are not composed of blackbody grains ; instead , small grains are present and disks are wider than their blackbody radii",
    ". as seen by @xcite , the minimum grain sizes in the best - fit seds are in the @xmath166 size range , larger than the radiation pressure blowout size .",
    "all targets are younger than the sun ( though still on the main sequence ) , so we may be seeing kuiper belt analogs at earlier phases of evolution .",
    "the disks have luminosities consistent with dust production from icy planetesimals stirred by pluto - size bodies @xcite .",
    "we also find that the _ herschel _ @xmath11 emission likely emanates from the birth ring of planetesimals , so we add our targets to the growing list of sunlike stars with planetesimals beyond the radius of the solar nebula .",
    "one caveat is that our sed models may not be unique : we assumed 100% astronomical silicate grains and did not consider mixtures of silicate , ice , and/or organic grains ( though icy grain mantles will likely photoevaporate ) .",
    "another unexplored possibility is that different grain sizes have different radial distributions .",
    "although three of the stars host planets discovered by doppler searches ( hd  50554 , hd  52265 , and hd  202206 ) , the planets are on short - period orbits that should be dynamically decoupled from the debris disks .",
    "any planets that sculpt the debris disks in this sample have not yet been detected .",
    "hd  33636 has an m6 companion in a @xmath167  au orbit @xcite , indicating that the debris disk at 85  au is circumbinary .",
    "hd  105211 may also be a spectroscopic binary , though @xcite find a single star more probable .",
    "hd  33636 and ( possibly ) hd  105211 complement @xmath168 previous detections of circumbinary debris disks , though there is some indication that the frequency of cold debris disks may be higher among single stars @xcite .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence that any of our targets host `` holey '' debris disks which have planets in the gaps @xcite , though the irs spectrum of hd  105211 may have a peak at @xmath169 ( see section [ sec : hd105211 ] ) .",
    "based on target declination , alma follow - up would be possible for hd  33636 , hd  52265 , hd  105211 , and hd  202206 .",
    "the most compelling target is hd  105211 due to both its brightness0.7  jy at @xmath10and its spatial extent of @xmath2 , wider than the disk surrounding the t tauri star tw  hydrae .",
    "hd  33636 and hd  52265 are also good alma targets based on their extended structure in the _ herschel _ pacs images .",
    "we also suggest jwst follow - up of hd  105211 using the ( a ) the miri coronagraph with the @xmath170 filter and ( b ) the miri low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) . based on the allwise w1 photometry",
    ", we find that the the @xcite photosphere model is likely accurate , which indicates that hd  105211 has a strong infrared excess at @xmath170 .",
    "observations with jwst would allow us to precisely locate the inner edge of the cold debris ring and possibly detect a hot inner debris belt , if it exists .    funding for this work was provided by nasa research support agreement 1524391 .",
