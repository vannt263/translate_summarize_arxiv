    "multiphase fluid flows are ubiquitous in engineering problems and natural processes . generally , a phase interface can be described by sharp interface approach @xcite or diffuse interface approach @xcite . in the sharp interface approach",
    ", the fluid is separated into some sub - domains by sharp interfaces in which each sub - domain contains only one phase , and the fluid properties such as density and viscosity are discontinuous across the interfaces . on the contrary , in diffuse interface approach ,",
    "the fluid is treated continuously in the whole domain and the fluid properties vary smoothly across interfaces",
    ". an attractive feature of the diffuse interface method is it can model the complex interfacial dynamics without explicitly tracking the interfaces , and this feature makes it an ideal basis for developing efficient numerical schemes .    in the diffuse interface approach , usually a phase - field variable ( or order parameter ) is used to distinguish different phases .",
    "the variable takes two distinct constant values in the bulk regions of the two phases , respectively , and changes smoothly across the interface .",
    "based on the phase - field variable and its gradient , the free - energy of the system can be modelled , from which one can obtain a transport equation for the order parameter .",
    "the dynamic change of the phase interface can then be described by this equation coupled with the governing equations of the flow . in most of previous works on immiscible binary mixtures of incompressible fluids ,",
    "the flow is usually assumed to be governed by the incompressible navier - stokes equations including the interfacial force .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the assumption that the mixture is incompressible in the whole region is inconsistent with the conservation of mass as the densities of the fluids are unequal . to remedy this physical problem , a quasi - incompressible phase - field model , which assumes the mixture is incompressible in bulk regions but compressible in the mixing layer , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "a number of numerical schemes have been developed based on phase - field models including spectral methods @xcite , finite element methods @xcite and lbe methods @xcite . among these methods ,",
    "the lbe method has received particular attentions due to some distinctive features @xcite .",
    "the first phase - field lbe model was proposed by he _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite which adopts an order parameter to track the interface of two incompressible fluids .",
    "however , there exist some differences between the derived governing equations and the phase - field theory for incompressible two - phase flows @xcite , and numerical instability can be produced for systems with a large density ratio .",
    "later some improved lbe models based on phase - field theory have been developed from different viewpoints .",
    "for instance , in order to improve numerical stability , lee and lin @xcite designed a three - stage discretization multiphase lattice boltzmann ( lb ) scheme by discretizing the gradient terms in different manners before and after the steaming step . later , fakhari _ et al . _ @xcite further generalized the model @xcite by employing a multi - relaxation - time collision operator .",
    "zheng @xcite and zu @xcite respectively proposed the modified lbe models in order to recover the correct cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation .",
    "however , the extra terms in the both models will produce a large error in the interface capturing and the computation will become unstable as the dimensionless relaxation time equals to 1@xcite . to overcome these problems , liang _",
    "@xcite proposed a new lbe model by introducing a time - dependent source term in the evolution equation .",
    "recently , zheng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented an alternative model based on the kinetic theory to solve the problem .",
    "although those lbe models @xcite could recover the ch equation exactly , the recovered momentum equations are still inconsistent with the target momentum equations for the incompressible flows .",
    "_ @xcite noted this problem and proposed a correction method by introducing an artificial interfacial force .",
    "all of the above lbe models were developed based on the incompressible phase - field models that do not conserve mass locally as the two fluids have different densities . in this work",
    "we aim to develop a lbe model based on the quasi - incompressible phase - field theory for two - phase flows , which can ensure the exact mass conservation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the quasi - incompressible phase field model is briefly reviewed , and a lbe model based on this theory is constructed in sec .",
    "3 . in sec .",
    "4 , some numerical simulations are carried out to validate the proposed model , and some comparisons with a recent incompressible lbe model are also made .",
    "a brief summary is presented in section 5 .",
