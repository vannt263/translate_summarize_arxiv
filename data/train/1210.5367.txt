    "the majorana nature of the neutrinos could be immediately established by confirming the possible occurrence of any one out of four experimentally distinguishable modes of lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta @xmath10 decay , namely the double - electron emission @xmath11 , double - positron emission @xmath12 , electron - positron conversion @xmath13 and double - electron capture @xmath14 .",
    "the latter three modes are energetically competing and we shall refer to them as @xmath15 decay . the kinetic energy release in the @xmath16 mode is the largest .",
    "however , the conservation of energy - momentum requires the emission of an additional particle in the @xmath16 mode .",
    "the absorption of atomic electrons from the @xmath17-shell is forbidden for the @xmath18 transition due to the emission of one real photon .",
    "consequently , various processes such as internal pair production , internal conversion , emission of two photons , @xmath19-capture etc .",
    "@xcite have to be considered .",
    "the decay rates of the above mentioned processes have to be calculated at least by the third order perturbation theory and are suppressed by a factor of the order of 10@xmath20 in comparison to the @xmath13 mode .",
    "hence , the experimental as well as theoretical studies of @xmath21 decay had been mostly restricted to @xmath22 and @xmath23 modes only .",
    "the idea behind the resonant enhancement of @xmath24 mode @xcite , has been recently reanalyzed @xcite and it has been shown that there will be resonant enhancement of the @xmath16 mode upto a factor of 10@xmath25 provided the nuclear levels in the parent and daughter nuclei are almost degenerate i.e. @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 , where the energy difference is for atomic levels .",
    "subsequently , detailed theoretical studies on the resonant enhancement of @xmath29 mode have also been performed @xcite . in the mean time , experimental studies on resonance enhancement of @xmath24 mode in @xmath30ge @xcite , @xmath4ru @xcite , @xmath6cd @xcite , @xmath31sn @xcite , @xmath32ce @xcite and @xmath33w @xcite isotopes have already been carried out and the study of this @xmath34 mode is emerging as an interesting possibility for the investigation of @xmath35 decay .",
    "in addition to establishing the dirac or majorana nature of neutrinos , the observation of @xmath35 decay can also ascertain the role of various mechanisms in different gauge theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath36 decay can clarify a number of issues , such as the origin of the neutrino mass , their absolute scale as well as hierarchy , and possible cp violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath37 decay modes can provide us with similar but complementary information .",
    "the observation of @xmath21 decay modes would be helpful in determining the presence of mass mechanism or right handed currents @xcite .",
    "the varied scope and far reaching nature of the experimental and theoretical studies on the @xmath38 decay have been recently reviewed by avignone _",
    "@xcite , vergados _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and faessler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite    the nuclear @xmath39 decay proceeds through strongly suppressed channels which are very sensitive to details of the wave functions of the parent , intermediate and daughter nuclei .",
    "hence , the calculations of non - collective nuclear @xmath39 decay related observables are quite challenging . in any nuclear model ,",
    "there are three basic ingredients , namely the model space , the single particle energies ( spes ) and the effective two body interactions .",
    "usually , these are chosen on the basis of practical considerations . while all models are able to reproduce most of the observed @xmath40 decay half lives by adjusting free parameters in the model , different predictions",
    "are obtained for other observables , like the @xmath35 decay half lives , due to the inherent freedom in choosing the basic ingredients of the model .",
    "a variety of nuclear models is currently employed in this endeavor .",
    "large scale shell model calculations are quite successful @xcite , but highly limited in the description of medium and heavy mass nuclei .",
    "the most popular and successful model is the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its extensions @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of nuclear deformation has also been carried out in the deformed qrpa @xcite , the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) @xcite , the pseudo - su(3 ) @xcite , the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , and the energy density functional ( edf ) @xcite approaches . in the study of both @xmath41 and @xmath35 decay modes ,",
    "the renormalized value of axial vector coupling constant @xmath42 is a major source of uncertainty . in the @xmath35 decay ,",
    "the role of pseudoscalar and weak magnetism terms @xcite is crucial , and the finite size of nucleons ( fns ) and short range correlations ( src ) play a decisive role vis - a - vis the radial evolution of nuclear transition matrix elements ( ntmes ) @xcite .    usually , three different approaches have been adopted for estimating the uncertainties in ntmes for @xmath43 decay .",
    "the spread between all the available calculated ntmes has been used as the measure of the theoretical uncertainty @xcite . the same spread between ntmes",
    "can also be translated into average and standard deviation , which can be interpreted as theoretical uncertainty @xcite . according to bilenky and grifols",
    "@xcite , the observation of @xmath44 decay of different nuclei will provide a method , in which the ratios of the ntmes - squared can be compared with the ratios of observed half - lives @xmath45 and the results of calculations of ntmes can be checked in a model independent way .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties were estimated by rodin _",
    "_ @xcite by considering two models , qrpa and rqrpa , with three sets of basis states and three realistic two - body effective interactions based on the charge dependent bonn , argonne and nijmen potentials .",
    "it was found that the variances were substantially smaller than the average values and the results of qrpa , albeit slightly larger , are quite close to the rqrpa values . the critical analysis of the advantages and deficiencies in the approach of rodin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite by suhonen @xcite and rodin @xmath46 @xmath47 @xcite is quite instructive .",
    "further studies on the uncertainties in ntmes due to src using the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) @xcite and by self - consistent coupled cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite have also been carried out .",
    "recently , the uncertainties in the @xmath43 ntmes due to the exchange of light @xcite and heavy @xcite majorana neutrinos have been calculated in the phfb model by employing four different parameterizations of the pairing plus multipolar effective two body interaction and three different parameterizations of jastrow type of src . in the present work ,",
    "we employ the same formalism for estimating uncertainties in ntmes for @xmath13 and @xmath16 modes of @xmath4ru , @xmath48pd , @xmath6cd , @xmath7xe , @xmath8ba and @xmath9dy isotopes for the @xmath18 transition .",
