    "the concept of quantum coherence is one of the most fundamental in quantum mechanics . according to the general principles quantum coherence of the wave function",

    "static _ external potential . on the other hand ,",
    "_ inelastic _",
    "scattering processes may ( and in general do ) destroy the phase coherence of the wave function . for electrons in a metal",
    "such processes ( e.g. inelastic electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering ) are important at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "but as the temperature @xmath0 is lowered inelastic processes become less intensive and the corresponding inelastic scattering time @xmath2 for an electron in equilibrium tends to infinity at @xmath3 .",
    "hence , one could consider natural that interaction may cause dephasing in a metal at nonzero @xmath0 , but _ not at _ @xmath1 .",
    "surprizingly , it was found in many experiments with disordered metals ( see @xcite and references therein ) that the effective dephasing time @xmath4 for the electron wave function saturates at the level @xmath5 ns and does not depend on temperature below @xmath6k .",
    "these findings are in a _ clear contradiction _ with the above point of view according to which the time @xmath4 should increase to infinity as @xmath0 approaches zero .",
    "scattering on magnetic impurities , heating and the external noise were suggested as possible reasons for saturation of @xmath4 observed in earlier experiments .",
    "all these reasons were convincingly ruled out by the authors @xcite , and it was argued that it is the _ zero point motion of electrons _ in a disordered conductor that causes dephasing at @xmath1 .",
    "a theory of the effect of quantum decoherence at low temperatures was suggested by the present authors @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that at sufficiently low @xmath0 _ the high frequency quantum noise _ of the effective electronic environment is responsible for the effect of quantum decoherence .",
    "it was predicted that at low @xmath0 the decoherence rate @xmath7 for 1d metallic systems saturates at the level @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wire conductance per unit length , @xmath10 is the fermi velocity . the result ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is in a very good agreement with the experimental findings @xcite as well as with previous experimental results .",
    "the predictions @xcite inevitably lead to another _ fundamental conclusion _ : low dimensional metals _ do not become insulators even at _ @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , e.g. in the case of 1d systems the localization length is @xmath11 , while the result ( [ 1 ] ) yields the effective decoherence length @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the elastic mean free path and @xmath14 is the effective number of conducting channels .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath15 ( which is always the case in metallic wires ) @xmath16 is _ parametrically _ smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that due to interaction with other electrons the phase coherence of the electron wave function is destroyed _ faster _ than the electron can get localized , i.e. localization _ never _ takes place under the above conditions .    since the results @xcite",
    "imply a necessity to strongly reconsider the commonly adopted point of view on the role of interaction in disordered metals at low @xmath0 , it is not surprizing that the subject still remains controversial .",
    "moreover , it is sometimes argued that quantum decoherence at @xmath1 would contradict to general principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "what are the arguments against the quantum noise in a disordered metal as a reason for quantum decoherence of electrons ?",
    "usually it is argued on a general level , adopting a much simpler quantum mechanical model in order to illustrate the main statement .",
    "on one hand this makes sense indeed : the nature of a fundamental quantum mechanical effect ( or the absence of it ) can and should be understood without unnecessary complications . on the other hand",
    ", one has to make sure that all significant features which yield the effect in a more complicated problem are still present in a simplified one .",
    "there is an obvious danger in making too many simplifications : one can easily throw out the baby with the bathwater .",
    "consider a quantum particle colliding with a harmonic oscillator with the frequency @xmath18 .",
    "assume that the interaction potential is short range and before the collision the particle was in the state with the energy _",
    "smaller _ than @xmath19 , while the oscillator was in the ground state .",
    "the general features of this _ scattering problem _ are well known : after interaction the oscillator remains in the ground state ( the particle does not have enough energy to excite it ) , the particle energy also remains the same as before interaction , the particle wave function  although in general changes as a result of interaction  stays fully coherent .",
    "thus no energy exchange between the particle and the oscillator has occured , and no phase coherence has been lost due to interaction .",
    "what remains is to understand if the above consideration is relevant to the problem in question .    at the first sight it appears to be relevant indeed .",
    "although in a metal the electron interacts with other electrons instead of oscillators ( let us ignore the electron - phonon interaction for simplicity ) , at @xmath1 all states below / above the fermi energy should be occupied / empty , and no energy can be transferred : the electron can not be scattered into any lower energy state due to the pauli principle as well as to any higher energy state because no energy can be extracted from other electrons due to the same reason .",
    "it follows immediately , that at @xmath3 the phase coherence of the electron wave function in a metal can not be lost due to the very same reason as in the above example with the particle and the oscillator : there exists no inelastic scattering .",
    "this consideration turns out to be too naive , however",
    ". it may be sufficient if the _",
    "infinite _ time limit can be taken already at the very first step of the calculation as e.g. within the standard formulation of the scattering problem . in this case",
    "the result will be proportional to the delta - function of the energy difference between the initial and the final states ensuring the energy conservation .",
    "however , at any finite time the energy - time uncertainty principle should be taken into account .",
    "the energy uncertainty can be not necessarily small , especially if the particle interacts with an _ infinite _ number of oscillators .",
    "this is crucially important for the effect in question . on top of",
    "that our problem is more complicated because we are dealing with an _ interacting _ quantum many body system rather than the scattering problem for two particles with well defined in- and out - states .",
    "the electron energy fluctuates as a result of interaction with other electrons , only the total energy of all electrons plus the interaction energy is conserved .",
    "one may introduce the effective oscillators also in this case , they are just the modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the interaction between the electron and one such mode can be naively described as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath22 is the wave vector and @xmath23 is the electron coordinate .",
    "the interaction potential remains finite for any @xmath23 , i.e. the electron always interacts with the oscillator and the scattering problem can not be formulated .",
    "actually the problem is even more complicated because the electron interacts with an infinite number of such oscillators at the same time .",
    "it is also important that _ in the presence of interaction _ the energy exchange between the low energy particle and the high energy oscillator is possible _ without excitation _ of the latter simply because its lowest energy level acquires a finite width .",
    "this effect depends on the strength of interaction , but it always exists because the interaction is never `` turned off '' .",
    "one might argue that this simply means that electrons are `` bad '' particles in the presence of interaction and one should rather define `` better behaving '' quasiparticles and calculate all measurable quantities in their terms .",
    "this does not always help because of at least two reasons .",
    "one is that quasiparticles ( if they exist ) are usually defined within an approximate procedure . although the approximation may work well for calculation of certain physical quantities",
    ", it may fail for other quantities .",
    "another reason is that the transformation of the basis ( even if it can be done exactly ) may not be convenient if the measurements are done only with a `` bad '' particle . in this case calculation with `` good '' quasiparticles can be by far more complicated , and it is much simpler to `` get rid '' of all but one `` interesting '' degree of freedom at an early stage of calculation by tracing them out in the full density matrix .",
    "this is the key idea of the feynman - vernon theory of the influence functionals @xcite developed further by caldeira and leggett @xcite and schmid @xcite in application to an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators with the ohmic spectrum .",
    "superconducting josephson junctions may serve as an example of a fermionic system where the same ideas have been worked out @xcite .",
    "in this case it is possible to exactly integrate out all electron degrees of freedom and describe the system dynamics in terms of only one collective variable  the josephson phase @xmath24 .",
    "of course , @xmath24 is known to behave `` badly '' ( its quantum dynamics is incoherent in almost all cases , see e.g. @xcite ) but namely this variable is of interest in josephson junctions and squids just because the junction current and voltage operators as well as the flux operator in squids are defined in terms of @xmath24 . in this case `` better behaving '' quasiparticles are simply irrelevant .",
    "therefore it appears to be unreasonable to argue in favour of `` coherent '' quasiparticles if all measurements are done only with `` incoherent '' variables .",
    "we believe that a similar situation is encountered if one calculates the conductance of a disordered metal . actually in this case it is even more complicated because it is not clear if `` good '' quasiparticles can be introduced at all .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will demonstrate how the fundamental effect of quantum decoherence can be derived within a simple model of a quantum mechanical particle interacting with an environment consisting of a collection of harmonic oscillators .",
    "it is remarkable that already this simple model captures all significant features of the effect and allows to understand why the arguments against its existence fail .",
    "we also establish the relation between our results and the standard perturbative treatment of a scattering problem .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a rigorous microscopic analysis of quantum decoherence in a disordered metal .",
    "discussion of recent experiments and comparison with our theory are presented in section 4 .",
    "the main conclusions are outlined in section 5 .",
    "consider a quantum - mechanical particle ( or a more general system ) characterized by a coodinate @xmath25 and the action @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "assume that this particle interacts with another quantum system described by a coordinate @xmath27 and the action @xmath28 .",
    "we will call the latter quantum system `` environment '' .",
    "the total action for the system `` particle+environment '' has the form @xmath29=s_0[q]+s_{\\rm",

    "an extensive discussion of this theory can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only repeat the key steps .    by definition the probability @xmath33 is given by the square of a transition amplitude @xmath38 . in the absence of interaction ( @xmath39 )",
    "the oscillator coordinate @xmath32 does not enter into the expression for @xmath40 .",
    "however for @xmath41 there appears an additional force acting on a particle @xmath31 .",
    "this force depends on @xmath32 which is itself a quantum variable .",
    "thus we can not anymore restrict ourselves to the dynamics of @xmath31 , but rather should deal with the total hamiltonian for a system `` @xmath42 '' or , equivalently , with a complete action ( [ sqq ] ) .",
    "of course , the probability @xmath33 is again equal to the square of the corresponding transition amplitude @xmath40 which now depends on both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is important , however , that we are not interested in the final state of the oscillator and do not make any measurements of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we should sum over _ all _ possible final states of @xmath32 and the formula for the probability @xmath33 takes the form @xmath43 this is an important point .",
    "each of the terms in the sum ( [ w1 ] ) represents a probability for a system to come into the state @xmath44 . since the subsystem @xmath32 can be in _ any _ final state @xmath45 , in order to find the total probability @xmath33 we have to add all these probabilities together",
    "one can slightly generalize the problem and describe the evolution of the density matrix of the system @xmath46 from some initial to some final state .",
    "this evolution is described by the equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the initial density matrix of the particle @xmath31 . for the sake of simplicity in what follows",
    "we will assume that there is no interaction between @xmath31 and @xmath32 before @xmath36 .",
    "then the total initial density matrix can be factorized as @xmath49 . here",

    "its important advantage is that no approximations have been done so far , i.e. the above formulas are _",

    "the force for a given environmental system depends in general on the motion of @xmath31 , of course , since the environmental system is affected by interaction with the system of interest @xmath31 '' .",

    "one can also establish the general form of the kernel @xmath50 ( [ j ] ) .",
    "it is relatively complex and is not presented here .",
    "more interesting situation emerges if we modify our model and consider our particle @xmath31 interacting with @xmath81 oscillators with frequencies @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding generalization is trivial : one should just substitute @xmath83 in ( [ sri1 ] ) and carry out the summation over all @xmath84 .",

    "the obtained exact solution allows to make several important observations .",
    "one of them is completely obvious : the particle @xmath31 looses its coherence due to interaction with the caldeira - leggett bath of oscillators . indeed in the long time",
    "limit we have @xmath97 and the kernel ( [ jint ] ) effectively reduces to @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the system size . in other words , for any initial conditions the density matrix tends to the same equilibrium form @xmath100 which is not sensitive to the initial phase . according to eqs .",
    "( [ jint],[f1 ] ) the decay of off - diagonal elements of the initial density matrix is exponential at any nonzero @xmath0 with the characteristic time @xmath101 . at @xmath1 the off - diagonal elements decay as a power law @xmath102 but also in this case the information about the initial phase is practically lost in the long time limit .",
    "another observation is that at sufficiently long times the average value of the kinetic energy of the particle @xmath103 ( [ energy ] ) is not zero even at @xmath1 _ irrespectively _ to its initial energy . at high temperatures @xmath104",
    "the energy is given by its classical value @xmath105 , but at lower @xmath0 its value is determined by the interaction parameter @xmath106 and the high frequency cutoff parameter @xmath86 .",
    "it is sometimes believed that if initially all the bath oscillators are in the ground states and the particle energy is zero , no energy exchange between the particle and the oscillators will be possible because the particle has no energy to excite the oscillators and the latter in turn can not transfer their zero - point energy to the particle .",
    "this statement is obviously incorrect in the presence of interaction : the low energy particle will increase its average energy while the interaction energy will be lowered to preserve the energy conservation for the whole system .",
    "the presence of @xmath86 in eq .",

    "one should not think , however , that such oscillators need to be excited in order to make this exchange possible .",
    "the energy transfer mechanism is different : in the presence of interaction the oscillator energy levels ( including the ground state one ) acquire a finite width and the oscillator can exchange energy in arbitrarily small portions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that some of the above effects can not be correctly described within a naive perturbation theory in the interaction based e.g. on the fermi golden rule . just for an illustration let us choose the plane wave @xmath108 as the initial state of the particle @xmath31 and evaluate the transition probability @xmath109 to the state with the momentum @xmath110",
    ". without interaction one has @xmath111 . for small @xmath112 at @xmath1 in the long time",

    "it is obvious that the result ( [ wpp ] ) can not be recovered in any finite order of the perturbation theory in @xmath116 .",
    "the above model can also serve as an illustration of the role of `` good '' quasiparticles in the effect of quantum decoherence .",
    "it is clear that in this model one can carry out exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian and introduce a new set of independent ( and therefore coherent ) particles / oscillators .",
    "it is also clear that this transformation will by no means influence our result for the density matrix @xmath46 : this result is exact .",
    "thus also the calculation with `` good '' quasiparticles will yield the incoherent dynamics of @xmath31 , however with much more efforts and with loss of physical transparency .",
    "the basic reason for dephasing of @xmath31 is , however , transparent also in this case : @xmath31 will be expressed as a sum of _ infinite _ number of independent particle / oscillator cordinates and therefore will be able to return to its initial state only after infinite time .",
    "the second example is a quantum particle on a ring .",
    "again we would like to calculate the probability @xmath33 , but now we have to choose both @xmath117 and @xmath118 on a ring .",
    "we choose @xmath119 ( see fig.1 ) , i.e. @xmath33 is the probability for a particle to return to the same point @xmath120 . again without interaction",

    "we have @xmath139 .",
    "now let us analyze the effect of interaction .",
    "the expression for the return probability @xmath135 turns out to be insensitive to interaction due to exactly the same reason as in our first example : this probability is determined by the pairs of _ equivalent _ paths @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath135 , the return probability @xmath136 determined by the pairs of time reversed paths _ is _ affected by interaction .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the most interesting physical situation when the energy of a particle @xmath31 remains conserved during its motion .",
    "then the simplest pair of the time reversed paths is : @xmath142 and @xmath143 is an even function of @xmath144 . substituting these paths into ( [ sr0],[si0 ] ) after a simple integration we find @xmath145 the result",
    "( [ sri1 ] ) demonstrates that the return probability @xmath136 for a particle @xmath31 after a time @xmath35 for the time reversed paths acquires the factor @xmath146 due to interaction with a harmonic oscillator with a frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the probability @xmath135 remains unaffected .",
    "the whole consideration can be trivially generalized to the case of more complicated time reversed paths with an arbitrary winding numbers @xmath69 . in this case",
    "we again find an additional factor ( [ fsi ] ) in the interference term @xmath136 and @xmath147 is determined by an expression similar to ( [ sri1 ] ) which also depends on @xmath69 .",
    "the term @xmath148 is again zero for such paths for all @xmath69 .",
    "since no new effects emerge at @xmath149 , in what follows we will analyze only the simplest case @xmath150 ( [ sri1 ] ) .",
    "the first conclusion one can draw from the result ( [ sri1 ] ) is that no qualitative changes in the system behavior emerges if one varies the temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the value @xmath151 is smaller at low @xmath61 as compared to the high temperature limit @xmath152 but the effect persists even at @xmath1 .",
    "thus the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath18 turns out to be important only in a quantitative sense , no qualitative dependence on this relation should be expected .",
    "a much more important parameter is @xmath153 .",
    "we see that the value @xmath151 and hence @xmath136 oscillate in time with a period @xmath154 . after each such period",
    "the interference term @xmath136 restores its `` nonineracting '' value while at all intermediate times the value @xmath136 is smaller than in the noninteracting case .",
    "in this situation we still can not speak about decoherence : the system keeps information about its initial phase and periodically returns to its initial state . on top of that",
    "if the radius of the ring @xmath127 is constant in time ( see below ) we have @xmath155 , i.e. the oscillations of @xmath136 practically disappear in the long time limit .",
    "all these results are not surprizing : one should not expect to find the decoherence effect in the system of two quantum mechanical particles .",
    "quantum decoherence appears after the next step : we again modify our model coming from the interaction with one oscillator to the infinite set of oscillators with the ohmic spectrum ( [ ohm ] ) . in this case after the integration of ( [ sri1 ] ) over @xmath18 one gets @xmath156 this equation yields @xmath157 at @xmath1 and @xmath158 at @xmath159 .",
    "these results are in a nice qualitative agreement with those obtained in the exactly solvable model studied above . there the exponential decay of the off - diagonal elements of the initial density matrix @xmath160 with @xmath161 was found at any @xmath162 while at @xmath1 a power law decay ( [ power ] ) was observed . in both cases",
    "the similarity is obvious if one interchanges @xmath127 and @xmath163 .",
    "we observe from ( [ fsi ] ) that if @xmath147 is small the influence functional @xmath164 and no decoherence occurs .",
    "however for @xmath165 the interference of the time - reversed paths is completely suppressed , and quantum dephasing takes place . by setting @xmath166 we can , therefore , define the typical size of the ring @xmath167 beyond which the effect of quantum decoherence becomes important . in our particular example",
    "the characteristic dephasing length @xmath16 decreases as @xmath168 at @xmath159 and it is constant @xmath169 at @xmath1 .",

    "therefore it is quite natural that at @xmath1 the interference term @xmath136 , although suppressed by a factor @xmath171 , does not decay in time . qualitatively the same property is observed in our result for the decoherence time in a disordered metal ( [ 1 ] ) : if we treat @xmath10 as a formal parameter which may be put equal to zero we will immediately arrive at a zero decoherence rate @xmath7 in this limit . the same is true for the high temperature result @xcite .",
    "the above situation is , however , not very relevant for a metal where conducting electrons move with the velocity @xmath172 which absolute value does not change in time .",

    "one such property is that the suppression of quantum interference between time reversed paths increases if the size of the loop grows in time .",
    "another property is that oscillators with @xmath180 may give the dominating contribution to dephasing . in the above model the frequencies @xmath181",
    "give the maximum contribution , but if the spectrum of the problem is different ( as e.g. in a disordered metal , see below ) high frequency modes @xmath182 may also become important .",
    "the physical reasons for this conclusion were already clarified above : in order to have energy exchange in an interacting system it is not necessary to excite the high frequency oscillators , broadening of their ground state levels is sufficient .",
    "it is well known that the high frequency cutoff @xmath86 enters the expression for the interaction induced decoherence rate of a quantum particle in the periodic @xcite and the double well potentials @xcite . the same is observed here for an exactly solvable model of a free damped particle in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "our model also demonstrates at which step of our calculation the effect of dephasing appears .",
    "interaction of the particle @xmath31 with one harmonic oscillator leads to the oscillations of the interference term @xmath136 with the oscillator frequency @xmath18 .",
    "these oscillations are natural since the initial state is not the eigenstate of the system .",
    "yet no dephasing appears .",
    "if coupling to _ many _ oscillators with different frequencies is introduced the probability @xmath136 will be _ always _ suppressed and the system will _ never _ return to its initial state .",
    "obviously this mechanism of dephasing has nothing to do with the temperature of the environment and it persists even at @xmath1 . in this limit",
    "the exponential decay of @xmath136 in time is due to increase of the loop size with @xmath35 .",
    "the phase breaking length @xmath16 ( [ l ] ) depends only on the interaction strength and appears to be ( roughly ) insensitive to the particular ( e.g. ballistic or diffusive ) type of a particle motion .",
    "one might wonder what is the relation between the above analysis and the standard perturbative treatment of a scattering problem for a quantum particle interacting with a harmonic oscillator . beside its general importance",
    "the scattering approach is also of a practical relevance because it is frequently applied to conductance calculations in mesoscopic systems .",
    "the usual definition of a scattering problem operates with in- and out - scattering states measured after exactly _ infinite _ time . in other words ,",
    "the limit @xmath183 is taken already at the very first step , and the whole calculation is carried out only in this limit .",
    "this is sufficient in many physical situations , but not for our problem due to the reasons to be clarified below . here",
    "we will keep @xmath35 finite ( although possibly large ) throughout the calculation and let it go to infinity in the end . with this in mind a direct connection to the scattering problem can be easily established .    consider a quantum particle @xmath31 scattered on a harmonic oscillator with a frequency @xmath18 . before scattering the oscillator",
    "is assumed to be in its ground state , and the particle is in the state with wave function @xmath184 and the energy @xmath185 . assuming the interaction to be of the same form as in ( [ sqq1 ] ) and proceeding perturbatively in the interaction strength @xmath58",
    "one can easily derive the probability @xmath186 for a particle @xmath31 to leave the state @xmath184 after the time @xmath35 .",
    "it is just the sum of the transition probabilities @xmath187 into all possible final states @xmath188 which are orthogonal to @xmath184 in the absence of interaction .",
    "one easily finds ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "this result implies @xmath191 , i.e. at large @xmath35 the transition rate experiences fast oscillations and approaches @xmath192 at @xmath183 .",
    "if @xmath193 for all @xmath194 ( i.e. @xmath184 describes the ground state of the noninteracting problem ) the transitions are highly improbable at sufficiently long times and one may conclude that with the dominating probability the particle remains in its initial state and no quantum dephasing takes place .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that the time average of the escape probability @xmath33 ( [ gr ] ) is not equal to zero already in this case .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the energy - time uncertainty principle .",
    "let us now consider scattering on _ many _ oscillators . as before we will assume that the frequency spectrum for these oscillators is ohmic ( [ ohm ] ) .",
    "in order to define the scattering problem we also assume that interaction exists only in a certain space region @xmath195 , i.e. we put @xmath196 . without interaction the eigenstates of a problem",

    "subsituting this expression into ( [ gr ] ) and carrying out the summation over the final states @xmath201 and over the oscillator frequencies ( making use of ( [ subs ] ) with @xmath202 ) , we find @xmath203 further assuming that the initial particle energy is small @xmath204 after simple integrations we obtain @xmath205 we observe that the escape probability @xmath186 is not zero and , moreover , it is not necessarily small .",
    "the reason for that is transparent . although the contribution of each oscillator to @xmath186 is small , it is not zero at any finite @xmath35 due to the energy - time uncertainty principle .",
    "the sum of these small contributions from _ many _ oscillators is finite and yields the result ( [ gr3 ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that by no means this result is in contradiction with the energy conservation law , rather it demonstrates that one should be careful applying the energy arguments to describe the time evolution of an interacting quantum system , especially if it consists of an infinite number of degrees of freedom . even at times",
    "much larger than the characteristic time scale ( in our problem the relevant time scale is set by the dephasing time @xmath4 ) the energy uncertainty may be sufficient for @xmath186 to significantly differ from zero .    in order to observe the relation of a perturbative expression ( [ gr3 ] ) to our previous results we set @xmath206 to be of order of the system size @xmath207 .",
    "after that the similarity between ( [ gr3 ] ) and e.g. eqs . ( [ power],[si5 ] ) becomes completely obvious . requiring that @xmath208 ( the escape is complete ) and using ( [ gr3 ] ) with @xmath207 one immediately arrives at the estimate ( [ l ] ) for the decoherence length @xmath209 derived previously with the quasiclassical analysis of the exact influence functional",
    "this result leaves no room for doubts concerning the validity of the quasiclassical description of quantum dephasing at @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the comparison of the results ( [ power],[gr3 ] ) with ( [ si5 ] ) demonstrates that the quasiclassical approximation rather _ underestimates _ the dephasing effect of interaction : @xmath16 may only become shorter if fluctuations around the classical trajectory are taken into account .",
    "another obvious conclusion is that at any @xmath0 ( including @xmath1 ) the effect of quantum decoherence in not only due to low frequency oscillators which , moreover , can be even completely unimportant .",
    "the relative contribution of oscillators with small @xmath18 depends on the particular form of the spectrum ( @xmath210 ) , being more important in the subohmic case @xmath211 and practically irrelevant in the superohmic case @xmath212 when the high frequency oscillators yield the main effect .",
    "the latter situation will be encountered in the next section where it will be shown that for a @xmath213-dimensional disordered metal one has @xmath214 .",
    "again we emphasize that the above results _ do not _ imply that the processes with high energy transfers are important for dephasing at _ any _ @xmath0 .",
    "it is _ erroneous _ to interpret the parameter @xmath18 as describing the energy transfer : in our calculation the integral over @xmath18 always represents the summation over the bath oscillators ( cf .",

    "it was demonstrated in section 2 that a finite decoherence rate for a certain variable of interest has no direct relation to the lifetime of quasiparticles ( the latter is infinite in the case of a free particle in the caldeira - leggett bath ) . in our calculation",
    "@xmath4 determines the dephasing time for _ real electrons _ and not for the landau quasiparticles .",
    "our result implies that interacting electrons are `` bad '' particles since their wave functions dephase even at @xmath1 .",
    "the possibility to construct `` better behaving '' quasiparticles remains questionable for disordered metals .",
    "furthermore , even if such quasiparticles exist their properties are completely unknown",
    ". therefore at this stage they can hardly be used for calculation of any physical quantity .",
    "an important advantage of our method is that it allows for a direct calculation of measurable quantities in terms of interacting electrons without appealing to the fermi liquid hypothesis .",
    "our results for the decoherence time at low @xmath0 turn out to be in a remarkably good agreement with available experimental data obtained in various physical systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have already carried out a detailed comparison between our theory and the experimental results @xcite obtained for 1d au wires . the agreement within a numerical factor of order one",
    "was observed for all samples studied in @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath4 and @xmath16 are _ defined _ with such an accuracy no better agreement can be expected in principle .    here we will present a comparison of our theory with two other experiments carried out with 2d electron gas in semiconductor structures .",
    "these systems are somewhat different from the metallic ones mainly because of much higher effective resistance .",
    "the parameters of the systems were chosen in a way to realize a quasi 1d conducting system with disorder .",
    "one such experiment was carried out by pooke _",
    "@xcite in narrow si pinched accumulation layer mosfets .",
    "these authors studied samples with resistances ranging from 120 to 360 k@xmath337 and observed a finite decoherence rate @xmath7 at all temperatures . on a log - plot ( not shown ) clear signs of saturation at low @xmath0",
    "the corresponding data for @xmath16 @xcite obtained for 3 samples are presented in fig . 2 and in the table 1 together with our theoretical predictions .",
    "note , that the experimental value of @xmath16 at @xmath1 was obtained by a linear extrapolation @xmath338 of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "table 1    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the temperature dependence of the data @xmath16 @xcite is also in excellent agreement with our predictions at all @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "3 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the measured maximum values for @xmath4 were compared with the theoretical formula suggested in refs . @xcite and",
    "a discrepancy by a factor of 50 was reported .",
    "this fact allowed the authors to conclude @xcite that their experimental results for @xmath4 argue against the idea of decoherence by zero - point fluctuations of the electrons .",
    "the comparison of the data @xcite with our theoretical results clearly demonstrates that this conclusion is simply an artefact of the inadequate choice of a theoretical formula adopted in @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the decoherence rate @xcite _ strongly support _ the idea of decoherence due to intrinsic quantum noise rather than argue against it .    in ref .",
    "@xcite also another interesting experimental observation was made : a crossover to a highly resistive state was found around @xmath6 k. this observation was interpreted in @xcite as a thouless crossover to the regime of strong localization and was also qualified as contradicting the very idea of quantum decoherence at @xmath1 .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) for the systems studied in @xcite one has @xmath339 .",
    "hence , the weak localization correction at low @xmath0 ( [ delsig ] ) should be of the same order as the drude conductance ( in fact , this is exactly what was observed in @xcite ) and the thouless crossover can not be ruled out theoretically for such small @xmath14 . also the result for @xmath4 may become more complicated for small @xmath14 @xcite because of a somewhat more important role of capacitive effects .",
    "this may in principle lead to a relative increase of @xmath16 ( it appears , however , that this effect is not very important in @xcite ) .",
    "thus even the presence of a thouless crossover in the samples @xcite would by no means contradict our theoretical results and hence the idea of quantum decoherence at @xmath1 .",
    "\\(ii ) the interpretation of the observed effect as a thouless crossover is not quite convincing .",
    "this interpretation is based on two reasons @xcite : ( i ) at the crossover @xmath16 was found to be `` only '' @xmath340 times smaller than @xmath17 and ( ii ) the resistance of a wire segment of the length @xmath341 was found to be @xmath342 k@xmath337 .",
    "the first observation does not contradict to our theory which predicts @xmath343 at low @xmath0 .",
    "as to the resistance of a segment @xmath341 it is of the order of the quantum resistance unit also at temperatures @xmath344k , i.e. well above the crossover .",
    "hence , no definite conclusion can be drawn .",
    "\\(iii ) the expression for @xmath345 used in @xcite makes sense only provided the condition @xmath346 is satisfied ( @xmath99 is the wire length ) .",
    "for @xmath347 the wire can be viewed as @xmath348 _ independent _ samples connected in series ( in @xcite @xmath81 is typically of order @xmath349 ) . since the the length of each of such samples @xmath16 is @xmath340 times _ smaller _ than the localization length @xmath345 it is somewhat naive to seriously believe that strong localization can be observed in such samples relying only on the `` order - of - magnitude '' character of the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath345 at the crossover . moreover , assuming the dependence @xmath350 one immediately observes that the `` standard '' crossover condition @xmath351 would hold at temperatures @xmath352 times smaller than the actual crossover temperature , i.e. at @xmath353 mk .",
    "we see no way how the thouless crossover can be expected above this temperature range for the systems studied in @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) the inequality @xmath354 is violated in @xcite at all relevant @xmath0 : at the crossover one has @xmath355 depending on the sample , and @xmath356 remains of order one even at @xmath357k , i.e. well in the weak localization regime .",
    "if one believes that the violation of the above condition signals the breakdown of flt due to interaction the whole discussion of the thouless crossover becomes pointless .",
    "an alternative would be to acknowledge that the value @xmath356 may not be the relevant parameter as far as flt is concerned .",
    "but in any case _ real electrons _ dephase and therefore can hardly be described within the thouless scenario of strong localization .",
    "\\(v ) since @xmath358 and @xmath17 is several times larger than @xmath16 at the crossover interaction definitely plays a very important role `` helping '' to localize electrons instead of destroying localization .",
    "if so , why not to assume that the whole effect is solely due to interaction and not due to spacial disorder ?",
    "for instance , it is well known that the mobility of a quantum particle in a _ periodic _ potential can decrease dramatically with @xmath0 if this particle is coupled to a dissipative environment ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at @xmath1",
    "this particle can even get localized due to the effect of quantum noise of the environment @xcite which completely destroys the phase coherence of the wave function . within this scenario",
    "the crossover to a highly resistive state @xcite can be considered as _ supporting _ the idea of quantum decoherence due to intrinsic quantum noise .",
    "thus , although a detailed interpretation of the crossover @xcite is still an open problem , presently we see no way to use it as an argument against quantum decoherence at @xmath1 .    it was argued in @xcite that the effect of saturation of @xmath4 observed in many experiments at low @xmath0 can be caused by the external microwave noise .",
    "although filtering of external noise is indeed a serious experimental problem it is quite obvious that the above explanation faces several severe problems . without going into details let us just indicate some of them .",
    "firstly , according to the arguments @xcite the dephasing effect of the external noise may not be accompanied by heating for low resistive samples with @xmath359 k@xmath337 , whereas in the opposite case of highly resistive samples heating is unavoidable .",
    "it is not clear how to match this conclusion with the experimental results @xcite where clear signs of saturation of @xmath16 at @xmath360 1k were seen for samples with resistances up to @xmath361 k@xmath362 k@xmath337 .",
    "secondly , the formula ( [ 1 ] ) _ quantitatively _ ( within a factor of order one ) describes the low temperature value of the decoherence time @xmath4 measured in different experiments in at least 10 1d semiconductor and metallic samples . in order to interpret the results of all these measurements in terms of external noise",
    "one should assume that external noise always adjusts itself to a particular value of the sample conductance ( in various experiments these values differ by many orders of magnitude ) and the fermi velocity .",
    "more than that , the corresponding electric field produced by the external noise inside the sample should be always of the same order as one due to the intrinsic quantum noise",
    ". it would be interesting to estimate the probability for such a coincidence in ( at least ) 10 different samples .",
    "thirdly , the presence of the external noise can only be proven experimentally by making experiments with and without necessary filtering and observing different results in these two cases . in ref .",
    "@xcite the external noise power was estimated , however no evidence for its existence in experiments was presented .",
    "in contrast , quantum noise with @xmath363 is well observable reality , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus the explanation of the existing experimental results in terms of external noise turns out to be problematic .",
    "perhaps new experiments are needed to unambiguously rule this issue out .",
    "in the present paper we have discussed the fundamental effect of interaction induced quantum decoherence in disordered metals .",
    "we have considered a simple model of a quantum particle interacting with the caldeira - leggett bath of oscillators .",
    "an exact solution in the case of a free damped particle demonstrates that the off - diagonal elements of the particle density matrix decay in the long time limit at all temperatures including @xmath1 . for a particle on a ring",
    "similar results are found .",
    "a very transparent physical picture of the effect of quantum decoherence due to interaction with a quantum bath of oscillators emerges from our analysis .",
    "the interference contribution to the return probability @xmath136 for a particle interacting with _",
    "one _ oscillator with a frequency @xmath18 oscillates in time and is smaller than one for all time moments except @xmath364 when the system returns to its initial state .",
    "if interaction occurs with _ infinitely many _",
    "oscillators with a continuous distribution of frequencies the particle will _ never _ return exactly to its initial state . at @xmath1",
    "the return probability will be suppressed by a factor @xmath365 where @xmath116 is the viscosity of the environment and @xmath127 is the size of the return path .",
    "this defines the typical dephasing length @xmath366 . for a particle in a diffusive environment",
    "the typical size of such a path grows with time as @xmath367 , and the interference probability will decay as @xmath368 .",
    "this is the effect of quantum dephasing .",
    "it has an essentially quantum mechanical nature , therefore its existence at @xmath1 is by no means surprizing . at nonzero @xmath0 the effect increases due to increasing fluctuations in the environment .",
    "the main features of the effect derived by means of our simple model are reproduced within the rigorous analysis developed for a disordered metal , in this case one should account for the pauli principle and the sample dimension .",
    "the electron interacts with the fluctuating electromagnetic field produced by other electrons .",
    "this field can be again represented as a collection of oscillators with a somewhat more complicated spectrum than in the caldeira - leggett model .",
    "quantitatively the results will depend on that , but the physical nature of the effect remains the same .",
    "the effect of quantum dephasing studied here has no direct relation to the question about the existence of `` coherent '' quasiparticles in the problem .",
    "it is obvious that only the behavior of measurable quantities is of physical importance . if these quantities ( e.g. the current or conductance in the case of disordered metals ) are expressed in terms of `` incoherent '' variables , quantum dephasing yields directly measurable consequencies . a convincing illustration for that is provided by the existing experimental data .",
    "our results indicate a necessity to reconsider the commonly adopted point of view on the role of interactions in disordered metallic systems . in particular",
    ", one arrives at the conclusion that no electron localization takes place and low dimensional disordered metals with generic parameters do not become insulators even at @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of the late albert schmid whose works constitute one of the major contributions to the field .",
