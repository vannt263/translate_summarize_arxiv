    "the extraction of useful and physically meaningful parameters from a measured energy spectrum is a long - standing question in particle and nuclear physics experiments .",
    "electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeters have been a cornerstone of particle physics experiments and today are still irreplaceable as tools for making new discoveries , like at the large hadron collider  @xcite . because of their finite sizes and the presence of insensitive materials , em calorimeters do not faithfully convey the incident energy of a particle in many cases .",
    "this fact can be significant for experiments that require relatively high accuracy in energy , like the reno50  @xcite , juno  @xcite , and jinping  @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "several functions are frequently used to fit the spectrum of deposited energy in electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "the gaussian function and truncated gaussian function are very popular in determining the total absorption peak .",
    "another widely used function originally introduced for this purpose is the crystal ball ( cb ) function  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic gaussian and exponentially modified gaussian distribution have also been used , for example in refs .",
    "the total absorption peak extracted using these functions has intrinsic biases .    in this article ,",
    "a detailed discussion is given with respect to the cb function without loss of generality .",
    "the cb function was developed to describe the energy deposition of electrons or gammas in an array of nai ( tl ) crystals of the calorimeter of the crystal ball experiment .",
    "it has been used , for example , to describe em energy deposition in the liquid scintillator detectors of the daya bay neutrino experiment  @xcite and the invariant mass of a resonance with radiative energy loss in the belle  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite experiments .",
    "it has become one of the standard functions supported by popular analysis softwares , for example , roofit of root  @xcite .",
    "the cb function is piecewise - defined , consisting of a gaussian peak and a power - law tail .",
    "the function can be expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mean and standard deviation of the gaussian peak , @xmath3 is the exponent of the tail function , @xmath4 gives the connecting point of the gaussian and tail function , and @xmath5 is a normalization factor .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are generally used to study the energy scale and resolution of a calorimeter .    with the high statistics often accumulated in experiments or simulations , we observed a consistently poor @xmath6 per number of degrees of freedom ( ndf ) when fitting with the cb function , and significant biases of the extracted means and resolutions , which will be demonstrated .",
    "theoretically it is difficult to find a physical motivation for two piecewise - defined sub - functions .",
    "the impact of the tail to the fitted mean and standard deviation of the gaussian is indirect and obscure .",
    "furthermore , there is no apparent representation of the number of totally absorbed events .    in this article",
    ", we briefly discuss the energy deposition of photons and electrons in an em calorimeter and introduce a physically - motivated em calorimeter function in section  [ sec : newfunc ] , present performance studies using geant4  @xcite simulation for three typical applications of em calorimeters with photons up to 50 mev in section  [ sec : performance ] , discuss additional details of the calorimeter function in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the energy measured in an electromagnetic calorimeter is described with the electromagnetic calorimeter function ( calorimeter function for short ) @xmath7 : @xmath8 which is a convolution of the deposited energy spectrum and the detector resolution .",
    "detector nonlinearity and nonuniformity are not directly considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1group](a ) shows a typical distribution of the energy deposited by monoenergetic gammas or electrons in an em calorimeter .",
    "the distribution has some noticeable features :    * the peak is a kronecker delta function corresponding to the complete absorption of the energy ; * the tail to the left corresponds to the partial absorption of energy in the sensitive region of the detector ; * the shape and fraction of the tail depends on the actual detector dimensions , materials , and structure .",
    "detector energy resolution can often be approximated by a gaussian function and is generally a function of energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1group](b ) gives the measured spectrum after a constant - resolution gaussian smearing .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1group](c ) illustrates the contributions of the peak and tail portions after the gaussian smearing .",
    "the smeared tail spreads into the gaussian peak from the left , causing the maximum of the spectrum to occur below the true gaussian peak energy , and apparently enlarging the gaussian resolution .",

    "in this section we examine the performance of the calorimeter function .",
    "three practical cases were studied using geant4.10 : uniformly distributed @xmath31 s in a liquid scintillator detector , a calibration source in the center of the scintillator detector , and @xmath31 s directed into a crystal em calorimeter . for each case",

    "the best - fit values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the number of totally absorbed events derived from peak fraction @xmath4 were extracted and compared with the true values of :    1 .   * peak energy * , which is the total absorption energy , 2 .",

    "the @xmath33 is defined as the percentage error of the fit result with respect to the true value : @xmath34      liquid scintillator ( and similarly liquid argon , liquid neon , or liquid xenon ) has been used by numerous neutrino and dark matter experiments , including the kamland  @xcite , double chooz  @xcite , reno  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite , deap  @xcite , and xmass  @xcite experiments .",

    "we simulated 2.2-mev @xmath31 s uniformly distributed in the detector .",
    "the 2.2-mev @xmath31 from neutron capture by hydrogen has been used to measure neutrino oscillation and the reactor neutrino spectrum , in addition to being used for detector calibrations  @xcite .",
    "each 2.2-mev @xmath31 developed an electromagnetic cascade in the detector .",
    "for @xmath31 s in the energy region of [ 0.1 mev , 5 mev ] in the simulated liquid scintillator , the primary interaction is compton scattering , which comprises more than 90% of the total scattering cross - section .",
    "the other two minor processes are rayleigh scattering and pair production .",
    "the total absorption length is approximately 5 cm to 20 cm for photon energies from 0.1 mev to 5 mev  @xcite . the true deposited energy spectrum of the 2.2-mev @xmath31 is shown in fig .  [ fig : adfit](a ) .",
    "the primary @xmath31 and its secondary particles in the cascade sometimes escaped the scintillator resulting in partial energy absorption .",
    "the compton scattering edge of the 2.2-mev @xmath31 and those of the secondary @xmath31 s pile up below 2.2 mev .",
    "a small peak at 1.69 mev due to the escape of one annihilation photon is seen .",
    "the @xmath3620-kev gap just below the peak is due to daughter @xmath31 s that deposited most of their energy and then escaped the scintillator .",
    "the reason the gap is about 20  kev is because that is the energy around which the interaction cross - section begins to increase exponentially ( see , for example , ref .",
    "thus a @xmath31 with energy @xmath37 20  kev is much less likely to escape the detector .",
