    "fitting submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) into the current theory of galaxy formation has been a challenge since their discovery .",
    "they are the most luminous star - forming sources at the epoch where star formation peaks , being detected by their redshifted far infrared ( fir ) emission from cold dust in the submillimeter ( submm ) wavebands .",
    "smgs were detected for the very first time in the hubble deep field at @xmath0 ( @xcite , @xcite ) using the submillimeter common - user bolometer array on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt / scuba , @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of observing smgs is their negative @xmath1-correction : the observed flux coming from star - forming regions remains nearly constant with redshift at these wavelengths , so they can be detected out to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "many observational efforts have been done with the attempt of mapping the global cosmic star formation history and the build - up of the overall stellar mass content of the universe through smgs , as they are useful tracers of the obscured star formation at high redshifts , complementing the cosmic census carried on at shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these include surveys using single - dish telescopes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , just to name a few ) and interferometric observations , both in the continuum and targeting emission lines ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , among others ) .",
    "identification of counterparts at other wavelengths for different samples of smgs has been carried out , either through deep optical / near infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy or deep intermediate / high resolution radio imaging .",
    "this allows the spectroscopic follow - up of smgs , as well as multiwavelength studies .",
    "the largest sample of smgs with spectroscopic follow - up to date was obtained by @xcite , who measured a median spectroscopic redshift of 2.2 for 73 smgs belonging to several fields , having a median @xmath0 flux density of @xmath3 . moreover , using multiwavelength data @xcite derived a median photometric redshift of @xmath4 for 78 single - dish detected smgs in the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdf - s ) over @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "more recent studies have been successful identifying counterparts of single - dish detected smgs using interferometers at millimeter ( mm ) wavebands .",
    "for instance , @xcite performed interferometric observations at @xmath7 of smgs in the central region of the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) field , which had been discovered through single - dish observations at @xmath6 down to a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 3.8 ; complementing this with additional multiwavelength catalogs , they derived a mean photometric redshift of @xmath8 for 16 of these smgs .",
    "having redshift information and multiwavelength photometry allows the performance of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , and then deriving other smg properties as stellar mass and star formation rate ( sfr ) . from several studies exploring these properties ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others )",
    ", there is now some consensus regarding the quite high sfrs of single - dish detected smgs , having several hundreds and even thousands of @xmath9 and hosting significant stellar populations .",
    "these findings place them among the most powerful starburst galaxies in the universe . additionally , making these sources evolve through models , it has been found that smgs are likely the progenitors of local luminous early - type galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "samples of smgs are commonly modeled through hydrodynamical simulations ( @xcite , @xcite ) and semi - analytic models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) within a @xmath10cdm cosmology . since the emission at fir wavelengths for these sources comes from ultraviolet ( uv ) light dust - reprocessing , a key process that needs to be addressed by these models is how the dust present in the galaxy absorbs and re - radiates this light .",
    "while some of the models relate the parameters controlling the dust attenuation with other galaxy properties and constrain their values with local observations , others make use of radiative transfer codes ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others ) to compute the fir luminosity in a self - consistent way",
    ". this last method can be very time - consuming when the sample to be modeled comprises thousands or even millions of galaxies , requiring supercomputing facilities .",
    "there is still a controversy between the modeled and observed abundance of smgs .",
    "the lack of enough sources recovered by adopting a kennicutt @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) reported by @xcite was possibly resolved by @xcite , claiming the need of a flat imf in starbursts , while still reproducing basic properties of the local galaxy population .",
    "this was motivated by the increase both in the total uv light radiated per unit mass of stars and in the yield of metals from core - collapse supernovae , which in turn produces more dust to absorb it . however , the assumption subsequently led to underpredict the @xmath11-band magnitudes for model smgs @xcite .",
    "like these works , other studies were able to predict the abundance of smgs via the change in a given assumption or process , but failing in the agreement with other observational statistics like their redshift distribution @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation for the discrepancy between observed and modeled counts is that the low resolution achieved with single - dish telescopes masks multiple sources within a beam .",
    "this influence on the number of detected sources can be solved through a follow - up of single - dish detected smgs with ( sub)mm interferometry . @xcite and @xcite have discussed the effects of the beamsize on the counts , using models that give the submm emission of galaxies in a self - consistent way .",
    "the present work is motivated by recent @xmath6 continuum atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations of the ecdf - s , which was previously surveyed using the large apex bolometer camera ( laboca ) on the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) telescope @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the brightest sources detected in the laboca ecdf - s submillimeter survey ( less , @xcite ) are comprised by emission from multiple fainter sources , namely the alma less sources ( aless , @xcite ) . with the aim of exploring the properties of smgs in this field , and",
    "inspired by the now - standard abundance matching technique @xcite , we perform a `` count matching '' approach using lightcones drawn from a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we choose various physical galaxy properties given by the model as proxies for their submm luminosities , assuming a monotonic relationship so that the combined laboca plus bright - end alma observed number counts are reproduced . after turning the catalogs of galaxy positions and fluxes given by the different proxies into submm maps ,",
    "we perform a source extraction . with this",
    "we study the effects of the observational process on the recovered counts , as well as the galaxy properties derived from the detected sources .",
    "for finding the best proxy , we explore the redshift , stellar mass and host halo mass distributions .",
    "once the best proxy is determined , several properties for smgs ( as well as for their descendants ) can be predicted .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sagmodel ] gives a brief explanation of the semi - analytic model used .",
    "in section [ lightcones ] we detail the procedure for constructing lightcones of galaxies , while in section [ countmatching ] the count matching technique is described .",
    "section [ obsprocess ] outlines the observational process for constructing the submm maps of simulated galaxies . in section [ results ] results",
    "are discussed , ending with a summary in section [ summary ] .",
    "we use a combination of a cosmological @xmath12-body simulation of the concordance @xmath10cdm universe and the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation sag , acronym for semi - analytic galaxies .",
    "details about the semi - analytic model are given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cosmological simulation was run using the gadget-2 code @xcite .",
    "it gives the dark matter halos and their embedded substructures , in a periodic box of @xmath13 a side , with @xmath14 particles having a mass resolution of @xmath15 ; 100 snapshots giving information for halos at each epoch are collected , being equally spaced in logarithm of the scale factor between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . from those outputs , merger trees are constructed and are then used by sag to generate the galaxy population .",
    "the cosmological parameter values assumed are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with wmap7 data @xcite . below",
    "we present a big picture of the sag model , referring the reader to the papers cited above for a deeper insight on the physical processes included .",
    "hot gas in dark matter halos is isothermally distributed , being drawn from the assumed baryon fraction .",
    "it cools according to a cooling rate , forming a galaxy disc that follows an exponential distribution .",
    "stars form at a rate that depends on the amount of cold gas that gives origin to them , besides dark matter halo properties ( virial radii and velocities ) .",
    "cold gas inflows @xcite are not included in the current version of the sag model .",
    "stars can form quiescently as well as in starbursts .",
    "starbursts can be triggered by mergers ( both major and minor , defined according to the relative masses of the galaxies involved ) and disc instabilities , exhausting all the available cold gas instantaneously and contributing to the bulge growth .",
    "a merger of two dark matter halos leads to the merging of the galaxies within them .",
    "when a merger occurs , satellite galaxies are accreted by a central one after keeping a circular orbit around it , decaying via dynamical friction . furthermore",
    ", a disc becomes unstable when it is massive enough to be dominated by self - gravity , and therefore sensitive to small external perturbations .",
    "both mergers and disc instabilities , besides cold gas accretion , contribute to the growth of a central black hole .",
    "the stellar mass created in each star formation event gives a distinctive number of core - collapse supernovae according to the adopted imf , which in this model is salpeter @xcite .",
    "these supernovae in turn will reheat the cold gas through galactic outflows , transferring it to the hot gas phase . apart from this kind of feedback",
    ", the model considers the heating produced by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) through black hole accretion as responsible of the gas cooling suppression .",
    "star formation events lead to metal pollution in galaxies , yielded via mass losses through stellar winds in stars having low or intermediate mass , as well as supernovae explosions .",
    "the chemical enrichment of the gas affects cooling rates and so star formation .",
    "the degree of efficiency , as well as the fulfillment of several criteria involved in the different physical processes , are regulated by free parameters .",
    "these are tuned in order to reproduce a number of @xmath17 observables ( see appendix [ sagpred ] , where also some of the galaxy properties predicted by the model and not used as constraints are presented ) . after assuring this ,",
    "those parameters remain fixed throughout this work , such that none of the values used is dependent on smg properties ( neither from the model itself nor from observational ones ) .",
    "( line of sight ) is chosen , collecting all the model galaxies that fall within that region ( dots coloured by @xmath24 ) .",
    "this section of the sphere is mapped taking different orientations ( centers indicated by gray points).,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    we use the sag semi - analytic model within the @xmath10cdm framework to follow the history of galaxies , obtaining information about them at different epochs which are given by the chosen output redshifts for the model ( i.e. , the snapshots mentioned in the previous section ) .",
    "we assume that the galaxy sample inside the periodic comoving box of @xmath25 a side is statistically representative of the overall galaxy population in the universe , such that we can build a simulated universe repeating ( if necessary ) in our simulated catalogs semi - analytic galaxies at different epochs of their evolution .    for constructing the simulated universe ,",
    "the observer is placed at the center of a sphere whose radius extends to the highest redshift where a semi - analytic galaxy exists .",
    "the whole spherical volume is populated with galaxies taken from the simulated boxes .",
    "since the redshift separation between two consecutive snapshots is smaller than that corresponding to the side of the box , only one box per epoch is needed in the radial direction .",
    "a lightcone consists of all the galaxies that belong to a particular region in the sky and redshift range ( see fig .",
    "[ cone1dir ] ) , so the choice of a line of sight and limits in right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) around it are needed .",
    "these are chosen as follows . since our aim is to study the counts in the ecdf - s field , we select the same angular area surveyed by less , i.e. , @xmath26 . at the redshifts of interest ,",
    "this area is smaller than the area subtended by the simulation box , so at a given epoch galaxies appear only once in the area covered by the lightcone .    for a given line of sight ,",
    "the repetition of a model galaxy at various redshifts is limited as much as possible , since the repetition of simulated structure might lead to a wrong interpretation of how model galaxies are spatially distributed once we turn them into a map . in order to test the amount of sources appearing in the lightcone at more than one epoch , we map the first octant of the sphere in the redshift range @xmath27 with 58 lightcones having @xmath28 and orientations with roughly uniform coverage in ra and dec . instead of using semi - analytic galaxies , the periodic boxes are filled with a cartesian grid of dots ; they emulate galaxies , so these dots are labeled for keeping control of their frequency of appearance at different epochs .",
    "a catalog is then created for each lightcone containing all the `` grid galaxies '' that fall within it , and a quality factor is computed for evaluating the repetition of structures .",
    "this factor is defined as @xmath29 i.e. , the ratio between the amount of sources that appear at more than one epoch and the amount of sources that are not repeated within the lightcone . with this definition",
    ", a low repetition of structure is expressed as low @xmath30 .",
    "we choose the @xmath31 best orientations as those with the lowest @xmath30 . for this paper ,",
    "@xmath32 lightcones were selected ( see fig . [ q4grid ] ) .",
    "the choice of this number of orientations has the aim of testing the effects of cosmic variance over the results .",
    "the 58 orientations tested span a range in @xmath30 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , with the ten chosen lightcones in the range @xmath35 . through the analysis of galaxy properties presented in this work ,",
    "we have checked that there are no trends between @xmath30 values and the recovered distributions for these ten lightcones .",
    "this technique for choosing the best orientations for lightcones was tested only up to @xmath36 .",
    "since we are interested in galaxy redshift distributions of observed smgs , which peak at @xmath37 , this upper limit is adequate for our purposes .",
    "once a lightcone is constructed , the redshifts of galaxies are computed from their coordinates within it . identifying the particular snapshots of the simulation to which they belong ,",

    "the unknowns are the @xmath6 luminosities of a galaxy sample .",
    "we use this monotonic relationship to assign a third property , namely , the @xmath6 flux density , to the simulated galaxies in such a way that an observational statistics for the latter is reproduced .",
    "the chosen observational statistics are the observed galaxy number counts at this wavelength .",
    "this allows to explore several other statistics for simulated galaxies selected using the matched fluxes , like redshifts , masses , luminosities , etc . by comparing them with distributions derived from observations ,",
    "the quality of the proposed proxies can be analyzed .",

    "these galaxies emit the bulk of their bolometric emission in the fir , corresponding to absorbed uv light by dust that is thermally re - radiated at fir wavelengths ; this uv light comes mostly from young stars , with a minor contribution from agn per cent for aless smgs having a rest - frame @xmath38 absorption - corrected luminosity greater than @xmath39 .",

    ", it makes sense to propose that the bright submm fluxes measured for these sources are correlated in some way with the stellar mass , for instance , in a very simplistic model motivated by the strong correlation of many galaxy properties with stellar mass and the observation of large stellar masses for smgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . or with the dust mass , that partially reprocesses the short wavelength light , or with the star formation rate , as high values give rise to more stars and then more uv emission .",
    "given its low computational cost , the technique offers us the advantage to explore the relationship between several properties ( or combinations of them ) available from the simulation , and the fir emission in a galaxy .",

    "further improvements in the count matching approach could consider the enhancement in mass resolution for the dark matter simulation on which the semi - analytic model is run , the increase in the simulation volume , the incorporation of agn properties as proposed proxies and the inclusion of a more gradual star formation during starbursts @xcite or cold gas inflows in the sag model .",
    "when modeling the observational process , it is also possible to quantify the influence of gravitational lensing on the fluxes and redshift distribution of detected sources , including the boosting of higher redshift sources above the survey limit ; nevertheless , lensing would affect number counts well beyond our covered range for this field and wavelength , according to models ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
