    "although gauge theories and spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) @xcite are rather abstract concepts which are associated with symmetries operating on internal degrees of freedom , their significance and nature emerges in a quite straightforward way through systems that exhibit geometrical properties associated with space - time symetries , and that shares the same basic features as models with gauge structure . in the literature",
    "some works about analogies with classical systems are found @xcite , where different mechanical models are used to illustrate similar characteristics found in particle physics and solid state physics . in this work with a simple mathematical treatment ,",
    "we describe another mechanical system that exhibits ssb and dynamical restitution of a discrete symmetry in a similar fashion as a second order phase transition .",
    "in contrast to the systems reported by the literature , our model is in a closer relation with a thermodynamic system in the sense that the former use the gravity as an essential external parameter to generate symmetry restitution , while ours may generate spontaneous breaking and restitution with only internal interactions , where the gravity act as an external field that causes explicit symmetry breaking , such as external interactions cause explicit breaking in thermal physics .",
    "the model shows not only interesting features that resembles to the ssb in gauge theories , but also involves other related concepts .",
    "for example , it can be used in a basic level of classical mechanics as an application of rotational dynamics and to visualize the stability of systems from energy diagrams . in a higher level",
    ", it can be introduced as an example in the lagrangian formulation of analytical mechanics . in a thermodynamic framework",
    ", this model illustrates the behavior of a first- and second - order trasition according to the tisza s definition .",
    "futhermore , because of the nature of the ssb , this system exhibits a critical behavior near the transition point which belongs to the same universality class as a large number of thermodynamic systems .",
    "thus , this problem may provide instructive insights that concern with more advanced topics into the classical study of the critical phenomena in phase transitions .",
    "in addition , the system presents interesting properties associated with nonlinear solutions , which may be source of chaotic behavior and generates a simple application into the theory of classical chaos .",
    "we consider two identical beads of mass @xmath2 that can slide without friction on a horizontal hoop of radius @xmath3 .",
    "there appears a potential of interaction through a spring attached to both beads .",
    "the spring constant is @xmath4 and its equilibrium length is less that the diameter of the hoop , i.e. @xmath5 the system is sketched in fig .",
    "[ draw ] , where the position @xmath6 of both beads is the same measured from the    center of the hoop .",
    "there are two equivalent equilibrium positions determined by the transformation @xmath7 , which illustrates the presence of a discrete symmetry .",
    "the hoop rotates about the @xmath8 axis at angular velocity @xmath9 which causes the equilibrium position @xmath6 to decrease and the spring to stretch from its natural length @xmath10 to a longer length @xmath11 .",
    "the lagrangian contains the kinetic energy of each bead and the elastic potential of the spring , while the gravitational potential is not considered because the center of mass of the system lies along the horizontal axis @xmath8 .",
    "it is more suitable to write the lagrangian in cylindrical coordinates , which displays in a simpler form the symmetries and constraints of the system . the lagrangian is then written as     from the center . ]",
    "@xmath12    the change in time of the azimuthal angle @xmath13 is identified as the angular velocity of the hoop .",
    "we can eliminate the coordinate @xmath14 through the constraint @xmath15 which indicates that the motion of the beads is restricted along the hoop .",
    "hence , the lagrangian can be expressed in terms of the generalized coordinate @xmath8 as    @xmath16    where we have defined an effective mass @xmath17 and a one - dimensional effective potential given by    @xmath18    with @xmath19 the elastic potential of the spring and @xmath20 the centrifugal potential which contains the rotational dynamics .",

    "when the angular velocity slowly decreases near to the value determined by @xmath36 @xmath37 the minimum of energy becomes flatter . immediately below the critical value @xmath38 , the single minimum bifurcates into two degenerated minima @xmath39 with the same energy",
    "however , the spring chooses one of the minima causing an spontaneously symmetry breaking , where the symmetry transformation @xmath40 is not manifest , and the spring comes to a new equilibrium position in either a positive or a negative coordinate @xmath8 , which is greater with decreasing @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the absolute value of @xmath8 measures the degree of breaking just like an order parameter",
    ".    we can describe this process like a second order phase transition if we investigate the behavior of the effective potential in the critical point with respect to the variation of the angular velocity .",
    "the ehrenfest definition establish that a phase transition with respect to a thermodynamic variable ( like temperature ) is of @xmath42 order if the energy and its @xmath43-order derivatives are continuous at the transition point , whereas the @xmath42-order derivative suffers a finite discontinuous jump .",

    "on the other hand , the quantum theory introduces fluctuations associated with the uncertainty principle inherent into the structure of the theory .",
    "such fluctuations appear spontaneously to unbalance the system toward a not symmetrical state .",

    "<S> we describe a simple mechanical system that involves spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the system consists of two beads constrained to slide along a hoop and attached each other through a spring . </S>",
    "<S> when the hoop rotates about a fixed axis , the spring - beads system will change its equilibrium position as a function of the angular velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the system shows two different regions of symmetry separated by a critical point analogous to a second order transition . </S>",
    "<S> the competitive balance between the rotational diynamics and the interaction of the spring causes an spontaneous symmetry breaking just as the balance between temperature and the spin interaction causes a transition in a ferromagnetic system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the gravitational potential act as an external force that causes explicit symmetry breaking and a feature of first - order transition . near the transition point , the system exhibits a universal critical behavior where the changes of the parameter of order is described by the critical exponent @xmath0 and the susceptibility by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found a chaotic behavior near the critical point . through a demostrative device </S>",
    "<S> we perform some qualitative observations that describe important features of the system .    2 </S>"
