    "gutzwiller - correlated wave functions  @xcite were originally proposed for a variational examination of the one - band hubbard model  @xcite @xmath2 with positive coulomb repulsion  @xmath0 . here ,",

    "gutzwiller s primary intention was to study ferromagnetism in such a system .",
    "unfortunately , the evaluation of expectation values for gutzwiller s variational wave function still poses a generally unsolvable many - particle problem .",
    "gutzwiller introduced an approximate evaluation scheme , the so called _ gutzwiller approximation _ , which was based on phenomenological counting arguments ; for a mathematically sound introduction to this technique , see  @xcite .",
    "more recent research on gutzwiller wave functions focused on the development of better controlled evaluation schemes .",
    "main progress was made in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions  @xcite where the gutzwiller approximation turned out to be exact in some cases  @xcite .    despite its general importance as the most simplistic model for correlated electron systems ,",
    "the one - band hubbard model is only of limited use for the investigation of real materials .",
    "therefore , a second aim was the evaluation of more general gutzwiller wave functions for multi - band models .",
    "such a theory has first been derived in  @xcite and was later used in numerical studies on nickel  @xcite .",
    "the results of these numerical investigations are in excellent agreement with experiments and pose a major improvement over band - structure calculations based on the local - spin - density approximation to density - functional theory .",
    "since the advent of high - temperature superconductivity about 20  years ago , gutzwiller wave functions have been used for the investigation of systems with alleged attractive interactions , most notably the two - dimensional @xmath10-@xmath11-model  @xcite . for the evaluation of those gutzwiller - correlated bcs wave functions approximations",
    "have been used which were based on counting arguments similar to the original gutzwiller approximation . in",
    "@xcite we developed a general theory for the evaluation of superconducting multi - band gutzwiller wave functions in infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "an application of these general results to real materials requires significant numerical efforts . in this report we present first results on the simplest correlated electron system that exhibits superconductivity , the attractive hubbard model .",
    "the same system has been studied using gutzwiller - correlated wave functions in  @xcite , based on an evaluation scheme first derived in  @xcite . for the attractive one - band hubbard model with a gaussian density of states ,",
    "the numerical results of both methods seem to agree .",
    "unfortunately , we can not provide a rigorous proof for the equivalence of both approaches . since the evaluation scheme used in  @xcite",
    "can not be generalized easily to more realistic model systems , we do not further pursue their approach .",
    "we structure our article as follows . in section  [ chap2 ]",
    "we introduce the gutzwiller - correlated superconducting wave functions for the negative-@xmath0 hubbard model and derive analytical expressions for the variational ground - state energy .",
    "the minimisation of this energy is discussed in section  [ chap3 ] . in particular , we derive an effective one - particle hamiltonian which provides a link to arpes experiments . in section  [ chap4 ]",
    "we focus on the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "we discuss the small-@xmath1 limit analytically and provide numerical results for a system with a semi - elliptic density of states .",
    "a summary in section  [ chap5 ] closes our presentation .",
    "we consider the gutzwiller wave function @xmath12 is a normalized quasi - particle vacuum and the local correlator @xmath13 induces transitions at the lattice site @xmath3 between the four atomic states @xmath14 , i.e. , the empty state @xmath15 , the doubly occupied state @xmath16 and the two single electron states @xmath17 .",
    "we denote expectation values with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19 as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . in general , there are 16  variational parameters @xmath22 .",
    "when we assume that there is no magnetic or charge order in the system , it is sufficient to work with only four independent and real parameters : ( i )  @xmath23 , ( ii )  @xmath24 , ( iii )  @xmath25 , ( iv )  @xmath26",
    ". it can be shown that a more general ansatz with complex parameters @xmath22 does not lead to a variational improvement .",
    "as shown in @xcite the four parameters are not independent .",
    "instead , they obey the constraints @xmath27 here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the elements of the uncorrelated local density matrix @xmath30 which we assume to be independent of the site index @xmath3 and the spin index @xmath9 .",
    "the evaluation of equations  ( [ cond2 ] ) leads to @xmath31 with the expectation values @xmath32 we use these equations in order to express the three parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in terms of the fourth parameter @xmath36 , @xmath37 here , we introduced the abbreviation @xmath38 with @xmath39    the expectation value of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for the gutzwiller wave function  ( [ wavefunc ] ) can be evaluated in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions @xcite . for a hopping term",
    "this evaluation yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 are renormalization factors for normal and anomalous hopping .",
    "the expectation value of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) then reads @xmath42 with @xmath43",
    "the variational energy has to be minimized with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath44 whereby the equations  ( [ densmat ] ) and the normalization of @xmath44 need to be obeyed . for this purpose",
    "we introduce lagrange parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we keep the average number of particles @xmath48 fixed by means of a lagrange parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the minimisation problem then becomes @xmath50 the minimization with respect to @xmath51 can be carried out explicitly and leads to an effective schrdinger equation in momentum space , @xmath52 with @xmath53 the one - particle schrdinger equation  ( [ seq ] ) is readily solved , @xmath54 by means of a bogoliubov transformation @xmath55 here , the real coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the energies @xmath58 are determined by the equations @xmath59 and @xmath60 which are solved by @xmath61 the one - particle state @xmath51 is chosen as the ground state of  ( [ seq2 ] ) @xmath62 in @xcite it was shown that the eigenvalues  ( [ ek ] ) in the effective hamiltonian  ( [ seq2 ] ) can be interpreted as quasi - particle energies that might be measured in arpes experiments .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath63 describes the superconducting gap and @xmath64 is a measure for the band - width renormalization .    when we introduce the uncorrelated density of states @xmath65 the elements of the local density matrix  ( [ densmat ] ) can be written as @xmath66 and the one - particle energy reads @xmath67",
    "we assume that the density of states is symmetric and focus on the half - filled case in which certain simplifications occur . by setting @xmath68",
    "we ensure that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "it is @xmath82 in standard bcs theory and @xmath83 for a gutzwiller - correlated bcs state .",
    "the minimisation with respect to @xmath63 then yields @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85 the order parameter @xmath86 in the gutzwiller theory is therefore just renormalized in comparison with the respective bcs parameter @xmath87 an exact calculation of @xmath88 by means of perturbation theory  @xcite yields the same functional form , eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) , however , with a different parameter @xmath89 .",
    "it is @xmath90 in the gutzwiller theory and @xmath91 in the exact evaluation . in the rest of our work",
    "we employ a semi - elliptic density of states of width @xmath92 , @xmath93 which is realized in a bethe lattice with infinite coordination number . for this semi - elliptic density of states we find @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we then have @xmath96 in comparison with the exact value @xmath97 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the condensation energy , i.e. , the energy difference between the superconducting and the normal ground state . both in our approach and in perturbation theory",
    ", one finds to leading order in  @xmath0 @xmath98 for the semi - elliptic density of states the condensation energy is therefore overestimated by a factor of @xmath99 which shows that bcs theory overestimates the condensation energy by a factor of about 14 for a semi - elliptic density of states whereas gutzwiller theory is only off by a factor of four .    in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the bcs energy shows an unphysical divergence of the condensation energy , @xmath100 .",
    "our gutzwiller approach yields the correct @xmath101 behaviour , @xmath102 however , the coefficient @xmath103 is twice as large as the exact result .",
    "this deficit is due to the poor description of the paramagnetic insulator in the gutzwiller theory .      as seen in eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) the gutzwiller ",
    "bogoliubov quasi - particles have a dispersion relation @xmath104 .",
    "the band - width renormalization factor @xmath64 in the gutzwiller theory deviates only slightly from the uncorrelated bcs value @xmath105 , as shown in fig .",
    "it has a minimum @xmath106 for medium - size correlation strength @xmath107 . in the limit",
    "@xmath108 the bcs wave function itself has the optimum expectation value @xmath109 of double occupancies such that the gutzwiller correlator @xmath110 can not achieve any further energy gain .",
    "therefore , the renormalization approaches unity in this limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also plot the average double occupancy in gutzwiller and bcs theory ( see inset ) as well as the ratio of these two quantities . for small values of @xmath1",
    "the double occupancies show a qualitatively different behaviour in both approaches . in gutzwiller theory",
    "we find the well - known linearity @xmath111 whereas bcs theory gives the typical exponential dependence , @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "the bcs value @xmath113 is smaller than @xmath76 only for small values of @xmath1 . for larger @xmath1",
    "the limited flexibility of the bcs wave function leads to an overshooting of the double occupancy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the values of the superconducting order parameter @xmath88 in both theories as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the inset of this figure shows the ratio of the two superconducting gaps .",
    "note that in bcs theory we have @xmath114 .",
    "the order parameters are quite similar in both approaches apart from small values of @xmath1 where @xmath115 other than the order parameter , the superconducting gaps in both theories differ significantly over a large range of correlation parameters  @xmath1 .",
    "equation  ( [ renorm ] ) shows that bcs theory fails when the density of states at the fermi energy  @xmath116 becomes small .",
    "as a first application of our recently developed gutzwiller theory for superconducting systems  @xcite we investigated the attractive hubbard model .",
    "our variational approach leads to the diagonalisation of an effective one - particle hamiltonian , very similar to the corresponding mean - field bcs theory .",
    "quantitatively , however , the resulting quasi - particle band structure differs remarkably from the bcs band energies .",
    "this observation holds , in particular , for the superconducting gap in both theories .    in the limit of small coulomb interaction  @xmath117",
    ", a comparison of our approach with perturbation theory shows that gutzwiller theory reproduces the renormalization of the superconducting order parameter qualitatively .",
    "quantitatively , the results depend on the bare density of the states of the system . for the semi - elliptic density of states , for example ,",
    "our renormalization of the gap is too small by a factor of about two .    the condensation energy , i.e.",
    ", the energy difference between the paramagnetic and the superconducting ground state , is another quantity which is notoriously overestimated in bcs theory .",
    "this holds , in particular , for large  @xmath0 where the condensation energy should approach zero but diverges in bcs theory .",
    "in contrast , our gutzwiller theory gives the correct order of magnitude for the condensation energy for all coulomb strengths .",
    "apparently , the investigation of superconducting systems with gutzwiller wave functions leads to a significant improvement over on simple bcs - type calculations .",
    "therefore , our approach should be a useful tool for the investigation of more realistic model systems that exhibit superconductivity .",
