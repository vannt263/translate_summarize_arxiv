    "historically , radio source counts has been a key observational probe of cosmology , more specifically of the geometry of the universe . in a euclidean universe",
    "the volume scales with distance as @xmath7 whereas the flux density scales as @xmath8 , which means that the integral number of sources ( for a population of non - evolving sources with constant comoving number density ) above any flux density scales as @xmath9 .",
    "departures from this expectation was key evidence for non - euclidean geometry .",
    "more recently , the geometry of the cosmos has been established with precision , and source counts represent a measure of cosmological evolution in radio source populations . the behavior of counts at sub - mjy flux density , the nature and evolution of these sources and the question of whether they constitute a new population are unclear .    at flux densities of @xmath10",
    "mjy a ` flattening ' of normalized differential source counts has been widely reported in literature ( windhorst et al .",
    "1985 ( wmo85 henceforth ) , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . the rms noise level in the latter studies are : @xmath11jy for wmo85 , varying between @xmath12 to about @xmath13jy for hopkins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( see fig.9 from hopkins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) and approximately @xmath14jy for huynh et al .",
    "the flattenning is observed as an apparent change of slope from @xmath15 at @xmath16 mjy to about @xmath17 in the @xmath18 mjy range .",
    "wmo85 examined the optical identifications of faint radio sources and found that the sub - mjy radio source population is dominated by blue spiral galaxies .",
    "later studies , however , have arrived at discordant results and identify the sub - mjy sources with different populations : starburst galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , early type galaxies @xcite , low ( radio ) luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite or a mixture of these .",
    "since spectroscopically complete samples of sub - mjy sources are not available , the exact nature of the population observed as sub - mjy radio sources remains uncertain ; however , it is widely agreed that flattening below @xmath19 mjy requires an evolving population that is different from those that dominate counts at higher flux densities .",
    "it may be noted here that the literature is not consistent in observing a flattening in counts at sub - mjy flux density ; for example , the counts in @xcite and @xcite are consistent with a continuation in the slope of the differential counts below mjy flux density .",
    "potential causes for the discrepancy are that deep radio surveys often suffer from inadequate sky coverage that is necessary to average over clustering , wide - field surveys often do not go sufficiently deep and so biases arising from the proximity of the detection threshold to the image noise may distort measured counts .",
    "additional uncertainly arises from lack of understanding of the radio structures in sub - mjy radio sources , which may lead to biases related to the ability of the survey to catalog sources from detections of source components .",
    "the atlbs is a moderately wide - field radio survey , covering @xmath20 square degrees in the southern sky at @xmath21 ghz .",
    "the survey has been carried out using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , which is a fourier imaging interferometer array .",
    "the radio observations for the low - brightness survey were designed for complete u - v coverage up to @xmath22  m ( for details of these observations , see @xcite ) .",
    "the work presented herein is based on the combination of the initial low resolution survey and more recent radio observations with the atca in multiple expanded array configurations that extended the u - v coverage to @xmath23  km , giving a synthesized beam with fwhm of @xmath0 and images with rms noise @xmath24jy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "the high resolution observations are critical in better estimation of the source structures and for removing the effects of blending(source confusion ) in the low resolution survey .",
    "see @xcite for details on a sample of extended sources and classification of sources from the atlbs survey , which has been carried out using both the high resolution and low resolution images .    the improved imaging of the atlbs survey regions has been used to revisit the 1.4  ghz source counts : the survey has sufficient sensitivity to probe the sub - mjy regime , and the relatively large sky coverage avoids clustering related uncertainties .",
    "a specific improvement in this work is the care taken to identify sources with low surface brightness by making use of low resolution images , and using multiple indicators to identify components of sources .",
    "the low resolution images were used to make initial identifications so that the sources which might be resolved into multiple components at higher resolution are identified correctly .",
    "the blending issues inherent in using low resolution images have been avoided using higher resolution images to identify blends .",
    "in addition , the use of low resolution images ( beam fwhm = @xmath6 ) almost completely removes effects of resolution bias ( for a detailed discussion , see section .",
    "[ section_resolution_bias ] ) .",
    "these strategies , together with use of optical imagesto locate candidate galaxy hosts and a careful visual examination of resolved and complex sources instead of automated classification ensures that the atlbs catalog is a ` source catalog ' as opposed to a ` component catalog ' . the distinction between ` sources ' ( which are single sources ) as opposed to components ( which may be parts of a single source or unrelated sources which are close to each other due to projection effects ) is crucial in estimating the true source counts .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give details of the new high resolution radio observations of the atlbs survey regions . in section ( [ section_source_detection ] )",
    "we give details of the procedure adopted for source detection and the estimation of source flux densities . in section ( [ section_source_counts ] )",
    "we present the source counts along with the corrections necessary to derive the true counts from the observations .",
    "next , in section ( [ section_comparison ] ) , we compare the atlbs source counts with previous work .",
    "finally , in section ( [ section_conclusions ] ) , the conclusions are presented .",
    "the radio observations which form the atlbs survey were made with different array configurations of the atca .",
    "the observations were made in the @xmath25  cm band , with a center frequency of @xmath26  mhz .",
    "these observations recorded visibilities in full polarization mode .",
    "the observations were made in two sub - bands with center frequencies of @xmath27 mhz and @xmath28 mhz , with bandwidths of @xmath29  mhz .",
    "each band was covered by @xmath30 independent frequency channels of which multi - channel continuum visibilities in the 13 central channels were used .",
    "the atlbs survey covers two regions in the southern sky .",
    "these regions are designated as ` a ' and ` b ' having their centers at ra : @xmath3 , dec : @xmath31 and ra : @xmath5 , dec : @xmath31 ( j2000 epoch ) respectively .",
    "together they cover an area of @xmath20 square degrees .",
    "the two regions were specifically selected to be devoid of strong radio sources , low galactic foreground emission , and at an optimum latitude that allowed for good visibility coverage for radio observations with the atca ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "each of the regions is covered in the interferometer observations as a mosaic of @xmath32 pointings .",
    "earlier observations were made with the array configurations @xmath22a , @xmath22b , @xmath22c and @xmath22d .",
    "these configurations provided complete u - v coverage up to @xmath22 meters , and low - resolution images made with these data were presented in @xcite . to obtain good u - v coverage up to @xmath23 km antenna separations",
    ", new observations were made with the array configurations @xmath23a , @xmath23b , @xmath23c , and @xmath23d .",
    "the plan of the observations was as follows .",
    "the two regions a and b were observed for @xmath12 hours with the array configured in each of the four layouts .",
    "the total observing time was @xmath33 hours and this was spread over the mosaic pointings .",
    "each pointing was observed for @xmath25 seconds before switching to the next pointing and the pointings were thus cycled over every @xmath34 sec .",
    "the reduction and imaging of the data was done with the radio interferometer data reduction software miriad @xcite .",
    "the data was calibrated for amplitude and phase using the calibrator pks b2353 - 686 .",
    "the absolute flux scale was set using the calibrator pks b1934 - 638 .",
    "the visibility data was also examined for radio frequency interference and outliers and other obviously corrupted data were rejected .",
    "first , images were produced with the @xmath23 km configuration visibilities .",
    "deconvolution used the clark algorithm @xcite , which is faster for large images . after a phase - only self - calibration iteration ,",
    "the clean components of sources exclusively within the primary beam main lobe were selected by masking the regions outside the primary beam main lobe in the images .",
    "visibilities corresponding to these were subtracted from the data and the residual visibilities were imaged to model the sources outside the primary beam main lobe .",
    "the model was allowed to include both positive and negative intensity components since the source structures in these regions were unreal because of the significant azimuthal structure in the telescope primary beam sidelobes , which modulated the visibilities of sources outside the primary beam as the alt - azimuth antennas tracked the pointing centers over the observing session .",
    "visibility domain subtraction of this model provided a dataset containing essentially only sources inside the primary beam main lobe .",
    "next , the visibilities from the array configurations of 750  m length were reduced in a similar way to get visibilities referring only to the sources within the primary beam main lobe . following these steps ,",
    "the visibilities were all concatenated for joint imaging , deconvolution and iterative self - calibration .",
    "the imaging was done with large sidelobe suppression area to obtain a good beam .",
    "initial self calibration iterations were of phase - only type .",
    "the multi - frequency deconvolution described in @xcite was used to get the clean components from self - calibrated data . because the u , v - coverage was not complete in the 750 - 6000  m range , deconvolution was assisted by masking areas of the image where no significant intensities were present .",
    "this was done by first smoothing the image to detect most of the diffuse emission and in the smoothed image regions below @xmath35 were masked .",
    "this process was repeated , iteratively , along with phase and amplitude self calibration .",
    "the solution intervals for the successive iterations varied from @xmath36 to @xmath37 minutes . in a final step ,",
    "the images of individual pointings were regridded and stitched together to obtain the combined mosaic image of region a and b separately . the sky area covered by the by these regions",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fieldab ] .",
    "sample sub - images of these high resolution images of these regions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fielda ] and fig .",
    "[ fieldb ] . to better appreciate the difference between the high and low resolution images , we have presented a sky region in low and high resolutions in fig .",
    "[ lowres_source ] and fig .",
    "[ highres_source ] .",
    "the linear combination of pointings was done with a weighting that maintained rms noise in the images nearly uniform ; this value is @xmath24jy  beam@xmath2 . over the 8.42 square degrees sky area where the gain in the mosaic images exceeds 0.5 ( and hence the rms noise in primary beam corrected images",
    "does not exceed the above value by more than a factor of two ) there are no image errors apparent above the thermal image noise .",
    "this exceptional quality in the wide - field images makes it a useful database for automated source finding and classifying algorithms as well as reliable studies of radio source properties .",
    "in addition , the range of source morphologies makes possible the validation and developement of automated source finding algorithms , which may become crucial in the analysis of data from large surveys such as lofar and ska .",
    "we have jointly used the low and high resolution atlbs images in the strategy adopted for source detection and classification as well as for estimations of flux density .",
    "the former , with @xmath6 fwhm beam , was made using the 750-m arrays and the latter , with @xmath0 fwhm beam , was made using all of the visibilities up to 6  km baselines .",
    "the low resolution images are used to identify sky regions in which to search for source components using the high resolution images .",
    "the low resolution images have relatively lower chance of missing a source due to its being resolved : known in the literature as ` resolution bias ' , resolved sources with same integrated flux density would have relatively lower peak flux density and hence may not have image pixels above the detection threshold ; this would result in high resolution images missing such sources that may be detected in lower resolution images .",
    "the high resolution images have been used to detect source components , identify blends and classify the sources .",
    "various aspects that potentially introduce bias and errors in source detections such as the thermal noise in the images and the effects of blending - confusion have been examined , as described below .",
    "as mentioned above , we identify regions in the low resolution image which contain sources .",
    "the size of these regions , or ` footprints ' are of importance in determining the threshold for source detection , along with considerations related to the image thermal noise ( where ` thermal ' noise is the composite of the receiver noise , the sky as well as ground noise ) and source blending - confusion effects in the high resolution image .",
    "we describe here the procedure to determine the detection thresholds separately for source identification in low resolution images and for component identification in high resolution images .",
    "a source detection threshold can be derived for an image if the number of spurious sources expected above any threshold may be estimated .",
    "the latter can be calculated easily if the noise follows a gaussian distribution with a known variance .",
    "but for an image convolved with a point spread function , this would only give the total area in the image above the threshold .",
    "the actual number of spurious ` sources ' or ` islands'(connected pixels ) above the threshold would depend on the shape and size of the point spread function . above the threshold only the summits of the spurious ` sources ' might be observed , with a smaller area than that corresponding to the fwhm of the main lobe of the point spread function .",
    "therefore , the detection threshold needs to be determined taking this into account .      for the low resolution image",
    ", we employ an empirical approach towards threshold determination .",
    "since the initial noise distribution before being convolved with the point spread function is expected to be gaussian ( with a zero mean ) , we expect the number of positive noise peaks above a flux density value ( say @xmath38 ) to be the same as the number of negative noise peaks below @xmath39 .",
    "since the positive noise peaks can not be distinguished from real sources , we use the number of negative peaks to estimate the detection threshold .",
    "the number of negative peaks is affected by the area which is covered by ` sources ' at every detection threshold .",
    "this is because a negative peak occurring at the location of a source will not be detected as a negative peak in the counting .",
    "we correct for this by the ratio of total area covered by the sources above any threshold and the total image area .",
    "for example , we find @xmath40 noise peaks below @xmath41  mjy in the survey region and , after correction for the above , we estimate that there are @xmath42 spurious noise peaks below this threshold in the entire survey region including those areas covered by genuine sources .",
    "we expect very similar numbers of positive noise peaks above @xmath43  mjy in the survey region .",
    "if we assume gaussian statistics we expect only about 2 spurious sources in the entire survey region above a @xmath44 threshold ; the significantly larger number of spurious sources suggests that the image noise is non - gaussian at this level .",
    "since we find @xmath45 sources above @xmath46  mjy in the atlbs survey region , we conclude that the fraction of spurious sources at a threshold of @xmath46 mjy is @xmath47 .",
    "the percentage of spurious sources changes with the detection threshold .",
    "the percentage of spurious sources goes from @xmath48 at @xmath49  mjy to merely @xmath50 at a threshold of @xmath51  mjy .",
    "however , the number of sources which will not be detected will also rise with the threshold .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath46 mjy as our threshold for the low resolution image ( a @xmath44 threshold ) , with an expected @xmath47 of false detections .",
    "therefore the reliability of the catalog is @xmath52 at the detection threshold .",
    "the number of negative peaks might be affected by the fact that negative peaks have not been deconvolved , and they would retain the dirty beam pattern . this may give rise to negative peaks arising from the sidelobes of the beam .",
    "however , since the sidelobe level is below @xmath53 , the contribution from the sidelobes to negative peaks is not expected to affect the above analysis .",
    "it may be noted here that the above discussion does not consider the sources which have true flux density below the detection threshold but are detected above the threshold due to noise peaks biasing their intensity above the threshold .",
    "we have carried out simulations of noise bias which estimates this effect and we correct the source counts for this effect ; these corrections are discussed below in section ( [ section_source_counts ] ) .",
    "for the high resolution image , we follow a different strategy for determining the thermal noise limited detection threshold .",
    "because we only search for the high resolution peaks in the footprints of the sources detected in the low resolution images , the threshold for the detection of the high resolution peaks is determined using the footprint area in which the source components might be located and not the complete area of the image . in this way",
    ", we may make use of a unique detection threshold for each source component which would depend on the footprint area in which the source component is located .",
    "we aim to keep the number of spurious components detected in high resolution images to be one per @xmath54 footprints .",
    "since in most cases one footprint corresponds to one source detected in the high resolution image , the above criterion corresponds to a false detection rate of approximately @xmath53 .",
    "we empirically determine the mean number of pixels per negative peak by measuring the number of negative peaks and pixels at a given flux density cutoff .",
    "we find that the number of pixels per peak is @xmath55 for specifically the synthesized beam and image sampling in the high resolution atlbs image .",
    "assuming that the number of spurious positive pixels is similar to that of negative pixels , the number of spurious positive peaks can be estimated . for each footprint (",
    "in which we detect source component peaks in the high resolution image ) we choose the flux density threshold so as to keep the probability of including noise peaks as spurious source components below @xmath53 .",
    "if we choose a low threshold for identifying peaks in the high resolution image as source components , then a large number of spurious components would be considered as source components and , therefore , a large number of sources would be misclassified as multicomponent and hence complex .",
    "if we choose a high threshold , then genuine source components might be missed and sources would be misclassified as extended and resolved in the high resolution images or misclassified as unresolved when they are actually complex",
    ". however the latter misclassification is avoided by recognizing that the integrated flux density in the high resolution image falls short of that in the low resolution image and by classifying such sources as complex in these cases .",
    "misclassification of unresolved sources would happen predominantly in cases where the peak flux density is close to the rms image thermal noise . for a flux density threshold of @xmath56 ,",
    "if the probability of occurrence of spurious pixels above the threshold is @xmath57 ( the probability is determined by integrating the assumed gaussian distribution for the pixels ) , then the number of spurious source components in the footprint area is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of pixels in the footprint .",
    "since we wish to keep the number of spurious source components in each footprint less than @xmath60 , the flux density threshold is given by @xmath61 .",
    "we have used this recipe to compute the flux threshold uniquely for each footprint . as we do not directly estimate",
    "the number of spurious sources from the number of negative peaks in the image , the effect due to the sidelobes of the dirty beam , as descibed above , does not influence the detection threshold directly .",
    "the thermal noise limits discussed above along with considerations related to source blending - confusion , which are discussed next , lead to the adopted detection threshold for the atlbs survey and hence determine the error in source counts and confidence in classification .",
    "source blending - confusion ( also called source confusion in literature ) is because any telescope of finite size has only a finite angular resolution .",
    "since the synthesized beam has a finite size , this makes the detection of two distinct sources that are located close to each other difficult because the sources may appear blended with each other in the image .",
    "blending - confusion limits the flux density limit to which sources may be reliably identified distinctly in a survey , this is a limitation apart from that arising due to the image thermal noise .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for some of the earliest descriptions of this effect . in this section",
    "we describe the effects of the source blending - confusion on source detection in the atlbs survey .",
    "since thermal noise considerations suggest a source detection threshold of @xmath46 mjy for the low resolution image , we examine the source blending - confusion for this threshold to confirm that the latter are sub - dominant to the limitation arising from thermal noise .",
    "we estimate the effects of source blending - confusion for the atlbs high resolution images ( beam fwhm = @xmath0 ) using simulations , which we describe next .",
    "we assume that the flux density distribution of sources follow the source counts derived from the pds survey ( hopkins et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the simulation poisson distributed sources over a sky area corresponding to the total area imaged in the atlbs survey ( @xmath20 square degrees ) .",
    "blending - confusion causes sources to be shifted from the bin corresponding to their true flux density to a bin with higher flux density .",
    "the source counts in any given flux density bin change due to the migration of sources in and out of the bin : into the bin from lower flux density bins and out of the bin to higher flux density bins .",
    "the flux density range for the simulation was chosen to accurately model the effects of blending- confusion for our survey .",
    "the simulations allow for multiple blendings with other sources .",
    "the lower limit of the range was chosen so that the effects of the sources changing bins due to blending - confusion are reliably modeled for the bins above @xmath46 mjy , which is our detection threshold flux density .",
    "the upper limit of the range is chosen so that the brightest sources in the survey are accounted for ( in the simulation , we expect to detect only a single source in the highest flux density bin ) .",
    "additionally , the shapes of the sources in the synthesized images ( which have been restored following deconvolution ) were set to be gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath0 .",
    "the ` radius ' of each source was taken to be the distance from the source peak at which the intensity drops to half the threshold flux density .",
    "sources were counted as blends if the distance between their peaks was smaller than the sum of the radii of the two sources , since in this situation the two sources would appear to be connected by emission above the threshold flux density in the image .",
    "those sources that have peak flux density less than half the threshold flux density would appear ` blended ' if they are located within the radius of a source that has peak exceeding half the threshold flux density , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the radius of the stronger source is smaller than the distance between the peaks .",
    "an arbitrarily small radius @xmath62 is assigned to such sources , which allows for the possibility that two such sources blend together and then blend with other sources .",
    "the simulations were made with octave bin ranges from 0.1  mjy upwards , and showed that the recovered flux density distribution was not significantly altered .",
    "most blending - confusion of sources occurs at the lowest flux density bins , and the source counts remain unchanged for higher flux density bins .",
    "the number of sources migrating into a bin from lower flux density bins and the number of sources migrating out of the bin due to blending - confusion were also estimated . in the bin",
    "@xmath63 mjy the source distribution was unchanged within errors .",
    "for these and higher flux density bins , the number of sources migrating to and out of the bin matches . for sources in bins above a flux density of @xmath64 mjy",
    ", the blending - confusion effects were found to be negligible , possibly due to the relatively sparse distribution of sources above this flux density .",
    "for source counts derived herein from the atlbs , based on a detection threshold of @xmath46 mjy , the correction factors required to account for source blending - confusion is less than @xmath65 .",
    "we infer from the above analysis that the threshold for source detection in the high resolution images might be placed at or even below @xmath46 mjy , insofar as blending - confusion is concerned , while keeping the errors introduced in the source counts due to blending - confusion below @xmath66 . therefore , we may choose the detection threshold for components in the high resolution image ( within the footprint area as outlined in the previous section ) based solely on thermal noise effects in the high resolution image .",
    "we note here that it is possible that the low resolution image may have blends , which will be identified as separate sources using the high resolution image",
    ".      bandwidth smearing , which is the radio analog of chromatic aberration , arises due to averaging of visibilities over a bandwidth .",
    "the effect of the bandwidth smearing on the source is to reduce the peak flux density and to ` smear ' it around the source ; the integrated flux density is unaltered .",
    "since we make use of the peak flux density of detected sources in the classification of the sources ( described in section [ section_source_classification ] ) , in particular to differentiate between unresolved and resolved sources , the bandwidth correction needs to be applied prior to source classification .",
    "below we describe the estimation of the magnitude of this effect .    for the atlbs survey , the total bandwidth",
    "is divided into @xmath67 bands each with a useful width of @xmath68 mhz .",
    "each of these bands is further divided into @xmath69 independent channels of equal width and the data is acquired as multi - channel continuum visibilities , which thus significantly reduces the bandwidth smearing effect . to estimate the bandwidth smearing for the atlbs sources , we have carried out simulations .",
    "visibilities corresponding to unresolved sources with a flux density of @xmath70 mjy were added to data in a single pointing at different distances from the image centre .",
    "any given source in the mosaic is at a maximum distance of @xmath71 from the nearest pointing centre .",
    "we utilized the fact that bandwidth smearing depends on the product of the bandwidth and the source distance from the centre and derived estimates of bandwidth smearing within the 8  mhz bands by scaling the offset distances at which sources are added by a factor of @xmath69 and computing visibilities averaged over a band of @xmath72  mhz .",
    "the advantage of performing the above procedure is that it does not make any assumptions regarding the shape of the channel bandpass by using data from real observations used for producing the image .",
    "a polynomial fit was obtained for the attenuation as a function of distance , which is made use of to correct the measured peak flux densities .",
    "the maximum bandwidth smearing correction thus obtained is @xmath73 at a distance of @xmath71 from the nearest pointing centre .",
    "the correction factor derived above is correct for unresolved sources .",
    "the peak flux densities for resolved sources are less affected by bandwidth smearing ; the correction factors depend on the source structure .",
    "nevertheless , below we simply apply the derived correction factors to the measured peak flux densities of all sources . in the case of unresolved sources ,",
    "the correction is expected to aid correct classification ; in the case of resolved sources , the overcorrection that results from the above prescription is not expected to alter the classification .",
    "we find sources and make an initial classification using the low resolution image .",
    "the ` islands ' of pixels above a threshold of 0.38  mjy are identified in the low resolution image and these sky regions are used to estimate the source parameters in the low resolution image .",
    "the sources are classified into ( i ) unresolved sources , ( ii ) resolved single - gaussian sources and ( iii ) complex sources .",
    "a fit with gaussian models is attempted for all sources . in the case of resolved sources ,",
    "if the gaussian model fit is good , then the source is noted as a gaussian source . if the fit fails and multiple gaussian are needed to obtain a good fit to the source , then the source is flagged as a multicomponent or complex source .",
    "the final classification of the sources is made using the high resolution image that has beam fwhm of @xmath0 , which provides a better representation of the source structure .",
    "the high resolution image also helps in distinguishing sources which might be blended together in the low resolution image . for this classification step",
    "we use a method similar to that described in the previous section .",
    "unresolved sources are identified by comparing the peak flux densities in the low and high resolution images . for unresolved sources",
    ", we expect that the peak flux at high and low resolution are equal , within errors .",
    "if the peak flux in the high resolution image is higher than the peak flux in the low resolution image , we classify the source as unresolved , since this can only happen if noise increases the peak flux in high resolution image and/or lowers it in the low resolution image .",
    "if the peak flux in the high resolution image is lower , then we classify the source as a point source if it is within a @xmath74 interval of the low resolution peak .",
    "the probability of a noise peak exceeding @xmath74 is @xmath75 ; therefore , approximately @xmath76 of unresolved sources may be misclassified by this scheme . extended sources ( in the high resolution image ) might get misclassified as unresolved sources due to noise increasing the high resolution peak flux density or decreasing the peak flux density in the low resolution image so as to satisfy the above condition . however",
    ", if the source is extended in the high resolution image , then for sources in which the peak flux density is much greater than the image thermal noise the additive noise required for misclassification is large and has a very small probability associated with it .",
    "however , if the source peak flux density is close to the detection threshold and nearer the noise floor , then there is a higher chance that an extended source may get classified as an unresolved source .",
    "therefore , close to the detection threshold , discriminating between unresolved and extended sources might be incorrect .",
    "the ` footprint ' of any source is defined to be the area of its ` island ' in the low resolution image ( if the peak flux of the source in the low resolution image is not more than twice the threshold , then the footprint is redefined to be the contour at half the peak flux .",
    "this is done so that we search the high resolution image for components in at least a fwhm beam area of the low resolution image ) .",
    "the footprint is used for estimating the flux density and for component identification in the high resolution image .",
    "the integrated flux of the source is estimated by iteratively fitting gaussian models to the source and subtracting these model components till the peak residual in the footprint falls below a threshold .",

    "sources for which the noise gives a fitted diameter less than the beam are considered point sources and the peak flux density is then the optimum estimate for both the flux densities .    for sources classified as unresolved or single - component gaussians on the basis of the high resolution image , we adopt the low resolution integrated flux density as the estimator of the true integrated flux density , rather than using its counterpart from the high resolution image . it may be noted that the integrated and peak flux densities of the single component gaussians and unresolved sources are the same , within errors , in the high resolution and low resolution images .    for those sources",

    "we have , additionally , estimated the value of @xmath87 from the source counts which we have derived ; the value of the slope thus estimated is consistent with the above value of the slope over most of the flux density range .",
    "the blending correction to the counts is negligible due to the high angular resolution in our images , and it has been discussed in detail in a previous section . to assure completeness of the source counts ,",
    "we have applied resolution bias correction , effective area correction and noise bias correction ; these are discussed below .",
    "noise bias arises because the ` true ' source counts are modified by the the noise in the image .",
    "this is true for estimations of any distribution affected by additive noise @xcite ; noise bias corrections have been applied previously to radio source counts @xcite .",
    "noise in the image effectively redistributes sources across neighboring bins , the magnitude of the effect depends both on the image noise and the intrinsic source distribution .",
    "if a particular bin has nearby bins with nearly the same numbers of sources , then the number of sources migrating into the bin and out of the bin are the same , assuming symmetric noise distribution .",
    "additionally , at high flux densities , the contribution of image noise to the source flux density is small and is usually a small fraction of the bin size , which most often increases in geometric progression .",
    "therefore , the effects of noise bias are important for the lowest few bins .",
    "we have simulated the effects of noise bias for our images .",
    "we have made use of the polynomial fit to the radio source counts given by hopkins et al.(2003 ) as a model for the true source distribution ( it may be noted here that later in this paper in section 5 we derive an improved estimate of noise bias and resultant source counts using eqn .",

    "approximately @xmath99 sources above the detection threshold lie outside this area .",
    "since the primary beam gain varies over the mosaic image this leads to a bias in source detection because sources with higher peak flux densities are potentially detectable over a larger sky area .",
    "sources with peak flux density above twice the detection threshold may be detected anywhere in the area mentioned above ( since the maximum attenuation suffered would lower the peak flux densities above or at the detection threshold ) ; whereas the sources with peak flux densities between the detection threshold and twice that value would be detectable only within a restricted area . the correction factor to account for the change in effective sky area with flux density may be estimated as the ratio of the effective area for a given peak flux density and the total detection area , assuming that sources are uniformly distributed on the sky .",
    "for blended sources ( or rather those sources which are blended in the low resolution image and have been found to be multiple distinct sources at high resolution ) , the peak flux density as well as the integrated flux density have been determined using the high resolution image .",
    "an effective area correction derived from the low resolution peak flux density may be incorrect in these cases because in many such cases sources with a large difference in peak flux density are blended together .",
    "blended sources with individual peak flux densities above the detection threshold would have all been detected irrespective of blending . for these sources we use the high resolution integrated flux density to derive the effective area correction .",

    "we have demonstrated the substantial difference in counts that results from using component catalogs as opposed to source catalogs : at 1  mjy flux density component counts may be as much as 50% above true source counts .",
    "this implies that automated image analysis for counts may be dependent on the ability of the imaging to reproduce connecting emission with low surface brightness and on the ability of the algorithm to recognize sources , which may require that source finding algorithms effectively work with multi - resolution and multi - wavelength data .",
    "the work presented herein underscores the importance of noise bias correction , in particular for deriving counts close to the limit of the survey sensitivity and for correctly estimating the faint end slope and upturn in the source counts at sub - mjy flux density .",
    "finally , the lack of an upturn in the source counts at faint flux densities implies that down to the faintest flux densities we have probed ( approximately 0.4 mjy ) there is no evidence for any new population .",
    "the upturn reported in the literature may be due to a combination of small survey areas and identification of radio sources as opposed to components , as well as effects of noise bias close to the detection limit .",
    "the atca is part of the australia telescope , which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "we thank anant tanna for his assistance with the initial processing of the visibility data .",
