    "the understanding of the prominence formation is strongly connected with the knowledge of the magnetic fields which are responsible for their support .",
    "polarimetric observations of the emission lines in prominences allow to study the structure and intensity of their magnetic fields through the hanle and the zeeman effect . after the extensive measurements of and , in the last two decades the observational activity in this domain was rather poor .",
    "on the other hand the progress in the instrumentation improved remarkably the polarimetric sensitivities that can now be achieved .",
    "recently , new polarimetric observations of few prominences were reported ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we proceed to a more extended observational program .",
    "the evacuated gregory - coud telescope which is used at irsol ( istituto ricerche solari locarno ) , has the advantage to introduce small instrumental polarization and cross - talks @xcite .",
    "both are generated mainly from two off - axis flat mirrors , whose effects theoretically cancel out around the equinox . otherwise they increase almost linearly with declination and stay almost constant over one day of solar observations . at solstice",
    "the total instrumental linear polarization reaches almost 3% and the circular polarization is smaller than 1% .",
    "19 prominences were observed from 24th march to 24th april 2003 using the beam exchange technique proposed by .",
    "this technique allows a measurement free from effects introduced by the detector gain table .",
    "the data reduction technique and the instrumental set - up are described by . for each prominence we took various sets of measurements at different locations and times .",
    "each set included typically about 20 exposures of 5 seconds each on a fixed position on the prominences , from which all four stokes components were extracted .",
    "a second observation series was performed using the zurich imaging polarimeter zimpolii @xcite , which allows to get polarization measurements free from seeing effects .",
    "16 prominences were observed from 22nd may to 26th september 2003 .",
    "the image was rotated with a dove prism set after the analyzer in order to keep the limb parallel to the spectrograph slit .",
    "various sets of measurements were taken at different locations .",
    "each set included typically 100 images of 10 seconds exposure each .    in both observing techniques additional measurements",
    "were regularly performed for calibration purposes .",
    "the light originating at center of the solar disc was assumed to be unpolarized and therefore used as reference to establish the correction for the instrumental polarization .",
    "the background intensity profile was determined observing a quiet region of the halo near the prominence .",
    "we sometimes measured a nonzero polarization in the background light in a particular region ( ne ) above the solar limb ( values up to 7% ) .",
    "this is believed to come from spurious reflections within the telescope .",
    "the full stokes vector of the background light was therefore subtracted from the total measured stokes vector .    in order to account for the cross - talk from the linear polarization to the circular polarization ( values up to about 20% at solstice ) measurements",
    "were performed applying a linear polarization filter in different positions before the entrance window of the telescope .",
    "the cross - talk from the circular to the linear polarization was not taken into account since it was expected to be negligible .",
    "an example of the four stokes spectral images resulting from the measurement of one prominence with the zimpolii system is reported to the left in fig .",
    "[ stokes ] .    in this preliminary analysis",
    "we look at the spectro - polarimetric profiles obtained integrating over the spatial region where the signal intensity is at least 50% of the maximum intensity .",
    "the profiles of stokes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 divided by @xmath4 ( the maximum of the intensity profile ) are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ stokes ] .",
    "two resolved multiplet components can be observed : a strong blue component at 5875.6   and a faint red component at 5875.97  . to analyze the behavior of the two components we average the value of the relative polarization in the intervals 5875.5 - 5875.7   respectively 5875.9 - 5876.0  .",
    "it is found that usually @xmath5 is about a factor of two larger in the faint component than in the strong component , as can be observed in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ sumgraph ] . in the right panel",
    "we show indeed for the strong component the hanle diagram , where the total linear polarization versus the rotation angle @xmath6 is plotted .",
    "the results obtained with the two techniques for different prominences are similar .",
    "the instrumentation at irsol and the two techniques used allowed precise measurements of the profiles of all four stokes components in the hei - d@xmath0 emission line of 35 prominences .",
    "@xmath5 was found to be always positive with values up to 7% in the faint red multiplet component and up to 3% in the blue component .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 were generally below 2% and 0.5% respectively .",
    "we thank prof .",
