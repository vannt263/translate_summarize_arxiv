    "materials exhibiting the giant magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) have demonstrated potential for advancing magnetic refrigeration , an energy - efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional refrigeration @xcite .",
    "historically , magnetic refrigerants have been used only for very specific applications at very low temperatures , and in most cases , the entropy changes were small @xcite .",
    "in fact , the largest values of the mce were encountered in the vicinity of a second - order magnetic transition in gd @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the giant mce in gd@xmath5(si@xmath6ge@xmath7)@xmath8 has opened the door for highly efficient magnetic refrigeration near room temperature @xcite . however , with the currently available magnetic materials , this high efficiency is only realized in high magnetic fields .",
    "nanostructuring is a promising route to perturb properties , and may lead to novel and advantageous magnetocaloric properties using existing materials @xcite . as gd is traditionally the standard by which all magnetocaloric materials are measured , we have begun investigating the impact of nanostructuring using gd thin films , specifically in gd / w thin film heterostructures .",
    "magnetron sputtering was used with ultra high purity ( uhp , 99.999% ) argon gas to deposit w(50  @xmath0)/[gd(400  @xmath0)/w(50  @xmath0)]@xmath1 multilayers onto mgo ( 100 ) substrates at ambient temperature in an all - stainless system whose base pressure is 20  ntorr .",
    "prior to deposition , the mgo substrate surface was modestly milled with 50  w rf biasing in 10  mtorr uhp ar for ten minutes , and the sputtering targets , 99.95% w and 99.95% ( rare earth equivalent ) gd , were presputtered under deposition conditions for ten minutes .",
    "in addition to cleaning the target surface , presputtering the gd serves to getter background gases from the chamber , causing the base pressure to fall by an order of magnitude .",
    "the deposition parameters were 3  mtorr uhp ar flowing at 20 standard cubic centimeters per minute ( sccm ) and 100  w of dc power for w , 100  w rf for gd .",
    "rate calibrations of samples grown under these conditions were performed on thicker films using x - ray reflectivity ; the deposition rates were 0.71  @xmath9 for w and 1.20  @xmath9 for gd .",
    "the sample was _ in situ _ annealed at 600  @xmath10c for one hour after deposition was complete , which is known to improve interface quality @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction for @xmath11 in the range 20 - 70@xmath12 reveals and strong gd ( 10@xmath130 ) and ( 0001 ) peaks ( higher order peaks of these are also present ) .",
    "a simple scherrer grain size analysis indicates that the gd layers are structurally coherent throughout their thickness .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed using a quantum design physical property measurement system .",
    "the magnetization isotherms were measured in the range of 03  t for temperatures of 260320  k in steps of 10  k. the change in the entropy ( @xmath14 ) of a magnetic material in an applied magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) is related to the change in magnetization ( @xmath16 ) with respect to the temperature ( @xmath17 ) through the thermodynamic maxwell relation : @xmath18 for data taken at discrete field and temperature intervals , the change in magnetic entropy , @xmath19 , due to an applied field from 0 to @xmath20 can be approximated as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the permeability of free space .",
    "figure  [ entropy ] shows the magnetic entropy change measured for the w(50  @xmath0)/[gd(400  @xmath0)/w(50  @xmath0)]@xmath1 multilayer ( sample area was 1  @xmath23 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 peak for low fields is around 284  k , consistent with @xmath25 as determined by the kovel - fisher method below @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the peak is about 3.4  j / kg - k , about one third of the value for bulk gd @xcite .",
    "the shift of the peak with maximum field is approximately linear in the field range studied , with a slope of about 0.16  k / koe .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of the temperature dependence of @xmath24 is that its temperature full width at half max @xmath26 is nearly double that of bulk gd under similar field conditions .",
    "in fact , the @xmath26 observed for @xmath27 30  koe exceeds that of bulk gd for @xmath27 50  koe . while this is compensated for by a reduction of the @xmath24 peak value ,",
    "the relative cooling power calculated as @xmath28 @xcite is 240  j / kg , which is on the order of that for bulk gd ( 410  j / kg ) .",
    "this may indicate that nanostructuring is a potential route for developing magnetic refrigerants with large useful temperature ranges .",
    "an iterative kouvel - fisher method was used to determine the critical exponents and curie temperature of the system @xcite .",
    "this approach has been quite successful for analyzing amorphous magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the data were initially analyzed on a modified arrott - noakes plot , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the high field portions ( @xmath32 ) of each isothermal data set were extrapolated to determine the @xmath33 and @xmath34 intercepts with second order polynomials @xcite , which allows us to determine the spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath35 ) and the inverse of the initial susceptibility ( @xmath36 ) , respectively .",
    "the slopes of the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 near @xmath25 are taken as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the initial exponents , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , led to nonlinear @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; second order polynomials fit these functions well , and were used to estimate @xmath43 and @xmath44 near @xmath25 .",
    "these exponents were then used to create a new modified arrott - noakes plot ( @xmath45 ) , thus beginning another iteration of this process .",
    "the data were analyzed in this fashion for four iterations at which point the exponents were unchanging ( @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the convergent exponents were determined to be @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ exponents ] shows that the final @xmath41 and @xmath42 obtained by following this procedure are linear on either side of the second order phase transition ; the inset shows the values of the two exponents after each iteration .",
    "interestingly , the curie temperature was relatively insensitive to this iterative process , ranging from 282  k to 284  k for each iteration .",
    "this curie temperature is reduced from that of bulk gd , which is consistent with finite size effects in gd thin films @xcite .",
    "figure  [ makf ] shows the final modified arrott - noakes plot using the exponents @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the origin of the enhanced @xmath26 of the entropy change is currently under investigation .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath4 determined above to be 1.75 is consistent with the two - dimensional ising model , potentially suggesting the origin may be related to a change in dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the suppressed curie temperature of the gd does indicate conclusively that finite size effects are playing a significant role in the system , further lending some credence to this possibility .",
    "another potential origin of the enhanced @xmath26 , as well as the reduced entropy change peak value , is a distribution of curie temperatures within the gd .",
    "such a situation could arise , for instance , if the curie temperature were suppressed near the gd / w interfaces .",
    "indeed , the interfacial interaction between fe and gd in fe / gd superlattices causes the gd moments near the interfaces to exhibit ferromagnetic order above the bulk curie temperature and with a magnetic moment exceeding that of bulk gd @xcite .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that the curie temperature would be suppressed at the gd - w interface .",
    "an investigation of this sort will likely require depth profiling by polarized neutron reflectometry @xcite .",
    "we have investigated gd / w multilayers in the context of the magnetocaloric effect .",
    "it is clear that nanostructuring gd significantly impacts the behavior of this material .",
    "relative to bulk gd , 400  @xmath0 thick gd films have a reduced entropy change peak value and enhanced entropy change full width at half maximum .",
    "a reduced curie temperature and susceptibility exponent @xmath4 of 1.75 suggest that finite size effects are impacting the transition , and may be related to the departure of the magnetic entropy change behavior in thin films from that of bulk material .",
