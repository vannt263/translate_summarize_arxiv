    "the origin of the accelerated expansion of the universe , first described in @xcite , is certainly the most challenging problem of modern cosmology , receiving considerable attention today in both theoretical and observational areas @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation is a cosmological constant @xmath1 in einstein s equations which remained the favored option until today and led to the @xmath1cdm model which also plays the role of a reference model for most studies in the field .",
    "such a constant is usually associated to the energy density of quantum vacuum fluctuations . because of the cosmological constant problem in its different facets , including the coincidence problem , a great deal of work was devoted to alternative approaches in which a similar dynamics as that of the @xmath1cdm model is reproduced with a time varying cosmological term , i.e. , the cosmological constant is dynamiz ed .",
    "so far , the vacuum energy is not well determined by quantum field theories in curved space - time , given the divergences involved in its derivation .",
    "for the well - established renormalization method in the case of free conformal fields in an early de sitter space - time @xcite the resulting energy density is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hubble parameter .",
    "but its value today is very small as compared to the observed @xmath1 .",
    "a correct order of magnitude is obtained for a dependence @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this circumstance gave rise to holographic dark - energy models ( see , e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "further semi - phenomenological anstze for a time - dependent cosmology term can be found in the literature @xcite . among them",
    "there is the proposal that the qcd vacuum condensate associated to the chiral phase transition leads to a vacuum density proportional to @xmath3 @xcite , more precisely @xmath5 , where @xmath6mev is the energy scale of the qcd phase transition .",
    "it is this approach that we are interested in in the present paper .",
    "the corresponding cosmological model is qualitatively similar to the standard one ( the @xmath1cdm model ) , with a radiation phase followed by a phase dominated by matter and , subsequently , by the cosmological term @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the time variation of the cosmological term is concomitant with a process of matter production in order to assure the conservation of the total energy . in this sense ,",
    "the model may be seen as a particular case of interacting dark - energy models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 model has been tested from the observational viewpoint at both the background and perturbation levels . a preliminary joint analysis of the redshift - distance relation for supernovas of type ia , the baryonic acoustic oscillations and the position of the first peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background was performed in @xcite , resulting in a present matter density parameter @xmath8 . at the perturbation level ,",
    "the matter power spectrum has been calculated by assuming that the interacting cosmological term is strictly homogeneous @xcite .",
    "this spectrum reproduced the data for an even higher matter density parameter , @xmath9 .    in the present paper",
    "we try to clarify the situation by reconsidering the previous analysis in a gauge - invariant setting .",
    "this allows us to understand the role of non - adiabatic perturbations in decaying vacuum cosmology . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the dynamically most relevant components , namely dark matter and dark energy , i.e. , we neglect both the baryon and the radiation components . we demonstrate that the entire two - component perturbation dynamics can be reduced to a single second - order perturbation equation for the density contrast of non - relativistic matter .",
    "we show also that at high redshifts the non - adiabaticity of the model is small , although non - vanishing , which allows us to use adiabatic initial conditions as a good approximation . in particular , we address the problem of the relevance of perturbations of the dark energy component for structure formation . in many investigations",
    "it is assumed from the outset that dark energy does not cluster on small scales . but strictly speaking , this has to be justified on a case - by - case basis for all dynamical dark energy models . as it was argued by park et al .",
    "@xcite , neglecting the perturbations of the dark energy component may lead to inconsistencies and unreliable conclusions concerning the interpretation of observational data . for the present model of a decaying cosmological term , however , we shall show explicitly that the dark - energy fluctuations are indeed smaller than the dark - matter fluctuations by several orders of magnitude on scales that are relevant for structure formation .",
    "this justifies _ a posteriori _ the already mentioned previous analysis in which fluctuations of the dark energy component were not taken into account @xcite and which was compatible with a value of @xmath9 for the matter density parameter .",
    "this value is considerably higher than the corresponding @xmath1cdm - value and also higher than the background concordance value obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , an update of the background tests with the most recent surveys of type ia - supernovae seems to admit matter density parameter up to this value , at least for some of the data sets @xcite .",
    "on superhorizon scales the fluctuations of the dark energy contribute a larger fraction to the total energy density perturbation but still remain smaller than the matter fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ a two - component fluid ] we introduce the general expressions for our interacting two - component fluid , obtain the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics of the model and perform a detailed analysis of the interaction term . in section [ perturbation dynamics ]",
    "we derive the central second - order equation for the matter perturbations in terms of which we also determine the perturbations of the dark - energy component .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the non - adiabatic nature of the fluctuations and show that the non - adiabaticity is negligible at early times .",
    "section [ the power spectrum ] presents the results of a numerical analysis which quantifies the role of perturbations of the dark - energy component .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions and remarks .",

    "although the perturbation @xmath146 in ( [ deltax ] ) is different from zero for @xmath177 , it does not contribute to the total energy density perturbation since the background density of the @xmath152 component vanishes ( see relation ( [ tot ] ) below ) .",

    "iii ) a separately conserved baryon component with a fixed relative density was included in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the dark - matter density parameter could not vary in the entire interval [ 0,1 ] , which led to some numerical difficulties . in the present gauge invariant treatment on the other hand ,",

    "the two - component linear scalar perturbation dynamics was reduced to a single , second - order equation for the gauge - invariantly defined , comoving fractional density contrast of the dark matter component .",
    "thanks to the specific coupling between the components , the dark - energy perturbation is determined by a combination of the dark - matter perturbation and its first time derivative .",

    "<S> we investigate a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker cosmology in which a decaying vacuum term causes matter production at late times . assuming a decay proportional to the hubble rate , the ratio of the background energy densities of dark matter and dark energy changes with the cosmic scale factor as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsically non - adiabatic two - component perturbation dynamics of this model is reduced to a single second - order equation . </S>",
    "<S> perturbations of the vacuum term are shown to be negligible on scales that are relevant for structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> on larger scales , dark - energy perturbations give a somewhat higher contribution but remain always smaller than the dark - matter perturbations . </S>"
