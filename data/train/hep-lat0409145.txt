    "it is well known that qcd in principle has a @xmath0 term .",
    "the @xmath0 term is deeply associated with non - perturbative properties of qcd at low energy and provides us with interesting issues such as the strong cp problem , possibilities of rich phase structures in @xmath0 space and so on .",
    "so it is a challenging subject to investigate the dynamics of qcd with the @xmath0 term .",
    "the @xmath0 term in lattice field theory makes the boltzmann weight complex and prevents one from performing monte carlo ( mc ) simulations directly .",
    "this is the sign problem .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by fourier - transforming the topological charge distribution@xcite @xmath4_q\\;e^{-s(\\phi ) } }    { \\int{\\cal d}\\phi\\;e^{-s(\\phi)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are the topological charge , a field of the system and an action , respectively .",
    "the measure @xmath6_q$ ] implies that the integral is restricted to configurations of @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the partition function is given in terms of @xmath1 by @xmath9    although this method works well for small volumes , it does not work for large ones because errors of @xmath1 affect strongly the behavior of the free energy density , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a volume ) .",
    "this is called flattening@xcite .",
    "flattening can be remedied by reducing the errors , but this is hopeless , because exponentially increasing statistics are needed as volume increases .    in order to deal with flattening ,",
    "we have utilized the maximum entropy method ( mem)@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we applied the mem to mock data of the gaussian @xmath1 to study whether the mem is effective to our issue . in the non - flattening case",
    ", the mem reproduces the exact @xmath2 , while it gives smooth @xmath2 in the case where flattening occurs in the fourier method . in the present work , as the next step , we apply the mem to mc data of the cp@xmath12 model , which has several dynamical properties in common with qcd .",
    "we simulated the cp@xmath3 model with a fixed point action at a fixed coupling constant , @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the lattice extension @xmath14 is changed from 4 to 96 .",
    "the statistics are more than 1 million for each case .     of the mc data of the cp@xmath3 model .",

    "the fourier transform works , but @xmath15 for @xmath17 and 56 can not be calculated properly . especially for @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath15 becomes flat for @xmath19 .",
    "this is nothing but flattening .",
    "the density @xmath15 for @xmath17 breaks down for @xmath20 due to the negative values of @xmath21 .",
    "we also call it flattening because errors of @xmath1 disturb the behavior of @xmath15 .    in order to deal with flattening ,",
    "we employ the mem . to this end",
    ", we utilize the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the mem is based on bayes theorem and gives the most probable image of @xmath2 . in our case ,",
    "the most important object is the posterior probability @xmath22 which is the probability that @xmath2 is realized when the mc data of @xmath23 and information @xmath24 are given .",
    "information @xmath24 represents our state of knowledge about @xmath2 .",
    "here we impose the criterion @xmath25 .",

    "conventionally the shannon - jaynes entropy is employed ; @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is called the default model and is chosen so as to be consistent with information @xmath24 . to sum up",
    ", our task is to calculate the most probable image @xmath33 such that @xmath34 is maximized ( see refs.@xcite for details ) .",

    "the results of the mem reproduce smooth @xmath50 in the whole @xmath0 region .",
    "for @xmath51 they depend on the default models and give no definite solution about the behavior of @xmath2 for @xmath52 due to the large magnitude of the errors . for @xmath53 , however , the results of the mem show no @xmath32-dependence and their errors are small .",
    "we thus obtain a reasonably good solution of @xmath2 for @xmath17 up to @xmath54 , which is wider than the valid region of the fourier method .",
    "we applied the mem to the mc data of the cp@xmath3 model for various volumes .",

    "the following subjects remain to be investigated ; ( i ) a systematic study of the @xmath32-dependence of @xmath33 and its error , ( ii ) investigation on a question whether the mem is more effective than the fourier method , and ( iii ) a study of the feasibility of distinction between flattening and the signal of a first order phase transition@xcite .",
