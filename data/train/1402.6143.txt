    "after the discovery of non - zero @xmath1 in latest reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments , the neutrino mass hierarchy ( i.e. , the sign of @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) and lepton cp violation are the remaining oscillation parameters to be measured in the near future .",
    "the methods of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy ( mh ) include the matter - induced oscillations in the long - baseline accelerator neutrino experiments @xcite and atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite , and the vacuum oscillations in the medium baseline reactor antineutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ( juno ) is a multipurpose liquid scintillator ( ls ) neutrino experiment , whose primary goal @xcite is to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy using reactor antineutrino oscillations .",
    "the layout of juno is shown in fig .",

    "is required to be larger than 700 meters in order to reduce the muon - induced backgrounds .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     to obtain an unprecedent energy resolution level of @xmath4 ( or 1,200 photon electrons per mev ) is a big challenge for a ls detector of 20 kton .",
    "much better performance for pmts and ls is required .",
    "r@xmath0d efforts to overcome the above challenges are being developed within the juno working groups .",
    "a new type @xcite of low - cost high - efficiency pmts is being designed , which uses the micro channel plate ( mcp ) as the dynode and receives both the transmission and reflection light using the reflection photocathode .",
    "a coverage level of @xmath5 can be realized with a careful consideration of the pmts spacing and arrangement .",
    "moreover , highly transparent ls with longer attenuation length ( @xmath630 m ) is also being developed .",
    "both the method of ls purification by using @xmath7 and the distillation facility and the method to increase the light yield are considered .",
    "juno is designed to determine the neutrino mh ( @xmath8 for six years ) and measure three of the oscillation parameters better than @xmath9 using reactor antineutrino oscillations .",
    "it can also detect the neutrino sources from astrophysics and geophysics .",
