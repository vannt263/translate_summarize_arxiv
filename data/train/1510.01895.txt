    "a defining feature of superfluids is the absence of excitations when the flow ( relative to some obstacle or boundary ) is slower than a critical velocity ; above this velocity , the flow becomes dissipative .",

    "the motion of an obstacle in the zero - temperature bose gas , described by the gross - pitaevskii equation , is a well - studied problem , particularly for circular obstacles in 2d geometries .",
    "the pioneering simulations by frisch _",
    "_ @xcite of an impenetrable circular obstacle moving within the 2d nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , demonstrated the existence of a critical velocity of value @xmath4 above which vortex - antivortex pairs are nucleated .",
    "for small obstacles , boundary effects tend to suppress vortex nucleation , and , as the obstacle s size increases , the critical velocity reduces towards an asymptotic value @xcite .",
    "the critical velocity also depends on the shape of the obstacle , for example , obstacles with elliptical cross - section lead to reduced / heightened @xmath5 , depending on the orientation relative to the flow @xcite .",

    "<S> modify the vortex nucleation from the obstacle , turning anti - parallel vortex lines ( which would be nucleated at zero temperature ) into wiggly lines , vortex rings and even vortex tangles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the critical velocity for vortex nucleation decreases with increasing temperature , and scales with the speed of sound of the condensate , becoming zero at the critical temperature for condensation . </S>"
