    "it is well known that the classical concept of space and time breaks down at very short distances ( at the order of the planck length ) .",
    "one of the ideas which have been put forward to circumvent this problem is to generalize space - time to non - commutative spaces , the simplest one being the flat ( groenewold-)moyal space ",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for an introduction .",
    "the latter is characterized by the commutation relation @xmath1}&={{\\rm i}}{\\theta}^{{\\mu}{\\nu}}\\id \\ , , \\label{eq : basic - comm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2const .",
    ", i.e. the space - time coordinates @xmath3 are promoted to operators @xmath4 which act on a hilbert space and which fulfill a heisenberg - type algebra . the commutation relation ( [ eq : basic - comm ] )",
    "is invariant under translations of the space - time coordinates and under the so - called reduced lorentz transformations ( or reduced orthogonal transformations in the euclidean setting ) , i.e. lorentz transformation matrices which commute with the constant tensor @xmath5 , e.g. see reference  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , quantum field theories formulated on such spaces suffer from new types of infrared divergences which are related to the ultraviolet divergences of the model and which can not be removed by the introduction of masses .",
    "this complication which is referred to as the _ uv / ir mixing problem _ implies that the familiar models like the @xmath6-theory are non - renormalizable when written on moyal space  @xcite . in recent years",
    "it could be shown that this problem can be overcome for the @xmath6-theory in euclidean moyal space by introducing specific additional terms into the action - theory for which there has been some recent progress ( see for instance reference  @xcite ) , but which we will not discuss here . ] .",
    "thus , the harmonic model introduced by grosse and wulkenhaar  @xcite or the @xmath7-model devised by gurau , magnen , rivasseau and tanasa  @xcite could be proven to be renormalizable by using the methods of multi - scale analysis .",
    "several models for gauge field theories on non - commutative space have also been proposed and discussed  @xcite , but so far their renormalizability could not be established . in fact , the methods considered for scalar field theories such as the multi - scale analysis can not be applied , or at least not without some serious complications , since these methods break the gauge symmetry . for commutative quantum field theories ( qfts ) ,",
    "the approach of algebraic renormalization  @xcite is a powerful tool for proving the renormalizability of models featuring symmetries .",
    "however , the standard formulation of this approach only applies to local field theories . since non - commutative qfts are non - local , the method of algebraic renormalization can not be used unless it is adapted / generalized to the particular non - localities appearing in the non - commutative case .",
    "although this task is far from being trivial , the present paper aims to provide some steps in this direction .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : qap ] , we briefly review the quantum action principle ( qap ) in commutative field theory and then we check its validity at the lowest order of perturbation theory for a @xmath8-theory on non - commutative minkowski space ( section  [ sec : nc - scalar ] ) . the second topic we address is the application of bphz subtraction and renormalization scheme to field theory on non - commutative euclidean space ( section  [ sec : bphz - nc ] ) . the nature of non - localities in non - commutative models is analyzed in section  [ sec : locality ] before considering the approach of algebraic renormalization to a complex scalar field theory with a rigid @xmath9 symmetry in section  [ sec : ar - nc ] .",
    "when discussing different aspects of the renormalization of non - commutative qfts , it is useful to have in mind the specific models which have been considered and the results which have been established concerning their renormalizability .",

    "in this paper we have shown the validity of the qap at the lowest orders of perturbation theory for the case of a scalar field theory on non - commutative minkowski space .",
    "we did not encounter potential obstructions or inconsistencies brought about the non - commutativity .",
    "accordingly , we expect the qap to hold in general for renormalizable models , but a complete proof still remains to be elaborated .    in the sequel , we have discussed the difficulties that one encounters when applying the usual bphz approach to field theories on non - commutative euclidean space . in the commutative case , the usual bphz subtraction scheme together with zimmermann s forest formula  @xcite iteratively solves all problems raised by multi - loop graphs with overlapping divergences . for the non - commutative case ,",
    "we have put forward a procedure to remedy these problems and we have explicitly shown that our strategy works at the one - loop level .",
    "this result , which was not obvious a priori , represents a crucial first step towards the definition of a complete and consistent scheme . at higher - loop order ,",
    "overlapping divergences represent a delicate issue for the renormalization and in non - commutative field theories the uv / ir mixing is at the origin of potential ir divergences . as discussed in section  [ sec : bphz - nc ] , the uv / ir mixing problem is overcome by the inclusion of the @xmath7-term into the action .",
    "we will report elsewhere  @xcite on higher - loop results obtained by application of our substraction scheme and in particular on the consistent treatment of so - called sunset graph which is a typical two - loop graph with an overlapping divergence .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the nature of non - localities which can appear in typical non - commutative field theories and we applied the method of algebraic renormalization while taking into account these non - localities .",
    "we hope that this program can be further completed so as to be applied to non - commutative gauge field theories whose renormalizability represents an outstanding problem .",
