    "it has been already almost @xmath6 years since the phenomenon of counter - rotation in disc galaxies was discovered @xcite , but both the exact incidence and the origin of counter - rotating gas and stars remain to be clarified .",
    "most statistical studies indicate that roughly @xmath6@xmath7 of all lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies with detected ionized - gas ( usually observed through optical emission lines ) contain a non - negligible fraction of gas - stars counter - rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , typically in the central regions .",
    "the fraction is much lower in later type systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably because co - rotating and counter - rotating gas can not coexist at a given radius .",
    "galaxies with counter - rotating h@xmath8i or co gas are also known ( e.g.ngc  4826 , @xcite ; ngc  3626 , @xcite ) , but to our knowledge no sound statistics exists .",
    "the fraction of s0s with stars - stars counter - rotation is also much lower ( at most @xmath9 but perhaps lower ; @xcite ) , perhaps due to the increased difficulty of detecting small numbers of counter - rotating stars .",
    "generally , however , the number of objects on which well - defined studies are based is still rather small , and it is still the case that most known counter - rotators were discovered fortuitously in targeted studies ( e.g.  ngc  4546 , @xcite ; ngc  4138 , @xcite ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is thus to improve the ( ionized - gas ) counter - rotation statistics in s0 galaxies and summarize the current situation .",
    "since counter - rotating material is a strong argument in favour of hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios , this is an important goal . in the interest of conciseness",
    ", we do not discuss here the issue of counter - rotation in elliptical galaxies , although it is probably related ( see @xcite and @xcite for general reviews of galaxies with misaligned angular momenta ) .    in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    ", we describe gas and stellar kinematics observations of a large sample of edge - on disc galaxies .",
    "the structure , kinematics , and environment of @xmath10 newly discovered ionized - gas counter - rotators and @xmath11 known object are discussed in detail in section  [ sec : galaxies ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we quantify the incidence of counter - rotators using all available observations and discuss their possible origin through continuous gas infall and/or discrete gas and satellites accretion .",
    "applications of gas counter - rotators to barred galaxy dynamics are also discussed .",
    "we conclude briefly in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath0 edge - on disc galaxies from the catalogs of galaxies with a boxy or peanut - shaped ( b / ps ) bulge of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and from the catalog of galaxies with an extreme axial ratio of @xcite . @xmath12",
    "have a b / ps bulge and roughly three - quarters either have probable companions or are part of a group or cluster , although some are probably chance alignments so the sample is not biased either against or for galaxies in a dense environment .",
    "we warn that the usual morphological classification into hubble type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is uncertain for edge - on galaxies , since the bulge - to - disc ratio is effectively the only usable criterion .",
    "the observations from the double beam spectrograph on the 2.3-m telescope at siding spring observatory were already discussed elsewhere .",
    "the red arm of the spectrograph , used to study the ionized - gas kinematics of the sample galaxies @xcite , was centred on the h@xmath13 @xmath14 emission line , covering roughly @xmath15    with a spectral resolution of @xmath16  (@xmath17  km  s@xmath18 ) .",

    "the low fraction of counter - rotators in intermediate and late - type spirals in this and the above study probably simply reflects again the fact that , in those systems , the counter - rotating gas is swept away by the dominant co - rotating one ( independently of its origin ) .",
    "in the current work , we detect @xmath24 galaxies with counter - rotating ionized - gas in a sample of @xmath0 objects .",
    "this represents @xmath1 of the entire sample , but the objects cover the morphological types s0sbc rather inhomogeneously , as they were primarily selected to cover a wide range of b / ps bulge morphologies . if we restrict ourselves to the objets classified as s0s in ned , the sample decreases to @xmath81 but the @xmath24 counter - rotating objects remain .",
    "they thus represent a fraction of @xmath2 of all the s0s , or @xmath3 of those where ionized - gas was detected .",
    "those fractions are slightly higher than the aforementioned studies , presumably because of the better quality of the data , but they are consistent within the errors .    merging the @xmath82 samples discussed above , and keeping only galaxies currently classified as s0s in ned , we obtain a sample of @xmath83 objects . correcting obvious kinematic mistakes from the recent literature , but _ not _ carrying out a full literature search for each object , we find that @xmath84 of those do not have detectable ionized - gas . of the @xmath85 objects that do ,",
    "it is counter - rotating in @xmath81 .",
    "the fraction of objects with counter - rotating ionized - gas is thus @xmath4 for the entire s0 sample , or @xmath5 for the objects with detected ionized - gas only .",
    "those fractions are again consistent with previous studies , but the errors have shrunk significantly .",
    "external gas acquired by a disc galaxy will generally settle in the equatorial plane , but it can also settle in the meridional one , forming a polar - ring or polar - disc structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once equilibrium has been reached , those configurations lead to co- or counter - rotating and perpendicular kinematics , respectively .",
    "although the ( normalised ) cold and warm gas content of polar - rings is much higher than that of counter - rotators ( the latter being similar to normal galaxies ) , this probably reflect different dynamical evolutions rather than different origins ( i.e.massive self - gravitating polar - rings can be stable ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied the environment of polar - ring galaxies and found it to be normal , in the sense of the closeness , size , and likelihood of interaction with nearby objects .",
    "interestingly , there is at least one similarly - sized companion near almost all objects .",
    "an analogous study of galaxies with counter - rotating gas or stars by @xcite ( who also considered the local density of galaxies on different spatial scales ) finds similar results . while , superficially , this seems to indicate that counter - rotating material does not originate from recent interactions",
    ", it may also simply indicate that counter - rotation develops in rather standard conditions , and that the specific characteristics leading to counter - rotation ( e.g.  specific orbital configurations ) are not captured by the coarse parameters considered .    from the ionized - gas statistics discussed above ,",
    "external gas accretion is clearly a widespread phenomenom in s0 galaxies .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached from an analysis of their neutral hydrogen ( h@xmath8i ) and dust content ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the question remains , however , whether the external gas is accreted slowly and continuously ( gas infall ) or sporadically in lumps ( minor interactions and mergers ) .",
    "using numerical simulations , @xcite argue that gas infall is best suited for the creation of _ massive _ counter - rotating discs in spirals . indeed , as long as it is not too clumpy and its infall rate is not too high , infalling gas will not unreasonably disturb and thicken the pre - existing galactic disc , while its angular momentum will determine the scalelength and formation time - scale of the counter - rotating disc .",
    "furthermore , the clumpier the infalling gas , the smaller the counter - rotating disc ( due to dynamical friction ) .    for a successful merging scenario ,",
    "the satellite galaxy should be significantly less massive and dense than the host , otherwise a more spheroidal system will emerge and/or the disc will significantly thicken ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this is ill - suited for the formation of _ massive _ counter - rotating discs ( as the merging time - scale is long and many such events are required to build up the mass ; see , again , @xcite ) , it is probably befitting for the formation of the majority of counter - rotating discs which are spatially limited and thus ( presumably ) rather light , especially if the merging satellites are gas dominated .",
    "we do not separate here between events where the satellite galaxies actually merge and events where simple tidally - induced transfers of material take place , since those are of a similar nature .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that tidally - induced gas accretion without merging is easier to reconcile with the requirement of keeping the host galaxy disc cold .",
    "based on numerical simulations , @xcite also argue in favor of accretion rather than merging in the case of polar - rings .",
    "the presence of ( likely ) companions near all three galaxies discussed here , and the apparent disturbed structure of the counter - rotating gas in at least two of them , suggest that the counter - rotating gas was indeed accreted in one or perhaps at most a few discrete events .",
    "other authors argue along similar lines for different objects ( e.g.@xcite for sa galaxies ) . based on the paucity of plausible nearby companions for their counter - rotators ,",
    "@xcite argue against tidally - induced mass transfer and favor ( single ) mergers , but they recognize that possible culprits may be hard to identify .",
    "in fact , the higher h@xmath86/h@xmath8i ratio observed in counter - rotating spirals ( compared to polar - rings and normal galaxies ) argues for the accretion of external material , as there should be increased atomic to molecular gas conversion near the co- to counter - rotating transition region @xcite .",
    "h@xmath8i synthesis observations may actually represent the best hope of identifying `` smoking gun '' evidence for external gas accretion , since both faint galaxies and tidal features are most easily detected in h@xmath8i .",
    "data for a significant number of ionized - gas counter - rotators may thus go a long way toward identifying the origin of the counter - rotating material ( or at least ruling out some possibilities ) .",
    "synthesis observations of the current sample of @xmath24 counter - rotators have already been acquired and will be discussed in future publications ( e.g.  @xcite for ngc  1596 ) .",
    "given that the counter - rotating gas in ngc  128 , ngc  1596 and ngc  3203 was discovered during a study of b / ps bulges , in which @xcite argued that the b / ps bulges of all three galaxies are in fact thick edge - on bars , it is worthwhile to ask if the counter - rotation itself might help us understand the structure , formation and evolution of those bulges .    as argued above",
    ", it is likely that the counter - rotating gas in all three galaxies was accreted from nearby objects during tidal interactions .",
    "it is thus entirely possible that the bars argued to be at the origin of the b / ps bulges were triggered by those same interactions .",
    "indeed , it has been firmly established through numerical simulations that bar formation can be triggered or accelerated by gravitational interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "standard bar - driven evolution ( e.g.  gas inflows , buckling , redistribution of angular momentum ) may then take over , most likely driving the galaxies toward earlier types and the bulges toward boxy and peanut shapes .",
    "@xcite in fact present a simulation where a galaxy satellite is acccreted , triggering the formation of a bar which subsequently evolves into a b / ps bulge .",
    "such a scenario is thus possibly at play in ngc  128 , ngc  1596 , and ngc  3203 .",
    "the same interactions might also trigger bar formation in the satellite galaxies , if they are not accreted or destroyed in the process .",
    "this may in fact be the case in ngc  1596 s companion ngc  1602 , which is also barred . independently of bar - driven evolution , it is of course also possible that minor mergers will lead to bulge growth and disc thickening , again driving the host towards earlier types .",
    "the counter - rotating gas discs may also provide an independant test as to whether ngc  128 , ngc  1596 , and ngc  3203 are truly barred .",
    "indeed , only rotating triaxial potentials possess stable counter - rotating periodic orbits which are inclined with respect to the equatorial plane ( e.g. , the so - called anomalous orbits ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the counter - rotating gas in the three galaxies is settled , as seems to be the case in ngc  128 and possibly in ngc  1596 , then it must lie in such a configuration ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "using integral - field spectroscopy , @xcite clearly showed that this is the case in ngc  128 , thus supporting the barred origin of its b / ps bulge , but ngc  1596 and ngc  3203 lack both integral - field spectroscopy and narrow - band imaging .",
    "although the above argument has not received much attention in the literature , integral - field and fabry - perot observations clearly show that the counter - rotating ionized - gas discs in the ( nearly ) edge - on s0 galaxies ngc  4546 @xcite and ngc  7332 @xcite are also inclined , although they are also rather disturbed . both are believed to be barred ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that @xcite and @xcite discuss the development , evolution and kinematic signatures of counter - rotating bars in the presence of counter - rotating stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "using our previous studies of the ionized - gas and stellar kinematics of a relatively large sample of @xmath0 edge - on disc galaxies with ( mostly ) boxy and peanut - shaped ( b / ps ) bulges , we have identified two new galaxies ( ngc  1596 and ngc  3203 ) where the ionized gas is counter - rotating with respect to the bulk of the stars .",
    "we have also confirmed similar kinematics in one additional object ( ngc  128 ) .",
    "counter - rotating gas is thus present in @xmath1 of our entire sample . however",
    ", if only lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies are considered , the fraction climbs to @xmath2 .",
    "this fraction further climbs to @xmath3 if only s0s with extended ionized - gas are considered . as discussed at length in the text ,",
    "those fractions are consistent with but slightly higher than the few existing systematic studies available in the literature . merging those studies , fractions of @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are obtained for , respectively , all s0s and s0s with ionized - gas only .",
    "based on the presence of probable companions near the galaxies discussed here , we argued that minor mergers and tidally - induced transfer of material from nearby objects are primarily responsible for the counter - rotating gas .",
    "if accretion on to the objects is isotropic , similar processes must have been at work in roughly twice the fractions of objects discussed .",
    "this strongly argues for a non - negligible role of ( minor ) accretion in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the presence of counter - rotating gas in barred galaxies offers a number of largely unexplored ways to probe the structure and dynamics of those objects . in edge - on galaxies in particular , where counter - rotation is easiest to detect",
    ", it offers an independent way of testing the barred nature of b / ps bulges .",
