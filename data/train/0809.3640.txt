    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) ensembles of interacting magnetic nanoparticles are currently the subject of an intense fundamental and technological research activity.@xcite the magnetic particles in these systems are subject to both local couplings and long - range interactions . by varying the interparticle distance the relative importance of these two contributions can be tuned to a certain extent .",
    "the magnetic response can then be correlated with the size distribution and the geometrical arrangement of the nanoparticles , the latter being experimentally accessible through a number of microscopy techniques .",
    "of particular interest is the slow magnetic dynamics,@xcite like magnetic ageing , rejuvenation , or magnetic viscosity.@xcite these non - equilibrium effects are reminiscent of the spin glass behavior observed in impurity spin systems with nonuniform exchange couplings.@xcite in fact , the magnetic nanostructures studied in this paper can be viewed as a super - spin glass with giant magnetic moments that interact via the dipole coupling .",
    "one of the experimental approaches to 2d nanostructures derives from investigations of three - dimensional ( 3d ) ferrofluids consisting of non - overlapping magnetic particles in a liquid or frozen solvent.@xcite the controlled preparation of 2d nanoparticle ensembles with different degrees of structural and magnetic disorder has recently become feasible by reducing the thickness of 3d ferrofluids to within a few particle diameters.@xcite a second experimental approach to 2d magnetic nanosystems stems from the study of thin magnetic films that are grown by depositing atoms on nonmagnetic substrates.@xcite in the early stages of film growth , before a continuous layer is formed , it is possible to obtain a controlled distribution of magnetic islands that interact by long - range forces like dipole coupling or ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions in case of metallic substrates.@xcite as a consequence of the preparation conditions , these magnetic nanostructures are usually characterized by the presence of a considerable degree of structural disorder .",
    "this manifests itself , for instance , in the particle - size dispersion or in the irregularity of the particle arrangement .",
    "the magnetic behavior of magnetic nanostructures is determined by the interplay between single - particle properties ( e.g. , magneto - crystalline or shape anisotropies ) and interparticle effects ( e.g. , dipolar , rkky or exchange interactions ) . for weakly coupled systems the local contributions dominate , and the interactions can be handled as perturbations . in this case",
    "the magnetic relaxation is governed by single - particle fluctuations that can be described by a superparamagnetic arrhenius - like model showing blocking effects at low temperatures.@xcite however , in the most interesting case of strongly interacting magnetic nanostructures , for example , for densely packed nanoparticles , the single - particle approach is no longer appropriate.@xcite here the system exhibits a complicated , spin - glass - like behavior , characterized by a complex energy landscape , a large number of metastable minima , and a non - collinear magnetization of the particle ensemble.@xcite for these strongly interacting systems the magnetization dynamics is determined by a collective response . in other words , changes in the magnetization direction of a given particle inevitably cause neighboring particles to vary their magnetic directions as well . during the transition from a local energy - minimum to another one , within a magnetic relaxation process , the magnetization directions of many particles change .",
    "therefore , the collective behavior of the nanostructure has to be taken into account from the start .",
    "the disorder within the nanostructure and the anisotropic long - ranged nature of the dipole interaction represent a serious challenge for theoretical investigations so that simple analytical approaches are in general not applicable .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations have been performed in order to achieve a detailed description of these systems.@xcite phenomenological , macroscopic quantities like the field - cooled and zero - field - cooled magnetization curves , the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities , or the magnetic relaxation rate have been calculated.@xcite moreover , the magnetic transitions between energy minima have been investigated by solving a continuum dynamical model including dissipation and thermal fluctuation terms ( langevin dynamics ) as well as by using path - integral methods.@xcite in order to take into account the diversity of nonequivalent trajectories , these calculations involve optimizations in a space of dimension @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of particles , @xmath2 the number of degrees of freedom , and @xmath3 the number discretizations of the relaxation path .    the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the collective microscopic processes occurring along the magnetic relaxations of disordered magnetic nanostructures .",
    "to this aim we focus on the elementary transitions along the minimum energy path ( mep ) connecting two neighboring local minima across a single saddle point .",
    "these fundamental processes can be regarded as the microscopic analogy to the barkhausen - jumps of the magnetization in hysteresis loops .",
    "the actual macroscopic relaxation is the result of a succession of such transitions between metastable states .",
    "understanding them is therefore very important for the modelization of the long - time dynamics .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to analyze the properties of these magnetic rearrangements from a local perspective by determining the variations @xmath4 in the directions of the magnetic moments at each nanoparticle @xmath5 . in particular a correlation range @xmath6",
    "is defined , that measures the spatial extent of the relevant collective processes as a function of experimentally important parameters like particle density and degree of disorder .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the energy barriers is quantified in order to determine how they correlate with the changes in the magnetic configurations .",

    "the purpose of this section is to describe the main aspects of the present model of disordered magnetic nanostructures .",
    "further details of the theory may be found in ref .  .",
    "we consider a 2d system of @xmath7 non - overlapping , spherical magnetic particles contained in a square unit cell with periodic boundary conditions . due to the strong interatomic ferromagnetic exchange interactions and the small size of the particles under consideration ,",
    "it is clear that each particle @xmath5 can be regarded as a single - domain or stoner - wohlfarth magnet carrying a giant spin @xmath8.@xcite the modulus of the local moments is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic magnetic moment and @xmath11 the number of atoms in particle @xmath5 .",
    "different kinds of structural arrangements are considered in the following : ( i ) a periodic square - lattice array , ( ii ) a disordered array where the particles are randomly dispersed around the sites of a periodic square lattice according to a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath12 , and ( iii ) a fully - random particle distribution of non - overlapping particles within the unit cell .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the effects of the dipole coupling on the collective magnetic behavior .",
    "this is a particularly interesting physical situation , since in the limit of weak magnetic anisotropy and external magnetic field the numbers of local minima and the complexity of the energy landscape are expected to be largest . for each particle arrangement the dipolar interaction between the particle moments @xmath8",

    "the infinite range of the dipole interaction is taken into account by computing an ewald - type summation over all periodically arranged unit cells of the extended planar system.@xcite since the particles do not have direct metal - metal contacts , no interparticle exchange interactions are included .",
    "taking into account these short - range contributions , as well as local magnetic anisotropies or external magnetic fields , poses no major technical difficulties and could be investigated by similar simulations . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all particles have the same size @xmath18 atoms , which corresponds to a particle radius of about 15 lattice constants .",
    "previous studies have actually shown that the dominant disorder effects are due to the irregularity of the particle arrangement and that the distribution of particle sizes yields a similar behavior.@xcite the directions of the particle magnetizations @xmath8 are restricted to the plane of the nanostructure .",
    "hence , the magnetic configurations are characterized for simplicity by the set of in - plane angles @xmath19 in the unit cell ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the particle ensemble is characterized by the number of particles @xmath7 in the unit cell , by the standard deviation @xmath12 of the structural disorder of the particle array , and by the surface coverage @xmath21.@xcite the size of the unit cell is defined in terms of @xmath7 and the average interparticle distance @xmath22 . for a given realization of the nanostructure",
    "we sample randomly the energy landscape and determine a large number of first - order saddle points ( sps ) or transition states .",
    "these are characterized by having one negative eigenvalue of the hessian of the interaction energy @xmath23 [ see eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ] . to locate the sps we use a variant of the eigenvector - following method that is based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hessian matrix as described in the appendix .",
    "the two neighboring energy minima adjacent to each sp and the associated mep are obtained by a simple steepest descent procedure starting at the sp along the negative - curvature direction . in this way the elementary relaxation path ,",
    "the energies @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the saddle point @xmath26 and adjacent minima @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as well as the corresponding sets of magnetization angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are determined . in this context",
    "it is interesting to mention that loop - like paths also exist , where the sp connects a local minimum with itself via a closed loop ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the presence of these features of the energy landscape is favored by the periodicity of the angular functions entering eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , loop - like meps have been excluded from the present analysis , since they do not contribute to the magnetic relaxation .",
    "the range @xmath6 of the magnetic correlations involved in an elementary transition is quantified in two steps as follows .",
    "first , the epicenter @xmath32 of the angular variations @xmath33 between the two adjacent minima is determined from @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the position of the center of particle @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath32 needs not to coincide with the position of any particle .",
    "second , the dependence of @xmath4 on the distance @xmath36 to the epicenter is fitted by an exponential of the form @xmath37 from which the correlation range @xmath6 is obtained .",
    "the angular variations are normalized with respect to the maximal change @xmath38 occurring in that particular pair of states .",
    "the factor 2 in the exponential is introduced in order that @xmath6 covers most of the significant angular variations .",
    "hence , for @xmath39 the change of angle @xmath4 is reduced by a factor @xmath40 with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "however , the use of an exponential fit should not be interpreted as a statement on the precise distance dependence of @xmath4 , which is presently not known in detail .    the euclidean distance between the saddle point @xmath26 and the adjacent minimum @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 \\}^{1/2 } \\ ; .\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath43 provides a quantitative measure of the changes in the magnetic order during an elementary transition .",
    "the correlation ranges @xmath6 and distances @xmath43 are averaged over a large number of elementary transitions ( typically a few thousands ) and several geometrical arrangements of the particles in the nanostructure . in the following calculations parameters appropriate for fe particles are used , i.e. , @xmath44 and nearest neighbor distance @xmath45   .",
    "the most stable magnetic arrangement of a periodic square lattice of dipole coupled magnetic nanoparticles having all the same size is know to correspond to the so - called microvortex state.@xcite this magnetic order has a vanishing net magnetization and is characterized by a continuous degeneracy with respect to the microvortex angle .",
    "any , however small , deviation from the square - lattice symmetry lifts this degeneracy . for weak disorder",
    "the low - energy states preserve a close resemblance with a microvortex state but as the disorder increases the apparent extended periodicity of the magnetic structure is completely lost . in the case of strong disorder the magnetic state",
    "is characterized by head - to - tail arrangements of the particle moments and by local flux closures of the magnetization profile . in this section results",

    "as already noted , the time evolution of the magnetization of the nanostructure can be described by a succession of the elementary transitions investigated in this work .",

    "they can be determined in the framework of transition - state theory including finite - temperature effects . besides the elementary transitions involving collective rotations of the particles moments within a limited correlation range , the magnetic relaxation of the nanostructure as a whole involves some complex domain - wall - like motion that results from a sequence of elementary processes . in the case of time - dependent fields , averages over trajectories",
    "should be performed in order to simulate hysteresis loops from a microscopic point of view .    for more realistic simulations and for a detailed comparison with experiment",
    "it would be interesting to take into account other potentially important contributions , for example , the magnetic anisotropy energy of individual particles and the interaction with external magnetic fields .",
    "qualitatively , one expects that increasing the single - particle anisotropies or the applied field should tend to reduce the correlation range of the elementary dynamical process , since the magnetic relaxation would be increasingly dominated by single - particle effects .",
    "another aspect deserving further study concerns the distribution of particle sizes , which is certainly unavoidable in real nanostructures .",
    "in fact previous works@xcite suggest that they should have similar , probably less severe consequences on the energy landscape as the positional disorder considered here .",
    "more interesting interaction effects on the dynamics are expected to result from other types of interparticle couplings , for instance , indirect rkky interactions between np on metallic substrates , or direct exchange interactions at the boundaries of bare nps in contact .",
    "these energy contributions can be treated straightforwardly using the methods developed in this work .",
    "the trend to increasing localization of the magnetic excitations with increasing disorder in the particle arrangement should be of interest for tailoring materials for information storage .",
    "in fact , a stronger disorder decreases the minimum distance required for an independent switching of neighboring ` bits ' .",
    "hence , controlling the main parameters characterizing the nanostructure allows to optimize their magnetic response as potential high - density magnetic - storage media or spintronic devices , for example , by tuning the particle arrangements and the coverages .",
    "this also reveals the limits for single - particle read and write processes in interacting magnetic nanostructures .",
    "research in these directions is currently in progress .",
    "the method to determine the first - order saddle points is based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hessian matrix of the energy @xmath23 as a function of the magnetization angles @xmath19 [ see eq .",

    "<S> the magnetic relaxation processes in disordered two - dimensional ensembles of dipole - coupled magnetic nanoparticles are theoretically investigated by performing numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the energy landscape of the system is explored by determining saddle points , adjacent local minima , energy barriers , and the associated minimum energy paths ( meps ) as functions of the structural disorder and particle density . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in the magnetic order of the nanostructure along the meps connecting adjacent minima are analyzed from a local perspective . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we determine the extension of the correlated region where the directions of the particle magnetic moments vary significantly . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that with increasing degree of disorder the magnetic correlation range decreases , i.e. , the elementary relaxation processes become more localized . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the energy barriers , and their relation to the changes in the magnetic configurations are quantified . </S>",
    "<S> finally , some implications for the long - time magnetic relaxation dynamics of nanostructures are discussed . </S>"
