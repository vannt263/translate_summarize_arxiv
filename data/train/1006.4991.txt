    "the quantum theory can not be explained by any underlying classical local hidden variable model , according to the bell theorem.@xcite it allows to verify that , contrary to the classical case , the results of quantum mechanics violate a special inequality @xcite under the conditions : ( i ) dichotomy of measurement outcomes or their restricted set in some generalizations , @xcite ( ii ) freedom of choice of the measured observables @xcite and ( iii ) the time of the choice and measurement of the observable shorter than the communication time between the observers . relaxing",
    "any of the above three conditions opens a ( i ) detection , ( ii ) free will or ( iii ) communication loophole , which permits to construct a local hidden variable model explaining the results of the experiments.@xcite the performed experimental tests confirmed the violation of bell inequality with all the loopholes closed @xcite but never all simultaneously .",
    "@xcite the remaining loophole is `` closed '' by a reasonable additional assumption .",
    "the bell test is also stronger than the entanglement criterion , viz .",
    "the nonseparability of states , @xcite which assumes a finite dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "loophole - free violation of bell inequality , not just entanglement , is also necessary for successful quantum cryptography,@xcite although the loopholes are probably less important than decoherence problems .",
    "@xcite    there is a growing interest in tests of nonclassicality in solid state systems , especially electrons in noninteracting mesoscopic junctions.@xcite unlike bosons , even noninteracting fermions in the fermi sea can get entangled due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "for example , entangled electron - hole pairs are created at both sides of a biased tunnel junction .",
    "so far the efforts concentrated on testing entanglement by second - order current correlations.@xcite unfortunately , to make the genuine bell test , the charge flow quantization must be measured directly , which has so far only been achieved in quantum dots.@xcite however , in tunnel junctions and quantum point contacts rather current cumulants @xcite are directly accessible and , so far , the noise @xcite and the third cumulant @xcite of the current have been measured .",
    "the quantization of charge flow is also not so evident at short timescales or high frequencies when vacuum fluctuations of the fermi sea play a role .",
    "@xcite in some cases , energy filters can restore the bell correlations at short times,@xcite at the expense of opening the detection loophole ( most of electrons get lost).@xcite    in this paper we present a genuine bell test for mesoscopic junctions , which does not require the usual assumption that only quantized charge transfers are detected . instead of quantized events , we shall treat the current as a continuous , time - dependent observable .",
    "as we will show - second order correlations in this case can be always explained classically .",
    "hence , we need a bell inequality for unbounded variables , without a sharp dichotomy , which will require to exploit correlation functions and higher moments / cumulants . such an inequality has been recently discovered @xcite but the violation requires at least 10 observers and 20th - order averages .",
    "moreover , the corresponding bell - like state is not feasible in mesoscopic junctions .",
    "our inequality will need only two observers and maximally fourth moments / cumulants .",
    "the inequality reduces to the usual bell inequality if the quantization is granted .",
    "a violation is possible in a mesoscopic tunnel junction with spin filtered leads or pierced by tunable magnetic flux .",
    "we first prove _ weak positivity _",
    "( classicality of second order quantum correlations ) , next conctruct the bell - type inequality based of fourth order moments , then implement it in the tunnel junction and finally discuss possible loopholes .",
    "let us begin with the simple proof that first- and second order correlations functions can be always reproduced classically . to see this , consider a real symmetric correlation matrix @xmath0 with @xmath1 for arbitrary , even noncommuting observables @xmath2 and the density matrix @xmath3 .",
    "this includes all possible first - order averages @xmath4 by setting one observable to identity or subtracting averages ( @xmath5 ) . since @xmath6 for @xmath7 with arbitrary real @xmath8 ,",
    "we find that the correlation matrix @xmath9 is positive definite and any correlation can be simulated by a classical gaussian distribution @xmath10 .",
    "note that the often used dichotomy @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath12 , which requires @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , every classical inequality @xmath14 contains the highest correlator of even order .",
    "hence , to detect nonclassical effects with unbounded observables , we have to consider the fourth moments .",
    "as usual we introduce two separate observers , alice and bob that are free to choose between two observables , ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , respectively . the measurements can give arbitrary outcomes ( not just @xmath19 ) .",
    "we have the following algebraic identities : @xmath20\\nonumber\\\\ & & + a'b[(a^2-b^2)+(b'^2-a'^2)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ab'[(a'^2-b'^2)+(b^2-a^2)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -a'b'[(a^2-b'^2)+(b^2-a'^2)]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath21\\nonumber\\\\ & & -aa'[(b'^2-a^2)+(b'^2-a'^2)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + bb'[(a^2-b^2)+(a^2-b'^2)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -bb'[(a'^2-b^2)+(a'^2-b'^2)].\\label{iden } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now apply the cauchy inequality @xmath22 to @xmath23 , @xmath24 , then @xmath25 for @xmath26 given by the right - hand side of ( [ iden2 ] ) and @xmath27",
    ". then we use again the cauchy inequality for @xmath28 . on the right - hand sides of",
    "( [ iden2 ] ) and ( [ iden ] ) we have 16 terms of the form @xmath29 . to decouple those containing simultaneous measurements of @xmath30 and @xmath31 we first use the triangle inequality @xmath32 for the sum of all terms and finally the cauchy - bunyakovsky - schwarz - type inequality @xmath33 to each term individually .",
    "we end up with our main inequality @xmath34 where @xmath35 when @xmath36 . for the complete derivation ,",
    "see the appendix .",
    "the inequality contains up to fourth - order averages which is a trade - off for relaxing the condition of dichotomy ( or trichotomy , considering also @xmath37 ) .",
    "it reduces to the standard bell inequality @xmath38 if we restrict the possible values of @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "if all observables are allowed to take the additional value @xmath37 only simultaneously then the inequality still reproduces bell multiplied by the probability of nonzero outcomes .",
    "all correlations in the inequality are measurable also in a bell - type test , because none of them contains @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "hence , we can say that the degrees of freedom measured by @xmath41 and @xmath42 are entangled if the inequality ( [ bell ] ) of their correlators is violated .",
    "we emphasize that this requires only the assumption of nonnegative probability distribution @xmath43 and provides an unambiguous proof for entanglement .",
    "returning to quantum mechanics , let us take the standard bell state @xcite @xmath44 , @xmath45 , with @xmath46  standard spin pauli matrices @xmath47 acting in hilbert space @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and averages @xmath52 .",

    "alice and bob can test the inequality ( [ bell ] ) by measuring the difference between charge fluxes in the upper and lower arm as shown in fig .",

    "the measured probability distribution can be treated as a convolution @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the gaussian detection noise ( independent of the system and later subtracted ) and @xmath99 is a quasiprobability,@xcite where @xmath100 for time ordered observables , @xmath101 .",
    "the detection noise adds @xmath102 to the measurement outcome @xmath103 with @xmath104 . in the interaction - free limit [ the sensitivity @xmath105 much smaller than the time resolution of the measurement , the timescale of @xmath95 ] one can calculate averages with respect to @xmath99 using existing methods based on full counting statistics and its extension .",
    "@xcite the averages needed in the inequality ( [ bell ] ) can be derived using four - lead full counting statistics generating functional@xcite in the tunneling limit ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 with fermi distributions @xmath109 . in our case , one obtains a simple physical picture : the electron - hole bell pairs are transmitted according to poissonian statistics .",
    "the averages ( cumulants and moments ) are found by taking derivatives of ( [ fcss ] ) with respect to @xmath110 . in particular",
    ", we have @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the inequality ( [ bell ] ) gets a simplified form in this particular case , @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "we stress that ( [ ineq ] ) follows from theoretical predictions and the experimental test still requires the measurement of all averages in ( [ bell ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath117 , where @xmath118 for @xmath119 with a smooth crossover at @xmath120 .",
    "having assumed the tunneling limit ( @xmath107 ) , we make the following approximations 1/ntt_0\\{|ev|,k_bt}/ht_0/1[scales ] with @xmath88 denoting the total number modes going through the barrier . in this limit , all moments and cumulants are equal a^()2n _ ( ) , n>0[avvg ] hence the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) is negligible and the inequality takes the usual form @xmath121 , which can be violated by appropriate choice of the spin axes . instead of time domain",
    ", one can measure correlations in frequency domain ( up to @xmath122 ) and make a fourier transform.@xcite if the scattering is mode - independent then one can assume that the junction consists of minimally @xmath123 independent channels , where @xmath124 is the total conductance of the junction , and repeat the whole above reasoning with @xmath125 replaced by @xmath126 ( experimentally  dividing measured cumulants @xmath127 by @xmath128 ) .",
    "the communication loophole is still open , not only because the system is nonrelativistic but also because the measurement time @xmath129 is larger than the flight time between detectors ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "let us impose shorter measurement @xmath131 .",
    "far from the barrier the vacuum fluctuations of incoming and reflected current do not cancel each other .",
    "for the noise measured at frequencies @xmath132 , the incoming and reflected current become independent and the noise saturates to the same value as for the completely open barrier , @xmath133 hence for @xmath134 , which ruins any attempt to violate ( [ bell ] ) , as the tunneling factor @xmath135 is lost .    finally , the detection loophole is closed only partially , because we get the violation of ( [ bell ] ) only for the quasiprobability @xmath99 , after subtraction of the detection noise @xmath136 , which adds up to @xmath137 , and appears in the cumulant generating function @xmath138 , preventing ( [ bell ] ) from violations .",
    "such subtraction is justified because the gaussian detection noise is independent of the system as an inherent feature of interaction - free measurement and can be experimentally measured at zero bias voltage.@xcite it affects only the second cumulant not higher cumulants , for example @xmath139 is the same for @xmath99 and @xmath140 with @xmath141 , which can be confirmed experimentally .",
    "we have proved that second - order quantum correlations can be always interpreted classically .",
    "we constructed a classical inequality for nonlocal correlation measurements involving up to fourth - order correlations .",
    "a violation of this inequality can serve as a cumulant - based bell test for entanglement .",
    "in particular , it can be applied to mesoscopic junctions relaxing the charge quantization assumption .",
    "a spin - resolved quantum measurement on tunnel junctions violates the inequality in an experimentally accessible range of temperatures , voltages and time / frequency resolution .",
    "the communication and detection loophole remain open due to long - distance vacuum fluctuations and detection noise .",
    "closing these loopholes will be a challenge for future research .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental violation of the inequality ( [ bell ] ) will be a very important step for the understanding and control of quantum entanglement in mesoscopic physics .",

    "we summarize some details on the derivation of our main inequality ( [ bell ] ) , following the instructions in the main article .",
    "let us first rewrite identity ( [ iden2 ] ) as      where we labeled the terms for later use .",

    "<S> the creation and detection of entanglement in solid state electronics is of fundamental importance for quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that second - order quantum correlations can be always interpreted classically and propose a general test of entanglement based on the violation of a classically derived inequality for continuous variables by fourth - order quantum correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme provides a way to prove the existence of entanglement in a mesoscopic transport setup by measuring higher order cumulants without requiring the additional assumption of a single charge detection . </S>"
