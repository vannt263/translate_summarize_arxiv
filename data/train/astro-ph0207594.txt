    "the x - ray source 4u  1700 + 24  ( also known as 2a 1704 + 241 ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) was first discovered in _",
    "scans for high - latitude x - ray sources @xcite , and by the @xmath10 ( sas a ) x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "it has a typical flux of ( 1@xmath11 ( 210  kev , equivalent to 0.55  mcrab as measured by a range of x - ray missions ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and experiences occasional outbursts . during a 100-d x - ray high state in 199798 , 4u  1700 + 24 was observed by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "this high state was the larger of two known outbursts of this system , and the x - ray flux reached a peak of 40  mcrab .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 4u  1700 + 24 is similar to that of other accreting neutron stars , and generally requires a blackbody with a temperature of 0.91.3  kev plus a hard component at higher energies for an acceptable fit .",
    "the x - ray spectral hardness and the lack of uv continuum imply that the compact object is almost certainly not a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "a black hole companion is also unlikely since the thermal x - ray component in black hole candidates is typically an order of magnitude lower in temperature than that measured in 4u  1700 + 24 .",
    "however , no rapid quasi - periodic or coherent x - ray variations have been confirmed @xcite , which is rather unusual for an accreting neutron star .",
    "position measurements , @xcite proposed the association of 4u  1700 + 24  with the 8th magnitude m2 iii star hd  154791 . in a recent re - analysis of _ rosat _ hri data ,",
    "however , @xcite found only a 10% chance that the two sources are associated , but did not propose an alternative candidate .",
    "previous optical spectroscopy ruled out radial velocity variations with amplitudes greater than @xmath12 on time scales of 40 min to @xmath13  yr @xcite , strongly suggesting that either the orbital period is significantly longer than one year , or that the system is viewed very close to face - on ( inclination angle @xmath14 ) .",
    "hd  154791  may be only the second symbiotic - like binary known to contain a neutron star , after the well - studied m - giant / x - ray pulsar system v2116  oph / gx  1 + 4 . however , these systems are quite different in x - rays ( table [ comptable ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the optical spectrum of v2116  oph exhibits extremely strong , variable emission lines , probably powered by uv photons originating from an accretion disk @xcite . in contrast , hd  154791  has much weaker line emission .",
    "in fact , optically the spectrum is very close to that of an isolated m giant ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we describe optical and x - ray observations which go some way towards resolving the uncertainties surrounding this system .",
    "we compare the properties of hd  154791/4u  1700 + 24  with those of v2116  oph / gx  1 + 4 , and discuss what may be inferred about the former in light of our results .",
    "echelle spectra of hd  154791  were obtained using intensified reticon detectors on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the whipple observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona , and also the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at oak ridge observatory , massachusetts .",
    "the observations were made between 1982 april 12 and 1996 october 26 , with the 18 observations before 1992 october 7 taken at mt .",
    "hopkins , and those since taken at oak ridge .",
    "the instruments are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the spectra cover a 44  bandpass centered around 5200   , with a resolution of approximately @xmath15 .",
    "each observation consisted of a 1020 minute integration of hd  154791 , with 90  s th - ar comparison scans before and after .",
    "the positions of around 30 strong spectral lines in each calibration scan were fit with a fifth - order polynomial , and the pre- and post - observation scans were then combined to calibrate the wavelength scale for each spectrum .",
    "typical residuals to the polynomial fit were 0.5  pixel , corresponding to 0.01   , or @xmath16 .",
    "approximately 25 lines were common to the entire set of wavelength solutions .",
    "the radial velocity was measured by cross - correlating each observed spectrum with an m - star template spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and measuring the mean offset .",
    "quadratic least - squares fits to the peak in the cross - correlation function give a radial velocity accurate to better than @xmath17 .",
    "the radial velocity measurements show significant variations of approximately @xmath17 about the mean systemic velocity of @xmath18 ( figure [ orbit ] ) .",
    "we searched the data for periodic signals in the range 501000  d by calculating the lomb - scargle periodogram ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and found a marginally significant peak near a period of 410  d ( lomb - normalized power 10.5 ; estimated significance from bootstrap simulations , @xmath19 ) . fitting an elliptical orbit to the data gave a solution with orbital period @xmath1  d and radial velocity amplitude @xmath2 ( table [ orbtbl ] ; solid lines in figure [ orbit ] ) .",
    "the reduced-@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) for the fit was 1.26 , indicating a marginally acceptable fit . while the best - fit eccentricity was 0.26 , the deviations from circularity were significant at less than the @xmath22 level .",
    "there was also evidence for variations in the radial velocity on longer time scales .",
    "we calculated @xmath21 for an eccentric orbit as a function of trial period for periods up to 4000  d. while the 404  d signal gave rise to a @xmath21 value close to 1 , lower values were achieved at substantially longer periods around 1930  d ( @xmath23 ) , 2370  d ( 1.02 ) and 3700  d ( 0.91 ) .",
    "the irregular spacing of the measurements did not allow us to distinguish clearly between these periodicities ; eccentric orbital solutions with any one of the three periods can account for the long - term radial velocity variations .",
    "the observations do not cover more than one full cycle for these longer - period signals , so more observations are needed to determine whether they are true periodic variations or aperiodic trends related to irregular red - giant variability .",
    "@xcite noted tentative evidence for an approximately @xmath24  d periodicity in _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) data . to investigate the 400-d periodicity , we obtained 1-d averaged asm measurements of 4u  1700 + 24  between 1996 january 5 and 2002 april 18  ( mjd 5008752382 ) from the asm www site at http://xte.mit.edu .",
    "the mean quiescent asm count rate was @xmath25 . during the flare observed between 1997 september  december ( mjd 5070050800 ) ,",
    "the 1-d averaged rate reached @xmath26 ( figure [ asm ] , top panel ) .    to avoid a biased period measurement due to the presence of the 199798 outburst",
    ", we initially calculated a lomb - normalized periodogram over the interval from the end of the outburst ( around 1998 march 28 ) to 2002 april 18 .",
    "the result was a peak with lomb - normalized power 14.05 ( equivalent to 3.9@xmath27 ) , at @xmath28  d. we estimated the period uncertainty by folding the asm data on the detected period , and calculating 1000 sets of statistically equivalent data sets with the same time sampling , average profile and noise properties per bin as measured in the original data set .",
    "the variance in the detection periods of the simulated data sets is then a measure of the uncertainty in the actual detection .    to obtain a more precise estimate of the quiescent x - ray periodicity , we excluded those measurements with errors of @xmath29 . around 13% of the 1-d",
    "averaged asm measurements had errors above this threshold , possibly due to source variability on time scales less than a day , but more likely arising from low - significance detections due to solar contamination or other sub - optimal observing conditions .",
    "these low - significance measurements appeared to introduce a bias to the period measurements , and also tended to contribute disproportionately to the estimated uncertainty in the period .",
    "a lomb - normalized periodogram calculated on this subset of data following the outburst resulted in a peak power of 24.04 ( estimated significance @xmath30 , equivalent to @xmath31 ) at @xmath32  d. to confirm the above results , we used the phase - dispersion minimization technique of @xcite and folded the asm light curve on a grid of periods between 200 to 1000 d. we found that the x - ray flux was most likely modulated with a period of @xmath33 d. combining the results from the latter two period - search techniques , we determine the period of the x - ray oscillation to be @xmath5  d with the epoch of maximum at mjd @xmath34  d. the mean profile of the post - outburst asm measurements folded on the 400  d period is also shown in figure [ asm ] ( inset , bottom panel ) .",
    "the profile was approximately sinusoidal with an amplitude of @xmath6  asm  @xmath7 , or 31% rms . with the periastron time from the orbital fit used as a reference phase for the fold , we find that on average the x - ray maximum occurs 0.1 in phase ( @xmath35  d ) after periastron .    for comparison , we also calculated an oversampled lomb - normalized periodogram of the entire asm data set ( including the 199798 outburst ) , which revealed a significant periodicity at 383  d ( identical to that measured following the outburst ) .",
    "the 199798 outburst was unusual ; no similar events were observed by the asm in @xmath36  yr of monitoring .",
    "thus , it may have occurred due to a mechanism distinct to some extent from the periodic behavior of the quiescent emission .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the behaviour of the persistent emission prior to the outburst was different than afterwards .",
    "although only a little more than one 400-d interval was covered before the outburst , the persistent flux was weakly anticorrelated compared to the mean profile measured following the outburst . applying the same error threshold ( @xmath37 ) to the full data",
    "set resulted in an increase in both the peak power and period , to 51.1 ( estimated significance @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) at 385  d. the shorter measured periods using the full asm data set may be attributed to aliasing resulting from a delay between the nearest phase of x - ray maximum for the persistent emission and the peak of the 199798 outburst . if 4u  1700 + 24  is similar to wind - accreting neutron stars in high - mass binaries , we may expect large outbursts to correspond only approximately with periastron phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the peak of the 1997 outburst falls around mjd 50780 , approximately @xmath40  d after the nearest epoch of maximum flux according to the 400-d periodicity detected in the post-1997 outburst asm measurements , and approximately @xmath41 days after periastron passage according to the orbital solution discussed in  [ sec : radvel ] ( figure [ asm ] ) .",
    "we have found evidence for significant variation in the radial velocity measurements from hd  154791 , which we fit with an eccentric orbit with period @xmath1  d. we have also found evidence for a significant variation in the x - ray flux from 4u  1700 + 24 .",
    "our best estimate of the x - ray period is @xmath5 d. hence , the periods measured from the radial velocity and asm x - ray flux variations are consistent .",
    "it is compelling to suggest that these two periodicities arise from a common source .",
    "naturally , it is also possible that the agreement between the two periodicities is merely coincidence , and that hd  154791  and 4u  1700 + 24  are unrelated . estimating the probability of such a coincidence depends upon the origin of the periodicities in each star , as well as the intrinsic distributions of these phenomena . in practice",
    ", it is not possible to make such an estimate with much confidence .",
    "however , it is clear that the likelihood of an unrelated red giant and x - ray source being at nearly the same measured position at high galactic latitude , and also both having a periodicity      that would be unusual for either type of source separately , is extremely small .",
    "the detection of a 400-d modulation from both stars therefore supports the original suggestion that hd 154791 is the optical counterpart of 4u  1700 + 24 .",
    "there are several plausible mechanisms for a correspondence between the radial velocity and the persistent x - ray flux .",
    "we consider two possibilities for the origin of the 404-d period in the hd  154791 radial velocity curve : orbital motion , and pulsational variation of the m - giant .",
    "precise optical photometric monitoring could distinguish between these two possibilities , since the maximum brightness occurring at any phase besides that of maximum recessional velocity would favour orbital motion .",
    "if the radial velocity variations are due to orbital motion , the 400-d x - ray flux modulation may arise from changes in the accretion rate onto the neutron star as it follows an elliptical orbit around the companion and moves through different nebular densities .",
    "such modulation is common in high - mass wind - accreting x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the times of periastron passage in our best - fit orbital model are very well correlated with the times of increased x - ray flux . for a 1.4  @xmath42 neutron star and red giant mass @xmath43 , the 404  d period and low amplitude of the radial velocity variations",
    "imply that the inclination is @xmath44 .",
    "although the _ a priori _ probability of observing such a system is @xmath45 , such a low inclination could explain the lack of x - ray pulsations or qpos from the source ( see  [ gxcomp ] ) .",
    "if the 400-d variation is in fact due to orbital motion , the longer - term variations in the radial velocities may be related to irregular variations in the red giant @xcite .",
    "alternatively , red - giant pulsations with @xmath46  d could modulate the stellar wind , and hence the accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
    "the iras fluxes of hd  154791 ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the flux density @xmath52 at 12 microns in jy ) indicate that is it not a mira variable @xcite .",
    "however , non - mira m - giants also pulsate .",
    "although typical fundamental pulsation periods lie in the range 20200  d , variations with a period up to an order of magnitude larger are also seen @xcite .",
    "if the 400-d variations are due to pulsation , one of the slower trends observed in the radial velocity variations could be related to orbital motion . in this case , the possible range of orbital inclinations becomes much more likely .",
    "an orbital period of 2370  d gives an inclination of 4@xmath53 while for a period of 3700  d the likely range is 5@xmath54 .",
    "also , the low accretion rate onto the neutron star would be more understandable if the orbital period is longer than 400 d. however , a longer orbital period alone can not account for the discrepancy in luminosity between 4u  1700 + 24 and gx  1 + 4 .",
    "finally , the shape of the 400-d radial velocity variation argues against a red - giant pulsation .",
    "pulsation light curves are typically non - sinusoidal ( in the sense that more time is spent with brightness below the median value than above it ) , and similar behavior would be expected for the radial velocity variations .",
    "if the 400  d periodicity in the hd  154791 radial velocities is due to orbital motion , then the orbital periods of hd  154791/4u  1700 + 24  and gx  1 + 4 may be quite similar ( see table [ comptable ] ) .",
    "this similarity makes the contrast between their other observed properties puzzling .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of gx  1 + 4 appears to be two to three orders of magnitude greater than that of 4u  1700 + 24 . in gx  1 + 4 ,",
    "there is clear evidence for an accretion disk @xcite , whereas in 4u  1700 + 24 there is no measurable uv continuum @xcite .",
    "gx  1 + 4 has a rich optical emission - line spectrum , and hd  154791 shows very little in the way of emission lines .",
    "finally , gx  1 + 4 is a 2-minute x - ray pulsar , whereas no coherent or quasi - period oscillations have been convincingly detected from 4u  1700 + 24 .",
    "one explanation for the differing x - ray luminosities is a larger mass - loss rate from the late - type giant in gx  1 + 4 .",
    "@xcite find that the m6 giant in gx  1 + 4 is probably near the tip of the first - ascent red - giant branch .",
    "hd  154791 has a spectral type m2 , and so would be expected to be losing mass at a lower rate .",
    "the relative lack of optical / uv emission lines suggests that either the ionized nebula in hd  154791/4u  1700 + 24  is substantially smaller and/or less dense than in gx  1 + 4 , or there are not enough uv photons to power nebular line emission in 4u  1700 + 24/hd  154791 .",
    "either of these conditions can plausibly arise if the mass loss from the companion is much smaller .",
    "moreover , if the binary separation is smaller in gx  1 + 4 than in 4u  1700 + 24/hd  154791  a larger fraction of the red giant wind could be accreted .",
    "the higher x - ray luminosity in gx  1 + 4 could also illuminate the red giant and increase the mass loss from the red giant further , in a sense producing a feedback effect .",
    "the observed variability of the optical spectrum of v2116  oph is evidence for the significant role played by x - ray heating . on the other hand , in 4u  1700 + 24/hd",
    "154791  the x - ray luminosity is perhaps low enough that very little illumination of the red giant or enhanced mass loss is expected . even during the 1997 x - ray outburst ,",
    "@xcite note that the optical spectrum was unchanged .",
    "finally , the lack of pulsations or qpos in 4u  1700 + 24  remains puzzling .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed a 900-s qpo , but this qpo was not confirmed in high - quality _ rxte _ data @xcite .",
    "high - precision optical photometry has also revealed a lack of pulsations ( down to a limit of 0.5% fractional variation ) , or rapid variations of any kind @xcite .",
    "this behavior is again in contrast to gx  1 + 4 , where @xcite find an oscillation in the optical emission with an amplitude of from 0.4 to 4.5% , plus stochastic variations . given that the optical light from gx  1 + 4 has a significant contribution from an accretion disk , the lack of rapid optical variations from hd  154791 provides evidence that any contribution from a disk in 4u  1700 + 24 is negligible in the optical regime as well as the uv regime .",
    "the lack of x - ray pulsations is expected if the 400-d radial velocity variations are due to orbital motion . as discussed in  [ sec : causeofcor ] , the low amplitude of the radial velocity variations requires @xmath55 , in which case any magnetic hot spots on the neutron star will be continuously in view ( assuming the ns spin axis is aligned with angular momentum axis of the binary ) . for higher and _ a priori _ more probable values of @xmath56 , the non - detection of pulsations may be explained if the accretion flow is not appreciably disrupted by the magnetic field of the neutron star above the surface ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and spreads the accreting material more or less evenly over the neutron star surface . given the extremely low luminosity ( and hence accretion rate ) of this source , standard calculations of ram and @xmath57-field pressure balance would require that the surface magnetic field strength of the neutron star be @xmath58  g , far below the canonical value for low - mass x - ray binaries or even old neutron stars in recycled ms pulsars .",
    "a more likely scenario consistent with larger @xmath56 is that the neutron star spin is very slow .    in conclusion ,",
    "all scenarios for 4u  1700 + 24/hd  154791 have some difficulties .",
    "we have presented some options , but more observational constraints are needed to select beween them .",
    "additional observations to determine whether the 400-d radial velocity variations are due to orbital motion or red - giant pulsation would also enable one to better interpret the differences between 4u  1700 + 24/hd  154791 and gx  1 + 4 .",
