    "few - body problems of interacting particles have vital importance in all branches of physics from hadron to celestial levels .",
    "the main interest in the few - body problems lies in , e.g. , finding an accurate solution for the system , testing the equation of motion and the conservation laws and symmetries , or looking for unknown interactions governing the system .",
    "the investigation of few - nucleon systems interacting via realistic forces has always been in the center of the interest .",
    "considerable effort has been exerted to obtain accurate ground - state properties of the few - nucleon systems with faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) @xcite , variational @xcite , variational monte carlo ( vmc ) @xcite and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches has focused on three- or four - body problems .    to treat an @xmath1-particle system",
    ", one needs to cope with a large number of variables required to specify the wave function . by using @xmath2",
    "relative coordinates to describe the system , for example , the discretization on a mesh with @xmath3 points , or the expansion of the function of the relative motion between the particles in terms of @xmath3 suitably chosen functions leads to @xmath4 mesh points or basis functions , which becomes prohibitively large with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "all but the monte carlo methods face this difficulty as the number of particles increases .",
    "the vmc and gfmc methods have proved to be most successful by being able to go beyond the four - nucleon problem @xcite .",
    "the secret of the efficiency of the monte carlo methods is the use of an importance sampling of the most relevant parts of the configuration space .",
    "this fact naturally raises a question : even if the wave function of the @xmath1-particle system is expanded into an ( excessively ) large number of basis functions , ca nt one reduce the problem to a tractable one by selecting `` the most important '' basis functions ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to present an alternative variational approach , the stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite , by using the correlated gaussians as basis functions @xcite .",
    "examples whose solutions were known before are used to demonstrate the performance of the method in treating nuclear as well as coulomb interactions . to highlight some new physics ,",
    "we have also included problems that have been hitherto unsolved .",
    "we give the formulation and some details of the method of the calculation and show applications to @xmath0-particle systems .",
    "the variational foundation for the time - independent schrdinger equation provides a solid and arbitrarily improvable framework for the solution of bound - state problems .",
    "the crucial point of the variational approach is the choice of the trial function .",
    "there are two widely applied strategies : ( 1 ) to select the most appropriate functional form to describe the short - range as well as long - range correlations and to compute the matrix elements by monte carlo technique , or ( 2 ) to use a number , possibly a great number , of simple terms , which facilitate the analytical calculation of the matrix elements .",
    "we follow the second course by using an expansion over a correlated gaussian  basis \" .",
    "to solve the @xmath1-particle problem , it is of prime importance to describe the correlation between the particles properly . the correlation is conveniently represented by a correlation factor , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "most calculations have used this form of @xmath6 directly to evaluate the matrix elements .",
    "such calculations are , however , fairly involved beyond the three - particle system and performed by monte carlo integrations .",
    "an alternative way to incorporate the correlation is to approximate @xmath7 as a linear combination of gaussians @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath1-particle basis function then contains product of these gaussians : @xmath9 .",
    "these gaussian functions are widely used in variational calculations ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we will apply a more general form of the correlated gaussian functions which allow for nonzero orbital angular momentum , and will use the more convenient jacobi relative coordinates instead of the relative distance vectors .",
    "the correlated gaussians have an important advantage .",
    "their hamiltonian matrix elements can be analytically calculated in a unified framework , thus enabling one to avoid the formidable calculation involving the correlation factor @xmath6 .    the variational approximation , however",
    ", may run into difficulties for the following reasons : ( i ) if the nonlinear parameters specifying the basis functions are varied , it is difficult to optimize them , ( ii ) if they are not , then the number of terms required may be excessively large , and , in both cases , ( iii ) the trial function of proper symmetry becomes extremely involved .",
    "for example , conventional methods @xcite for the choice of the gaussian parameters lead to prohibitively large bases for more than 3 or 4 particles , which has limited the applicability of the gaussian basis to few - body problems .",
    "one can circumvent the optimization problem including large number of nonlinear parameters or the diagonalization of huge matrices by using the svm .",
    "the svm attempts to set up the most appropriate basis functions by the following stepwise procedure : one generates a would - be basis function by choosing the nonlinear parameters randomly , judges its utility by the energy gained by including it in the basis , and either keeps or discards it .",
    "one repeats this `` trial and error '' procedure until the basis set up leads to convergence .",
    "the original procedure of the svm , proposed in @xcite , has recently been developed further and successfully applied to multicluster descriptions of light exotic nuclei , such as @xmath10he=@xmath11 , @xmath12he=@xmath13 , @xmath14li=@xmath15 , and @xmath14c=@xmath16he@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "learning from these applications , we have now generalized and refined the method further to encompass diverse systems emerging in nuclear and atomic physics .    besides the large number of nonlinear parameters ,",
    "the treatment of the increasing number of partial waves in the expansion of the wave function would also pose a formidable task .",
    "we propose here an alternative formulation to cope with this problem .",
    "instead of using the partial wave expansion , the angular dependence of the wave function is represented by a single solid spherical harmonics whose argument contains additional variational parameters .",
    "this form makes the calculation of the matrix elements for nonzero orbital angular momentum much simpler than other methods .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the present method has several unique features : it is based on a fully analytical calculation for most types of interactions and thus ensures high accuracy and speed .",
    "its calculational scheme is quite universal and needs no change depending on whether the system contains nuclear or coulombic or other interactions .",
    "it has no difficulty in treating the system of particles of unequal masses .",
    "more importantly , the wave function is obtained in a compact , analytical form and thereby can be readily used in calculations of physical properties .    as you will see later",
    ", the present method has turned out to be very accurate , and we think it is worth while to make the method and the results easily available and reproducible for interested readers .",
    "we collect all the needed ingredients of our method in order .",
    "some of the formulae are our original developments or generalizations of known relations to @xmath1-particle matrix elements , and some others are collected here to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements presented here is different from the one of refs .",
    "@xcite in many aspects : the motion of the centre - of - mass is removed from both the hamiltonian and the wave function .",
    "two - particle potential matrix elements of arbitrary radial form factor are evaluated in a unified way by reducing them to the calculation of appropriate correlation functions corresponding to the interaction .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements is extended to nonzero orbital angular momentum as well .",
    "the symmetrization postulate is imposed on the wave function at the single - particle level , which provides several advantages , especially in evaluating the matrix elements of state - dependent realistic nuclear interactions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii defines the correlated gaussian basis functions and gives the details of the stochastic procedure of selecting the basis set .",
    "section iii contains the method of calculating the matrix elements .",
    "the main steps are the calculation of matrix elements in slater determinants ( or permanents for bosons ) consisting of single - particle gaussian wave packets , the elimination of the center - of - mass motion with a very simple manipulation , and the transformation to the correlated gaussian basis .",
    "this section also presents the modifications needed for treating systems of particles of unequal masses .",
    "section iv presents numerical results for various systems of particles which interact via nuclear potentials or power - law potentials .",
    "section v gives a brief summary . in the appendices the most important auxiliary formulae are collected to facilitate any future use of the formulation .",
    "since the variational method is always limited by the form chosen as a trial function , the trial function must be flexible enough to be able to describe the full variety of correlations between the nucleons , e.g. , the short - range correlation due to the strong repulsive force , the @xmath18-clustering typical in some light nuclei , or the long - range correlation at large distances in light halo nuclei .",
    "the correlation between the nucleons can be described by functions of appropriate relative coordinates .    any square - integrable function with angular momentum @xmath19",
    "can be approximated , to any desired accuracy , by a linear combination of nodeless harmonic - oscillator functions ( gaussians ) of continuous size parameter @xmath20 : @xmath21 a generalization of this to @xmath1-nucleon systems contains a product of the gaussians as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "it is convenient to use a set of the jacobi coordinates @xmath22 , instead of @xmath23 relative distance vectors @xmath24 .",

    "it may be important , however , to include several sets of angular momenta @xmath40 for a realistic description .",
    "the various possible partial wave contributions increase the basis dimension ; moreover , the calculation of matrix elements for this choice of @xmath37 becomes too complicated .",
    "this choice is apparently inconvenient especially as the number of nucleons increases . to avoid this",
    ", we propose a different choice as the generalization of @xmath38 : @xmath41 only the total orbital angular momentum appears in this expression and it contains a parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the vector * u * may be considered as a variational parameter and one may try to minimize the energy functional with respect to it .",
    "it defines a linear combination of the jacobi coordinates , @xmath43 , and the wave function of the system is expanded in terms of its angle @xmath44 .",
    "the minimization amounts to finding the most suitable angle or a linear combination of angles .",
    "the factor of @xmath45 plays an important role in improving the short - range behavior of the wave function .",
    "a remarkable advantage of this form of @xmath37 is that the calculation of matrix elements becomes much simpler than in the former case because the coupling of @xmath46 angular momenta is completely avoided .",
    "the two forms of @xmath37 are in fact closely related to each other .",

    "therefore , if one can calculate the matrix elements using @xmath37 defined in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , then those with the previous form of @xmath37 can be obtained readily .",

    "although no restriction on the parameters of the matrix @xmath56 is in principle necessary , it is advisable to avoid too many variables if possible .",
    "the most naive choice would be to take @xmath56 as a unit matrix , which is equivalent to using only a single set of the jacobi coordinates , and then to try to reach convergence by including higher partial waves successively .",
    "many examples show @xcite , however , that this does not work well because the convergence is generally slow and moreover the computational cost of using high partial waves is quite expensive .",
    "the matrix @xmath56 can also be chosen as one of the rotation matrices that connect the set of the jacobi coordinates to other sets of independent relative coordinates .",
    "figures 1a-1f show all topologically different sets of independent relative coordinates for a system of six identical particles .",
    "the set of coordinates in fig .",
    "1a is what we call the set of the jacobi coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "a correlation conforming to a specific set of relative coordinates @xmath62 can be most efficiently described by tailoring the form of the basis function to this set of relative coordinates , that is , by using the form , exp@xmath63 . since the coordinates",
    "@xmath64 can be obtained by an appropriate rotation @xmath65 of the jacobi coordinates as @xmath66 , the basis function of such type can be clearly encompassed in the trial function of eq .",

    "this enables one to select the most appropriate parameters randomly .",
    "we set up the basis stepwise by choosing @xmath30 from a preset domain of the parameter space and increase the basis dimension one by one . in the first step we select a number of parameter sets @xmath30 randomly , and keep the one that gives the lowest energy .",
    "next we generate a new random set and calculate the energy with this two - element basis .",
    "as one more basis state always lowers the energy , we quantify its `` utility '' by the energy gained by including it in the basis . if the energy gain is larger than a preset value , @xmath76",
    ", then we admit this state to the basis , otherwise we discard it and try a new random candidate .",
    "this is repeated until the energy converges .",
    "the rate of convergence can be controlled by dynamically decreasing the value of @xmath76 during the search .",
    "this procedure is more advantageous than the earlier versions @xcite and , although not a full optimization , results in very good and relatively small bases . a similar procedure , called `` stochastic diagonalization '' has been used to determine the smallest eigenvalue of extremely large matrices @xcite .    to have an economical algorithm for setting up the basis by a trial and error method",
    ", one has to find an efficient way to solve the eigenvalue problem , eq .",
    "the full diagonalization is rather time consuming and in fact unnecessary because ( i ) in the @xmath77th step of the procedure we can use the result of the @xmath78th step and ( ii ) to judge the usefulness of a would - be basis state , only the lowest eigenvalue is needed .",

    "we remark the modifications needed to treat few - particle systems containing particles of unequal masses .",
    "as you will see , most of the formulation presented in subsections iii.a@xmath203iii.c remains unchanged .",
    "suppose that the masses of the @xmath1 particles are @xmath204 .",
    "the width parameter of the gaussian wave packet is to be changed to @xmath205 the overlap and hamiltonian matrix elements are obtained as a function of the generator coordinates , @xmath206 , in a form similar to the previous case . in this general case of unequal masses , the matrix @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( 28 ) which defines a set of the jacobi coordinates must be generalized to @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "the reduced masses corresponding to this @xmath134 are accordingly given , instead of eq .",
    "( 30 ) , by @xmath209 what is important is to realize that eq .",
    "( 31 ) , most crucial in eliminating the center - of - mass motion , still holds even with these modifications as @xmath210 it is then easy to see that the rest of all the formulae are exactly the same as the case of equal masses .",
    "we can conclude that the needed modifications noted above are rather trivial and simple but still assures the elimination of the center - of - mass motion .",
    "as a simple example of unequal masses , the system of @xmath211molecule will be considered in subsection iv.b .",
    "this section is devoted to present the solutions of various @xmath212-body problems by applying the method described above . to test the method , different potentials ( yukawa , gauss and coulomb )",
    "have been used for bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "some of the examples shown here has its own physical significance , and some other solutions may be considered as benchmark test and might be useful in comparison of various few - body methods .",
    "one can expect that , besides the vmc@xcite and gfmc@xcite , other methods will also be extended to treat more than @xmath213-particle systems . as only a few solutions are at present available for simple potentials , the examples listed here may help to test other methods .    as was discussed in subsection ii.a , there is no restriction on the choice of the orthogonal matrix @xmath56 .",
    "we have found , however , that those special rotation matrices which connect different sets of the relative coordinates especially suitable ( see also @xcite ) and will use them in what follows .",
    "this greatly helps to reduce the number of parameters of @xmath56 . in the stochastic selection of the basis elements ,",
    "these special matrices @xmath56 and the parameters of the diagonal matrix @xmath59 are randomly chosen .",
    "the vector @xmath214 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is also a variational parameter . to avoid an excessively large number of variational parameters we limited @xmath214-vector values to those which are needed to generate the function @xmath215 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) for a given set of angular momenta .",
    "comparison of our calculation with others confirms that these limitations have not deteriorated the accuracy of the present calculation , that is , our trial function is flexible enough . in the calculation the sets of angular momenta ( i.e. , the sets of these special @xmath214 vectors ) are also randomly chosen .",
    "the main advantage of using @xmath214 lies in the simple and systematic evaluation of the matrix elements from the point of view of both analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "further test calculations will be needed to explore the utility of @xmath214 as a variational parameter .    because the dependence of the matrix elements on the variational parameters is known as is shown in appendix d",
    ", one can organize the numerical calculation involved in the random search economically .",
    "a change of the values of the parameters does not require a recalculation of the whole matrix element .",
    "once they have been calculated for one set of values , to calculate them for many more requires virtually no time .",
    "the average computational time is 10 minutes for a four - body and 2 hours for a six - body calculation on the vpp500 computer of riken .",
    "we have performed model calculations adopting different central potentials as nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "some of these model problems have already been solved to high accuracy by various methods and therefore we can directly compare the solutions .",
    "the potentials used for comparison of different methods are ( i ) the malfliet - tjon ( mt - v ) potential @xcite , which has been most extensively used as benchmark test in few - body calculations , ( ii ) the volkov `` super - soft '' core potential @xcite , ( iii ) the afnan - tang s3 ( ats3 ) potential @xcite which exhibits a strong repulsive core and incorporates a difference between the spin - singlet and spin - triplet channels , ( iv ) and the minnesota potential @xcite which reproduces the most important low - energy nucleon - nucleon phase shifts .",
    "the volkov and mt - v potentials are spin - independent , while the ats3 and minnesota potentials are spin - dependent .",
    "the parameters of the interactions are tabulated in table i. we choose @xmath216 mev @xmath217 .",
    "the coulomb interaction is included only in calculations with the minnesota potential where point charges are assumed and @xmath218 mev fm .    the spins ( and isospins ) of the nucleons are coupled through successive intermediate couplings .",
    "the spin couplings up to @xmath219 nucleons are tabulated in table ii .",
    "one naturally expects and test calculations show that , without spin - isospin coupling , the energy convergence is much slower .",
    "the number of spin - isospin configurations rapidly increases with @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath10he , for example , assuming @xmath220 and @xmath221 , the wave function has @xmath222 spin - isospin components .",
    "the number of components becomes even higher if the interaction has non - central spin - orbit , tensor , etc .",
    "the nonlinear parameters are not optimized with respect to spin - isospin components , but rather , for each trial choice of the matrix @xmath30 , we select the spin - isospin component that gives the lowest energy . because the matrix elements between different spin - isospin components differ only in linear factors ( @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) ) , the calculation of the matrix elements of each spin - isospin component of the wave function requires essentially the same computational effort as that needed by the calculation for only one component .",
    "each calculation has been repeated several times starting from different random points to check the energy convergence .",
    "the energy as a function of the number of basis states is shown in fig . 2 for the case of @xmath10li with the volkov potential .",
    "the energies on different random paths , after a few initial steps , approach to each other and converge to the final solution .",
    "the energy difference between two random paths as well as the tangent of the curves give us some information on the accuracy of the method on a given size of the basis .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) radius of the few - nucleon system is calculated in each step and found to be rapidly convergent to its final value . by increasing the basis size",
    "the results can be arbitrarily improved when needed .",
    "the number of basis states required to reach energy convergence increases with the number of particles but it depends on the form of the interaction as well .",
    "this latter property is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 for the case of the @xmath18-particle .",
    "the soft - core volkov potential shows rapid convergence , while the hard - core ats3 interaction requires more basis states to get an accurate solution .",
    "the relatively fast convergence for the mt - v potential of a strong repulsion can be explained by the simplicity  the spin - independent nature  of this interaction .    in the following",
    "we show tables for the ground - state energies @xmath223 and point matter rms radii @xmath224 .",
    "the basis dimension @xmath78 of the svm listed in the tables is such that , beyond it , the energy and the radius do not change in the digits shown .",
    "table iii shows our results ( svm ) , together with results of others , for the application of the spin - averaged mt - v potential @xcite to @xmath1=27-nucleon systems . for three - body systems , the solution of the faddeev equation is known to be the method of choice , but the svm can easily yield the same accurate energy . as the mt - v potential is a preferred benchmark test of the few - body calculations ,",
    "there are numerous solutions available .",
    "table iii includes a few of the most accurate results .",
    "the nice agreement for four - nucleon case corroborates that the svm is as accurate as the direct solution of the fy equations @xcite , the method of the amalgamation of two - body correlations into multiple scattering ( atms ) @xcite process or the vmc @xcite and gfmc @xcite method . the basis used in the coupled - rearrangement - channel gaussian - basis ( crcg ) variational method @xcite is similar to that of the svm , but the gaussian parameters follow geometric progressions .",
    "the fact that the basis size needed in the svm is much smaller proves the efficiency of the selection procedure .",
    "the results of the vmc calculation for the five- and six - nucleon systems are also in good agreement with the results of svm .",
    "the mt - v potential has no exchange term ; therefore , unlike the nature , it renders the five - nucleon system bound , and the nucleus tends to collapse as the binding energy increases with the number of particles .",
    "the next example is the volkov potential which , due to its very soft core , is the most readily solvable case .",
    "this simple potential is widely used in model calculations for light nuclei .",
    "as one sees in table iv , the results of svm agree with those of other calculations , especially with the one using hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) functions .",
    "the number of basis states needed to reach convergence is remarkably smaller than in the case of the mt - v potential . without the majorana exchange term ( @xmath225 )",
    "this potential also leads to a collapsing system . by setting the majorana parameter to @xmath226=0.6 , a commonly used value to get the correct binding energy ,",
    "one may obtain more reasonable energies . the volkov potential with @xmath226=0.6 does not change the energies of @xmath1=2@xmath2034 nuclei , does not bind @xmath227li in accordance with the nature , but does bind the @xmath10li ground state ( @xmath223=@xmath20331.82 mev , @xmath228 = 2.69 fm ) .",
    "another potential that is often used in test calculation is the ats3 potential .",
    "we have challenged the svm to get solution for this case because , unlike the volkov , this spin - dependent potential has a relatively strong repulsive core ( see table i ) .",
    "the solution , although on a somewhat larger basis , can easily be obtained , and it is in good agreement with those of other methods in the @xmath1=3 system as shown in table v. we note , however , that the energy of the svm is significantly lower than the ones of other methods for the @xmath18-particle .",
    "this may be due to the strong repulsion of this potential .",
    "for example , the fy calculation @xcite agrees with ours for the mt - v potential , but shows a noticeable difference in the case of the ats3 potential .",
    "the variational calculation @xcite using a correlation factor also misses considerable energy for the ats3 potential .",
    "surprisingly , inspite of its exchange part , this potential also binds the five - nucleon system and overbinds the six - nucleon systems very much .",
    "the last example for the few - nucleon system uses the more realistic minnesota potential@xcite , which is a central interaction of gaussian form , containing space- , spin- , and isospin - exchange operators ( see table i ) .",
    "the minnesota potential has often been used in cluster - model calculations of light nuclei .",
    "table vi shows results with this potential , where the coulomb interaction between protons is also included .",
    "all possible spin and isospin configurations are allowed for and all spherical harmonics that give non - negligible contribution are included in @xmath37 . since the method has proved to be accurate and reliable for other potentials , it is justifiable to view these results as testing the interaction rather than the method , and hence the results are compared with experimental data .",
    "the energy and the radius of triton and @xmath18-particle converge , with small bases , to realistic values .",
    "the minnesota potential , correctly , does not bind the @xmath1=5 system , but it binds @xmath10he and slightly overbinds @xmath10li .",
    "the radius of @xmath10he is found to be much larger than that of @xmath229he , consistently with the halo structure of @xmath10he @xcite .",
    "it is for the first time that the minnesota force is tested without assuming any cluster structure or restricting the model space by any other bias .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good not only with experiment but also with cluster - model calculations for all nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that none of these simple potentials binds the four - neutron system .",
    "the volkov potential , for example , is so strong that it binds the singlet two - neutron system , but it does not allow the neutrons to form a four - neutron bound state due to the pauli principle .    as an example for bosonic nuclear few - body system , we consider the case of structureless @xmath18-particles interacting via the state - independent potential ; @xmath230 - 130\\,\\,{\\rm exp}\\,[-(0.475r)^2\\ , ] \\ \\ \\ \\ ( { \\rm mev}),\\ ] ] where @xmath231 is in fm .",
    "this potential is taken from ali - bodmer s @xmath232-state potential@xcite .",
    "it has a repulsive core which is about 370 mev high and extends up to 2 fm .",
    "the repulsive core prevents the @xmath18-particles from collapsing .",
    "the results are compared in table vii .",
    "our calculation agrees with the atms result for the @xmath2333 and 4 systems .",
    "the results for the long range @xmath234 potential are collected in this subsection .",
    "the first example is the polyelectric system @xmath235 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath92 positrons and @xmath187 electrons form a bound system was originally suggested by wheeler @xcite and this question has been extensively studied since then . besides the trivial and analytically solvable @xmath236 and @xmath237 case , the existence of the positronium negative ion ( @xmath238 ) was also predicted by wheeler @xcite .",
    "dozens of works have attempted to solve the @xmath239 coulombic three - body problem , continuously refining the accuracy of the calculated binding energy @xcite . despite of numerous attempts , no one has obtained bound states for the polyelectric system of more than four particles . the positronium negative ion has experimentally been observed @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the positronium molecule @xmath240 was first calculated by hylleraas and ore @xcite . to date",
    ", the positronium molecule has not been directly observed , and this fact intensifies the theoretical interest to solve this coulombic four - body problem .",
    "this molecule is short - lived because the electron and positron may annihilate . unlike the positronium ion , the positronium molecule is neutral , and therefore the best chance to distinguish it from the positronium itself is related to their different lifetimes .",
    "the qed formulae to determine the probability of a pair annihilation in the positronium molecule through a @xmath241-photon process ( @xmath242,1,2 , ... ) would require a highly accurate wave function @xcite .    in table viii",
    "we compare our results to the most precise calculations found in the literature .",
    "the correlated gaussian function without the polynomial part ( @xmath243 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) is known to poorly represent the coulomb cusps @xcite . to improve the cusp properties",
    "the trial function with @xmath244 polynomials has been used .    as is shown in table viii ,",
    "our calculation reproduces the first six digits of the variational calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite for the ground state of ( 2e@xmath245,e@xmath246 ) , and the rms radius also agrees with it .",
    "there are two recent variational calculations @xcite for the positronium molecule using the correlated gaussian functions . in these",
    "works the nonlinear parameters were determined by optimatization . to compare our calculations to theirs directly ,",
    "the value of @xmath243 was chosen and the same basis size ( @xmath78=300 ) was used .",
    "our result is slightly better than the energy obtained by them and this reinforces the reliability and powerfulness of the random selection of the nonlinear parameters .",
    "the number of nonlinear parameters of this case is @xmath247 .",
    "the complete optimatization of the parameters is , of course , superior to the svm .",
    "test calculations show that , provided the number of parameters is low , that is , a full optimatization is feasible , the optimatization finds lower energy .",
    "but when the number of parameters becomes high , the full optimatization becomes less and less practical partly because it fails to find true minimum and partly because the computation becomes too excessive .",
    "we found no bound states for the ( @xmath248 ) and ( @xmath249 ) systems .",
    "the energy of ( @xmath249 ) , for example , converges to the sum of the energy of a dipositronium molecule and of a positronium ( 0.515989 a.u.+0.25 a.u.=0.765989 a.u . ) . allowing the selection of the parameters from a larger region increases the rms radius , which is typical of an unbound state .",
    "the system of a negative and a positive positronium ion thus forms no bound state but dissociates into a dipositronium molecule and a positronium .",
    "calculations for @xmath250 state also fails to find a bound system .",
    "this result entails that the coulomb force can not bind more than four particles out of identical charged fermions and their antiparticles .    to examine the role of the pauli principle in preventing five - electron - positron system from forming bound states , we repeated the same calculation replacing the fermions by bosonic equivalents . on a different scale",
    ", these systems may be identified , e.g. , as the systems of @xmath251 and @xmath252 with their strong interaction neglected @xcite .",
    "such bosons turn out to form bound states even for @xmath253 .",
    "as is expected , the radius of the charged boson system decreases as the number of particles increases .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energies of bosonic and fermionic systems are equal for @xmath254 and for @xmath213 .",
    "the reason is that the energy minimum belongs to the same spatial configurations , that is , to a triangular pyramid for @xmath213 , for example @xcite .    in table",
    "ix we show results for bosonic and fermionic systems with a purely attractive @xmath255 (  gravitational \" ) interaction . an @xmath1-body system of identical particles bound together by attractive pair potentials always collapses in large-@xmath1 limit ( the binding energy per particle rises with @xmath1 to infinity ) , even if the particles are fermions .",
    "self - gravitating boson systems have recently attracted some interest @xcite . for these systems , both variational lower and upper bounds are available . in this case",
    "even the five - fermion system is bound .",
    "thus the lack of bound states in five - electron - positron systems is a joint effect of the antisymmetry and of the repulsion between identical particles .    finally , we mention an example involving an excited state . with @xmath256 ,",

    "for the ground state but no information for the excited state .",
    "we have formulated a variational calculation for few - body systems using the stochastic variational method on the correlated gaussian basis . we have demonstrated the versatility of the correlated gaussians and the efficiency of the stochastic variation by various numerical examples for @xmath0-particle systems .",
    "all the details of both formulation and calculational procedure are included to make this paper self - contained and easily reproducible .",
    "the comparison with other calculations has corroborated the accuracy and efficiency of the method . in none of the test cases",
    "has the present method proved to be inferior to any of the alternative methods , and yet the method does not require excessive computational effort .",
    "the correlation between the particles plays an important role in describing the few - body system realistically .",
    "it has been taken into account in the framework of the correlated gaussian functions .",
    "the correlated gaussians are constructed from products of the gaussian wave - packet single - particle functions through an integral transformation , which has enabled us to evaluate the center - of - mass motion free matrix elements analytically starting from the single - particle level .",
    "the nonlinear parameters of the correlated gaussians have been selected by the stochastic variational method with a trial and error procedure .",
    "the success of the method using the correlated gaussian basis is probably due to the fact that none of the gaussians is indispensable , that is , there are different sets of the gaussian parameters that represent the wave function equally well .",
    "the method presented in this paper can be useful to solve few - body problems in diverse fields of physics such as description of microclusters , non - relativistic quark model , and halo nuclei . among others ,",
    "the most important application is the solution of the nuclear few - body problem , that is , a description of light nuclei by using @xmath259 nucleon - nucleon potentials . in this case one",
    "has to take into account both short - range repulsion and higher orbital angular momenta required by the non - central components .",
    "our test examples show that the correlated gaussian basis function might be a suitable candidate to cope with these requirements .",
    "as is explained in appendix b , the evaluation of the matrix elements for the non - central potentials poses no serious problem , and calculations including such potentials for nuclear few - body systems are under way .",
    "the limitations of the present method are those implied by the basis size and by the computer memory to store the matrix elements in the generator coordinate space .",
    "the limitations may become excessive as the number of particles and/or spin and isospin configurations become large .    to extend the method to nuclei of larger mass number in an approximate way , one can freeze part of the model space for a group of nucleons ( cluster ) .",
    "one can omit , for example , some of the spin or isospin channels .",
    "it might be a good approximation to consider only those spin channels where the spins of the like nucleon pairs are coupled to zero .",
    "one can also restrict the intrinsic spatial motion of a cluster by fixing the nonlinear parameters to some appropriate values .",
    "one can introduce @xmath1 clusters and place the nucleons of each cluster into a common harmonic oscillator well , for example .",
    "the microscopic multicluster model is based on this approximation .",
    "the matrix elements needed in this multicluster model are given as a special case of those presented in this paper .",
    "in fact , one only needs to choose the single - particle generator coordinates , @xmath260 , such that @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the number of nucleons in the @xmath263th cluster ( @xmath264 ) , and needs to couple appropriately the spins and isospins of the nucleons in each cluster to the spin and isospin of the cluster .",
    "the microscopic multicluster model has been successfully applied for description of the structure of light nuclei ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we summarize some merits of our method in the following :    \\(i ) fully analytical calculational scheme ; this plays a major role in the high speed and accuracy of the calculation .",
    "\\(ii ) universality of the scheme .",
    "one needs to introduce no change , for example , between describing a multinucleon system and a coulombic few - body system .",
    "it is easily adaptable to identical or non - identical particles , to fermions or bosons or mixed systems .",
    "the masses of particles may be different , yet no problem with the center - of - mass motion arises .",
    "\\(iii ) no expansion of the interaction is needed , and thus no problems in partial - wave truncation arise .",
    "\\(iv ) the convergence of the energy is fast .",
    "if one needs just a 23-digit estimate of the energy , it is enough to use a very small basis .",
    "\\(v ) the method is also accurate for excited states , which are obtained simultaneously with the same diagonalization ( provided their angular momenta and parities are the same as those of the ground state ; but only such excited states may be problematic ) .",
    "\\(vi ) the wave function is obtained in a compact , analytical form .",
    "it is then easy to use it in calculations of physical properties .",
