    "nuclear isospin and spin - isospin excitations play a crucial role in weak processes .",
    "a precise description of these transitions is necessary to progress on open issues in high energy physics and in astrophysics .",
    "searches for processes beyond the standard model , such as neutrinoless double beta - decay , require a detailed knowledge of the isospin and spin - isospin nuclear response .",
    "in particular , beta - decay @xcite , muon capture kortelainen:2002bz , kortelainen:2004gr the @xmath0 double - beta decay @xcite as well as charge - exchange studies @xcite are essential to constrain neutrinoless double - beta decay predictions ; while neutrino - nucleus has been pointed out recently as a new constraint @xcite .",
    "beta decay is one of the key ingredients of the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the role of neutrino - nucleus interactions is emphasized in @xcite for neutrino - nucleosynthesis and for the r - process @xcite .",
    "such processes are also an essential ingredient to determine the response of neutrino detectors which can serve as core - collapse supernova observatories .    the isobaric analogue states ( ias ) as well as the gamow - teller ( gt ) giant resonances represent the most studied cases .",
    "information on the associated nuclear transitions is essentially obtained through beta - decay or charge - exchange reactions . a satisfactory description of these excitations",
    "is now achieved using microscopic approaches : the shell model or the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) and its variants .",
    "the effective interactions associated with these models have been extensively discussed and some of their parameters have been determined using the allowed transitions as a constraint ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". however , one is still not able to explain why the measured gt transition amplitudes are always larger than the calculated ones .",
    "this is usually corrected by using an effective axial - vector coupling constant ( the `` quenching problem '' @xcite ) .",
    "little is still known for the states of higher multipolarity , such as the spin - dipole or the higher multipoles .",
    "their importance has been underlined in astrophysics ( see e.g. @xcite ) and is well established for neutrinoless double - beta decay ( see e.g. multipole , civitarese:2005jf ) . using sum - rules",
    ", one can relate the spin - dipole strength distribution to the neutron skin thickness defined as the difference between the root mean square radii of the proton and neutron distributions .",
    "this is an useful information to establish the nuclear matter equation of state of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "some information on these states has been extracted thanks to various weak and hadronic probes .",
    "a systematic study of muon capture is performed in @xcite and it is shown that no quenching of the forbidden states is required to account for the total capture rates . on the other hand , experiments with ( p , n ) and ( @xmath1he , t ) have been realized @xcite .",
    "calculations based on rpa overestimate the experimental results in the gamow - teller region , while they underestimate them in the 30 - 60 mev energy range @xcite . therefore if quenching of the forbidden states is necessary is an open issue .",
    "this question could be settled if more experimental information was available .",
    "furthermore the latter could be exploited to improve the parametrization of the phenomenological interactions used in microscopic approaches .",
    "neutrino - nucleus interactions can probe different spin - isospin and isospin states , depending on the neutrino energy .",
    "while neutrinos in the tens of mev , such as those produced by the sun , essentially explore the ias and gt excited states , those having several tens to hundreds mev , e.g. from core - collapse supernovea or from accelerators , also probe the spin - dipole and higher multipoles .",
    "these measurements are in most cases inclusive .",
    "however , different pieces of information can be obtained by using either sources where the energy of the neutrinos can be tuned or complementary probes .",
    "so far experiments are scarce , and include : a measurement on deuteron using reactor neutrinos @xcite , one on iron @xcite and several on carbon with conventional sources ( muon decay - at - rest or decay - in - flight ) @xcite .",
    "therefore for the numerous applications , one relies on the theoretical predictions available in the literature and based on different approaches .",
    "the calculations generally agree for neutrinos in the ten of mev where the response is dominated by the ias and the gt transitions . however , significant discrepancies appear at higher energies ( see e.g. @xcite for carbon and @xcite for lead ) .",
    "the origin of these disagreements is not yet clear and can be due to a different choice in the nuclear structure description ( e.g. the continuum treatment , the choice of the effective forces , or the correlations included ) .",
    "systematic neutrino - nucleus interaction measurements could be an ideal tool to explore the weak nuclear response . at present ,",
    "new experiments on various nuclei are being proposed with a new facility using muon decay - at - rest avignone:2003ep .",
    "another possibility could be offered by beta - beams .",
    "this is a new method to produce pure and well known electron neutrino beams , exploiting the beta - decay of boosted radioactive ions @xcite .",
    "the idea of establishing a low energy beta - beam facility has been first proposed in @xcite .",
    "its potential has been discussed in volpe:2003fi , serreau:2004kx , mclaughlin:2004va for nuclear structure studies , in @xcite for core - collapse supernova physics , and in @xcite for the study of fundamental interactions .",
    "( for a review on the low , medium and high energy scenarios as well as their physics potential see @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis of how neutrino spectral shapes change at low - energy beta - beams depending on the detector geometry and different locations within the same detector is made in @xcite , while the possibility of exploiting low - energy neutrinos at off - axis from a standard beta - beam is proposed in @xcite .    in this paper , we consider low energy beta - beams as a tool to study the isospin and spin - isospin nuclear response .",
    "this feature has been first underlined in @xcite and explored for the neutrino - lead reaction in @xcite .",
    "here we perform microscopic calculations of charged - current neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "the nuclear amplitudes are obtained using the mean field approach including pairing correlations and the random - phase - approximation among quasi - particles .",
    "we present the total neutrino - nucleus cross sections as well as the contribution of the various multipoles and discuss how their importance evolve , as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "we give the flux - averaged cross sections associated to low energy beta - beams and to conventional sources ( muon decay - at - rest ) , and compare the latter to previous calculations , when available .",
    "results are given for oxygen , iron , molybdenum and lead taken as sample nuclei .",
    "these nuclei present particular interest for neutrino detectors and supernova observatories , currently used or under study .",
    "in particular , oxygen is used in water cherenkov detectors , like super - kamiokande , the next - generation uno @xcite , memphys @xcite and hyper - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "an iron - based detector was considered in @xcite ; while molybdenum- @xcite and lead @xcite ones are being studied .",
    "note that the contribution of the different multipoles to the neutral current neutrino - lead cross section was studied theoretically in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical aspects are described in section ii .",
    "results on the isospin and spin - isospin states contributing to the cross sections as well as on the total and the flux - averaged cross sections are presented in section iii .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the total cross section for the charged current neutrino - nucleus scattering process @xmath2 is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the energy of the final ( initial ) nuclear state , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the incident neutrino energy ( momentum ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the outgoing lepton energy ( momentum ) .",
    "the effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath10 is derived by carrying out the foldy - wouthuysen ( fw ) transformation for the nucleon weak current operator and retaining terms up to @xmath11 ) ( m is the nucleon mass and @xmath12 is the momentum transfer ) . after performing a multipole expansion of the weak current ,",
    "the differential cross section for the transition between nuclear states with angular momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 is given by : @xmath15where @xmath16 is the weak coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the longitudinal and traverse response of the system to the external field . according to  @xcite",
    "these can be expressed as follows :    @xmath19 \\left\\vert \\left\\langle j_{f}\\left\\vert \\widehat{\\cal{l}}_{j}\\right\\vert j_{i}\\right\\rangle \\right\\vert ^{2 } \\\\",

    "the corresponding matrix elements defined for single - particle transitions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a correction to  ( [ e:2 ] ) must be introduced to account for the distortion of the outgoing lepton wave function due to the coulomb field of the daughter nucleus .",
    "while the fermi function @xmath27 accounts well for it at low neutrino energies , the modified `` effective momentum approximation '' ( ema ) offers a good procedure at high neutrino energies  @xcite .",
    "here we follow the prescription already used in previous calculations , where the fermi function is taken until the corresponding corrections give a larger cross section than those obtained with the ema approximation .",
    "flux - averaged cross sections are the measured observables .",
    "these are obtained by folding the energy dependent cross section  ( [ e:2 ] ) with the neutrino flux @xmath28 that depends on the specific neutrino source and the target geometry    @xmath29    the transition matrix elements entering in eqs .",
    "( [ e:3]-[e:7 ] ) are calculated within microscopic approaches .",
    "the starting point is a hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation for the ground - state of the nucleus , performed in coordinate space by using the skyrme - type effective interactions .",
    "the hf procedure determines the mean - field and single - particle ( s.p . ) occupied levels .",
    "the unoccupied levels are obtained by diagonalizing the hf mean - field using a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "therefore , the continuum part of the s.p .",
    "spectrum is discretized and discrete particle - hole ( ph ) configurations coupled to a given @xmath30 are used as a basis , in order to cast the rpa equations in the matrix form .",
    "this rpa calculation is self - consistent since the residual interaction among ph states is derived from the same skyrme force as the one used to produce the mean field .",
    "when necessary , to go beyond the closed - shell approximation for the ground state , pairing correlations are taken into account in the hf+bcs approximation .",
    "constant pairing gaps @xmath31 and @xmath32 for protons and neutrons are introduced . on top of the hf+bcs calculation",
    ", the qrpa matrix equations can be written with a procedure which parallels what was described above , with the two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) configurations replacing the ph ones .",
    "we do not present here the details of the qrpa formalism , which can be found in the literature .",
    "we simply note that the particle - particle matrix elements are here renormalized by means of a parameter @xmath33 that has been chosen to be smaller than 1 ( typically 0.7 ) to avoid the well - known ground - state instabilities .    for each multipolarity , every eigenstate of the rpa or qrpa equations is characterized by its @xmath34 and @xmath35 amplitudes and the transition matrix element for a generic operator @xmath36 is written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 label a given ph or 2qp states , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the bcs occupation amplitudes ( which reduce to 1 and 0 in the hf - rpa case ) and @xmath42 are single - particle matrix elements .",

    "we have checked that the use of the sgii force does not change the results significantly ( figure [ fig : totoxygen ] ) .",

    "we consider fully efficient cylindrical detectors as in  @xcite , namely @xmath55 m ( radius ) and @xmath56 m ( depth ) for metals and @xmath57 m , @xmath58 m water cherenkov detectors for oxygen .",
    "the neutrino flux corresponding to conventional neutrino sources , i.e. muon decay - at - rest ( dar ) is given by the well known michel spectrum .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : lownu ] , the latter has quite similar shape to a low energy beta - beam with @xmath59 . note that in principle since the cross sections approximately grow as the neutrino energy square , the flux - averaged cross sections can show differences due to the high energy part of the neutrino flux , as discussed in detail for the case of core - collapse supernova neutrino spectra @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : fluxavernu ] presents the contribution ( in percentage ) of the different states to the flux - averaged cross sections eq.([e:1]-[e:7 ] ) .",

    "the neutrino - oxygen cross section is dominated by the @xmath60 . only with increasing @xmath61 , the relative contribution of the @xmath62 decreases in favor of the positive parity multipoles .",
    "this behaviour is due to the oxygen structure : positive parity transitions require at least 2@xmath63 excitations .",
    "the situation is different for the neutrino - iron , neutrino - molybdenum and neutrino - lead cross sections . for these nuclei",
    "the @xmath64 case is dominated by the @xmath65 transitions , with a relative ratio of about 1/3 . when the ion boost increases , their contribution diminishes basically in favor of @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath66 the @xmath67 and @xmath68 contribution become as important as the isobaric analogue state .",
    "table  [ table : fluxaveranu ] presents the results for the anti - neutrino scattering where the anti - neutrino fluxes are produced by the decay of boosted @xmath69he ions . while the @xmath70 dominates the flux - averaged cross section at @xmath64 for the iron nucleus , about 50@xmath71 of its value",
    "is given by the @xmath60 transitions at ion boost 14 .",
    "on the contrary , these states dominate at low gamma for the lead nucleus , while almost all multipoles contribute at high gamma .",
    "this behaviour can be well understood in terms of the underlying shell structure of the lead nucleus , since the lowest pn - excitations between the filled and unfilled shells are of negative parity .",

    "we have presented new results on charged - current neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "the theoretical approach used is the random - phase - approximation among quasi - particles .",
    "four nuclei of particular interest have been chosen as typical examples , namely oxygen , iron , molybdenum , and lead .",
    "we have given both the total cross sections as a function of neutrino energy and the flux - averaged cross sections associated to possible future facilities producing low energy neutrino beams .",
