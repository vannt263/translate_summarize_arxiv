    "two areas at the forefront of research in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) over the last few years have been optical lattices and the hyperfine degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "optical lattices allow one to explore , in both the mean - field and quantum regimes , the effects of periodic potentials on bosons .",
    "these studies complement the vast body of knowledge concerning the behavior of fermions in periodic potentials coming from solid state physics .",
    "optical lattices are free of defects and disorder and the atomic potential has a simple closed form . in contrast , an electron in a solid is subject to a complex , imperfectly known potential that is usually marred by defects .",
    "the hyperfine states of the atoms making up a bec allow one to construct exotic spin structures based on the occupation of different hyperfine spin states of the form @xmath0 .",
    "becs of this kind , which are called spinor or _ multicomponent _ , have a vector order parameter .",
    "research on multicomponent becs has been instrumental in reaching important milestones in bec research , including the creation of a quantum vortex and the subsequent demonstration that a bec made from a weakly interacting alkali gas is superfluid  @xcite .",
    "recently , experimentalists have placed multicomponent becs in optical lattices  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we construct exact solutions to the mean - field equations of motion for multicomponent becs in one , two and three dimensional optical lattices .",
    "band theory was invented as a tool to analyze stationary solutions of the linear schrdinger equation with a periodic potential , a problem that does not have a solution in closed analytic form for realistic potentials .",
    "in contrast , for the _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equation ( nls ) with a sinusoidal optical potential , exact , closed - form stationary solutions have been discovered  @xcite .",
    "here we generalize and extend previous work to an overarching and rigorous treatment of certain classes of exact solutions describing the dynamics of condensates with @xmath1 components in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "our formalism permits us to construct exact , _ nonstationary _ solutions of the vector nls .",
    "this article brings together our new work and past treatments into a single , general , rigorous analytical framework . at the same time",
    ", we elucidate the most experimentally relevant and aesthetically pleasing solutions . we also perform a full nonlinear stability analysis where computationally tractable .",
    "a number of surprising stability regimes present themselves , as we will demonstrate .",
    "the basic idea that leads to our exact solutions is to use the nonlinearity to cancel the spatial variation of the potential , leading to an effective free particle problem .",
    "( clearly , this is not possible for the linear schrdinger equation . )",
    "this idea is due to bronski , carr , deconinck , and kutz , who originally applied it to a one - component , or scalar , bec in a one - dimensional periodic potential  @xcite .",
    "deconinck , frigyik and kutz extended this work on one - component becs to higher dimensions  @xcite , and to multicomponent condensates in one dimension  @xcite , but not to multicomponent becs in two and three dimensions .",
    "although the higher - dimensional jacobi elliptic periodic potentials considered by deconinck  _ et al .",
    "_ do not include the square , rectangular and simple cubic optical potentials readily available in the lab , hai and coworkers have shown that the cancellation technique can be used to construct solutions for a scalar condensate on a square optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "our extension of the cancellation technique to condensates with an arbitrary number of components @xmath1 in a sinuoidal optical potential of arbitrary dimension @xmath2 leads to an enormous number of new solutions , many of great experimental import .",
    "a crucial and challenging step in the cancellation technique is to find a solution ansatz that , for a given potential , allows the cancellation to occur . at the same time",
    ", the solution ansatz must satisfy the free particle schrdinger equation .",
    "a key aspect of our work is the introduction of a novel , very general solution ansatz that allows the solution of a wide range of problems .",
    "mean - field theory , which for a single - component condensate takes the form of the scalar nls or gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite , has been quite successful in describing experiments on multicomponent becs in optical lattices  @xcite . however , there are important approximations underlying its use",
    ". first , the tunneling or hopping energy @xmath3 must be much larger than the on - site interaction energy @xmath4 so that the system is far from the mott insulating regime  @xcite .",
    "this means that the potential barriers are not so high that the sites lose mutual phase coherence , and that a full many body quantum fock state treatment is not needed  @xcite .",
    "second , three - body and other loss processes are neglected .",
    "third , quantum fluctuations are ignored , as is always the case when the nls is applied to becs  @xcite .",
    "fourth , any possible resonances induced by the lattice or dimensional confinement are neglected  @xcite .",
    "fifth , when treating @xmath5 and @xmath6 , mean - field theory requires that the confining potential that reduces the effective dimensionality have a length scale smaller than or of the order of the healing length but larger than the scattering length  @xcite , i.e. , the underlying scattering process must remain three dimensional .",
    "three important conditions must be met if our cancellation technique is to apply .",
    "first , we can not include the low frequency harmonic trap often , but not always , present in experiments .",
    "such a trap is used to keep atoms from spilling off the edge of a finite lattice .",
    "we require the potential to be sinusoidal , although we _ do _ allow the lattice constant to be different in each direction , leading to , e.g. , a rectangular lattice in two dimensions .",
    "second , for condensates with three or more components , the mean - field theory normally includes coherent couplings between different components of the vector order parameter ; for two components , such couplings are prevented by angular momentum selection rules  @xcite . we require incoherent couplings only , which is appropriate for @xmath7 . for @xmath8",
    "our treatment is always correct for sufficiently short time scales  @xcite .",
    "our treatment can also be correct at arbitrary times when the hyperfine components are chosen from separate manifolds @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we can not treat a mixture of scalar bec s of different masses , despite the fact that such a system can be described by a vector mean - field theory with incoherent couplings only .",
    "although certain conditions must be satisfied for it to be applicable , our cancellation technique yields a panoply of exact solutions of great physical significance .",
    "for example , for a two - component condensate on a rectangular optical lattice , we find temporally periodic solutions in which the optical lattice is divided into two sublattices , and the condensate components oscillate back and forth between these sublattices . for the square optical lattice",
    ", we find a vortex - anti - vortex array for a scalar condensate , while for two - component condensates we obtain exotic solutions in which the optical lattice is divided into a total of four sublattices , and the condensate components move cyclically between these sublattices . as the dimension @xmath2 and the number of components @xmath1 are increased , the number of solutions our technique generates grows rapidly .",
    "the number of solution types is so vast in three dimensions ( 3d ) that , for the sake of brevity , we limit our discussion to stationary solutions with a high degree of symmetry and to two examples of non - stationary solutions .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : principal ] , we introduce the mean - field equations of motion and the optical potentials we will study . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rigorous ] , a complete and rigorous treatment of exact dynamical solutions for arbitrary dimensions @xmath2 and number of components @xmath1 is presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cases ] , we treat select cases in detail , giving examples of how to apply the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : rigorous ] ; of particular interest are the vortex - anti - vortex array we find in 2d and the array of intersecting vortex lines we find in 3d . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] , we present detailed stability studies of important solution classes , including the vortex - anti - vortex array , and an explicit connection to experimental units . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "consider an @xmath1-component bec in @xmath2 dimensions with incoherent couplings between components .",
    "the condensate is subject to an optical potential formed by @xmath2 linearly polarized retroflected light waves .",
    "let @xmath10 be the wave vector of the @xmath11 light wave , where @xmath12 will be called the directional index .",
    "we will restrict our attention to optical lattices with @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",

    "note that the atomic polarizability @xmath34 generally depends on the component , or hyperfine state , @xmath25 .    to illustrate how one arrives at the potential given by eq .",

    ", one can arrange for both of the spatial phases @xmath44 to vanish .",
    "the temporally averaged intensity is then @xmath45 the @xmath17 component of the bec is subject to the external optical potential @xmath46 .",
    "the optical potentials @xmath23 take the form  ( [ eqn : potential ] ) with @xmath6 if and only if the term in @xmath47 coming from the interference of the two light waves vanishes .",
    "if @xmath48 and @xmath49 differ , the interference term is zero and the optical potential has rectangular symmetry .",
    "if @xmath50 , on the other hand , the interference term vanishes if either @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "the optical lattice is then simply a square lattice . finally , if @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the structure of the optical lattice is more complex  @xcite .",
    "the interference terms in the intensity can also be made to vanish for @xmath55 : for example , we can choose the vectors @xmath56 to be orthogonal to one another . if @xmath57 , the optical lattice has simple cubic symmetry .    for simplicity , in this paper we will confine ourselves to optical potentials in which the interference terms vanish .",
    "the potential is then given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : potential ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting , though , that our solution techniques can be generalized to optical potentials with nonzero interference terms .",
    "the time evolution of the order parameter is described by the mean - field equations of motion  ( [ eqn : gp ] ) with the optical potentials  ( [ eqn : potential2 ] ) .",
    "we will seek solutions to this problem in which each of the effective potentials @xmath58 is constant .",

    "studies of specific cases with small @xmath1 and @xmath2 , especially in one spatial dimension , have appeared in the literature .",
    "our work brings these previous studies together , generalizes to arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and provides intriguing new solution types and novel physical interpretations .",
    "currently , there is a great deal of interest in the a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase in bose - einstein condensates at intermediate temperatures in 2d  @xcite . in such a phase ,",
    "vortex - anti - vortex pairs become bound together , in contrast to the free vortex proliferation which occurs at high temperatures . however , this phase is restricted to a truly 2d system , which is difficult to achieve experimentally .",
    "we have shown that an optical lattice stabilizes vortex - anti - vortex pairs in the quasi - two - dimensional case , and that the lattice causes the array to be tightly packed .",
    "not only have we presented multicomponent generalizations of 2d vortex - anti - vortex arrays , but we have also generalized them to three dimensions . in 3d , we constructed a solution in which one condensate component forms a lovely and complex three - dimensional array of intersecting vortex lines .",
    "as a part of our study of pc solutions in 3d , we gave a thorough treatment of the most highly symmetric solutions for condensates with two , three and four components .",
    "our formalism can also be used to gain insight into complex systems now experimentally available , such as five - component condensates in 3d optical lattices .",
    "we studied the stability of pc solutions numerically in 1d and 2d for one- , two and three - component condensates .",
    "we found three main results : ( 1 ) potential - canceling solutions tend to become stable as the potential strength is reduced ; ( 2 ) there is a remarkable difference between the one - dimensional and two - dimensional solutions , in that the latter are also stable for deep potentials ; and ( 3 ) for two - components in a square optical lattice , there is a fascinating third region of stability for intermediate - strength potentials .",
    "we found no evidence of stabilization at high potential strength in one dimension .    finally , we mention that the possibility of experimentally realizing vortex - anti - vortex arrays in a 2d lattice is provided for in the recent experiments of sebby - strabley _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in those experiments , two polarizations of the lasers used to create the optical lattice potential are manipulated to create lattices that can be dynamically controlled on a site - by - site basis . in this way",
    ", one can imagine creating an array of small `` propellers '' to stir up vortex - anti - vortex pairs .",
    "the parameter ranges in which such a procedure would lead to stable structures were determined in our numerical studies . to manipulate multicomponent condensates",
    ", one can imagine more advanced versions of such an experiment , in which the fact that different hyperfine components `` feel '' different lattice strengths for a given optical wavelength @xmath382 can be used to one s advantage .",

    ", we may assume without loss of generality that the @xmath115 s all have unit modulus .",

    "it follows that @xmath631 for all @xmath25 and @xmath69 .    by choosing a phase",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : alphas ] ) must be reconciled with the condition @xmath640 , i.e. , @xmath641 this is not possible for @xmath169 , and so there is no solution with both four - fold rotational and component symmetries in that case .    the case @xmath7 requires further analysis .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : sumalphas ] ) gives @xmath642 , where @xmath643 .",
    "similarly , the condition @xmath644 implies that @xmath645 , where @xmath646 . if @xmath647 , the condition @xmath648 becomes @xmath649 .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : densities ] ) shows that if @xmath272 is to have four - fold rotational symmetry , it is required that @xmath654 , which is an impossibility .",
    "we conclude that there is no solution with both four - fold rotational and component symmetries for two components .",
    "note that @xmath3 is normally called @xmath96 in the condensed matter literature and is sometimes denoted @xmath655 in the case of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "the @xmath655 notation leads to a `` @xmath656 '' model instead of a @xmath657 model , and so we avoid it .",
    "we will reserve @xmath96 for time as is standard in dynamics , and use @xmath3 for the hopping energy .",
    "for very weak potentials , with @xmath577 below about @xmath658 , corresponding to particle densities less than about @xmath659 per well , instability - onset times on the boundary of the inaccessible region exceeded the threshold defining the boundary of the stable region .",
