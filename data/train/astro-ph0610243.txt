    "from the rosat all - sky survey ( @xmath4 150000 sources ) and the tycho catalogs ( @xmath4 1000000 stars ) guillout et al .",
    "( 1999 ) selected about 14000 optical counterparts of stellar x - ray sources , the so - called rastyc sample .",
    "the high x - ray emission level of these sources is compatible with young stars in the solar neighborhoods , or with close binaries of the rs  cvn and by  dra classes , for which the high magnetic activity level is due to the synchronization of rotational and orbital periods .",
    "the knowledge of the incidence of binaries in this sample is of paramount importance for studying the recent local star formation history .",
    "we thus have started a spectroscopic observation campaign aimed at a deep characterization of a representative sub - sample of the rastyc population . as a matter of fact , the high - resolution spectroscopic observations allow to derive spectral types and luminosity classes , to infer ages ( by means of lithium abundance ) and to single out spectroscopic binaries .",
    "in addition , chromospheric activity levels ( from h@xmath2 emission ) and rotational velocities ( from doppler broadening ) , can be also determined .    in this work",
    "we report on the discovery of three single - lined ( sb1 ) and three double - lined ( sb2 ) late - type binaries , which have been observed with the 193-cm telescope of the _ observatoire de haute provence _ ( ohp ) and the 91-cm telescope of the catania astrophysical observatory ( oac ) . for these binaries",
    "we have obtained good radial velocity curves and orbital solutions . an accurate spectral classification has been also performed and the projected rotational velocity @xmath5 has been measured for all stars . the h@xmath2 emission and the lii@xmath6 line",
    "have been used to infer the chromospheric activity level and the lithium content , respectively .",
    "spectroscopic observations have been obtained at the _ observatoire de haute provence _ ( ohp ) and at the _ m.g .",
    "fracastoro _ station ( serra la nave , mt .",
    "etna , 1750 m a.s.l . ) of the catania astrophysical observatory ( oac ) .",
    "at ohp we observed in 2000 and 2001 with the elodie echelle spectrograph connected to the 193-cm telescope .",
    "the 67 orders recorded by the ccd detector cover the 3906 - 6818     wavelength range with a resolving power of about 42000 ( baranne et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the elodie spectra were automatically reduced on - line during the observations and the cross - correlation with a reference mask was produced as well .",
    "the observations carried out at catania observatory have been performed in 2001 and 2002 with the reosc echelle spectrograph at the 91-cm telescope .",
    "the spectrograph is fed by the telescope through an optical fiber ( uv - nir , @xmath7 core diameter ) and is placed in a stable position in the room below the dome level .",
    "spectra were recorded on a ccd camera equipped with a thinned back - illuminated site ccd of 1024@xmath81024 pixels ( size 24@xmath824 @xmath9 m ) .",
    "the echelle crossed configuration yields a resolution of about 14000 , as deduced from the fwhm of the lines of the th - ar calibration lamp .",
    "the observations have been made in the red region .",
    "the detector allows us to record five orders in each frame , spanning from about 5860 to 6700   .",
    "the oac data reduction was performed by using the echelle task of iraf package following the standard steps : background subtraction , division by a flat field spectrum given by a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a th - ar lamp , and normalization to the continuum through a polynomial fit .",
    "the photometric observations have been carried out in 2001 and 2002 in the standard @xmath10 system with the 91-cm telescope of oac and a photon - counting refrigerated photometer equipped with an emi 9789qa photomultiplier , cooled to @xmath11c .",
    "the dark noise of the detector , operated at this temperature , is about @xmath12 photon / sec .    for each field of the rastyc sources , we have chosen two or three stars with known @xmath13 magnitudes to be used as local standards for the determination of the photometric instrumental `` zero points '' .",
    "additionally , several standard stars , selected from the list of landolt ( 1992 ) , were also observed during the run in order to determine the transformation coefficients to the johnson standard system .    a typical observation consisted of several integration cycles ( from 1 to 3 , depending on the star brightness ) of 10 , 5 , 5 seconds , in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 filter , respectively .",
    "a 21-arcsecond diaphragm was used .",
    "the data were reduced by means of the photometric data reduction package phot designed for photoelectric photometry of catania observatory ( lo presti & marilli 1993 ) .",

    ", we used a sub - sample of the entire tgmet list , composed of 87 stars well distributed in effective temperature and gravity and in a suitable range of metallicities .",

    "the rotfit code was also applied to the oac spectra , using standard star spectra acquired at oac with the same instrumental setup .",
    "this was especially advantageous for df  cam , for which we have no elodie spectrum .",
    "we have performed an accurate spectral classification also for the components of sb2 systems , thanks to another idl code made by us , compo2 , which searches for the best combination of standard - star spectra able to reproduce the observed spectrum of the sb2 system .",

    "the detection of the chromospheric emission contribution filling in the line core is hampered by the complexity of the observed spectra of double - lined binaries in which the spectral lines of both components , shifted at different wavelengths according to the orbital phase , are simultaneously seen .",
    "therefore a comparison with an  inactive \" template , composed of two stellar spectra mimicking the two system components in absence of activity , is needed to emphasize the h@xmath2 chromospheric emission .",

    "the filling in of the h@xmath2 line of both components of hd  183957 is lower than that found for hd  166 ( @xcite ) , a k0v star belonging to the local association ( 100 - 300 myrs ) with a rotation period of 6.2 days .",

    "the elodie spectra of rastyc 221428 in the h@xmath2 region show that the cooler k0  iii - iv component displays a h@xmath2 line always in emission with a stronger intensity around phase 0.7 ( fig .",

    "the oac spectra of df  cam always display a pure h@xmath2 emission line , whose intensity varies with the orbital / rotational phase ( fig .",

    "similarly to rastyc 072133 , df  cam , considered as a semi - regular variable after hipparcos photometry , is very likely an active binary of the rs  cvn class .",
    "the equivalent width of the lithium @xmath36708 line , @xmath23 , was measured on the elodie spectra . for the three sources for which we were able to detect and measure @xmath23 ( table  2 ) , we have deduced a lithium abundance , @xmath24 , in the range 1.31.8 , according to @xcite nlte calculations .",
    "such values of lithium abundance indicate ages of at least a few hundreds myrs , so that the x - ray emission and the fairly strong h@xmath2 chromospheric activity detected in these systems should be essentially the effect of the rather fast stellar rotation due to the spin / orbit synchronization .",
