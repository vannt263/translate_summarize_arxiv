    "during the past decade , we have learned ( at last ) how to make rigorous contact between experimental low energy hadronic physics and qcd which is presumed to underlie such processes .",
    "this contact is provided by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , which exploits the ( broken ) chiral invariance of the light quark component of the qcd lagrangian and provides a representation for interaction amplitudes as an expansion in energy - momentum divided by the chiral scale parameter @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "a review of chpt techniques will not be attempted here , but has been presented in a number of sources , wherein it is shown that , at least in the goldstone boson sector , such a chiral approach provides a remarkably successful and predictive representation of a wide variety of experimental processes @xcite .",
    "the chiral technology begins by writing down an effective chiral lagrangian , the simplest ( two - derivative ) form of which is , in the goldstone sector , @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a nonlinear function of the pseudoscalar fields , @xmath5 is the quark mass matrix , @xmath6 is a phenomenological constant , @xmath7 is the covariant derivative , and @xmath8 is the pion decay constant in the limit of chiral symmetry .",
    "although these are only two of an infinite number of terms , already at this level there exists predictive power ",
    "e.g . , tree level evaluation of @xmath9 yields the familiar weinberg predictions ( at @xmath10 ) for s - wave @xmath11 scattering lengths @xcite which are approximately borne out experimentally .",
    "loop diagrams required by unitarity produce terms of @xmath12 and contain divergences .",
    "however , just as in qed such infinities can be absorbed into renormalizing phenomenological chiral couplings , and the most general `` four - derivative '' lagrangian has been given by gasser and leutwyler @xcite @xmath13 here the bare @xmath14 coefficients are themselves unphysical and are related to empirical quantities @xmath15 measured at scale @xmath16 via @xmath17 where @xmath18 are constants defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath19 is the usual parameter arising in dimensional regularization , with @xmath20 being the number of dimensions .",
    "gasser and leutwyler have obtained empirical values for the phenomenological constants @xmath21 .",
    "a wide range of electroweak and strong interactions of these goldstone bosons have been successfully treated within this formalism , but there is at least one recurring problem  whenever the s - wave i=0 @xmath11 interaction is involved the simple one loop predictions have in general been found to be wanting @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as the associated phase shift @xmath22 passes through @xmath23 somewhere in the vicinity of @xmath24 mev , which has sometimes been associated with the existence of a broad resonance in this region .",
    "such resonant behavior can certainly not be treated in any perturbative fashion and thus in this channel the chiral expansion must break down well before this energy is reached .",
    "there are a number of ways which have been used in order to avoid this difficulty .",
    "one is simply to confine predictions to a low enough energy that one - loop corrections should be sufficient .",
    "however , it is also possible to treat such effects nonperturbatively either by inclusion of s - wave i=0 ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) pole effects or by use of dispersion relations which effectively treat the @xmath11 interaction to all loop orders  but at the price of introduction of model dependence @xcite . this cost is usually considered worth paying , however , as by inclusion of such well - motivated model - dependence one can often reliably extend the usual region of validity of chiral predictions ( @xmath27 mev ) up to much higher values ( @xmath28 gev ) .",
    "a particularly useful example of this procedure has recently been provided for the process @xmath29 . because only neutral particles are involved there exists no tree level two - derivative or four - derivative contribution to this reaction , which guarantees that the one loop chiral perturbative prediction must itself be finite .",
    "this has been calculated as @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 ^ 2=1+{y\\over x}\\ln^2\\left({\\beta(s)+1\\over \\beta(s)-1}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ \\qquad{\\rm with}\\quad\\beta ( x)=\\sqrt{x-4y\\over x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the associated @xmath32 cross section is given by @xmath33 and is found to bear little resemblance to its recently measured experimental analog , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the solution to this problem has recently been explored by a number of authors and has been found to be related to the inadequacy of the one - loop approach in the i=0 s - wave @xmath11 channel @xcite .",
    "the solution is most clearly presented in terms of a dispersion relation approach .",
    "we assume , consistent with the chiral expansion , that when we are in the near - threshold region the only relevant higher order effects are in the helicity conserving s - wave amplitude , which we write as @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}:\\qquad f^{n}(s)&=&\\frac{2}{3}\\left[f_{0}(s ) - f_{2}(s)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i = 0 , 2 refers to the isospin of the final @xmath35 state . for neutral pion production and working in the gauge",
    "wherein @xmath36 the transition amplitude is @xmath37    in the charged pion case the born and seagull contributions to this multipole must also be included , so that the full amplitude becomes @xmath38.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the born approximation value for the helicity conserving s - wave multipole .",
    "in the threshold region the phase of @xmath41 is required by unitarity to be equal to the corresponding @xmath35 phase shift @xmath42 . when @xmath43 , inelastic reactions involving four pions are allowed .",
    "however , the inelasticity is small , being of order @xmath44 in the chiral expansion and will be neglected .",
    "the functions @xmath41 are analytic functions of s except for cuts along the positive and negative real axis . for positive @xmath45",
    ", the right hand cut extends from @xmath46 and is due to the @xmath45 channel @xmath35 state . for negative @xmath45",
    ", the left hand cut is due to @xmath47-channel intermediate states such as @xmath48 or @xmath49 , and extends from @xmath50 .",
    "the single - channel final state unitarization problem has a simple solution in terms of the omns function @xcite @xmath51 the result must have the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an analytic function with no cuts along the positive real axis .",
    "morgan and pennington consider a function @xmath54 which has the same left hand singularity structure as @xmath41 , but which is real for @xmath55 .",
    "they then write a twice subtracted dispersion relation for the difference @xmath56 , with the result @xcite @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 are subtraction constants .",
    "picking @xmath59 to be given by its born value and matching onto the known form of the low energy amplitude required by chiral symmetry determines these constants unambiguously to be @xmath60    one can now address the origin of the large corrections found in the @xmath61 amplitude .",
    "do they arise simply from the unitarization of the amplitude ( _ i.e. _ @xmath62 ) or are new inputs needed in the amplitude ?",
    "it turns out that the rescattering physics in @xmath63 is most important , and that the main corrections are due to well - known ingredients . in our subsequent discussion",
    ", we will use a full phenomenological treatment but it is useful here to explore the case with a simple analytic form for @xmath63 . the condition @xmath64 defines the [ 0,1 ] pad approximation for the omns function @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath65 and allows one an approximate but simple analytic representation for the @xmath32 amplitude .",
    "the constant @xmath66 is chosen to match the small @xmath45 behavior of the experimental @xmath67 function , and @xmath68 is chosen from a fit to @xmath69 @xmath35 scattering .",
    "the resulting form for the @xmath61 amplitude is @xmath70\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 4\\over 3f_\\pi^2}(l_9^r+l_{10}^r)s ( d_0^{-1}(s)-d_2^{-1}(s))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , when the pad forms of @xmath71 are used , provides a consistent analytic solution to the dispersion relation while also displaying the correct chiral properties to @xmath72 . in figure 1 , we plot the resulting cross section , in comparison with the data and the lowest order result .",
    "it can be seen that the omns functions produce a substantial modification even near threshold .",
    "of these , the most important is @xmath67 which reflects the strong attractive @xmath35 scattering in the @xmath73 channel @xcite .",
    "a much more satisfactory fit is found by use of an omns function @xmath74 determined via the use of _ experimental _ values of the pion - pion phase shifts @xcite as well as including contributions to the left hand cut due to @xmath75 exchange diagrams , which leads to the very good fit given in figure 1 .",
    "details of this calculation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lesson to be learned from this example is the importance of inclusion of i=0 s - wave @xmath11 rescattering corrections especially in processes which have no counterterm contributions and are generated from a simple one - loop chiral calculation .",
    "we shall see in the next sections two additional examples of this type , when we extend our formalism to cover the nonleptonic weak - radiative decays @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "a good deal of work has been done extending the chiral formalism into the regime of nonleptonic weak processes . to two - derivative order the form of the effective su(3 )",
    "octet chiral lagrangian is unique @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant whose value can be determined empirically .",
    "the corresponding four - derivative weak effective lagrangian has also been written down and involves thirty - seven additional terms @xcite , whose explicit form will not be needed here , since as in the case of @xmath29 there is no tree level contributions to the weak - radiative decay process @xmath80 .",

    "we note that the function b(s ) has a cut along the line element @xmath87 and by unitarity has the imaginary part @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the amplitude for the weak decay @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the amplitude for s - wave radiative pion annihilation @xmath92 discussed in the previous section .",
    "note that since we are using an su(3 ) octet assumption for the weak transition , both di - pions are required to be in an isoscalar configuration . to lowest order in chiral perturbation theory",
    "we have @xmath93 we now write a doubly subtracted dispersion relation for the function @xmath94 using as subtraction constants the requirements that the amplitude vanish at both @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as given in the lowest order chiral analysis , yielding @xmath97 if the lowest order chiral values ",

    "of course , the subtraction constants must be fixed by some other means  we assume that chiral perturbation theory to one loop is accurate enough to describe the amplitude at very low energies .    the @xmath100 decay amplitude @xmath89 itself is an analytic function with a discontinuity along a cut @xmath87 given in terms of the s - wave i=0 @xmath11 scattering phase shift @xmath101 the general solution of such an equation is given @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an arbitrary polynomial and @xmath74 is the omns function discussed in section 1 . in order to determine the polynomial @xmath103 we demand that the full @xmath84 amplitude given in eq .",

    "however , a consistent calculation clearly should explain all relevant processes , @xmath112 , @xmath109 , @xmath113 , @xmath80 and @xmath77 by the same method .",
    "we have explained in detail above how this can be achieved . *",
    "the inclusion of the neutral two pion intermediate state in the unitarity relation brings an additional enhancement factor of @xmath114 . as mentioned before , this contribution is missed in all approaches where the @xmath115 vertex is treated only at the born level .",
    "although this effect is moderate , it goes in the right direction .",
    "moreover , it is critical to include the @xmath116 intermediate state in order to properly implement the constraints of unitarity .",
    "finally we note that using a twice subtracted dispersion relation , the contributions from the high energy region to the dispersive integral are very much suppressed . cutting the integral at @xmath117 instead of 1",

    "inclusion of the neutral intermediate state in the unitarity relation restores the maximum to its original location .",
    "the process @xmath120 has traditionally been a difficult one to understand within the context of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , from other successes one might have expected the one - loop chiral prediction to be accurate to @xmath121(20% ) or so , whereas in fact the predicted branching ratio is nearly a factor of three too small .",
    "previous work in this area has attempted to explain this discrepancy in terms of vector meson pole contributions and/or in terms of higher loop final state interaction effects .",
    "we have here noted , however , that previous dispersion - based final state interaction calculations have included only the intermediate @xmath122 intermediate state , omitting its potentially important @xmath116 analog . above",
