    "an understanding of the @xmath5 interaction is fundamental to studies of the more general @xmath6 problem@xcite . below 1",
    "gev , in proton laboratory kinetic energy @xmath7 for the @xmath5 system , the dominant channels contributing to @xmath5 inelasticity are @xmath4 and @xmath8@xcite . at these energies , it is useful to employ a multi - channel formalism in analyzing all existing data simultaneously . in the present work ,",
    "we have used the k - matrix formalism in order to unify the analysis of several reactions ( @xmath0@xcite , @xmath1@xcite , and @xmath2@xcite ) which we have , in the past , considered separately .",
    "the range of @xmath3 was chosen to include all of our results for the pion - induced reactions ( @xmath9 ) .    clearly , we are not the first to consider this problem . a joint analysis of these three reactions , in a narrow energy range near the @xmath8 threshold ,",
    "was recently reported by nagata et al.@xcite .",
    "this work used a mix of model - based and phenomenological results to investigate possible narrow structures in these reactions . an older work by edwards@xcite used the multi - channel k - matrix formalism to study the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states associated with dibaryon candidates .",
    "the present analysis differs from those carried out previously in a number of important respects .",
    "we did not restrict our study to partial - waves containing interesting structures .",
    "for @xmath12 elastic scattering , all waves with @xmath13 were used .",
    "partial wave with @xmath14 were retained for both @xmath4 elastic scattering and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the k - matrix parameters were determined solely from our fits to the available data bases for each separate reaction .",
    "no results of outside analyses or any model approaches were used as constraints . as a result ,",
    "the amplitudes found in our k - matrix fits are as  unbiased \" as those coming from the separate analyses@xcite .    in section  ii , we will outline the k - matrix formalism used in this analysis .",
    "the combined and separate analyses will be compared in section  iii .",
    "conclusions and suggestions for further study will be given in section  iv .",
    "in order to analyze the reaction @xmath2 along with elastic @xmath12 and @xmath4 scattering , we have constructed a k - matrix formalism having @xmath12 , @xmath4 and @xmath8 channels .",
    "the energy - dependence of our global fit was obtained through a coupled - channel k - matrix form in order to ensure that unitarity would not be violated .",
    "@xmath8 \" channel is added to account for all channels other than @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "the most important thresholds are illustrated schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "that this catch - all channel is indeed mainly @xmath8 can be seen in fig .  2 , where the total cross sections for @xmath12 and @xmath4 scattering are broken into their components .",
    "as the elastic @xmath12 partial - wave analysis is far superior to the @xmath4 elastic and @xmath2 analyses , we have carried out fits in which the @xmath12 partial - waves were held fixed .",
    "( the partial wave decomposition the of @xmath12 , @xmath4 , and @xmath15 systems are given in table  i. ) as described below , the @xmath12 amplitudes were used to fix some elements of the k - matrix , while the others were determined from a fit to the combined @xmath4 elastic and @xmath2 data bases .",
    "states of a given total angular momentum and parity ( @xmath16 ) were parameterized by a 4x4 k - matrix ( @xmath17 ) which coupled to an appropriate @xmath8 channel .",
    "spin - mixed(2x2 ) @xmath12 states couple to unmixed @xmath4 states , and unmixed @xmath12 states couple to spin - mixed(2x2 ) @xmath4 states , so the @xmath18 system is always represented by a 3x3 matrix . for example , the t - matrix ( @xmath19 ) for @xmath10 ( unmixed @xmath12 states ) is given by + @xmath12 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    whereas the t - matrix for @xmath23 ( mixed @xmath12 states ) is + @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath4 @xmath26 the subscripts @xmath27 denote states with @xmath28 . in the above ,",
    "the mixing parameters ( @xmath29 ) for elastic @xmath12 and @xmath4 scattering are different . for the reaction @xmath2 , the notation ( @xmath30 ) of ref.@xcite is used .",
    "adding an @xmath8 channel results in a 4x4 t - matrix .",
    "dropping the @xmath31-subscript , we write the k - matrix as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the elastic @xmath12 scattering sub - matrix , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are row and column vectors , and @xmath36 is the sub - matrix of channels involving @xmath4 and @xmath8 states .",
    "this k - matrix can be re - expressed as a t - matrix @xmath37 using the relation t = k(1ik)@xmath38 .",
    "we then have the correspondence @xmath39 where @xmath40 in order to ensure an exact fit to the @xmath12 elastic t - matrix , given by our most recent analysis of @xmath5 elastic scattering to 1.6  gev@xcite , we take @xmath41 the matrix elements are then expanded as polynomials in the pion energy times appropriate phase - space factors . the @xmath4 elastic and @xmath2 t - matrix elements",
    "are extracted from @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we have fitted the amplitudes for @xmath0 and the existing data bases for @xmath2 , and @xmath1 , using the k - matrix formalism outlined in section  ii .",
    "the @xmath4 elastic and @xmath1 data bases used in this analysis are described in refs.@xcite and @xcite , and available from the authors@xcite .",
    "the overall @xmath44 for our combined analysis is actually superior to that found in our single - reaction analyses .",
    "this is due to the improved parameterization scheme .",
    "a comparison is given in table  ii .",
    "we should emphasize that the amplitudes for @xmath12 elastic scattering are the same as those given in ref.@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , this feature was built into our k - matrix parameterization .",
    "for this reason , we have omitted plots of the @xmath12 amplitudes@xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath4 elastic scattering are also qualitatively similar , up to the limit of our single - energy analyses . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the main partial - waves from our single - reaction analysis@xcite and combined analysis ( solution c500 ) .",
    "significant differences begin to appear above a pion laboratory kinetic energy of 300  mev or 2.3  gev in @xmath3 .",
    "( the @xmath45 partial wave from c500 is an exception , departing from the single - reaction analysis near threshold . )",
    "the upper limit to our single - energy analyses is due to a sharp cutoff in the number of data .",
    "this is apparent in fig .  2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "much additional data above 300  mev will be required before a stable solution to 500  mev can be expected .",
    "a comparison of results for @xmath2 reveals the most pronounced differences .",
    "one reason for this is the overall phase which was left undetermined in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , we arbitrarily chose the @xmath46 wave to be real . in the present analysis , the overall phase has been determined . in fig .",
    "4 we show that the @xmath46 phase is very different in the combined and separate analyses . given the large difference in overall phase , we have chosen to compare the partial - wave amplitudes from the separate and combined analyses in terms of their moduli .",
    "this comparison is made in fig .",
    "5 . as was the case for @xmath4 elastic scattering ,",
    "differences are most significant above approximately 2.3  gev in @xmath3 .",
    "a similar lack of data exists above this energy .",
    "in general we see a good agreement for the dominant amplitudes found in the separate and combined analyses .",
    "figures 3 and 5 also display our single - energy analyses which were done in order to search for structure which may be missing from the energy - dependent fit .",
    "( details of the single - energy analyses are given in refs.@xcite . )",
    "a comparison of the single - energy and energy - dependent fits is given in tables  iii and iv .",
    "we have obtained new partial - wave amplitudes for @xmath4 elastic scattering and the reaction @xmath2 , using a k - matrix method which utilized information from our elastic @xmath12 scattering analysis .",
    "in addition to producing amplitudes more tightly constrained by unitarity , we have resolved the overall phase ambiguity existing in our previous @xmath2 analysis .    as mentioned in section iii",
    ", the combined analysis has resulted in a slightly improved fit to the @xmath4 elastic and @xmath47 data bases .",
    "the most noticeable differences , at the partial - wave level , appear at higher energies where the existing data are sparse .",
    "it is difficult to find cases where the fit has been dramatically improved .",
    "one exception is the set of @xmath4 total cross section data between 300 and 500  mev . here",
    "the combined analysis is much more successful in reproducing the energy dependence .",
    "the combined analysis gives total cross sections which begin to rise at 500  mev , whereas the separate analysis shows a fairly monotonic decrease from 400 to 500  mev .",
    "the behavior seen in the combined analysis seems reasonable , as the @xmath4 total cross sections do begin to rise just beyond the upper energy limit of our analysis .",
    "many of the individual partial - wave amplitudes from c500 show rising imaginary parts near 500  mev , a feature absent in the analysis of @xmath4 elastic data alone .",
    "the present analysis has also resulted in a unified description of the resonancelike behavior previously noted in our separate analyses of @xmath12@xcite and @xmath4@xcite elastic scattering , and the reaction @xmath2@xcite .",
    "this behavior@xcite has been variously described as `` resonant '' ( due to the creation of dibaryon resonances ) and `` pseudo - resonant '' ( due to the @xmath8 intermediate state ) .",
    "we expect that our combined analysis will further constrain models based on these two mechanisms .",
