    "the study of rare decays may be regarded as a part of the endeavour to test the principles of symmetry and symmetry - breaking underlying the standard model of weak interactions . in any theory based on symmetries ,",
    "the most important numbers are the `` ones '' and `` zeros '' , the intensity rules and selection rules . in the case of the standard model , the ones and zeros",
    "are associated with the unitarity of the quark - mixing matrix , e.g. @xmath10 physically , eq .",

    "these triangles have diverse shapes , corresponding to the diversity of the elements @xmath16 .",
    "there is , however , a unity in this diversity : all unitarity triangles have the same area @xmath17 , as a consequence of the fact that @xmath18 unitary matrices have an invariant property given by the jarlskog parameter @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this invariant is a universal measure of @xmath15 violation in weak phenomena .",
    "in addition , the existence of unitarity triangles implies a unification of @xmath15-violating and @xmath15-conserving observables .",
    "the sides of a triangle are determined by the moduli @xmath25 , measurable in @xmath15-conserving processes .",
    "knowledge of the sides fixes the angles , which are measures of @xmath15 violation .",
    "this property , as well as the universal area of unitarity triangles , is a feature specific to a world with three generations .",

    "the unitarity of the matrix @xmath28 ensures the absence of non - diagonal terms .",
    "however , the symmetries which lead to the fcnc zero are broken in the standard model by yukawa couplings of the scalar doublet @xmath29 to fermions . for a typical doublet @xmath30 ,",
    "the yukawa interaction is @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( note that @xmath34 is very nearly unity ) .",
    "these yukawa couplings break chiral symmetry and give rise to a fcnc interaction like @xmath35 at the level of one - loop ( box and penguin ) diagrams .",

    "( [ heffin21 ] ) is then @xmath47 ( \\overline{d } s)_{v - a } ( \\overline{\\nu } \\nu)_{v - a}\\ ] ] this expression reveals the two types of forces that are at work in fcnc decays : gauge forces associated with the gauge coupling @xmath48 and yukawa forces associated with the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath34 .",
    "the latter force is independent of the gauge coupling , and exists even when @xmath49 is switched off .",
    "it is the subtle interplay of these forces that one is testing in the study of fcnc processes .    a thorough analysis of the decays",

    "the first reaction can be used to obtain @xmath50 and hence @xmath51^{1/2}$ ] , the second determines the @xmath15-violating parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the two together can localise the @xmath4 coordinates of the unitarity triangle , and provide a consistency check of the @xmath53 domain delineated by @xmath54-decays .",
    "the predicted branching ratios are @xmath55 ( to be compared with the experimental result @xmath56 based on 3 events from the e949 and e787 experiments@xcite ) , and @xmath57      these decays receive contributions from three sources : ( a ) a @xmath15-violating short - distance interaction @xmath58 , ( b ) a @xmath15-conserving two - photon contribution associated with the decay @xmath59 , ( c ) an indirect @xmath15-violating contribution associated with a one - photon transition @xmath60 .",
    "accordingly , the decay amplitude has the structure @xmath61 the coefficients @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 have similar order of magnitude ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "data on the branching ratio and @xmath69 spectrum of @xmath59 enable an estimate of @xmath70 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath71 state appears to be mainly @xmath72 implies that @xmath70 is of importance mainly for the @xmath73 channel . the indirect @xmath15-violating amplitude @xmath74 is fixed ( up to a model - dependent sign ) by the observed branching ratio for @xmath75@xcite .",
    "a recent analysis obtains the prediction@xcite @xmath76      the decay @xmath6 is subject to a unitarity bound associated with the @xmath71 intermediate state@xcite , given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath79 is just @xmath80 above the unitarity limit : @xmath81 this excess can be interpreted as an estimate of the quantity @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dispersive part of the @xmath71 contribution , and @xmath84 is the contribution of the short - distance interaction @xmath85 .",
    "such an analysis requires a model for the form factor of the two - photon vertex @xmath86@xcite . in principle , access to the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath87 amplitude is also possible by studying the decay @xmath88 in the soft - photon region where the bremsstrahlung and dalitz pair amplitudes for this process interfere@xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath8 is calculable in terms of empirical knowledge of the radiative transition @xmath89 .",
    "it reveals a remarkable @xmath15-violating , @xmath90-odd asymmetry , which is triggered by the small @xmath91 impurity in the @xmath92 wave - function@xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 amplitude is the sum of a bremsstrahlung component , proportional to the @xmath15-violating parameter @xmath93 , and a direct @xmath94 term obtained by a fit to the photon energy spectrum .",
    "the @xmath95 pair in @xmath8 is interpreted as an internal conversion of the photon in @xmath89 .",
    "the theoretical analysis leads to the prediction @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the angle between the @xmath98 and @xmath95 planes .",
    "the last term is odd under @xmath15 as well as @xmath90 , and gives rise to an asymmetry @xmath99 the predicted value was @xmath100@xcite , and is in excellent agreement with the measured value@xcite @xmath101 in addition , the distribution of the @xmath98 system in the final state confirms the presence of an @xmath102-wave amplitude , corresponding to a mean - square @xmath103 charge radius @xmath104 in agreement with the theoretical expectation from vector meson dominance : @xmath105 = -0.07 \\ , fm^2 $ ] .",
    "these decays are determined mainly by the single photon intermediate state .",
    "the matrix elements have a similarity to that for the charged current decay @xmath108 , and may be parametrised as @xmath109    an early analysis@xcite yielded the prediction @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "a simple model of @xmath106 relates the matrix element to the weak two point vertex @xmath112 and the charge radii of @xmath113 and @xmath114@xcite .",
    "a similar model was used a long time ago@xcite to estimate the decay @xmath107 in terms of the weak vertex @xmath115 and the charge radius of the @xmath103 meson . the @xmath112 and @xmath115 vertices are given by current algebra and pcac : @xmath116 where @xmath49 is the coupling constant for @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . with these values , the measured branching ratios of @xmath106 and @xmath75 are well reproduced .",
    "as noted above , the standard model contains gauge couplings @xmath119 , which conserve chirality , and yukawa couplings @xmath120 which are proportional to fermion masses and violate chirality .",
    "it is the interplay of those couplings that determines the strength of the fcnc interaction responsible for decays like @xmath1 .",
    "the reality of the yukawa interaction as a force independent of gauge interactions is revealed if one considers the  gaugeless \" limit of the standard model , viz .",
    "@xmath121 with @xmath122 fixed . in this limit ,",
    "studied by bjorken@xcite , one has the remarkable consequence that the electron is unstable , with decay width @xmath123 note that in the limit @xmath121 , @xmath124 .",
    "the electron decays purely by virtue of its yukawa coupling @xmath125 , and the massless ( longitudinal ) @xmath126 it decays into is nothing but the massless goldstone boson @xmath127 of the scalar sector .    in a similar spirit",
    ", one can investigate the behaviour of amplitudes in the limit @xmath128 with @xmath129 fixed .",
    "a remarkable feature that emerges is that the electron chirality is not conserved .",
    "this is evident already at the level of qed : the cross section of helicity - flip compton scattering is @xmath130 likewise , helicity - flip bremsstrahlung @xmath131 has the characteristic angular distribution@xcite @xmath132 which , integrated over angles , gives a finite non - zero result in the limit @xmath9 .    as a further interesting consequence@xcite electrons in radiative muon decay @xmath133",
    "are not purely left - handed in the limit @xmath9 . despite the @xmath134 structure of the weak interaction ,",
    "there is a significant probability for electrons in @xmath135-decay to be right - handed .",
    "such right - handed electrons are typically accompanied by hard collinear photons .",
    "the contribution of these wrong - helicity electrons to the muon decay width is @xmath136 .",
    "the above curiosities in the gaugeless limit or in the limit of a massless fermion may be of some relevance when one contemplates the interplay of gauge couplings and yukawa couplings in electroweak amplitudes .",
