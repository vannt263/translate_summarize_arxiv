    "the axelrod model is one of the most popular agent - based models of cultural dynamics .",
    "in addition to a spatial structure , which is modeled through a graph in which vertices represent individuals and edges potential dyadic interactions between two individuals , it includes two important social factors : social influence and homophily .",
    "the former is the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they interact , while the latter is the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar .",
    "note that the voter model @xcite accounts for social influence since an interaction between two individuals results in a perfect agreement between them .",
    "the voter model , however , excludes homophily . to also account for this factor",
    ", one needs to be able to define a certain opinion or cultural distance between any two individuals through which the frequency of the interactions between the two individuals can be measured . in the model proposed by political scientist robert axelrod @xcite ,",
    "each individual is characterized by her opinions on @xmath0 different cultural features , each of which assumes @xmath1 possible states .",
    "homophily is modeled by assuming that pairs of neighbors interact at a rate equal to the fraction of cultural features for which they agree , and social influence by assuming that , as a result of the interaction , one of the cultural features for which members of the interacting pair disagree ( if any ) is chosen uniformly at random , and the state of one of both individuals is set equal to the state of the other individual for this cultural feature .",
    "more formally , the axelrod model on the one - dimensional lattice is the continuous - time markov chain whose state space consists of all spatial configurations @xmath4 that map the vertex set viewed as the set of all individuals into the set of cultures . to describe the dynamics of the axelrod model , it is convenient to introduce @xmath5 where @xmath6 refers to the @xmath7th coordinate of the vector @xmath8 , which denotes the fraction of cultural features the two vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 share . to describe the elementary transitions of the spatial configuration",
    ", we also introduce the operator @xmath11 defined on the set of configurations by @xmath12 in other words , configuration @xmath13 is obtained from configuration @xmath14 by setting the @xmath7th feature of the individual at vertex @xmath9 equal to the @xmath7th feature of the individual at vertex @xmath10 and leaving the state of all the other features in the system unchanged .",
    "the dynamics of the axelrod model is then described by the markov generator @xmath15 defined on the set of cylinder functions by @xmath16 { \\mathbf{1}}\\bigl\\{\\eta(x , i ) \\neq \\eta(y , i ) \\bigr\\ } \\bigl[f ( \\sigma_{x , y , i } \\eta ) - f ( \\eta)\\bigr].\\ ] ] the expression of the markov generator indicates that the conditional rate at which the @xmath7th feature of vertex @xmath9 is set equal to the @xmath7th feature of vertex @xmath10 given that these two vertices are nearest neighbors that disagree on their @xmath7th feature can be written as @xmath17 = f ( x , y ) \\times \\frac{1}{f   ( 1 - f ( x , y ) ) } \\times \\frac{1}{2},\\ ] ] which , as required , is equal to the fraction of features both vertices have in common , which is the rate at which the vertices interact , times the reciprocal of the number of features for which both vertices disagree , which is the probability that any of these features is the one chosen for update , times the probability one half that vertex @xmath9 rather than vertex @xmath10 is chosen to be updated .",
    "note that , when the number of features @xmath18 , the system is static , while when the number of states per feature @xmath19 there is only one possible culture . also , to avoid trivialities",
    ", we assume from now on that the two parameters of the system are strictly larger than one .    the main question about the axelrod model is whether the system fluctuates and evolves to a global consensus or gets trapped in a highly fragmented configuration . to define this dichotomy rigorously",
    ", we say that the system fluctuates whenever @xmath20 \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{\\mbox{for all } x \\in{\\mathbb{z}}\\mbox { and } i \\in\\{1 , 2 , \\ldots , f \\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and fixates if there exists a configuration @xmath21 such that @xmath22 \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{\\mbox{for all } x \\in{\\mathbb{z}}\\mbox { and } i \\in\\{1 , 2 , \\ldots , f \\}.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , fixation means that the culture of each individual is only updated a finite number of times , so fluctuation ( [ eqfluctuation ] ) and fixation ( [ eqfixation ] ) exclude each other .",
    "we define convergence to a global consensus mathematically as a clustering of the system , that is , @xmath23 note that whether the system fluctuates or fixates depends not only on the number of cultural features and the number of states per feature , but also on the initial distribution .",
    "indeed , regardless of the parameters , the system starting from a configuration in which all the individuals agree for a given cultural feature while the states at the other cultural features are independent and occur with the same probability always fluctuates . on the other hand ,",
    "regardless of the parameters , the system starting from a configuration in which all the even sites share the same culture and all the odd sites share another culture which is incompatible with the one at even sites always fixates .",
    "also , we say that fluctuation / fixation occurs for a given pair of parameters if the one - dimensional system with these parameters fluctuates / fixates when starting from the distribution @xmath24 in which the states of the cultural features within each vertex and among different vertices are independent and uniformly distributed .",
    "we also point out that neither fluctuation implies clustering nor fixation excludes clustering in general .",
    "indeed , the voter model in dimensions larger than or equal to three for which coexistence occurs is an example of spin system that fluctuates but does not cluster while the biased voter model @xcite is an example of spin system that fixates and clusters . in spite of these counter - examples",
    ", we conjecture that fluctuation implies clustering and fixation excludes clustering for the one - dimensional axelrod model starting from the distribution @xmath24 .",
    "we now give a brief review of the previous results about the one - dimensional axelrod model and state the new results proved in this article .",
    "since two neighbors are more likely to interact as the number of cultural features increases and the number of states per feature decreases , one expects the phase transition between the fluctuation / clustering regime and the fixation / no clustering regime to be an increasing function in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "the numerical simulations together with the mean - field approximation of @xcite suggest that the system starting from @xmath24 :    * exhibits consensus ( clustering ) when @xmath25 and * gets trapped in a highly fragmented configuration ( no clustering ) when @xmath26 .",
    "looking now at analytical results , the first result in @xcite states that the one - dimensional , two - feature , two - state axelrod model clusters .",
    "the second result deals with the system on a large but finite interval , and indicates that , for a certain subset of the parameter region , the system gets trapped in a random configuration in which the expected number of cultural domains scales like the number of vertices .",
    "this strongly suggests fixation of the infinite system in this parameter region , which we prove in this paper .",
    "shortly after , lanchier and schweinsberg  @xcite realized that the analysis of the axelrod model can be greatly simplified using a coupling to translate problems about the model into problems about a certain system of random walks . to visualize this coupling ,",
    "think of each spatial configuration as a @xmath1-coloring of the set @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all @xmath29 and all cultural features @xmath7 .",
    "we call @xmath30 a blockade when it contains @xmath0 particles , or equivalently when the two individuals on each side of @xmath30 completely disagree . when the number of states per feature @xmath31 , lanchier and schweinsberg @xcite proved that construction ( [ eqcoupling ] ) induces a system of annihilating symmetric random walks that has a certain site recurrence property , which is equivalent to fluctuation of the axelrod model , when starting from @xmath24 . from this property",
    ", they also deduced extinction of the blockades and clustering , thus extending the first result of @xcite to the model with two states per feature and any number of features .",
    "in contrast , the present paper deals with the fixation part of the conjecture and extends the second result of @xcite by again using the random walk representation induced by  ( [ eqcoupling ] ) .",
    "the first step is to prove that , for all values of the parameters , construction  ( [ eqcoupling ] ) induces a system of random walks in which collisions result independently in either annihilation or coalescence with some specific probabilities .",
    "coalescing events only occur when the number of states @xmath32 .",
    "this is then combined with large deviation estimates for the initial distribution of particles to obtain survival of the blockades when starting from @xmath24 in the parameter region described in the second result of @xcite .",
    "this not only implies fixation of the infinite system , but also excludes clustering so the system gets trapped in a highly fragmented configuration .    [ thfixation - general ] assume that @xmath33 then , fixation ( [ eqfixation ] ) occurs and clustering ( [ eqclustering ] ) does not occur .",
    "-@xmath1 plane .",
    "the diagram on the left - hand side is simply an enlargement of the diagram on the right - hand side that focuses on small parameters .",
    "the continuous straight line with equation @xmath34 is the transition curve conjectured in  @xcite .",
    "the set of crosses is the set of parameters for which the conjecture has been proved analytically : the vertical line of crosses on the left - hand side of the diagrams is the set of parameters for which fluctuation and clustering have been proved in @xcite while the triangular set of crosses is the set of parameters such that @xmath35 for which fixation is proved in theorem [ thfixation - general ] .",
    "the dashed line is the straight line with equation @xmath36 where the slope @xmath37 is such that @xmath38 . ]",
    "interestingly , though the second result in @xcite relies on a coupling between the axelrod model and a certain urn problem along with some combinatorial techniques that strongly differ from the techniques in our proof , both approaches lead to the same sufficient condition ( [ eqfixation - general ] ) .",
    "the set of parameters described implicitly in condition ( [ eqfixation - general ] ) corresponds to the triangular set of crosses in the two diagrams of figure [ figdiagram ] , which we obtained using a computer program .",
    "the picture suggests that this parameter region is ( almost ) equal to the set of parameters below a certain straight line going through the origin . to find the asymptotic slope ,",
    "observe that if @xmath36 , then @xmath39 in other respects , if @xmath3 , then we have @xmath40 from which we deduce that @xmath41 this proves that the condition in the theorem holds for @xmath36 and so all @xmath2 since @xmath42 is decreasing with respect to its second variable .",
    "in particular , fixation occurs whenever @xmath43 see figure [ figdiagram ] for a picture of the straight line with equation @xmath36 .",
    "finally , though @xmath44 and therefore theorem [ thfixation - general ] does not imply fixation for the two - feature three - state axelrod model , our approach can be improved to also obtain fixation in this case .",
    "[ thfixation-2 ] the conclusion of theorem [ thfixation - general ] holds whenever @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "note that this fixation result is sharp since the first result in @xcite gives fluctuation and clustering of the two - feature two - state axelrod model in one dimension .",
    "in particular , the two - feature model fixates if and only if the number of states per feature @xmath32 . to conclude , we note that , in contrast with the techniques introduced in  @xcite that heavily relies on the fact that the system starts from @xmath24 , our proof of theorem [ thfixation - general ] easily extends to show that , starting from more general product measures , the one - dimensional system fixates under a certain assumption stronger than  ( [ eqfixation - general ] ) .",
    "however , the estimates of lemmas [ lemoutcome ] and [ lemgeneral ] , and consequently the condition for fixation , in this more general context become very messy while the proof does not bring any new interesting argument . therefore , we focus for simplicity on the most natural initial distribution @xmath24 .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , one key to understanding the axelrod model is to keep track of the disagreements between neighbors rather than the actual set of opinions of each individual . when the number of states per feature @xmath31 , this results in a collection of nonindependent systems of annihilating symmetric random walks .",
    "lanchier and schweinsberg @xcite have recently studied these systems of random walks in detail and deduced from their analysis that the two - state axelrod model clusters in one dimension .",
    "when the number of states per feature is larger than two , these systems are more complicated because each collision between two random walks can result in either both random walks annihilating or both random walks coalescing . in this section , we recall the connection between the axelrod model and systems of symmetric random walks , and complete the construction given in @xcite to also include the case @xmath32 in which coalescing events take place .    to begin with , we think of each edge of the graph as having @xmath0 levels , and place a particle on an edge at level @xmath7 if and only if the two individuals that this edge connects disagree on their @xmath7th feature .",
    "more precisely , we define the process @xmath47 and place a particle at site @xmath48 at level @xmath7 whenever @xmath49 . to describe this system ,",
    "it is convenient to also introduce the process that keeps track of the number of particles per site , @xmath50 and to call site @xmath30 a @xmath51-site whenever it contains a total of @xmath51 particles : @xmath52 . to understand the dynamics of these particles ,",
    "the first key is to observe that , since each interaction between two individuals is equally likely to affect the culture of any of these two individuals , each particle moves one unit to the right or one unit to the left with equal probability one half .",
    "because the rate at which two neighbors interact is proportional to the number of cultural features they have in common , a  particle at @xmath53 jumps at a rate that depends on the total number of particles located at site @xmath30 , which induces systems of particles which are not independent .",
    "more precisely , since two adjacent vertices that disagree on exactly @xmath51 of their features , and therefore are connected by an edge that contains a pile of @xmath51 particles , interact at rate @xmath54 , the fraction of features they share , conditional on the event that @xmath30 is a @xmath51-site , each particle at site @xmath30 jumps at rate @xmath55 which represents the rate at which both vertices interact times the probability that any of the @xmath51 particles is the one selected to jump . motivated by ( [ eqrate ] )",
    ", the particles at site @xmath30 are said to be active if the site has less than @xmath0 particles , and frozen if the site has @xmath0 particles , in which case we call @xmath30 a blockade .",
    "to complete the construction of these systems of random walks , the last step is to understand the outcome of a collision between two particles .",
    "assume that @xmath53 and @xmath56 are occupied at time @xmath57 and that the particle at @xmath53 jumps one unit to the right at time @xmath58 , an event that we call a collision and that we denote by @xmath59 this happens when the individual at @xmath60 disagrees with her two nearest neighbors on her @xmath7th feature at time @xmath57 and imitates the @xmath7th feature of her left neighbor at time @xmath58 .",
    "this collision results in two possible outcomes .",
    "if the individuals at @xmath9 and @xmath61 agree on their @xmath7th feature just after the update , or equivalently the individuals at @xmath62 and @xmath61 agree on their @xmath7th feature just before the update , then @xmath56 becomes empty so both particles annihilate , which we write @xmath63 on the other hand , if the individuals at @xmath9 and @xmath61 still disagree on their @xmath7th feature after the update , then @xmath56 is occupied at time @xmath58 so both particles coalesce , which we write @xmath64 we refer to figure [ figparticles ] for an illustration of the coupling between the four - feature , three - state axelrod model and systems of annihilating - coalescing random walks .",
    "each particle is represented by a cross and the three possible states by the colors black , grey and white . in our example",
    ", there are two jumps resulting in two collisions : an annihilating event then a coalescing event .",
    "we also refer the reader to figure [ figwalks ] for simulation pictures of the systems of random walks when @xmath65 .",
    "lanchier and schweinsberg @xcite observed that , when @xmath31 , random walks can only annihilate , which was the key to proving clustering .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in a simplistic world where there are only two possible alternatives for each cultural feature , two individuals who disagree with a third one must agree . in our context , the individuals at @xmath62 and @xmath61 must agree just before the update when @xmath31 , which results in an annihilating event .",
    "in contrast , when the number of states per feature is larger , the three consecutive vertices may have three different views on their @xmath7th cultural feature , which results in a coalescing event .",
    "we point out that , since the system of random walks collects all the times at which pairs of neighbors interact , the knowledge of the initial configuration of the axelrod model and the system of random walks up to time @xmath58 allows us to re - construct the axelrod model up to time @xmath58 regardless of the value of the parameters .",
    "there is , however , a crucial difference depending on the number of states .",
    "when @xmath31 , collisions always result in annihilating events , so knowing the configuration of the axelrod model is unimportant in determining the evolution of the random walks .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath32 , whether a collision results in a coalescing or an annihilating event depends on the configuration of the axelrod model just before the time of the collision .",
    "the key to all our results is that , in spite of this dependency , collisions result independently in either an annihilating event or a coalescing event with some fixed probabilities .",
    "in particular , the outcome of a collision is independent of the past of the system of random walks though it is not independent of the past of the axelrod model itself .    to prove this result , we need to construct the one - dimensional process graphically from a percolation structure and then define active paths which basically keep track of the descendants of the initial opinions .",
    "first , we consider the following collections of independent poisson processes and random variables : for each pair of vertex and feature @xmath66 :    * we let @xmath67 be a rate one poisson process ; * we denote by @xmath68 its @xmath69th arrival time : @xmath70 ; * we let @xmath71 be a collection of independent bernoulli variables with @xmath72 * and we let @xmath73 be a collection of independent @xmath74 .",
    "the axelrod model is then constructed as follows . at time @xmath75 , we draw an arrow labeled @xmath7 from vertex  @xmath9 to vertex @xmath76 to indicate that if @xmath77 then the individual at vertex @xmath10 imitates the @xmath7th feature of the individual at vertex  @xmath9 . in particular , as indicated in ( [ eqrate ] ) , the rate at which the imitation occurs is equal to one half times the fraction of cultural features both vertices have in common divided by the number of features for which both vertices disagree , which indeed produces the local transition rates of the axelrod model .",
    "the graphical representation defines a random graph structure , also called percolation structure , from which the process starting from any initial configuration can be constructed by induction based on an argument due to harris @xcite .",
    "each arrow in this percolation structure is said to be active if condition ( [ eqactive ] ) is satisfied .",
    "note that whether an arrow is active or not depends on the initial configuration , and that the fact that an @xmath7-arrow from vertex @xmath9 to vertex @xmath10 at time @xmath58 is active implies that the @xmath7th feature of @xmath10 must be equal to the @xmath7th feature of @xmath9 at time @xmath58 . we say that there is an active @xmath7-path from @xmath78 to @xmath79",
    "whenever there are sequences of times and vertices @xmath80 such that the following two conditions hold :    for @xmath81 , there is an active @xmath7-arrow from @xmath82 to @xmath83 at time  @xmath84 .    for @xmath85 , there is no active @xmath7-arrow that points at @xmath86 .",
    "we say that there is a generalized active path from @xmath78 to @xmath87 whenever    for @xmath81 , there is an active arrow from @xmath82 to @xmath83 at time @xmath84 .    later",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath88 and @xmath89 to indicate the existence of an active @xmath7-path and a generalized active path , respectively .",
    "conditions 1 and 2 above imply that @xmath90 moreover , because of the definition of active arrows and simple induction , the @xmath7th cultural feature of vertex @xmath9 at time @xmath58 is equal to the initial value of the @xmath7th cultural feature of @xmath91 , so we call vertex @xmath91 the ancestor of vertex @xmath9 at time @xmath58 for the @xmath7th feature . in contrast , generalized active paths , which can be seen as concatenations of active @xmath7-paths for possibly different values of @xmath7 , do not have such an interpretation , but the concept will be useful later to prove fixation .",
    "[ lemoutcome ] conditional on the realization of the system of random walks until time @xmath57 and the event that @xmath92 at time @xmath58 , we have @xmath93    let @xmath94 .",
    "due to one - dimensional nearest neighbor interactions , active @xmath7-paths can not cross each other , from which we deduce that @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the ancestor at time @xmath97 for the @xmath7th feature , that is , @xmath98 moreover , conditional on the event of a collision @xmath99 at time @xmath58 , there is a particle at @xmath53 and a particle at @xmath56 at time @xmath57 , therefore @xmath100 from ( [ eqoutcome-1 ] ) and ( [ eqoutcome-2 ] ) , we deduce that , conditional on @xmath92 at time  @xmath58 , @xmath101 in other respects , we have @xmath102 in particular , the outcome  either an annihilating event or a coalescing event  of a collision at time @xmath58 is independent of the realization of the system of random walks up to time @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , since the initial states are independent and uniformly distributed , the conditional probability of an annihilating event is equal to the conditional probability @xmath103 where @xmath104 are independent uniform random variables over @xmath105 . by conditioning on the possible values of @xmath106 , we obtain that ( [ eqoutcome-3 ] ) is equal to @xmath107 finally , since each collision results in either an annihilating event or a coalescing event , the conditional probability of a coalescing event directly follows .",

    "the expression for @xmath184 follows from the fact that initially each level of each site is independently occupied with probability @xmath185 , which implies that the @xmath179 are independent binomial random variables .",

    ", we deduce @xmath195 this , together with lemma [ lemfixation ] , implies fixation whenever @xmath175 .",
    "to begin with , note that , when @xmath196 and @xmath46 , we have @xmath197 for the comparison function @xmath150 defined in the previous section . in particular , to find a good enough upper bound for the probability of @xmath132 in the case @xmath196 and @xmath46 , one needs to define a new comparison function that also takes into account additional events that promote fixation , such as collisions between active particles and blockade formations . recall that in the comparison function of section  [ secfixation - general ] , each particle which is initially active is assigned a weight of @xmath148 , which corresponds to the worst case scenario in which the active particle hits a blockade .",
    "however , each active particle can also hit another active particle or form a new blockade with another active particle .",
    "more precisely , there are four possible outcomes for each active particle :    if the active particle hits a blockade , it is assigned a weight of @xmath148 .",
    "if the active particle coalesces with another active particle , then at most one collision with a blockade can result from this pair of particles so the pair is assigned a total weight of @xmath148 ; that is , each particle of the pair is individually assigned a weight of @xmath198 .",
    "if the active particle annihilates with another active particle , then no collision with a blockade can result from this pair so each active particle that annihilates with another active particle is assigned a weight of 0 .    if the active particle forms a blockade with another active particle , then following the same approach as in the previous section the pair is assigned a total weight equal to @xmath148 plus a geometric random variable with mean @xmath151 .    in view of cases 24 above , the weight of an active particle that either collides with another active particle or forms a blockade with another active particle is at least @xmath198 , and",
    "therefore we define a new comparison function , again denoted by @xmath199 , as follows : @xmath200 where the random variables @xmath153 are again independent geometric random variables with the same expected value @xmath201 . the value of @xmath150 when @xmath202 is the same as in the previous section whereas we distinguish between active particles that satisfy case 1 or cases 24 above . the same reasoning and construction as in section [ secfixation - general ] again",
    "imply that @xmath203 for this new comparison function . to prove that the probability of the event on the right - hand side converges to zero as @xmath133 , we follow the same strategy as for lemma [ lemgeneral ] but also find a lower bound for the probability that a particle initially active either collides with another active particle or forms a blockade with another active particle , which is done in the next lemma .    [ lemdeviation ] assume that @xmath196 and @xmath204 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath205 such that @xmath206 where @xmath174 as in lemma [ lemgeneral ] .",
    "the first step is to find a lower bound for the initial number of active particles that will either collide or form a blockade with another active particle .",
    "to do so , we introduce the following definition : an active particle initially at site @xmath48 is said to be a good particle if @xmath207 \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{\\mbox{where } \\{u , v \\ } = \\ { 2n - 1/2 , 2n + 1/2 \\ } \\mbox { for some } n \\in{\\mathbb{z}}.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , we partition the lattice @xmath208 into countably many pairs of adjacent sites , and call an active particle at time 0 a good particle if the other site of the pair is initially occupied by an active particle as well . an active particle which is not good",
    "is called a bad particle . since initially each level of each site is independently occupied with probability @xmath185 , the variables @xmath179 are independent binomial random variables , so for @xmath209 as in ( [ eqdeviation-1 ] ) we have @xmath210 where @xmath211 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath212 since in addition the events that nonoverlapping pairs of adjacent sites are initially occupied by two good particles , or one bad particle , or one blockade , or one bad particle and one blockade , or two blockades are independent , standard large deviation estimates for the binomial distribution imply that there exists a positive constant @xmath213 such that @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 denote respectively the initial number of good particles , the initial number of bad particles and the initial number of blockades in the interval @xmath217 . to estimate the probability that a pair of good particles collide or form a blockade",
    ", we first observe that , when there are only two features , the graphical representation of the axelrod model simplifies as follows : for each pair of neighbors @xmath218 , draw an arrow @xmath219 at the times of a poisson process with intensity one fourth , which is equal to half of the rate at which neighbors who agree on one cultural feature interact .",
    "if the two neighbors agree on exactly one cultural feature at the time of the interaction then the culture of the individual at vertex @xmath10 becomes the same as the culture of the individual at vertex @xmath9 . in this graphical representation , there are exactly six possible arrows that may affect the system of random walks at the pair of sites @xmath220 , namely @xmath221 the event that one of the two arrows in the first line of ( [ eqarrows ] ) appears before any of the four other ones occurs with probability two ( arrows ) over six ( arrows ) = 1/3 , and on the intersection of this event and the event that there is initially a pair of good particles at @xmath222 , the two particles either collide or form a blockade .",
    "moreover , the event that one of the two arrows in the first line appears first only depends on the realization of the graphical representation in @xmath223 in particular , parts of the graphical representation associated with nonadjacent pairs do not intersect which , by independence of the poisson processes , implies that the events that the two arrows in the first line of ( [ eqarrows ] ) appears before any of the other ones are independent for nonadjacent pairs .",
    "it follows that the initial number  @xmath224 of good particles in @xmath217 that either collide or form a blockade is stochastically larger than a binomial random variable with @xmath225 trials and success probability one third .",
    "large deviation estimates for the binomial distribution then imply that @xmath226 for a suitable constant @xmath227 .",
    "now , let @xmath186 be the event that @xmath228 and observe that there exists a constant @xmath188 such that , on the event @xmath186 , @xmath229 in particular , letting @xmath167 be the integer part of @xmath230 , we have @xmath231 in other respects , recalling the definition of @xmath232 for @xmath233 , we have @xmath234 which , recalling the definition of @xmath235 , is equal to @xmath236 for all @xmath204 . in particular , there exists @xmath162 small such that @xmath237 since @xmath238 , the previous estimate , ( [ eqdeviation-4 ] ) and lemma [ lemgeometric ] imply that @xmath239 for all @xmath167 sufficiently large . combining ( [ eqdeviation-2 ] ) , ( [ eqdeviation-3 ] ) and ( [ eqdeviation-5 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath240 for all @xmath118 sufficiently large , which completes the proof .    as in the previous section , ( [ eqinclusion-2 ] ) and lemma [ lemdeviation ]",
