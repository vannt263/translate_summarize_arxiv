    "the subject of this discussion is total hadronic cross - section in @xmath2 collisions . at high energies this",
    "is essentially given by @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 ( @xmath8 hadrons ) .",
    "further it is also established that the major contribution to the hadron production in 2@xmath9 processes at high energies , comes from the hadronic structure of the photon  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , recent data on @xmath10 has shown  @xcite that the cross - section rises with @xmath11 just like the @xmath9p  @xcite and pp/@xmath12p  @xcite case .",
    "@xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total hadronic cross - section @xmath7 ( @xmath16 hadrons ) and @xmath17 are the flux factors for @xmath9 in @xmath18/@xmath19 .",
    "hence it is clear that the @xmath20 dependence of @xmath15 controls the rate of the rise of @xmath21 with @xmath22 and this knowledge is necessary to estimate the hadronic backgrounds due to the 2@xmath9 processes at the future linear colliders .",
    "it has been pointed out that these can threaten to spoil the clean environment of an lc  @xcite ; particularly at high energy @xmath2 colliders like clic as well as the @xmath3 colliders  @xcite that are being discussed . apart from this pragmatic need for a good model to extrapolate the @xmath23 at high energies",
    ", the 2@xmath9 system also provides an additional theoretical laboratory to test our models of calculating @xmath24 . understanding the observed rise with energy of all the hadronic cross - sections in a qcd based picture is a theoretical challenge .",
    "since the cross - sections of photon induced processes  @xcite show some special features , such studies increase our understanding of the photon as well .",
    "the dramatic improvement in the state of the data on @xmath23  @xcite from the study of 2@xmath9 processes at lep has already helped provide discrimination among predictions of theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "there exist two types of theoretical models  @xcite for calculation of @xmath15 ; what we can call loosely as ( i ) ` photon is like a proton ' models  @xcite and ( ii ) qcd based models  @xcite . in the first class of models ,",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath3 cross - sections is essentially similar to that for pp/@xmath12p . in ref .",
    "@xcite the total @xmath3 cross - section is assumed to be described in the form @xmath25 the powers @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed to be universal and hence the same as those for pp/@xmath12p ; @xmath27=0.079 and @xmath26=0.467 .",
    "@xmath28 is determined by assuming factorization ,   @xmath29 = @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath31 .",
    "the values @xmath32 , @xmath33 are taken from fits to ( pp ) @xmath12p and @xmath9p data in a form similar to that given by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "@xcite has a more elaborate treatment , but their final predictions for @xmath34 follow a pattern similar to equation ( 2 ) .",
    "bsw  @xcite predictions just assume @xmath34 = a @xmath35 and try to estimate a. aspen model  @xcite and glmn model  @xcite actually are a mixture of qcd based models , to be described later , and treating the photon like a proton .",
    "it is assumed in these models that the rise of total @xmath36 cross - section is caused by increased number of parton collisions in photons .",
    "however , all the parameters of the model for photons are obtained from those for protons using the ideas of quark model .",
    "thus , their predictions of @xmath20 dependence of @xmath37 are similar to those of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the models which are based on qcd use the information on the photon structure obtained experimentally as crucial inputs . in bkks model",
    "@xcite @xmath34 is related to @xmath38 . in the eikonalised minijet model  @xcite ,",
    "the total eikonalized cross - section for @xmath24(a+b @xmath39 hadrons ) is written as @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 can be taken to be @xmath42 0 and the imaginary part of the eikonal , @xmath43 given by @xmath44\\ ] ] in equation ( 4 ) above , @xmath45 ( s ) is the nonperturbative , soft cross - section of hadronic size which is fitted , @xmath46(b ) is the overlap function of the partons in the two hadrons a and b in the transverse space , @xmath47 is the product of the probabilities that the projectiles a and b hadronize , @xmath48 being unity if either a or b is a hadron and is @xmath49 o(@xmath50 ) for a photon .",
    "the qcd input is in the quantity @xmath51 which can be symbolically written as @xmath52 @xmath53 are the qcd inputs .",
    "the very steep rise of @xmath54 wih _ s _ is tempered by the eikonal function , such that unitarity bound is satisfied .",
    "the modelling aspect is in the choice of @xmath55 and ansatz for @xmath46(b ) .",
    "we take @xmath56 and @xmath57 = @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath46(b ) is normally taken to be fourier transform ( f.t . ) of the product of the e.m .",
    "form factors of the colliding hadrons . for a photon , instead of modelling it through the f.t . of the pion form factor , as done previously  @xcite , we take it to be the f.t . of the internal @xmath59 distribution of the partons in the photon as measured by zeus  @xcite . in our model",
    "@xcite we determined the soft parameter for @xmath3 through a quark model ansatz and used @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are fitted to the @xmath9p data .",
    "in aspen model  @xcite the formulation is the same as in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "however , @xmath63 is completely decided by using that for protons and quark model ideas . other model which uses the emm formulation  @xcite actually tries to calculate @xmath46(b ) from qcd resummation and is even more close to qcd than the formulation discussed earlier  @xcite .",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ f : rgpar:1 ] shows the @xmath9p data  @xcite along with a band of emm model predictions  @xcite .",
    "the figure includes the old photoproduction data before and from hera     cross - section as well as bpc data extrapolated from dis(left panel ) and prediction for the @xmath3 case ( right panel ) correpsonding to the parameters for the topmost curve for the @xmath64 case in the left panel.,title=\"fig : \" ]   cross - section as well as bpc data extrapolated from dis(left panel ) and prediction for the @xmath3 case ( right panel ) correpsonding to the parameters for the topmost curve for the @xmath64 case in the left panel.,title=\"fig : \" ]    experiments , as well as the bpc extrapolation of the dis data from hera  @xcite , along with the latest , preliminary data  @xcite from zeus .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 controls the b dependence of @xmath46(b ) and @xmath66 in the legend in the figure corresponds to @xmath61 of equation ( 7 ) .",
    "note here that the experimentally measured value of @xmath65 is @xmath65 = 0.66 @xmath67 0.22 gev  @xcite .",
    "we then use @xmath68 determined from @xmath69 as in equation ( 7 ) and calculate @xmath34 for the choice of parameters which correspond to the upper edge of the band in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f : rgpar:1 ] .",
    "the right panel in fig .",
    "[ f : rgpar:1 ] shows the prediction along with the latest compilation of the 2@xmath9 data on @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "one sees from the figure that the values of the parameters which give a good fit to the @xmath36 data actually predict a normalisation for @xmath9p data higher by @xmath70 .",
    "the situation should clarify once the newer photoproduction data from hera firm up .",
    "of course , variations of the parameters within the limits allowed by the @xmath9p data give a band of predictions for the emm model for @xmath3 case .",
    "this band of predictions is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : rgpar:2 ] where alongwith the emm model predictions  @xcite the predictions of various other models  @xcite are shown too .",
    "we observe that in general the data on @xmath15 seem to rise faster than the predictions of most of the ` photon like a proton ' models .",
    "the data certainly seems to rise faster than the @xmath35/@xmath71 with @xmath11 .",
    "predictions of different qcd based models  @xcite reproduce the data to a similar degree of satisfaction  ] .",
    "the question to ask now is how can the future lc help us distinguish between the various models in the @xmath2 mode and in the compton mode .",
    "in view of the inherent experimental uncertainties in unfolding @xmath36 cross - sections @xmath15 from the measured hadronic cross - sections in @xmath2 collisions @xmath5 , of course the compton colliders will offer the best discriminatory power .",
    ".predictions for different ` proton - like ' models .",
    "grv , grs correspond to the parametrisations of the photonic parton densities given in refs .",
    "@xcite respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : rgpar:2 ]    tables 1 and 2 show  @xcite the precision required to distinguish at 1 @xmath72 level between different models based on factorisation and various predictions of qcd based models respectively .",
    "the ` pseudo ' datapoints with error bars  @xcite expected at a compton collider with an @xmath2 collider of tesla design , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : rgpar:2 ] .",
    "this clearly shows that a compton collider with a parent @xmath2 collider of @xmath11 = 500 gev , can certainly distinguish between the different theoretical models and provide an opportunity to learn about the interactions of high energy photons .",
    "however , the discriminatory power is not lost even if one considers only the @xmath2 option .",
    "this can be seen by calculating @xmath5 .",
    "recall that @xmath5 is given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the photon spectra @xmath73 receive contributions from both bremstrahlung ( weizcker - williams - ww ) photons and beamstrahlung .",
    "the ww spectra with which one folds @xmath34 have to take into account the ( anti ) tagging conditions at @xmath2 colliders as well as inclusion of the effect of virtuality of tageed photon on the cross - section  @xcite .",
    "major uncertainties in the unfolding of @xmath15 from @xmath5 come from modelling the behaviour of the hadronic system that is boosted in the beam direction and lost to the detectors .",
    "hence one way of making comparisons with data free of this modelling is to make predictions for @xmath21 by restricting the integration region in equation ( 1 ) to regions of @xmath20 where these uncertainties are least .",
    "[ f : rgpar:4 ] shows @xmath21 as a function of @xmath74 , where the     as a function of @xmath20 . ]",
    "bands show the range of predictions by using @xmath23 ( @xmath75 ) from different theoretical models .",
    "the lower edge corresponds to models which treat ` photon like a proton ' and the upper edge to the qcd based models .",
    "the upper band corresponds to the predictions when no ( anti ) tagging requirement has been imposed on the @xmath9 spectra .",
    "the lower band represents the more realistic predictions by assuming for the nlc , @xmath76 = 0.025 rad and @xmath77 = 0.20 @xmath78 .",
    "this causes @xmath79 reduction in the rates for @xmath80 = 9 gev .",
    "note that , the differences in @xmath81 of factor @xmath49 2 - 3 for different models is reduced to @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "however , the demands on precision required to discriminate between different theoretical models are still very much within the reach of the lc measurements even for the @xmath84 mode . in the calculation",
    "i present here * only * the contribution of bremsstrahlung photons is included .",
    "the inclusion of the beamstrahlung photons might increase the discriminatory power , but that needs to be investigated .",
    "we can summarise our discussions as follows :    1 .   models which treat photon like a proton tend to predict a rise of cross - sections @xmath15 with energy slower than shown by @xmath3 data .",
    "qcd based models predict a faster rise .",
    "2 .   @xmath9p data seems also to show tendency of needing a value of @xmath27 ( @xmath85 ) higher than that for pp/@xmath12p .",
    "3 .   extraction of @xmath34 ( @xmath86 ) from data is no mean task .",
    "4 .   accurate measurements of @xmath34 at a @xmath36 collider will be capable of distinguishing between these different models .",
    "a precision of @xmath87 is required for that .",
    "when folded with bremstrahlung spectra the difference of 200 - 300 @xmath88 at high @xmath11 in @xmath15 in different models reduces to @xmath89 .",
    "the issue needs to be investigated for high energy @xmath2 colliders including the effects of beamstrahlung .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organisers for an excellent meeting .",
