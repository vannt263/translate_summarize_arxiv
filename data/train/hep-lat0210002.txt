    "the complexity of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) originates from the random character of the gauge field in the low - energy regime , while at high energy ( small scales ) the theory is asymptotically free .",
    "one of the most successful approaches to analyse qcd in the non - perturbative domain is the lattice formulation due to wilson @xcite , where the strong coupling regime becomes natural . on the other hand ,",
    "the continuum limit of lattice qcd corresponds to the weakly - coupled regime .",
    "it was shown by gross and witten @xcite that two - dimensional lattice qcd can be solved exactly in the large-@xmath1 limit and there is a third - order weak- to strong - coupling phase transition .",
    "the problem , which persists over the years is , if such a phase transition occurs in the realistic @xmath2 four - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "one of the ways to attack this problem is to use some form of _ duality _ @xcite which appears in the lattice theory .",
    "the general idea of duality is that a given theory can have two , or more equivalent formulations , with different sets of fundamental variables .",
    "usually these dual formulations are related by interchanging a parameter , e.g. the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath3 , with its inverse @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in the weak - coupling limit , the action of the abelian lattice gauge model can be approximated by the villain form ( see e.g. @xcite ) which allows to define the dual variables .",
    "similarly , it was shown that there is a duality transformation from the compact @xmath5 gauge theory into a non - compact abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "the dual variables are in general not defined on the original lattice but on a _",
    "dual lattice_. for a hypercubic lattice , it is obtained by shifting the original lattice by half of the lattice spacing in all dimensions .",
    "thus , the lattice duality not only transforms the variables of the functional integral , but also incorporates a transfer to the dual lattice .    in the case of a nonabelian lattice gauge theory",
    ", one can reformulate the model in terms of plaquette variables @xcite .",
    "recently , following the idea of @xcite , diakonov and petrov @xcite applied a fourier transformation to write down the jacobian from the link variables to the plaquette variables in @xmath6 gluodynamics for the gauge group su@xmath7 ; _ in fine _ the dual lattice is composed of tetrahedra representing @xmath8-symbols , with links of arbitrary lengths . in the continuum limit this effective theory is equivalent with quantum gravity with the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "unfortunately , this scheme seems difficult to apply to higher - rank gauge groups and in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "another approach to analyze non - perturbative qcd is to start from a `` simpler '' theory which contains auxiliary fields coupled to the gauge fields , and `` induce '' the nonabelian lattice gauge action by integrating over the auxiliary fields .",
    "several qcd - inducing models were proposed , with an auxiliary field living either in the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xcite , or in the adjoint representation @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "one recovers wilson s action when the mass of the auxiliary field goes to infinity . in the latter case",
    ", one can solve the large-@xmath1 limit , but the adjoint representation implies an extra local @xmath10 symmetry which leads to an infinite string tension @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we discuss another approach to treat a similar type of inducing model .",
    "our construction starts from an inducing theory similar with @xcite , already introduced in @xcite , and applies a certain duality transformation , namely the `` color  flavor transformation '' @xcite .",
    "we have recently applied this transformation to the lattice su@xmath11 model in the strong - coupling limit , which describes quarks coupled with a background gauge field @xcite .",
    "after this work was completed , we learnt that schlittgen and wettig independently applied the su@xmath12 color - flavor transformation to a similar , yet different qcd - inducing model @xcite .",
    "we consider a euclidean u@xmath11 pure gauge action ( no quarks ) in @xmath13 dimensions , placed on a hypercubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of u@xmath11 instead of the realistic su@xmath11 highly simplifies the subsequent color - flavor transformation .",
    "the lattice sites are labeled by integer vectors @xmath15 , the gauge matrix variables @xmath16 are placed on the lattice links @xmath17 ( we label links by their _ middle points _ ) , leaving the site @xmath18 in any of the `` positive '' directions @xmath19 .",
    "the plaquettes are either labeled by an independent index @xmath20 , or by triplets of the form @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , the plaquette @xmath22 contains the links @xmath17 and @xmath23 . to fix an ordering between the directions",
    ", we will in general assume that @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the same plaquette corresponds to the triplets @xmath22 and @xmath25 ( as well as two other triplets ) .",
    "the wilson pure gauge action is given by a sum over all elementary plaquettes : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the lattice coupling , which is related to the bare continuum coupling constant @xmath28 through @xmath29 the plaquette field @xmath30 is defined as an ordered product of the link variables along the boundary of the given plaquette : @xmath31 the partition function is defined as @xmath32 the invariant measure of integration is defined as a product over all links @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the haar measure on the group u@xmath11 .    using a generalized baker - campbell - hausdorff formula",

    "it is possible to explicitly transfer the integration from link to plaquette matrices @xcite , but this procedure is technically involved and can be applied only in a few simple cases .",
    "we would like to investigate a possibility to apply another approach , which starts from a modification of the qcd inducing model of bander and hamber @xcite .",
    "let us consider a massive complex bosonic field @xmath41 placed on the lattice sites @xmath18 .",
    "this field has `` flavor''components @xmath42 associated to each of the @xmath43 plaquette @xmath44 adjacent to the site @xmath18 ( see figures  [ def - fields],[ind - link ] ) .",
    "the field furthermore decomposes into two ` chiral components ' @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are hopping in opposite directions .",
    "these fields will be referred as ` left ' and ` right ' respectively .",
    "the chiral bosonic field can be thought of as an @xmath47-component vector in an auxiliary ` flavor ' space ( here the index @xmath48 stands for ` bosonic ' ) .",
    "the number of ` flavors ' has to be a multiple of @xmath43 , that is the dimension of the ` flavor ' space is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number of ` generations ' of the bosonic field .",
    "the bosonic field @xmath51 also transforms as a vector through the gauge group @xmath0 , so it contains ` color indices ' @xmath52 besides the ` flavor ' indices @xmath53 .",
    "all flavor components have the same mass @xmath54 .    ( 13,7 ) ( 1.0,0.0 ) [ def - fields ]    this model ( already considered in ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) ) is different from the model usually considered in induced qcd @xcite , where the flavor degrees of freedom of the auxiliary fields are not associated with plaquettes . as we will show below",
    ", this structure will induce a wilson - type action in a cleaner way than in the previous models .    to complete our notations",
    ", we shall fix the orientation of the plaquettes , in order to define the hopping and ` left ' and the ` right ' components in all @xmath55-dimensional planes on the lattice . on any plane @xmath56 with @xmath24",
    "the ` left ' chiral component hops on the plaquette @xmath22 as @xmath57 and the ` right ' chiral component hops in the opposite direction ( see fig .  [ ind - plaq ] ) .",
    "this practically means that the ` kinetic ' part of the action contains the term @xmath58 ( cf .",

    "we can treat plaquettes separately , since each field component is associated with one and only plaquette .",
    "the integration over the ` left ' auxiliary fields in ( [ action - boson-1 ] ) yields @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of ` generations ' of the auxiliary fields .",

    "we assumes it remains small enough to justify the expansion .",

    "it is possible to consider a fermionic counterpart of the bosonic action , which induces a similar pure gauge effective action .",
    "one has to replace the bosonic auxiliary fields by fermionic ( anticommuting ) fields @xmath80 , @xmath81 which carry color indices and flavor indices related to plaquettes , exactly as for the multiplets ; one can consider @xmath82 ` generations ' of these fermions .",

    "clearly , we once more recover the conventional wilson action ( [ action ] ) for small values of @xmath86 .",
    "having considered both bosonic and fermionic induced lattice gluodynamics , we can also represent the effective action as the ratio of ` fermionic ' and  bosonic determinants : @xmath87 \\approx   \\frac{\\left[{\\operatorname{det}}(1+\\beta_f u_p){\\operatorname{det}}(1+\\beta_f u_p^\\dagger)\\right]^{n_f } } { \\left[{\\operatorname{det}}(1-\\beta_b u_p){\\operatorname{det}}(1-\\beta_b u_p^\\dagger)\\right]^{n_b}}.\\ ] ] thus , for small couplings @xmath71 , @xmath86 , the partition function can be represented by the following superintegral @xmath88.\\ ] ] the composite field @xmath89 includes both bosonic and fermionic variables , which are distinguished by the ` flavor ' index @xmath14 .",

    "this assumption simplifies the application of the color - flavor transformation @xcite .",
    "let us consider the interaction term of the bosonic action ( [ z - boson ] ) on a given link @xmath92 of the @xmath13-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",

    "now we will rather decompose the full action into a sum over _ links _ , which forces us to gather the auxiliary bosonic fields into two series of _ site - link multiplets _ , in order to include all fields coupled by @xmath40 or @xmath94 .",
    "we thus define two chirally - conjugated multiplets associated with the site @xmath18 and the link @xmath92 :    @xmath95    the multiplets @xmath96 and @xmath97 associated with the site @xmath18 and link @xmath98 are obtained from the ones above by flipping the _ first _",
