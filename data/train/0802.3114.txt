    "in this paper we present a semiclassical theory of the interaction of a single two - level atom with a single mode of the field in which the atom is treated as a quantum two - level system and the field is treated classically .",

    "+ we propose a simple model of feedforward ( open - loop ) control for two - level atom in the external one - dimensional optical field .",
    "+ we use the so - called `` semi - classical model '' of the atom - field interaction that describes a single quantum two - level atomic system ( all other levels are neglected ) with classical electromagnetic field .",
    "we use the standard notation following @xcite , but in our model the optical field plays the role of a control signal @xmath1 for open - loop ( feedforward ) control scheme @xcite .",
    "recently other authors studied the control of two - level atoms in the frame of open - loop ideology when the controlling field was known a priori .",
    "it allowed to get the different forms of atomic energy spectra , producing @xmath2- and @xmath3- pulses @xcite , taking special non - constant shapes of external field @xcite etc .",
    "we consider the quantum two - level atomic system in the classical optical field @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the upper and lower level states of the atom , i.e. , they are eigenstates of the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian @xmath7 with the eigenvalues : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "+ the equations of motion for the density matrix elements are given by @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the matrix element of the electric dipole moment , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the decay constants , @xmath15 is a decay rate including elastic collisions between atoms , and @xmath16 is the atomic transition frequency .",
