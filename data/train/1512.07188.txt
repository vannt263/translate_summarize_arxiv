    "the remarkable progress in high power laser technology raises the question , how the expected tens of petawatt @xcite or even exawatt @xcite laser facilities can be used for fundamental research .",
    "one of the widely discussed suggestions is strong field quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which becomes observable @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss another problem , the use of high power lasers for investigation of gravity .",
    "namely , we study ions , accelerated by ultra strong laser pulse , as a source of gravitational waves ( gw)@xcite , a prediction of einstein s general theory of relativity .    from the 1960s , there were attempts to detect gw coming from space first with weber resonant detectors @xcite in the frequency range @xmath0 hz , later with interferometers such as ligo @xcite or virgo @xcite in the frequency range @xmath1 hz to @xmath2 khz .",
    "later , the so called gw hertz experiments were considered , which consist of the generation and detection of gw under laboratory conditions using for gw generation nuclear explosion @xcite or particle accelerator @xcite , see more examples in @xcite .",
    "recently it was suggested to use ions accelerated by laser field as terrestrial generator of gw@xcite .",
    "such waves would emit gw in the frequency range of ghz to thz .",
    "in forthcoming laser facilities @xcite the speed of accelerated ions would be close to the speed of light , and in this paper a relativistic approach is used to investigate gw .",
    "gw from the astrophysical event , merging of two black holes , were registered recently by ligo collaboration @xcite .",
    "however the generation of gw in the laboratory would provide outstanding opportunities for investigation of this phenomenon . in the present paper",
    "we will study the possibility of such generation with forthcoming laser facilities .",
    "gravitational waves have also been linked to high power lasers in the recent paper @xcite , where gw from electron - positron pairs , created by strong electromagnetic field were considered .",
    "since gw are very weak , the linear approximation of einstein equations is used @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dalembert operator , @xmath5 is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath6 is the metric tensor , @xmath7 is the metric of the minkowski spacetime , and @xmath8 is the perturbation of the flat spacetime , caused by gravitational waves , @xmath9 is the gravitational constant and @xmath10 is the speed of light .",
    "we use gaussian units throughout .",
    "the gravitational waves are assumed to be plane waves because of the large distance from the source as compared to wavelength .",
    "we consider two models of ion acceleration .",
    "first of them is the piston model @xcite , which describes laser acceleration of a thick plasma target .",
    "electrons are pushed forward by the radiation pressure force and induce a charge separation in the plasma , generating a strong electrostatic field , which accelerates ions . as a result",
    "a shock wave like structure is formed in the plasma @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the shock wave front in the piston reference frame coincides with the piston velocity in the laboratory frame and is equal @xcite to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the laser pulse intensity , @xmath13 the ion mass , and @xmath14 the ion density .",
    "if the plasma target is thin , then radiation pressure can completely separate charges and further accelerate ions , because they are not anymore screened by the background plasma @xcite .",
    "this regime is described by the light sail ( ls ) model @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of the target reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the component of the 4-velocity along the direction of the laser pulse propagation , and @xmath17 is the thickness of the target .",
    "the optimal for acceleration thickness of the target can be estimated as @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the laser wavelength and @xmath20 is the initial electron density , @xmath21 is the critical density , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are electron mass and charge , and @xmath24 is the laser frequency @xmath25 .",
    "in the laser piston case accelerated ions move along the laser pulse direction at the velocity @xcite @xmath26 .",
    "suppose , that a laser pulse propagates along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "then the non - vanishing spatial component of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass density of accelerated ions in their proper reference frame , which is equal to the mass density of undisturbed plasma in the lab frame , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the x - component of the ion four - velocity ( the other components @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 are the gamma - factors .",
    "if we assume for simplicity , that the profile of accelerated plasma is a square of side @xmath34 , then @xmath35 for the laser piston takes the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the heaviside step function and @xmath38 is the piston acceleration time in the lab frame .",
    "it is related to the duration of the laser pulse @xmath39 via @xmath40 because in the piston frame laser pulse duration is equal to @xmath41 due to the doppler effect , and after the transition to the lab frame we obtain ( [ taup ] ) .",
    "the fourier transform of the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath42 .",

    "the only non ",

    "[ fig_1 ] ( a ) .",
    "one can see , that the gravitational wave reaches the detector at time @xmath62 , when the disturbance from the upper side of the ion target comes to the observation point .",

    "@xmath65 reaches its maximum value @xmath66 at the moment @xmath67 , and hence the amplitude of gw in the piston case is equal to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the total kinetic energy of accelerated ions and we substituted the definitions of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and assumed that @xmath73 .",
    "this condition implies that the acceleration time is much longer then the laser period .    according to ( [ vf ] ) the shock wave velocity @xmath74 and hence the velocity of accelerated ions @xmath75 increase when @xmath76 decreases .",
    "therefore to maximize the metrics distortion ( [ hmaxp ] ) we choose the lowest possible ion density .",
    "it is defined by the fact that to make efficient piston acceleration , a nontransparent piston is needed . in the relativistic laser plasma interaction , this transfers into the requirement that the electron density @xmath20 in the piston is higher that the critical density @xmath77 multiplied by the gamma factor of electrons , which is approximately equal to @xmath78 , i.e. for the optimal density we get @xmath79 and hence @xmath80    if the distance to the detector is @xmath81 m , laser frequency @xmath82 hz , laser intensity @xmath83 w/@xmath84 , laser pulse duration @xmath85 fs , @xmath86  proton mass , @xmath87 @xmath88 m , then the ions total kinetic energy can be estimated as @xmath89 kj , ions optimal density @xmath90 g/@xmath91 and maximal metrics distortion @xmath92 .      in the case of the ls - model @xcite the solution of the equation of ions motion ( [ eqls ] ) reads @xmath93 here @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the @xmath27 component of the four velocity of ions at the beginning of the ls acceleration regime and @xmath96 where we took into account estimation ( [ l ] ) for target thickness .",
    "if we assume , that @xmath97 , ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , then the solution ( [ usol ] ) can be simplified to @xmath100 because @xmath101 can be approximated as @xmath102 and the relativistic @xmath103 factor can be estimated as @xmath104 .",

    "( [ l ] ) , does not change during the acceleration .",
    "the dependence of energy - momentum tensor of accelerated ions ( [ emt ] ) on coordinates and time then reads @xmath112 after fourier transform we get @xmath113 .",

    "note , that according to ( [ l ] ) @xmath122 , and then gw amplitude in the ls model does not depend on ion density .",

    "the scaling of @xmath126 with laser intensity for both models is plotted in the figure [ fig : spec ] ( a ) .",
    "in all the intensity range considered here , piston model gives higher metric distortion than the light sail model .",
    "the same values of @xmath126 are reached only at intensities of the order @xmath127 w/@xmath128 but in this range quantum electrodynamic effects must be considered as they may change the interaction significantly . in both models , the scaling with laser intensity is weaker than linear , which means that higher metric distortions can be in principle obtained using larger laser spot size and smaller laser intensity ( with the same laser pulse energy ) .",
    "nevertheless the minimum laser intensity is related to the validity of the piston and the light sail model ( radiation pressure acceleration of ions must be dominant ) and thus the metric distortion can not be increased significantly .",

    "the maximum of the spectrum is located in the region @xmath144 because the perturbation is not periodic and has a finite duration .",
    "we observe , that the spectrum shifts to the lower frequencies with the growth of laser pulse intensity because of relativistic increasing of acceleration time , see eqs .",

    "note , that for pulse parameters under consideration and target size of the order of microns @xmath145 if the frequency @xmath24 is located in the part of spectrum , where gw emission is significant , see figure [ fig : spec ] ( b ) . therefore sine and bessel functions in the equations ( [ emftp ] ) , ( [ eq : txxsail ] ) , ( [ tcircp ] ) and ( [ tcircls ] ) can be expanded into taylor series up to the first term , and fourier transforms for energy - momentum tensor for circular and square targets become the same .",

    "the generation of high - frequency gravitational waves by high - power laser systems was considered and their functional dependence on the laser - plasma interaction parameters was derived .    in the piston regime",
    "the source of gw is the shock wave in a thick plasma target , continuously increasing the mass of accelerated matter . in the light sail regime",
    "the mass of accelerated matter remains constant , but the velocity is increasing .",
    "the spectrum of gw has a typical pulse - like form with the maximum at @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the duration of gw . for realistic laser and plasma parameters",
    "the gw frequency is of the order of tens of thz .",
    "the direction of gw propagation depends on the velocity of ions .",
    "non - relativistic ions emit gw transversely to the direction of acceleration , and the direction of gw propagation turns to the direction of acceleration with the increasing of ion velocity .    in both cases investigated , the perturbations of the space - time metric are small and detection is a challenge .",
    "high - frequency gw detectors were suggested @xcite , which are based on the coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic wave in the presence of background magnetic field ( inverse gertsenshtein effect @xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity for such detector was estimated to be of the order of @xmath153  hz@xmath154 , see @xcite . for gw under consideration in the present paper @xmath155  hz@xmath154 .",
    "it should be noted , that the gw amplitude could not be sufficiently increased by increasing of the laser intensity , because instead of acceleration the laser energy would be wasted on strong field qed processes such as qed cascades @xcite , which start at @xmath156 w/@xmath84 or electron - positron pair creation from vacuum @xcite , which starts at @xmath157 w/@xmath84 and in principle is able to totally exhaust the laser pulse @xcite",
    ". the focus spot radius of high intensity lasers is of the order of wavelength , and it additionally restricts gw amplitude , due to limiting the number of accelerated ions .",
    "however increasing of the laser pulse energy ( i.e. the size of the focus spot and the pulse duration ) is a way to increase the energy of accelerated ions and hence gw amplitude ."
