    "a recent proposal @xcite for quantum computation utilizes the ground hyperfine states of a neutral atom as qubits , and realizes two - qubit quantum gates by conditional excitations to rydberg states .",
    "the atoms are confined to the sites of an optical lattice , and the optical potential seen by the atom depends on the dynamic polarizability of the atom .",
    "therefore , the atom will generally move in a different lattice potential when it is excited to the rydberg state during the gate operation , which may cause motional heating and lead to decoherence . in a recent paper @xcite , we proposed two solutions to this problem by matching the ac polarizabilities of the atom in the ground and rydberg states . in the first scheme ,",
    "the polarizabilities are matched for the specific values of the lattice photon frequency between the resonances . in the second scheme , some accidental matches between transition energies are used to match the ground state polarizability with the polarizability of the selected rydberg states ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the case of rb ) .",
    "the elimination of motional decoherence is important in helping to design a high - fidelity two - qubit gate capable of meeting the error threshold for scalable quantum computation .    despite the existence of high - precision measurements of the primary transition electric - dipole matrix elements in alkali - metal atoms , accurate experimental data for other transitions",
    "are lacking with the exception of a very few transitions in cs owing to the study of parity nonconservation . in light of the importance of the atomic calculations for the quantum logic gate scheme with conditional excitations to rydberg levels , we have calculated the electric - dipole matrix elements for subsequent evaluation of lifetimes and polarizabilities for a number of rb levels .",
    "we note that the interest in this particular logic gate scheme with neutral atoms results from its potential for fast ( sub - microsecond ) gate operations .",
    "we have performed all - order calculations of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 electric - dipole matrix elements with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and of the @xmath2 matrix elements .",
    "these results are combined with previous all - order calculations of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 matrix elements @xcite to obtain values of the lifetimes of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 levels .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath28 level is of special interest owing to the large discrepancies between existing experiments @xcite .",
    "the third - order matrix - element calculation has also been carried out to evaluate the importance of the higher - order contributions .",
    "the dynamic polarizabilities of the rb @xmath3 states are also calculated for both low - lying and rydberg levels .",
    "the evaluation of the accuracy of the polarizability calculations is conducted including a comparison between our data and other theory and experiment .",
    "the electric - dipole matrix elements for the @xmath29 transitions were measured to high accuracy in @xcite and matrix elements for @xmath0 transitions with @xmath30 and @xmath31 were calculated using a single - double ( sd ) all - order method in refs .",

    "as expected , the polarizabilities depend weakly on @xmath42 for the frequencies considered here .",
    "the polarizabilities of the ground and rydberg states can be matched at the point between two resonances where the ground state polarizability is small and negative .",
