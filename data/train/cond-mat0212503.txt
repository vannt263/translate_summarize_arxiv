    "although superconductivity in mgb@xmath12 @xcite has been established as conventional phonon - mediated s - wave superconductivity , it is often difficult to analyze the results of measurements of various physical quantities because there exist two gaps of different magnitude associated with different bands .",
    "their ratio is estimated as @xmath13 where the larger gap @xmath14 is associated with the two - dimensional @xmath15-bands and the smaller gap @xmath16 with the three - dimensional @xmath17-bands .",
    "evidence for two gaps is provided by the rapid rise of the specific heat coefficient @xmath0 at very low fields.@xcite recent measurements of the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath18 for fields both parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis provide more evidence for the existence of two gaps because they show a very unusual field dependence at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite for increasing field , @xmath18 drops rapidly and reaches a minimum at a relatively low field , then exhibits an s - shape behavior where a steep rise in the low - field region is followed by a downward curvature up to about @xmath19 and finally an upward curvature near @xmath9 for @xmath20 .",
    "the initial drop is attributed to the decrease of the phononic contribution @xmath21 which is caused by the rapid enhancement of scattering of phonons by the quasiparticles in the vortex cores associated with the @xmath17-band .",
    "the steep increase in the low field region is attributed to the rapid rise of the electronic contribution @xmath22 which arises from the the rapid release of mobile quasiparticles in the vortex lattice asociated with the @xmath17-band .",
    "the final upward curvature of @xmath23 near @xmath9 for @xmath20 is presumed to be due to the mobile carriers of the vortex lattice associated with the @xmath15-band .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be explained qualitatively in terms of a two - band model with two energy gaps of different magnitude in the two bands where the band with strong pairing ( the l , or @xmath15-band ) is responsible for the superconductivity and the superconductivity in the second band ( the s , or @xmath17-band ) is induced by cooper pair tunneling .",
    "@xcite the vortices in the s - band have large vortex cores of radius @xmath24 and already start to overlap in weak fields .",
    "this leads to a strong suppression of the small gap at a `` virtual '' upper critical field @xmath25 koe which is much smaller than @xmath26 koe .",
    "the large radius of the vortex core and the field - induced suppression of the smaller gap is consistent with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements .",
    "@xcite    theories of the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath27 @xcite and the phononic thermal conductivity @xmath10 @xcite in the mixed state have been developed on the basis of the brandt - pesch - tewordt ( bpt ) @xcite and the equivalent pesch ( p ) @xcite approximation schemes .",
    "linear response equations for the vortex state @xcite yield another expression for @xmath27 which has been applied to d - wave pairing superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "@xcite in the bpt - approximation the normal and anomalous green s functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are derived from gorkov s integral equations with kernel @xmath30 where @xmath31 is abrikosov s vortex lattice order parameter and @xmath32 is the quasihole propagator .",
    "thus these green s functions take into account the effects of supercurrent flow and andreev scattering in the vortex cores as well as quasiparticle transfer between the vortices . the expression for @xmath27 @xcite , which has been derived from the kubo formula in analogy to the procedure in ref .",
    ", consists essentially of the @xmath33-integral with the factor @xmath34 determining the temperature dependence , the `` destructive '' coherence factor arising from the combination @xmath35 , and the total scattering rate in the denominator consisting of the sum of the quasiparticle scattering rates @xmath36 and @xmath37 due to impurity and andreev scattering . in the present paper",
    "we shall also calculate the scattering rate @xmath38 due to thermal scattering in the vortex state , but this becomes comparable to @xmath36 only at higher temperatures .",
    "the expression for @xmath10 contains , in addition to the sum of scattering rates of phonons by different defects , the scattering rate @xmath39 for phonons scattered by quasiparticles in the vortex state .",
    "the latter expression was obtained by replacing in the bcs - expression @xcite the density of states ( dos ) and `` coherence '' functions by the expressions resulting from the p - approximation for the vortex state .",
    "@xcite    the results for @xmath40 , @xmath4 , and @xmath41 , which were obtained in ref .",
    "for a single cylindrical or spherical band and an isotropic s - wave pairing gap , turned out to depend sensitively on the reduced impurity scattering rate @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the zero - field coherence length and @xmath44 is the mean free path . if one takes for the @xmath17-band in mgb@xmath11 @xmath45 from the sts measurements @xcite and a mean free path @xmath46 , one arrives at a reduced sacttering rate @xmath47 which is much larger than the largest value of @xmath48 taken in ref .  .",
    "for such a large impurity scattering rate it is necessary to renormalize the impurity scattering self energy and to take into account the corresponding vertex corrections .",
    "the vertex corrections yield a renormalization of the gap function @xcite which , near @xmath49 , tends to the renormalization function which has been derived in the calculation of @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite it turns out that this gap renormalization substantially reduces the dependence of the functions @xmath40 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 on impurity scattering .",
    "recently it has been shown that numerical solutions of the eilenberger equations yield a spatial average of the density of states ( dos ) which is approximated very well by the dos obtained with the bpt- and p - approximations over the whole field range between @xmath9 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite this result motivates us to calculate the field dependence of the central parameter of the theory , @xmath51 , from the gap equation in the p - approximation @xcite by including the impurity scattering vertex corrections in analogy to those in the gap equation of the bpt - approximation .",
    "@xcite here @xmath52 is the spatial average of @xmath53 where @xmath31 is abrikosov s vortex lattice order parameter , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the lattice constant of the vortex lattice , and @xmath56 is the fermi velocity perpendicular to the uniform field * h*. it turns out that one can fit the exact results of these calculations very well with the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 given by the ginzburg - landau relationship if one uses an appropriate value of the abrikosov parameter @xmath59 .",
    "we have also investigated the temperature dependence of the phonon relaxation time ratio @xmath7 and find that this ratio increases rapidly to one with increasing @xmath8 in proportion to @xmath60 ^ 2 $ ] for temperatures @xmath61 .",
    "this yields a rapid decrease of @xmath10 for small fields and relatively low temperatures if one takes for @xmath62 the small gap @xmath63 of the @xmath17-band .",
    "in this way one can explain the observed drop of @xmath64 for small fields and temperatures near @xmath65 which is attributed to the drop of @xmath66 . @xcite    since the interband impurity scattering between the @xmath15- and @xmath17-band is small , @xcite one can add , in a crude approximation , our results obtained for a single isotropic gap in a cylindrical or spherical fermi surface ( fs ) band by weighting them with the corresponding density of states .",
    "if one takes into account that the `` virtual '' upper critical field for the three - dimensional @xmath17-band is much smaller than the upper critical field of the two - dimensional @xmath15-band,@xcite one can explain qualitatively the measured field dependence of the specific heat and thermal conductivity in mgb@xmath11 .",
    "the basis of our theory is the approximation of brandt , pesch , and tewordt ( bpt ) @xcite for the normal and anomalous green s functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the mixed state .",

    "we have calculated the density of states @xmath240 , the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath133 , and the scattering rates @xmath241 of a phonon and @xmath242 of a quasiparticle for a single isotropic gap over the entire field range of the mixed state . that the bpt @xcite and p @xcite methods for these calculations are valid approximation schemes has been proved by comparison of the results for @xmath70 with the solutions of the eilenberger equations for abrikosov s vortex lattice order parameter .",
    "@xcite by solving the gap equation including impurity self energy and vertex corrections ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we have shown that the relation between the central parameter of the theory , @xmath243 , and @xmath58 can be very well approximated by the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) relation [ see eq.(5 ) ] over the entire field range if one uses an appropriate value of the abrikosov parameter @xmath244 .",
    "this result is connected with the fact that the abrikosov order parameter is a solution of the linearized gl equations which allows extension of the bpt method over the entire region of linear magnetization .",
    "@xcite    the second main result of the present paper is that the vertex corrections due to impurity scattering @xcite substantially reduce the dependence of the functions @xmath40 , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 on the amount of impurity scattering .",
    "the impurity scattering rate @xmath245 is renormalized here in the born approximation @xmath246 where @xmath247 is calculated self - consistently from eq.([a ] ) .",
    "the vertex corrections yield a renormalization of the gap @xmath248 due to the function @xmath92 [ see eq.([d ] ) ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , the functions @xmath2 for @xmath2490.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 are not very different from each other .",
    "the results are however quite different if we set the renormalization function @xmath92 equal to one .",
    "then the slope of @xmath2 versus @xmath58 at @xmath128 rises rapidly with @xmath118 and becomes very large for @xmath250 .",
    "it should be noticed that all curves in fig .",
    "2 tend to zero in the zero field limit as they should to be in accordance with anderson s theorem for `` dirty '' superconductors .",
    "our result that the effect of impurity scattering on the field dependence of @xmath2 for a single isotropic gap is rather small and does not yield a rapid rise for small fields , gives support for the two - gap model in interpreting the measurements of @xmath2 on single crystals of mgb@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite according to this model , the first steep increase of @xmath40 , which is nearly the same for applied fields parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis , arises from the behavoir of the small gap associated with the three dimensional @xmath17-band .",
    "this in effect closes for increasing field due to the overlap of the vortex cores with large radius @xmath251 @xcite at a relatively small `` virtual '' upper critical field @xmath252 3 - 4 koe .",
    "the remaining superconducting contribution above @xmath253 arises from the large gap associated with the two dimensional @xmath15-band which closes at an upper critical field @xmath254 32 koe and @xmath255 160 koe .",
    "the field dependence of the @xmath17-band and the @xmath15-band contributions to @xmath2 is presumably given by the almost linear curves in fig . 2 for @xmath256 and @xmath257 with @xmath9 equal to @xmath258 and @xmath259 or @xmath260 , respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath261 shown in fig .",
    "3 depend on the impurity scattering rate @xmath118 primarily because the effect of andreev scattering on the upward curvature becomes relatively smaller as @xmath118 increases .",
    "although the slope at @xmath128 is relatively small even for @xmath262 , it becomes very large at @xmath263 if the renormalization of the gap @xmath264 due to the vertex correction @xmath92 in @xmath27 [ see eq.([beta ] ) ] is neglected .",
    "this new result has the consequence that the observed steep rise of @xmath22 for small fields parallel or perpendicular to the c - axis in single - crystalline mgb@xmath11 @xcite can again be explained only in terms of the two - gap model where the smaller gap in the three dimensional @xmath17-band closes in effect at a `` virtual '' upper critical field @xmath2653 - 4 koe due to the overlap of the vortex cores with large radius @xmath266 .",
    "@xcite at higher fields @xmath22 tends to saturate until , in the vicinity of @xmath26732 koe , the contribution to @xmath27 from the larger gap associated with the cylindrical @xmath15-band exhibits an upward curvature .",
    "the contributions to @xmath27 arising from the @xmath17- and @xmath15-bands are presumably given by the curves in fig .",
    "3 for @xmath268 and @xmath257 with the corresponding @xmath9 equal to @xmath253 and @xmath259 where the curve for @xmath257 yields the measured upward curvature near @xmath49 .",
    "the rapid decrease of @xmath64 observed at low fields , which is attributed to the decrease of the phononic thermal conductivity @xmath66 , @xcite can be explained by the field and relevant temperature dependence of the ratio of phonon lifetimes @xmath269 shown in fig .",
    "one sees that @xmath270 tends rapidly to the constant one for increasing field and values of @xmath271 corresponding to temperatures @xmath272 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath62 is the smaller gap associated with the @xmath17-band , then the @xmath182 satisfying this condition are much smaller than @xmath273 .",
    "however , at the lowest temperatures , this effect on @xmath10 is strongly reduced because the scattering rate @xmath39 occuring in the denominator of the @xmath33-integral for @xmath10 is multiplied by @xmath274 in comparison to the scattering rate due to sample boundary scattering ( see eq.(4 ) of ref .  ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath22 in the limit @xmath174 , or @xmath275 . for finite",
    "@xmath182 one has to solve the transcendental equation determining the pole @xmath231 of the bpt - green s function @xcite for each finite value of @xmath33 occuring in the @xmath33-integral for @xmath133 .",
    "it should be pointed out that this calculation is avoided in the expression for @xmath27 which was derived from linear response theory .",
    "@xcite for higher temperatures one should add to the sum of scattering rates @xmath36 and @xmath138 due to impurity and andreev scattering [ see eq.([beta ] ) ] , the scattering rate @xmath6 due to scattering of quasiparticles by phonons .",
    "the field and relevant temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath276 is shown in fig .",
    "5 as a function of @xmath172 .",
    "one sees that this ratio is nearly equal to one for values of @xmath277 corresponding to temperatures @xmath278 . for the small gap associated with the @xmath17-band",
    "this condition is probably satisfied at those temperatures where @xmath279 becomes comparable to the intraband impurity scattering @xmath36 for the @xmath17-band .",
    "however , for the large gap associated with the @xmath15-band , this condition might not be satisfied .",
    "we conclude from these estimates that , for the @xmath17-band , @xmath38 can be approximated by @xmath221 while , for the @xmath15-band , the field dependence of @xmath6 should be taken into account .",
    "these considerations are supported by detailed calculations which yield a larger intraband impurity scattering rate @xmath36 for the @xmath17-band than for the @xmath15-band , @xcite and a larger scattering rate @xmath221 for the @xmath15-band than for the @xmath17-band because the intraband electron - phonon coupling constant satisfies @xmath280 .",
    "@xcite    our assumption that we can simply add our results obtained for two different isotropic gaps and different upper critical fields in the @xmath17- and @xmath15-bands is a crude approximation in view of the actual situation in mgb@xmath11 .",
    "it is true that the interaction due to interband impurity scattering between the @xmath15- and @xmath17-bands is small .",
    "@xcite however , we have neglected the pairing interaction between the two bands which presumably leads to cooper pair tunneling from the @xmath15-band with strong pairing to the @xmath17-band where it leads to giant vortex cores and where superconductivity is maintained above the virtual @xmath253 up to @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite nevertheless we believe that our clear - cut results for the mixed state of a single isotropic gap are helpful in analyzing the complicated behavior of different physical quantities in mgb@xmath11 .",
    "another approximation is that we have neglected higher harmonic oscillator components n of abrivosov s vortex lattice order parameter which lead to a distortion of the lattice at lower fields .",
    "@xcite for an s - wave superconductor the bpt method breaks down at low fields where properties are determined by the states bound to the vortex cores .",
