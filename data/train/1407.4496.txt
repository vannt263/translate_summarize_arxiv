    "this transform appears in several imaging modalities , such as thermo / photoacoustic tomography @xcite , ultrasound imaging @xcite , sonar @xcite , sar @xcite and inverse elasticity @xcite .    in many applications",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath8 is compactly supported inside the half space @xmath15 then , @xmath8 can be reconstructed from @xmath16 by the filtered back projection formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the formal @xmath19-adjoint of @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the pseudo - differential operator of order @xmath23 defined by @xmath24    however , in real applications , the knowledge of @xmath7 is only available on a closed bounded subset @xmath25 with nontrivial interior ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the following formula is proposed for the approximate construction in several works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath26 here , @xmath27",
    "it has been commonly assumed that @xmath28 .",
    "we prove in @xcite that , under this assumption , @xmath29 is a pseudo - differential operator with the principal symbol @xmath30 where @xmath12 is the intersection of the line @xmath31 through @xmath32 along direction of @xmath33 with the plane @xmath34 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath35 is infinitely smooth is essential to apply the theory of pseudo - differential operator to analyze @xmath29 . in particular",
    ", it implies @xmath36 . the multiplication with such function @xmath35 is considered as an infinite smoothening .",
    "however , it is known to eliminate some singularities ( image features ) pointing near the boundary of @xmath37 ( see more discussion in @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "therefore , one might consider to use other kind of smoothening ( e.g. , of finite order is smoothening of order @xmath3 if @xmath38 across @xmath39 . ] ) or no smoothening at all . on @xmath37 .",
    "] however , these choices are shown to generate the artifacts into the pictures ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order for the practitioners to make the correct choice",
    ", it is important to analyze the effect of @xmath29 under these situations .",
    "the recent work by j. frikel and t. quinto @xcite provides a nice geometric description for what happens .",
    "in particular , they show that the visible singularities are reconstructed and the artifacts would occur in some specific pattern ( see more discussion below ) .",
    "our main goal is to characterize the strength of the reconstructed singularities and , more importantly , the artifacts .",
    "it is worth mentioning that similar problem has been studied for the x - ray ( or classical radon ) transform @xcite .",
    "although this article shares the same spirit with our previous work @xcite , the technique developed here is original and different from there .",
    "namely , in this article , for each type of singularities , we have to make a correct choice of the oscillatory representation of @xmath29 to work with . moreover , the microlocal analytic arguments employed here are more sophisticated than there .",
    "a different but related topic is to analyze the imaging scenarios when the associated canonical relation is not a local graph ( see , e.g. , @xcite , just to name a few ) .",
    "the pioneering work by greenleaf and uhlmann @xcite employs the theory of class @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) to analyze such a situation appearing in the x - ray transform .",
    "the same technique has been exploited successfully in other situations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although a direct use of such an idea does not seem to work in our situation , our approach is inspired by the same spirit .",
    "namely , we analyze the microlocal behavior of the associated fio ( or more precisely its schwartz kernel ) on its intersecting lagrangians .    for the case @xmath41 , using the argument as in @xcite , we show that the artifacts are generated by rotating the boundary singularities . ] along circles whose center is an end point of @xmath37 ( see proposition [ p : wavefront ] and discussion  1 ) .",
    "moreover , employing some asymptotic arguments , we analyze the strength of these artifacts .",
    "namely , assume that @xmath35 vanishes to order @xmath3 at the end points of @xmath37",
    ". is smoothening of order @xmath42 we prove that the artifacts are @xmath3 orders smoother than the original singularities ( see theorem [ t : main1 ] and discussion  2 ) .",
    "we go further to analyze the problem in three dimensional space .",
    "we consider @xmath37 to be the rectangle @xmath43 \\times [ -b , b]$ ] and @xmath44 vanishes on the edges of @xmath37 to order @xmath3 .",
    "we , using the arguments as in @xcite , show that the singularities propagate by rotating around either a vertex or an edge of @xmath37 ( see proposition [ p : wavefront-3 ] and discussion  3 ) .",
    "moreover , employing delicate asymptotic and microlocal analytic arguments , we prove that the artifacts generated by a rotation around a vertex are @xmath4 orders smoother than the original singularity , while those from a rotation around an edge are @xmath3 orders smoother than the original singularity ( see theorem [ t : main2 ] and discussion  4 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that , for both two and three dimensional problems , all the visible singularities and [ s:3dim ] . ]",
    "are reconstructed with the correct order .",
    "this follows from a similar argument for full data problem in @xcite ( see theorems [ t : main1 ]  a ) and [ t : main2 ]  a ) ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ s:2dim ]",

    "the three dimensional problem is studied in section [ s:3dim ] .",
    "some concluding remarks are provided in section  [ s : re ] .",
