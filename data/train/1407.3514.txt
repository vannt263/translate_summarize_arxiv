    "the width is approximately 3 nm and we vary the length between 3 and 13 nm .",
    "the temperature is controlled with a nose - hoover thermostat , with a time constant of 1 ps . depending on the proximity to the melting temperature , simulations were run between 10 and 1000 ns in order to obtain converged estimates of the surface properties .",
    "the long timescales are required because the size of fluctuations in the interface become as large as the system as @xmath0 is approached .",
    "use of the mw model allows us to easily access these timescales .",

    ". however , any simple definition of the decay of the order parameter profile yields a measure of the premelting thickness that is not single valued because of the oscillations in the density and order density . in the next section we show how coarse - graining out these short - wavelength oscillations yields a smooth profile with a well - defined premelting length and produces an effective mapping from this atomistic representation to a scalar field , which can be analyzed simply within a mean field theory .",

    "[ equpd : profiles ] , and make contact with the long - wavelength description supplied by the field theory used later , we must integrate out lengthscales small compared to typical intermolecular distances . a way to do this in a computer simulation",

    "we define this boundary as being where the field is locally equal to @xmath48 of its average bulk value .",
    "this procedure for constructing an instantaneous interface is similar to previous calculations used for calculating liquid - vapor interfacial properties.@xcite    the crystal - liquid surface tension determines the mean squared fluctuations in the height of the interface.@xcite the fact that the liquid - crystal surface tension is about half of the liquid - vapor surface tension@xcite means that while there is a significant free energetic penalty to forming an interface , the size of fluctuations that result at such an interface are large in amplitude .",
    "these fluctuations are larger than what are seen at  soft \" liquid - vapor interfaces .",
    "the dispersion relation for the size of fluctuations over large lengthscales is the same as that found for capillary waves , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the amplitude of the fourier transform of the height - height correlation function , @xmath51 is boltzmann s constant times temperature and @xmath52 is the surface tension .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure used , which evaluates @xmath38 on a grid with resolution of 1 @xmath53 , recovers this scaling relation for wave vectors smaller than 0.6 @xmath54 , as shown in fig .",

    "this fact is important for the field theory model we adopt in the next section .",
    "the insensitivity near the melting temperature to crystal orientation is examined further in subsequent sections .",
    "the insensitivity suggests that the roughening temperatures of ice are lower than the temperatures we consider.@xcite    at the melting temperature , the size of height fluctuations grows due to the interface becoming delocalized .",
    "this can be appreciated by the blue lines in fig .",

    "in order to understand the temperature dependence of the premelting layer , and to test quantitative predictions for experiment , we turn to statistical field theory .",

    "recent work on the evaporation from the surface of liquid water that has concluded that this process is similarly barrierless.@xcite it would seem that the existence of a disordered interface at the boundary between the condensed phase and the vapor supplies sufficiently facile reorganization around an evaporating molecule that evaporation from either a liquid or a quasi - liquid layer is simply a ballistic process . only for low temperature , where the premelting layer vanishes , @xmath105  k , is evaporation expected to have to overcome a barrier .    in this work ,",

    "<S> , this driving force can be easily rationalized from a microscopic perspective . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fi:1 ] shows representative configurations of the surface of ice at conditions far away from , and close to , the melting temperature . to capture these configurations , </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out molecular simulations of the tip4p/2005 model of water .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at very cold conditions , i.e , temperature @xmath5 much below the melting temperature @xmath0 , the surface is ordered and molecules at the surface are forced to break one hydrogen bond on average . at higher temperatures , @xmath6 , hydrogen bonding is still disrupted but this energetic loss is balanced by an entropic gain in restoring translational invariance parallel to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the concomitant enhancement of fluctuations at the interface increases in scale as the melting temperature is approached . </S>",
    "<S> exactly at @xmath0 , the degeneracy in the free energy dictates that for an infinite system the thickness of the interface may diverge as it is equally likely that the bulk is liquid or crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> how the thickness of the premelting layer changes with temperature reflects the interplay between bulk free energies that favor order and the boundary condition that excludes it . as reviewed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , experimental estimates of the thickness of the premelting layer at a prescribed temperature , typically @xmath7k , vary by over two orders of magnitude depending on the technique and interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> partially , this variability occurs because different techniques probe different physical properties with differing correlations to structural disorder . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray and proton scattering are typically more sensitive to long ranged order , and other surface selective techniques , such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy@xcite and atomic force microscopy,@xcite have also been used with success . in all cases , however , the strong temperature dependence of the thickness adds to uncertainties due to contamination and surface preparation . </S>",
    "<S> further , in all cases it is not straightforward to connect the observations to molecular level details .    </S>",
    "<S> theory and simulation offer a way to remove this ambiguity . specifically , using sufficiently general statistical mechanical arguments , which relate experimental observables to emergent behavior with assumptions tested with explicit molecular simulations , the phenomenology of the premelting layer can be understood and quantified . in what follows , we will show that a simple extension of the field theory we have used previously@xcite accurately predicts the existence and scaling of the premelting layer as a function of both temperature and system size . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of our field theory is confirmed with efficient molecular dynamics simulations of the mw model .  </S>"
