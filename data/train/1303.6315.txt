    "swarming and flocking arise as emergent phenomena of collective motion behavior in a large variety of living and non - living self - propelled particle systems of great interdisciplinary interest .",
    "nature offers a huge variety of collective motion phenomena in self - propelled living systems at all scales , from biomolecular micromotors , migrating cells and growing bacteria colonies , to insect swarms , fish schools , bird flocks , mammal herds and even human crowds  @xcite .",
    "moreover , many non - living systems of great practical interest involve collective motion and swarming behavior , particularly in robotics , where swarms of robots are used in terrain exploration , plague control , optimization of telecommunication networks , surveillance and defense , and other tasks without centralized control that appear too challenging to be carried out by an individual agent  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the novel concept of chemical robots ( also known as _ chobots _ ) has been envisioned as an army of millions of micrometer - sized robots whose tasks will be to release a chemical payload , or to mix two chemical reactants from different compartments within the chobots when they reach their goal  @xcite .    instead of focusing on the specific details that make each of these self - propelled systems unique , statistical physicists have been studying the general patterns of collective motion , aiming to identify the general laws and underlying principles that may govern their behavior . from this perspective , one important question to address is the onset of ordered macroscopic phases , i.e. the way in which individuals having short - range interactions are capable of self - organizing into large - scale cooperative patterns in the absence of leaders or other ordering cues from the environment . by analogy with large molecular systems , flocking and swarming phenomena can be associated with phase transitions that depend on a few parameters that characterize the macroscopic states , such as the density of individuals and the flock size .",
    "for instance , buhl et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the collective motion of locusts , which display a density - driven transition from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion .",
    "similar transitions have been observed in the colective motion of zooplankton swarms  @xcite , fish schools  @xcite , and many other self - propelled particle systems ( @xcite and references therein ) .    on the theoretical side , vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a minimal model to study the onset of order in systems of self - driven individuals , which was later followed by other investigations by means of agent - based modeling  @xcite , the newtonian force - equation approach  @xcite , and the hydrodynamic approximation  @xcite .",
    "the so - called standard vicsek model ( svm )  @xcite assumes that neighboring individuals tend to align their direction of movement when they are placed within a certain interaction range .",
    "this alignment rule , which would trivially lead to fully ordered collective motion , is complemented by a second one that introduces noise in the communications among individuals . in their seminal paper ,",
    "vicsek et al .",
    "show that the noise amplitude drives the system through a continuous , second - order transition between an ordered phase of collective motion and a disordered phase .    in this context ,",
    "the aim of this work is to explore an extension of the svm , in which an additional parameter @xmath0 is introduced to control the gregarious vs individualistic behavior of particle motion .",
    "that is , an individual has a probability @xmath0 to adopt its own direction of motion regardless of its neighbors , and a probability @xmath4 to move according to the svm s rules . this @xmath2extended model may account for  free will \" behavior in biological systems ( i.e. the fact that living organisms are not ruled by fixed decision algorithms and are therefore able to make unforeseen individualistic decisions at any time ) as well as for random failures in robotic and other artificial self - propelled particle systems ( e.g. the chemically - driven _ chobots _ mentioned above ) . by focusing on the small - noise regime ,",
    "we show that a relatively small probability of individualistic motion ( around @xmath1 ) is sufficient to drive the system from a vicsek - like ordered phase to a disordered phase .",
    "besides the practical interest of extending the well - studied svm to novel scenarios of particle behavior , we find a theoretically intriguing manifestation of the richness of the swarming phenomenon , namely that the @xmath2driven phase transition is discontinuous ( first - order ) , despite the fact that the @xmath2extended model preserves the @xmath3 symmetry , the interaction range , as well as the dimensionality of the underlying svm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the definition of the svm and the @xmath2extended model .",
    "section 3 presents a discussion of our results , while our conclusions finally appear in section 4 .",
    "the svm  @xcite consists of a fixed number of interacting particles , @xmath5 , which are moving on a plane . in computer simulations , that plane is typically represented by a square of side @xmath6 with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the particles move off - lattice with constant and common speed @xmath7 .",
    "each particle interacts locally adopting the direction of motion of the subsystem of neighboring particles ( within an interaction circle of radius @xmath8 centered in the considered particle ) , which is perturbed by the presence of noise . since the interaction radius is the same for all particles , we adopt the interaction radius as the unit of length throughout , i.e. @xmath9 . the model is implemented as a cellular automaton , i.e. all particles update their states simultaneously in one time step .",
    "the updated direction of motion for the @xmath10th particle , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12+\\eta\\xi_i^t\\ , \\label{anterm}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the noise amplitude , the summation is carried over all particles within the interaction circle centered at the @xmath10th particle , and @xmath14 is a realization of a @xmath15-correlated white noise uniformly distributed in the range between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    in this work ,",
    "we implement the model dynamics by adopting the so - called forward update ( fu ) rule , in which the updated velocities at time @xmath18 determine the new positions according to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unitary time step of the cellular automaton .",
    "this scheme is used for computational convenience , since the transient length is shorter than using the backward update rule that determines the new velocities _",
    "after _ the positions are updated . in the context of vicsek model studies ,",
    "the fu rule was first introduced by chat et al .  @xcite . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fu scheme requires to implement an algorithm that ensures the @xmath3 rotational invariance of the svm , since spurious effects induced by the boundary conditions of the simulation space may arise otherwise . at every time step , a frame rotation angle , @xmath21 ,",
    "is randomly selected with uniform probability in the @xmath22 range . after all particle velocities are accordingly transformed ,",
    "the usual vicsek model rules are applied .",
    "the effects of boundary conditions on the displacement space , as well as alternative methods to ensure the @xmath3 rotational invariance , are further discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to study the relative effects of gregarious vs individualistic behavior , we consider an extension of the svm model in which a parameter @xmath23 is introduced as follows .",
    "when considering the new velocity of a given particle , we first determine whether that particle will behave individualistically or gregariously : with probability @xmath0 , the particle will choose a new direction of motion at random ( and independently of its neighbors ) , and with probability @xmath4 , the particle s new velocity will follow the standard vicsek s rule , eq.([anterm ] ) . in the former case , the new direction of motion is randomly chosen with uniform probability in the range between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in passing ,",
    "let us point out that , in a different context , mixtures of spins coupled to independent heat baths have been studied for the kinetic ising model and far - from - equilibrium spin chains  @xcite . by analogy",
    ", we can consider our model as dealing with off - lattice ferromagnetic  spins \" that undergo displacements along the direction of the spin . at",
    "any given time , gregarious individuals could be thought of as  cold spins \" , while individualistic individuals could be analogously regarded as  hot spins \" coupled to a thermal bath at infinite temperature .",
    "notice also that , although more complex variations of the svm could be considered , we purposefully focus on the simplest extension of the svm that includes a  free - will \" option ( or  failure \" option , if considered within the context of non - living systems )",
    ". indeed , it is our aim to preserve the minimal nature of the svm and show that , from the point of view of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , a qualitatively novel and distinct behavior arises from this simple extension .",
    "moreover , the svm is fully recovered by simply letting @xmath24 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the number of particles @xmath5 , the dimension of the displacement space @xmath25 , the linear size of the displacement space @xmath6 , the interaction radius @xmath8 , the particle density @xmath26 , the particle speed @xmath27 , the noise amplitude @xmath13 , and the individualistic probability @xmath0 .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 in the standard case , and that @xmath9 can be chosen as the unit of length . moreover , @xmath30 merely plays the role of a",
    " thermalization parameter \" that measures how many times , on average , two neighbors check out each other s positions while they remain at a distance within the unitary interaction radius . therefore , relative large values of speed ( typically @xmath31 ) correspond to the low - thermalization regime , characterized by highly anisotropic diffusion and the manifestation of simulation artifacts in the form of directionally quantized density waves ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in order to avoid spurious artifacts , we choose @xmath32 and the density value @xmath33 throughout , which are standard values in the vicsek model literature  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to pinpoint effects due to the @xmath2extension , we consider the small noise regime ( @xmath34 ) throughout and focus on the behavior of the system over a wide range of values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "also , finite - size effects are assessed by studying several system sizes in the range @xmath35 .    in our simulations , one time step is defined by the simultaneous update of velocities and positions for all @xmath5 particles in the system . for each set of parameter values , time series of @xmath36 time steps have been generated .",
    "all observables measured here are statistical averages within the steady - state regime , which is typically attained after @xmath37 time units .",
    "let us also point out that , for the largest system sizes studied here ( i.e. @xmath38 ) , generating this large number of steady - state configurations requires a significant computational effort .",
    "the well - studied svm exhibits a far - from - equilibrium continuous phase transition between ordered states of motion at low noise levels and disordered motion at high noise levels .",
    "the natural order parameter is given by the absolute value of the normalized mean velocity of the system  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is close to zero in the disordered phase and close to unity in the ordered phase . in order to analyze the critical nature of the svm",
    ", this noise - driven phase transition has been investigated by several approaches , e.g. finite - size scaling analysis and short - time critical dynamic techniques  @xcite .",
    "= 3.3 in    in this work , we explore the @xmath2extended vicsek model , where the parameter @xmath0 measures the probability for individualistic behavior ( see section 2 above for details ) . since we focus on the small - noise regime , the @xmath24 limit corresponds to the svm ordered phase .",
    "figure  [ order_par ] shows the order parameter @xmath40 as a function of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that a relatively small probability of individualistic motion , @xmath41 , is sufficient to drive the system from a vicsek - like ordered phase ( @xmath42 ) to a disordered phase ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "moreover , finite - size effects are mild , as indicated by the near - overlap of the plots of different system sizes in the range @xmath35 .",
    "the absence of significant finite - size effects near the transition region at @xmath41 suggests that the phase transition may be discontinuous ( first - order ) instead of the continuous ( second - order ) phase transition characteristic of the svm .",
    "indeed , the binder cumulant analysis presented below will provide very strong evidence to confirm the first - order nature of the phase transition and will also allow us to determine the transition value with great accuracy .",
    "the dashed straight line in figure  [ order_par ] shows the mean - field limit of @xmath40 vs @xmath0 for @xmath44 when all particles interact with each other , i.e. when @xmath45 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath46 ) . in this limiting case , a fraction @xmath0 of the system is formed by particles moving in random directions and",
    "therefore has a null contribution to the order parameter , while a fraction @xmath4 is fully aligned along the mean direction of motion of the whole system .",
    "thus , @xmath47 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in this limit of infinite density where the effective interaction becomes long - range , the transition from order to disorder is exactly located at @xmath48 .",
    "= 1.8 in    further qualitative insight can be gained by looking at the clustering of particles in typical snapshot configurations across the transition .",
    "notice that the standard order parameter for vicsek - like flocking phenomena , eq.([orpa ] ) , refers to the overall direction of motion of the particles .",
    "therefore , the spatial distribution of particles offers a related , complementary view of the degree of order in the system .",
    "figure  [ snapshots ] shows snapshot configurations for a system of size @xmath49 and different values for the individualistic probability @xmath0 , namely : ( a ) @xmath50 , ( b ) @xmath51 , and ( c ) @xmath52 .",
    "the low-@xmath0 regime ( fig .  [ snapshots](a ) ) is characterized by the existence of large flocks that are responsible for a system - wide , large - scale coherent motion .",
    "inbetween flocks , some regions display relatively large voids in which the particle density is very low . at the transition ( fig .  [ snapshots](b ) ) , the ordered flocks appear scattered throughout the system in coexistence with the disordered phase . notice also that flock sizes do not appear to depart significantly from the average flock size , i.e. the snapshot suggests that the flock size distribution does not follow a power law ( as would be expected if the transition were continuous ) .",
    "finally , the high-@xmath0 regime ( fig .  [ snapshots](c ) ) shows a configuration where individuals are nearly evenly distributed across the system and large flocks are absent , as expected for the disordered phase .",
    "thus , at a qualitative level , we observe that the spatial distribution of individuals exhibits different configurations that , as the parameter @xmath0 is increased , change from ordered to disordered through a state of phase coexistence . quantitative evidence for this first - order phase transition is provided by the so - called binder cumulant of vicsek s order parameter , as follows .",
    "the binder cumulant , defined by @xmath53 is a fourth - order cumulant dependent on the variance and the kurtosis of the order parameter probability distribution . since , for second - order phase transitions , the scaling prefactor of the cumulant is independent of the sample size , plots of @xmath54 versus the control parameter lead to a common ( size - independent ) intersection point that corresponds to the location of the critical value of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for first - order phase transitions , a characteristic signature is for @xmath54 to have a sharp fall towards negative values  @xcite .",
    "this hallmark behavior is somewhat elusive because it only appears for relatively large system sizes .",
    "= 3.3 in    figure  [ binder ] displays the binder cumulant as a function of the individualistic probability @xmath0 for different system sizes , as indicated . in agreement with previous figures ,",
    "the cumulant s behavior shows the existence of an @xmath2driven phase transition . furthermore ,",
    "although not apparent in the small system size ( @xmath49 ) , the results for the larger systems studied here ( @xmath55 ) show sharp minima at the transition point , which , as discussed above , is the signature behavior of discontinuous ( first - order ) phase transitions .",
    "the sharpness of these minima allows us to determine accurately the location of the transition at @xmath56 .",
    "= 3.3 in    a hallmark behavior of a discontinuous phase transition is the phenomenon of metastability . in equilibrium systems",
    ", this phenomenon results from the coexistence of two or more local minima of the free energy , where each minimum corresponds to one of the coexisting phases at the transition .",
    "in finite - size systems , fluctuations may drive the system from one local minimum to another one across the free energy barrier separating those ( meta)stable states . in our nonequilibrium model , an analogous behavior is observed in time series of the order parameter .",
    "figure  [ time_series ] shows the order parameter @xmath40 for a system of size @xmath57 as a function of time for different values of @xmath0 across the transition region .",
    "[ time_series](a ) corresponds to @xmath58 , i.e. below the phase transition .",
    "the system is pinned at the ordered phase and displays relatively small fluctuations around @xmath59 .",
    "notice also the transient regime from an initially fully disordered state a @xmath60 to the steady - state regime , which in this case is reached after @xmath61 .",
    "[ time_series](b ) corresponds to @xmath62 , where strong excursions are observed between one ordered ( meta)stable state at @xmath63 and one disordered ( meta)stable state at @xmath64 . by increasing slightly the control parameter to @xmath51 , fig .",
    "[ time_series](c ) shows that the ordered metastable state becomes less likely than the disordered one .",
    "this strong sensitivity to small variations in @xmath0 is in agreement with the sharp transition displayed by the binder cumulant ( fig .",
    "[ binder ] above ) . by increasing the control",
    "parameter further to @xmath65 , as shown by fig .",
    "[ time_series](d ) , the system stays mostly in the disordered state .",
    "in fact , excursions to the ordered metastable state become noticeably shorter in duration and much more sporadic .",
    "= 3.3 in    the phenomenon of metastability is also reflected in the behavior of the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of the order parameter across the transition region .",
    "figure  [ op_pdf ] shows the order parameter probability distribution functions for a system of size @xmath57 and the same values of @xmath0 used in the previous figure . in fig .",
    "[ op_pdf](a ) , the distribution for @xmath58 is unimodal and centered around @xmath59 , i.e. the order parameter has small fluctuations around the positive mean value that characterizes the ordered phase .",
    "[ op_pdf](b ) , which corresponds to the transition value @xmath62 , is a bimodal distribution with two similar peaks associated with the coexistence of the ordered and disordered phases . in fig .",
    "[ op_pdf](c ) , which was obtained with @xmath51 , one observes that the peak corresponding to the disordered phase becomes dominant , although the distribution is still bimodal .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ op_pdf](d ) represents the disordered regime for @xmath65 , where the local maximum associated with the ordered phase has completely vanished . as a summary ,",
    "the panels of figure  [ op_pdf ] display the occurrence of a sharp order - disorder transition that takes place within a very narrow range of values of @xmath0 .",
    "the hallmark of a discontinuous phase transition , in which the two phases coexist , becomes evident by the bimodal probability distribution function of the order parameter at the transition , i.e. @xmath66 . below the transition within the ordered phase @xmath67 , the peak corresponding to the disordered phase vanishes ; and viceversa , above the transition within the disordered phase @xmath68 , the peak associated with the ordered phase vanishes and the peak corresponding to the disordered phase prevails .",
    "= 3.3 in    so far , we have focused on the effects of adding individualistic motion , as controlled by the parameter @xmath0 , on vicsek - like self - propelled particles within the small - noise regime ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "let us now investigate the behavior of the @xmath2extended model under non - negligible noise amplitudes .",
    "figure  [ binder_eta ] shows the binder cumulant as a function of the individualistic probability @xmath0 for @xmath57 and different noise amplitudes , as indicated .",
    "for very small noise amplitudes , e.g. @xmath69 , the binder cumulant shows a sharp minimum at the transition , which as we have discussed above , is a characteristic signature of first - order phase transitions ( recall fig .",
    "[ binder ] ) . as the noise amplitude is increased , however , the minima become less noticeable and appear shifted towards smaller values of @xmath0 . increasing the noise amplitude beyond the pure - vicsek critical transition , i.e. @xmath70  @xcite , all signatures of a transition vanish and the binder cumulant appears flat , no longer depending on the parameter @xmath0 . based on these findings",
    ", we are able to sketch a phase diagram in the @xmath13 vs @xmath0 parameter space , as displayed in the inset to fig .",
    "[ binder_eta ] . on the one hand , transition points with characteristic first - order signatures",
    "are shown by filled circles .",
    "on the other hand , the collective motion transition in the pure - vicsek limit with @xmath71 has been characterized as second - order  @xcite ; for the velocity and density parameters used in this work , the continuous second - order phase transition has been located at @xmath72  @xcite ( shown by a star in the inset to fig .",
    "[ binder_eta ] ) .    certainly , the fact that the smooth @xmath2extension of the svm changes the critical nature of the system is very intriguing .",
    "indeed , these findings are a display of the richness of the swarming phenomenon even when represented by means of a minimal nonequilibrium model such as vicsek s . as an example of a rich equilibrium minimal model , in which the critical nature of the underlying system is modified by the addition of a hamiltonian term that preserves the model symmetries , the interaction range and the dimensionality ,",
    "let us mention the blume - capel extension of the classical ising model  @xcite .",
    "the blume - capel model adds a symmetry - preserving term proportional to a crystal field @xmath73 that favors impurities ( @xmath74 states ) over up / down spins ( @xmath75 states ) . in the @xmath76 limit",
    ", the blume - capel model tends smoothly to the classical two - state ising model .",
    "however , in some regions of the @xmath77 parameter space , the order - disorder phase transition becomes discontinuous ( first - order ) and a tricritical point can be determined .",
    "reasoning by analogy , and based on the results discussed above , we therefore conjecture the existence of a tricritical point ( as indicated in the inset to fig .",
    "[ binder_eta ] ) , which would separate the standard noise - driven continuous transition from the @xmath2driven discontinuous transition reported here .",
    "the existence of such phenomenon , however , remains an open question that lies beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in this work , we investigated the so - called @xmath2extended vicsek model , in which a parameter @xmath0 was introduced to control the gregarious _ vs _ individualistic behavior of particle motion . by focusing on the small - noise regime , we showed that a relatively small probability of independent particle motion was sufficient to drive the system from a vicsek - like ordered phase to a disordered phase .",
    "indeed , the order parameter and its associated fourth - order binder cumulant showed very strong evidence of a discontinuous , first - order phase transition occurring at @xmath78 .",
    "further qualitative and quantitative insight into the nature of the transition was provided by snapshot configurations , time series of the order parameter , as well as probability distribution functions of the order parameter .",
    "the aims of the present study were two - fold .",
    "on the one hand , by extending the well - studied standard vicsek model ( svm ) to novel scenarios of particle behavior ( while preserving , at the same time , its nature as a minimal model ) , we may account for important features of real self - propelled particle systems that are not captured by the svm , as for instance free - will behavior in biological systems and random failures in robotic and other artificial systems .",
    "moreover , on the other hand , we found a theoretically intriguing manifestation of the richness of the swarming phenomenon , namely that the @xmath2driven phase transition was discontinuous ( first - order ) , despite the fact that the @xmath2extended model preserved the @xmath3 symmetry , the interaction range , as well as the dimensionality of the underlying svm .    by analogy to equilibrium systems such as the blume - capel extension of the classical ising model , we conjecture the existence of a tricritical point in the @xmath79 parameter space of the @xmath2extended model , which would separate the standard noise - driven continuous transition from the @xmath2driven discontinuous transition reported here .",
    "indeed , the existence of such phenomenon remains a very interesting open question that certainly deserves further investigation .",

    "<S> we show that a relatively small probability of individualistic motion ( around @xmath1 ) is sufficient to drive the system from a vicsek - like ordered phase to a disordered phase . despite the fact that the @xmath2extended model preserves the @xmath3 symmetry , the interaction range , as well as the dimensionality of the underlying svm , this novel phase transition is found to be discontinuous ( first - order ) , an intriguing manifestation of the richness of the nonequilibrium flocking / swarming phenomenon . </S>"
