    "a dynamic equation , such as newton s equation or the schrdinger s equation , describes only dynamical processes and strictly speaking it does not describe evolution towards thermal equilibrium , although sometimes it is used to do so together with a presumed thermal equilibrium distribution , such as in the derivation of kubo formula of linear response theory@xcite .",
    "starting from the dynamic equation and its corresponding bbgky hierarchy@xcite the uniqueness of a stationary solution at thermal equilibrium , and particularly being the boltzmann distribution , remains as an assumption but not a proved theorem@xcite .",
    "the redfield equation@xcite , although it may show an unphysical transient process due to the use of the markov approximation , on the other hand puts the description of dynamical evolution , thermal evolution towards the equilibrium state and evolution towards non - equilibrium stationary states ( nesss ) under a common framework .",
    "the redfield equation has long been a standard tool in the study of the relaxation process in the theory of nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite , optical spectroscopy and chemical dynamical systems@xcite . due to the fact that usually in those studies the central system of interest is modeled by a hamiltonian with a very low dimension ,",
    "the lack of an efficient algorithm to solve the redfield equation , other than direct diagonalization and direct integration , is not a serious problem .",
    "however , when the redfield equation is applied to transport calculations , the size of the system is usually much larger .",
    "it is then necessary to have a more efficient way to find the nesss , without which many physical questions remain unanswered .",
    "a famous example is the validity of the phenomenology law of transport .",
    "advancement in science and technology has made it possible to build nanoscale electronic devices@xcite , where classical phenomenological laws of transport such as fourier s law and ohm s law may not be valid any more@xcite . in order to construct a theory of transport for mesoscopic or microscopic systems , and also to check under what circumstances those phenomenological laws hold , one may start from the first principles , i.e. the dynamic equation of classical or quantum systems , and add in as few extra assumptions as possible .",
    "the landauer formula@xcite makes use of scattering waves from the schrdinger s equation but a biased distribution of those waves is assumed to calculate physical quantities .",
    "the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method starts from two decoupled systems each at their own thermal equilibrium states , which could be very far from the expected non - equilibrium stationary states ( nesss ) , and treats coupling between the two systems perturbatively@xcite . for interacting systems ,",
    "usually negf is used together with the density functional method@xcite , from which the whole spectrum and corresponding effective wavefunctions are calculated to construct the non - equilibrium density matrix .",
    "both the perturbation and the effective wavefunctions introduce further approximations to the calculation .    the redfield equation approach to studying transport phenomena is to explicitly couple the system of interest , @xmath6 , to reservoirs and then use the projector technique@xcite to derive an effective equation of motion for the system .",
    "one then solves this redfield equation to get nesss .",
    "the redfield equation requires validity of the markovian approximation and treats the coupling between system and reservoirs within second - order perturbation .",
    "this generalization of the redfield equation to transport studies was first implemented by saito@xcite and more or less followed by others@xcite . in such cases",
    "one quite often expects to deal with systems with size @xmath7 in order to be comparable to other methods such as the landauer formula and negf@xcite .",
    "this then leads to a hilbert space with dimension @xmath8 , when we for example consider an @xmath0-site chain of spinless fermions with @xmath9 , meaning a matrix with dimension @xmath10 in the corresponding redfield equation . due to this exponential increasing of the problem size , and the lack of a more efficient alternative method",
    ", currently one can only discuss physical behaviors of very small systems with @xmath11@xcite .",
    "conclusions drawn from numerical results for such small systems are not regarded as reliable enough . in this work",
    ", we will present a new approach , using the idea of a bbgky hierarchy to study this kinetic equation .",
    "this allows us to develop very efficient and systematic approximate methods to find nesss .",
    "a general redfield equation can be cast into the following form@xcite ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 $ ] is the hamiltonian of the central system .",
    "sometimes we also use @xmath14 to separate @xmath6 into non - interacting part @xmath15 and interaction @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath19 comes from coupling to baths with coupling strength @xmath20 , and @xmath21 exists when baths have different temperatures and/or chemical potentials .",
    "this equation describes a dynamical process when @xmath22 , thermal relaxation towards equilibrium when @xmath23 , and evolution towards nesss when they are all nonzero .",
    "if we are interested in the long - time steady - state solution @xmath24 , then @xmath25 which is sometimes called a stationary redfield equation .",
    "here @xmath26 is a matrix with dimension @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dimension of the systems hilbert space , for example , @xmath29 for the @xmath0-site chain of spinless fermions mentioned above .",
    "solving this equation is very costly computationally .",
    "it involves solving a linear system@xcite or an eigenvalue system@xcite with dimension @xmath3 plus an eigenvalue system with dimension @xmath4 .",
    "currently , for interacting central systems , one usually can only solve the redfield equation numerically up to @xmath30@xcite while for non - interacting systems , the equation with @xmath0 around a hundred can be solved in terms of single - particle green s functions ( gfs)@xcite . for example , for non - interacting systems , in ref .",
    ", a closed equation of single - particle gfs , @xmath31 , was derived from the stationary redfield equation eq and solved .",
    "our idea is basically to extend this gf based solution of the redfield equation for non - interacting systems onto interacting systems .",
    "we consider @xmath32 , gfs in the lattice basis , and derive an equation for these gfs . in the presence of interaction , the single - particle gfs @xmath32 , generally denoted as @xmath33 , will be coupled to the two - particle gfs @xmath34 , also generally denoted as @xmath35 , which are then coupled to three - particle gfs , @xmath36 , also generally denoted as @xmath37 and so on .",
    "we arrive at a bbgky - like equation hierarchy@xcite .    in principle , solving the whole hierarchy is as hard as solving directly the redfield equation .",
    "the hierarchy has to be truncated first and then solved . in the rest part of this paper , after deriving the hierarchy from the redfield equation , we will then present two such methods . in the example calculations , we will only truncate the hierarchy at the first equation of the hierarchy .",
    "the first method substitutes value of @xmath35 at equilibrium for the unknown @xmath35 appearing in the first equation while the second expresses @xmath35 as combinations of @xmath33 via cluster expansion . after either one , the equation is closed and then solved .",
    "we will see in the following that both methods are significantly more efficient than the direct methods .",
    "the first one is capable of dealing with relatively small systems but with large interaction strength while the second one can deal with much larger systems but with relatively small interaction strength .",
    "for concreteness in presenting our general formulation , let us start from a redfield equation describing an @xmath0-site chain of spinless fermions coupled with two fermionic baths .",
    "our system of interest is defined by @xmath6 ,    @xmath38    the two heat baths are collections of fermionic modes , @xmath39 where @xmath40 indexes the left and right - side baths and we set @xmath41 , the lattice constant @xmath42 and hopping constant @xmath43 .",
    "the system - baths coupling is chosen as : @xmath44 where the left ( right ) bath is coupled to the first ( last ) site : @xmath45 and @xmath46 and so on .",
    "bath parameters , including temperature and chemical potential , are chosen to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 . in the present work , the induced @xmath50 term in eq , is neglected .",
    "the corresponding redfield equation reads@xcite ,    @xmath51-\\lambda^2\\sum_{\\alpha = l , r}^{}\\left\\ { \\left[c^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } , \\hat{m}_{\\alpha } \\rho(t)\\right ] + \\left[c_{\\alpha } , \\hat{\\bar{m}}_{\\alpha } \\rho(t)\\right ] + h.c.\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52(@xmath53 ) is related to @xmath54(@xmath55 ) and @xmath56(@xmath57 ) is related to @xmath58(@xmath59)@xcite ,    [ ms ] @xmath60    here @xmath61 is the fermi - dirac distribution with the bath temperature @xmath62 and chemical potential @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 is known , then so is @xmath65 and therefore the operators @xmath66 .",
    "this requires a full diagonalization of @xmath6 . using eigenvectors of @xmath6",
    ", one can perform the above integrals to get operator @xmath66s .",
    "detail is included in appendix [ sec : mperturbation ] .",
    "there we will also see that change of variable between summation over @xmath67 and integration over energy in eq involves the density of states of the baths @xmath68 .",
    "we combine this density of states together with coupling constant @xmath69 , and set @xmath70 ( see appendix [ sec : mperturbation ] for detail ) as an overall constant , which is included in @xmath71 .",
    "when only a long - time steady - state solution @xmath24 is of interest , we may derive a stationary form , eq , from the kinetic redfield equation .",

    "all equations of gfs in the rest of this paper will be derived from this equation .",
    "for example the first and the second equation of the hierarchy can be derived from using @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq ,    [ a : g1g2 ] @xmath80    and    [ a : g2g3 ] @xmath81    note that since the set of all polynomials of @xmath82 forms a complete basis of the operator space , operators @xmath66 are certain functions of polynomials of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , as expected @xmath33 is coupled to @xmath35 from eq , and possibly also @xmath37 or higher gfs from eq , and @xmath35 is coupled to @xmath37 from eq , and possibly also @xmath83 or higher gfs from eq .",
    "solving such an equation hierarchy is no easier than directly solving the redfield equation , unless @xmath84 so that the above equation of @xmath33 is closed and is not coupled to @xmath35 .    we may , however , solve these equations by truncating the hierarchy at certain order with some further approximations , such as the molecular - chaos assumption in the classical boltzmann equation@xcite , or replacing high order gfs by cluster expansion of lower order ones@xcite . in this work , we suggest the following two approximate methods : @xmath85 substitution of certain high - order gfs by their values at equilibrium ; @xmath86 expressing high - order gfs as combinations of lower - order ones plus a correlation part via cluster expansion and then ignoring the correlation part at certain order . specifically in the following example calculation , the first - order form of both approximations , i.e. only the first equation of the hierarchy is used and substitution or cluster expansion is preformed on @xmath35 .",
    "one can do such a substitution or cluster expansion of gfs at further - order gfs and make use of further equations in the hierarchy .",
    "a general discussion of accuracy of such substitutions at different orders will be presented elsewhere . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the potential of this bbgky - like formulation and discuss briefly the topic of performance of the two approximations in their first - order forms .",
    "in order to solve eq explicitly , we will first have to find explicit forms of operators @xmath66 in terms of operator @xmath82 . in the following",
    "we will present one exact numerical calculation and one perturbative calculation of those operators .",
    "correspondingly based on these two methods of finding operators @xmath66 , we will discuss in this section two ways of making eq to be a closed equation by dealing with @xmath35 terms in the equation differently .",
    "we will first discuss a more accurate even for a large @xmath87 but computationally costly method , perturbation based on two - particle gfs at equilibrium .",
    "next we will discuss a relatively less accurate but computationally much cheaper method , the non - equilibrium cluster expansion .",
    "the later works only for relatively small @xmath87 but it can be applied on much larger systems .",

    "<S> other currently available direct methods correspond to a linear system or an eigenvalue system with dimension @xmath3 plus an eigenvalue system with dimension @xmath4 . as a test of the methods , for small systems with size @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , results are found to be consistent with results made available by other direct methods . </S>",
    "<S> although not discussed here , extending both methods to their next levels is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a promising potential for this bbgky - like approach of non - equilibrium kinetic equations . </S>"
