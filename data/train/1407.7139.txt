    "schwinger approach  @xcite has also had some success .",
    "an alternative is a hamiltonian approach based on light - front quantization  @xcite , which has the advantage of providing boost - invariant wave functions ; such a formulation is much more intuitive , and , of the three , it is the only one formulated in minkowski space .",
    "light - front quantization is done in terms of dirac s light - front coordinates  @xcite , where @xmath1 is time and the corresponding spatial coordinate is @xmath2 .",
    "the transverse coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 remain as they were .",
    "the conjugate variables of light - front energy and momentum are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "again , the transverse components @xmath7 are unchanged .",
    "the mass - shell condition @xmath8 then implies @xmath9 .",
    "however , here we will be concerned with a two - dimensional theory , and the transverse components do not enter .",
    "the two - dimensional light - front hamiltonian eigenvalue problem is  @xcite , p^-|(p^+)=|(p^+ ) ^+|(p^+)=p^+|(p^+ ) , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the light - front energy and momentum operators .",
    "the second equation is automatically satisfied by expanding the eigenstate in fock states that are themselves eigenstates of @xmath11 . for @xmath12 bosons with individual momenta @xmath13",
    ", we have the total momentum @xmath14 and the fock states @xmath15 .",

    "the factor @xmath16 is explicit in order that @xmath17 be independent of @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem now becomes an infinite set of integral equations for the fock - state wave functions .",
    "the standard approximation made is to truncate the expansion to a finite number of terms , yielding a finite set of equations . in many theories ,",
    "such a truncation causes difficulties with respect to regularization and renormalization , because the truncation in particle number removes infinite contributions that would ordinarily cancel against contributions that are retained .",
    "this is the nonperturbative analog of separating a feynman diagram into time - ordered diagrams and throwing away diagrams that have more than some specified number of intermediate particles ; the remaining approximation to the feynman diagram will generally be divergent , even if the original covariant diagram was finite .",
    "one proposed resolution of this difficulty is sector - dependent renormalizaton  @xcite , where infinities caused by truncation are absorbed by allowing the bare masses and couplings to depend on the fock sectors involved .",
    "however , this can lead to ill - defined wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the light - front coupled - cluster ( lfcc ) method  @xcite avoids this by not truncating fock space .",
    "instead , the eigenstate is built as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a normalizing factor , @xmath21 is a valence state with the smallest possible number of constituents , and @xmath22 is an operator that increases particle number .",
    "the truncation made is a truncation of @xmath22 ; the exponentiation then builds all higher fock states , giving them wave functions that depend on the valence wave functions and on the functions in the truncated @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem becomes a valence equation [ eq : valence ] p_v|=| , with @xmath23 the effective lfcc hamiltonian and @xmath24 the projection onto the valence fock sector .",
    "this is supplemented by an auxiliary equation for @xmath22 [ eq : aux ] ( 1-p_v)|=0 . without truncation , these equations provide an exact representation of the original eigenvalue problem . when @xmath22 is truncated , the projection @xmath25 must also be truncated , to retain only enough equations to solve for the functions retained in @xmath22 .",
    "of course , the valence eigenvalue problem and the auxiliary equation must be solved simultaneously .",
    "one immediate advantage is that the physical mass of the eigenstate appears in the kinetic - energy terms of the effective hamiltonian , without use of sector - dependent renormalization .",
    "the price to be paid is that the auxiliary equation is nonlinear in the functions that determine @xmath22 .",
    "when this approach is applied to a simple soluble model  @xcite , one finds that the simplest truncation of @xmath22 is sufficient to generate the exact answer analytically  @xcite . as a first realistic application , where a truncation is an approximation and where numerical methods are required , we consider here the odd - parity sector of light - front @xmath26 theory in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the valence state is the one - particle state , and the @xmath27 operator generates all the higher odd - particle - number fock states .",
    "the @xmath22 operator is truncated to a single term that creates two additional particles . by itself",
    ", this would only couple the three - particle state , but the exponentiation of @xmath22 still generates all the higher odd states .",
    "the truncated @xmath22 operator depends on a single function of two relative momenta . the auxiliary equation ( [ eq : aux ] ) is restricted to a projection onto the three - particle state , to provide an equation for this function .",
    "we solve this equation numerically with use of an expansion in a basis of symmetric multivariate polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the valence eigenvalue problem then yields the mass @xmath28 of the eigenstate .",
    "we limit the calculation to one without symmetry breaking .",
    "the negative mass - squared case , with its wine - bottle potential , requires careful consideration of the vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "an extension of the lfcc method to handle this has been developed  @xcite , but we do not apply it here , in order to not complicate the discussion of this first numerical lfcc application .    instead , we focus on a comparison of the lfcc calculation with a fock - space truncation calculation . specifically , we consider a truncation that yields the same number of equations and therefore the same computational effort ( aside from the nonlinearity in the lfcc equations ) .",
