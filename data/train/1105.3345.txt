    "intensity variations have long been recognized as a defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "variability is a powerful tool for probing agn geometry and physical properties such as the black hole mass , and the sizes and bulk motions of the outflows in their innermost regions that are well beyond the current imaging capabilities of telescopes in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. , wagner & witzel 1995 ; urry & padovani 1995 ; xie et al .",
    "the variations can be particularly violent for those agns whose flux is dominated by relativistic jets of nonthermal radiation broadly pointing in our direction ( e.g. , begelman , blandford & rees 1984 ) .",
    "intensities of such agns , called ` blazars ' , are known to vary across the entire electromagnetic spectrum and time scales from minutes to years have been observed .",
    "for instance , in the soft x - ray band , several tev emitting blazars have been found to vary on a characteristic time scale of @xmath21 day , with the flares having sub - structures on shorter time scales of @xmath6s ( e.g. , tanihata et al .",
    "2001 ; kataoka et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the optical regime",
    ", there have been many detections of intra - night optical variability ( inov ) , or optical microvariability , following the pioneering work of carini , miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) who first used ccd detectors as multi - object photometers for this purpose .",
    "the shortest time scale found for essentially all inov events is around 1 hour , with an amplitude of a few percent ( e.g. , xie et al .",
    "2001 ; romero et al .  2002 ; stalin et al .",
    ". such rapid continuum variability of blazars is usually explained by invoking relativistic jets ( e.g. , marscher 1996 ; schlickeiser 1996 ; wiita 2006 ) .    a study of 23 agn of the quasar / seyfert1 type ( i.e. , non - blazar ) yielded a @xmath7 upper limit of 0.03 mag for variability on hour - like timescales ( webb & malkan 2000 ) .",
    "the literature does contain reports of a few inov detections on time scales much shorter than 1 hour .",
    "examples include the papers by kidger & dediego ( 1990 ) , sagar , gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1996 ) , xie et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and dai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; however , see romero et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a convincing critique of the latter two claims . to our knowledge",
    "such assertions are lacking in the literature over the past 5 years or so , aside from a very recent paper presenting evidence for a quasi - periodic oscillation of @xmath8 15 min spanning most of a night of optical monitoring of the tev blazar s5 0716@xmath5714 ( rani et al .",
    "2010 ) , which is also a member of our present sample . very recently ,",
    "impiombato et al . (",
    "2011 ) have reported a single event of duration @xmath225 minutes in @xmath9-band while searching for long and short term optical and infrared variability for blazar pks0537@xmath10441 in the data spanning for @xmath26 years ( 2004 - 2009 ) .",
    "there is thus a need for renewed efforts capable of making robust detections of events of ultra - rapid inov events on sub - hour time scales .    since @xmath11ray emission is known to be correlated with relatively large bulk doppler factors of the radiating plasma in the blazar jets for both the gev band probed by egret ( e.g. , kellermann et al .",
    "2004 ; lister & homan 2005 ) and the higher energies probed by fermi / lat ( kovalev et al .  2009 ; savolainen et al .",
    "2010 ) , tev blazars appear to be particularly promising candidates for detecting the most rapid inov . in tev blazars ,",
    "the relativistic plasma of the inner jets almost certainly must move with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath12 4550 in order to escape absorption of the tev photons due to the pair production process in the radiation field present near the origin ( e.g. , krawczynski , coppi & aharonian 2002 ; begelman , fabian & rees 2008 ; for large lorentz factors in blazar jets , also see kundt & gopal - krishna 1980 , 2004 ) . according to one model",
    ", such ultra - fast moving emission features may arise in situ within the jet , e.g. , from reconnection events in a poynting flux dominated jet ( giannios , uzdensky & begelman 2009 ) .",
    "thus , it seems likely that in tev blazars the bulk lorentz factors of the optically radiating inner segments of the jets are also comparatively larger than those occuring in other blazars .",
    "here we note that the marked paucity of apparent superluminal motion in the jets of tev blazars , highlighted by piner & edwards ( 2004 ) , can be reconciled with the above requirement of extreme bulk lorentz factors in a number of ways , e.g. , by taking into account a modest opening angle for the jet ( gopal - krishna , dhurde & wiita 2004 ; gopal - krishna , wiita & dhurde 2006 ; gopal - krishna et al .   2007 ; petrucci , boutelier & henri 2010 ) , or by postulating a spine - sheath geometry for the sub - parsec scale jets ( e.g. , attridge , roberts & wardle 1999 ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 2004 ) or , alternatively , if the bulk of the @xmath11rays come from an ultra - relativistically approaching volume element in the jet ( e.g. , giannios et al .",
    "2009 ; also , gopal - krishna , singal & krishnamohan 1984 ) .    in sect .  2 we describe the selection of our sample of tev blazars for intranight optical monitoring .",
    "our observations are described in sect .  3 and the results summarized in sect .  4 , followed by a discussion in sect .  5",
    "our sample of tev blazars consists of two sets .",
    "set 1 is derived from the list of tev detected extragalactic agn , published by weekes ( 2008 ; table 2 of his paper ) .",
    "application of the criteria , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 to that list leaves us with 9 tev blazars .",
    "the redshift limit is designed to exclude the nearest blazars so that the optical image should have a point - like appearence .",
    "this is to ensure that the host galaxy makes a negligible contribution to the image , a pre - requisite for high precision photometry .",
    "the declination and the apparent magnitude limits are meant to ensure a sufficiently dense sampling and reasonably long duration ( @xmath16 hours ) for the continuum light curves obtained with the 1 @xmath10 2 metre class telescopes employed in this programme .",
    "the 9 tev blazars constituting set 1 are : tev1219@xmath5283 , tev1429@xmath5427 , tev0809@xmath5524 , tev1218@xmath5304 , tev1011@xmath5496 , tev0716@xmath5714 , tev1553@xmath511 , tev0219@xmath5425 and tev1256@xmath10058 , listed in increasing order of distance from us .",
    "the intra - night and long - term optical lightcurves of these 9 blazars are derived in this study and presented here .",
    "our set 2 of tev blazars was derived from table 1 of abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , consisting of 709 tev detected agns , which is based on 11 months of monitoring with @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "this set consists of 13 blazars , including 10 high polarization core - dominated quasars ( hpcdqs ) and 3 bl lac objects .",
    "the hpcdqs were selected employing the following criteria : all cdqs labeled `` hp '' ( @xmath19 per cent ) in the compendium of vron & vron ( 2006 ) were subjected to the aformentioned selection criteria , namely , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath20 . to ensure the availability of inov data additional selection filters used are :",

    "the agn is termed ` v ' for @xmath65 , corresponding to a nominal confidence level above 0.99 .",
    "the  probable ` variable ' ( pv ) classification applies when , @xmath66 , corresponding to a nominal confidence level between 0.95 to 0.99 .",
    "it has been recently argued by de diego ( 2010 ) , however , that @xmath3 is not a proper statistic as it is based on ratios of standard deviations and not on ratios of variances ; only the latter are distributed in such a way that @xmath67 tests can be used to assign proper confidence levels .",
    "he shows that the standard @xmath68-statistic , where @xmath69 is a more appropriate choice for characterizing agn light curves .",
    "it also has the advantage that the somewhat uncertain parameter , @xmath63 , cancels out .",
    "12 gives the @xmath68-value for each night along with the number of degrees of freedom shown in parentheses .",
    "since we can compute the @xmath68-statistic only for our data , for the bulk of blazars in set 2 ( not observed by us ) only the @xmath3-values are available . in computing the @xmath68-values we examined the various star  star light curves to decide if any of the comparison stars might have even slightly varied on that night .",
    "we considered the steadiest two of the three comparison stars and selected the one closer to the blazar in apparent magnitude . the two dlcs ( namely , blazar@xmath10star and star@xmath10star ) involving the selected comparison star",
    "were then used in the @xmath68-test ( eq .",
    "1 ) . for a fair comparison to the @xmath3-test , we take for the @xmath68-test a significance of @xmath70 0.99 to correspond to a definitely variable source ( v ) and a significance between 0.95 and 0.99 to correspond to the pv classification .",
    "these indicators of variability status as computed using @xmath68-test are tabulated in the 13th column .",
    "the last column gives the reference(s ) for the inov data used here .",
    "the peak - to - peak inov amplitude is calculated using the definition ( romero et al . , 1999 )",

    "( 1999 ) ( see also , stalin et al .",
    "2004a ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the duration of the blazar monitoring session on the @xmath79 night , corrected for the blazar s cosmological redshift , @xmath80 .",
    "note that since the monitoring durations for any given source on different nights were not equal , the computation of dc has been weighted by the actual monitoring duration @xmath81 on the @xmath79 night .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 was set equal to 1 if inov was detected ; otherwise @xmath82 = 0 .",
    "we realize that 2 of our 9 blazars in set 1 lie at rather small redshifts ( table 1 ; j1221 + 2813 at @xmath80 = 0.102 and j1428@xmath54240 at @xmath83 ) , raising the possibility of a significant contribution from the host galaxy to the flux falling within the circular photometry aperture centered at the blazar .",
    "as stressed by , e.g. , cellone , romero & combi ( 2000 ) , the host s varying contribution to the flux within the aperture changes as the seeing varies and thus the atmospheric seeing changes can yield spurious inov detection .",
    "the paper also presents simulated dlcs for agn , relative to a suitable comparison star , for cases where the emission from the agn host galaxy ( elliptical or spiral ) is comparable to that from the agn itself and the atmospheric seeing undergoes a large intranight variation . for a wide range in the host galaxy size ,",
    "they find that even if the host s flux is comparable to that of the agn ( an extreme situation from the perspective of the present sample ) , the dlcs show a negligible variation ( @xmath84 ) as long as the aperture radius exceeds @xmath85 and the seeing remains within this limit ( as also applicable to the present study ) . therefore",
    ", since our choice of aperture size always meets this condition , we do not expect any of our dlcs classified as ` v ' to be spurious , i.e. , being an artefact of variable atmospheric seeing during the night .",
    "note also that in a very small number of cases the inov results taken from the literature were for the v band ; however , for the present purpose we do not distinguish them from our data which were essentially always taken in the r band .",
    "based on the @xmath3-test the computed inov dc for our sample of 22 tev blazars is found to be @xmath86 per cent ( 116 nights ; table 3 ) , which increases to @xmath87 per cent if five ` pv ' cases of ` probable ' inov are also included . however , for the nights showing larger inov amplitudes , @xmath88 , the inov dc is @xmath89 per cent . since the redshift",
    "the blazar j1555 + 1111 is known to be controversial , with values ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 ( see , treves , falomo & uslenghi , 2007 and magic collaboration : albert et al . 2008 ) we have computed the @xmath90 vlaues for our entire sample of blazars ( 116 nights ) , taking the lower and upper @xmath80 values for j1555 + 1111 .",
    "the computed values are @xmath90 = 58.6% and @xmath90 = 58.9% , respectively .",

    "the k - s test rejects at the @xmath139 per cent confidence level the hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent population .",

    "this result must be accounted for in physical models of inov and tev emission from blazars .",
    "a striking outcome of our search for ultra - rapid inov is the detection of a curious , sharp feature in the light curve of the hbl j1555@xmath51111 ( on 24 june 2009 ; fig .  1 ) , the most optically luminous member of set 1 ( table 1 ) .",
    "intriguingly , instead of being a flare , as is more typical , this essentially symmetric feature is a clear `` dip '' , with an amplitude of @xmath2 4.2 per cent .",
    "its initial , falling side extends 0.5 hour and the rising side is of a slightly longer duration .",
    "we treat this detection as robust , since ( i ) the profile of the `` dip '' is well resolved ( 8 data points ) ; ( ii ) its peak amplitude is @xmath70 20 times the rms noise of individual data points ; ( iii ) the variation is visible with equal clarity and amplitude on the dlcs of the blazar against all the 3 comparison stars ; ( iv ) the 3 comparison stars are all within 0.8 magnitude of the blazar ; ( v ) all 3 comparison stars remained rock - steady through the monitoring duration ; and ( vi ) the atmospheric seeing too remained steady throughout the monitoring session ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "all these points , along with the fact that in the dlcs , the brightness levels seen immediately prior to and just after the dip are fairly steady and well matched , _ make this feature by far the most credible , if not the only , case of an emission dip ( on an hour - like time scale ) detected in the optical continuum light received from a blazar_. in addition , the blazar was substantially brighter on both other nights it was monitored by us ( table 3 ) , making it quite unlikely that the elevated flux levels seen just before and after the dip in the light curves of 24 june 2009 are a result of multiple flares occuring at those times .",
    "the robust detection of the dip , combined with its temporal sharpness , calls for an explanation . a plausible scenario for",
    "this rare feature would be that the optical continuum from the jet was temporarily absorbed by a foreground dusty cloud in the nuclear region .",
    "an emerging picture of agn broad emission line clouds suggests they form at the distances from the central continuum source where the temperature becomes low enough for dust formation ( i.e. , @xmath140 k ) and these dusty clouds then form a dust - driven wind ( e.g. , czerny & hryniewicz 2010 ; also , krongold , binnete & hernandez - ibarra 2010 ) . recalling that the low - level detection ( or non - detection ) of emission lines in the case of bl lacs could well be due to a paucity of energetic photons to ionise the gas clouds existing around the central engine ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ) , it is plausible that a dusty cloud , or a stream of such clouds happens to be on our line of sight to a superluminally moving optical synchrotron ` knot ' in the jet . to see",
    "if this could explain the `` dip '' , we need an estimate of the size of an optically emitting knot in blazar jets . here",
    "a reasonable expectation would be that optical knots already exist in the jet before the point where the knot becomes visible in the radio band ( e.g.  marscher et al .",
    "2008 ) ; that point typically occurs at a distance , @xmath141 @xmath142 times the gravitational radius of the central supermassive black hole ( lobanov 2010 ) . for a typical supermassive black hole of mass @xmath143",
    ", the radio visibility point would thus be about @xmath144 cm away from the nucleus , from which a size of around @xmath137 cm can be reasonably inferred for the optical knot in the jet .",
    "the observed time scale of the optical continuum dip ( @xmath140 sec ) , if interpreted in terms of an occultation of the superluminal knot by a dusty gaseous cloud ( see above ) , would then require a relative transverse speed of order of @xmath145 ( see gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 for such a scenario ) .",
    "the corresponding bulk lorentz factor of the inner jet , @xmath146 for viewing angle @xmath147 2@xmath25 , is not unreasonable for a tev blazar ( sect .",
    "one prediction of this scenario is that any such rapid intensity dips should appear more pronounced in b - band light curves , because of their greater sensitivity to dust obscuration , as compared to the r - band light curves .",
    "finally , searches for minute - like time scales in the optical light curves of blazars , a key motivation for the present work , have acquired added significance in the present fermi / lat era ( atwood et al .",
    "a few recent studies of blazars have revealed a tight physical relationship between @xmath11ray and optical flaring events , strongly suggesting a spatial coincidence between their origins , which could well be in the jet s knot crossing a standing shock , located up to several parsecs from the central engine ( see , e.g. , agudo et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "more specifically , a recent study of blazars ( ammando et al .  2010 ) has revealed that polarized optical emission from their jets is spatially coincident with the site of the tev flares observed on minute - like time scales .",

    "<S> in this first systematic attempt to characterise the intranight optical variability ( inov ) of tev detected blazars , we have monitored a well defined set of 9 tev blazars on total 26 nights during 2004 - 2010 . in this @xmath0 ( or @xmath1)-band monitoring programme only one blazar was monitored per night and the minimum duration was close to 4 hours , the average being 5.3 hours per night . using the ccd for strictly simultaneous photometry of the blazar and nearby reference stars ( n - star photometry ) , an inov detection threshold of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> 12 per cent was achieved in the densely sampled differential light curves derived from our data . </S>",
    "<S> we have further expanded the sample by including another 13 tev blazars , taking advantage of the availability in the literature of inov data , including those published earlier in our programme . </S>",
    "<S> the selection criteria for this set of 13 blazars conform to the basic criteria we had adopted for the first set of 9 blazars we have monitored presently . this enlarged , well defined representative sample of 22 tev blazars , monitored on a total of 116 nights ( including 55 nights newly reported here ) , has enabled us to arrive at the first estimate of the inov duty cycle ( dc ) of tev detected blazars . applying the conservative , but commonly employed , @xmath3-test , </S>",
    "<S> the inov dc is found to be 59 per cent , which decreases to 47 per cent if only inov fractional amplitudes ( @xmath4 ) above 3 per cent are considered . </S>",
    "<S> these observations also permit , for the first time , a comparison of the inov characteristics of the two major subclasses of tev detected bl lacs , namely lbls and hbls , for which we find the inov duty cycles to be @xmath2 63 per cent and @xmath2 38 per cent , respectively . </S>",
