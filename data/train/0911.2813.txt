    "recent first - princples calculations suggest that titanium may play a role as an electronically active impurity , promoting the diffusion of hydrogen .",
    "@xcite a number of kinetic experiments have been performed on the above reactions ,  @xcite and these studies are in reasonable agreement with regards to the reported activation energy of desorption .",
    "desorption of hydrogen and decomposition of naalh@xmath0 requires not only mass transport of hydrogen but also of aluminum and/or sodium .",
    "@xcite this process is likely to be mediated by native defects .",
    "lohstroh and fichtner suggested that desorption from naalh@xmath0 is rate - limited by diffusion .",
    "@xcite diffusion of native defects was recently approached by gunaydin _",

    "@xcite here we devote further study to this topic .    in this paper",
    "we investigate structure and stability of native defects in naalh@xmath0 based on first - principles density - functional theory .",
    "for relevant defects , migration enthalpies are also calculated .",
    "these allow us to estimate diffusion activation energies for the various defects that may be responsible for mass transport .",
    "we find that most of the relevant defects exist in charge states other than neutral , and that consideration of these charge states is essential for a proper description of migration and kinetics .",

    "naalh@xmath0 is an insulator with a wide band gap  it is expected that native defects exist in charge states other than neutral .",
    "there exists a clear prescription for calculating the formation energies of charged defects in a manner that accurately describes the thermodynamic reservoirs for atoms and for electrons .",

    "these enthalpies do not include any pressure term from gas - phase h@xmath5  to first approximation this term should drop out of an activation energy measurement . in the following , we therefore focus on activation energies for diffusion that we take to be the sum of calculated formation and migration energies .",

    "@xcite    for calculating defect concentrations , in principle one would have to include the contributions from finite temperature vibrational entropies .",
    "a rigorous treatment of this effect requires an evaluation of the vibrational spectrum for each of the defects .",
    "this would involve an extraordinary computational effort .",
    "nonetheless , it would not lead to a deeper understanding of the effects discussed here , so we consider this task beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "reasonable estimates indicate that such contributions are relatively small , mainly due to cancellation when comparing the vibration entropy of the defect system with the ideal host and reservoir.@xcite in addition , at the temperatures of interest in the present work ( noting that naalh@xmath0 is stable up to 200@xmath34c ) , the @xmath35 term will not make a significant contribution to the free energies of formation .",

    "such a configuration is favorable in the case of a positive charge state ( see the case of @xmath45 ) , but quite high in energy in the case of a negative charge state , due to the fact that an antibonding state resulting from the interaction between the al atoms needs to be occupied in order to accommodate the charge .",

    "creation of @xmath52 would happen at an interface between naalh@xmath0 and na@xmath30alh@xmath31 , resulting in an activation energy of 1.25 + 0.41=1.66 ev .",
    "these values are actually lower bounds , since as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : migration ] the migration barriers used here are only estimates",
    ". however , even these lower bounds are already higher than the observed activation energies for undoped alanate .",
    "@xcite we therefore conclude it is unlikely that neutral @xmath50 or @xmath52 entities would play a dominant role .    as pointed out above , these defects are actually not elementary defects in their own right .",
    "@xmath50 should be regarded as a complex consisting of @xmath1 and h@xmath4 , while @xmath52 is a combination of @xmath2 and @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , based on the structure of naalh@xmath0 it is clear that @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be regarded as the elementary al- and na - transporting entities in this material ; note , e.g. , the persistence of al - h vibrational modes in naalh@xmath0 up to the melting temperature .",
    "@xcite      table  [ tab : sum ] shows that it is too costly for defects containing only al to diffuse .",
    "the estimated activation energies , both for @xmath60 and for al@xmath6 are simply too high . for na - related defects , @xmath2 is clearly important and will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "na@xmath46 , on the other hand , is too costly to form .      in sec .  [",
    "sec : neutr ] we noted that @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be regarded as the elementary defects responsible for al and na transport . note that we do not necessarily need _ both _ to explain the decomposition of naalh@xmath0 ; either defect by itself would suffice to explain formation of na@xmath30alh@xmath31 and al .",
    "the accompanying defects ( h@xmath4 and @xmath45 ) discussed in sec .  [ sec : neutr ] are hydrogen - related defects that provide local charge neutrality and additional hydrogen transport ; however , there is no pressing reason why , out of possible hydrogen - related defects , h@xmath4 should be the only one associated with @xmath1 , or @xmath45 the only one associated with @xmath2 .",
    "the formation energy of the hydrogen - related defects is sensitive to the choice of chemical potentials and the position of the fermi level , and different conditions may favor different defects .",
    "table  [ tab : sum ] shows that among the positively charged defects , @xmath45 is systematically lower in energy than h@xmath46 , and among the negatively charged defects , h@xmath4 is lower in energy than @xmath61 .",
    "however , different fermi - level conditions will favor either positively or negatively charged defects .",
    "it is then important to realize that , from the point of view of transporting hydrogen , h@xmath4 is equivalent to @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , moving a hydrogen interstitial from left to right is equivalent to moving a vacancy from right to left . and given the opposite charge on these defects , local electric fields would indeed tend to push these defects in opposite directions .",
    "we look upon h@xmath4 and @xmath45 as charge - carrying defects that will provide the necessary local charge neutrality . in the absence of electronic charge carriers ( electrons or holes )",
    ", it is these highly mobile hydrogen - related defects that will provide local charge balance in an insulator such as naalh@xmath0 .    unlike the na- or al - related defects",
    ", the hydrogen - related defects can readily form in the interior of the material .",
    "@xmath45 constitute a frenkel pair that can be formed simply by moving a substitutional h atom to an interstitial position .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the al- or na - related defects , which can not form in the bulk but only at an interface , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutr ] .",
    "the hydrogen - related defects are thus unique in their ability to form within the bulk , and given their modest formation energies , we expect a finite concentration of such pairs to always be present .",
    "we suggest here that it is the formation of these hydrogen defect frenkel pairs that may be the rate limiting step for the desorption and decomposition process .",
    "our calculated formation energy for the h@xmath6-@xmath62 pair is 1.10 ev , corresponding to the configuration where the pair creates an alh@xmath63-h - alh@xmath64-h - alh@xmath64 ( or al@xmath64h@xmath65 ) complex .",
    "note that this is lower than the sum of the formation energies of h@xmath4 and @xmath45 listed in table  [ tab : sum ] , the reason being that the proximity of the defects leads to a finite binding energy , which we calculate to be equal to 0.46 ev .",
    "this calculated formation energy would yield an estimate for the activation energy of formation of this pair of 1.10 + 0.16=1.26 ev , where we have added the migration barrier of h@xmath4 to the formation energy as an estimate for the barrier that needs to be overcome .",
    "this activation energy is consistent with the experimentally observed desorption activation energies in undoped naalh@xmath0 .",
    "this suggested mechanism also immediately provides an explanation for the observed effect of ti ( or other transition metals ) , following the arguments in ref .   .",
    "ti acts as an electrically active dopant that shifts the fermi level .",
    "shifts of the fermi level will always lead to a lowering of the formation energy of the hydrogen - related defects .",
    "@xcite for purposes of illustration , consider an upward shift in the fermi level , such as would be introduced by ti .",
    "@xcite figure  [ hdef ] shows that if the magnitude of this shift exceeds a few 0.1 ev , it becomes energetically more favorable for the vacancy to be present in the negative charge state rather than the positive charge state .",
    "the h@xmath4-@xmath61 frenkel pair will then be lower in energy than the h@xmath4-@xmath45 pair . to illustrate the effect of a shift in fermi level , consider the example given in ref .",
    ": an upward shift of 0.44 ev in the fermi level leads to a decrease in the formation energy of @xmath61 by 0.44 ev and an increase in its concentration [ eq .  ( [ eq : conc ] ) ] by 6 orders of magnitude at 100@xmath34c .",
    "we suggest that this energy gain , in the presence of an electrically active impurity that shifts the fermi level , explains the lowering in activation energy for decomposition and desorption .",
    "note that the components of the h@xmath4-@xmath61 pair repel each other , which eliminates any further energy cost in separating them into isolated defects .",
    "we have studied native defects in naalh@xmath0 based on first - principles density functional calculations . despite the wide variety of possible native defects in this material , simplifying principles can be applied to qualitatively understand the relevant defects .",
    "many of the defects can be described as complexes containing the following elementary defects in the system : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and ( h@xmath5)@xmath6 . this does not eliminate the need for performing explicit calculations , since the interactions between constituent defects significantly lower the energy of the complex , e.g. , through relaxation of local strains .",
    "we suggest that this view of native defects will also be useful when studying other alkali or alkaline earth aluminum hydrides .",
    "our results should be of use in interpreting experimental information on desorption from naalh@xmath0 and the effects of dopants such as transition metal impurities on the kinetics . charged ( rather than neutral ) defects play the dominant role in diffusion and decomposition .",
    "we have proposed specific mechanisms for this process ; in particular , we suggest that hydrogen - related frenkel pairs provide the charge carriers that aid in diffusion of al- or na - related defects .",
    "the dependence of their formation energy and , therefore , their concentration on fermi level may explain the observed effects of transition - metal dopants .",
    "moreover , one could engineer the hydrogen desorption kinetics by adding electrically active impurities to shift the fermi level for tuning the concentrations of the defects relevant for hydrogen desorption . the impurities suitable for that purpose do not necessarily need to be transition metals .",
