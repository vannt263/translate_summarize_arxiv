    "thus , ngc  4395  offers the opportunity to explore agn at the lowest end of the mass and luminosity scales .",

    "galaxies show outflows of ionized gas from their nuclei ( crenshaw et  al .",

    "the nature of the variability can provide constraints on the geometry and physical properties of the absorber .",
    "we adopt a modification of the commonly used absorption - line measurement techniques ( see a review by crenshaw , kraemer , & george 2003 ,   2 there ) to measure the absorption - line properties , i.e.  the ionic column - density , the covering factor , and the intrinsic line width .",

    "this allows a more realistic estimate of the possible uncertainties than estimating the observed absorption - line profile using a fit of the unabsorbed spectrum that is based on an interpolated spectral shape . only after estimating the observationally acceptable range of the absorption - line properties , we search for the possible photoionization model solutions .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the results of an effort to confirm the presence of intrinsic uv absorption towards the nucleus of ngc  4395  and determine its properties .",
    "the study is based on _ hst _  stis spectra obtained as part of a reverberation - mapping program on ngc  4395 , which revealed large continuum variability ( by a factor of 47 ) , as well as large changes in the absorption spectrum . the observations and data processing are outlined in   2 .",

    "our conclusions are summarized in ",
    "a complete description of the observations and data reduction is provided in peterson et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and is briefly reviewed here .",
    "ngc  4395  was observed with the _ hst _  space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) using the fuv mama detector with the g140l grating , which covers the spectral range 11501700    at 0.5831    per pixel and a velocity resolution of @xmath14  150250  km  s@xmath1  fwhm .",
    "three sessions of observations took place : the first session , visit 1 , began on 2004 april 10 ; the second session , visit 2 , began on 2004 april 11 ; and a third later session , visit 3 , began on 2004 july 3 ( all dates are ut dates ) .",
    "each visit is composed of five orbits .",
    "the flux density uncertainties are derived using the standard - deviation of the flux density in the ( presumably featureless ) 13401360    continuum window , scaled to other wavelengths assuming photon statistics .",
    "the photometric accuracy of the observation during visit 1 was degraded as a result of a slow drift of the target in the aperture ( peterson et  al .",
    "2005 ) , which did not allow to use these spectra for reverberation mappings .",
    "these spectra are still useful for our purpose of studying the absorption - line profiles , as an accurate photometry is not required .",
    "however , the drift also resulted in a shift of the spectra along the wavelength scale which we had to correct for .",
    "the following procedure was executed to align in wavelength - scale the spectra of the five orbits composing visit 1 .",
    "each spectrum was cross - correlated with the first orbit spectrum using a wavelength - shift ( @xmath15 ) as a free parameter , where we searched for the wavelength - shift which gives the maximum cross - correlation i.e. , @xmath16\\cdot f_i\\left[\\lambda+(\\delta\\lambda)_i\\right]d\\lambda$ ] , where @xmath17 is the flux of the @xmath18-th orbit spectrum , @xmath195 . since the continuum does not contribute to the cross - correlation signal , we integrated only over wavelength regions containing the strong emission features of  @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 and  @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting shifts for orbits 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 were 0.56 , 0.88 , 1.36 , and 1.95 pixels , respectively .",
    "the five orbits were then co - added to form the mean spectrum of visit 1 , and the shift of the mean spectrum was derived by cross - correlating it with the mean spectrum of visit 2 , yielding a wavelength - shift of @xmath23  pixel ( @xmath24   ) .",
    "an eye inspection suggested that the absorption features did not vary during the span of the 5 orbits , for each of the visits . to investigate this quantitatively we calculated the @xmath25 between all orbits and orbit 3 , for each of the visits .",
    "the spectrum of each orbit was first normalized locally in the @xmath26  km  s@xmath1  range of each absorption - line feature ( listed in ",
    "2.2 ) by dividing the local spectrum by the total flux at that range .",
    "each orbit was then compared to orbit 3 by calculating the @xmath27 value for the prominent absorption feature , using the locally - normalized spectra , and then summing over the individual values of @xmath27 .",
    "we used the , , , and absorption lines for all visits , with the addition of in visit 3 .",
    "this procedure yielded @xmath25/degrees of freedom ( dof ) values in the range of 112195/130 for visit 1 , 135210/130 for visit 2 , and 183270/170 for visit 3 .",
    "the @xmath28dof values are thus generally not well above 1 , and since they are most likely affected by some small systematic noise , in addition to the pure statistical noise , we conclude that there is no strong evidence for variability of the absorption - line profiles on an orbit timescale .",
    "we then co - added the spectra of the individual five orbits for each visit , to form the average spectrum of each visit , which we analyze below .",
    "finally , a red - shift of @xmath29 was used to transform the observed wavelength - scale to the rest - frame of ngc  4395 , based on 21  cm line measurements ( haynes et  al .",
    "1998 ; springob et  al .",
    "the spectra were corrected for galactic extinction using @xmath30  mag .  from schlegel ,",
    "finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 , as listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) and the reddening law of seaton ( 1979 ) .",
    "figure 1 [ panels ( a1,a2 ) ] presents the average spectra of the three visits .",
    "ngc  4395  was in a low - flux state during visits 1 and 2 , which we denote by `` low 1 '' and `` low 2 '' , and in a high - flux state during visit 3 , which we denote by `` high '' .",
    "the rest - fame positions of various absorption lines are marked above the spectra .",
    "a possible + absorption blend at 1560    is observed only in the low - state spectra , but as we discuss below this feature may not be real .",
    "a question mark in the low - states near 1524    marks an additional possible absorption feature .",
    "the wavelength range 1207.71221.7    was significantly contaminated by the geocoronal  emission , which increased the count - rate per pixel by a factor of twenty in the raw image data .",
    "although the _ hst _  pipeline reduction is designed to subtract the background geocoronal line contribution , the corrected spectrum fails to show the damped galactic  absorption line , which must be very prominent .",
    "this indicates that the geocoronal contamination was too strong to correct for accurately , and we therefore exclude the 1207.71221.7    region , marked by grayed area in fig .  1",
    ", from further analysis .",
    "the region above @xmath31    was also excluded from the analysis because of the poor continuum s / n of the low - state spectra .",
    "panels ( b1,b2 ) of figure 1 present the low 2/low 1 flux ratio .",
    "broad features are present near the major emission lines , indicating differences in the variability levels of the lines and the continuum",
    ". however , no clear features are present in the ratio plot near the absorption features , indicating that the absorption profiles are not significantly variable on a one day timescale ( the only exception is the + absorption blend , which is not clearly present in the low 1 state ) .",
    "we therefore co - added the low 1 and low 2 spectra , which we denote as the `` low '' state spectrum , and in panels ( c1,c2 ) we show the high / low flux density ratio .",
    "again , prominent features are generally not present near the low - ionization absorption lines of , , , and , suggesting they are not variable .",
    "a very prominent feature is present near the high - ionization line , where the absorption is strong in the high - state , and is absent in the low - state .",
    "note also the large overall continuum increase in the high - state , from a factor of @xmath32 near 1700   , to @xmath33 near 1150   .",
    "panels ( d1,d2 ) show the flux difference between the high- and low - states .",
    "all absorption lines are clearly seen , indicating that the added flux in the high - state went through both the low- and high - ionization ions .",
    "figures 2 and 3 present a close - up of the low- and high - ionization absorption features , respectively . a prominent absorption feature at @xmath0  km  s@xmath1  can be discerned for most of the emission features in figures 2 and 3 , which we denote as systems a@xmath2  and a@xmath3  for the low- and high - ionization absorbers , respectively .",
    "an absorption feature at @xmath4  km  s@xmath1  is seen in the high - state in , which we denote as system b. the measured absorption equivalent width ( ew ) are presented in table 1 ( under @xmath34 , where cf is the covering factor ) , and are typically at a level of 1   , or lower .",
    "we present below a brief review of the technique we use to measure the uv absorption profile , the motivation to use it , and the physical mechanisms incorporated by this technique .",
    "first , we discuss the mechanisms which control the shape of an absorption - line profile as a function of the radial velocity .",
    "this shape is set by a convolution of the natural lorentzian line profile with the thermal velocity distribution , which yields the voigt profile , @xmath35 ( e.g.  rybicki & lightman 1979 , eq .  10.77 there ) .",
    "this profile is then convolved with the bulk radial - velocity distribution of the absorbing ionic column , @xmath36 .",
    "we write @xmath37 , where @xmath38  is the total ionic column - density of the gas and @xmath39 is the normalized distribution of the ionic column - density i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "since the absorption profiles we measure here are generally unresolved , we parameterize @xmath39 as a gaussian .",
    "the convolution of the bulk radial velocity distribution and the thermal one leads to a gaussian velocity distribution , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 . a third mechanism that controls",
    "the shape of the absorption - line profile is the fraction of the illuminating source covered by the absorbing gas at a given radial velocity , @xmath43 .    in a curve - of - growth analysis",
    "the implied @xmath38 for a given absorption ew is a function of @xmath44 . the minimum possible value , @xmath45  km  s@xmath1 , obtained for @xmath46  km  s@xmath1 , leads to an upper limit on @xmath38 .",
    "the other extreme , @xmath47 leads to a lower limit on @xmath38 . in the first case",
    "the intrinsic absorption is generally highly saturated , while in the second it is generally optically thin .",
    "we use a fortran77 subroutine humlik ( wells 1999 ) to calculate the voigt function . the normalized intrinsic absorption profile that includes the effects of the line - of - sight cf and optical depth ( @xmath48 ) equals @xmath49+{\\rm cf}(v)\\cdot e^{-\\tau(v)}.\\label{i}\\ ] ] thus , to model a given intrinsic absorption - line profile one should find four independent parameters : @xmath38 , @xmath44 , cf@xmath50 ( at each velocity segment @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52  the overall velocity - shift of the absorption system relative to the systemic red - shift of the object .",
    "the absorption profiles we detect in ngc  4395  generally appear to be unresolved , or possibly marginally resolved . here",
    "we make some simulations to better understand how the _ hst _  stis instrumental resolution affects lines which are marginally resolved .",
    "the fwhm of the _ hst _  stis line - spread function ( lsf ) is @xmath53  km  s@xmath1 , and one expects that broader lines will not be significantly distorted by the lsf .",
    "however , the stis lsf has a strong narrow core and broad shallow wings , which affect the intrinsic profiles in a non - trivial way .    to get the final predicted absorption - line profile",
    ", one needs to convolve the predicted absorption profile given by eq .  1 with the lsf , i.e.@xmath54 in figure 4 we show simulations of @xmath55 ( right panels ) for a range of input @xmath56 ( left panels ) .",
    "all simulations are with a @xmath44-parameter of 50  km  s@xmath1 . in the upper panels we explore the effect of @xmath38 , ranging from optically thin ( @xmath57  @xmath58 ) to highly saturated ( @xmath59  @xmath58 ) lines , with cf=1 in all cases . in the lower panels we explore the effect of the cf , for cf=0.1 to 1 , for mildly saturated ( @xmath60  @xmath58 ) and highly saturated ( @xmath59  @xmath58 ) lines .",
    "the atomic parameters used for the synthetic absorption line are @xmath61   , @xmath62  s@xmath1 , and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the spontaneous radiative transition probability , and @xmath65 is the oscillator strength .",
    "the chosen values are typical for the uv absorption lines analyzed in this paper .",
    "the stis lsfs are plotted in panel ( b ) , as tabulated at the nasa / stsci _ hst _  stis database .",
    "the upper panels of fig .  4 demonstrate that saturated lines will generally appear unsaturated , even when @xmath56 is significantly broader than lsf@xmath50 .",
    "for example , the @xmath66  @xmath58  case , where @xmath67 within 200  km  s@xmath1  of the line center in @xmath56 [ panel ( a ) ] , appears as a @xmath68 , fwhm=1000  km  s@xmath1 , absorption profile in @xmath55 [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "this strong distortion results from the extended broad wings of the lsf , which bring in unabsorbed continuum flux to the highly saturated line core .",
    "even the highly saturated absorption at @xmath59  @xmath58  [ panel ( a ) ] , where the intrinsic fwhm=1000  km  s@xmath1  ( five times the lsf ) , appears unsaturated following a convolution with the lsf [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "the lower panels of fig .  4 show cases where the intrinsic profiles appear unsaturated due to partial coverage .",
    "comparison of panels ( b ) and ( d ) shows that it is practically impossible to differentiate a range of @xmath38  at a given cf , from a range of cf at a given @xmath38 .",
    "below we therefore adopt two extreme approaches for modeling the absorption - line profiles :    1 .",
    "assume @xmath69  km  s@xmath1 , which corresponds to cold gas with @xmath70  k producing the minimal possible velocity dispersion .",
    "this assumption leads to the highest possible @xmath38 , where the absorption is dominated by the lorentzian wings . we can not measure the value of @xmath44 because it is well below the spectral resolution .",
    "assume absorbing gas that has the maximum possible @xmath71 consistent with the observed absorption - line profiles .",
    "this assumption allows an optically thin absorber , and leads to the lowest possible @xmath38 .",
    "since the observed absorption - line profiles are dominated by the instrumental lsf , we can not resolve any velocity dependence of cf@xmath50 , and we therefore use a velocity - independent cf while reconstructing the spectra .",
    "although much higher resolution spectra ( @xmath72  km  s@xmath1 ) obtained with the stis echelle , are presented by crenshaw et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the low s / n of these spectra does not allow significant constraints on the absorption width .      the common technique for measuring @xmath55 is by interpolating the unabsorbed spectrum between the two nearest unabsorbed points , where @xmath55 is then calculated by dividing the measured absorbed spectrum by the fitted unabsorbed spectrum .",
    "this method may be rather uncertain when the absorption occurs in regions affected by emission lines , as the unabsorbed spectrum is difficult to estimate due to the possible presence of emission features whose shape is not well constrained . to avoid the possible significant systematic errors in @xmath55 we adopt a reverse approach of spectral `` reconstruction '' .",
    "we calculate @xmath55 based on a certain model for the absorber , divide the observed spectrum by @xmath55 , and get the reconstructed unabsorbed spectrum .",
    "the parameter models are deemed acceptable if the reconstructed spectrum appears `` acceptable '' .",
    "this method is formally not more accurate than the standard approach , where @xmath55 is directly measured , however it should allow a larger range of reconstructed spectral shapes , and thus a more realistic estimate of the possible uncertainty in the fit parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the adopted approach also allows to estimate the true range of @xmath38 , without introducing a theoretical bias , because @xmath55 is produced using atomic physics only , without assuming a specific photoionization model or particular elemental abundances .",
    "since the absorption - line features appear to be generally unresolved , we attempt only to constrain the range of possible values for @xmath38  and cf .",
    "we assume a set of cf and @xmath44 , and then reconstruct the observed absorption - line profiles by varying @xmath38  only ( the algorithms are described below ) .",
    "the assumed sets of cf and @xmath44 are :    @xmath34 : :    constrain the column - density for a full coverage absorber .",
    "+    * measure the lower - limit of @xmath38  assuming    @xmath73  km  s@xmath1   we iterate over    different values of @xmath44 , while reconstructing    simultaneously the most prominent absorption - lines in our spectra :    @xmath74 ,  @xmath75 and    @xmath76 , using the same column - density for both    lines .",

    "thus , the results are identical    to the above case for @xmath34 .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "apparent changes in the absorption strength are commonly interpreted as changes in the absorbing medium ( e.g.  `` moving clouds '' ) . however , as we have shown here , such changes may also result from changes in the illumination pattern behind a fixed absorber . if the absorber lies behind some radiation sources ( the nlr here ) , and in front of others ( the blr plus continuum here ) , then large changes in the relative strength of the absorbed versus unabsorbed sources can produce large changes in the absorption features , even when the absorber is not variable .",
    "the study of the uv absorption line variability in objects showing large continuum variations can thus provide new constraints on the location of the absorber , and thus break the large degeneracy in the absorber distance determination based on single epoch spectra .",

    "<S> a high / absorption ratio is expected for a high metallicity absorber , but this is excluded here as the metallicity of the host galaxy and of the nuclear gas is significantly subsolar . a simple acceptable model for systems a@xmath3  and b is an absorber located between the broad line region ( blr ) and the nlr , which absorbs only the continuum and the blr . at the low - state the strong narrow emission lines of and dominate the spectrum , making the absorption invisible . at the high - state the absorbed continuum and blr emission </S>",
