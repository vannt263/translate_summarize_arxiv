    "it has been known for a long time that certain magnetic materials ( e.g. @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) exhibit spatially nonuniform ordering with a long - wavelength helical structure .",
    "this phenomenon was first explained by dzyaloshinsky @xcite and moriya @xcite fifty years ago .",
    "they pointed out that the lack of inversion symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice allows a new term in the ginzburg  landau free energy functional ( hereafter referred to as the dm term ) , which makes the uniform ferromagnetic ground state unstable with respect to the formation of the helical spin density wave . a similar effect",
    "also occurs in antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "microscopically , the dm term results from the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the theory of helical magnetism was developed to its present form two decades after the original discovery @xcite , and is still a subject of intensive research in the condensed - matter - physics community @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we show that this phenomenon has an analogy in a vastly different branch of physics , namely in strongly - interacting cold dense quark matter , which exhibits color superconductivity ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the necessary ingredients for the helical ordering to take place are a vector ( spin ) order parameter and lack of space - inversion symmetry .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on spin - one color superconductivity .",
    "we will show that in this case , the parity - violating dm term is induced by weak interactions .    due to the exchange of gluons ,",
    "the quark cooper pairs are formed predominantly in the spin - zero color - antitriplet channel . at very high baryon density where the quark masses can be neglected ,",
    "the cold three - flavor quark matter is known to be in the so - called color - flavor - locked phase . however , at densities corresponding to the neutron star cores the large value of the strange quark mass as well as the charge neutrality constraint induce a mismatch of the fermi levels of different quark flavors , and thus impose stress on the cross - flavor pairing .",
    "other forms of pairing are then likely to occur .",
    "depending on the size of the fermi surface mismatch , quarks of two flavors and two colors may combine in the so - called 2sc phase .",
    "when the mismatch is too large , only quarks of the same flavor can pair and the spin - one pairing then remains the only possibility @xcite .    originally spin - one color superconductivity was suggested and studied as a mechanism for pairing of quarks of a single flavor @xcite , or a single color @xcite , left over from the 2sc pairing .",
    "the classification and physical properties of several spin - one color - superconducting phases were worked out in a series of papers by schmitt _",
    "possible impacts of spin - one color superconductivity on the phenomenology of compact stars were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . a different approach to spin - one color superconductivity , based on the schwinger ",
    "dyson equations , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the weak - coupling quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations at asymptotically high density show that the ground state of the single - flavor quark matter is the color - spin - locked ( csl ) phase .",
    "however , when spin - one color superconductivity is considered within three - flavor quark matter ( e.g. as a complement to the primary 2sc pairing ) , the requirement of overall color neutrality may favor other patterns of spin - one pairing @xcite .",
    "we will therefore in the main body of this paper perform a phenomenological analysis based on the ginzburg ",
    "landau ( gl ) theory , treating the coefficients in the free energy as unknown parameters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ sec : classification ] by investigating the possible forms that the order parameter in a single - flavor spin - one color superconductor may take .",
    "such a classification was already done by schmitt @xcite for the sake of weak - coupling qcd calculations . however , while in qcd the order parameter is provided by a nontrivial function of momentum near the fermi surface  the gap function , in the gl description we deal with a single ( local ) order parameter .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis , allowing us to carry out a complete classification of the possible symmetry - breaking patterns .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : gl_without_dm ] we review the gl theory for spin - one color superconductivity without the parity - violating dm term .",
    "this was already developed by bailin and love more than twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they restricted their attention to the so - called inert states , proposing that one with the lowest free energy for the ground state . here",
    "we derive a set of inequalities between the independent quartic terms in the gl functional which allow us to determine the unique absolute minimum of the free energy .",
    "we thus show that there is a sector in the phase diagram where the true ground state is actually noninert .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : gl_with_dm ] we finally introduce the parity - violating dm term into the gl free energy functional . based on ref .",
    "@xcite we first work out the ( slightly generalized ) theory of the helical spin density wave in the ferromagnets .",
    "with all the necessary formalism ready , we then construct the corresponding helical states for the spin - one color - superconducting phases , and determine the modified phase diagram .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : microderivation ] we demonstrate how the dm term arises from weak - interaction physics .",
    "we estimate the corresponding coefficient in the weak - coupling limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomenology ] we then discuss the possible relevance of this effect for the phenomenology of dense quark matter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "it should be noted that while some calculations such as the derivation of the ginzburg  landau free energy in the high - density , weak - coupling approximation are standard and the details may thus certainly be omitted , the algebraic analysis presented in sections [ sec : classification ] , [ sec : gl_without_dm ] , and [ sec : gl_with_dm ] is particular to spin - one color superconductivity .",
    "even though all derivations are based on elementary linear algebra and require no lengthy computations , we choose to provide most details since they can not be found elsewhere .",
    "for reader s convenience , we formulate some purely mathematical auxiliary material in the form of simple theorems and defer the full proofs to the appendices .",
    "in this section we will investigate the possible symmetry - breaking patterns in a single - flavor spin - one color superconductor .",
    "the order parameter transforms as an antitriplet under @xmath2 color transformations , as a vector under spatial @xmath3 rotations , and carries charge of the baryon number @xmath4 group .",
    "it can be represented by a complex @xmath5 matrix , @xmath6 , which transforms as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the indices l and r denote the `` left '' and `` right '' symmetry groups , acting on the order parameter .",
    "this symmetry structure is similar to that of the superfluid helium @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , since the symmetry group of the spin - one color superconductors is larger than that of the superfluid helium [ which has another @xmath3 instead of the @xmath2 ] , the classification will be somewhat simpler in the present case .",
    "in the following it will be helpful to consider also transformations from the `` diagonal '' subgroup , @xmath12 , @xmath13 the classification of the possible inequivalent forms of the order parameter will be based on the following two claims which are proved in appendix [ app : op ] .",
    "[ thm : order_parameter ] by a suitable symmetry transformation , the order parameter can always be brought in the form , @xmath14 ( with real parameters @xmath15 ) , being a hermitian , positive - semidefinite matrix .",
    "[ thm : sep_invar ] let the order parameter have the form and @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath18 if and only if @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    ". represents the simplest form to which the order parameter can in general be cast . as could have been expected , it contains six independent parameters : a complex @xmath5 matrix has altogether @xmath21 real parameters , @xmath22 of which can be fixed by a transformation from the @xmath22-parametric symmetry group , @xmath23 .",
    "we will classify all special forms of the order parameter which leave some _ continuous _ subgroup of @xmath24 unbroken .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified by theorem [ thm : sep_invar ] which ensures that one can separately investigate invariance under left unitary transformations from @xmath25 , and diagonal orthogonal rotations from @xmath12 .",
    "[ the transformed order parameter can always be written as on the left - hand side of eq . by the substitution @xmath26 , which is just another matrix from @xmath25 .",
    "] there is no nontrivial unbroken combination of transformations from the two groups .",
    "therefore , we just need to classify the unbroken subgroups of @xmath25 and @xmath12 .",
    "as follows from the polar decomposition , theorem [ thm : polar_decomp ] , given in appendix [ app : op ] , @xmath25 has a nontrivial unbroken subgroup if and only if the matrix @xmath27 has zero modes .",
    "specifically , the unbroken subgroup will be @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of zero modes of @xmath27 .",
    "the possible unbroken subgroups of @xmath12 may be found by elementary geometry .",
    "the hermitian order parameter @xmath27 is written as a sum of its real symmetric and imaginary antisymmetric parts , @xmath30 .",
    "these obviously transform separately under the diagonal subgroup @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the antisymmetric part is parameterized as @xmath31 so that the three components @xmath32 transform as a vector , @xmath33 .",
    "the ( real ) symmetric matrix @xmath34 may be viewed as defining a quadratic surface with principal values @xmath35 . apparently , it possesses the same symmetry as @xmath36 if and only if this quadratic surface is axially symmetric , with the axis given by @xmath33 .",
    "this constrains @xmath34 to be of the form @xmath37 or equivalently a linear combination of identity and the projector to the plane perpendicular to @xmath33 , @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath34 is actually diagonal , obviously at most one component of @xmath33 may be nonzero ( or @xmath39 ) in order to preserve a continuous subgroup of @xmath12 .    by combining the conditions for invariance under the left unitary and the diagonal orthogonal transformations ,",
    "one arrives at the classification summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : classification ] .",
    "the logic of the table is simple .",
    "first four rows display phases with nonzero @xmath33 in order of increasing unbroken symmetry .",
    "the next two rows show the csl and polar phases , whose order parameter is diagonal",
    ". then come the phases @xmath40 that completely break the @xmath12 .",
    "these can not be easily cast in the form and we thus display them in such a way as to manifest the number of zero modes . finally ,",
    "the axial and planar states , showed under the double line , are just special cases of the oblate and cylindrical ones , already included in the table .",
    "they are distinguished by an unbroken discrete symmetry , generated by the permutation matrix @xmath41 that is , a rotation by @xmath42 about the line @xmath43 .",
    "we do not have the ambition to extend the above analysis to unbroken _ discrete _ symmetries .",
    "these two special cases are mentioned explicitly because they will later turn out to occupy a part of the phase diagram .",
    "four of the indicated phases are `` inert '' , i.e. , their order parameter is fixed up to a symmetry transformation and an overall normalization .",
    "these are the a , csl , planar , and polar phases .",
    "note that some of the states that are distinct according to ref .",
    "@xcite , are classified as equivalent here .",
    "this is because ( as already remarked above ) we treat the matrix elements of @xmath27 as pure numbers , not functions of momentum .",
    "a remark about the nomenclature is in order here .",
    "the names of the four inert phases are standard in literature on spin - one color superconductivity .",
    "the terms `` oblate '' @xcite and `` @xmath44 '' @xcite have been taken over from literature on superfluid helium 3 .",
    "the remaining four names are new .",
    "the `` n '' states are labeled by the degeneracy of the zero eigenvalue of @xmath27 . in the `` cylindrical '' phase ,",
    "the quadratic form @xmath34 defines a cylinder with the vector @xmath33 pointing along its axis .",
    "finally , the `` axial '' state may be thought of as deformed csl with just axial symmetry .",
    "as we will see in sec .",

    "we will assume that it is negative ( i.e. , we are in the superfluid phase ) so that the free energy has a nontrivial minimum .",
    "we will use the invariant @xmath46 to measure the size of the condensate ; actually , it is a squared norm of @xmath27 in the sense that will be specified later .",

    "second , even if we somehow managed to solve it , we could at best show that the solution is a local minimum of the free energy .",
    "instead , we derive a set of inequalities between the invariants @xmath49 that allow us to uniquely determine the absolute minimum of the free energy .",
    "we again formulate these inequalities as simple theorems whose proof is given in detail in appendix [ app : inequalities ] .",
    "( it is understood that all the following claims about the order parameter hold up to a symmetry transformation . )",

    "we do so by finding a lower bound on the free energy and showing that this bound is saturated by a particular type of the order parameter . in all cases ,",
    "the free energy density can be , after fixing the orientation of the condensate , written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an effective quartic coupling , specific for the given phase . the ground state condensate and free energy",

    "the calculation of the ground state for different relative values of @xmath48 given in the previous subsection is straightforward , but may not be entirely transparent .",
    "therefore , we complement it here by an elegant and powerful geometric picture , first developed by kim and frautschi @xcite to analyze complicated higgs potentials in models of grand unification",
    ". it will not only confirm our previous conclusions about the ground state , but also illuminate the nature of the inert and noninert states and the phase transitions between them .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "the quartic part of the free energy can be thought of as depending on the squared norm of the condensate , @xmath46 , and two dimensionless quantities , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "the shape of the target space is a property of the algebra of @xmath5 matrices ( and the symmetry group @xmath24 ) , and is independent of the couplings @xmath48 .",
    "the absolute minimum of the free energy can now be found by a consecutive minimization with respect to the `` angles '' @xmath84 , and then the `` modulus '' @xmath86 .",
    "but since the free energy is linear in @xmath84 , the minimum will simply lie somewhere on the boundary of the target space .",

    "[ fig : kim_plot ] .",
    "we emphasize once again that it is the points at its boundary that will appear in the phase diagram as ground states for some particular combination of @xmath48 . the states that correspond to the corners of the target space",

    "these are the three inert states , a , csl , and polar .",
    "since they are inert , they are represented by a single point in the target space .",
    "a noninert state of a particular type will occupy some nontrivial domain , depending on its number of free parameters .",

    "the second inequality in eq . defines the edge connecting the `` a '' and `` polar '' corners , which thus involves all rank - one order parameters . the polar ",

    "ferrell state considered in crystalline color superconductors @xcite .",
    "different is , of course , the mechanism of the inhomogeneous pairing : in crystalline color superconductors , it is driven by a mismatch of the fermi surfaces of the quarks to be paired , whereas in the present case the fermi momenta are exactly equal .",
    "the nonzero momentum of the pair is induced by the dm term .",
    "the important difference between the various phases considered here is that unlike the real axial , planar , and polar states , the single - plane - wave states a and @xmath44 carry nonzero ( charge as well as color ) current .",
    "while in crystalline superconductors this is balanced by a backflow of the unpaired fermions so that the total net current in the ground state is zero @xcite , the same issue in the a and @xmath44 helical phases yet remains to be clarified .",
    "we observe that the axial and planar states which in a sense interpolate between the csl and polar phases , show up as physical ground states in the phase diagram .",
    "this suggests that they should be seriously taken into consideration even in the absence of the dm term . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of color neutrality on spin - one color superconductivity as a complement to the primary 2sc pairing was studied .",
    "it was shown that the polar phase may be energetically preferred .",
    "our results open the possibility of an even more favorable state of the axial type , which can compensate the color imbalance of the 2sc pairing and yet gain energy from condensation of all three anticolors .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the helical ordering by the dm interaction is a fairly general phenomenon ; the only two prerequisites are a vector order parameter and broken parity .",
    "there are several issues that deserve further investigation . besides the stress on the spin - one color superconductivity which stems from the pairing of the other quark flavors",
    ", we would like to point out in particular the peculiar properties of collective excitations .",
    "they will be anisotropic even in the csl - like axial state and may thus in principle provide a clear manifestation of the nonuniform nature of the ground state .",

    "i am indebted to a. schmitt for sharing with me his insight in spin - one color superconductivity and for numerous improving remarks and suggestions .",

    "in this appendix we prove theorems [ thm : order_parameter ] and [ thm : sep_invar ] . the basic ingredient will be the polar decomposition , well known from linear algebra .",
    "[ thm : polar_decomp ] let @xmath244 be a square complex matrix .",
    "there is a unitary matrix @xmath245 and a positive - semidefinite hermitian matrix @xmath246 such that @xmath247 the matrix @xmath246 is unique , while the matrix @xmath245 is unique if and only if @xmath244 is nonsingular .",
    "we will not prove this statement here but just remark that when @xmath244 is singular , the matrix @xmath245 is determined up to a unitary transformation acting on the eigenvectors of @xmath244 with zero eigenvalue .      thanks to the polar decomposition , we can always make the order parameter @xmath27 hermitian and positive - semidefinite by a suitable left unitary transformation .",
    "we thus have @xmath30 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath36 ) is a real ( anti)symmetric matrix . as the next and last step",
    "we note that a diagonal orthogonal rotation preserves ( anti)symmetry , and thus transforms the matrices @xmath248 separately .",
    "the real symmetric matrix @xmath34 can always be diagonalized by such a transformation , which brings the order parameter to the form .",
    "the diagonal orthogonal transformation preserves hermiticity and the spectrum , hence eq . says @xmath249 , where @xmath250 and both @xmath27 and @xmath251 are hermitian and positive - semidefinite .",
    "however , theorem [ thm : polar_decomp ] asserts that the hermitian part of the polar decomposition is unique .",
    "therefore , we necessarily find @xmath252 and @xmath19 , as was to be proved .",
    "in this appendix we prove theorems [ thm : veta1 ] , [ thm : veta2 ] , [ thm : veta3 ] , and [ thm : veta5 ] .",
    "several proofs will be based on the well known cauchy inequality which asserts that for any two complex vectors @xmath253 , we have @xmath254 the inequality in eq .",
    "is saturated if and only if the vectors @xmath253 are collinear .",
    "let us denote the ( real and positive ) eigenvalues of @xmath255 as @xmath256",

    "for the first inequality , set @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",

    "this inequality is saturated when all the eigenvalues @xmath256 are equal , that is , @xmath255 is proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "the order parameter @xmath27 is then unitary up to a real scale factor and can be brought to the csl form by a left unitary transformation .      using the complex - vector notation ,",
    "so that we obviously have @xmath263 with the equality when all scalar products @xmath264 are zero . writing @xmath141 in terms of its real and imaginary parts , this first of all requires @xmath265 and @xmath266 for all rows @xmath141 of the matrix @xmath27 .",
    "one of the vectors , say @xmath267 , can then be cast into a special form by a right orthogonal rotation , so that the order parameter becomes @xmath268 let us assume that @xmath269 ( if not , we go on processing the second row in the same manner ) .",
    "the orthogonality , @xmath270 , then implies @xmath271 , and from @xmath272 , @xmath273 follows .",
    "the vectors @xmath267 and @xmath274 are therefore collinear so that @xmath267 can be made zero by a suitable left unitary transformation .",
    "proceeding in the same manner , we next nullify @xmath274 and end up with just the third row of @xmath27 , being proportional to @xmath275 .",

    "therefore , we get @xmath280 we thus prove @xmath281 with the equality if and only if @xmath282 .",
    "this translates into the requirement that @xmath283 is real , i.e. , all scalar products of columns of @xmath27 must be real",
    ". however , the order parameter may always be transformed by a left unitary matrix to the form @xmath284 with real @xmath32 and complex @xmath285 . applying step by step the above reality requirement we find that the whole matrix actually has to be real .",
    "as already mentioned in appendix [ app_sub : proof_veta2 ] , we can define a scalar product of two hermitian matrices by the trace of their matrix product .",
    "we now introduce some further notation .",
    "we first define an orthonormal basis , @xmath286 , so that @xmath287 .",
    "these matrices are simply defined as @xmath288 and @xmath289 , in terms of the standard gell - mann matrices . expanding",
    "a given hermitian matrix in this basis , e.g. @xmath290 , the scalar product becomes @xmath291 .    as above",
    "we denote @xmath277 . recalling that the basis matrices @xmath292 are imaginary while all others are real",
    ", we can see that the complex conjugation in @xmath293 just changes the sign of the coordinates @xmath294 .",

    "after substitution for the order parameter from , it is straightforward to show that this is equivalent to the condition stated in theorem [ thm : veta3 ] .",
    "this inequality is most tricky because it does not hold for all matrices @xmath27 but just for those satisfying @xmath55 .",
    "we will need another auxiliary claim .",
    "[ thm : vwaux ] every hermitian positive - semidefinite matrix @xmath195 satisfies the following inequality , @xmath300 where the non - negative quantities @xmath301 are defined by eq . .",

    "the expectation value of @xmath195 is @xmath310 positive - semidefiniteness requires that this be non - negative , which leads to @xmath311 the inequality is thus proved . in order for it to be saturated",
    ", we must have @xmath312 , i.e. , @xmath313 , and @xmath314 . the matrix @xmath195 then reads @xmath315 , which has the @xmath44 form with @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "we now get to the proof of theorem [ thm : veta5 ] . for @xmath74",
    "we find using theorem [ thm : veta3 ] , @xmath318 whence @xmath319 .",
    "this means that the right - hand side of the inequality is non - negative , and the inequality can be equivalently squared .",
    "this yields @xmath320 the saturation condition is the same as that for the inequality . since",
    "the order parameter @xmath27 is hermitian and positive - semidefinite without lack of generality , it is given by the unique square root of @xmath277 .",
