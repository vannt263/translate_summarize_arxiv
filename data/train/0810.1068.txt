    "the study of very high energy ( vhe , @xmath1 gev ) @xmath0-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is one of the major goals of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "the sensitivity of the current imaging air cerenkov telescopes ( iact ) enables studies of the blazar phenomenon , and in particular advances in understanding both the origin of the vhe @xmath0-rays as well as the relations between photons of different energies ( from radio to vhe ) .    except for the radio galaxy m87 , all 23 currently known vhe @xmath0-ray emitting agns @xcite are high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects @xcite , rwagner / sources/ for an up - to - date source list . ] a subclass of blazars characterized by a low high - energy luminosity when compared with quasars , and a synchrotron peak in the x - ray band .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is characterized by a second peak at very high @xmath0-ray energies . in synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc )",
    "models it is assumed that the observed @xmath0-ray peak is due to the inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from the accelerated electrons up - scattering previously produced synchrotron photons to high energies @xcite . in hadronic models , instead , interactions of a highly relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter , proton - induced cascades , or synchrotron radiation off protons , are responsible for the high - energy photons .",
    "another defining property of blazars is the high variability of their emission ranging from radio to @xmath0-rays . for vhe",
    "@xmath0-ray blazars , correlations between x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission have been found on time scales ranging from @xmath2 minutes to days and months ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although the correlations have proven to be rather complicated @xcite .",
    "here we present selected results on multi - wavelength campaigns with magic participation and for magic blazar observations of mkn  501 , m87 ( february 2008 ) , 1es1011 + 496 , s50716 + 71 , and 3c279 .",
    "magic @xcite , located on the canary island of la palma ( 2200  m a.s.l . ) , is currently the largest ( 17-m ) single - dish iact .",
    "its energy range spans from 5060  gev ( trigger threshold at small zenith angles ) up to tens of tev .",
    "magic has a sensitivity of @xmath3  1.6% of the crab nebula flux in 50 observing hours .",
    "its energy resolution is about 30% above 100 gev and about 25% from 200 gev onwards .",
    "the magic standard analysis chain is described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "observations during moderate moonshine enable a substantially extended duty cycle @xcite , which is particularly important for blazar observations .",
    "parallel optical @xmath4-band observations are performed by the tuorla blazar monitoring program and its kva 35-cm telescope .",
    "a second magic telescope is being commissioned . by stereoscopic observations ,",
    "the sensitivity of the two - telescope observatory will be further increased considerably .",
    "m87 is the only non - blazar radio galaxy known to emit vhe @xmath0-rays , and one of the best - studied extragalactic black - hole systems . to enable long - term studies and assess the variability timescales and the location of the vhe emission in m87 , the h.e.s.s . ,",
    "veritas , and magic collaborations established a regular , shared monitoring of m87 and agreed on mutual alerts in case of a significant detection @xcite .",
    "results from the entire monitoring campaign will appear in a separate paper . during the magic observations ,",
    "a strong signal of @xmath5 significance was found on 2008 february 1 , triggering the other iacts as well as _ swift",
    "_ observations . for the first time",
    ", we assessed the energy spectrum below 250 gev @xcite , which can be described by a power law with a spectral index of @xmath6 .",
    "this relatively hard vhe spectrum is unique among the extragalactic vhe @xmath0-ray sources , which show either curved or softer spectra .",
    "we did not measure a high - energy cut - off , but found a marginal spectral hardening , which may be interpreted as a similarity to other blazars detected at vhe , where such hardening has often been observed @xcite .",
    "our analysis revealed a variable ( significance : 5.6@xmath7 ) night - to - night @xmath0-ray flux above 350 gev , while no variability was found in the 150350 gev range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m87 ] ) .",
    "we confirm the @xmath8 short - time variability of m87 reported by @xcite .",
    "this fastest variability @xmath9 observed so far in tev @xmath0-rays in m87 is on the order of or even below one day , restricting the emission region to a size of @xmath10 schwarzschild radii ( doppler factor @xmath11 ) , and suggests the core of m87 rather than the brightest known knot in the m87 jet , hst-1 , as the origin of the tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "there exists no lower limit on the size of hst-1 , and thus the flux variability can not fully dismiss hst-1 as possible origin of the tev flux . during the magic observations ,",
    "however , hst-1 was at a historically low x - ray flux level , whereas at the same time the luminosity of the m87 core was at a historical maximum ( d. harris , priv . comm . ) .",
    "this strongly supports the core of m87 as the vhe @xmath0-ray emission region .",
    "mkn 501 ( @xmath12 ) is known to be a strong and variable vhe @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "magic observed mkn  501 for 24 nights during six weeks in summer 2005 @xcite . in two of these ( one with moon present ) , the recorded flux exceeded four times the crab - nebula flux , and revealed rapid flux changes with doubling times as short as 3 minutes or less .",
    "for the first time , short ( @xmath13  20 min ) vhe @xmath0-ray flares with a resolved time structure could be used for detailed studies of particle acceleration and cooling timescales .",
    "interestingly the flares in the two nights behaved differently : while the 2005 june 30 flare is only visible in 250gev1.2tev , the 2005 july 9 flare is apparent in all energy bands ( 120  gev to beyond 1.2  tev ) .",
    "additionally , under some assumptions a time delay between the flare peak in different energy bins ( @xmath14  tev and @xmath15  tev ) in the latter flare was determined to be @xmath16  minutes @xcite .",
    "while this comparatively high value may be explained by the crude binned analysis , the indicated error is clearly underestimated .",
    "the reanalysis of these data in @xcite resulted in a much - improved estimate for the time - energy relation .",
    "at a zero - delay probability of @xmath17 , a marginal time delay of @xmath18 towards higher energies was found using two independent analyses , both exploiting the full statistical power of the dataset ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "several explanations for this delay have been considered up to now :    1 .",
    "particles inside the emission region moving with constant doppler factor need some time to be accelerated to energies that enable them to produce @xmath0 rays with specific energies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission has been captured in the initial acceleration phase of the relativistic blob in the jet , which at any point in time radiates up to highest @xmath0-ray energies possible @xcite .",
    "3 .   an one - zone ssc model , which invokes a brief episode of increased particle injection at low energies @xcite .",
    "4 .   an energy - dependent speed of photons in vacuum @xcite , as predicted in some models of quantum gravity @xcite . when assuming a simultaneous emission of the @xmath0-rays ( of different energies ) at the source , a lower limit of @xmath19  gev ( 95% c.l . ) can be established @xcite , which increases further if any delay towards higher energies in the source is present .",
    "magic has been performing target of opportunity observations upon high optical states of known or potential vhe blazars . up to now , this strategy has proven very successful with the detection of mkn 180 , 1es 1011 + 496 , and recently s50716 + 71 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the 18.7-h observation of 1es 1011 + 496 was triggered by an optical outburst in march 2007 , resulting in a 6.2-@xmath7 detection at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "an indication for an optical  vhe correlation is given , in that in spring 2007 the vhe @xmath0-ray flux is > 40% higher than in spring 2006 , where magic observed the blazar as part of a systematic search for vhe emission from a sample of x - ray bright ( @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 ) northern hbls at moderate ( @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 ) redshifts @xcite .    in april 2008 ,",
    "kva observed a high optical state of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 , triggering magic observation , which resulted in a the detection of a strong 6.8-@xmath7 signal , corresponding to a flux of @xmath27 .",
    "the magic observation time was 2.6h .",
    "the source was also in a high x - ray state @xcite .",
    "the determination of the before - unknown redshifts of 1es1011 + 496 ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) and s50716 + 71 ( @xmath29 , @xcite ) makes these objects the third - most and second - most distant tev blazars after 3c279 , respectively .",
    "for an advanced understanding of blazars , coordinated simultaneous multi - frequency observations are essential , yielding seds spanning over 15 orders of magnitude .",
    "magic participated in a number of multiwavelength - campaigns carried out on five northern - hemisphere blazars , which involved the x - ray instruments _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ , the @xmath0-ray telescope h.e.s.s . and magic , and other optical and radio telescopes .",
    "* mkn421 was detected in a campaign april 2006 in all wavelengths ( publication under preparation ) , * the observations of mkn501 in july 2006 revealed the lowest x - ray and vhe state ever observed .",
    "no variability in vhe @xmath0-rays was found , while an overall increase of about 50% during one day was seen in x - rays .",
    "a one - zone ssc model describes this quiescent state of mkn501 well @xcite . * also campaigns on 1es1218 + 304 and 1h1426 + 428",
    "have been carried out , during both of which significant x - ray variability has been observed .",
    "the vhe data are being analyzed . *",
    "the vhe emission of pg1553 + 113 showed no variability during the first multi - wavelength campaign on this blazar in july 2006 @xcite .",
    "* 1es1959 + 650 showed vhe data among the lowest flux state observed from this object , while at the same time a relatively high optical and x - ray flux ( both swift / suzaku ) was found @xcite .",
    "the sed could be modeled using similar parameters as needed for the sed measured in 2002 , with a slightly more compact source and a slightly lower magnetic field .",
    "further campaigns have been organized .",
    "observations of 3c  279 , the brightest egret agn @xcite , during the webt multi - wavelength campaign @xcite revealed a 5.77-@xmath7 post - trial detection on 2006 february 23 supported by a marginal signal on the preceding night @xcite .",
    "the overall probability for a zero - flux lightcurve can be rejected on the 5.04-@xmath7 level .",
    "simultaneous optical @xmath4-band observations , by the tuorla observatory blazar monitoring program revealed that during the magic observations , the @xmath0-ray source was in a generally high optical state , a factor of 2 above the long - term baseline flux , but with no indication of short time - scale variability at visible wavelengths .",
    "the observed vhe spectrum can be described by a power law with a differential photon spectral index of @xmath30 between 75 and 500 gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig:279 ] ) .",
    "the measured integrated flux above 100  gev on 23  february is @xmath31 photons @xmath32 s@xmath33 .    located at @xmath34 , vhe observations of such distant sources were until recently impossible due to the expected strong attenuation of @xmath0 rays by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ; see @xcite for a review ) , which influences the observed spectrum and flux , resulting in an exponential decrease with energy and a cutoff in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the observed vhe spectrum is sensitive to the ebl between @xmath35 .",
    "the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum is difficult to reconcile with models predicting high ebl densities ( e.g. , the fast - evolution model of @xcite ) , while low - level models , e.g. @xcite , are still viable . assuming a maximum intrinsic photon index of @xmath36 , an upper ebl limit is inferred , leaving a small allowed region for the ebl .    the results support , at higher redshift , the conclusion drawn from earlier measurements @xcite that the observations of the _ hubble space telescope _ and _ spitzer _ correctly estimate most of the light sources in the universe .",
    "the derived limits are consistent with the ebl evolution corresponding to a maximum star - formation rate at @xmath37 , as suggested by @xcite and similar models .",
