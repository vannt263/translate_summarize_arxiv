    "the object sdssp j083643.85 + 005453.3 ( hereafter : sdss 0836 + 0054 ) is the highest redshift radio - detected quasar known to date ( @xmath0 ) discovered using multicolor imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the object is one of the seven @xmath2 quasars known .",
    "six of them form a complete colour - selected flux - limited sample from an area of 2870  deg@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the quasar sdss 0836 + 0054 was identified with an unresolved radio source within @xmath4 in the vla first survey @xcite , where the source total flux density was @xmath5  mjy at 1.4  ghz ( 21  cm wavelength ) . the total flux density in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was @xmath6  mjy at the same frequency .    according to the recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , @xmath7 is close to the reionization epoch of the universe . in the optical spectrum of sdss 0836 + 0054 , however , the gunn ",
    "peterson effect is not seen .",
    "there is detectable emission blueward of the ly@xmath8 line , i.e. the intergalactic medium is already highly ionized at @xmath9 along this line of sight @xcite .",
    "the estimated mass of the central black hole in sdss 0836 + 0054 is @xmath10 , assuming that the quasar is emitting at the eddington luminosity and its apparent flux is not significantly magnified by beaming or gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "there are , however , indications that the latter assumptions may not be correct .",
    "simulations show that up to one third of @xmath7 quasars may be magnified due to gravitational lensing by a factor of ten or more",
    ". therefore their black hole masses are overestimated by the same factor @xcite .",
    "the probability estimations strongly depend on the quasar luminosity function used . considering a wider range of possible luminosity functions , @xcite",
    "conclude that present data allow lensing probability of essentially 100% . in turn",
    ", the luminosity function can be constrained using the detections or absence of lensing events with multiple images of @xmath7 quasars .",
    "black hole mass values of @xmath11 quasars have great importance for hierarchical structure formation models in the early universe , placing important constraints on parameters such as the seed mass , velocity dispersion , radiative efficiency and accretion luminosity .",
    "the time needed for a supermassive @xmath12 black hole to grow from a stellar - mass seed may be comparable to the age of the universe at this redshift @xcite .    the first four @xmath2 sdss quasars @xcite including sdss 0836 + 0054 are detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "short exploratory chandra observations revealed that sdss 0836 + 0054 is consistent with a point - like x - ray source @xcite .",
    "its position agrees with the optical position within the astrometric precision of chandra ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "based on the limited data available , the broad - band x - ray and optical properties of the extremely distant quasars are apparently similar to those of lower redshift ones , implying no strong evolution out to @xmath7 @xcite . on the contrary , @xcite found that high - redshift quasars are significantly more x - ray quiet than their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "any indication of a milli - arcsecond scale `` core  jet '' radio structure revealed by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) could be considered as a strong support for the existence of a supermassive black hole powering sdss 0836 + 0054 .",
    "these structures are common in radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the broadest range of redshifts from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the agn paradigm , the radio emission originates from incoherent synchrotron emission in compact ( parsec - scale ) jets in the close vicinity of the central black hole .",
    "here we describe a 1.6-ghz european vlbi network ( evn ) observation of sdss 0836 + 0054 and present the high resolution radio image of the quasar . based on our phase - reference vlbi observation",
    ", we derive the accurate astrometric position of the object .",
    "we conclude that the image of the quasar is unlikely to be split by gravitational lensing . throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt a flat cosmological model with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18  km  s@xmath19  mpc@xmath19 . in this model , 1 milli - arcsecond ( mas ) angular separation corresponds to a linear separation of 6.25  pc at the distance of sdss 0836 + 0054 .",
    "we used ten antennas of the evn to observe sdss 0836 + 0054 at 1.6  ghz ( 18  cm wavelength ) in phase - reference mode .",
    "the radio telescopes and their parameters are listed in table  [ ant ] . due to the redshift , the observing frequency corresponds to 11  ghz in the rest frame of the source .",
    "phase - referencing is a technique of extending the signal coherence time in order to increase the sensitivity of the vlbi array .",
    "this is done by regularly interleaving observations between the weak target source and a nearby strong reference source .",
    "delay , delay rate and phase solutions obtained for the phase - reference calibrator are interpolated and applied for the target source , thus removing most of the phase errors introduced by geometric , ionospheric , atmospheric and instrumental effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the observation of sdss 0836 + 0054 took place on 2002 june 8 .",

    "the angular separation between the target and the reference source is @xmath21 .",
    "the icrf coordinates of pks 0837 + 012 are available from the vlba calibrator survey @xcite , with an accuracy of 0.35 and 0.58  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively . in principle",
    "it allows us to make a precise determination of the poorly known position of sdss 0836 + 0054 through differential astrometry inherently provided by the phase - referencing technique .",
    "the source j0825 + 0309 was used as a fringe - finder .    at the frequency of 1.6  ghz , variations in the ionospheric electron column density",
    "dominate the propagation effects affecting the quality of phase transfer between the target and calibrator sources .",
    "these variations have static and dynamic components , both spatial and temporal , which limit the maximum achievable dynamic range ( @xmath22 ) of vlbi phase - referencing . according to @xcite ,",
    "the upper limit of @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is peak daily residual total electron content ( tec , in units of @xmath25  m@xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the observing frequency in ghz , @xmath28 is the angular distance between the target and reference sources ( in degrees ) .",
    "our observation took place relatively close after the peak of the solar cycle . considering the worst case of the maximum tec as @xmath29  m@xmath26 ( which corresponds to the solar maximum daytime value , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the conservative estimate of the maximum achievable dynamic range is @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamic component is caused essentially by medium - scale travelling ionosphere disturbances ( mstids ) .",
    "these are time - variable and highly unpredictable .",
    "mstids are known to vary on the time scale of tens of minutes to hours and linear scale of hundreds of kilometres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "at the maximum , which normally lasts for up to 5% in time , the amplitude of mstids could worsen the upper limit of the achievable dynamic range by a factor of @xmath31 at our target  reference separation comparing to the worst case of static component ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . by splitting up the data set into four equal time intervals",
    ", we did not notice any significant difference between our results on this time scale .",
    "the total observing time was 5 hours with dual circular polarization at all antennas but sheshan where only left circular polarization was observed .",

    "the data for the calibrator and fringe - finder sources ( j0839 + 0104 and j0825 + 0309 , respectively ) were fringe - fitted in aips using 3-min solution intervals .",
    "the solutions were interpolated and applied to the data of sdss 0836 + 0054 as well .",

    "the angular resolution becomes relatively high but the image noise level increases . on the other hand",
    ", natural weighting minimizes the image noise by associating weights proportional to the power of @xmath35 of the rms noise with each data point .",
    "the residual amplitude and phase corrections derived during the hybrid mapping of the reference source using natural weighting were also applied to the data of the target quasar . the naturally weighted image of sdss 0836 + 0054 after one cycle of clean iterations is shown in fig .

    "the measured off - source rms noise in the image is 34  @xmath34jy / beam , close to the theoretical value .",
    "the quasar sdss 0836 + 0054 is clearly detected with vlbi and appears somewhat resolved at a linear resolution of @xmath36  pc ( fig .  [ target ] ) .",
    "however , the apparent structural extension may be due to the remaining residual phase errors after phase - reference calibration .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ target ] , the position of sdss 0836 + 0054 differs from the optical position reported by @xcite , but is within the given error of 200  mas in both right ascension and declination . the optical position was used in the correlation of our vlbi data as the phase center . also within the errors ,",
    "the coordinates are consistent with the values taken from the vla first survey .",
    "our values @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined with respect to the accurately known position of the phase - reference calibrator j0839 + 0104 .    however , the differential astrometry is complicated by the fact that the structure of our reference source , j0839 + 0104 , is rather complex . as seen in fig .",
    "[ calibrator]b , there is a low surface brightness extended feature to the sw of the brightest component .",
    "a similar structure in terms of position angle is seen in snapshot vlba images taken at higher frequencies ( 2.3 and 8.4  ghz ) in the vlba calibrator survey @xcite . with a higher e - w resolution ( uniform weighting , fig .",
    "[ calibrator]a ) , the `` core '' splits into two distinct components 6.6  mas apart . supposing that the jet is one - sided , we suspect that the true flat - spectrum vlbi core of the quasar is the eastern one which is weaker at 1.6  ghz .",
    "most likely this is the reference point of which the accurate coordinates are determined using 8.4-ghz vlbi observations . on the other hand , the brightest feature in our image may well be a steep - spectrum jet component which appears stronger than the core at this lower frequency .",
    "it could not be excluded , however , that the brightest component in fig .",
    "[ calibrator]a coincides with the core .",
    "this remains to be checked with high - resolution vlbi imaging of j0839 + 0104 at frequencies higher than 1.6  ghz .",
    "since the brightest component of the reference source , which is presumably not identical with the radio core , is in the phase center of our image , the relative position determination of the target source may be corrupted by a systematic error . therefore we give a conservative error estimate of 8  mas for the position of sdss 0836 + 0054 .",
    "this reflects the uncertainty in the identification of the reference point in the radio image of the phase - reference calibrator source j0839 + 0104 .",
    "we searched for possible multiple images of sdss 0836 + 0054 that might have been caused by gravitational lensing . to this end , we investigated a large ( @xmath39 ) field of view centered around the a priori position of sdss 0836 + 0054 . to avoid distortion of the field of view due to frequency - average smearing",
    ", we averaged our data over only 8-mhz channels for imaging .",
    "we used the correlator output averaging time of 4 s which did not limit our field of view .",
    "no source of compact radio emission has been detected at the brightness level of @xmath40  @xmath34jy / beam ( 3 times the image noise ) , apart from what is seen in fig .",
    "[ target ] .",
    "moreover , the total flux density in the clean component model corresponding to the naturally weighted image of sdss 0836 + 0054 ( fig .  [ target ] ) is 1.1  mjy .",
    "this is equal to the flux density in the vla first survey .",
    "although the source total flux density recently measured with the vla at 1.4  ghz is 1.76  mjy ( a. petric et al .",
    ", in preperation ) , the difference may be attributed to source variability and , to a lesser extent , amplitude calibration uncertainties in our vlbi data as well .",
    "our result suggests that most if not all of the radio emission of sdss 0836 + 0054 is confined to a single compact object within an angular extent of @xmath1  mas .",
    "thus we can conclude that the quasar is not multiply imaged by gravitational lensing at the level of brightness ratio @xmath41 . outside of our field of view",
    ", there are no indications of multiple images neither in the vla first and nvss surveys , nor in the chandra x - ray image ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most recently , @xcite found that the high resolution ( @xmath42 ) hst optical image of sdss 0836 + 0054 is consistent with an unresolved point source .",
    "however , it does not exclude the possibility that its flux is magnified by a factor of up to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "note that , based on the size of the ioinized region around another sdss quasar at @xmath44 , @xcite place an upper limit of 5 for the magnification factor in that case .",

    ", in preperation ; @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the flux density and @xmath27 is the frequency ) , the luminosity of sdss 0836 + 0054 at 5  ghz ( rest frame ) is @xmath48  w  hz@xmath19  sr@xmath19 . together with the estimated black hole mass of @xmath49 @xcite , this value is consistent with the @xmath50 relation found for radio quasars at @xmath51 ( * ? ? ?",
