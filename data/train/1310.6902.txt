    "frustrated magnetic systems have become a topic of particular interest in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the geometrical frustration arises from the specific geometry of the system , rather than from disorder .",
    "it leads to ` exotic ' low - temperature states , for example spin ice . in pyrochlore lattices",
    " prominent compounds are dysprosium and holmium titanate , the spins arranged in corner - sharing tetrahedra mimic the hydrogen positions in water ice@xcite .",
    "experiments have found evidence for the existence of magnetic monopoles in these materials@xcite , showing properties of hypothetical magnetic monopoles postulated to exist in vacuum@xcite .",
    "but also nano - scale arrays of ferromagnetic single - domain islands can show an artificial spin ice@xcite .",
    "artificial spin ice consists of twodimensional periodic arrangements of nanometer - sized magnets .",
    "these nanoislands are typically elongated to show a single - domain state@xcite , modeled for example as a magnetic dipole ; the magnetic moment of a single island then points in one of two directions . because the nanoislands are isolated from each other  e.g . , separated by a distance of the order of several hundred nanometer , they are coupled by the long - range dipole - dipole interaction@xcite .",
    "typical geometries of the nano - scale arrays are honeycomb or square lattices , fabricated using microstructuring techniques which allow for fine - tuning to obtain specific properties@xcite . shifting the rows and columns of a square lattice vertically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) , by an amount determined by the lattice spacing and the islands dimensions , one can produce the same degree of degeneracy in the ground state as in pyrochlore spin ice@xcite and the same residual entropy as water ice at zero temperature @xcite .    because of the specific geometries used so far , artificial spin ice was hardly thermally active@xcite : for permalloy nanomagnets , the magnetic moment of each island is in the order of some @xmath1 bohr magneton , equivalent to an interaction energy of about @xmath2{j}$ ] .",
    "thus in simulations , the activation temperature is much larger than the melting temperature of permalloy ( @xmath3{k}$ ] ) .",
    "however in recent investigations by farhan and coworkers , thermal activation at @xmath4{k}$ ] has been shown for up to three hexagons of nanomagnets@xcite and for a square spin - ice lattice@xcite .",
    "the theoretical investigation presented in this paper relies on the experimentally feasible nanoisland dimensions of ref .   in order to study thermal excitations at room temperature for square spin ice lattices . as one result",
    ", we confirm the thermal activation at @xmath4{k}$ ] and below ( e.g. , at room temperature ) found experimentally .",
    "moreover , the calculated switching rates of the nanomagnets are in the order of @xmath5{s^{-1}}$ ] , thus accessible by experimental techniques .    in a ground state ,",

    "string excitations@xcite are then given by a pair of these emergent quasi - monopoles@xcite with opposite charge that are connected by a ferromagnetic path of nanomagnets@xcite .",
    "while these strings have been produced by experimentally by an external magnetic field , we focus in this paper on their thermal excitation .",
    "the response of the system to an external perturbation is observed by a variety of experimental techniques , for example photoemission electron microscopy@xcite .    in the most part , string excitations with @xmath9 nodes",

    "we show in this paper that the above - mentioned vertical displacement in the square lattice leads to a drastic increase of the number of @xmath10 string excitations , in particular at low temperatures .",

    "appendices comprise information on the dipolar energies ( [ sec : energies ] ) and the monte carlo simulations ( [ sec : monte ] ) .",
    "in this section we address those aspects of the theoretical approach needed for the discussion of the results . for more details ,",
    "we refer to the appendices .    for the present study we consider nanomagnets with dimensions taken from ref .",

    "the computation of the dipole - dipole energies is done numerically , allowing in principle for arbitrarily shaped nanoislands .",

    "it is important to mention that in the honeycomb lattice this sixfold degeneracy is out of 8 possible vertices ; in the square lattice considered here the sixfold degeneracy is out of 16 vertices ( cf .",

    "however , one may consider both lattices and their magnetic ground states equivalent because both have the same residual entropy of @xmath51 ( appendix [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the approach of @xmath22 to @xmath23 reduces the total energy and , thus , enhances the thermal activity , allowing simulations already for room temperature .    for the present samples , we obtain @xmath52 , which is a monotonous function of the lattice constant @xmath15 ( inset in fig .",

    "a string excitations is identified as a ferromagnetic path of nanoislands connecting a pair of nodes with opposite nonzero charges ( fig .",

    ", we address the fraction of nodes with charge @xmath6 in the sample , @xmath58 ; on average @xmath59 .    in this paper , we report on results for a lattice with @xmath60 cells with @xmath43 nanomagnets each ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "these samples are large enough to suppress even minute finite - size effects ( edge effects ) , as has been checked by comparison with calculations for larger arrays .",
    "the dynamics is obtained by kinetic monte carlo simulations , accompanied by standard monte carlo calculations@xcite ( see appendix  [ sec : monte ] ) .",

    "a closer inspection shows that ` 2in2outop ' vertices dominate for @xmath41 , in agreement with earlier work ( e.g. , ref .  ) . upon increasing @xmath20",
    ", the number of ` 2in2outad ' vertices grows . especially at @xmath52 , all six ` 2in2out ' vertices are equally likely ; this is explained by the energy barrier between the ` 2in2outad ' and ` 2in2outop ' vertices which vanishes for this particular vertical displacement .",
    "the system tends to form ` 2in2outop ' and ` 2in2outad ' domains , where the shape of the domains depends on the numerical ` cooling - down ' procedure used to obtain the global , highly degenerate free - energy minimum ( appendix  [ sec : monte ] ) . for @xmath66 , ` 2in2outad ' vertices prevail .",
    "elevated temperatures lead to changes of size and to propagation of domains .",
    "we now show that the square - lattice dipolar arrays are thermally active at room temperature and that the rate of spin reversals depends significantly on the vertical displacement @xmath20 .",
    "thermal activity at @xmath64{k}$ ] can not be ruled out _ per se _ because the maximum nearest - neighbor interaction energy @xmath22 of @xmath67{mev}$ ] is less than the thermal energy @xmath68{mev}$ ] ; cf .",
    "[ fig : energies ] .    according to the implementation of the kinetic monte carlo method ( ref .   and appendix  [ sec : monte ] )",
    ", the rate @xmath69 of spin reversals scales exponentially with temperature and the energy barrier , since @xmath69 follows an arrhenius form .",
    "the barrier height depends on the initial and final configurational energies @xmath70 and @xmath71 and is assumed linear@xcite : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is an empirical parameter taken from ref .  .",
    "thermal activation is addressed by the duration  or rest time  between reversal of nanoislands .",
    "figure  [ fig : thermal]a shows two representative sequences of magnetization reversal of one selected nanoisland ; these could be measured by a local probe .",
    "obviously , the reversal rate is larger for @xmath52 as compared to that for @xmath41 ; in other words , the rest time becomes smaller with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "for the sequences shown , we obtain average rest times of @xmath74{s}$ ] and @xmath75{s}$ ] for @xmath52 and @xmath36 , respectively , at @xmath76{k}$ ] .",
    "similar to the rest time of a single island , one can record the rest time of an entire sample .",
    "this duration is defined as the time between reversals of any nanoislands in the array . for arrays with @xmath77 islands at @xmath76{k}$ ] ,",
    "we obtain average rest times of @xmath78{s}$ ] and @xmath79{s}$ ] for @xmath52 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than that of a single island ; they scale inversely with the number of islands in the sample ; more precisely , they are about @xmath80 of the single - island rest time . because of the abovementioned arrhenius behavior , rest times decrease significantly with temperature : for @xmath4{k}$ ] , as has been applied in ref .  , our simulations yield durations of the order of a few milliseconds .",
    "we point out that the rest times should not be confused with the residence time defined in ref .  .",
    "the residence time is defined as the duration between the reversal of the flux chirality of a plaquette ( @xmath81{s}$ ] for the hexagonal rings studied in ref .  ) .",
    "such a definition is somewhat problematic for a square lattice because its plaquettes must not show flux closure .",
    "for zero vertical displacement @xmath41 , the ground state ` 2in2outop ' nodes result in closed loops for the plaquettes ; this can be viewed as energy - minimizing ` flux closures ' .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath52 , for which there are ` 2in2outad ' nodes in addition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] ) .",
    "this loss of flux closure is explained by the increased degeneracy of the ` 2in2out ' nodes and a considerable number of nodes with charge @xmath82 ; see top row in fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] .      a finite temperature below the critical temperature of the nanoislands leads to thermal excitations with nonzero charge@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : charge ] ; note that @xmath59 ) : the larger @xmath83 , the smaller is @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , @xmath85 is less than @xmath86{\\%}$ ] for samples with @xmath41 at elevated temperatures ; at room temperature it is extremely small .",
    "a closer inspection reveals , however , that @xmath85 is strongly enhanced for @xmath52 as compared to samples with @xmath41 ( fig .",

    ", this increase may be regarded insignificant .",
    "however at room temperature , we find an enhancement by a factor as large as @xmath89 [ inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge](c ) ] .",
    "vertical displacement is , therefore , a means to enhance the number of excitations ; their number may be sufficiently large to allow investigations of ensembles of string excitations@xcite .",
    "so far , we considered the fractions of nonzero charges in a sample .",
    "that string excitations are present is evident from a snapshot of a kinetic monte carlo simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] ) .",
    "while a large part of the sample shows a ground - state configuration , there is also a single string excitation : a path of ferromagnetically aligned nanomagnets ( green nanomagnets in fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] ) connects a quasi - monopole of charge @xmath40 ( indicated by the blue circle , with ` 4out ' arrangement ) with a quasi - monopole of charge @xmath33 ( red circle , with ` 4 in ' arrangement ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of nodes with opposite charges is analyzed by means of the charge - correlation function @xmath90 which defines the probability of simultaneously finding a charge @xmath91 at position @xmath92 and a charge @xmath93 at position @xmath94 .",

    "pairs of nodes with identical charges @xmath97 can not show up as nearest neighbors because of the lattice geometry ( one nanomagnet would be shared among a pair ) .",
    "@xmath98 shows no clear indication for short distances @xmath99 rather than a uniform distribution ( open squares in fig .",

    "one can produce samples with a prescribed temperature dependence of the string - excitation density .",
    "the thermal stability ( mean average time ) can be chosen to match the time resolution of the experimental probing technique .",
