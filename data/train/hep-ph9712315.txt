    "the most precise estimate of the slepton production cross sections would be needed .",

    "the nlo enhancements of the cross sections at tevatron energies push some predictions for signals at the mi above the 5@xmath96 level . at the lhc , where a slepton mass measurement may be made indirectly on the basis of event rates rather than by reconstruction ,",
