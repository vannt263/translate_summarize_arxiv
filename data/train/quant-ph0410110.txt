    "the self energy is the dominant contribution of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) to the energy levels of these one - electron atomic systems ( see , _ e.g. _ , fig .  2 in ref .",
    "the total energy of the orbiting electron can be expressed as the following sum ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath0 where the term denoted by `` rest '' encompasses other forces ( strong and weak ) , as well as mixed effects ( _ e.g. _ , the energy shift due to recoil in a qed process ) .",
    "the self energy is generally the largest contribution to the `` pure qed '' term , and in particular to the lamb shift  @xcite .",
    "the self energy is the qed process in which the electron emits a photon and re - absorbs it , as is depicted in the corresponding feynman diagram : @xmath1 where the double line and the wavy line respectively represent the electron ( bound to the nucleus ) and a photon .    calculating qed effects in atoms",
    "is of general interest .",
    "first , high - precision spectroscopy results can only be fully explained within qed ; an example is the well - known lamb shift  @xcite and its calculation by bethe  @xcite .",
    "second , precise atomic qed calculations , along with corresponding experiments , give some of the most precise determinations of some fundamental constants  @xcite , notably the rydberg constant  @xcite and the mass of the electron  @xcite ; the fine structure constant  @xmath2  @xcite and the proton charge radius  @xcite are also expected to be soon determined with very high accuracy from atomic studies .",
    "last , highly - charged hydrogen - like ions allow for tests of qed in situations where an electron experiences a strong field .",
    "the electric field at the surface of a uranium nucleus is thus about @xmath3  v / m  @xcite ; this value can for instance be compared to the characteristic field @xmath4 of about @xmath5",

    "@xmath14  denotes the electron principal quantum number and @xmath15  is the nuclear charge number of the hydrogen - like ion .",
    "previous studies have concentrated on lower-@xmath14 and lower angular momentum states .",
    "the results presented here have applications in the adjustment of the rydberg constant  @xcite : the new results for hydrogen were obtained for all the non - s levels of  @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , for all the ( non - s ) levels that are implied in the principal spectroscopy experiments contributing to the rydberg constant .",
    "the self energy of the states included in the figure can also be used for including qed effects in the energy levels of atoms and ions ( possibly via extrapolations or interpolations ) . ]",
    "the purpose of this paper is to graphically present new self - energy shifts in hydrogen - like ions with nuclear charge number larger than  20 .",
    "we also report the high - precision evaluation , for many states , of self energies in hydrogen , and briefly describe the method we used .",
    "all the self energies were calculated for a static , point nucleus ( finite proton mass and non - zero proton radius effects can be treated as a perturbation ) .",
    "hydrogen is a system in which precise numerical calculations that treat the electron - proton interaction without perturbation are recent and notoriously difficult  @xcite  numerical self - energy calculations were originally designed for highly - charged hydrogen - like ions  @xcite .",
    "the atomic states for which we calculated the self energy are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : knownses ] , and extend the set of states considered in previous works .",
    "the self - energy values considered here were obtained with a high precision , and a known uncertainty ( which contrasts with perturbation calculations , in which omitted terms can be difficult to estimate  @xcite ) . in hydrogen , we take `` high precision '' to mean that energy shifts have an uncertainty of about 1  hz : in fact , spectroscopy experiments are reaching the 1  hz limit in the visible domain  @xcite . having high - precision self - energy shifts available",
    "is also useful for obtaining precise extrapolations ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : hydrogenshift ] ) and for performing comparisons between independent calculations .",
    "in this paper , the self - energy shifts  @xmath16 are expressed with the conventional `` reduced '' self energy  @xmath17 , which is defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19  is the usual spectroscopic notation for an electron of principal quantum number  @xmath14 , orbital angular momentum  @xmath20 and total angular momentum  @xmath21 ; @xmath15  is the nuclear charge number .",
    "much of the behavior of the self - energy shift  @xmath16 with @xmath14 and  @xmath15 is captured in this formula : @xmath17  has the property of not varying much with these parameters ( see , _ e.g. _ , sec .  [",
    "sec : semiddlehighz])the dependence of  @xmath17 on the angular momenta @xmath22 and  @xmath21 can be estimated from the perturbation expansion of  @xmath17 ( see , _",

    "figure  [ fig : knownses ] shows the states for which self - energy results are presented .",
    "the nucleus is approximated as a point - like charge of infinite mass .",

    "the typical relative precision of these self - energy values is @xmath23 ( numerical values will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "as can be seen in the graphs , the reduced self energy of d , f and g states does not vary much with @xmath14 and  @xmath15 ( changes of the order of 10  % ) .",
    "this implies that extrapolations of the self energy to states with other principal quantum numbers than those considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : sevalues ] can be done to a good precision .",
    "we expect such a smooth behavior of  @xmath17 with @xmath14 and  @xmath15 to generally hold for electrons of higher angular momentum .",

    "the values for @xmath24 are new , while higher-@xmath15 results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the weak dependence of  @xmath17 on @xmath14 and  @xmath15 indicates that the self energy shift  @xmath16 scales essentially as @xmath25 , as can be seen from eq .",

    "in order to compute  ( [ eq : integraltobecalculated ] ) , we used a method developed by one of us ( p.j.m .",
    "@xcite ) , along with the corresponding code .",
    "contrary to methods introduced before  @xcite , it allows for precise calculations of the electron self energy over a large range of nuclei ( @xmath32@xmath33  @xcite ) ; this was made possible through the use of analytic expressions of the dirac green s function , and of an integration order in  ( [ eq : integraltobecalculated ] ) that guarantees good convergence properties in numerical calculations .",
    "the code was incrementally improved along two directions : a more efficient handling of renormalization  @xcite , and the possibility of calculating the self energy of states with `` large '' total angular momentum @xmath34",
    ". the calculation of  ( [ eq : integraltobecalculated ] ) requires high - precision evaluations of integrals and of hypergeometric functions ( and in particular whittaker functions ) .",

    "the range of nuclear charges under consideration ( @xmath44 ) extends beyond the range of results of ref .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of an @xmath45 electron in the ground state of atoms can reach @xmath46 ( f  states ) , and that of an @xmath47 electron , @xmath48 ( d  states ) ; the self energy was thus calculated for both 5f and 6f  states ( see fig .  [ fig : sevalues ] ) , so as to provide values that could be used in atomic calculations that incorporate qed corrections ( see also ref .",
    "the self energy was also calculated for higher-@xmath14 d and f  electrons , so as to cover some excited atomic states . moreover ,",

    "[ fig : sevalues ] , which represent the dominant qed shift , might be useful in interpreting coming experiments .",
    "finally , these results , which do not treat the electron - nucleus interaction with perturbation theory , allow for checks of corresponding perturbation results  @xcite .",
    "this section describes how we obtained self - energy shifts in hydrogen through interpolations and extrapolations , to a high precision ( better than 2  hz ) for the hydrogen states included in fig .",
    "[ fig : knownses ] . as for the middle-@xmath15 results ,",
    "only the leading self - energy contribution  @xmath16 , obtained for an infinite - mass , point - like nucleus , is discussed here . with the extrapolation method described below , we obtained for instance the self energy shift value @xmath49",
    "this value is consistent with previous estimates of the 4p@xmath50 self energy  ( see  ref .  @xcite and ref .",

    "thus , for non - s states , the reduced self energy in eq .",

    "no other coefficient than the three present in  ( [ eq : fperturbation3coefs ] ) is currently known ; references about the known coefficients can for instance be found in  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to truncate expansion  ( [ eq : fperturbation3coefs ] ) to the first two terms , and estimate the self energy of a 4p@xmath50 electron as @xmath55 where the uncertainty is defined by letting @xmath56 , and where question marks indicate that the uncertainty is only an estimate .",
    "the crude estimate used here is intended to illustrate the usefulness of exact numerical calculations ( as opposed to pure perturbation calculations ) in situations where not much is known about the perturbation remainder .",
    "the numerical examples we use here are given for demonstration purposes only ( in fact , in the particular case of the 4p@xmath50 level , the remainder has been previously evaluated to good accuracy  @xcite ) .",
    "doing the same with the first three terms in ( [ eq : fperturbation3coefs])_i.e . _  with all the terms calculated with perturbation theory ",
    "yields @xmath57 where the value @xmath58 was assigned . by comparing ( [ eq : f4p1_2coefs ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : f4p1_3coefs ] ) with the exact result  ( [ eq : f4p1_exact ] ) , we see that the exact result is more precise than the perturbation estimates .",

    ", it is possible to plot its curve and visually estimate the limit along with an uncertainty ( left - hand graph ) .",
    "a more precise estimate can be obtained by performing a linear interpolation between two successive points of the curve , and plotting the ordinate of the line at its intersection with the @xmath59 axis , as a function of the average  @xmath15 of the two points ( right - hand graph ) .",
    "this process can be generalized to polynomial interpolations of each group of three ( or more ) successive data points of  @xmath60 : each interpolation has a value at @xmath59 , which can be plotted as in the right - hand graph .",
    "higher - order interpolations can yield more and more precise estimates of @xmath62 . ]",
    "our high - precision self - energy values were obtained by using middle-@xmath15 numerical self energies and performing interpolations and extrapolations to hydrogen , _",
    "i.e. _ , to @xmath59 .",
    "similar methods were used in the past , and yielded very accurate self - energy values ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "with the recent application  @xcite of convergence acceleration techniques to the calculation method we use , a direct numerical computation of self - energy shifts in hydrogen could have been possible for any  @xcite of the states of hydrogen depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : knownses ] .",
    "however , the computation of the self - energy shift of one @xmath19 level takes a few weeks , on a modern processor , and a simpler method can yield values with an accuracy better than the experimental precision .",
    "we thus performed extrapolations of middle-@xmath15 self - energy shifts or interpolations between perturbation and exact results ( middle-@xmath15 self energies were found in previously published works , or taken from the results presented in sec .

    "the self - energy values in hydrogen considered here were obtained by taking advantage of the availability of both perturbation and exact numerical results ( which permitted interpolations and precision extrapolations ) . nonetheless , it is desirable to perform a direct numerical evaluation of these energy shifts , and check their consistency with the values presented here .",
