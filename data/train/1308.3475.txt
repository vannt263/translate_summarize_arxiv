    "in this work we develop spectral theory for the @xmath0-boson ( stochastic ) particle system - boson totally asymmetric diffusion model while in @xcite it was also referred to as @xmath0-tazrp .",
    "the term `` stochastic '' is included here to differentiate this with the non - stochastic quantum particle system considered in earlier work @xcite under the name @xmath0-bosons . that earlier studied system is a special limit of the more general system presently considered ( see section [ vandiejen ] ) . despite this , in what follows we will generally suppress the term `` stochastic '' , though still always referring to the stochastic particle system ] .",
    "this is an interacting particle system whose generator is a stochastic representation of the generalization of the @xmath0-boson hamiltonian introduced by sasamoto - wadati in 1998 @xcite ( see section [ afortiori ] for more details ) .",
    "the system ( in fact , a totally asymmetric zero range process ) consists of @xmath1 particles on @xmath2 with locations labeled by @xmath3 . in continuous time , each cluster of particles with the same location transfers one particle to the left by one at rate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the size of the cluster and @xmath0 is a parameter fixed between 0 and 1 . in order to preserve the ordering of @xmath6 ,",
    "the highest index particle in a cluster is always the one which moves left .",
    "this particle system can be understood as being a discrete space , @xmath0-deformation of the continuum delta bose gas on @xmath7 with attractive coupling constant ( see section [ deltabosesec ] ) .",
    "this delta bose gas has a rich history , going back to the foundational work of lieb - liniger in 1963 @xcite , and it has recently played an important role in the physics literature @xcite surrounding the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation and universality class ( which includes random growth models , interacting particle systems and directed polymers  see the review @xcite ) .",
    "more exactly the moments ( for a fixed time @xmath8 but possibly different spatial locations @xmath9 ) of the solution to the stochastic heat equation ( whose logarithm is the kpz equation that models a randomly growing interface ) satisfy the delta bose gas with initial data corresponding to the initial data of the stochastic heat equation . for more details",
    "see section [ deltabosesec ] .",
    "the moment problem for the solution to the stochastic heat equation is not well - posed since its moments , though all finite , grow too fast to characterize the distribution of the solution . despite this mathematical limitation , there has been a significant amount of non - rigorous work using these moment formulas to extract distributional information about the solutions to kpz equation  this sometimes goes by the name of the polymer replica method . in the instances for which rigorous results were available via other means @xcite it has been checked that these computations have yielded the correct answer .",
    "there are now many non - rigorous kpz distribution computations  such as those involving different types of initial data ( flat / half - flat @xcite , stationary @xcite , or more general @xcite ) or different times @xcite  which are based on this technique and which do not yet have rigorous counterparts .",
    "such computations involve some level of guessing ( as to how to sum certain divergent series ) which varies problem to problem , hence it is hard to be confident ( let alone prove ) whether the outcome of each additional computation will yield the correct answer .",
    "one way to put this line of work on a firm , even rigorous footing is to find discrete regularizations of the kpz equation which are integrable and well - posed in the sense that formulas for moments characterize the distribution .",
    "one such system is the @xmath0-deformed totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( @xmath0-tasep ) which was introduced by borodin - corwin @xcite in 2011 via the framework of macdonald processes .",
    "it was later observed by borodin - corwin - sasamoto @xcite that moments of @xmath0-tasep solve the @xmath0-boson particle system with initial data corresponding to the initial condition of @xmath0-tasep .",
    "drawing on @xcite , in @xcite this system was explicitly solved for one family of initial data ( corresponding to @xmath0-tasep started from half - stationary initial condition ) . until now , it was not clear how to analyze this system for general initial data , as would be necessary to rigorously approach the many problems studied via the polymer replica method in the past few years .",
    "the reason why the delta bose gas can be solved for general initial data is that it is known how to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "though the eigenfunctions for this hamiltonian have been known via coordinate bethe ansatz @xcite since the work of lieb - liniger @xcite , alone they do not suffice to solve the time evolution equation .",
    "ultimately this requires a plancherel formula which shows how to decompose general initial data onto a subset of the algebraic eigenfunctions ( and hence shows completeness of the bethe ansatz as well ) .",
    "various forms of such a result have been proved in @xcite for the delta bose gas .    in this present work",
    "we prove a plancherel formula for the @xmath0-boson particle system .",
    "this allows us to explicitly compute the moments of @xmath0-tasep for general initial data which will hopefully serve as the basis for further rigorous asymptotic work confirming the results of the previously made non - rigorous calculations about the kpz equation .",
    "our proof of the plancherel formula is fairly simple , relying in part on the _ contour shift argument _ used in heckman - opdam s proof of the delta bose gas plancherel formula @xcite ( see section [ plansec ] for more history on this argument ) . in that previous work ,",
    "the hermiticity of the hamiltonian played an important rule . in our work",
    "we consider a non - hermitian hamiltonian , however we find that a symmetry ( known sometimes as pt - invariance or joint space - reflection and time - reversal symmetry ) between our hamiltonian and its adjoint is a suitable replacement for hermiticity , see remark [ commrem ] .",
    "a large part of the paper is devoted to modifications , implications and degenerations of this core result .",
    "for example , the plancherel formula immediately implies a ( spatial ) orthogonality of the left and right eigenfunctions and suggests a second ( spectral ) orthogonality which we prove separately by ultimately appealing to the cauchy - littlewood formula for hall - littlewood ( multivariate symmetric ) polynomials ( though we should emphasize that our eigenfunctions are not hall - littlewood polynomials and only degenerate to them in a certain limit ) . with minor modifications",
    "all results ( though not necessarily the probabilistic interpretations ) apply for more general parameter @xmath10 .",
    "such @xmath0 ( especially on the complex unit circle ) arise naturally from a quantum physics perspective ( see section [ complexq ] ) .",
    "it is possible to take a limit of the @xmath0-boson particle system so as to recover the continuum delta bose gas and its plancherel formula .",
    "there are also two discrete space limits we study ",
    "one leads to a delta bose gas and plancherel formula previously studied by van diejen @xcite and another leads to the delta bose gas and plancherel formula related to the semi - discrete stochastic heat equation ( or equivalently the oconnell - yor semi - discrete directed polymer partition function ) .",
    "there exist other integrable discrete regularizations of the kpz equation ( and delta bose gas ) such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) or @xmath0-pushasep @xcite . in a companion paper @xcite we prove ( in a similar manner as here ) a plancherel formula for asep and the heisenberg xxz quantum spin chain on @xmath2 ( thus recovering the xxz results of @xcite in a different manner ) .",
    "let @xmath11 .",
    "the backward generator for the @xmath0-boson particle system is written @xmath12 and defined via its action on functions @xmath13 as @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes the number of clusters of @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the sizes of these clusters ( so that @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 . the forward generator of the @xmath0-boson particle system is written @xmath20 and given by the matrix transpose of @xmath12 ( see definition [ bwdgendef ] for its explicit action ) .",

    "define the function @xmath21 by @xmath22 where @xmath17 are as above , and @xmath23 is the @xmath0-factorial .",
    "this is an invariant measure for the @xmath0-boson particle system and the backward and forward generators are related by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the multiplication operator @xmath27 .",
    "this relationship is sometimes called pt - invariance , see remark [ commrem ] .    for all",
    "@xmath28 , set @xmath29    our first result is that these are the right eigenfunctions of @xmath12 and @xmath20 ( respectively ) .    for all @xmath28",
    ", we have @xmath30    the proof of this result is based on the fact that the backward and ( @xmath26-conjugated ) forward generators can be rewritten as free generators subject to @xmath31 two - body boundary conditions .",
    "the coordinate bethe ansatz then readily implies the result . since we are working on @xmath2 ( as opposed to a finite or periodic interval )",
    "there are no bethe equations to be solved .",
    "since @xmath32 is a right eigenfunction for the forward generator @xmath20 , and @xmath20 is the matrix transpose of @xmath12 , it follows that @xmath33 is also a left eigenfunction for @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we use the alternative notation @xmath34    we now proceed to our main result  a plancherel type isomorphism theorem .",
    "let @xmath35 be the space of functions @xmath13 of compact support , and let @xmath36 be the space of symmetric laurent polynomials @xmath37 in the variables @xmath38 .",

    "the @xmath0-boson transform @xmath62 induces an isomorphism between @xmath35 and @xmath36 with inverse given by @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath73 @xmath74 and for any @xmath49 @xmath75 here @xmath76 is defined via its action @xmath77 and is the operator which maps right eigenfunctions to left eigenfunctions .",
    "one immediate corollary of this plancherel isomorphism theorem is the completeness of the coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "[ compl ] for all @xmath78 , @xmath79    this shows that the space @xmath35 is decomposed onto left ( and right ) eigenfunctions with spectral variables @xmath80 over all @xmath81 and @xmath82 of length @xmath83 , with respect to the ( complex - valued ) plancherel measure given above in ( [ dmulambda ] ) .",
    "the lack of positivity of this measure should be compared to the case of hermitian hamiltonians such as the heisenberg xxz quantum spin chain on @xmath2 or delta bose gas on @xmath7 .",
    "thus our plancherel isomorphism theorem is not an isomorphism between @xmath84 spaces .",
    "there are some degenerations of this system which admit @xmath84 space isomorphisms , namely the system considered in sections [ vandiejen ] and [ deltabosesec ] .",
    "the system considered in section [ semidiscsec ] involves a complex - valued plancherel measure , and likewise does not admit an @xmath84 isomorphism .    in applying a contour shift argument ( used , for instance , in heckman - opdam s proof of the delta bose gas plancherel formula @xcite ) in this proof of the plancherel formula",
    ", the non - hermitian nature of our hamiltonian introduces some additional non - triviality .",
    "however , the symmetry given earlier in ( [ ptsym ] ) between @xmath12 and @xmath20 ( see also remark [ commrem ] ) is a suitable replacement for hermiticity .",
    "the plancherel isomorphism theorem also contains within it the biorthogonality ( with respect to the spatial variable @xmath6 and spectral variable @xmath82 ) of the left and right eigenfunctions ( see corollary [ north ] and proposition [ specorth ] below ) .    the completeness result above along with the fact that @xmath85 is a right eigenfunction for @xmath12 , enables us to explicitly solve the kolmogorov backward equation for the @xmath0-boson particle system with general initial data in @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath0-boson particle system plays an analogous role to @xmath0-tasep , as the continuum delta bose gas plays to the kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( cf .",
    "section [ deltabosesec ] ) .",
    "more precisely , due to a markov duality ( see section [ qtasepsec ] or @xcite ) , if we write the trajectory of @xmath0-tasep as @xmath86 , then @xmath87\\ ] ] solves the @xmath0-boson particle system kolmogorov backward equation @xmath88 with initial data depending on the initial condition @xmath89 for @xmath0-tasep .    since we know how to solve the backward equation ( via the spectral decomposition above ) , this gives us access to exact formulas for moments of @xmath0-tasep started from any initial data .",
    "however , such an exact formula does involve evaluating @xmath90 , where @xmath91 . for certain types of initial data",
    "this summation can be explicitly calculated ( see for instance corollary [ abovecor2 ] and lemma [ belowlemma ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that if @xmath92 for some function @xmath93 , then the plancherel isomorphism theorem implies that @xmath94 .",
    "this provides a systematic way to discover and proof many new combinatorial formulas .",
    "in particular , for @xmath0-tasep with step initial condition ( i.e. , @xmath95 for @xmath96 ) , this approach leads to ( see proposition [ dualiyresult ] below ) @xmath97   = ( -1)^k q^{\\frac{k(k-1)}{2 } } \\oint_{\\gamma_1 } \\frac{dz_1}{2\\pi { \\mathbf i}}\\cdots \\oint_{\\gamma_k } \\frac{dz_k}{2\\pi { \\mathbf i } } \\prod_{1\\leq a < b\\leq k } \\frac{z_a - z_b}{z_a - qz_b } \\prod_{j=1}^{k } ( 1-z_j)^{-n_j } \\frac{e^{(q-1)tz_j}}{z_j},\\ ] ] where @xmath98 are as above , with the additional condition that they do not include @xmath99 . proving this formula",
    "requires us to go beyond the functional spaces @xmath36 and @xmath35 , which in this case is readily doable .",
    "this moment formulas for step initial data has appeared previously ( though not via this spectral approach ) . with all @xmath100 it was first proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3 ) using the theory of macdonald processes .",
    "the general @xmath6 result was then proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.11 ) by simply guessing the above formula and checking that it satisfied the backward equation and initial data .",
    "the macdonald process approach was then extended in @xcite to also cover general @xmath6 . extending from step to general initial data was unclear until the present work .",
    "since @xmath101 , the above moment formulas completely characterize the distribution of @xmath0-tasep at time @xmath8 .",
    "so far , this has been used to write a fredholm determinant formula for the location of a particle @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "* theorem 3.2.11 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.12 ) ) . in turn , this formula have served as effective starting point for asymptotic analysis of a variety of models related to @xmath0-tasep ( cf .",
    "@xcite , and related work @xcite ) .",
    "the direct asymptotics ( for instance to the tracy - widom gue distribution and kpz universality class ) of @xmath0-tasep has not yet been performed , though it would seem that the above mentioned fredholm determinant formula is well suited for that .",
    "thus , as pointed out earlier , @xmath0-tasep and the @xmath0-boson particle process serve as discrete regularizations of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation and the continuum delta bose gas , for which the physics replica method can be put on firm mathematical ground .",
    "there are three related motivations which led to the present work : the polymer replica method from physics , tracy - widom s asep transition probability formulas , and measures on partitions and gelfand - tsetlin patterns ( sequences of interlacing partitions ) such as schur , whittaker and macdonald processes .",
    "we have already discussed much of our motivation coming from the polymer replica method .",
    "let us just add that the connection between the moments of the stochastic heat equation and the delta bose gas does not seem to be firmly established in the mathematical literature and some of the types of initial data one wishes to study for the kpz equation ( such as narrow wedge ) fall outside of the realm of the presently proved plancherel formulas .",
    "thus , by working with a discrete regularization , one may hope to avoid such issues as well .      in 2008 ,",
    "tracy - widom @xcite computed an exact formula for the transition probability of the @xmath52-particle asep . though the coordinate bethe ansatz was central to their work , they did not diagonalize the @xmath52-particle asep hamiltonian .",
    "we address this diagonalization in the companion paper @xcite as well as the relationship between tracy - widom s work and the asep plancherel formula .",
    "tracy - widom have recorded further progress in computing transition probabilities for variants of asep on @xmath2 ( such as on @xmath103 @xcite ) .",
    "lee @xcite has further developed tracy - widom s methods .",
    "indeed , soon after the first posting of the present work , korhonen - lee @xcite demonstrated how the tracy - widom approach can be employed to find transition probabilities for the @xmath0-boson particle system ( see also section [ transprobsec ] below )",
    ". it would be reasonable to try to develop analogous results to ours in all of these other settings .",
    "measures on partitions and gelfand - tsetlin patterns have played an important role in a wide variety of probabilistic systems including random matrix theory , random growth processes , interacting particle systems , directed polymer models , and random tilings ( see , for example , the recent review @xcite and references therein ) . during the last 15 years",
    "there was significant activity in the analysis of determinantal measures  in particular the so - called schur processes @xcite which are written in terms of schur symmetric functions .",
    "it is possible to define generalizations of the schur processes by replacing schur symmetric functions with macdonald symmetric functions ( their two - parameter @xmath104-generalizations ) . until recently ,",
    "little was done with respect to these generalizations , owing largely to the fact that they no longer are determinantal .    in 2009 ,",
    "oconnell @xcite introduced the whittaker process and related it to the oconnell - yor semi - discrete directed polymer partition function .",
    "furthermore , he utilized a whittaker function integral identity to compute an exact formula for the laplace transform of the partition function .",
    "as whittaker functions are limits ( for @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) of macdonald symmetric functions @xcite , this development was a source of motivation for borodin - corwin s @xcite subsequent 2011 work on macdonald processes .",
    "the work of borodin - corwin @xcite gives answers to two basic questions about macdonald processes ( and their various degenerations ) : what is their probabilistic content and how can one compute meaningful information and asymptotics . in order to endow the macdonald processes with probabilistic content",
    ", @xcite showed how to construct markov dynamics which map macdonald processes to other macdonald processes ( with evolved sets of parameters ) .",
    "the construction in @xcite is an adaption of one from the schur process context due to borodin - ferrari @xcite ( and based on an idea of diaconis - fill @xcite ) .",
    "there are other markov dynamics ( at various levels of degeneration of macdonald processes ) besides those considered in @xcite ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-tasep was discovered as a one - dimensional marginal of the markov dynamics corresponding to setting the macdonald parameters @xmath105 , and @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath107 , @xmath0-tasep becomes the usual tasep , and the above macdonald process turns into a schur process .    the second challenge in studying macdonald processes was to compute meaningful information and asymptotics . in @xcite",
    "this was accomplished by directly appealing to the integrable structure of the macdonald symmetric polynomials  in particular their explicit eigenfunction relationships with the macdonald difference operators .",
    "this structure naturally led to nested contour integral formulas for expectations of various observables of the macdonald processes . with regards to @xmath0-tasep ,",
    "this provided formulas for the expectation @xmath108 $ ] like ( [ page6star ] ) above . as a stochastic process",
    ", @xmath0-tasep has a scaling limit to the logarithm of the semi - discrete stochastic heat equation ( or free energy of the oconnell - yor semi - discrete directed polymer ) and further to the kpz equation ( logarithm of continuum stochastic heat equation ) .",
    "the limits of the observables studied for @xmath0-tasep correspond to products of values of the solution to these stochastic heat equations at fixed time and varying spatial location , and thus @xcite found similar nested contour integral formulas for these limits .",
    "as explained earlier , for the stochastic heat equation , these observables satisfy the delta bose gas and have a significant literature surround them .",
    "the nested contour integral formulas for the delta bose gas seem to have first appeared in 1985 physics work of yudson @xcite and reemerged independently in 1997 work of heckman - opdam @xcite proving the plancherel formula for the delta bose gas .",
    "a limitation of the macdonald process approach to studying @xmath0-tasep is that it only works for initial conditions of @xmath0-tasep which arise as marginals of macdonald processes .",
    "there are certainly many examples of such initial conditions ( an infinite - dimensional family that , in particular , includes the step initial condition ) .",
    "generic initial conditions , and certain important `` examples '' of initial conditions ( such as flat or half - flat ) do not arise in this manner and hence can not be treated via this method .",
    "inspired by the connection between the nested contour integral formulas and the delta bose gas , borodin - corwin - sasamoto @xcite discovered that it was possible to implement the ideas of the polymer replica method at the level of @xmath0-tasep ( and asep ) .",
    "in particular , they showed that for any initial conditions , the expectations @xmath109 solve a discrete @xmath0-deformed ( or regularized ) version of the delta bose gas in which the @xmath0-boson particle system generator replaces the delta bose gas hamiltonian .",
    "the initial data for the @xmath0-boson particle system backward equation directly corresponds with the initial condition for @xmath0-tasep , and @xcite showed that for step and half - stationary @xmath0-tasep initial conditions the solution @xmath109 was given by nested contour integral formulas .",
    "the step solution came directly from @xcite while the half - stationary did not ( though should correspond to a two - sided generalization of macdonald processes such as developed in the schur context in @xcite ) .",
    "the question of how to solve the @xmath0-boson particle system for general initial data ( and hence solve for @xmath109 for @xmath0-tasep with general initial conditions ) is the central motivation of the present work .",
    "the plancherel formula and its various consequences provide a solution to this question .",
    "a fortiori , this work provides some motivation to better understand the relationship between various algebraic structures .",
    "one question which was answered in @xcite was how the theory of macdonald processes implies the fact that @xmath109 solves the @xmath0-boson particle system .",
    "this relationship turned out to be a consequence of a commutation relation satisfied by the macdonald first order difference operators .",
    "however , there remain a few algebraic mysteries which we now touch upon .",
    "the @xmath0-boson particle system on a periodic lattice arises as a stochastic representation of the @xmath0-boson hamiltonian considered in @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is a generalization of an earlier version considered by bogoliubov - bullough - timonen @xcite and bogoliubov - izergin - kitanine @xcite .",
    "the algebraic @xmath0-boson hamiltonian from @xcite is written as @xmath110 here @xmath111 , @xmath112 and another set @xmath113 belong to the @xmath0-boson algebra generated by the relations @xmath114",

    "the operator @xmath116 acts on functions @xmath117 as @xmath119 where @xmath120 , and where @xmath121 .",
    "this is the backward generator of the @xmath0-boson particle system ( see section [ stochrepsec ] ) on a periodic portion of @xmath2 .",
    "this algebraic @xmath0-boson hamiltonian arises from the @xmath122-matrix given in ( 5.1 ) of @xcite and its integrability ( in the sense of satisfying the yang - baxter equations ) was shown there as well .",
    "the version studied earlier in @xcite corresponds to @xmath123 and is only stochastic in the limit when @xmath106 . due to our probabilistic motivations",
    ", we primarily consider @xmath124 here , though in section [ epdef ] we consider the general @xmath60 hamiltonian ( under the identification of @xmath125 ) and show how our results extend .",
    "the spectral theory for the periodic @xmath123 case has received attention recently in @xcite , and likewise for the infinite lattice ( as considered herein ) @xmath123 case in @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "hall - littlewood polynomials play the role of left and right eigenfunctions .",
    "another algebraic mystery has to do with two sets of symmetric functions .",
    "the macdonald process related to @xmath0-tasep is defined in terms of macdonald polynomials at @xmath105 and @xmath101 ( these are sometimes called @xmath0-whittaker functions @xcite ) . via the connection to the @xmath0-boson particle system",
    "we naturally arrive at another set of symmetric polynomials  the eigenfunctions for the @xmath0-boson particle system  which appear to be quite remarkable and ( though not the same ) are close relatives of hall - littlewood symmetric polynomials ( and degenerate to them in the limit corresponding to @xmath123 above ) .",
    "we do not presently have an algebraic explanation for this transition from one type of symmetric polynomials to another .",
    "perhaps a further investigation into the relation of @xmath0-bosons to degenerations of the double affine hecke algebra might shed light on this ( see developments in this direction in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the work of @xcite showed that for the particular step and half - stationary initial conditions , the relationship between @xmath0-tasep and the @xmath0-boson particle system persists when inhomogeneous particle jumping rate parameters @xmath126 are introduced .",
    "these @xmath127-parameters have an important meaning from the macdonald perspective as the variables of the macdonald polynomials . from the perspective of the @xmath0-boson particle system , @xcite showed that the backward generator ( similar holds true for the conjugated forward generator ) was equivalent to a free generator with inhomogeneous rates depending on the @xmath127 s and the same two - body boundary condition as occurs when all @xmath128 . despite this evidence",
    ", we do not presently know how to develop a general @xmath127-parameter version of the eigenfunctions and plancherel formula .",
    "one reason why a general @xmath127-version of our present result could be quite enlightening is that we do not have an analog of macdonald processes or @xmath127-parameters in relation to asep and the heisenberg xxz quantum spin chain , and this may help guide that investigation .    in @xcite two discrete time versions of @xmath0-tasep were introduced and studied .",
    "their moments solve discrete variants of the @xmath0-boson particle system evolution equations .",

    "as we deform sequentially the contours in the left - hand side of ( [ qak ] ) to @xmath44 we find that the resulting terms in the residue expansion can be indexed by partitions @xmath81 along with a list ( ordered set ) of disjoint ordered subsets of @xmath1014 ( whose union is all of @xmath1014 ) @xmath1015 let us call such a list @xmath1016 . for a given partition @xmath164 call @xmath1017 the collection of all such lists @xmath1016 corresponding to @xmath164 . for @xmath988 and @xmath1012 , in example [ ex2 ]",

    "there are @xmath83 such strings and consequently that many remaining variables ( though we have only written the first two strings above ) .    with the above notation in place , we may write the expansion of the integral on the left - hand side of ( [ qak ] ) as @xmath1022 the factor of @xmath1023 arose from multiple counting of terms in the residue expansion due to symmetries of @xmath164 .",
    "for example , for the partition @xmath1024 , each @xmath1025 , corresponds uniquely with a different @xmath1026 in which the @xmath193 and @xmath1027 variables in ( [ ijvar ] ) are switched .",
    "since these correspond with the same term in the residue expansion , this constitutes double counting and hence the sum should be divided by @xmath1028 .",
    "the reason why our residual subspace expansion only corresponds with strings is because if we took a residue which was not of the form of a string , then for some @xmath1029 we would be evaluating the residue at @xmath1030 and @xmath1031 .",
    "however , the vandermonde determinant in the numerator of our integrand would then necessarily evaluate to zero .",

    ".    one should observe that the above expression includes the summation over all @xmath297 , and not just those which arise from an @xmath1025 as above .",
    "this , however , is explained by the fact that if @xmath298 does not arise from some @xmath1025 , then the residue necessarily evaluates to zero ( hence adding these terms is allowed ) . to see this , observe that in the renumbering of variables discussed above , only permutations with @xmath1046 participated .",
    "any other @xmath298 must violate one of these strings of conditions .",
    "consider , for example , some @xmath298 with @xmath1047 .",
    "this implies that the term @xmath1048 shows up in the denominator of ( [ above3 ] ) , as opposed to the term @xmath1049 .",
    "residues can be taken in any order , and if we first take the residue at @xmath1050 , we find that the above denominator does not have a pole ( nor do any other parts of ( [ above3 ] ) ) and hence the residue is zero . similar reasoning works in general .",
