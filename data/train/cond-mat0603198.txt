    "the possibility of controlled embedding of quantum impurities , i.e.  local scatterers with internal degrees of freedom , into nanofrabricated devices has led to new manifestations of kondo physics , e.g.  in quantum dot systems or atoms deposited on metallic surfaces@xcite . in these systems",
    "many parameters of the impurity , such as its internal spectrum , its coupling to the metallic environment and the properties of the latter can be tuned within the experiment . investigating the effects of these parameters on observable quantities",
    "leads to various new questions : originally , most of the theoretical work on the quantum impurity problems has neglected the effect of electronic correlations in the host system@xcite .",
    "if the latter is one - dimensional , however , any interaction leads to non - fermi liquid behaviour .",
    "the low energy regime is then described by a tomonaga luttinger liquid ( tll ) characterized by continuously varying exponents of its ground state correlation functions@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the local density of states vanishes as a power law in such a system .",
    "therefore it is to be expected that the critical properties of the impurity will be strongly affected .",
    "this problem of a quantum impurity coupled to a tll has been subject of intense studies in recent years  both analytically based on field theoretical methods and numerically .",
    "these studies indicate that depending on the coupling parameters different non - trivial fixed points at intermediate or strong coupling can be realized which determine the observables accessible to experiments ( see e.g.  refs .  ) .",
    "this picture of the low energy behaviour of these systems has to be supported by methods which do not rely on the analysis at weak coupling , e.g.  exact solutions as for the kondo and anderson impurity problem in a fermi liquid@xcite . for results which cover the full range of experimentally available parameters specific realizations of quantum impurity models",
    "have to be studied .",
    "an approach which allows to make contact to the universal low energy behaviour identified using the methods mentioned above is based on integrable lattice models .",
    "starting , e.g. , from the bethe ansatz solvable supersymmetric @xmath0@xmath1 model for electrons on a one - dimensional lattice or variations thereof one can consider different representations of the graded lie algebra @xmath2 for the spectrum of electronic states on bulk and impurity sites without destroying integrability@xcite .",
    "the physical properties of these impurities can be tuned by variation of the representation ( which may depend on a continuous parameter for @xmath2 ) and by a shift in the spectral parameter which directly enters the coupling between the impurity and the host system .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian of models constructed along these lines takes a particularly simple form when such impurities are combined with open boundaries@xcite . in this paper",

    "the terms in ( [ hamb ] ) describe exchange and coulomb interaction between the electrons on site @xmath14 and those in the chain as well as a term allowing for the hopping of electrons between the bulk and the impurity . comparing this model with that of the single - impurity anderson model",

    "since we consider an open chain , the parameter @xmath0 can be either real positive or purely imaginary , thereby allowing to cover the entire range @xmath21 for this coupling between the bulk and the impurity site .",
    "note that additional parameters can be introduced into the model by adding static boundary fields@xcite .",
    "for generic parameters , however , the @xmath22 contributions of the impurity , boundary and boundary fields to the thermodynamic properties are additive in the integrable model . since the @xmath0@xmath1 model with open boundaries and boundary fields",
    "has already been studied in great detail@xcite we restrict our analysis to the impurity contributions to the magnetization and the susceptibilities .",
    "these are functions of the bulk density of holes @xmath12 , the magnetic field @xmath10 and the parameters controlling the impurity , i.e.  @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore we consider only the ground state properties of the system to avoid the subtleties arising in the analysis of systems with open boundaries at finite temperatures@xcite .    in the following section we identify the configuration of the impurity in the ground state of the many particle system as a function of these parameters .",
    "then we study the magnetic susceptibility and occupation of the impurity at zero magnetic field where we derive analytic expressions near half filling ( @xmath25 ) which are complemented by numerical results for general @xmath12 . based on these results",
    "we identify the relevant energy scales in the system which allow for a quantitative study of the properties of the system in an external magnetic field .",
    "the spectrum of the model ( [ ham ] ) has already been obtained by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz technique@xcite . an eigenstate with @xmath26 electrons",

    "the phases @xmath35 in the second set of these equations are due to the presence of the impurity ( [ hamb ] ) , similarly as in ref .  .",

    "sufficiently strong boundary magnetic fields or potentials lead to the formation of boundary bound states in the spectrum of the system . in terms of the many - particle bethe states",
    "this is reflected by the appearance of isolated , purely imaginary roots to the bae@xcite .",
    "note that a necessary condition for such roots is the existence of singularities in the boundary phase shifts to compensate divergencies appearing in the scattering phases for imaginary rapidities .",

    "increasing @xmath46 beyond @xmath61 does not lead to additional bound states as expected for an impurity with a single orbital allowing for occupation of at most two charges .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the maximum number of bound states allowed to develop themselves upon variation of the hybridization at the boundary impurity site is three - two holons and one spinon .",

    "therefore the impurity does not contribute to the magnetic susceptibility of the system , i.e.  @xmath173 .",
    "for @xmath174 ( regions ( i ) and ( ii ) ) , the occupation is less than @xmath18 due to the filled holon bound state and there is a small finite impurity contribution to the susceptibility .    for @xmath175 , the total number of electrons present at the impurity can become larger than @xmath18 as a consequence of the attractive interaction between the impurity and the bulk electrons for @xmath122 .",

    "i.e.  for @xmath178 the impurity is doubly occupied and essentially decoupled from the host .    the same shift is observed in the resonance of the impurity contribution to the zero - field susceptibility which moves from the threshold for the holon bound state towards smaller values of @xmath24 as the hole concentration is increased .",
    "this resonance is the response of the unpaired electron on the impurity site which appears when @xmath179 .",
    "although still limited by fluctuations in the impurity s occupation the susceptibility at the resonance grows strongly with @xmath12 .",

    "this parameter introduces a scale where the response of the impurity to external fields is expected to change . in the present problem where",
    "the impurity site is coupled to the @xmath0@xmath1 chain with separated spin and charge degrees of freedom this response will depend on the relation of this scale to the typical energies in these sectors as well . first , using the relation ( [ ah ] ) , we obtain the kondo field determining the scale where the susceptibility of an impurity coupled to the spin degrees of freedom changes as @xmath183 for large @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath184 .",
    "note that the dependence of @xmath185 on the hybridization is exponential and not a power - law as found for a kondo impurity in a tll@xcite .",
    "this reflects the absence of backscattering in the integrable impurity model considered here .    on the other hand , as seen from the bae ( [ bae0 ] ) ,",
    "the primary effect of the impurity ( [ hamb ] ) is to induce a phase shift in the charge sector .",
    "hence , the hybridization has to exceed a minimal value below which the impurity is doubly occupied and will not contribute to the magnetic response of the system ( this is different from the anderson impurity model considered by bortz _ et al .",
    "_ where the local orbital can be populated by at most one electron@xcite ) .",
    "finally , for the impurity to be visible in the _ magnetic _ response , spin and charge sectors have to be coupled at the scale introduced by the hybridization .",
