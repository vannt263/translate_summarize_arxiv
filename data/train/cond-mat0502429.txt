    "electronic transport through quantum rings structures has become the subject of active research during the last years .",
    "interesting quantum interference phenomena have been predicted and measured in these mesoscopic systems in presence of a magnetic flux , such as the aharonov - bohm oscillations in the conductance , persistent currents@xcite and fano antiresonances @xcite . also , optical spectroscopy measurements have allowed a determination of the energy spectra of closed semiconducting rings@xcite .",
    "recently , fhrer@xcite reported magnetotransport experiments on closed rings showing the aharonov - bohm effect on the energy spectra .",
    "since the persistent currents in isolated mesoscopic rings were predicted @xcite and posteriorly verified experimentally @xcite , there have been many studied on the single rings and coupled - rings systems .",
    "the persistent currents also have been reported in open systems . in these systems ,",
    "the persistent current magnification effect have been predicted for several authors@xcite .",
    "for instance pareek and jayannavar @xcitereported persistent current magnification in two mesoscopic rings connected to an electron reservoir , yi et al.@xcite find giant persistent currents in open aharonov - bohm rings and bandopadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite obtain persistent current magnification in multichannel mesoscopic ring .    a mesoscopic ring coupled to a reservoir",
    "was discussed theoretically a long time ago by bttiker@xcite , in which the reservoir acts as a source of electrons and an inelastic scatterer .",
    "takai and otha@xcite considered the case where the magnetic flux and an electrostatic potential were applied simultaneously .",
    "the occurrence of persistent currents and the behavior of the electric conductance along a normal metal loop connected to two electron reservoirs was also discussed previously@xcite .",
    "recently wunsch et al .",
    "@xcite find the development of long living states in a single ring coupled to a reservoir and discuss their effect in the persistent currents and the relation with the dicke effect in optics.@xcite    in a previous paper ( ref ) we investigate the conductance and the persistent current of a mesoscopic quantum ring attached to a perfect quantum wire in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we show that the system develops an oscillating band with resonances ( perfect transmission ) and antiresonances ( perfect reflection ) .",
    "in addition , an odd - even parity of the number of sites of the ring was found . with the advances in the fabrication techniques of nanostructures ,",
    "it is natural to propose and study more complex mesoscopic ring - like structures , as a double quantum ring , and to develop a theoretical quantum mechanical description for understanding such these new family of systems . in the present work we address to the study of the transport properties of a system composed by two quantum rings side attached to a quantum wire .",
    "we found persistent current magnification in the rings due to the formation of bound states in the rings when the magnetic flux difference is an integer number of the quantum of flux .",
    "the system under consideration is formed by two n - sites quantum rings connected by tunnel coupling to a quantum wire waveguide of infinity length , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "the rings are threaded by a magnetic field flux .",
    "the full system is modeled by a single - band tight - binding hamiltonian within a noninteracting picture , that can be written as @xmath0 with @xmath1        where @xmath2 is the creation operator of an electron at site @xmath3 of the wire , and @xmath4 is the corresponding operator of an electron in the state @xmath5 of the upper ( @xmath6 ) or lower ( @xmath7 ) ring .",
    "the wire site - energy is assumed equal to zero and the hopping energies for wire and rings are taken to be equal to @xmath8 , whereas @xmath9 couples both systems . in the nearest neighbors approximation",
    "the energy of the state @xmath5 of the ring @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 , is the magnetic flux in unit of elemental quantum flux ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "we calculate the green s function of the site @xmath20 of the quantum wire coupled to the rings , obtaining the following expression : @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is given by the following equation , @xmath25^{-1}.\\ ] ] by considering symmetric couplings @xmath26 and equations 3 - 5 , we evaluate the linear conductance , @xmath27 \\big |_{\\omega=\\varepsilon_f}=\\frac{2e^2}{h } \\frac{1 } { 1+\\gamma^2(q_{1}+q_{2})^2}\\big |_{\\omega=\\varepsilon_f}.\\ ] ]    the density of states of the quantum rings can give us a better understanding of the transport properties of the system . to obtain it",
    "we calculate the spectral function @xmath28 from the imaginary part of the diagonal elements of the green s functions of the rings , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , this is :    @xmath31    then ,    @xmath32    the density of states in each ring is obtained summing over all the states of the corresponding ring :    @xmath33    in the presence of a magnetic flux threading the rings , a persistent current is generated through the circular system .",
    "the persistent current density @xmath34 in the ring @xmath10 , in the energy interval @xmath35 around @xmath36 , is given by    @xmath37    the total persistent current in each ring @xmath10 is obtained integrating the persistent current density over @xmath36 , we can write ,    @xmath38    where @xmath34 is given by eq .",
    "[ pdc1 ] and @xmath39 is the fermi - dirac distribution . in order to study the behavior of the above physical quantities as a function of the relevant flux parameters , we adopt new phases defined in terms of the aharonov - bohm phases @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath43 the conductance can be written as , @xmath44 ^ 2 } { [ ( x+y)(x - y)]^2 + ( \\gamma\\beta)^2x^2 } \\big|_{\\omega=\\varepsilon_f}. \\label{con2}\\ ] ] from these equations we note that the conductance vanishes each time that @xmath45 or @xmath46 are zero",
    ". therefore the conductance will present antiresonances for energies corresponding exactly to the energy spectrum of the isolate rings . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonances in the conductance are obtained when @xmath47 or @xmath48 becomes null , except when @xmath49 is equal to zero which occurs when @xmath50 or @xmath51 , are zero or integer values .",
    "similarly the density of states ( dos ) and persistent current density ( pcd ) can be written in terms of flux parameters as ,    @xmath52}{(x^2-y^2)^2+(2\\gamma\\beta)^2x^2 } \\label{dos2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath53    in the above expressions the upper(lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "these analytical results permit us to analyze its behavior as a function of the different relevant parameters of the system .",
    "we can see that both functions oscillate with the energy and the magnetic flux parameters and that for each ring , dos and pcd vanishes at the eigenenergies corresponding to the other isolated ring , except when @xmath55 . in particular , it can be observed that the pcd in both rings vanishes for the zeroes of @xmath47 ( ec .",
    "[ beta ] ) , i.e. @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "furthermore , the maxima amplitude of the dos and pcd can be obtained from the minimum of the common denominator in the equations [ dos2 ] and [ pcd2 ] , i.e. @xmath58 .    in what",
    "follow we present results for the conductance , density of states , and persistent current of a double ring system of @xmath59 sites , coupled through a wire .",
    "energies are measured in units of the hoping parameter @xmath8 .",
    "notice that all studied physical quantities depend in a completely equivalent form of the flux parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , therefore its can be analyzed as a function of any of them and the wire - ring coupling energy @xmath60 .",
    "for given set of parameters the energy spectrum consists of a superposition of quasi - bound states reminiscent of the corresponding localized spectrum of the isolated rings .",
    "figure 2 displays the linear conductance versus the fermi energy for a coupling energy @xmath61 and parameters of magnetic flux given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( upper layer ) and @xmath64 ( lower layer ) . as expected from the analytical expression ( eq .",
    "[ beta ] ) the linear conductance presents a series of resonances and antiresonances as a function of the fermi energy .",
    "the zeroes in the conductance represent exactly the superposition of the spectrum of each isolated ring @xmath65 . notice that when the difference between both fluxes decreases the shape of the resonances changes drastically and the conductance becomes composed of broad and narrow peaks .",
    "when the magnetic fluxes coincide the isolated - ring spectra are degenerated and the narrow peaks are completely suppressed from the conductance .",
    "we will analyze in detail this situation below .    in figure 3",
    "we have plotted the density of states ( upper plot ) and the persistent current density ( lower plot ) as a function of energy @xmath36 , for @xmath61 and flux parameters given by @xmath62 and @xmath66 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines indicate upper ring and lower ring respectively .",
    "we can see the expected structure of maxima and minima of dos and pcd localized in the energy values defined by the spectrum of each isolated ring .",
    "the wire - rings coupling energy determines the mixing between the states of the two rings and in consequence the width of the peaks in the dos and pcd .",
    "an interesting situation appears when the energy spectrum of both rings becomes degenerated .",
    "this occurs when the magnetic fluxes threading the rings are equals or they are integer multiples one of each other .",
    "this is @xmath67 or @xmath68 , with @xmath69 . for this case @xmath70 , and we obtain ,    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by    @xmath74    the analytical expression obtained for dos clearly shows the presence of n bound states reminiscent of the spectrum of an isolated ring .",
    "it is clear that they do not contribute to the conductance .",
    "bound states appear superposed to the corresponding spectrum of an effective single ring coupling to the quantum wire with coupling energy equal to @xmath75 .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the behavior of the dos as a function of the energy for @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the dos shows the superposition of sharp and broad resonances centered at the same energies .",
    "it is important to note that the above expression are valid only if @xmath77 .",
    "the presence of bound states induces divergences in the persistent current density for energies corresponding to the eigenenergies of the isolated rings .",
    "this affects the behavior of the total persistent current inside the rings which is strongly enhanced for certain values of the parameters as we will see below .",
    "the total persistent current for the case of equals magnetic fluxes , ie .",
    "@xmath76 can be written as :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is given by eq .",
    "[ pcs ] . notice that the persistent current in each ring contains two contributions , one @xmath80 from a single ring with an effective coupling energy @xmath81 and another one @xmath82 , independent of the coupling parameter . in order to evaluate the total persistent current we put the fermi energy at the center of the band i.e. @xmath83 at zero temperature . in figure 5",
    "we illustrate the total persistent current in units of the persistent current of an isolated ring @xmath84 , for different values of @xmath60 . it can be observed that for small values of @xmath60 there is an notable enhancement of the total persistent current in each ring .",
    "we observe that the amplitude of the persistent current is nearly twice the corresponding amplitude of the persistent current of an isolated ring @xmath84 .",
    "this magnification effect is associated with the presence of bound states in the spectrum of the coupled - rings system .",
    "other interesting effect occurs for large values of @xmath60 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath60 increases , the amplitude of the persistent current tends to @xmath84 , this is contrary to the case of a single ring connected to reservoirs for which the amplitude of the persistent current decays to zero for increasing @xmath60 .",
    "we show this effect in figure 6 which displays the amplitude of the total persistent current @xmath85 and the amplitude from the contributions @xmath80 and @xmath82 as a function of coupling parameter .",
    "we see that for @xmath60 sufficiently large the amplitude of @xmath80 tends to zero and the persistent current tends to @xmath84 .",
    "now we examine the cases for @xmath51 taking values close to an integer number . for these cases @xmath86 and the conductance can be written approximately as a superposition of a broad fano line shape and a narrow breit - wigner line shape around @xmath87 with widths @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "this is , @xmath90 this expression clearly shows the superposition of short and long living states developed in the rings .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] displays one of the narrow resonances of conductance for @xmath62 , @xmath91 ( solid line ) and @xmath92 ( dashed line ) .",
    "similarly , the density of states and the persistent current density can be written near @xmath55 in terms of contributions coming from the two kind of states ,    @xmath93    @xmath94    in fig .",
    "8 we show an example of the dos ( fig .",
    "8(a ) ) and the current density ( fig .",
    "8 ( b))as a function of the energy for nearly equals magnetic fluxes , @xmath91 , threading the upper ring ( solid line ) or the lower ring ( dashed line ) . the coupling energy parameter is @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "9 it is shown the total persistent current as a function of the total of magnetic flux for different values of @xmath60 in the regime of nearly equals magnetic fluxes @xmath96 .",
    "the apparition of quasi - bound states in the spectrum of the system is a consequence of the mixing of the levels of both rings which are coupled indirectly through the continuum of states in the wire .",
    "a similar effect was discussed recently in a system with a ring coupled to a reservoir by wunsch et al . in ref .",
    "they relate this kind of collective states with the dicke effect in optics .",
    "the dicke effect in optics takes place in the spontaneous emission of a pair of atoms radiating a photon with a wave length much larger than the separation between them .",
    "@xcite the luminescence spectrum is characterized by a narrow and a broad peak , associated with long and short - lived states , respectively .",
    "we have investigated the persistent current , conductance and density of states in a system of two side quantum rings attached to a quantum wire in the presence of magnetic fluxes threading the rings . in the regime of nearly degenerated isolated rings spectrum , two kind of collective states are developed in the system . states strongly coupled to the wire with an effective coupling twice the coupling of a single ring , and strongly localized states .",
    "we found that when either the flux difference or the sum of the fluxes are close to zero or close to integer multiples of a quantum of flux both , dos and pcd show sharp and broad peaks around the energy corresponding to the eigenenergies of the isolated rings . in the limit when the isolated rings spectrum is completely degenerated bound states are formed in the rings leading to a magnification of the persistent currents in the rings .",
    "we also found that the persistent current keeps a large amplitude even for strong ring - wire coupling .",
    "this is a purely quantum effect , and it is related to the formation of the collective states in the double quantum - ring system .",
