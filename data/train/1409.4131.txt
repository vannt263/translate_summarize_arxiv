    "as atoms in the molecules generally have partial charges , determination of the interfacial properties requires an accurate treatment of the long - ranged coulomb interactions in a slab geometry of two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodicity .",
    "however , it remains a great challenge for theoretical physical chemists to efficiently and accurately treat the long - ranged coulomb interaction when performing molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulation studies for three - dimensional ( 3d ) charged systems with 2d ( e.g. @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions ) periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) and the other dimension ( e.g. @xmath3 direction ) nonperiodic ( see fig .

    "more than 30 years ago , an ewald summation method for 3d charged systems with 2d periodicity was first derived by parry@xcite , by heyes , barber and clarker@xcite and by de leeuv and perram@xcite ( referred as ewald2d method ) . for a system of @xmath4 charged particles ,",
    "the computational cost of ewald2d method carried out over distinct pairs of charges scales as @xmath5 and becomes very expensive when @xmath4 is very large .",
    "many researchers have thus proposed alternative ewald type methods to introduce significant reduction in the computational time @xcite .",
    "hautmann and klein developed a method based on an expansion of ewald2d expression to a taylor series which can be applied to thin layer configurations where the extension in the dimension with no periodicity ( length in @xmath3 direction ) is much smaller than the length of the unit cell in the other two dimensions ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions)@xcite .",
    "for a system of charges with an arbitrary length in the nonperiodic dimension , the first successful method to improve the efficiency of ewald type computation with sufficient accuracy was proposed by yeh and berkowitz@xcite .",
    "their method relates the electrostatic potential of a 3d system of 2d pbc to that of a corresponding 3d system of 3d pbc but with a correction term accounting for the difference between the two boundary conditions ( refered as ewald3dc method ) @xcite .",
    "sufficient accuracy of ewald3dc method can be always obtained by introducing large empty space in the artificial 3d periodic system .",
    "the ewald3dc method has been widely applied to molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulation studies of various interfacial systems in slab geometry ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) . with the same intuition of relating electrostatics in 2d periodicity to that in 3d periodicity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : period2d ] ) , holm and coworkers have further added an electrostatic layer correction term to remove the effect of artificial electrostatic layers in the corresponding 3d full periodic system ( referred as ewaldelc method)@xcite . aside from extending the problem to full 3d periodicity and then correcting the effect of boundary and electrostatic layers , several researchers have sought to rewrite the ewald2d expression in an alternative way in order to obtain better computational scaling @xcite .",
    "notably , recent development by lindbo and tornberg have successfully developed fast and accurate ewald2d techniques which involves a particle mesh type generalization@xcite .",
    "these types of ewald2d summation methods by kawata and mikami@xcite or lindbo and tornberg@xcite start from an equivalent fourier integral expression of the ewald2d formula and apply an interpolation treatment for a term purely depending on @xmath3 and a fast griding treatment for the other part of the fourier integral .",
    "the above development has focused on the exact treatment of the long - ranged coulomb interaction which obviously leads to exact dynamical and structural properties of interfaces . on the other hand , weeks and",
    "coworkers have developed a mean field treatment called local molecular field theory @xcite which directly treats the short - ranged part of the coulomb interaction and maps the effect of the long - ranged part of the coulomb interaction to a mean - field single particle external potential . when combined with a configuration - based linear response theory ,",
    "simulations based on local molecular field theory are able to yield accurate structural and thermodynamic properties with a significant reduction in computation cost@xcite .",
    "however , a controllable way to achieve accurate dynamics has yet to be developed for simulation studies of interfaces in the framework of local molecular field theory .    to efficiently reduce the computational cost and",
    "accurately determine the instantaneous potential and force , the fourier integral expression of the ewald2d formula derived as early as in the work by de leeuv and perram@xcite has been often used as a starting point in the previous developments @xcite . in the present work , we will start from the same fourier integral formula and mathematically analyze how the error can be controlled when approximating the integral formula . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the point of novelty in the present work is threefold .",
    "first , we will suggest a new formulation for the @xmath3 dependent term which might be superior to the previous interpolation methods .",
    "second , we will directly derive the boundary correction and electrostatic layer correction terms from the fourier integral expression .",

    "<S> we present a rigorous ewald summation formula to evaluate the electrostatic interactions in two - dimensionally periodic planar interfaces of three - dimensional systems . by rewriting the fourier part of the summation formula of the original ewald2d expression with an explicit order @xmath0 complexity to a closed form fourier integral </S>",
    "<S> , we find that both the previously developed electrostatic layer correction term and the boundary correction term naturally arise from the expression of a rigorous trapezoidal summation of the fourier integral part . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the exact corrections to the trapezoidal summation in a form of contour integrals offering precise error bounds with given parameter sets of mesh size and system length . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations of madelung constants in model ionic crystals of slab geometry have been performed to support our analytical results . </S>"
