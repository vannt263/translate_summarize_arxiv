    "a major surprise arising from direct detection of gas - giant planets around young stars is that the spectral properties of these objects differ from those of field l  and t  dwarfs .",
    "these young planets have redder near - ir colors , fainter near - ir absolute magnitudes , and peculiar spectra compared to their field analogs . over the last several years , this development has fostered closer scrutiny of the long - standing paradigm that a simple physical sequence connects the lowest mass stars to brown dwarfs to gas - giant planets .",
    "we now know that most field brown dwarfs are not good analogs to young exoplanets .",
    "in contrast to field t  dwarfs of similar temperature , the young planets around hr  8799 and 2mass  j1207@xmath039 have no methane absorption and very red colors .",
    "these properties are thought to arise from extreme atmospheric conditions tied to their young ( @xmath61030  myr ) ages and low gravities , e.g. , enhanced vertical mixing , non - equilibrium chemistry , and unusual clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is corroborated by recent studies of the youngest ( @xmath710100  myr ) field brown dwarfs , which find that low - gravity l  dwarfs also show very red colors and spectral peculiarities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "complicating this interpretation , however , is the existence of very red l  dwarfs that do not show spectral signatures of youth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , similarities between the colors and spectra of field brown dwarfs and young planets can have ambiguous interpretations .",
    "there are two prominent shortfalls in our observational knowledge .",
    "( 1 )  there are only a handful of very red young l  dwarfs currently known ( see compilation in @xcite ) , and only one of them has a parallax measurement @xcite .",
    "( 2 )  most l  dwarfs do not have as red near - ir colors as young exoplanets , and _",
    "none _ are as faint in their near - ir absolute magnitudes .",
    "therefore , the utility of young field objects as exoplanet analogs may be limited , since the existing samples of these two types of objects are small and do not really overlap .",
    "we have found an extraordinary young l  dwarf that will help shed light on these topics .",
    "it is the reddest field object found to date and the first to have absolute magnitudes comparable to directly imaged young dusty exoplanets .",
    "we have been undertaking a search for t  dwarfs using the ps .",
    "( ps1 ) @xmath8  survey  @xcite .",
    "we select objects using ps .   and 2mass based on their colors and proper motions and then obtain near - infrared photometry for further screening .",
    "we observed pso  j318.5338@xmath022.8603  ( hereinafter pso  j318.5@xmath022 ) using wfcam on the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on the 2010 september  15  ut .",
    "conditions were photometric with 0.91.0  seeing .",
    "we found that the @xmath9 color for pso  j318.5@xmath022  was @xmath10  mag ( table  1 ) , significantly redder than any previously known field dwarf .",
    "we obtained @xmath11100 near - ir ( 0.82.5  ) spectra on 2011  july  21  ut from nasa s infrared telescope facility .",
    "( by coincidence , we observed pso  j318.5@xmath022  immediately before obtaining the spectrum of the similarly red l  dwarf wise  j0047 + 68 published in @xcite . ) conditions were photometric with 1  seeing .",
    "we used the near - ir spectrograph spex @xcite in prism mode with the 0.8  slit .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 16  min .",
    "all spectra were reduced using version  3.4 of the spextool software @xcite .",
    "we also used the final spectrum to synthesize near - ir colors for pso  j318.5@xmath022  ( table 1 ) .    to assess the gravity of pso  j318.5@xmath022 , we obtained @xmath12 near - ir spectra using the gnirs spectrograph @xcite on the gemini - north 8.1-m telescope .",
    "cross - dispersed spectra were obtained using the 0.3  slit and the 32  lines  mm  grating on the nights of 2013 june  26 , june  30 , and july  01 ut .",
    "the total integration time was 5400  s. we reduced the data using a version of spextool modified for gnirs cross - dispersed data .",
    "we combined the telluric - corrected spectra from the three nights using a robust weighted mean to produce the final 0.952.5  spectrum .",
    "we conducted astrometric monitoring of pso  j318.5@xmath022  with the facility near - ir camera wircam at the canada - france - hawaii telescope , obtaining 9  epochs over 2.0  years starting on 2011  july  26  ut .",
    "our methods are described in @xcite . using 116 reference stars in the field of pso  j318.5@xmath022 ,",
    "the resulting median astrometric precision per epoch was 4.0mas , and the best - fit proper motion and parallax solution had @xmath13 with 13 degrees of freedom .",
    "we applied a relative - to - absolute parallax correction of @xmath14mas derived from the besanon model of the galaxy .",
    "table  1 gives our astrometry results .",
    "we did not find any objects co - moving with pso  j318.5@xmath022  in our 10@xmath154@xmath1610@xmath154 field of view within a range between 0.6mag fainter and 3.3mag brighter at @xmath3  band .",
    "the colors of pso  j318.5@xmath022  are extreme , with  mag ,  mag , and @xmath17  mag , all being the reddest among field l  dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : colorcolor ] and also see @xcite ) .",
    "such colors are thought to arise from an unusually dusty atmosphere that results from a low surface gravity ( young age ) .",
    "the position of pso  j318.5@xmath022  on the near - ir color - magnitude diagram is similarly extreme , being significantly fainter in @xmath3-band absolute magnitude than field l  dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : colorcolor ] ) .",
    "it coincides with the colors and magnitudes of the directly imaged planets around hr  8799 and 2mass  j1207@xmath039b .",
    "we determine the near - ir spectral type of pso  j318.5@xmath022  using the @xcite system , which provides gravity - insensitive types consistent with optical spectral types . for late - l dwarfs , visual classification in the @xmath3  and @xmath18  bands and index - based classifications with the h@xmath19od index are applicable .",
    "for the gnirs spectrum of pso  j318.5@xmath022 , we visually assign a @xmath3-band type of l9@xmath11 and a @xmath18-band type of l6@xmath11 .",
    "the h@xmath19od index corresponds to l6.0@xmath10.8 .",
    "the weighted mean of these three determinations leads to a final type of l7@xmath11 .",
    "spectral typing of our low - resolution spex spectrum gives the same classification ( table  1 ) .",
    "pso  j318.5@xmath022  shows a triangular @xmath2-band continuum , which is considered a hallmark of youth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite caution that very red l - dwarfs having no signatures of youth ( low gravity ) can display a triangular @xmath2-band shape ( e.g. , 2mass  j2148 + 40 in figure [ fig : spectra ] ) . at moderate resolution , there are other indicators of youth for late - l dwarfs .",
    "our gnirs spectrum displays a weak 1.20  @xmath20 m feh band as well as weak ( 1.14  @xmath20 m ) and ( 1.17 and 1.25  @xmath20 m ) lines , which indicate a low gravity . using the gravity - sensitive indices of @xcite , we classify pso  j318.5@xmath022  as vl - g , which allers & liu suggest correspond to ages of @xmath71030  myr based on the ( small ) sample of young late - m / early - l dwarfs with good age constraints .",
    "altogether , pso  j318.5@xmath022  visually appears most similar to the red l  dwarfs wise  j0047 + 68 @xcite and 2mass  j2244 + 20 @xcite , in accord with the similar spectral types and gravity classifications for these three objects .",
    "allers & liu ( 2013 ) note that objects of the same age and spectral type ( temperature ) can display different spectral signatures of youth , based on 2  young l  dwarfs in the ab  dor moving group .",
    "our new discovery affirms this idea .",
    "the spectra of 2mass  j1207@xmath039b and pso  j318.5@xmath022  are quite different ( figure [ fig : spectra ] ) , despite their similar colors and absolute magnitudes and the fact they may be coeval ( section  [ sec : membership ] ) . pso  j318.5@xmath022  shows a negative continuum slope from 2.122.28  @xmath20 m , whereas 2mass  j1207@xmath039b has a positive slope .",
    "the @xmath2-band continuum of pso  j318.5@xmath022  displays a `` shoulder '' at 1.58  @xmath20 m , whereas 2mass  j1207@xmath039b has a very peaked continuum .",
    "overall , the spectrum of 2mass  j1207@xmath039b appears most similar to that of 2mass  j0355 + 11 ( both objects have near - ir types of l3 vl - g ) , despite their large differences in ages , colors , and absolute magnitudes .",
    "altogether , these comparisons hint that determining relative ages and temperatures from nir spectra may be unexpectedly complex .",
    "to assess the physical parameters , we fit the low - resolution near - ir spectra of pso  j318.5@xmath022  and 2mass  j0355 + 11 with the ames / dusty model atmospheres @xcite and the bt - settl model atmospheres @xcite with two different assumed solar abundances ( [ agss ] and @xcite [ cifist ] ) . since both objects have parallaxes , the scaling factors @xmath21 from the fits provide an estimate of the objects radii . using  minimization , all three sets of models",
    "indicates that pso  j318.5@xmath022  ( @xmath22 ) is 100200  k cooler than 2mass  j0355 + 11 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "bt - settl / agss models give the best fits , with the resulting temperatures being comparable to previous fitting of field l  dwarfs but with both young objects having lower surface gravities ( = 4.04.5  dex ) than field objects ( , though the number of fitted field objects is small ) .",
    "most strikingly , the fitted radii are implausibly small ( @xmath60.8  ) , indicating discord between the data and models even though the quality of fit seems adequate by eye .",
    "a similar radius mismatch occurs in model atmosphere fitting of young dusty planets ( e.g. , @xcite ; cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "there is no radial velocity ( rv ) for pso  j318.5@xmath022 , but we can place modest constraints on its space motion .",
    "published rvs find that low - gravity late - m and l  dwarfs reside in the range of [ @xmath020 , + 25 ]  , with the smaller rv range compared to field objects being expected given the young ages .",
    "figure  [ fig : uvwxyz ] plots the spatial ( @xmath24 ) and kinematic ( @xmath25 ) location of pso  j318.5@xmath022  compared to the young moving groups ( ymgs ) from @xcite . and @xmath26 are positive toward the galactic center , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positive toward the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are positive toward the north galactic pole . ]",
    "its @xmath24 position is coincident with the  pic , tuc - hor , and ab  dor moving groups .",
    "however , the velocity information makes the tuc - hor and ab  dor groups implausible , given the large offset from pso  j318.5@xmath022 .",
    "overall , the match with the  pic  members is excellent , i.e. , the velocity offset between the group and pso  j318.5@xmath022  would be only 3  if pso  j318.5@xmath022  has an rv of @xmath06  .",
    "we also computed the kinematic distance ( @xmath31 ) and angle @xmath32 from @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is an object s distance assuming that its tangential velocity ( as derived from its observed proper motion ) is the same as the mean tangential velocity of a ymg . including the uncertainties in the  picgroup s @xmath25 , pso  j318.5@xmath022  has @xmath33  pc , in good agreement with its parallactic distance .",
    "@xmath32 gives the angle between the object s proper motion and that of the ymg at the object s sky position .",
    "pso  j318.5@xmath022  has @xmath34 , whereas the  pic  members from @xcite mostly have @xmath35  degs . in other words , for pso  j318.5@xmath022  the amplitude and direction of its tangential velocity given its sky location agrees well with the space motion of known  pic  members .",
    "finally , we computed the ymg membership probability using the online calculator of @xcite . given the position and parallax of pso  j318.5@xmath022 , their bayesian method reports a membership probability of 99.9% in the  pic  ymg and 0.01% in the field .",
    "( removing the parallax as an input , their method gives 99.6% and a predicted distance of 22.5@xmath11.6  pc , in good agreement with our parallactic distance . )",
    "the absolute value of this method s probabilities is imperfect , since their input model for the solar neighborhood does not account for the relative numbers of objects in different ymgs and the field .",
    "however , the high probability for pso  j318.5@xmath022  is comparable to the values computed for most of the known  pic  members ( and exceeds the rest of them ) .",
    "the malo et al .",
    "method also does not consider the fact that pso  j318.5@xmath022  is spectroscopically young , which would boost the probability that it is a ymg member rather than a field object ( since most field objects have old ages ) .",
    "pso  j318.5@xmath022 , 2mass  j0355 + 11 , and 2mass  j1207@xmath039b are all moving group members and thus play an important role as `` age benchmarks '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "young , very red l  dwarfs are sometimes ( and confusingly ) described as `` underluminous '' compared to field objects , but we find that the luminosities of young and old field objects are comparable.39b can be described as `` underluminous , '' as its luminosity ( @xmath42  dex ; * ? ? ?",

    "likewise , the spectrum of hr  8799b has been shown to resemble some field dwarfs ( e.g. , 2mass  j2148 + 40 and 2mass  j2244 + 20 by @xcite and 2mass  j2139 + 02 by @xcite ) , yet hr  8799b is much fainter and lower mass .",
    "this strengthens our finding that _ near - ir spectral morphology can not reliably determine the underlying physical properties of very red young objects_.    the temperatures for these two objects are substantially lower then those measured in the same fashion ( using , age , and evolutionary models ) for field l  dwarfs of comparable spectral types .",
