    "stars with initial masses above @xmath2 m@xmath1  are thought to end their lives with the collapse of their core , when a compact remnant is formed ( a neutron star , or a black hole for the more massive stars ) and a powerful explosion expels the outer layers of the star .",
    "this explosion is observed as a supernova ( sn ) .",
    "depending on the degree of stripping of the outer layers before the core collapses , supernovae ( sne ) will have different characteristics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if a massive hydrogen envelope is still present at the time of explosion , h lines dominate the spectrum and h recombination dictates the light curve , and the sn is classified as type ii .",
    "if the star loses its h - rich envelope but the he - rich shell is still present , the sn is called a type ib event @xcite , the light curve is not affected by the recombination of hydrogen , and the spectrum shows strong he lines attributed to non - thermal excitation caused by fast particles produced in the @xmath0ni  @xmath3 @xmath0co  @xmath3 @xmath0fe  decay @xcite",
    ". if the he shell is also lost , the sn only shows lines of heavier elements ( o , mg , si , s , ca , fe ) and is dubbed as a type ic event @xcite .",
    "it is thought that the loss of the outer h and he layers may be a consequence of a stellar wind and/or binary interaction @xcite .",
    "the details of the explosion depend on the kinetic energy , the amount of @xmath0ni  ( i.e. , the sn luminosity ) produced in the explosion , and the zero age main sequence ( zams ) mass of the progenitor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for sne  ii and sne  ib / c , respectively ) .",
    "recent studies suggest that stars more massive than @xmath4 m@xmath1  lose both their h and he shells prior to explosion , produce explosions with isotropic energies exceeding 10@xmath5 ergs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , and are often connected with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "a signature of a high kinetic energy ( more precisely , high kinetic energy per unit mass ) is a spectrum with broad lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) ; in those cases where the total kinetic energy of expansion is shown to indeed be very high , the object has been dubbed a  hypernova .",
    "\" stars of somewhat smaller mass ( @xmath6 m@xmath1 ) that still collapse to a black hole can also produce broad - lined sne  ic but show no grb [ e.g. , sn 1997ef ; @xcite ] . for h - rich sne , on the other hand , very large kinetic energies have not yet been observed . only for sne",
    "ib is there some evidence of unusually high kinetic energies , albeit just from one event [ sn 2008d ; @xcite ] .    here we present optical and near - infrared observations obtained of sn  2003bg in the course of the `` carnegie type ii supernova survey '' ( cats , hereafter ) .",
    "these data reveal that sn  2003bg is one of the first broad - lined sne  iib ever observed .",
    "sne  iib are similar to sne  ib but still show some traces of hydrogen in their early - time spectra , which suggests the presence of a low - mass h layer prior to explosion ; the first known example was sn  1987k @xcite , and it too had high expansion velocities .",
    "the prototypical object of this subclass is sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations .",
    "the analysis of the spectroscopic data and the bolometric light curve are presented in section 3 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "detailed modeling of this supernova based on our data is presented in the accompanying paper by @xcite , confirming the conclusion that sn 2003bg had very high kinetic energy of expansion and thus can legitimately be classified as a hypernova .",
    "sn  2003bg was discovered on 2003 feb .",
    "25.7 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by r. chassagne at ste .",
    "clotilde , ile de reunion , with mag = 15 on an unfiltered ccd frame taken with a 0.30-m automated telescope @xcite .",
    "the sn was located @xmath7 west and @xmath8 south of the nucleus of mcg-05 - 10 - 015 , an sb(s)c galaxy with a heliocentric recession velocity of 1367 km  s@xmath9 obtained from 21-cm neutral hydrogen measurements @xcite . according to chassagne , nothing was visible at the position of the sn on an unfiltered image taken on 2002 nov . 7 with a limiting magnitude of 18.0 .    as soon as we learned of the discovery , we initiated detailed follow - up observations of sn  2003bg at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , as part of the `` carnegie type ii supernova survey . ''",
    "this program was carried out at las campanas observatory during 20022003 with the main purpose to study nearby ( redshift @xmath10 ) sne  ii .",
    "cats used the 1-m swope and 2.5-m du pont telescopes to obtain @xmath11 photometry and the magellan clay telescope for optical spectroscopy .",
    "a total of 34 sne  ii were observed in 20022003 plus a few sne of other types .",
    "a detailed report of the 34 sne  ii is in preparation @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite describing the observational procedures of the `` carnegie supernova project '' ( csp ) , which are nearly identical to those of cats .",
    "in fact , cats was a precursor to the csp initiated in 2004 with the aim to study sne of all types .",
    "the main difference between cats and csp is that the latter uses sdss @xmath12 filters for optical imaging .    a complete journal of the photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained for sn  2003bg",
    "is given in table [ journal_tab ] .",
    "in the remainder of this section , we present the observation procedures , data reductions , and the resulting data .",
    "the optical imaging of sn  2003bg was obtained with @xmath13 johnson - kron - cousins filters using the swope 1-m @xmath14 telescope facility direct ccd camera , the wide field re - imaging ccd camera ( wfccd ) on the 2.5-m @xmath15 du pont telescope , and the low - dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 6.5-m @xmath16 magellan clay telescope , all at las campanas observatory ( lco ) .",
    "a few additional optical images were obtained with the 0.9-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the sn observations started on 2003 mar .",
    "2 and extended through 2004 jan .",
    "15 , covering 320 days of the sn evolution . for galaxy subtraction",
    ", we used images obtained with the direct ccd camera on the 2.5-m du pont telescope on 2004 nov . 11 and 2005 feb .",
    "13 when the sn was no longer visible .",
    "this instrument delivers images with a typical image quality of @xmath17 full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) , thus providing galaxy templates with better image quality than any of the sn+galaxy images .",
    "all of the photometric reductions were performed with customized iraf scripts .",
    "the reductions started with the subtraction of the galaxy templates , which involved ( 1 ) determining the coordinate transformation between the two images and registering the template to the sn+galaxy image , ( 2 ) degrading the point - spread function ( psf ) of the template to that of the sn+galaxy image , ( 3 ) matching the flux scale of the template to that of the sn+galaxy image , ( 4 ) subtracting the modified template from the sn+galaxy image , and ( 5 ) extracting a small box around the sn from the subtracted image and inserting it into the original sn+galaxy image .",
    "as a result of this procedure the sn ended up lying on a smooth background , thus allowing us to reliably measure the sn flux .",
    "the next step consisted of establishing a photometric sequence of local standard stars in the field of sn  2003bg .",
    "for this purpose we employed observations with the swope telescope of @xcite standard stars during eight photometric nights .",
    "figure [ fchart_fig ] shows the sn field and the ten selected stars , and table [ sequence_tab ] lists the average @xmath18 magnitudes for these stars .",
    "sn magnitudes in the standard johnson - kron - cousins system were obtained differentially relative to the comparison stars using psf photometry on the galaxy - subtracted images . for this purpose , we employed all the stars of the photometric sequence to determine an average psf for every ccd image , and we fitted the resulting psf to the sn and the standards to a radius of @xmath19 .",
    "the sky was estimated locally for each star from an annulus centered around the star with an inner radius of @xmath20 and a width of @xmath19 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the sn were converted to the standard system using the following equations :    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    in these equations @xmath13 ( left - hand side ) are the published magnitudes in the standard system @xcite , @xmath25 ( right - hand side ) correspond to the natural - system magnitudes , @xmath26 is the color term , and @xmath27 is the zeropoint for filter @xmath28.-band filter , we used @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 in equation [ v_eq ] . ] for all four optical cameras we employed average color terms determined on multiple nights ( listed in table [ coefficients_tab ] ) , solving only for the photometric zeropoints .",
    "we emphasize that our photometric reductions did not include shutter - time corrections because at the time of cats we did not have an assessment of this effect . while the differential photometry technique is immune to the shutter - time error , the calibration of the local photometric sequence performed with the swope telescope could be potentially affected by this effect since the exposures of the @xcite standards are much shorter than those of the sn field . during the csp survey in 2004 we measured this effect and determined that for the curtain shutter design of the ccd camera on the swope telescope , the error introduced in the photometry is a single constant error across the field amounting to 0.08  s @xcite . for our shortest exposures of the landolt fields ( 3  s ) ,",
    "the neglect of this correction introduces an overestimate of 2.6% in the observed fluxes .",
    "the final error in the calibration of the local standards is certainly much lower than this owing to the fact that the nightly photometric calibrations were derived from @xmath3120 landolt stars , most of which observed with longer exposures .",
    "we thus conclude that neglecting the shutter correction makes the sn appear systematically fainter , but the effect is @xmath32 0.01 mag .",
    "we also note that we did not include ccd linearity corrections for any of our instruments since we lacked such information during cats . after the completion of the project we did carry out such measurements with the swope `` site#3 '' ccd in the course of the csp , and we reached the conclusion that the response of the detector departed 6% from linearity at 23,000 adu  pixel@xmath9 ( 57,500 e@xmath33  pixel@xmath9 ) @xcite . based on that information",
    "we have empirically determined that the effect of neglecting this correction introduces a systematic error in the instrumental magnitudes of @xmath310.005 mag per magnitude unit .",
    "we therefore expect a differential bias in the sn flux with respect to the local standards .",
    "the sign and net error in the sn magnitude will depend on whether the sn is brighter or fainter than the average flux of the local standards . during our follow - up observations , the sn varied in the range @xmath3421.0 mag ( see figure [ photometry_fig ] ) , while the average local standard had @xmath35 mag ( see table [ sequence_tab ] ) , so we expect to overestimate the sn flux by @xmath36 mag around maximum light and underestimate the sn flux by @xmath37 mag toward the end of the campaign .",
    "these corrections are on the same order as the precision of the final photometry , and so we have not applied them .",
    "the resulting @xmath18 magnitudes of sn  2003bg are listed in table [ photometry_tab ] .",
    "the final uncertainty in the sn magnitude was the instrumental error in the psf fit ( assuming a minimum of 0.015 mag ) .",
    "we neglected errors due to the transformation to the standard system since the uncertainties in the color term and zeropoint were well below 0.015 mag .",
    "this table also includes synthetic @xmath38 magnitudes computed from our spectra ( see below for details ) in which case we adopted a conservative uncertainty of 0.1 mag .",
    "figure [ photometry_fig ] shows the @xmath13 light curves , all of which reveal that the sn was caught during an early phase of steep brightening .",
    "we estimate that the sn reached a peak of @xmath39 mag at jd 2,452,716720 ( 2003 mar 1721 ) . this relatively large uncertainty in time",
    "is caused by the fact that the light curve around maximum was not sampled in great detail .",
    "peak brightness was followed by a steep decline of @xmath311.3 mag in 30 days . over the next 150 days the sn showed a slow but steady decline at 0.015 mag day@xmath9 . starting around jd 2,452,970 ( @xmath31252 days past maximum )",
    ", there was an evident increase in the decline rate which might be due to the formation of dust in the sn ejecta , as was the case for sn  1987a @xmath31500 days after explosion @xcite .",
    "the color curves are shown in figure [ color_fig ] . prior",
    "to maximum the sn became gradually bluer in @xmath40 , after which it grew redder in all three colors through jd 2,452,740 . after that the sn became bluer in @xmath40 and redder in @xmath41 .",
    "we obtained @xmath42 images of sn  2003bg with the swope telescope ir camera ( c40irc ) and the wide field ir camera ( wirc ) on the du pont telescope @xcite .",
    "c40irc is equipped with a single @xmath43 pixel rockwell nicmos-3 hgcdte array with a @xmath44 pixel@xmath9 scale , which corresponds to a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath45 .",
    "wirc is equipped with four @xmath46 pixel rockwell hawaii-1 hgcdte arrays forming a @xmath47 square footprint with a @xmath48 center - to - center spacing in the reimaged telescope focal plane .",
    "each array covers a fov of @xmath49 with a @xmath50 pixel@xmath9 scale .",
    "sky flats were taken with c40irc during evening twilight .",
    "dark frames were obtained just after closing the dome at the end of the night .",
    "with wirc we instead obtained dome flats with the dome closed at the end of the night followed by dark frames . with both instruments we observed the sn by taking sequences of dithered exposures ranging between 20  s and 90  s depending on the brightness of the sn .",
    "with c40irc we observed sn  2003bg along with star c1 ( figure [ fchart_fig ] ) in order to conduct differential photometry .",
    "the larger fov of wirc allowed us to include star c1 and a few other field stars . during six clear wirc nights , we observed one to four standard stars from @xcite in order to calibrate star c1 .",
    "the c40irc and wirc reductions consisted of subtracting the dark frames from the flat images and dividing the normalized flats into all the science frames .",
    "every time standard stars were observed with wirc , we measured instrumental magnitudes through a standard aperture of @xmath51 radius @xcite , with a sky annulus @xmath51 to @xmath20 from the star .",
    "we corrected such magnitudes for atmospheric extinction using the canonical values given by @xcite : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "a photometric zeropoint was then derived for each filter , assuming zero color terms since the instrument detector and filters used with wirc are essentially the same as in @xcite .",
    "the photometric transformations derived from these observations were then applied to star c1 . from the six independent measurements we obtained the following average magnitudes : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the values @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite .",
    "we then performed differential photometry of the sn relative to star c1 .",
    "to improve the instrumental precision , we measured aperture photometry of both stars using a small aperture that varied between @xmath61 and @xmath62 depending on the seeing .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were converted to the standard system using the zeropoints derived for each filter from star c1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath42 magnitudes of sn  2003bg are listed in table [ ir_photometry_tab ] .",
    "the final uncertainty in the sn magnitude is the sum in quadrature of the statistical errors in the instrumental magnitudes of the sn and star c1 , and the errors in the standard magnitudes of star c1 . at this point",
    "we have ignored possible errors caused by host - galaxy contamination in the sn aperture because we lack galaxy templates in the ir filters . given the smooth background on which the sn lies",
    ", we believe this error is negligible .",
    "figure [ irphotometry_fig ] shows the resulting ir light curves of sn  2003bg . at these wavelengths",
    "the epoch around maximum brightness was very well sampled .",
    "the sn was found @xmath3115 days before maximum , which occurred at jd 2,452,726 @xmath63 1 with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 mag .",
    "the shapes of the ir light curves are similar to those at optical wavelengths .    in figure [ color_ir_fig ] we present the @xmath67ir colors . in all three colors ,",
    "the sn evolved from blue to red through jd 2,452,740 and then became systematically bluer through the last observations on jd 2,452,900 .",
    "a total of 14 optical spectra were obtained of sn  2003bg .",
    "table [ optspec_tab ] gives a journal of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the majority of our spectra were obtained with the 2.5-m du pont telescope using the wfccd instrument in its spectroscopic long - slit mode .",
    "a 400 line mm@xmath9 blue grism was employed with the tektronix @xmath68 pixel ccd to provide a wavelength coverage of 38009330    at a dispersion of 3.0    pixel@xmath9 . with",
    "the @xmath69 slit width used for the sn observations , this setup gave a fwhm resolution of @xmath316.0   .",
    "on the 2.5-m telescope we also obtained spectra with the las campanas modular spectrograph .",
    "this instrument uses a site @xmath70 pixel ccd with 15 @xmath71 m pixel@xmath9 and a 300 line mm@xmath9 grating ( blazed at 5000   ) .",
    "the resulting spectral coverage is @xmath3137807280    at a dispersion of 2.45    pixel@xmath9 .",
    "a slit width of @xmath61 was used for the sn observations , which gave a fwhm resolution of @xmath317   .    on two occasions we used the 6.5-m magellan clay telescope with ldss-2 .",
    "for these observations , a 300 line mm@xmath9 grism blazed at 5000    was employed , providing wavelength coverage of 36009000    at a dispersion of 5.3   pixel@xmath9 . with a @xmath61 slit , this translates to a fwhm resolution of @xmath72   .",
    "we also obtained a single spectrum using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ? * ) on the keck - i 10-m telescope .",
    "the d560 dichroic beamsplitter was used to split the spectrum near @xmath73   .",
    "the @xmath61 slit combined with the 400 line mm@xmath9 grism blazed at 3400    on the blue side of the spectrograph and the 400 line mm@xmath9 grating on the red side to give resolutions of 7 and 6   , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that , with the exception of the lris spectrum , for none of these spectra did we employ a filter to block second - order light , which means that there could be second - order contamination redward of @xmath316800   . with the wfccd and ldss-2 we observed the sn with the slit aligned along the parallactic angle @xcite to reduce the effects of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "however , owing to a misinterpretation of the observing instructions , with the modular spectrograph we oriented the slit perpendicular to this angle , introducing significant errors in the relative spectrophotometry .",
    "the keck / lris spectrum was obtained at a high airmass ( 4.2 ) with mediocre and variable seeing conditions , and sn  2003bg was partially vignetted by the dome shutter , so the absolute flux scale is highly uncertain .",
    "however , the slit was aligned along the parallactic angle , so the relative spectral shape is reliable .",
    "all of the spectra were wavelength and flux calibrated using comparison lamp and standard - star observations @xcite .",
    "no attempt was made to remove telluric absorption lines , except in the keck / lris spectrum .",
    "figures [ spec1a_fig ] and [ spec1b_fig ] show the series of spectra of sn  2003bg obtained during the photospheric and nebular phase , respectively .",
    "the wavelengths of the spectra were shifted to the sn rest frame using a heliocentric recession velocity of 1367 km  s@xmath9 measured for the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the labels to the left of the spectra indicate the rest - frame days elapsed since explosion [ assumed to be on jd 2,452,695.5 ( feb 25.0 ) based on the spectrum fitting by @xcite ] .",
    "telluric features are indicated with the @xmath74 symbol .",
    "it is evident in these figures that the shape of the two spectra obtained with the modular spectrograph on mar .",
    "31 and sep .",
    "18 differs from that of the remaining spectra owing to the wrong orientation of the slit with respect to the parallactic angle .",
    "we checked the spectrophotometric quality of our spectra by convolving them with the @xmath13 filter passbands described by @xcite and computing synthetic magnitudes .",
    "figure [ color_fig ] compares the @xmath40 , @xmath75 , and @xmath41 synthetic colors ( open circles ) with the colors computed from the observed magnitudes . in general",
    "this comparison reveals very good agreement ( within 0.1 mag ) between the observed and synthetic colors .",
    "the most evident discrepancies occur in @xmath41 ( near jd 2,452,740 ) .",
    "this is not surprising considering that we did not use an order - blocking filter in our observations and , therefore , our spectra must suffer from second - order contamination redward of 6800  .",
    "we note that we excluded from this comparison the two spectra obtained with the modular spectrograph which were not obtained along the parallactic angle .",
    "having checked the relative spectrophotometry of our spectra , we proceeded to combine the synthetic colors with our observed @xmath67 magnitudes ( interpolated to the epoch of our spectroscopy)-band light curve using a third - order polynomial fit to the data around maximum light ] in order to derive @xmath38 synthetic magnitudes and complement the observed light curves .",
    "the resulting synthetic magnitudes are shown with open circles in figure [ photometry_fig ] .",
    "this plot reveals that the spectrophotometry is a very useful complement to the observed light curves , especially before maximum light .",
    "the spectroscopic evolution of sn  2003bg is analyzed in detail in the companion paper by @xcite .",
    "here we present only a brief description of the main lines detected and the deduced velocities .    our first spectrum , obtained on feb .",
    "28 with keck / lris ( see figure [ spec1a_fig ] ) , is characterized by a blue continuum and several broad p  cygni profiles . @xcite",
    "claimed that sn  2003bg was very similar to type ic hypernovae sn 1997ef , sn 1998bw , sn 2002ap , and sn 2002bl , perhaps two weeks after explosion ; we see here that it was actually probably closer to just 3 days past explosion .",
    "although one might be tempted to associate the absorption trough near 6000    with h@xmath76 having an expansion velocity of @xmath3125,000 km  s@xmath9 , the model of @xcite shows that h lines make only a minor contribution at this time ; instead , the 6000    trough is dominated by si  ii @xmath776355 .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that he lines are not easily visible at this time .",
    "in addition to si  ii , there are features produced by fe  ii , co  ii , o  i , ca  ii ( the near - ir triplet ) , and mg  ii .",
    "thus , it can not be concluded that sn 2003bg was a sn  iib based on this spectrum alone .    by mar . 2 , h@xmath76 has appeared and is now comparable to ( and blended with ) si  ii @xmath776355 @xcite .",

    "the spectrum obtained on mar .",
    "4 is generally similar to the previous one .",
    "it reveals the presence of strong , broad h@xmath76 emission with a p  cygni absorption component having an expansion velocity of 17,700 km  s@xmath9 at its minimum ( though still probably an overestimate due to residual blending with si  ii @xmath776355 , which is now weaker than h@xmath76 ) .",

    "both he  i lines have considerably lower velocities than the h lines . the higher velocity of h@xmath76 is the result of saturation in that line .",
    "the weaker balmer lines level off at a velocity of @xmath3110,000 km  s@xmath9 , indicating that h is confined to velocities higher than roughly this value in the ejecta .",
    "the he lines level off at a lower velocity , @xmath317000 km  s@xmath9 , which again indicates confinement of he to velocities higher than this value .",
    "the stratification of both h and he is also confirmed by spectral modeling @xcite .",
    "relative to most sne  ii , sn  2003bg stands out for its high expansion velocity .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the bottom of figure [ vel_fig ] , which compares the h@xmath76 velocity curve of sn  2003bg ( red ) , the type iib sn  1987k [ @xcite ; green ] , the normal type ii - p sn  1999em [ @xcite ; blue ] , and sn  1987a [ @xcite ; magenta ] .",
    "however , note that the initial h@xmath76 expansion velocity of the first known sn  iib , sn 1987k , was also very high : @xcite measured @xmath81 km s@xmath9 in his first spectrum , which was obtained near maximum brightness .",
    "this value is comparable to , or even slightly exceeds , the h@xmath76 expansion velocity of sn 2003bg at a similar phase ( march 12 spectrum , @xmath82 km s@xmath9 ) . also , the velocity of the h@xmath76 absorption minimum in the spectrum of sn 1987k steadily decreased with time , as in the case of sn 2003bg .",
    "had there been pre - maximum spectra of sn 1987k , they may well have shown h@xmath76 expansion velocities approaching @xmath3120,000 km s@xmath9 , close to that of sn 2003bg in the march 2 spectrum .    the rapid expansion of sn  2003bg suggests that the kinetic energy per unit mass is high . when the bolometric light curve ( see sec .",
    "3.3 ) is taken into account , the models of @xcite show that the explosion kinetic energy is also very large .",
    "we conclude that ( 1 ) broad - lined spectra are not exclusive to sne in which hydrogen is absent , and ( 2 ) sn 2003bg is the first known sn  ii `` hypernova . ''",
    "our series of spectra obtained during the nebular phase is shown in figure [ spec1b_fig ] and covers the period 176301 days after explosion . during this timespan",
    "the evolution of sn 2003bg was slow .",
    "the most prominent features are forbidden lines such as the [ ca  ii ] @xmath787292 , 7324 and [ o  i ] @xmath786300 , 6363 blends , with a fwhm of @xmath315000 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "weaker emissions due to [ s  ii ] , mg  i ] , [ fe  ii ] , and [ c  i ] are also present .",
    "there is no clear evidence for broad h@xmath76 emission from the sn .",
    "these late - time spectra are typical of sne  ib / c such as sn  1987 m @xcite .",
    "thus , sn  2003bg is a transitional sn  iib , similar to sn  1993j @xcite , although with much greater initial expansion velocities than the latter .      in this section",
    "we derive intrinsic properties of sn  2003bg such as absolute magnitudes and the bolometric light curve .",
    "the first step involves correcting the observed magnitudes for galactic extinction , for which we adopt @xmath83 mag @xcite and the standard reddening law ( @xmath84 ) given by @xcite .",
    "the second step corrects the magnitudes for redshift - related effects ( k - terms ) .",
    "we use the definition appropriate for photon - counting systems given by @xcite , our spectra corrected for galactic extinction ( excluding the data obtained with the modular spectrograph ) , and the @xmath13 filter passbands described by @xcite .",
    "the resulting k - terms for @xmath85 km  s@xmath9 are shown in figure [ kcorr_fig ] as a function of jd .",
    "given the small redshift , the k - terms are small and exhibit a slow variation with time .",
    "we use the cubic polynomial fits shown in this figure to interpolate the k - terms to the time of our optical photometry . the lack of ir spectra , on the other hand , prevents us from k - correcting our @xmath86 magnitudes of sn  2003bg .",
    "we believe the error introduced must be small owing to the small redshift of the sn .",
    "the third step involves correcting the magnitudes for host - galaxy extinction .",
    "examination of our spectra reveals no presence of interstellar absorption lines of na  i  d and ca  ii h & k at the redshift of the galaxy , suggesting no significant extinction .",
    "thus , we neglected such correction .",
    "the fourth and last step is to assume a distance modulus , for which we adopt @xmath87 mag @xcite .",
    "figure [ absmag_fig ] displays the resulting absolute magnitudes as a function of rest - frame days since explosion ( assumed to be on jd 2,452,695.5 ) .",
    "the absolute peak @xmath67 magnitude of @xmath88 does not stand out compared with other core - collapse sne . since the light curve is powered by the @xmath0ni @xmath3 @xmath0co @xmath3 @xmath0fe decay chain",
    ", this luminosity implies that the amount of ni synthesized in the explosion was not particularly large , despite the high expansion velocities shown by sn  2003bg .",
    "bolometric magnitudes at day 15 and between days 37 and 210 ( figure [ bollc_fig ] ; circles ) were calculated using our @xmath89 photometry . a spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "was built for each epoch after converting the observed broad - band magnitudes into monochromatic fluxes , using the conversion factors and effective frequencies of @xcite .",
    "the sed was then integrated to obtain the bolometric flux .",
    "no bolometric magnitude was estimated in the @xmath13 data gap ( between days 15 and 37 ) , where the light maximum must lie . before day 15",
    ", only the ranges of bolometric fluxes were given ( vertical lines ) .",
    "the lower limits were derived by integrating @xmath13 fluxes only , while the upper limits were found by adding the same amount of nir contribution as at day 15 ( @xmath31 25% ) . both",
    "were then shifted by an extra @xmath90 mag to account for some @xmath91-band contribution which is possibly @xmath92 for a sn ib / c @xcite . since at late times the nir flux percentage increases as a sn evolves , the value at day 210 ( 34% ) was used for any later epoch to get the lower bolometric limit . for the late - time upper limits",
    ", we took the most conservative approach of assuming a @xmath0co decay law from day 210 onward .",
    "the resulting luminosities are listed in table [ bol_tab ] .",
    "figure [ bollc_fig ] shows the @xmath93 bolometric light curve of sn  2003bg ( red circles and verticle bars ) , compared with those of other types of core - collapse sne ( ii - p , iib , ic unrelated to grb , and grb - related ic ) . near maximum ,",
    "sn  2003bg was nearly 1.5 dex fainter than the grb - connected type ic sn  1998bw [ black solid line , @xcite ] , and similar in luminosity to the type ic sne  1997ef [ dark yellow squares , @xcite ] and 2002ap [ blue dotted line , @xcite ] , both of which were hypernovae not associated with grbs .",
    "this suggests a normal ( 0.10.2 m@xmath1 ) ni production in sn  2003bg , relative to other hypernovae not associated with grbs . at late times , however , sn  2003bg appears as luminous as sn  1998bw and much brighter than sn  2002ap .",
    "relative to all of these objects , sn  2003bg stands out for its broad light curve , a possible indication of a larger than normal ejecta mass .",
    "compared to the non - hypernova type iib sn  1993j [ green dashed line , @xcite ] , sn  2003bg was more luminous , especially at late times .",
    "the light curve is very different in shape and brighter than that of the typical type ii - p sn  1999em [ magenta stars ; @xcite ] .",
    "our early - time spectroscopic observations of sn  2003bg revealed the presence of balmer lines .",
    "the nebular - phase spectra , on the other hand , showed a remarkable spectroscopic resemblance to type ib / c events , without clear evidence for hydrogen .",
    "these observations and the corresponding modeling of @xcite indicate a progenitor star with a hydrogen shell containing only @xmath310.05 m@xmath1 , similar in mass to the type iib sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "this picture is consistent with the radio model of @xcite , which implies a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) caused by the large mass - loss rate from the progenitor .",
    "@xcite proposed that the bumps in the radio light curve of sn 2003bg were due to a variable wolf - rayet ( wr ) wind , but no physical mechanism for such variations was proposed . but @xcite instead suggested that these episodic bumps could be due to a variable wind of a luminous blue variable star ( lbv ) with a recurrence timescale of @xmath3125 years , qualitatively similar to the modulations seen in the hypernova sn 1998bw .",
    "the transitional character of sn  2003bg as a type iib supernova reported here implies a rather limited amount of h , consistent with an lbv scenario , as lbv atmospheres are h - rich compared with wr stars , but he - rich compared to ob stars and red supergiants @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocities inferred from the balmer lines were initially at the level of 20,000 km s@xmath9 , though closer to 14,000 km s@xmath9 near maximum brightness ; this is almost unprecedented for sne  ii ( the notable exception being sn  iib 1987k ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first spectra bear resemblance to the broad - lined sne  ib and sne  ic such as sn  1997ef .",
    "this suggests a larger than normal kinetic energy per unit mass for a type ii event .",
    "in fact , when the bolometric light curve is taken into account , the total kinetic energy of the ejecta is found to be large ; the models of @xcite yield @xmath94 ergs , which is well above that of normal core - collapse sne ( @xmath95 ergs ) although definitely less than that of the grb - related sn  1998bw .",
    "thus , sn  2003bg can be described as the first known type iib hypernova .",
    "near maximum brightness , sn  2003bg displayed a luminosity comparable to that of other grb - unrelated type i hypernovae , implying a rather normal amount of @xmath0ni production ( 0.10.2 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the light curve of sn  2003bg , on the other hand , is remarkably broad , thus suggesting a relatively large progenitor mass at the moment of explosion .",
    "in fact , the models in the accompanying paper by @xcite find that sn  2003bg ejected @xmath314  m@xmath1   of material .",
    "this value , combined to the evolutionary models of @xcite suggests a zams mass for the progenitor star of @xmath312025 m@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty on these values depends primarily on the uncertain amount of mass loss the star suffers during its evolution , which can affect the growth of the he core .",
    "these conclusions are qualitatively consistent with the mass - energy relation reported in the literature for core - collapse sne ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for sne  ii and sne  ib / c , respectively ) .",

    "<S> the bolometric light curve of sn  2003bg , on the other hand , is remarkably broad , thus suggesting a relatively large progenitor mass at the moment of explosion . </S>",
