    "the typical size of regions which acquire different vacuum expectation values depends on the type of phase transition but it can never exceed the horizon size , due to causality .",
    "the specific defect formed in turn depends on the symmetry of the groups involved , in particular on the homotopy group of the vacuum manifold .",
    "if the vacuum manifold contains disconnected parts domain walls are formed , if it contains unshrinkable loops strings are formed and if it contains unshrinkable spheres monopoles are formed .",
    "more complicated hybrid defects may be formed if there is more than one phase transition . for",

    "the most simple phase transition where cosmic strings are produced is @xmath0 the vacuum manifold is @xmath1 , which contains unshrinkable loops .",
    "the phase transition , occurring at energy @xmath2 , traps the magnetic flux of the gauge fields associated with the @xmath1 symmetry into strings of mass per unit length @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting system is a network of long strings and closed loops .",
    "numerical simulations and analytic studies show that this network quickly evolves into a `` scaling regime '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) , where the energy density of the string network is a constant fraction of the radiation or matter density and the statistical properties of the system such as the correlation lengths of long strings and average sizes of loops scale with the cosmic time @xmath4 . the question of the size of the small - scale structure of cosmic string networks , however , has so far resisted concordance .",
    "simulations show that most loops and the wiggles on the long strings have the smallest possible size , the simulation resolution . however , the prevailing opinion on this issue is that the size of small - scale structure also scales with the cosmic time @xmath4 and its value is given by the gravitational back - reaction scale @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a number of order 100 and @xmath7 is newton s constant .",
    "this possibility was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings have been a popular choice in the literature because unlike monopoles and domain walls they do not cause cosmological disasters .",
    "indeed , they originally were considered good candidates for structure formation .",
    "recent cosmological data , in particular the cosmic microwave background power spectrum , is not consistent with density fluctuations produced only by strings .",
    "a combination of density fluctuations produced by inflation and strings is possible , and strings with small values of @xmath8 would have little gravitational effect .",
    "cosmic strings are also good candidates for a variety of interesting cosmological phenomena such as gamma ray bursts @xcite , gravitational wave bursts @xcite and ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "however , some of the predictions of these models depend sensitively on the so far unresolved question of the size of the small - scale structure .    sakellariadou @xcite computed the radiation from a cosmic string with helical standing waves , which one can consider to be composed of excitations of equal wavelength traveling in the two directions .",
    "hindmarsh @xcite calculated the radiation from colliding wiggles of different wavelengths on a straight string , in a low - amplitude approximation , and found that the radiation rate from small wavelength wiggles approached a constant as the wavelength of the wiggles in the opposite direction became large .",
    "however , garfinkle and vachaspati @xcite showed that a wiggle moving on a straight string does not radiate .",
    "this poses a puzzle because an excitation of sufficiently large wavelength would seem to appear straight to a tiny wiggle passing over it .    with this work",
    "we hope to shed some light on these issues .",
    "the following section contains a review of string motion and a derivation of the energy emitted in the form of gravitational radiation per unit solid angle .",
    "section 3 starts with a derivation of the power emitted from infinite planar excitations on a string with a subsequent specialisation to sinusoidal wave - trains in the case where the amplitude is small .",
    "we show that in the similar wavelength case the result of hindmarsh @xcite applies and how an argument on the limit on the size of the small - scale structure consistent with @xcite can be obtained from this result .",
    "we then demonstrate that this argument can not generally be made and in particular show that when the wavelengths are very different the radiation vanishes exponentially . in section 4 , we discuss these results and their relevance to the question of the small - scale structure in cosmic string networks and conclude with some remarks on the effect of these results on cosmological phenomena .",
    "when the typical length scale of a cosmic string is much larger than its thickness , @xmath9 , and long - range interactions between different string segments can be neglected , the string can be accurately modeled by a one dimensional object .",
    "such an object sweeps out a two dimensional surface in space - time referred to as the string world - sheet .",

    ".      if @xmath79 and @xmath80 are similar in magnitude , and @xmath81 , then the arguments of both bessel functions will be much less than 1 . in this case",
    "we can use the small - argument approximation for the bessel functions @xcite , @xmath82 and so we see that the dominant contribution to ( [ fullpow ] ) comes from the @xmath83 mode , and the power can be written @xmath84    integrating over @xmath85 yields @xmath86 this agrees with the result of @xcite .",

    "wiggles are exponentially suppressed .    if we extend this analysis to a loop , the structure of the loop that enables it to be closed must involve features whose amplitude is comparable to their wavelength , so the condition @xmath96 is always met .    however , it turns out that ( [ hindmarshpow ] ) is never correct in the regime of ( [ badapprox ] ) with @xmath99 .",
    "even @xmath100 is not sufficient , because we might have , for example , @xmath101 , and then the argument of @xmath102 in ( [ fullpow ] ) would not be small .",
    "explicitly , @xmath103 so @xmath104 is at most of order @xmath105 and thus we are in the small - argument regime whenever @xmath106 larger values of @xmath72 and @xmath107 could in principle make the arguments of the bessel functions larger , but it turns out that in this situation the contribution is dominated by that of the lowest mode",
    ".    one can write ( [ goodapprox ] ) in terms of the wavelengths of the sinusoids , @xmath108 and their amplitudes , @xmath109 , as @xmath110 which is invariant under lorenz boosts along the string .",
    "rather than merely requiring that the amplitude of each wave train be small compared to its own wavelength to have the simple case , we must require that each amplitude be small as compared to the geometric mean wavelength .",
    "note that these conditions can not hold if @xmath111 and @xmath99 . as an example of this , in the case of small `` chiral '' wiggles ( those moving in one direction only ) on a loop ,",
    "the conditions ( [ goodapprox ] ) do nt hold and we expect wiggles to survive on the loop longer than ( [ typicaltime ] ) .    it should be noted that if both of the wiggles have about the same wavelengths then an argument analogous to the one above can be made @xcite . in this case",
    "wiggles in both directions contribute to the radiation power , and the extra energy in the string declines as @xmath112 .      in the following",
    "we take the small argument limit for the @xmath77 part of ( [ fullpow ] ) , namely @xmath113 , or @xmath114 , but do not use that approximation for the @xmath115 part of the expression .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where the opposing excitations have very different wavelengths .",
    "thus ( [ fullpow ] ) becomes @xmath116    for @xmath117 , the bounds ( [ generalsumlimits ] ) become @xmath118 which using ( [ deltaapprox ] ) can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120    let us first consider what happens to the @xmath121 mode as @xmath79 approaches the limit in ( [ kappaamax ] ) . in this limit , @xmath122 becomes @xmath123 , while @xmath124 and @xmath79 approach fixed , finite values .",
    "thus @xmath125 , we can take the small argument limit of the bessel function and the power in this mode approaches a finite value given by ( [ hindmarshpow ] ) .",
    "when @xmath79 exceeds the limit of ( [ kappaamax ] ) , the @xmath121 mode vanishes suddenly , causing a discontinuity in the emitted power as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , if we let @xmath126 approach the limit given by @xmath127 , we see that the power in the @xmath121 mode is again given by ( [ hindmarshpow ] ) , which increases with @xmath128 until it suddenly vanishes .    as @xmath79 decreases ,",
    "the modes successively vanish ( although only the energy in the @xmath121 mode does so discontinuously ) , but the remaining modes that are far from the limiting wave number grow larger . to see the overall effect",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath129 , or in terms of the amplitude @xmath130 , so that many different modes contribute to the total radiation .    in appendix",
    "[ appendix : besselapprox ] we use the large - order approximation for bessel functions to compute the power ( [ powbess ] ) in this regime .",
    "we find that the power declines exponentially with @xmath131 , @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "thus there is essentially no radiation from wiggles of significant amplitude and very different wavelengths .    to compare the analytic approximation ( [ coolestpowerever ] ) with our original expression ( [ powbess ] ) , in figure [ fig : fit ] we show a plot of @xmath134 versus @xmath135 with @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath61 fixed .",
    "the dashed line is @xmath138 with a best - fit value @xmath139 , and @xmath140 as above .",
    "the points are given by the sum over @xmath72 and numerical integration over @xmath141 of ( [ powbess ] ) .",
    "in the large @xmath131 regime , we see that the agreement with the analytic approximation is excellent .",
    "the exponential suppression we have just found is valid when the lorentz invariant conditions @xmath142 are satisfied .",
    "it is interesting to consider the effect of a lorentz boost that makes both wiggle wavelengths similar .",
    "this boost makes the condition ( [ absaal ] ) for @xmath143 read @xmath144 . in this case",
    "we could not have performed the calculation at all because this is not the regime in which ( [ amusubnapprox ] ) is a valid approximation .",
    "it must be true , however , because of lorentz invariance , that the radiation is also exponentially suppressed .",
    "although at first glance this may seem puzzling , it is not too difficult to understand this result : in this limit , even though the wavelengths are similar , the amplitude of one of the wave trains is much larger than the other ( @xmath145 ) so that the larger wave - train appears to be traveling on an almost straight string and would not be expected to radiate @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the power radiated in the form of gravitational waves from oppositely moving excitation wave - trains in the small amplitude regime when the wavelengths are comparable and when they are very different .",
    "we have shown that small opposing excitations on strings will only radiate significantly if their wavelengths are comparable . in this case",
    "we can always use ( [ hindmarshpow ] ) for the power and the extra energy in the form of wiggles decreases as @xmath112 as discussed in the literature @xcite .    if , on the other hand , the wavelengths are very different then the gravitational radiation can be suppressed .",
    "if the amplitude @xmath143 of the long - wavelength excitations is greater than the geometric mean wavelength , @xmath146 , then the radiation rate is exponentially small .",
    "thus unless the amplitude of the long - wavelength excitations is very small compared to their wavelength , there is little interaction between modes of very different wavelengths .",
    "the situation where the two wavelengths are very different occurs in loops with chiral wiggles , i.e. , when the wiggles are only on the right- or left - moving excitations . in this case",
    "because the radiation vanishes exponentially the wiggles may be very long - lived .",
    "we therefore expect that if the loop is originally in a stable ( non self - intersecting ) trajectory it will radiate and shrink until it self - intersects , at the latest when the string loop is the same size as the wiggles living on it .",
    "this may take a long time because the tension on the strings is reduced by the presence of wiggles and the motion may be slow @xcite .",
    "when an excitation travels on an infinite string , it will eventually be exposed to every possible sort of excitation going the other way , and will thus eventually lose its energy by gravitational radiation .",
    "however , when an excitation travels on a loop , it will encounter the same oppositely moving excitations over and over again .",
    "it is possible that when a loop is formed there will be , by chance , an excess of ( say ) right - going energy over left - going energy over a broad range of wavelengths . in this case",
    ", energy will be radiated until the left - going excitations have been eliminated and some energy still remains in the right - going ones .",
    "thus the string may become chiral with respect to a certain range of wavelengths , and the chiral wiggles in this range may then become long - lived .",
    "this process is quite complicated , and we will not try to analyze it here .",
    "we merely note that certain initial conditions may lead to long - lived chiral wiggles over certain wavelength ranges , and we briefly investigate the consequences of such excitations .",
    "almost all proposals for cosmic - string - induced astrophysical phenomena are related to cusps .",
    "these are regions of the string that achieve extremely high lorentz boosts @xcite .",
    "therefore here we will focus on the effects that the existence of small wiggles may have on cusps .",
    "near a wiggly cusp the effective mass per unit length is @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the amplitude to wavelength ratio of the wiggles and @xmath149 is the ( transverse ) lorentz boost .",
    "if we think of the string as having a thickness due to the wiggles then before the cusp can be formed the wiggles will typically overlap when the gamma factor reaches the value @xcite @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the size of the loop on which the cusp appears , @xmath152 is the effective thickness due to the wiggles and @xmath153 is the wiggle wavenumber .",
    "the cusp may also not form at all if there is sufficient back - reaction from the wiggles to deviate from regular nambu - goto motion of the string , namely when the gamma factor in ( [ mueff1 ] ) reaches the value @xmath154 which of the two processes is the dominant one depends on which one of the two gamma factors is the smallest , since it will be the one reached first by the cusp .",
    "it follows from this that there are two distinct wiggliness regimes .",
    "if @xmath155 , or @xmath156 , there is not much change in the effective mass of the string and the wiggles will not significantly affect the string motion .",
    "however , before the cusp can be formed , because of the overlap of the wiggles , we will typically have a self - intersection that chops off a loop of size @xmath157 which in turn will fragment into about @xmath158 loops of the wiggle size @xmath159 .    if , on the other hand , @xmath160 , or @xmath161 , we are in the situation where the back - reaction is important .",
    "much work has gone into understanding the behaviour of strings in this regime @xcite .",
    "typically one averages the string over scales larger than the wiggle size and the effect is to increase the effective mass density and decrease the tension of the string .",
    "the situation is then remarkably similar to that of a superconducting string with a chiral neutral current and we expect the cusp in this case to be smoothed out and self - intersections to occur near it some of the time as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can try to estimate the number of cusps formed in both cases .",
    "if we consider the section of the unit sphere where a wiggly @xmath162 and a straight @xmath163 intersect , as in figure [ fig : wigglya ] , we can see that the number of crossings must be @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the length available for crossings in the section where the @xmath162 and @xmath163 intersect on the unit sphere and @xmath166 is the distance between peaks on the unit sphere .",
    "typically @xmath167 is the wavelength of the wiggles and @xmath151 is the size of the loop .",
    "taking @xmath168 gives @xmath169 for the number of cusps .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is also the quantity that determines whether we are in the overlap or back - reaction regime .",
    "this means that in the overlap case there will still be one cusp , just as in the case where there are no wiggles . as we have argued , however",
    ", self - intersections due to overlap will take place before the cusp can be fully formed .",
    "in the back - reaction dominated case instead of a large cusp we will have about @xmath170 small cusps on the smoothed out curve . in figures [ fig : cusp1 ] and [ fig : cusp2 ] we plot pictures of burden loops onto which we have superimposed chiral helical wiggles in the @xmath171 case .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from this analysis",
    "it appears that wiggly cosmic string cusps may solve some of the problems currently faced by cosmic - string - induced astrophysical phenomena .",
    "wiggly cusps could produce substantially more ultra - high energy cosmic rays because of the presence of many small cusps .",
    "gamma ray bursts may not be repeated because of self - intersections near the cusp .",
    "gravitational wave bursts may be more frequent since , like cosmic rays , most of the energy comes from a small area around the cusp .",
    "finally , wiggles may also lead to fine structure in gravitational wave and gamma ray bursts .",
    "although some of these require different wiggliness regimes and would appear mutually exclusive in fact they are not ; we can `` have it both ways '' because as we have shown modes of different wavelengths barely interact and as a consequence chirality can be independently established at different wavelengths .",
    "we would like to thank alex vilenkin , j. j. blanco - pillado , allen everett and larry ford for many useful discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank the referees of nuclear physics b for their careful reading of the manuscript and useful suggestions .",
    "the work of kdo was partially funded by the nsf .",
    "in this appendix , we go from ( [ weinberggravradforstrings ] ) , which gives the energy radiated from a localized interaction , to the power per unit length for an infinite periodic source . to do this",
    ", we consider a wave train of length @xmath151 in @xmath89 and another of length @xmath172 in @xmath88 , and then let @xmath151 and @xmath172 go to infinity",
    ". the resulting energy will be proportional to @xmath173 , as shown below .",
    "we will ignore any contributions coming from the ends of the wave trains , because these will not be proportional to @xmath173 .",
    "thus we will take @xmath174 to be an odd periodic function in @xmath175 , for @xmath176 periods of length @xmath177 ( with @xmath178 ) centered around @xmath179 , and @xmath180 outside this range . since @xmath174 is odd , all components of @xmath181 will be real and ( [ weinberggravradforstrings ] ) becomes @xmath182    because we are interested only in terms proportional to @xmath173 , we exclude the contribution of the straight parts of the string to the integral in ( [ amuofk ] ) , and write this equation as @xmath183 now @xmath184 is periodic , and so @xmath185 is a constant independent of @xmath37 .",
    "thus @xmath186 where @xmath187 with @xmath188    the sum in ( [ amuofkplus ] ) is @xmath189 with @xmath190 .",
    "this function has peaks of height @xmath176 whenever @xmath191 is an integer multiple of @xmath192 and in the vicinity of these peaks the function is effectively @xmath193 .",
    "however , because what appears in ( [ weinberggravradforstringssimple ] ) is the square of @xmath87 what we actually need to evaluate is @xmath194 . in the large @xmath176 limit",
    "@xmath195 so we can write its square as @xmath196    a similar set of expressions can be written for @xmath39 which allow ( [ weinberggravradforstringssimple ] ) to be re - written as @xmath197 where @xmath198    all the variables with the @xmath199 subscript have the obvious meaning and @xmath200 .",
    "the sum in ( [ weinberggravradforstringsmoresimple ] ) is performed for positive values of @xmath72 and @xmath107 only since @xmath201 and @xmath202 are nonnegative .",
    "we can now use the @xmath203 functions to perform the integral in ( [ weinberggravradforstringssimple ] ) over @xmath124 and to integrate over @xmath122 .",
    "we do this by a suitable change of variables , namely , @xmath204 so that @xmath205    upon integration we get @xmath206 where the vector @xmath207 and there is a similar expression for @xmath208 . dividing ( [ dedphi ] ) by the volume of the world sheet where the interaction occurs , @xmath209 , yields the power per unit length per unit azimuthal angle @xmath85 @xmath210    keeping the above in mind we can see that the significance of the appearance of the @xmath211 functions is that for periodic sources the radiation is only emitted in discretized directions and frequencies .",
    "explicitly , for a set of given @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 we have that @xmath214 this discreteness in frequencies and angles arises from the temporal and spatial periodicity of the system .    if we had @xmath215 , then the right hand side of ( [ costhetaappendix ] ) would always lie between -1 and 1 .",
    "however , for waves of finite amplitude , this is not the case and thus not all modes are present .",
    "this limitation restricts the sum over @xmath72 and @xmath107 to satisfy @xmath216",
    "in this appendix , we compute an analytic approximation to the radiation power ( [ powbess ] ) using the bessel function approximation for large order @xcite @xmath217 which is valid when @xmath218 .        in our case it is easy to see that @xmath224 has",
    "a maximum at @xmath225 and the value of the function at this peak is @xmath226 .",
    "this means that @xmath227 is at most @xmath228 and thus @xmath229 is at least @xmath230 , and we see that ( [ bessapprox ] ) is indeed a good approximation .",
    "we will now perform the sum over @xmath72 . to do the calculation",
    "analytically we must first approximate the sum by an integral , which we can do provided the values of the function are sufficiently close to one another in the region in which we are performing the sum .",
    "secondly , we will assume that the largest contribution to the bessel function comes from a maximum and that we can approximate that integral by multiplying the height at the peak times the width of this peak at the maximum @xmath231 this will be a reasonable approximation provided the function is sufficiently smooth around the maximum . below",
    "we show that this condition is satisfied",

    "if the factor of @xmath72 were not present , we would reason that since @xmath239 is a decreasing function of @xmath240 , and @xmath241 is also a decreasing function of @xmath240 , then the right hand side not counting the @xmath72 is an increasing function of @xmath224 , and ( [ lnj ] ) will have its maximum where @xmath224 has its maximum .",
    "since the right hand side is negative , and also a decreasing function of @xmath72 , we can infer that the actual value of @xmath72 that maximises ( [ lnj ] ) is actually less than the one that maximises @xmath224 .",
    "we can thus write @xmath242 and @xmath243 setting the derivative of ( [ lnjsimsech ] ) to zero gives @xmath244    this equation can be solved ( although not analytically ) for @xmath245 , the value of @xmath224 that maximises ( [ lnj ] ) for a particular @xmath246 and from it , using ( [ nxpc ] ) , one can obtain @xmath247 , the value of @xmath72 at the maximum of ( [ lnjsimsech ] ) .",
    "note that both values will be in general different from @xmath248 and @xmath249 , the maximum of @xmath72 and @xmath224 at the maximum of the function @xmath224 .",
    "figure [ fig : zm ] shows a plot of @xmath250 , the maximum of ( [ lnj ] ) , as a function of @xmath251 . as expected the value of @xmath227 where ( [ lnj ] ) is at a maximum is slightly less than the maximum value of @xmath227 .    in order to estimate the width at the peak we can again use ( [ lnj ] ) .",
    "however in this case we can use the width at the maximum of the function @xmath252 , i.e. , at @xmath237 , or @xmath253 , because it is sufficiently close to the maximum of @xmath254 .",
    "this simplifies the calculation considerably . from ( [ lnj ] )",
    "one can see that @xmath255 and we can compute the width using the taylor expansion @xmath256 taking @xmath257 we find @xmath258      as advertised above , since @xmath264 is large in the small @xmath79 limit , the function around the maximum is sufficiently smooth that we can now perform the sum by approximating it as an integral and further approximating this integral by multiplying the value of the function at the peak by the width near the peak @xmath259 .      the integral over @xmath85 can be approximated in an analogous way , taking the value of the bessel function at the peak , which is at @xmath266 , and finding the width at this peak . evaluating the function at the maximum is straightforward , one simply needs to solve ( [ nastycondition ] ) for @xmath267 , or equivalently @xmath268 .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath269 and from ( [ nxpc ] ) , @xmath270 .    in this case the width can be found by using @xmath271 as given by ( [ lnjsimsech ] ) and we can see that @xmath272 because @xmath273 . using @xmath257 again yields @xmath274 and because @xmath275 , ignoring factors of @xmath276 we have that @xmath277      expressing this equation instead using ( [ bessapprox ] ) , with inverse hyperbolic functions written out explicitly , and ignoring factors of @xmath276 yields @xmath279 which can be written more intelligibly as @xmath280 where @xmath133 can be calculated from @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
