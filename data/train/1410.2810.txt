    "multivariate numerical integration on hyper - rectangles of large dimension @xmath0 is often encountered in many areas of engineering and of physical , natural and social sciences .",
    "it is known that the accuracy of polynomial approximation techniques ( e.g.  cubature rules ",
    ", generally speaking ) exponentially degrades on increasing the number of variables , so that beyond @xmath1 these routes have to be abandoned . in these situations one",
    "is forced to resort , at last , to statistical integration techniques framed in the broad family of monte carlo ( mc ) routes . from the 40 s of past century , when statistical sampling was conceived at los alamos laboratory by scientists like von neumann , ulam and metropolis to face practical problems in particle physics @xcite , several improvements have been done to accelerate convergence , reduce uncertainty on the estimate , and limit the degradation of the efficiency at fixed computational cost as @xmath0 increases . in particular , we assisted at a flowering of variants of the basic  sample mean integration  ( e.g. quasi - monte carlo @xcite ) , and of the classical metropolis - hastings  importance sampling  mc @xcite ( is - mc in the following ) which is widespread in many branches of molecular and condensed matter physics where configurational partition functions need to be calculated . for example , functions of the genz s testing - family @xcite can by routinely integrated with high accuracy and low computational cost up to hundreds of variables by means of optimized quasi - random sampling strategies @xcite . despite of the large efforts that have been done to improve statistical integration , and of the constantly increasing computational power at disposal , there is still need for efficient algorithms which are robust regardless of the peculiar kind of integrand function .    in this work we present a tool to perform multivariate integration by exploiting a markovian stochastic exploration of the integration domain while the integrand function is morphed in a controlled (  deterministic  ) way .",
    "the strategy is rooted in an abstract interpretation of jarzynski s equality ( je in the following ) , which was derived about fifteen years ago in the context of the thermodynamics of systems ( mainly macromolecular ) subjected to thermal fluctuations and driven out of equilibrium by an external mean which has full control on a selected set of structural parameters @xcite . since a detailed description of the je on physical grounds",
    "would be not pertinent to the spirit of the present communication , we address the interested reader to the excellent reviews of refs .",
    "@xcite which comprise theory and experiments .",
    "we shall give here below only the essential lines to appreciate the integration methodology that we are going to present .",
    "in the essence , if @xmath2 denotes the helmholtz free - energy of a system at thermal equilibrium and _ constrained _ in a certain state specified by a set of controllable parameters , say @xmath3 , the free - energy change from state `` 1 '' to state `` 2 '' is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the so - called canonical configurational partition functions @xcite . explicitly , these are the integrals @xmath7 made over all _ unconstrained _ structural variables @xmath8 of the system , which fluctuate due to the contact with the thermal bath .",
    "@xmath9 is the configuration - dependent energy of the system ( here for two states `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) , @xmath12 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath13 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the je allows to evaluate @xmath14 by avoiding the explicit calculation of the partition functions , which becomes highly demanding ( or even unfeasible ) as the number of variables grows .",
    "namely , the je states that the free - energy difference can be cast into the exponential average of the amount of work @xmath15 performed by an external mean to drive the system from the equilibrium state `` 1 '' to the state `` 2 '' along non - equilibrium transformations where the controlled state - parameters are changed according to a prescribed ( but arbitrarily chosen ) protocol @xmath16 of finite duration .",
    "explicitly , the je is @xmath17 , where the average is taken over the ensemble of _ stochastic _ trajectories @xmath18 , each generated while the state - parameters are deterministically changed .",
    "we stress that , in thermodynamics , the work is identified with the amount of energy exchanged between the external mean and the system through a detailed action on some degrees of freedom of the system ( the set @xmath3 in this case ) ; thus , @xmath15 is obtained by accumulating the infinitesimal contributions @xmath19 to be evaluated ( i.e. , measured in experiments by knowing the applied forces , or calculated if trajectories are simulated ) at each instant along the specific trajectory .",
    "the je is valid under the mild conditions of _ i _ ) fluctuations of the uncontrolled variables is a markovian ( memory - less ) process @xcite , and _ ii _ ) the trajectory would sample the underlying canonical distribution proportional to @xmath20 after the protocol was stopped at some state @xmath21 .",
    "the je has been extensively applied to construct entire free - energy profiles between states connected by real , simulated , or even artificial steered trasformations .",
    "typical examples are real mechanical unfolding / refolding of biopolymers ( e.g. , rna hairpins ) by means of laser tweezers @xcite , simulated detachment of chemicals from binding sites of proteins @xcite , and virtual `` alchemical '' transformations of molecular moieties to evaluate solvation free - energies in a given environment @xcite .",
    "the strength of the je is that an accurate estimate of @xmath14 ( which means an accurate estimate of the ratio @xmath22 ) could be achieved from a limited number of runs starting from initial configurations @xmath23 drawn from the pool belonging to the same equilibrium state , and employing always the same protocol . in the experimental context , the je offers the remarkable link between a measurable quantity ( the work ) and the change of free - energy for a nanoscale system . on computational grounds ,",
    "the effort required by the je machinery to compute the ratio @xmath24 from a set of simulated transfomations is usually much lower than that required to compute the single partition functions by direct integration , and the accuracy of the outcome remains acceptable even when standard routes , like the metropolis is - mc , fail .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we `` borrow ''",
    "the je and adopt it out - of - context to efficiently solve multidimensional integrals , just exploiting ( by analogy with physical transformations ) the possibility to substitute the explicit integration with the evaluation of what we can term the `` computational work '' in doing the `` externally controlled '' build - up of the integrand function ( that we shall term `` morphing '' in the following ) starting from an easily integrable known profile . by viewing the canonical configurational partition functions of initial and final states ( physical context ) as nothing but multidimensional integrals of positive - valued functions ( computational context ) , and the steered non - equilibrium transformations on few system parameters while all the remaining , uncontrolled , degrees of freedom continue to fluctuate ( physical context ) as the analogous of the morphing of the integrand _ while _ the integration domain is stochastically explored by markovian moves compatible with the actual function landscape itself ( computational context ) , then an adaptation / exploitation of the je is straight devised as a tool to perform multidimensional integration . in a nave picture of adaptive nature of markov dynamics over an evolving landscape , sampling the integration domain _ while _ the features of the integrand function ",
    "grow  following an arbitrarily prescribed protocol is more efficient than exploring directly the given integrand landscape .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all applications of the je are strictly pertinent to the original physical contexts ( mainly chemical , namely the estimation of mean - field - potentials along specific coordinates of complex molecular or supra - molecular systems ) . with the present contribution",
    "we intend to enucleate from the je , taking out the physical traits , its essential computational feature of  machinery to perform multidimensional integration  in efficient way .",
    "although apparently trivial once formulated , we believe that our abstract rephrasing may disclose the real powerful of the je and bring it to a broader audience than the community of researchers active in physical - chemical areas . here",
    "we stress the crucial point that in statistics , namely in practices to sample from general distributions , the strategy named annealed importance sampling ( ais ) due to neal @xcite ( see also refs . @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) leads to an analogous of the je .",
    "being targeted to the sampling from a `` complicate '' ( eg .",
    ", multimodal ) distribution , the ais consists in morphing an initial easy - to - sample distribution up to the target one by filling the gap with a freely chosen number of bridging distributions .",
    "surprisingly , the ais seems to be almost unknown in the physical - chemical community , apart of few exceptions @xcite . by following neal s work",
    ", one can find a direct matching with jarzynski s relation when the developing of the intermediate distributions is translated in terms of transformation protocol ; on the other way around , the je framework gives to the ais a `` physical guise '' where the concept of `` work '' is the key - feature .",
    "once such a connection is made , our feeling ( and auspice ) is that the huge amount of expertises achieved in latter decade in the physical - chemical area can be trasferred to the development of pure numerical methods of stochastic integration .",
    "suggestions will be given in the course of our exposition , namely _",
    "i ) _ the possibility to generate paths @xmath25 via stochastic differential equations ( langevin - like equations ) in place of monte carlo chains , and hence to be inspired by the huge amount of studies of molecular brownian - like dynamics in condensed fluid phases ; _ ii ) _ devise optimal morphing protocols to improve accuracy and precision of the integral estimate , in analogy with what is done in molecular practices ( both simulations and experiments ) to reduce the energy dissipation during a steered transformation ; _ iii ) _ take benefit from the good practices , developed for the free - energy - difference evaluations , to control / estimate the errors on the outcome ; _ iv ) _ be aware of the vast physico - chemical literature of the last decade , where smart improvements of the basic implementation of the je are proposed ( the interested reader can find a valuable overview in ref .",
    "@xcite , and specific indications will be given in the section `` outlines and perspectives '' ) .    in developing our exposition we shall present a simple mean to perform the function morphing , namely the rising of the whole integrand function from an initial flat profile @xcite .",
    "in addition , with a simple trick we shall leave the context of positive - valued functions to account for general profiles of the integrands .",
    "besides of drawing the main methodological lines , we also developed the jemdi ( jarzynski equality multidimensional integration ) library , an optimized and easy to use c++ algorithm implementing our approach to stochastic integration , which is freely distributed as open - source software for tests and further developments @xcite .",
    "the article continues as follows .",
    "first we provide a general outline about how to frame jarzynski s equality in the abstract context of integration .",
    "then we opt for the morphing protocol from a flat profile , which is the most safer and case - independent choice if the details of the integrand are unknown . in section `` computational issues '' we briefly present the jemdi software which currently implements such a choice ; details of the numerical solver",
    "are provided in the supplementary material .",
    "then we test the algorithm on model cases , and give the proof of its outperforming efficiency when compared to the standard is - mc route ( i.e. , the direct evaluation of the integral without morphing ) .",
    "this is not surprising for experts in je ( or ais ) , since non - equilibrium routes are known to achieve a likely result in a reasonable computational time while such a standard counterpart completely fails .",
    "furthermore we provide an estimate of the uncertainty and a criterion to judge the reliability of the outcome . in our tests ,",
    "exploration of the integration domain will be made mostly by means of is - mc moves , but we give also an example where langevin dynamics are employed .",
    "the final section is devoted to remarks and perspectives .",
    "in this section we shall present the integration strategy rooted in the abstract formulation / usage of jarzynski s equality .",
    "we start by considering the physically framed case of positive - valued integrand functions",
    ". then we extend the method to general integrands that may have zeros and/or sign changes within the integration domain . throughout the text we make free use of physical terminology by leaving to the reader the effort to keep any step at the most abstract level .",
    "let us first consider the case of a real and positive - valued function @xmath26 , with @xmath3 a set of parameters defining its profile and @xmath27 the argument as a @xmath0-dimensional array of real variables .",
    "the function must be bounded and continuous in the interior of the integration domain @xmath28 with the further requirement that at boundaries the primitive function has a finite limit if @xmath26 diverges ( see discussion in section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "our purpose is to set up an efficient route to determine the integral @xmath29 if the integral is known for a certain set of parameters , say @xmath30 , one can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the  morphing factor  , related to the change of @xmath33 into @xmath26 , to be determined .",
    "let us imagine to randomly pick a point @xmath27 from the distribution @xmath34 , and drive the morphing in a deterministic way according to an arbitrarily chosen protocol @xmath35 where @xmath36 is treated as  time ",
    "variable varying from zero to one ( as a matter of fact , it is nothing but a dimensionless progression variable ) ; `` during '' such a transformation , be @xmath8 free to explore the integration domain by following a general type of stochastic markov  dynamics ",
    "@xcite , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the propagation step . by producing a large number of these transformations",
    "each conducted by employing the same protocol @xmath35 , starting from different initial states all sampled from the distribution @xmath39 , a non - equilibrium distribution @xmath40 will develop .",
    "the requirement of markov dynamics is important to assure that if the morphing was stopped at a certain @xmath41 and the dynamics continued , the distribution would relax to the underlying target distribution proportional to @xmath42 , that is @xmath43 .",
    "consider now the following path - integral along the @xmath44-th stochastic trajectory @xmath45 , @xmath46 where we have introduced @xmath47 we can state that the morphing factor in eq .",
    "can be expressed by the following limit taken over an infinitely large number @xmath48 of trajectories : @xmath49 the proof simply rests on the direct recognition that eq . corresponds to the je if the following identifications are done : _ i _ ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 are homologous to the configurational partition functions evaluated over the canonical distributions respectively originated by the pseudo - potentials @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; _ ii _ ) the morphing of the function corresponds to a steered transformation following the deterministic protocol @xmath35 ; _ iii _ ) the markovian exploration of the domain is equivalent to the markovian dynamics over the uncontrolled degrees of freedom in the physical context of non - equilibrium transformations ; _ iv _ ) the path - integral in eq .",
    "is interpreted as the  work  to morph the function while the integration domain is stochastically sampled ; _ v _ ) eq .",
    "is the analogous of the work - exponential - average in the proper je , being @xmath54 equivalent to the free - energy difference between the morphed and the initial states .",
    "such a one - to - one mapping of our computational problem into the physical context allows us to take _ directly _ eq . with eqs . - as an _ exact _ result right on the basis of the sound validity ( as theorem ) of the je itself .",
    "the interested reader may find a transparent derivation of the je , for example , in section ii of ref .",
    "looking at such a derivation , the tight connection with neal s ais method will appear ( see sec . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; namely , by taking a continuum of bridging distributions each labeled by @xmath55 , eq . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite gives exactly the factors @xmath56 , and eq .",
    "2 yields ( for the specific application ) the je estimator on a finite number of transformations .",
    "the above formulation is rather general .",
    "notice that , unlike the original physical context where the energetics of the system and the dynamical responses are often fixed by the nature of the sample , here there is plenty of room to choose the reference state @xmath30 for which @xmath57 is known , to optimize the protocol @xmath35 ( meaning that also single parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 could be varied independently and in different ways ) , and to choose / optimize the kind of markov exploration of the integration domain .",
    "the target is to achieve numerical convergence on @xmath61 with the lowest number of trajectories @xmath48 of shortest length ( i.e. , number of elemental propagation steps , see below ) .",
    "insights will be given in what follows .",
    "the choice of the evolution law @xmath37 is guided , in the computational context , only by the need of generating a markov chain which ensures that if the morphing is stopped then the dynamics would settle over the stationary  equilibrium  distribution as discussed above .",
    "_ any _ propagator able to create such a markov chain can be employed in the algorithm .",
    "regardless of the specific kind of evolution law , reflecting conditions have to be applied at the boundaries of @xmath28 .",
    "a straightforward method to create a markov chain is to explore the integration domain by means of is - mc moves of maximum length @xmath62 in each dimension @xmath44 @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the trajectory is broken into @xmath63 steps of equal `` duration '' @xmath64 .",
    "a generic step @xmath65 begins at @xmath66 and ends at @xmath67 , and consists of a first part where the function morphing proceedes for the duration @xmath68 at the location @xmath69 frozen , and a second part where a move is meant to happen instantaneously up to @xmath70 .",
    "in schematic form we have @xmath71 .",
    "an unbiased move is first attemped with the sole limitation that @xmath72 .",
    "the move is readily accepted if it is downhill , i.e. , if @xmath73 . on the contrary , a random number @xmath74 is uniformly generated between 0 and 1 and the move is accepted if @xmath75 , rejected otherwise . with such a classical scheme due to metropolis _",
    "@xcite , the requirement of relaxation to the underlying canonical distribution after stopping the morphing is automatically fulfilled by construction .",
    "work is performed only in the morphing part of a step , thus @xmath76 .",
    "the global amount per trajectory is then obtained by summing over the steps , which corresponds to take the discretized formulation of the integral in eq . along the path .",
    "the is - mc scheme is a fast and simple procedure that enables long - range rapid exploration and only requires the evaluation of the integrand function at each step .",
    "alternatively , evolution laws based on stochastic differential equations can be adopted , which require to supply also first - order derivatives ( which must be bounded and continuous in @xmath28 ) of the integrand function .",
    "the simplest and physically - framed propagation scheme of such a kind makes use of a langevin - like equation corresponding to a brownian - like exploration of the integration domain @xcite , i.e. @xmath77 _ { \\left \\lvert \\begin{array}{l } \\scriptsize{\\bm{x}=\\bm{x}({\\hat{t } } ) } \\cr \\scriptsize{{\\bm{\\lambda}}={\\bm{\\lambda}}({\\hat{t } } ) } \\end{array } \\right.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the vector whose @xmath0 entries are independent sources of white noise : @xmath79 and @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the @xmath82 identity matrix , @xmath83 the dirac s delta - function , and @xmath84 are ensemble averages over the distribution of noise magnitudes . in practice , at the actual @xmath36 , for each variable @xmath85 one generates @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a value randomly sampled from a distribution ( usually gaussian , but not necessarily so , see remarks in the supplementary material ) with zero mean and unit variance . finally , in eq .",
    "@xmath88 is a `` diffusion matrix '' which can be freely designed to be both point - dependent and deterministically modulated along the morphing , under condition that it must be real - valued , symmetric and positive - definite .",
    "this freedom can be exploited , in principle , to optimize in subtle way the stochastic exploration of the integration domain . as for the is - mc evolution",
    ", a single step of duration @xmath68 is meant to be constituted by a morphing part followed by a langevin propagation .",
    "the infinitesimal amount of work is evaluated exactly as for the is - mc case , and the work per trajetory follows by summing all contributions .",
    "the choice of the reference state @xmath33 is crucial to improve the efficiency of integration .",
    "a good balance should be found between closeness of @xmath33 to @xmath26 ( intuitively this would reduce the amount of  dissipation  in analogy with the physical steered transformations ) , simplicity of its integration ( possibly analytical ) to get @xmath57 , and capability to sample initial configurations quickly and without artefacts from the distribution @xmath89 ( such a difficulty is lowered if a factorization is recognized in the integrand function ) .",
    "clearly , only a well educated guess may lead to identify a suitable integrable function @xmath33 of which @xmath26 is intended to be a perturbed form . on the contrary , a dangerous bias might be introduced .    in the absence of some",
    "_ a priori _ knowledge , the simplest and safer choice is to start from a flat profile of the associated potential , that is @xmath90 for all @xmath8 , so that @xmath91 being @xmath92 the volume of the integration domain . in this case",
    "the initial sampling reduces to an unbiased random drawing of independent points in the @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "a proper value of @xmath93 can be set as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a guess ( even very rough ) of the integral ; with such a choice the morphing factor is expected to fall close to one .",
    "assessment of the outcome reliability on statistical grounds takes benefit of the sound experience gained in the context of the je applied to free - energy - difference calculations in physical ( mainly molecular ) systems .",
    "having generated @xmath48 trajectories , the best estimate of the integral is @xmath96 for @xmath97 such a relation is _ exact _ , while for any finite number of transformations the estimate bears an error , @xmath98 being @xmath99 the true value , which is due to the limited sampling of the low - work `` wing '' of the distribution of work values , @xmath100 . by looking at eq . , important trajectories which largely contribute are those with lower values of @xmath101 ; on the other hand , these trajectories are rarely encountered ( because of the low values @xmath102 in the distribution wing ) , hence their frequency of appearance , in a statistical sample of finite size , may largely deviate from the actual probability . in particular",
    ", the distribution of @xmath103 ( by supposing to repeat infinite times the calculation with a set of @xmath48 trajectories ) displays an average shift @xmath104 , that is a @xmath48-dependent systematic error , plus a broadening which arises from an intricate interplay between the ( unknown ) features of the work - distribution - function and the finiteness of the ensemble of work values at disposal .",
    "an indication about the systematic error can be inferred from the zuckerman - woolf theory developed for free - energy - difference calculations @xcite .",
    "it was already known that , _ on average _ , one gets an overestimation ( see eq .",
    "56 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the authors were able to derive a `` universal relation '' ( valid under mild conditions ) which links the systematic error to the variance of the outcomes . turning to our context , if we propagate back such an uncertainty to the integral ( we recall that the morphing factor is equivalent , in the essence , to the exponential of minus a free - energy - difference ) , the result for @xmath48 sufficiently high is that the integral is _ on average _ underestimated by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the standard deviation of the distribution of outocomes @xmath107 ( compare with eq .",
    "17 of ref .",
    "this relation tells us that if @xmath108 , then @xmath109 ( accurate outcome ) and @xmath110 ( precision estimator ) can be taken as a likely estimate of the interval of confidence . in the following",

    "it consists in randomly splitting the whole dataset with @xmath48 entries into @xmath115 groups ( in our tests , these groups are formed by @xmath116 consecutive trajectories as they are generated ) , and then taking @xmath117^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the morphing factors @xmath118 are computed with the @xmath119 trajectories of each @xmath120-th block .",

    "the idea is to choose @xmath115 yielding blocks which are supposed to be large enough to provide `` sensible '' estimates of the integral @xcite .",
    "we stress that the evaluation of @xmath106 from the data at disposal can be highly inaccurate due to the poor sampling of @xmath100 , so that the estimated ratio @xmath121 could result ( apparently ) small even if the systematic error is relevant .",
    "therefore one needs independent criteria to establish if @xmath100 is well sampled to allow one to take @xmath108 as reliable indicator of accurate integration .",
    "a criterion has been provided by jarzynski ( see note 23 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , hummer ( section iv of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and reaffirmed by others @xcite : good sampling of the low - work wing of @xmath100 is likely attained if @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the standard deviation of the work values ( still to be estimated , unfortunately , from the finite set of data at disposal ) .",
    "if such a condition is not fulfilled , one may slower the transformation protocol and/or increase @xmath48 . here",
    "we pursue a different empiric criterion which is applicable when the is - mc route is employed to make the markov exploration of the integration domain ( in section [ sec4 ] we shall validate its effectiveness ) .",
    "namely we evaluate the average percentage of accepted moves over the whole ensemble of paths and over the whole morphing schedule , @xmath124 .",
    "then by borrowing the recommendation for standard metropolis mc practices @xcite , we simply check if @xmath124 is around 50% .",
    "this follows by the guess that an efficient sampling of the integration domain ( although on average ) is associated to a slow - enough transformation ( a `` quasi - static '' one in the thermodynamics language ) , hence to low `` dissipation '' ( energy dissipation in the thermodynamics acceptation , see remarks in section [ sec5 ] ) , and hence to a precise / accurate outcome .",
    "here we shall tailor the above general scheme to the case of homogeneous morphing controlled by a unique parameter @xmath125 varying from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , the basic constant - rate ",

    "the strategy sketched above directly follows from the abstract interpretation of the je ; strictly speaking , integrands must be positive - valued in order to be assimilated to boltzmann factors .",
    "this severe  physical  limitation can be overtaken by means of a simple trick , namely splitting the general function @xmath135 ( which may have zeros and possibly change sign within the integration domain ) as @xmath136 where the components @xmath137 and @xmath138 are freely chosen positive - valued functions .",
    "the simplest choice is to apply @xmath139/2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is any function which satisfies @xmath141 .",
    "this ensures that , by construction , both components are positive - valued and the integration strategy above presented can be applied separately to them . the global uncertainty on the net integral",
    "is then evaluated by summing in quadrature the two uncertainties .    in the present implementation",
    "we adopt the following form @xmath142 with @xmath143 and @xmath144 a small number suitably chosen ( see below ) .",
    "one easily verifies that @xmath145 and @xmath146 if @xmath147 , while @xmath148 and @xmath149 if @xmath150 .",
    "thus , for @xmath151 sufficiently small , where @xmath152 the two components in eq .",
    "well approximate the original function ( in absolute value ) multiplied by positive factors @xmath153 or @xmath154 . in the opposite limit @xmath155 one",
    "has that @xmath156 .",
    "a special situation is for @xmath157 . in this case , for very small @xmath151 the component @xmath137 selects the positive part of @xmath135 while @xmath138 selects the negative part ( with inverted sign ) .",
    "the graphs of the two functions may display wide and almost flat regions with values of the order of @xmath158 .",
    "this may penalize the efficiency in evaluating the integrals , since the stochastic sampling of the integration domain would be very weakly driven out of these regions of negligible contribution ( specially when adopting the small - steps langevin propagator sensitive to local gradients ) .",
    "for this reason , the choice of some value @xmath159 is preferable since flat regions are avoided and both the details of @xmath135 where the function is positive - valued , and of @xmath160 where it is negative - valued , are distributed between @xmath137 and @xmath138 . concerning the actual values of @xmath161 and @xmath151 ,",
    "they could be tuned by considering their influence on the excursions of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that is , ultimately ,",
    "their control on the magnitude of the dimensionless  potential barriers  ( see eq . ) to be overtaken for an exhaustive exploration of the integration domain .",
    "regardless of such a detailed tuning , it suffices to take @xmath161 of the order of few units , and assign to @xmath151 a very small value by checking _ a posteriori _ that it was actually much smaller than the maximum value of @xmath160 encountered in the explorations of the integration domain .",
    "notice that the splitting in eq . can be applied _ a priori _ when the behavior of the integrand function within the integration domain is unknown .",
    "in fact , even for positive - valued functions one would generate @xmath162 , where @xmath137 is dominant for @xmath151 sufficiently small .    as a final remark we shall underline that cases may happen in which @xmath137 and @xmath138 are too close one to the other , so that the global outcome is much smaller ( in absolute value ) compared to them when taking the difference ; in these cases it is required to reach a very high accuracy on both @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with consequent lengthening of the calculation .",
    "the methodology outlined in the previous section has been implemented in the new jemdi library , which is distributed under the gpl v2.0 license @xcite .",
    "the core library files are written in the c++ language . the choice followed by the necessity of writing a code that can be easily modified , adapted , and included in other algorithms , all issues that can be straightforwardly handled using an object - oriented programming paradigm .",
    "proper wrappers have been implemented to link the library with c and fortran codes also . moreover , the algorithm is parallelized under the message passing interface ( mpi ) paradigm @xcite , giving the possibility to run on computer clusters .",
    "the actual parallelization scheme is quite simple : the total number of trajectories is divided among the processes allocated for the calculation .",
    "this scheme is nearly embarrassingly parallel , thus the computation time scales down linearly with the number of processes .",
    "the setup of a calculation may require the intervention of the user really on many parameters . to simplify the usage",

    "tests have been made with functions of @xmath172 variables @xcite .",
    "preliminary explorations on several smooth functions and differently extended integration intervals for the variables gave excellent outcomes , hence we shall present here directly the case of functions reputed to be hardly integrable by standard means ( see below ) .",

    "the numbers associated to each estimate give the average percentage of accepted moves , @xmath124 , here intended over the whole ensemble of paths and over the whole morphing schedule .",
    "a quick survey indicates that the outcome is satisfactory .",
    "notice that the best results ( accurate estimate and small error bar ) are obtained for @xmath181 values such that the _ average _ acceptance of moves is around 50% ( at least , not below 30% ) in accord with the criterion proposed in section [ sec2sub4 ] to guess if the integration domain is efficiently explored along the morphing .",
    "this poses a somehow empirical rule for an automatic selection of the optimal values @xmath62 ; such a criterion is implemented in jemdi ( see the supplementary material for details ) .    for comparison",
    "we have attempted integrations with the standard is - mc method applied directly to sampling from the distribution proprortional to @xmath135 . for each of 50 runs",
    "we have either generated , a ) a single markov chain with a number of steps equal to @xmath183 , or b ) @xmath119 chains with @xmath63 each ( in both cases the total number of steps is equal to that made in a non - equilibrium calculation employing the je ) .",
    "also , @xmath181 was optimized to get average acceptance percentage of moves close to 50% .",
    "a test was made with a total number of moves equal to @xmath184 , to be compared with @xmath185 and @xmath176 in figure 1 . in both cases",
    "a ) and b ) the outcomes were below the exact values by orders of magnitude , which means a failure of the standard is - mc integration .",
    "just to mention , for modality a ) the average outcomes with @xmath186 repetitions for @xmath172 were respectively @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , incomparable with the exact values ; even worse the outcomes for modality b ) . for completeness we also tried integration with the basic sample - mean mc , that is with unbiased drawing of @xmath184 points in the integration domain :",
    "outcomes were even worse .",
    "overall , such analysis indicates that our test - function can be classified as hardly integrable , and reveals a total failure of the standard mc route while the morphing schedule gives acceptable results under similar computational cost .",
    "the qualitative statement `` hardly integrable '' stems on the fact that this benchmark is much more stringent than frequently chosen testing - functions . for example",
    ", we have checked that standard is - mc ( without morphing ) could integrate with excellent accuracy all the testing - functions of ref .",
    "@xcite ( that is the @xmath191 and gaussian genz s functions , and the sobol-asotsky function , all built as product of 100 monodimensional factors ) , but we have seen that it fails here , while the morphing route gives acceptable results .",
    "let us turn back to the inaccuracy of the integration when @xmath181 exceeds a critical value .",
    "this makes @xmath165 dropping below @xmath180 and stabilizing on a plateau ; correspondingly , the average percentage of accepted moves drops to a constant value of the order of few units .",
    "the rationale of this behaviour lays in the fact that during the morphing a trajectory much probably falls into some  deep potential well  corresponding to a high function peak , and stays entrapped in it since subsequent is - mc moves are likely almost totally rejected if @xmath181 is so large that a jump would try to take the trajectory out of the well ( even accounting for possible reflections at boundaries ) towards locations of much  higher potential  .",
    "some insights on these features are given in the supplementary material .",
    "qualitatively this explains both the low global acceptance of moves ( mainly accumulated at the initial stage of the morphing when the potential wells are not yet pronounced ) and the underestimation of the integral since some of the peaks may be not visited during the morphing .",
    "the small error bars are clearly misleading in this case , but consistent with the fact that the integration appears to be precise although limited to the visited peaks .",
    "anyway , the low average percentage of accepted moves should warn the user about such a pathological situation .",
    "for @xmath181 optimized to yield the acceptance of moves closest to 50% , in table 1 we present the outcomes by varying independently the number of trajectories and their length .",
    "the percentage errors refer to the actual deviations from the exact value .",
    "indication of the execution time is also given .",
    "notice how , even in the case of 90 variables , such a function could be integrated with an error less than 5% in a reasonable time , while the standard is - mc counterpart ( without morphing ) completely fails .",
    "summarizing , the quality of a calculation with the is - mc propagator must be valued looking at _ both _",
    "indicators @xmath124 and @xmath192 : the former should be above , say , 30% ( we recall that the @xmath62 are automatically optimized in a jemdi run to bring @xmath124 as close as possible to 50% ) , and the latter must result @xmath193 for the systematic error being likely negligible and the outcome meaningful ( see discussion in section [ sec2sub4 ] ) . on the other hand , there may be situations where both indicators pass the checks but the result is inaccurate : in all cases it is good practice to assess convergence versus the increasing of @xmath48 and @xmath63 .",
    "the same typology of calculations on the same function has been performed by applying langevin exploration of the integration domain , with a scalar ( isotropic ) `` diffusion coefficient '' @xmath194 taken point - independent and constant during morphing .",
    "the results are presented in figure 2 , where @xmath194 is varied .",
    "notice how the estimated integral reaches a maximum versus increasing @xmath194 , and that the same trend ( increasing - decreasing ) is found for the error bars .",
    "these features are evident for the cases @xmath195 .",
    "plateaus far from the optimal @xmath194 value can be qualitatively explained as follows . at low @xmath194 , in the  timescale  of the morphing the exploration of the integration domain",
    "is limited in the neighborhood of the starting point ; this situation corresponds , by analogy , to the case of fast - switching protocols in the physical context of steered transformations where the system s lag requires a very extended set of runs to reach accurate outcomes @xcite . in the opposite limit of large @xmath194 ,",
    "the strong damping ( note that @xmath194 tunes the magnitude of the  deterministic force  in eq . ) drags a trajectory to a function maximum , which is very localized for the tightly peaked function here considered ( see contour sections in the supplementary material ) . in this case , for the 5000 trajectories there might be a relevant fraction of peaked regions not visited and hence missing as a matter of fact .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by choosing a random initial point @xmath196 and monitoring the euclidean displacement @xmath197 during the morphing .",
    "the profiles are presented in figure 3 for three values of @xmath194 . the optimal value ( the one yielding the best estimate of the integral ) is @xmath198 , which gives a smooth increasing of @xmath199 corresponding to departure from the initial point with a settling only in the final stage of the morphing . for smaller @xmath194 there is littler exploration of the domain , while for much larger @xmath194 the trajectory rapidly reaches a plateau which must correspond to a fall into a potential well ( a peak of the function ) . in this latter case ,",
    "a large @xmath194 value in the langevin equation enhances the magnitude of both the stochastic contribution to the pseudo - force ( notice the magnification of fluctuations amplitude ) and the deterministic component which drags the trajectory into a potential well . in this case , for different values of @xmath194 , different wells seem to be reached even starting from the same @xmath196    the global message is that the is - mc route is _ a priori _ preferable for several reasons : _",
    "i ) _ it does not require the demanding computation of  forces  , _ ii ) _ the empirical criterion based on the average acceptance of moves close to 50% allows one to parametrize the is - mc propagator , _ iii ) _ the is - mc gave better results in all our tests .",
    "in particular , the use of our jemdi routine with is - mc propagation is recommended unless a well educated guess from an _ a priori _ knowledge of the function details might address to a proper choice of @xmath194 ( or even to exploit the subtle point - dependent tuning , anisotropy , and modulation along morphing in the full diffusion matrix entering eq . ) .",
    "for the same function we have also performed successful tests of integration on hyper - rectangles of very different extension on the various dimensions .",
    "for example , for the variables @xmath200 ranging between @xmath201 and @xmath202 , @xmath203 between @xmath204 and @xmath205 , and @xmath206 from @xmath207 and @xmath208 , the outcome with @xmath209 variables was @xmath210 which well compares with @xmath211 obtained from the integration of the 3-variables building block with mathematica ( @xmath212 ) ; this calculation was done with @xmath175 trajectories partitioned into @xmath178 blocks to evaluate the uncertainty , @xmath176 using is - mc propagator with automatic optimization of @xmath62 .",
    "computational time was 6 minutes for a parallel run with the 12-processors machine @xcite .",
    "then we tried the integration of a function with many sign changes according to the splitting in equations - . like in the previous case study ,",
    "the function was built as product of 3-variables building blocks defined as @xmath213 where @xmath214 is still that given in eq . .",
    "a single calculation on the hyper - cube of @xmath215 variables ranging from @xmath216 to @xmath217 has been done by simulating a typical user s situation : automatic selection of @xmath62 , use of default value for the parameter @xmath151 ( see supplementary material ) , and choice of reasonable trial values @xmath175 , @xmath218 blocks to evaluate the uncertainty , @xmath176 , for a first run .",
    "the outcome was @xmath219 versus the exact value @xmath220 obtained by integration of the 3-variables block with dqand .",
    "the large uncertainty suggests to increase the number of trajectories and their length ; repetition with @xmath221 ( still with @xmath178 ) and @xmath222 gave the satisfactory result @xmath223 .",
    "computational time was 4.6 hours for a parallel run with the 12-processors machine @xcite .",
    "as final test in our hierarchy of case - studies we considered a function that presents sign changes inside the integration domain and singularities at the boundaries , but whose primitive has finite limit on those locations .",
    "preliminary checks revealed that the method is unable to integrate functions with singular points of divergence _ inside _ the integration domain ; on the contrary , divergences at boundaries are not problematic if the primitive function is bounded .",
    "again , we selected a function of three variables to produce the @xmath0-dimensional function by means of multiplication of the building block , which is @xmath224 calculations were done for @xmath0 = 15 and 30 variables with integration ranges @xmath225 $ ] , @xmath226 $ ] , and @xmath227 $ ] .",
    "the exact result in 3 variables obtained with dqand is 4595.90 .",
    "satisfactory convergence of the integration has been obtained with @xmath221 , partitioned into @xmath178 blocks to evaluate the uncertainty , @xmath222 , and by applying @xmath228 and @xmath229 for the parameters discussed in section [ sec2sub6 ] .",
    "the outcome in 15 variables was @xmath230 versus the exact value of @xmath231 , while in 30 variables we obtained @xmath232 versus the exact value of @xmath233 .",
    "computational times were respectively 2.6 and 4.7 hours for parallel runs with the 12-processors machine @xcite .",
    "these results still confirm that the method is able to integrate problematic and complex functions without particular problems .",
    "the main purpose of this work was to bring the computational essence of jarzynski s equality to the pure numerical context of multivariate integration devoid of any physical trait . before indicating some lines of investigation , we remark that here we have presented the very basic jarzynski s strategy , as it was presented in the early 1997 article @xcite .",
    "we have outlined the main ideas and presented the basic formulation presently implemented in our jemdi c++ routine , which revealed to be high - performing in a series of tests . in particular , our new approach where is - mc moves are combined with underlying function morphing , offers a chance to evaluate multidimensional integrals in an acceptable computational time . there may be critical situations ( depending on the number of variables , features of the integrand , extensions of the integration domain ) where the convergence rate is still too low , but the present strategy is expected to be much better performing than the standard counterpart .",
    "not last , the tool provides the statistical uncertainty on the outcome and the criterion to guess if the bias error is negligible ; this information is essential to judge ( and control ) the reliability of the result .",
    "there is still plenty of room for developments , mainly at the following three levels not yet explored : a ) selection of a good reference state from which the integrand morphing develops , b ) optimization of the markovian propagator , c ) tuning of the morphing protocol ( i.e. , use of non - linear and multi - parameter growth of the pseudo - potential ) and devising methods to minimize `` dissipation '' .",
    "the first point should be , in our feeling , the most effective item towards large improvements .",
    "notice that , from the ais perspective , adopting the flat reference state corresponds nothing but to adopt the simplest starting distribution which allows to get independent initial draws and which fully satifies ( regardless of the integrand function ) neal s indications : `` easier to sample from , and which is broad enough to encompass all potential modes '' ( quotation taken from sec . 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    concerning the point b ) , we recall that the exploitation of langevin dynamics deserves consideration since it can be a mean for efficient exploration of the integration domain if intuition can address to a proper tailoring of the point - dependent ( and possibly also progression - dependent ) diffusion matrix .",
    "this opens a wide landscape to explore ; an interested investigator can stand on the huge literature about single - molecule dynamics in the overdamped ( diffusive ) regime of motion with a configuration - dependent friction matrix able to affect the pattern of stochastic trajectories giving rise , for example , to saddle - point avoidance phenomena in the multidimensional pseudo - potential landscape ( the logarithm of the positive - valued integrand function ) @xcite . still concerning the setting of mc",
    "moves , a promising route coming from non - equilibrium simulations of molecular systems under steered transformations is that proposed by chelli @xcite who combined the `` configurational freezing '' scheme @xcite with the `` preferential sampling '' approach .",
    "the idea is that in steered physical systems , energy dissipation is mainly due to fluctuations close to the `` hot region '' where the external intervent takes place .",
    "this led to conceive a scheme where particles are moved within a mobility area ( roughly , a solvation shell ) which encloses the hot region , with a rule to select with preference the particles which are closer to the hot region ; particles moves are made in the way that the resulting chain is markovian and detailed balance is guaranteed , as required for the applicability of work fluctuations theorems like jarzynski s equality here treated .",
    "model cases treated in ref .",
    "@xcite were alchemical transformations of a water molecule into a methane molecule in the solvation environment , and formation of molecular dimers with solvation .",
    "however , how to transfer such a concept to multidimensional integration is a challenging target : by analogy , we guess that the `` mobility region '' , and the `` hot region '' within it , should be subsets of the whole variables @xmath8 to be determined through a sensitivity - like analysis applied to the pseudo - potential @xmath234 ( in fact , @xmath235 is the analogous , in stochastic thermodynamics , of the the infinitesimal amount of energy exchanged as heat ) .",
    "about the item c ) , a starting point could be the work of schmiedl and seifert @xcite on the construction of optimal protocols , based on the criterion to minimize the average work performed along the non - equilibrium trasformations . on physical grounds ( second principle of thermodynamics for isothermal systems at the nanoscale ) ,",
    "the average work is higher than the free - energy - difference by an amount that corresponds to the energy which is dissipated , on average , in driving the transformation .",
    "it can be demonstrated that such a dissipation is linked to the spread of work values and hence , ultimately , to the precision and bias of the outcome when jarzynski s estimator ( eq . ) is applied on a finite number of realizations .",
    "all considerations made for the physical problems can be transferred to the abstract context of multidimensional integration .",
    "a further suggestion to improve the basic route has been proposed by vaikuntanathan and jarzynski @xcite . in",
    "what they called `` escorted '' transformations , an artificial flow - field of the form @xmath234 ( our notation ) which `` suitably '' couples stochastic variables and controlled parameters , is added to bias the trajectories in the way to minimize ( even up to let vanish ) the dissipation .",
    "a reformulation of the je has been derived by the authors to account for the presence of such a flow - field ( see eqs 10 , 13 and 14 of the cited work ) .",
    "as the authors argue , trial and error experience could lead to contruct optimal schedules for classes of physical systems ; we say that the same would hold also for `` classes '' ( to be properly defined ) of integrand functions .",
    "at last we mention the interesting idea to sample the paths ( the trajectories ) according to their weight in the exponential average ( see section [ sec2sub4 ] ) ; in the method named single - ensemble nonequilibrium path - sampling ( seps ) @xcite , a properly biased sequence of paths is generated using the work as the variable in a metropolis mc scheme .",
    "all these ideas have been tested on low - dimensional cases , mostly uni- or bi - dimensional , but their application to high - dimensional cases would need to face the formidable problem of setting some key - ingredients case by case : optimal protocol , optimal flow - field , optimal bias function of the low - work wing of the work distribution function . on the contrary ,",
    "our basic implementation of jarzynski s equality has the merit to be directly applicable with the only need , as usual in computational practices , to check convergence on the outcomes .",
    "finally we like to mention our recent extension of the strategy here presented to the evaluation of nested sums over a large number of indexes with positive / negative addends ( a calculation impossible to tackle by exhaustive evaluation of each addend ) @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as the discrete counterpart of the multidimensional integration . in this case , the efficiency of the addends morphing ( still in combination with the je ) can be quantified , and appreciated , by looking at the incredibly small ratio between the number of required addends evalutations versus the total number of addends .",
