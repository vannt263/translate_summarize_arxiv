    "lately there has been interest in using two - particle irreducible ( 2pi)1/n methods to investigate various aspects of quantum field theory  @xcite . in a previous work  @xcite",
    "we showed how to renormalize the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations for the symmetric phase of the o(n ) model in the auxiliary field formalism , to order 1/n .",
    "this was done by first using the multiplicative renormalization approach  @xcite to find the exact renormalized sd equations , and then to realize that to leading order in 1/n one only needs to set the renormalized vertex function for @xmath2 to one ( @xmath3 ) , in order to consistently truncate the infinite hierarchy of renormalized green s functions . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the auxiliary field related to @xmath5 .    in order to carry out dynamical simulations with non - zero values of @xmath6 , which occurs , for example ,",
    "when chiral condensates are produced  @xcite , it is important to extend that result to the case of broken symmetry , @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we show that by extending the multiplicative renormalization scheme used for the symmetric phase , we can obtain finite renormalized s - d equations for the broken symmetry phase . since the 2pi1/n approach is a resummation of the ordinary 1/n expansion , it is important to ask to what extent the ward - takahashi identities preserved in the original perturbative 1/n approach  @xcite are preserved in the 2pi1/n approach .",
    "one of these identities leads to the goldstone theorem  @xcite .",
    "goldstone s theorem states that if continuous symmetry is broken , and there is a residual symmetry , there should be massless particles in the theory corresponding to the number of symmetries left unbroken .",
    "as has been previously pointed out for the 2pi1/n , the goldstone theorem is formally satisfied if one determines the masses from the inverse propagators derived from the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) generating functional for the @xmath8 fields  @xcite .",
    "however one expects ( and we find ) that the inverse propagators obtained directly from the 2pi1/n generating functional for the would be massless particles do _ not _ vanish as @xmath9 as @xmath10 in violation of goldstone s theorem .",
    "what we explicitly find is that the condition for the spontaneous symmetry breakdown found from the renormalized equation for the expectation value of @xmath11 leads to a mass for the would be goldstone bosons at order 1/n .",
    "the evolution equations obtained from the 2pi1/n effective action are energy preserving .",
    "if we modify by hand these equations to enforce the goldstone theorem , we would then violate energy conservation at order 1/n .",
    "this violation of the goldstone theorem can be more satisfactorily remedied by constructing an improved effective action functional as discussed in van hees and knoll  @xcite .",
    "however , this then leads to a much more complicated set of equations which includes ( in addition to solving for the one and two point function equations ) solving simultaneously the bethe - salpeter equations for the vertex function . given present computational power",
    ", this would be not feasible for @xmath12 dimensional calculations at this time .",
    "the improved effective action is not entirely satisfactory in that the propagators on internal lines still do not obey the goldstone theorem .",
    "one can hope , however , from a phenomenological point of view , that the violation of the goldstone theorem by this approximation is not very serious .",
    "in making a realistic phenomenological model of pions using the o(4 ) model one has to _ explicitly _ break the o(4 ) symmetry if we want the pion to have the correct physical mass .",
    "this is done by introducing an external source coupling to the field with non - vanishing expectation value ( i.e. the @xmath13 particle ) .",
    "one then determines the magnitude of this external source by using the partially conserved axial current equation ( pcac ) .",
    "this was discussed in a previous paper on disoriented chiral condensates  @xcite . as long as the mass generated by the breakdown of the goldstone theorem is small compared to the mass generated by the _ explicit _ violation of the symmetry",
    "then this breakdown should not be important for phenomenological applications .",
    "our renormalization procedure will lean heavily on our previous result for obtaining renormalized s - d equations in the symmetric vacuum  @xcite .    before continuing with our approach",
    "we will discuss some previous approaches to goldstone theory problems .",
    "firstly , in a direct 1/n expansion to order 1/n@xmath14 , binoth _",
    "@xcite have performed all renormalizations .",
    "they found no inconsistencies with the goldstone theorem , and the residual o(n-1 ) symmetry is preserved .",
    "this is a very comforting result , but as we have discussed previously  @xcite , a direct 1/n expansion leads to secularity problems in the dynamics which is our main interest here . in an important paper , arrizabalaga _",
    "@xcite realized that one can avoid the problems with the goldstone theorem discussed here , by breaking the symmetry and then taking the limit of zero symmetry - breaking .",
    "this is valid if we one is interested in o(n)-invariant initial conditions , but also having goldstone particles .",
    "we will discuss this approach later . finally , ivanov _ et al _",

    "<S> we derive the renormalized schwinger - dyson equations for the one- and two - point functions in the auxiliary field formulation of coleman , jackiw , and politzer  @xcite for @xmath0 field theory , to order 1/n , in the 2pi1/n expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the renormalization of the broken - symmetry theory depends only on the counter terms of the symmetric theory with @xmath1 , as discussed in our previous paper  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 2pi1/n expansion violates the goldstone theorem at order 1/n . </S>",
    "<S> in using the o(4 ) model as a low energy effective field theory of pions to study the time evolution of disoriented chiral condensates one has to _ explicitly _ break the o(4 ) symmetry to give the physical pions a nonzero mass . in this effective theory </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the additional small contribution to the pion mass due to the violation of the goldstone theorem in the 2pi-1/n equations to be unimportant for an adequate description of the phenomenology . </S>"
