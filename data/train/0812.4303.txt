    "forty - five years ago , hoyle & ellis ( @xcite ) proposed the existence of an extensive layer of warm ( 10@xmath0  k ) , low density ( 10@xmath1  @xmath2 ) ionized hydrogen surrounding the plane of our galaxy and having a power requirement comparable to the ionizing luminosity of the galaxy s o and b stars .",
    "their conclusion was based upon their discovery of a free - free absorption signature in the observations of the galactic synchrotron background at frequencies below 10 mhz . however , the idea that a significant fraction of the lyman continuum photons from the galaxy s o  stars could travel hundreds of parsecs throughout the disk conflicted with the traditional picture in which the interstellar neutral hydrogen confined the ionizing radiation to small volumes ( i.e. , `` classical h  ii  regions '' ) near the hot stars . nevertheless , a few years later , the dispersion of radio signals from newly discovered pulsars ( hewish _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) plus the detection of faint optical emission lines from the diffuse interstellar medium ( reynolds @xcite ) firmly established warm ionized hydrogen as a major , wide - spread component of our galaxy s interstellar medium .",
    "but it was an additional two decades before deep h@xmath3  imaging with ccds began to reveal similar warm plasmas permeating the disks and halos of other galaxies ( rand _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; dettmar @xcite ) , establishing the wim as not just a peculiarity of the milky way , but a common property of galaxy disks .",
    "though originally detected by radio techniques , subsequent developments in high - throughput fabry - perot spectroscopy and ccd imaging have demonstrated that the primary source of information about the distribution , kinematics , and other physical properties of the wim is through the detection and study of its faint emission lines at optical wavelengths .",
    "not surprisingly , the most detailed studies have been made for the milky way , particularly for the region within about 3 kpc of the sun .",
    "for example , the wisconsin h@xmath3  mapper ( wham ) has been used to map the distribution and kinematics of the h@xmath4 over the sky through the hydrogen recombination line and to probe the temperature and ionization conditions through the detection of weaker forbidden lines of trace ions and atoms ( e.g. , haffner _ et al . _ @xcite ; madsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    the wham survey has revealed a complex morphology for the h@xmath4 , with filaments and blobs extending to high galactic latitudes and superposed on a smoother h@xmath3  background that covers the sky .",
    "comparisons of emission measures ( @xmath5 ) , derived from the h@xmath3  intensity , with pulsar dispersion measures ( @xmath6 ) indicate that the h@xmath4 is clumped into regions having an average electron density @xmath7 @xmath2 and filling a fraction @xmath8 of the volume within a @xmath9 pc thick layer about the galactic midplane .",
    "half of the h@xmath4 is located at heights @xmath10 pc . within these ionized regions ,",
    "the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized ( h@xmath4/h @xmath11 ) and has a temperature that is generally warmer than that of classical o  star h  ii  regions ( see sec .",
    ". the wim accounts for 90% or more of the ionized hydrogen within the interstellar medium , and along lines of sight at high galactic latitude , the column density of the h  ii  is observed to range from 20% to 60% that of the h  i. for details on how these parameters were derived , see the review by haffner _",
    "( @xcite ) and references therein .",
    "the low h@xmath3  surface brightness of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) in the halo of the galaxy , approximately 1/10 that associated with the wim ( e.g. , tufte _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , implies that the source of the ionization of the wim must be within the disk . in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "the h - ionization rate needed to sustain the wim is about 1/7 that available from stellar lyman continuum photons . in other galaxies ,",
    "the fractions are found to scatter around a value closer to 1/2 .",
    "only o  stars have this much ionizing power ( e.g. , reynolds @xcite ) .",
    "studies of face - on galaxies in particular reveal that the total h@xmath3   luminosity of the diffuse ionized gas is on average approximately equal to that of the discrete , classical h  ii  regions ( ferguson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; zurita _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; oey _ et al . _",
    "moreover , across the faces of the galaxies , the h@xmath3   luminosity per unit area of the diffuse ionized gas tracks that of the discrete h  ii  regions ; that is , it correlates with the lyman continuum production rate per unit area of a galaxy s o  stars ( zurita _ et al . _",
    "therefore , o  stars are almost certainly the primary source of the wim s ionization .",
    "the wim is wide - spread throughout the disk and halo , and its emission line spectrum differs significantly from that of the higher density , classical h  ii  regions immediately surrounding o  stars .",
    "how can these observed properties be reconciled with o  star ionization ?      to produce the extensive ionization that is observed ,",
    "the stellar lyman continuum photons must be able to travel hundreds of parsecs through the galactic disk .",
    "this places severe constraints on the distribution and column density of the h  i  within the galaxy .",
    "for example , at a distance of 200  pc from an o  star ( typical lc luminosity @xmath12 photons s@xmath1 ) , the ionizing flux is about @xmath13 photons s@xmath1 @xmath14 .",
    "a balance of hydrogen ionizations and recombinations will show that an ionizing flux at this level will be totally absorbed by a cloud of density 1  @xmath2 or more having a column density of just @xmath15  @xmath14 .",
    "models suggest that a fractal h  i  distribution produced by interstellar turbulence ( e.g. , elmegreen @xcite ; wood _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) or large cavities ( superbubbles / chimneys ) created by clustered supernovae explosions ( e.g. , norman & ikeuchi @xcite ) may provide the necessary pathways .",
    "for example , 3d radiation transfer models by wood _",
    "( @xcite ) are illustrated in figure 1 for `` strmgren spheres '' in density stratified gaseous disks .",
    "for the smooth density distribution , the h  ii  region surrounding a single o  star or a small cluster of o  stars is confined to the midplane ; however , when a portion ( 2/3 in this particular model ) of the gas is hierarchically clumped , ionizing radiation from a single o  star reaches more than 1  kpc from the disk .",
    "not only models , but direct observations show that superbubbles also can be efficient conduits for ionizing photons .",
    "one such structure , shown in figure 2 , is the perseus superbubble , which extends above and below cas ob6 ( ocl 352 ) , a cluster of nine o  stars associated with the w4 h  ii  region in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "h@xmath3  emission from the outer boundary of this bubble indicates that 40% or more of the lyman continuum luminosity of the o  star cluster escapes the w4 h  ii  region and ionizes gas out to 30@xmath16 ( 1200  pc ) or more from the stars ( reynolds _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . however , it is not clear which ( if either ) of these avenues for the transport of ionizing radiation is correct .",
    "the morphology of the interstellar medium has not yet been characterized , and even though some superbubbles are observed to provide extended pathways , it is not known whether such cavities are sufficiently prevalent to account for the extensive h@xmath4 .    ) are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 corresponding to a cluster of 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 o  stars , respectively .",

    "the position of the w4 h  ii  region associated with cas ob6 , the presumed source of the ionizing photons , is also indicated.,width=302 ]    finally , o  stars alone do not appear to be sufficient to produce the diffuse ionization .",
    "a study of edge - on galaxies by rossa & dettmar ( @xcite ) has shown that the existence of an extended layer of h@xmath4 in a galaxy appears to require a star formation rate that exceeds a specific threshold ( corresponding to an fir surface brightness of @xmath24 ergs s@xmath1 per kpc@xmath25 of galactic disk ) . above this threshold , does the morphology of the interstellar medium change , allowing @xmath26 of the ionizing radiation to escape the star formation regions ?      a second challenge for o  star ionization is the fact that the emission line spectrum of the wim differs significantly from that of the classical h  ii  regions that immediately surround o  stars .",
    "one of the most interesting differences involves the [ n  ii]@xmath276583/h@xmath3  and [ s  ii]@xmath276716/h@xmath3  line intensity ratios .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 , which compares [ s  ii]/h@xmath3  and [ n  ii]/h@xmath3  in numerous high galactic latitude wim sightlines with the ratios toward classical h  ii  regions . for the h  ii  regions ( fig .",
    "3a ) , [ n  ii]/h@xmath3  is tightly clustered near 0.25 , with [ s  ii]/h@xmath3  @xmath28 .",
    "the two exceptions are faint h  ii  regions associated with hot , low mass evolved stars ( see madsen _ et al . _ @xcite ) . on the other hand , for line ratios in directions that sample the wim ( fig .",
    "3b ) , most of the [ n  ii]/h@xmath3  ratios and nearly all of the [ s  ii]/h@xmath3  ratios are significantly larger than those toward the classical h  ii  regions .",
    "this result appears to be a characteristic of diffuse ionized gas , not just in our galaxy , but in general ( see , e.g. , rand @xcite ; t \" ullmann & dettmar @xcite ; hoopes & walterbos @xcite ) .",
    "discussions of other spectral differences can be found in t \" ullmann & dettmar @xcite , madsen _",
    "@xcite , and haffner _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that these enhanced forbidden line intensities ( relative to h@xmath3 ) are due primarily to higher temperatures in the wim compared to the classical h  ii  regions .",
    "the [ n  ii]@xmath276583/h@xmath3   intensity ratio is given by    @xmath29}{\\rm{h}\\alpha } = 1.62\\times10 ^ 5~t_4^{0.4}~e^{-2.18/t_4 } \\left(\\frac{\\rm{n}^+}{\\rm{n}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{h}}\\right )    \\left(\\frac{\\rm{h}^+}{\\rm{h}}\\right)^{-1 } ,   \\label{ch1eq : niieq}\\ ] ]    /h@xmath3  versus [ s  ii]/h@xmath3  toward classical ob star h  ii  regions ( left ) and in directions that sample the wim ( right ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines represent lines of constant temperature ( from eq .",
    "4.1 ) with 5000  k @xmath30  10  000  k. the four sloped solid lines represent , with increasing slope , values of constant s@xmath4/s @xmath31 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , and 1.0 ( eq . 4.2 ) . for a more detailed description ,",
    "see madsen _",
    "_ @xcite.,width=245 ]    where @xmath32 is the electron temperature @xmath33 in units of @xmath34  k , n / h is the gas phase abundance of nitrogen relative to hydrogen , and n@xmath4/n and h@xmath4/h are the ionization fractions of n and h , respectively . because h@xmath4/h is nearly equal to n@xmath4/n ( both are near unity ) in the ionized regions , local variations in [ n  ii]/h@xmath3  must be due essentially to variations in temperature ( see discussion in madsen _ et al . _",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed by observations of other emission line ratios , in particular , [ o  ii]/h@xmath3  ( otte _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; mierkiewicz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and [ n  ii]@xmath275755/[n  ii]@xmath276583 ( madsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    because the excitation energies for the [ s  ii]@xmath35 and [ n  ii]@xmath36 emission lines are nearly identical , the expression for [ s  ii]/h@xmath3  has nearly the same dependence on @xmath33 as the expression for [ n  ii]/h@xmath3 , so that    @xmath37}{[\\rm{n~\\textsc{ii } } ] } = 4.62~e^{0.04/t_4}~              \\left(\\frac{\\rm{s}^+}{\\rm{s}}\\right )",

    "observed variations in [ s  ii]/[n  ii ]  are primarily a measure of variations of s@xmath4/s .    from the above discussion",
    ", the data in figure 3 can be interpreted as measurements of @xmath33 and s@xmath4/s within the ionized regions .",
    "the data show that not only is the wim generally warmer than the h  ii  regions , but that within the wim there are substantial variations in both the temperature and ionization state from one line of sight to the next .",
    "the variations in s@xmath4/s could be a measure of differences in the ionization parameter , that is , the s@xmath4-ionizing photon density to electron density ratio , within the ionized regions ( mathis @xcite ) .",
    "the significant variations in temperature are more difficult to understand .",
    "photoionization models suggest that some temperature increases could result from the hardening of the ionizing spectrum as the radiation passes through density bounded h  ii  regions before reaching the more distant wim ( wood & mathis @xcite ; wood _ et al . _",
    "however , this mechanism does not explain the highest values of [ n  ii]/h@xmath3 , i.e. , the large range in temperatures that is observed",
    ". to produce the higher temperatures , an additional , non - ionizing source of heat must be added ( wood & mathis @xcite ) .",
    "one clue about the nature of this supplemental heating is the observed strong anticorrelation between [ n  ii]/h@xmath3  ( temperature ) and the h@xmath3   intensity ( gas density ) .",
    "this anticorrelation is apparent in observations of our galaxy ( e.g. , madsen _",
    "@xcite ) and other galaxies , not just with increasing distance @xmath38 from the midplane , but also in observations at constant @xmath38 ( e.g. , rand @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior could be explained if there were a heat source with a heating rate per unit volume proportional to the first power of the density , or did not depend upon density at all .",
    "then , at sufficiently low densities , such a source would dominate over photoionization heating ( which is proportional to @xmath39 ) , producing the observed inverse relationship between temperature and density ( see reynolds _ et al . _",
    "the required heating rate is @xmath40 erg s@xmath1 per h@xmath4 , or @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( wood & mathis @xcite ; reynolds _ et al . _",
    "possible sources include photoelectric heating by dust ( weingartner & draine @xcite ) , dissipation of turbulence ( minter & spangler @xcite ) , and magnetic reconnection ( raymond @xcite ) .",
    "the thick layers of warm , low density h@xmath4 in spiral galaxies contain clues about the structure of the interstellar medium and the transport of energy away from regions of star formation at the midplane .",
    "some progress has been made in understanding this gas , but many fundamental questions remain : how does the ionizing radiation propagate through the disk ? why is the h@xmath4 layer so thick ?",
    "what is the distribution of the wim within the interstellar medium ? what is its relationship to the other phases of the medium ?",
    "what is the source of the elevated temperatures in the wim ?",
    "comparisons of the observed distribution , motions , and line ratios of the wim with predictions of models have begun to address some of these questions ( e.g. , hill _",
    "_ @xcite ; wood & mathis @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps a next step is to compare the observations to more sophisticated multi - phase , dynamical models that included sources of heating and ionization with 3d radiation transfer .",
    "the observations would constrain model parameters , and the models could predict properties of the gas to guide future observations . +"
