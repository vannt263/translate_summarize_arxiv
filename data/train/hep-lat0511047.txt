    "the overlap operator  @xcite is the closest known lattice dirac operator to the continuum operator . with the lattice community currently moving beyond the quenched approximation , one obvious possibility is to use dynamical overlap fermions .",
    "the advantages of the overlap operator are well known : it satisfies the ginspag - wilson lattice chiral symmetry exactly ; there is an easy non - perturbative renormalisation ; there is no operator mixing involving different chiral sectors ; there is a well defined index ( @xmath0 ) , equal to the topological charge in the continuum limit ; the anomaly is correctly accounted for ; and it is essential for stuties of topics such as topology , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , and the eigenvalue spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "since chiral symmetry is so important to low energy qcd , it seems a waste not to use the only dirac operator which we know of which fully respects this symmetry .",
    "of course , there are reasons not to use the overlap operator .",
    "firstly , it is considerably slower than ( for example ) staggered or clover fermions .",
    "secondly , the discontinuity in the overlap operator creates a number of unique problems when trying to impliment a hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the first of these issues will not be a problem once we have sufficiently fast computers , which will be in the very near future ( we have already run some trajectories on a @xmath1 lattice ) .",
    "now is the perfect time to tackle the second problem , and to create a hybrid monte carlo algorithm for overlap fermions .    in this talk",
    ", i shall summerize the work done so far on this issue .",
    "work has been published in this area by z. fodor _ et al _",
    "@xcite , by myself in collaboration with thomas lippert and stefan krieg  @xcite , and by t. degrand and s. schaefer  @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : two ] provides a brief introduction to hybrid monte carlo and the overlap operator .",
    "section [ sec : three ] discusses the problem of topological charge changes .",
    "section [ sec : four ] mentions some additional problems and advantages concerned with dynamical overlap fermions .",
    "section [ sec : five ] gives a few numerical results , and our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : six ] .",
    "the overlap dirac operator is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a mass parameter , @xmath4 is the hermitian wilson dirac operator , and @xmath5 is the matrix sign function . in our numerical simulations",
    "@xcite , we use a zolotarev rational approximation to the sign function  @xcite with the small eigenvalues treated exactly using eigenvalue projection , but for the purposes of this talk , i shall assume that we can calculate all the eigenvalues @xmath6 and eigenvectors @xmath7 of @xmath4 and thus treat the matrix sign function exactly using @xmath8 . this will simplify the algebra while retaining the important features of the algorithm .",
    "we will define @xmath9 as the hermitian overlap operator @xmath10 .",
    "the hybrid monte - carlo ( hmc ) algorithm  @xcite updates the gauge field in two steps : ( 1 ) a molecular dynamics ( md ) evolution of the gauge field ; ( 2 ) a metropolis step which renders the algorithm exact . in the md step ,",
    "we introduce a momentum , @xmath11 , which is conjugate to the gauge fields @xmath12 , and a spinor field @xmath13 which is used to estimate the fermion determinant via a heat - bath .",
    "we define an hybrid monte - carlo energy @xmath14 + \\phi^{\\dagger}(h)^{-2}\\phi.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath15 is the gauge action , and we will use either the luscher - weisz or wilson plaquette action . we introduce a computer time @xmath16 and integrate over the classical equations of motion to generate the correct ensemble .",
    "we can not perform an exact integration , so we need to use a numerical method such as the omelyan integration step  @xcite .",
    "this will create a small error in the energy conservation , which we can correct for by including an additional metropolis step , accepting or rejecting the new configuration according to a probability @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the initial energy and @xmath20 the energy at the end of the md .",
    "it is therefore important that we conserve energy as well as possible during the md to ensure a high acceptance rate .",
    "note that we do not have to use the classical trajectory : any reversible update which leads to a small @xmath21 will suffice .",
    "our md procedure does not even have to conserve area , as long as we can easily calculate the jacobian @xmath22 .",
    "if we have a non - area conserving update , we just have to include the jacobian in the metropolis step , using a new @xmath23  @xcite . to have a high acceptance rate ,",
    "we need @xmath24 .",
    "the crucial part of the md procedure is the force used to update the momentum , defined as @xmath25 + \\phi^{\\dagger}(d^{\\dagger } d)^{-1}\\phi)}{\\partial u}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the fermionic part of this force for the overlap operator is @xmath26 we can differentiate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath4 using a procedure analogous to first order time independent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath27 note that only mixings between eigenvalues of different signs contribute to the fermionic force , and only mixings between the small eigenvalues are important .",
    "the main feature of the fermionic force is the dirac @xmath28-function coming from the differential of the sign function .",
    "we shall discuss how to deal with this in the next section .",
    "the @xmath28-function in the fermionic force , which occurs whenever one of the wilson eigenvalues crosses zero ( i.e. whenever there is a change in the index of the overlap operator ) , should , in an exact integration , introduce a discontinuity in the momentum , which will exactly cancel the discontinuity in the pseudo - fermion energy caused by the abrupt change in the matrix sign function .",
    "we can visualise this in a classical mechanics picture by picturing a potential wall of height @xmath29 surrounding each topological sector .",
    "we can easily calculate the height of the wall ( which can be either positive or negative ) , either by integrating the fermionic force across the @xmath28-function , or by calculating the difference in the pseudo - fermion energy .",
    "both these procedures give @xmath30 @xmath31 is the hermitian overlap operator just after the crossing , @xmath32 the operator just before the crossing . in a classical mechanics picture ,",
    "the momentum would be updated in a direction parallel to @xmath33 , the normal to the topological sector wall , thus : @xmath34 .",
    "if the momentum is too small ( i.e. this procedure can lead to an imaginary momentum ) we reflect of the potential wall .",
    "however , as remarked earlier , there is no reason why we have to stick to the classical mechanics picture .",
    "below , we shall describe how a general updating procedure can be derived to account for the potential wall .    to calculate the jacobian",
    ", we need to work with the coordinate and momentum vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath36 can be calculated easily from the momentum field @xmath37 , where @xmath3 and @xmath38 refer to the direction and lattice site , and @xmath39 are the generators of the gauge group .",
    "the gauge coordinate @xmath35 is defined so that an update of the gauge field @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "we correct for the @xmath28-function in three steps .",
    "( 1 ) we update the gauge field to the potential wall @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) we update the momentum , using @xmath43 , where we shall determine the functional form of @xmath44 later ; ( 3 ) we return the gauge field to the original point @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the computer time at which the eigenvalue is zero , i.e. @xmath47 @xmath48 refers to the scalar product of the two vectors . differentiating @xmath46 with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 gives @xmath49 any function , @xmath50 , of @xmath51 ( such as @xmath52 or @xmath33 ) will obey the relation @xmath53 we are now in a position to write down the jacobian .",
    "using the gauge update above gives @xmath54 we can calculate @xmath22 using two quick determinant manipulations .",
    "we subtract @xmath46 times the top row from the bottom row .",
    "we then subtract @xmath46 times the right column from the left column .",
    "these manipulations kill the bottom left hand element .",
    "two lines of algebra later , and we obtain @xmath55 we consider the components of the momentum normal to @xmath33 and perpendicular to @xmath33 separately . for example , if we update the momentum normal to @xmath33 , then we use the momentum update above and insert this jacobian into the condition @xmath56 needed for a high acceptance rate .",
    "this immediately gives us a differential equation for @xmath57 : @xmath58 it is trivial to solve this equation to obtain the momentum update @xmath59 we have written the constant of integration as @xmath60 to ensure reversibility .",
    "@xmath61 should lie in the range @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 gives us the classical mechanics solution .",
    "we can not allow the final momentum to be complex .",
    "therefore , if the initial momentum is in the range @xmath64 , where @xmath65 we can use equation ( [ eq : transmission ] ) to update the momentum ( we call this case _ transmission _ ) . following  @xcite , we reflect the momentum of the potential wall if the momentum lies outside this range ( i.e. we use @xmath66 , with some additional terms  outlined in  @xcite  to ensure o(@xmath67 ) energy conservation ) .",
    "we need to keep the transmission rate as high as possible in order to reduce the topological autocorrelation",
    ". we can calculate the transmission rate by assuming that the momentum is initially distributed according to @xmath68 .",
    "the probability of transmission is @xmath69 and we can show that @xmath70 for @xmath71 . therefore @xmath72 maximises @xmath73 .",
    "we can also update the momentum in directions perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "the procedure is exactly the same as above , and there are a large number of possible solutions , depending on the number of dimensions and how we combine the gauge fields .",
    "the simplest is , perhaps , the two dimensional case .",
    "we write @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ". we can now proceed to change @xmath76 , using @xmath77 .",
    "] , using @xmath78 we can also update as many of these pairs of momentum fields as we like , or work in more than two dimensions .",
    "however , no matter what update we use perpendicular to @xmath33 , the probability of transmission remains ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , we can use the updates perpendicular to @xmath33 to remove one rather large annoyance : an o(@xmath46 ) energy violating term . without some means of removing this , we would have to reduce the time step to unfeasibly small values : it would cripple the algorithm .",
    "it is easy to show that the procedure outlined above only conserves energy up to order @xmath46 , because we update the gauge field , but not the momentum field , to the topological sector wall .",
    "we can update the momentum field using the force perpendicular to @xmath33 without affecting the jacobian ( as long as we only change components of the momentum field orthogonal to this force ) , but we can not so easily use the component of the force normal to @xmath33 .",
    "this leaves us with an energy violation @xmath80 .",
    "we can , however , add this term to the perpendicular update , for example by changing @xmath81 in equation ( [ eq : perpupdate ] ) .",
    "this allows us to remove the o(@xmath16 ) and many of the o(@xmath67 ) energy violating terms , leaving us with a correction step that is almost o(@xmath82 ) .",
    "we had @xmath83 the good news is that this is ( approximately ) independent of the volume . however , it is proportional to the inverse square of the mass @xmath3 ( see table [ tab : masses ] for a rough numerical confirmation of this ) .",
    "the probability of transmission has an exponential dependence on @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , at small masses we are going to have a low acceptance rate .",
    "this can partially be solved by introducing multiple pseudo - fermion fields  @xcite , but it still remains a serious issue that still needs to be resolved .",
    "we also expect problems changing topological sector at small lattice spacing .",
    "zoltan fodor and his collaborators have recently developed a novel algorithm to avoid the necessity of changing topological sectors  @xcite .",
    "it is easy , by continually reflecting , to keep the simulation fixed within one topological sector . by starting in several different topological sectors ,",
    "it is possible to calculate the expectation value of an observable with each topological sector . to calculate the total expectation value",
    ", one has to find the relative weighting of the various sectors .",
    "this can be done by measuring an observable ( which is defined only on the topological sector wall ) on either side of the wall .",
    "although there are still some doubts concerning the ergodicity of this method , it does represent an interesting possibility to solve the problem of the topological autocorrelation at small masses .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "dynamical overlap fermions offer an exiting prospect for lattice qcd at small masses .",
    "however , the hmc is considerably harder to implement because of the discontinuity in the .dirac operator the largest problem , how to deal with the dirac - delta function in the fermionic force , has been solved .",
    "we still have a number of smaller issues to resolve , such as the problem of the topological autocorrelation at small masses and due to mixings between small eigenvectors of opposite signs .",
    "however , progress is being made on these issues .",
    "although overlap fermions are still rather slow , we hope to begin large - scale simulations in the near future .",
    "we are currently working on lattices with sizes up to @xmath1 and at masses of approximately one third of the strange quark mass , and larger lattices and smaller quark masses should be possible on the next generation of computers .",
