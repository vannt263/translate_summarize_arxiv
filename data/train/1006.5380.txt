    "@xcite first demonstrated tailoring of the pump spectrum using direct modulation of the injecting current of the pump laser . since then",
    ", a number of research groups have successfully broadened the bandwidth of the sbs slow light up to tens of ghz , which is much larger than the intrinsic linewidth of the sbs resonance @xcite . however , as we broaden the pump beam spectrum , its power spectral density decreases , thereby suppressing the sbs gain . as a result ,",
    "the slow light delay , which is proportional to the sbs gain , also decreases .",
    "therefore , the power of the pump beam must be increased to compensate for the reduction of gain at larger bandwidths @xcite . as the power increases",
    ", other nonlinear optical processes can become important if their response time is fast in comparison to the inverse of the pump beam spectral width .",
    "for example , stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) and the modulation instability ( mi ) have response times of @xmath01  ps@xcite and @xmath010  fs@xcite respectively , and hence are not affected by pump broadening of several ghz .",
    "eventually , as the bandwidth of the pump is increased and the power increased in proportion , srs and/or the mi becomes more efficient , potentially robbing pump power and limiting the sbs gain .",
    "olsson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite predict that srs dominates over sbs for pump bandwidths larger than 20 ghz for a gain of 20 db .",
    "no experiment validation of this prediction has been made to the best of our knowledge .",
    "on the contrary , our experiment shows that the mi is the dominant competing process in a 9.2-ghz - bandwidth sbs slow light device , which limits the sbs gain - bandwidth product .    in this paper",
    ", we study the competing effects and the related limitations on broadband sbs slow light .",
    "first , we introduce our broadband sbs slow light experiment and describe the competing processes that can possibly suppress the sbs process .",
    "we then verify that sbs is suppressed due to the mi in our broadband sbs device , where a standard single - mode leaf fibre is used as the sbs medium .",
    "we focus here on the leaf fibre because it is a readily available , relatively inexpensive fibre used in long - haul communication systems and hence is likely to be selected for sbs slow light devices .",
    "we also use a wavelength of 1.55 @xmath1 m because it is in the centre of the telecommunication band . as a solution to the problem",
    ", we show that the mi and the associated sbs slow light degradation are eliminated by using a dispersion shifted fibre that has normal dispersion at the 1.55 @xmath1 m wavelength window .",
    "finally , we compare the sbs gain - bandwidth - product limit imposed by the mi with the limit imposed by srs following the approach of olsson _",

    "in a broadband sbs slow light device , an optical pulse ( the signal ) is delayed by interacting with a counterpropagating broadband pump beam via the sbs process .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , two beams ( signal and pump ) counterpropagate through the slow - light medium ( fibre ) , where they interact and create low - frequency acoustic waves via electrostriction .",
    "these acoustic phonons , in turn , scatter the optical beams via brillouin scattering . when the frequency of the signal beam is tuned to the stokes line , that is , downshifted by the brillouin frequency @xmath5 from the frequency of the pump beam ,",
    "the opto - acoustic coupling becomes strong , and light from the pump beam is efficiently scattered into the signal beam , inducing a gain resonance and giving rise to a variation in the refractive index in a narrow frequency range around the resonance frequency , which results in a small @xmath3 for the signal beam @xcite .",

    "the signal beam ( dfb1 ) is modulated with a mach - zehnder modulator ( mzm ) and is injected from the other end of the fibre via a circulator .",
    "fibre polarization controllers ( fpc ) are used to match the polarization orientations of the pump and signal beams .",

    "there are a number of effects that limit the sbs gain @xmath46 , thereby limiting the sbs slow light delay .",
    "one ultimate limitation on the sbs slow light delay is sbs gain saturation caused by pump depletion .",
    "it takes place when the stokes beam becomes so strong that most of the power contained in the pump beam is transferred to it .",
    "two different saturation processes are involved .",
    "one occurs when the initial probe beam is strong ; the amplified probe beam grows quickly and depletes the pump beam even for moderate @xmath46 .",
    "the other one takes place when @xmath46 approaches a threshold value @xmath47 , found to be @xmath010 in single - mode fibres @xcite , where spontaneous brillouin scattering from thermal fluctuations is amplified and becomes sufficiently large , depleting the pump power even in the absence of a probe beam . when the pump beam is depleted , the undepleted pump assumption is no longer valid . as a result , @xmath46 , and thus the delay time @xmath45 ,",
    "no longer grow with increasing pump power @xcite .",
    "stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) is another competing nonlinear effect in which a pump beam is scattered by high - frequency optical phonons @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the frequency at which the srs gain resonance occurs is downshifted by @xmath013 thz from the frequency of the pump beam in single - mode fibres . in the presence of a strong pump beam , the stokes beam initiated by spontaneous raman scattering",
    "is amplified exponentially via the srs process .",
    "when the srs gain reaches a threshold value of @xmath010 in single - mode fibres @xcite , most of the pump power is transferred to the stokes beam .",
    "the srs gain with a monochromatic pump is typically two orders - of - magnitude smaller than the sbs gain .",
    "however , as a result of the fast response time of srs in single - mode fibres ( @xmath481 ps ) @xcite , the raman gain is not affected by the spectral broadening of the pump beam up to the value of 9.2 ghz used in our experiment , whereas the sbs gain is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the pump as shown in . as the pump bandwidth increases , the sbs gain will eventually match the srs gain , setting the scale for competition between these processes .",
    "mi is yet another process that can compete with the broadband sbs process .",
    "mi results from the interplay between the nonlinear kerr effect and material dispersion .",
    "it is a four - wave - mixing process where two copropagating photons of the same frequency are converted into a frequency up - shifted and down - shifted photon pair @xcite . as a result",
    ", the mi broadens the spectrum of continuous wave ( cw ) or quasi - cw beams , even turning a continuous wave beam into a train of pulses @xcite . in the presence of a strong cw or quasi - cw beam propagating through the fibre , noise components in the vicinity of peaks of the mi gain experience exponential amplification , which leads to the creation of two symmetric spectral side lobes @xcite .",
    "the gain profile of the mi is given by @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( in cycles / s ) is the frequency shift at which the maximum gain is obtained , and @xmath51 is the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) parameter . here",

    "similar to srs , the mi is not affected by the pump broadening of 9.2 ghz due to its fast response time ( @xmath4810 fs ) . we will show that mi is the dominant competing effect in our sbs experiment at high input pump power @xmath28 in a leaf fibre .",
    "in the experiment , as shown in figure 1 , a distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser operating at @xmath01.55 @xmath1 m is used as the pump source .",
    "we modulate the injecting current of the dfb laser with a modified triangle function so that the output beam of the dfb laser has a square - shaped spectrum with a bandwidth of 9.2 ghz @xcite . the output of the dfb laser",
    "is then amplified with an erbium - doped fibre amplifier ( edfa ) to provide enough pump power for the broadband sbs process .",
    "the edfa also controls the input pump power and thereby controls the sbs gain .",
    "another dfb laser is used to generate the signal beam , which is tuned to the sbs resonance . to avoid probe - induced sbs gain saturation ,",
    "the signal beam is attenuated to a power of 2 @xmath1w before it is injected into the sbs medium , where it counterpropagates and interacts with the pump beam via the sbs process .",
    "the amplified and delayed signal is detected at the output .",
    "the gain @xmath46 is obtained by measuring the output powers of the signal beam with the pump beam on and off .",
    "we use two different fibres as the sbs medium in the experiment , a 20-km - long leaf fibre from corning and a 2-km - long hnlf fibre from ofs .",
    "the parameters of the fibres are shown in table 1 .",
