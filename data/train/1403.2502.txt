    "early investigations performed with the walecka model for nuclear matter @xcite show that the inclusion of a vector - isoscalar channel is an essential ingredient for an accurate description of nuclear matter .",
    "later , such a channel has been considered to extend the standard nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) , which originally included only a scalar and a pseudoscalar type of channels , in order to obtain a saturating chiral theory for nuclear matter described only by fermions @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the introduction of the vector interaction , and thus of the vector excitations , is also important in determining the properties of strongly interacting matter at intermediate densities where vector mesons mediate the interactions and their exchange might be responsible for kaon condensation at high density .",
    "recently , the presence of a vector interaction in the njl model was crucial to reproduce the measured relative elliptic flow differences between nucleons and anti - nucleons as well as between kaons and antikaons at energies carried out in the beam - energy scan program of the relativistic heavy ion collider @xcite .    regarding the qcd phase diagram at finite quark density",
    "it has been established that the net effect of a repulsive vector contribution is to weaken the first order transition @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been observed that the first order transition region shrinks , forcing the critical end point ( cep ) to appear at smaller temperatures , while the first order transition occurs at higher chemical potential values when the vector interaction increases .    since the finite density region of the qcd phase diagram is not yet accessible to lattice simulations one usually employs model approximations to study the associated phase transitions as well as to evaluate the equation of state ( eos ) to be used in stellar modeling .",
    "one of the most popular models adopted in these investigations is the njl which , as already referred , can be easily extend to accommodate a vector channel while keeping the original symmetries . at present , despite its importance , the vector term coupling @xmath0 can not be determined from experiments and lattice qcd simulations , although there have been some attempts to determine its value .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a vector coupling constant of the order of magnitude of the scalar  pseudoscalar coupling was obtained by fitting the nucleon axial charge or masses of vector mesons and in @xcite , the pion mass and the pion decay constant were recalculated as a function of the vector interaction and shown to vary by about 10% when for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the scalar coupling .",
    "eventually , the combination of neutron star observations and the energy scan of the phase - transition signals at fair / nica may provide us some hints on the precise numerical value .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath0 has been taken as a free parameter in most works .",
    "finally , note that this channel interaction can be generated by higher order ( exchange type of contributions ) which are present in approximations which go beyond the large-@xmath4 limit like the the nonperturbative optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) @xcite .",
    "the fact that a strong enough vector term may turn the first order phase transition , which is expected at the low temperature part of the qcd phase diagram , into a smooth cross over ( for the realistic case of quarks with finite current masses ) may also have astrophysical implications affecting the structure of the compact stellar objects . in ref .",
    "@xcite a variable vector coupling was used in the discussion of the possible properties of quark stars and the authors have shown that depending on the value of the vector coupling the star could either be self - bound and present a finite density at the surface or bear a very small density at the surface , behaving as a standard ( hadronic ) neutron star .",
    "the maximum stellar mass obtained , @xmath5 , corresponds to the largest vector coupling considered , @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 . after these seminal works",
    ", a repulsive vector term was also used in many other investigations involving hybrid stars and possible phase transitions to a quark phase @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of the vector interaction in describing massive stars has also been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "another timely important problem concerns the investigation of the effects produced by a magnetic field @xmath8 on the qcd phase diagram and also on the eos used to model neutron stars .",
    "the motivation stems from the fact that strong magnetic fields may be produced in non central heavy ion collisions @xcite , as well as being present in magnetars @xcite .",
    "regarding stellar matter the low temperature part of the qcd phase diagram , where a first order ( chiral ) phase transition is expected to occur @xcite , constitutes the relevant region to be investigated .",
    "the question of how this region is affected by magnetic fields has been addressed in refs . @xcite and @xcite in the framework of the three flavor njl and pnjl models respectively .",
    "one of the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in this regime the symmetry broken phase tends to shrink with increasing values of @xmath8 . at these low temperatures , the chemical potential value associated with the first order transition decreases with increasing magnetic fields , effect known as the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon ( imc )",
    "this result has been previously observed with the two flavor njl , in the chiral limit @xcite , as well as with a holographic one - flavor model @xcite and more recently with the planar gross - neveu model @xcite . a model - independent physical explanation for imc is given in ref .",
    "@xcite while a recent review with new analytical results for the njl can be found in ref .",
    "another interesting result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite concerns the size of the first order segment of the transition line which expands with increasing @xmath8 in such a way that the critical point becomes located at higher temperature and smaller chemical potential values . note that , depending on the adopted parametrization , this region can display a rather complex pattern with multiple weak first order transitions taking place @xcite .    concerning the low temperature portion of the phase diagram one notices that so far most applications have considered effective models with scalar and pseudoscalar channels only .",
    "however , as already pointed out , the presence of a vector interaction can be an important ingredient to reproduce some experimental results or compact star observations , and so , should also be taken into account in the computation of the eos for magnetized quark matter .",
    "a step towards this type of investigation has been recently taken in ref .",
    "@xcite where two flavor magnetized quark matter in the presence of a repulsive vector coupling , described by the njl model , has been considered .",
    "the results show that the vector interaction counterbalances the effects produced by a strong magnetic field .",
    "for instance , in the absence of the vector interaction , high magnetic fields ( @xmath9 ) increase the first order transition region . on the other hand a decrease of this region",
    "is observed for a strong vector interaction and vanishing magnetic fields .",
    "also , at low temperatures and @xmath10 , the coexistence chemical potential decreases with an increase of the magnetic field ( imc ) @xcite , however , the inclusion of a the vector interaction results in the opposite effect .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field together with a repulsive vector interaction gives rise to a peculiar transition pattern since @xmath8 favors the appearance of multiple solutions to the gap equation whereas the vector interaction turns some metastable solutions into stable ones allowing for a cascade of transitions to occur @xcite .",
    "the most important effects take place at intermediate and low temperatures affecting the location of the critical end point as well as the region of first order chiral transitions .",
    "more realistic physical applications require that one considers more sophisticated versions of the simple two flavor model considered in ref .",
    "strangeness is a necessary ingredient when describing the structure of compact stellar objects or the qcd phase diagram .",
    "therefore , the purpose of the present work is to study magnetized strange quark matter in the presence of a repulsive vector interaction .",
    "we are also interested in understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter described by two different vector interactions @xcite and @xcite and two commonly used parametrizations of the njl model @xcite . in the following we refer to the extended version of the njl model that incorporates a vector interaction as njlv model .",
    "we first evaluate the similarities and differences at zero temperature of pure quark matter obtained with the two models by investigating the behavior of the constituent quark masses and the related eos for two different physical situations , namely matter with the same quark chemical potentials and the same quark densities .",
    "once the underlying physics is understood , we move to stellar matter conditions . having in mind two",
    "recently @xmath11 pulsars measured psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite , @xmath12 , and psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite , @xmath13 , we discuss which form of the vector interaction results in higher compact star masses .",
    "we devote special attention to the zero temperature part of the phase diagram which is currently not accessible to lattice simulations and which constitutes the important region as far as the physics of compact stars is concerned .",
    "we do not consider the color superconducting phase in the interior of hybrid stars , which would make the equation of state softer .",
    "our conclusions on the maximum star masses should , therefore , be regarded as upper limits .",
    "in order to consider quark matter under the influence of strong magnetic fields and in the presence of a repulsive vector interaction we introduce the following lagrangian density , where the quark sector is described by the su(3 ) version of the njl model : @xmath14 \\psi ~+~ { \\cal l}_{sym}~ \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by : @xmath18   ~ ,   \\label{lsym}\\ ] ] @xmath19 +   { \\rm det } \\left [ { \\bar \\psi}(1-\\gamma_5 ) \\psi \\right ] \\right \\ } ~ ,   \\label{ldet}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 represents a quark field with three flavors , @xmath21 is the corresponding ( current ) mass matrix while @xmath22 represents the quark electric charge , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unit matrix in the three flavor space , and @xmath25 denote the gell - mann matrices .",
    "we consider @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath17 term is the thooft interaction which represents a determinant in flavor space which , for three flavor , gives a six - point interaction @xcite and @xmath16 , which is symmetric under global @xmath27 transformations and corresponds to a 4-point interaction in flavor space .",
    "the parameters of the model , @xmath28 , the coupling constants @xmath3 and @xmath29 and the current quark masses @xmath30 and @xmath31 are determined by fitting @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 to their empirical values .",
    "two parametrization sets are used in the present work and the constant values are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".[tab1 ] parameter sets for the njl su(3 ) model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in face of the results we have obtained for quark stars , we next choose to construct hybrid stars with the p2 model and both hk and rkh parameter sets because this vector interaction term yields the hardest quark matter eos . for the hadronic phase , we use the gm1 parametrization @xcite and hyperon meson coupling constants equal to fractions of those of the nucleons , so that @xmath36 , where the values of @xmath37 are chosen as @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this is the same choice as in @xcite for the case of hybrid stars with the quark phase described by the njl model ( without the vector interaction ) .",
    "the eos obtained with a maxwell construction for magnetic fields equal to @xmath40 g and @xmath41 g are shown in fig.[figs5]a ) for two values of @xmath42 , being @xmath43 the maximum possible value for which a hybrid star can be built with parameter set hk . for values larger than 0.22 , the quark matter eos becomes too hard and in a pressure versus baryonic chemical potential , the hadronic and quark eos no longer cross each other . for an eos built with gm1 and rkh , the curves are very similar , but the maximum possible value of @xmath42 for the crossing of the hadronic and the quark eos is 0.19 .    taking into account",
    "that njl does not describe the confinement feature of qcd , we can not , in fact , fix the low - density normalization of the pressure . in order to account for this uncertainty",
    "the authors of @xcite have included an extra bag pressure that allows the density at which the transition to deconfinement occurs vary . including this term in such a way that the deconfinement transition occurs at lower densities than the ones obtained in the present study would have allowed us to choose a larger @xmath0 and therefore , a larger maximum mass would be possible . in the present study",
    "we renormalize the pressure in such a way that it is zero for zero baryonic density and do not discuss the effect of including an extra bag pressure .    in fig .",
    "[ figs5]b ) the mass radius curves obtained for the hk parametrization from the solution of the tov equations are displayed .",
    "these macroscopic results are also shown in table [ tableh ] . in this table",
    "we present results for both the hk and rkh parametrizations , three values of the vector couplings , @xmath44 and the maximum possible value of @xmath42 for each parameter set , and two values of the magnetic field intensity @xmath40 and @xmath45 g. some of the entrances for the central baryonic density are not indicated because they lie on an intermediate value between the density of the hadronic phase at the quark phase onset and the corresponding density of the quark phase .",
    "the only maximum mass configuration that really has a quark core is obtained for @xmath40 g and @xmath10 within the hk parametrization , giving rise to a 1.91 @xmath46 star .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the largest maximum masses are now obtained , in general , with the parameter set rkh and not hk , the case of quark stars .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quark phase sets in at smaller densities for the hk parametrization making the eos softer .",
    "this result had already been obtained in @xcite .",
    "one can see that the maximum stellar masses depend very little on the vector interaction strength . for the larger magnetic field",
    "considered , the onset of quark matter occurs at a larger density than the central density of the maximum mass hadronic star configuration , for both parametrizations .",
    "the same occurs for @xmath40 g and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for the hk ( rkh ) parameter set .",
    "in these cases the properties of the quark phase do not affect the star properties . on the order hand , from fig . [",
    "figs5]b ) for @xmath40 g and @xmath49 , it seems that as soon as the quark phase sets in the star becomes unstable .",
    "nevertheless , if we compare the baryonic density at the centre of the star with the baryonic density at the onset of quarks , we conclude that this maximum mass star could , in principle , contain a quark core .",
    "had we performed a gibbs construction , the star core would be in a mixed phase .",
    "all other stars are ordinary hadronic stars .    as an overall conclusion",
    ", it may be stated that a star that is subject to a strong magnetic field attains a smaller baryonic density in its centre , and , therefore , the quark phase is not favored .",
    "this same conclusion was obtained in @xcite where the quark phase was described within the mit bag model .",
    "moreover , since the inclusion of a vector interaction makes the quark eos harder , it is also natural to expect that a quark eos with a large @xmath0 difficults the occurrence of a quark core .",
    "the weak point of the standard njl model is the fact that it does not include confinement , and , therefore , the normalization considered for the pressure is not well defined .",
    "stars with very high masses are predicted and maximum masses of observed compact stars may set an upper limit for the largest possible magnetic field at the centre of the star , @xmath50 g for 2@xmath46 stars .    of course , had we chosen the p1 model to build the hybrid star , the @xmath42 value that would allow for a maxwell construction would certainly be larger than 0.19 or 0.22 , depending on the choice of parameters , but the stellar maximum mass would probably be smaller than 2 @xmath46 .",
    "it is worth remembering that all results presented here depend also on the choice of the coupling constants and meson - hyperon parameters for the hadron phase .",
    "in the present work we have studied quark matter in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "we had as our main objective understanding the interplay between the effects of an external magnetic field effect and the presence of vector interaction in the quark density lagrangian .",
    "quark matter was described within the su(3 ) njl model , and we have considered two forms of the vector interaction , a flavor dependent and a flavor independent ones , both frequently used in the literature .",
    "two scenarios of homogeneous quark matter were considered : equal flavor chemical potential and equal flavor density . in the first scenario",
    "the role of the vector interaction is an important ingredient , affecting the fraction of each kind of quarks .",
    "for the flavor dependent vector interaction the @xmath51 quark fraction increases with the vector interaction . within the flavor independent vector interaction the strangeness sets in at a quite high baryonic density independently of the vector coupling .",
    "as the presence of @xmath51 quarks softens the eos , the hardest eos were obtained with the flavor independent vector interaction .",
    "the larger the vector coupling the harder the eos . at low densities",
    "the magnetic field has an effect contrary to the vector interaction and softens the eos due to appearance of landau levels with a large degeneracy .",
    "in fact , if the vector interaction is strong enough the low density first order transition disappears and a crossover occurs .",
    "the magnetic field , however , increases the range of densities for which matter is unstable . on the other hand , at large densities , both the vector interaction and the magnetic field act in the same direction , in particular ,",
    "they make the eos harder .",
    "stellar matter and compact star properties in the presence of a static magnetic field that increases with the baryonic density , have also been studied . for quark stars",
    "we have shown that the larger the vector coupling the larger the maximum star mass , independently of the form of the vector interaction .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the flavor independent vector interaction predicts larger mass stars , which can be 0.1- 0.3 @xmath46 larger depending on the magnitude of the vector interaction .",
    "the presence of a static magnetic field increases the maximum mass , and masses above @xmath52 are obtained for a magnetic field that is @xmath53 g in the centre of the star .",
    "we have shown that within the present quark model hybrid stars with a quark content in its centre are only possible if neither the vector coupling nor the magnetic fields are too strong .",
    "strong magnetic fields disfavor the formation of a quark phase .",
    "this fact , however , may have interesting consequences as already discussed in @xcite , giving rise to a phase transition when the magnetic field decays .",
    "this kind of phase transitions are expected to release a large amount of energy , possibly in the form of a @xmath54-ray burst .",
