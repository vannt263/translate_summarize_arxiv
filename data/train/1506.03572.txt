    "in recent years there is a substantial amount of literature dealing with the dislocation pileups in crystals within the continuum approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the proposed models turn out to be quite useful as they can predict the size effect for the yield stress , which agrees quite well with the experimental data @xcite but however does not confirm the well - known empirical law formulated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a traditional explanation of the hall - petch relation , based on the classical dislocation pileup model considered in @xcite , is that dislocation pile - ups serve to enhance the stress felt at grain boundaries .",
    "however , the leibried s dislocation pileup model differs from the contemporary continuum models @xcite in two important aspects : firstly the absence of a threshold stress for dislocation nucleation , and secondly the absence of a finite - sized dislocation - free region .",
    "this is the motivation for us to reconsider the leibfried s model in order to resolve this discrepancies .",
    "leibfried s one - dimensional theory of dislocation pileups is based on the force equilibrium : the peach - koehler resultant force acting on a dislocation produced by applied external stress and by other dislocations must vanish @xcite . within the continuum approximation",
    "one can deduce from here the well - known integral equation @xcite , provided the dislocation density is not zero .",
    "this equation need not be satisfied in a dislocation - free zone .",
    "in his now classical paper @xcite mentioned that the natural way to find the stable equilibrium distribution of dislocations if such a zone occurs is to use the variational principle of minimum energy : among all admissible distributions of dislocations the true stable distribution minimizes energy of the crystal ( cf . with the leds - hypothesis formulated in @xcite ) . to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge , the one - dimensional continuum model of dislocation pileups based on the energy minimization taking the self - energy of dislocations into account has not yet been proposed .",
    "the aim of this short paper is to fill this gap .",
    "we start from the expression for the energy of crystal containing an array of dislocations which includes also the self - energy of dislocations .",
    "the self - energy density is proportional to the absolute value of the dislocation density , so this does not change the resultant force acting on the dislocation as well as the integral equation except the forces acting at the tails of the pileups . however , this self - energy influences the stable equilibrium distribution of dislocations essentially .",
    "we will show that the density of dislocations is identically zero if the applied stress is found below some critical value called the yield ( or threshold ) stress . besides , the number of dislocations depends on the applied stress non - linearly , in contrast to the classical theory .",
    "the results of the proposed theory agree quite well with those of the continuum models of dislocation pileups obtained in @xcite . a continuum model of dislocation pile - ups taking into account the frank - read source proposed in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) leads to the similar results although it does not have the energetic structure .    in the next section we present the continuum model of dislocation pileup accounting for the self - energy of dislocations . in section 3",
    "the energy minimization problem is solved and the related property of the solution is discussed .",
    "finally , section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "consider the plane strain problem of an infinite crystal which is uniformly loaded by a shear stress @xmath0 applied at infinity . under this loading condition a linear array of equal number of positive and negative edge dislocations may occur on the slip line which is chosen to be the @xmath1-axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] ) . the dislocation lines are parallel to the @xmath2-axis , while their burgers vectors are directed along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "we assume that there are two obstacles ( like two inclusions or grain boundaries ) at @xmath3 so that dislocations are confined to stay in the interval @xmath4 of the @xmath1-axis . in the continuum limit",
    "we may replace the sum of many closure failures induced by dislocations in form of step functions by a smooth function @xmath5 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pileup3 ] ) .",
    "the obstacles impose the following constraints on this function @xmath6 now we present the resultant inverse plastic distortion @xcite in the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the dirac - delta function . differentiating this equation with respect",
    "to @xmath1 we obtain @xmath9 the interpretation of is quite simple : if we integrate this equation over a circle @xmath10 with the middle point at @xmath11 and the radius @xmath12 , then @xmath13 thus , we get the closure failure of an amount @xmath5 which should be equal to the net burgers vector of all dislocations within the interval @xmath14 . denoting the dislocation density by @xmath15 , we get @xmath16 so , it is extremely useful to think of this double pileup of dislocations as a mode ii crack and to interpret the closure failure @xmath5 as the crack opening which is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pileup3 ] .    the energy of this system can be found directly from the energy of crystal containing continuously distributed dislocations in the interval @xmath17 of the @xmath1-axis .",
    "indeed , for the plane strain state the energy functional per unit depth of the crystal reads @xmath18=\\int_{a}\\phi ( \\varepsilon     _ { \\alpha \\beta } -\\varepsilon ^p_{\\alpha \\beta } ) \\ ,",
    "dxdy-\\int_{\\partial a}\\tau _",

    "then we can present the shear stress @xmath28 on the @xmath1-axis in the form @xmath29 the first term in this formula gives the stress field induced by the continuous distribution of dislocations excluding those in the neighborhood of @xmath1 ( the integral @xmath30 in is defined as cauchy s principal value ) , the second term corresponds to the stress field caused by the external shear stress @xmath0 . substituting into the energy functional and integrating the first term by parts ,",
    "we obtain finally @xmath31=-\\frac{d}{2}\\int_l\\int_l \\ln |x-\\xi |\\varphi ^\\prime ( x)\\varphi ^\\prime ( \\xi ) \\,d\\xi \\ , dx -\\int_l \\tau \\varphi ( x)\\ , dx.\\ ] ] the double integral in is the symmetric form of the quadratic functional which should be understood in the following sense @xmath32 it is interesting to note that this quadratic functional is positive definite and obeys an inequality similar to that of wirtinger ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note also that , since the left - hand side is invariant with respect to the scaling @xmath33 due to the boundary condition , the arguments in the log - kernel can be regarded as dimensionless .",
    "functional is the energy functional of the classical continuum dislocation theory in which , as we have seen from the previous derivation , the self - stress of dislocations is excluded .",
    "this means that the self - energy of dislocations is neglected .",
    "let us now take the self - energy of dislocations into account by the following deliberations .",
    "it is well - known that the self - energy of one dislocation ( per unit length ) does not depend on its sign and equals @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the distance of dislocation to the boundary of crystal and @xmath37 the poisson ratio @xcite . since the dislocation density is @xmath38 and since the self - energy does not depend on the sign of dislocations , the total self - energy of dislocations is given by @xmath39 adding this energy to the functional we get finally @xmath40=-\\frac{d}{2 } \\int_{l } \\int_{l } \\ln |x-\\xi |\\ , \\varphi ^\\prime ( x ) \\varphi ^\\prime ( \\xi ) dx d\\xi -\\int_{l}\\tau \\varphi ( x ) dx+\\kappa \\mu b\\int_{l } |\\varphi^\\prime ( x)| dx,\\ ] ] we formulate the following variational principle : the stable equilibrium distribution of dislocations corresponds to the minimizer @xmath5 of functional under the constraints .",
    "the existence of minimizer is guaranteed by the above mentioned inequality for the quadratic functional provided in @xcite .",
    "symmetry of the problem implies that @xmath5 is even and @xmath41 is odd .",
    "it can be shown that the presence of @xmath42 in the last term of the energy functional causes the minimizer to have the dislocation - free zone as observed in @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that there is a length @xmath43 such that @xmath44 thus , there are two boundary layers where positive and negative dislocations pile up against the obstacles and the dislocation - free zone in - between .",
    "let us first fix the constant value of @xmath5 in @xmath45 , @xmath46 , as well as the length @xmath47 .",
