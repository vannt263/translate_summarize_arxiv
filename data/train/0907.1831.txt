    "two of the simplest quantum systems are the qubit and the harmonic oscillator ( oscillator for brevity ) .",
    "their controlled interaction is realizable in a multitude of settings .",
    "these include cavity - quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , where atomic qubits interact with electromagnetic fields @xcite , circuit - qed , where superconducting qubits interact with microwave resonators @xcite or quantum nano - mechanics where mechanical oscillators interact with superconducting qubits @xcite and atomic qubits @xcite .",
    "it is generally perceived that the oscillators will have to be first cooled to a known pure state and isolated sufficiently from their environments before quantum effects in them can be seen .",
    "however , one can ask the following question in order to lower the demands for controlling quantum systems . how far can cooling and isolation be relaxed ?",
    "we answer this question in the context of entangling two oscillators by a mediating qubit .",
    "this is important for those qubits which do not interact with each other .",
    "the entanglement of the oscillators could then be a resource for entangling qubits and their teleportation @xcite .",
    "additionally , entangling mesoscopic oscillators , as available in quantum nanomechanics , fundamentally probes the boundary of the quantum world .",
    "the most natural initial state of an oscillator is a _",
    "thermal state_. moreover an oscillator _ continuously interacts with its thermal environment _ even while interacting with a qubit .",
    "can one use the available qubit - oscillator interactions to entangle two oscillators in the above situation in a verifiable way ? surprisingly , though work on entangling oscillators initially in  pure states \" is aplenty @xcite , only very recently the first major step in answering the above question has been taken .",
    "refs.@xcite have shown how to entangle two thermal state oscillators by a mediator in a pure state with some heuristic / approximate considerations of decoherence induced by zero temperature baths ( as opposed to a thermal environment ) . however",
    ", wherever thermal states are relevant , the thermal environment is also _",
    "unavoidable_. an exact analytic treatment of this problem by solving the appropriate master equation for a thermal environment is required to go beyond heuristics and ascertaining how the openness of the oscillators and their bath temperature constrain an entanglement generation protocol and its outcome . in this paper",
    ", we show that the above analytic treatment can be achieved by choosing a _ specific form _ of the qubit - oscillator interaction which is naturally available in quantum nanomechanics and can be implemented with minimal effort in cavity / circuit - qed .",
    "together with the inclusion of a thermal environment for the oscillator , our treatment also enables the analytic inclusion of the dephasing of qubits that may be important in a quantum nanomechanical setting .",
    "the scheme we are considering for the entanglement preparation , relying on the strength of resonant interactions , can be faster than that with cross - kerr - like interactions @xcite .",
    "we also find an allowed time window for the entanglement to appear which becomes broad when decoherence and temperature are low .",
    "this can make the scheme more robust to errors in interaction times than most other schemes @xcite .",
    "in addition , we show the possibility of reciprocation of the entanglement of the oscillators to two qubits . thus the generated mixed state of the oscillator",
    "can serve as a resource for qubit based quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "our results should be particularly useful for quantum nanomechanics , where oscillators are yet to be cooled to the ground state . in technologies where preparation of a ground state oscillator is available @xcite , using thermal states",
    "will surely lower the demands on cooling and isolation .",
    "our scheme will show that oscillators in almost classical states can indeed be entangled to provide a qip resource even when they are continuously ( but weakly ) coupled to a thermal environment .",
    "in addition to this , we believe the solution method presented here to be relevant on its own , as it could be applied to a variety of problems involving the same interaction hamiltonian and the same decoherence model .",
    "we start by presenting the schematics of our entanglement generation protocol without specifying the hamiltonian . at first , we let two identical oscillators interact with the same qubit , which we call the _ entangling qubit _ , either sequentially ( such as for an atomic qubit flying through a pair of cavities ) or simultaneously ( such as for a superconducting qubit ) . in the former case",
    "we will assume the two interaction times to be the same .",
    "the states of the qubit are @xmath0 , while the oscillators are described by the annihilation operators @xmath1 .",
    "let the oscillators be initially in a thermal state and the qubit in @xmath2 so that the initial state of the complete system is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 . throughout the paper , the unit of @xmath6 is assumed .",
    "after an interaction between the qubit and the oscillators for a time @xmath7 the system will evolve to @xmath8 . at this point",
    ", we measure the internal state of the qubit to obtain two possible outcomes @xmath9 . as a result",
    "the oscillators are projected in the mixed state @xmath10 .",
    "our aim is to show that for an appropriate interaction , such a state may be entangled by an amount which depends on the temperature @xmath11 and the strength of decoherence .",
    "one could try to detect the entanglement contained in the state @xmath12 , for example by verifying a bell inequality violation by local measurements on the oscillators ( we will discuss how to do this for our specific model ) .",
    "alternatively , one could extract part of the entanglement on to an additional pair of qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( entanglement  reciprocation \" ) , initially in the separable state @xmath15 by making mode @xmath16 interact with qubit @xmath13 and mode @xmath17 with qubit @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the resulting operation alone may not suffice to entangle @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as they will , in general , remain entangled with modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "so we perform additional measurements of momenta @xmath18 or the parities @xmath19 of the two oscillators .",
    "note that no entanglement is created during such reciprocation since the two parts of the system ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are not directly interacting and the measurement is performed locally .",
    "thus measuring @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be entangled is a _ sufficient condition _ for the state @xmath10 to be entangled .",
    "it also demonstrates that the oscillators can store entanglement to be later extracted by qubits .",
    "we present the form of the qubit - oscillator interaction we use , first showing the case of a single oscillator and then generalizing to the case of two oscillators .",
    "the qubit and the oscillator are resonant at frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the interaction picture is : @xmath23 where we have introduced the pauli operators @xmath24 .",
    "this hamiltonian can arise in a jaynes - cummings system by driving it with an external laser @xcite ( this _ revives the counter - rotating terms _ while preserving the strength of the coupling @xcite ) .",
    "it also arises naturally in nanomechanical oscillators coupled to charge qubits ( although in the latter case , a rotation of the qubit basis such that @xmath25 is needed ) .",
    "the time evolution operator is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the displacement operator @xcite ( we can use @xmath28 inside this operator as @xmath29=[a , a^\\dagger]=1 $ ] ) .",
    "if the qubit is interacting with two oscillator modes @xmath1 the previous expression is modified into : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the displacement operator for mode @xmath32 @xcite . if the entangling qubit is measured in @xmath2 or @xmath33 , the resulting operators acting on the oscillators ( combining evolution and measurement ) are @xmath34 the above operators have increasing entangling capabilities as @xmath7 gets larger , as can be seen for example by applying one of them to a product of two coherent states .",
    "+ at this point we include the effect of a thermal environment in our treatment , for which we first get back to the interaction of a single oscillator with a single qubit . introducing decoherence , the dynamics can be described by the master equation : @xmath35+l(t)\\rho+l_\\phi\\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the lindblad operator for the oscillator in a thermal bath at temperature @xmath11 , which will , for cases we consider , be of the amplitude damping form @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the damping rate .",
    "the operator @xmath40 will be present for the case of charge qubits whose dephasing can be significant ( here @xmath28 instead of @xmath41 has been used because for a charge qubit the basis is rotated , as mentioned earlier ) .",
    "the model is analytically solvable , and we think it is worth to present here the solution method in full detail , as it may be applied to other problems involving the same form of interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we switch to the wigner representation of the oscillator defined as @xmath42 this representation is widely used in quantum optics , where the density matrix of a single ( or multi ) mode field is encoded into the real - valued wigner function @xcite .",
    "however , since in this paper we are dealing with a composite system ( oscillator + qubit ) , the state of the system can not be represented by a single function ; it is indeed encoded in a _ @xmath43 matrix of functions _ , which we may call the _ wigner matrix_. the wigner matrix component @xmath44 is defined as the wigner function for the operator @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath44 is not necessarily real valued for @xmath47 ; nevertheless if @xmath48 is a genuine density matrix then the condition @xmath49 holds , i.e. the wigner matrix is hermitian for any @xmath50 .",
    "the master equation for @xmath48 can be converted into a differential equation for @xmath51 by using the following correspondences ( for a rigorous derivation see for example @xcite ) : @xmath52 it follows that the wigner matrix obeys the differential equation @xmath53-\\frac{i}{2}(\\partial_{\\alpha^*}-\\partial_\\alpha)\\{\\sigma_1,w\\}+\\nonumber\\\\ & \\phantom{\\partial_t w}+l(t)w+l_\\phi w,\\label{diffeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the anticommutator @xmath54 .",
    "the lindblad operator in terms of the complex variable @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "note that ( [ diffeq ] ) is indeed a system of coupled differential equations for the four components of the matrix @xmath51 , which can be separated by choosing an appropriate decomposition of @xmath51 in the pauli basis @xmath58 .",
    "in fact we can see that the commutator @xmath59 $ ] in ( [ diffeq ] ) is non - vanishing only if it is applied to the pauli operators @xmath60 , while the anticommutator @xmath61 is non - vanishing only when it is applied to the operators @xmath62 .",
    "it is then a simple step further to verify that @xmath63=\\pm(\\sigma_2\\pm i\\sigma_3),\\\\ & \\{\\sigma_1,1\\pm\\sigma_1\\}=\\pm(1\\pm\\sigma_1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have at this point all the tools we need to write down a decomposition of the wigner matrix in  normal modes  @xmath64 which then yields four decoupled differential equations : @xmath65 we suppose that initially the oscillator is at thermal equilibrium with its environment at temperature @xmath11 , while the qubit is in the ground state . in terms of initial conditions",
    "this translates into @xmath66 these initial conditions allow for a compact solution which we are going to present in full , while the solution for generic initial conditions can be expressed in terms of convolution integrals as discussed in appendix .",
    "equation ( [ v1 ] ) can be solved by choosing an ansatz of the form @xmath67 we know that @xmath68 is such that @xmath69 , and clearly @xmath70 .",
    "thus , if ( [ ansv1 ] ) holds , it follows that @xmath71 by substituting these into eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) and collecting terms proportional to @xmath72 , we obtain the differential equation @xmath73 with initial condition @xmath74 as a consequence of ( [ initials ] ) .",
    "such equation can be easily solved , yielding @xmath75 following the same procedure we obtain @xmath76 for @xmath77 we consider the following ansatz : @xmath78 similar considerations as before allow us to express @xmath79 this time , after substituting such expressions in eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) , we can collect separately the terms proportional to @xmath80 and those proportional to @xmath77 , to obtain the pair of coupled differential equations @xmath81 from ( [ initials ] ) we get the initial conditions @xmath82 , then the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ mu ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) are @xmath83 again , @xmath84 can be solved similarly , yielding @xmath85    at this point we can go back to our original problem and generalize the procedure for a qubit interacting with two oscillators .",
    "we have in this case a master equation for the two - mode wigner matrix @xmath86 .",
    "if we suppose that the two oscillators have the same temperature and the same value of @xmath39 , the solution is obtained from the single mode case by replicating each function , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "note that this last operation implies that the qubit is interacting simultaneously with the two oscillators .",
    "if the interaction is sequential we should consider the delay between the two interactions , which makes the first oscillator decay for longer ( dephasing can usually be neglected for flying qubits ) .",
    "it is not hard to include this effect analytically if needed , however our calculations show that it can be taken into account with good approximation by doubling the damping rate of the oscillators , so that we can present a common treatment for the two settings . the wigner function of the two oscillators after the qubit is measured in @xmath88 is @xmath89 where @xmath90 .    in the reciprocation procedure",
    "the two qubits plus two oscillators are described by a 4x4 wigner matrix , initially given by @xmath91 , and then evolved for a further time @xmath7 ( for simplicity the same as before ) .",
    "similar techniques as above allow to keep the treatment analytical .",
    "the state of the qubits after reciprocation is obtained from the wigner matrix in both cases of our interest . for momentum measurements we use the property @xmath92 which gives the overlap of the density matrix with the momentum eigenstates . in this case",
    "we decompose the complex variables into their respective real and imaginary parts , i.e. @xmath93 , @xmath94 . when measuring parities we use @xmath95 which is a well known alternative definition @xcite .",
    "for example , the two qubit density matrix corresponding to the parity eigenvalues @xmath96 is @xmath97",
    "we proceed to evaluate the entanglement contained in the states prepared at each stage of the protocol .",
    "let us start with state @xmath12 of the two oscillators after the entangling qubit is measured .",
    "we investigate its nonlocal properties by looking for a bell inequality violation .",
    "we consider the measurable quantity @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the probability of measuring the two oscillators with same / opposite parities after having applied the displacements @xmath100 .",
    "this quantity takes values between -1 and 1 and therefore it can be used to form a bell inequality : @xmath101 where @xmath102 are arbitrary complex numbers .",
    "a value of @xmath103 greater than 2 indicates the presence of quantum nonlocal correlations .",
    "the maximum violation for a bipartite system is @xmath104 , corresponding to strong nonlocality . in the limit of large @xmath7 and @xmath105 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath103 is given by @xmath106 corresponding to a set of solutions @xmath107 .",
    ", relative to state @xmath108 as a function of temperature and interaction time .",
    "the case @xmath109 is qualitatively similar .",
    "plot ( a ) corresponds to the ideal case @xmath110 , where the maximum violation compatible with the system s temperature is reached for long enough times . in plot ( b ) @xmath111 as in @xcite , which limits the time window to circa 2 rabi periods and makes the maximum violation drop to approximately 2.4[firstfig],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=24.0% ] , relative to state @xmath108 as a function of temperature and interaction time .",

    "nevertheless if the decoherence and dephasing rates are reasonably small we are still left with a range of times and temperatures which give a value of @xmath103 significantly larger than 2 , as we can see in fig .",

    "the presence of a maximum allowed temperature may be a peculiarity of parity measurements .",

    "we are convinced that the robustness of the protocol relies on the features of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "in fact , as we see in ( [ effective ] ) , it allows us to apply to the oscillators a coherent superposition of displacements in opposite directions , with amplitude proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "we expect to see entanglement between the two oscillators if @xmath7 is larger than the phase space extension of the initial state , even if mixed .",
    "however , large @xmath7 also means more decoherence , thus the competition between these two effects will determine the existence and extension of a time window in which entanglement can be established .",
