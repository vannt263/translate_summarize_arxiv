    "it is well established that an analysis of multicolor photometric data , whereby one compares oscillation amplitudes and/or phase differences in two or more wavebands , can lead to partial mode identification in pulsating stars ( see , e.g. , heynderickx , waelkens , & smeyers 1994 ) .",

    "unfortunately , in that case , the identification of @xmath0 was not possible for the two pulsation modes uncovered because the uncertainties on the observed amplitudes turned out to be too large due to insufficient s / n ratio .",

    "to analyze multicolor data for pulsating sdb stars , we follow the modeling method developed by randall et al .",
    "while we refer the reader to that paper for more information , we include here a brief recap of the most relevant aspects for convenience .",
    "the technique employed is based on the well - known fact that the observed wavelength dependence of an oscillation s amplitude and phase bears the signature of the mode s degree index @xmath0 and its period , as well as the star s atmospheric parameters , the intrinsic amplitude of the periodicity , and its viewing aspect . to first order ,",
    "the influence of the latter two ( unknown ) parameters can be eliminated by computing the ratio of pulsational amplitudes ( and the difference between phases ) as measured in two or more bandpasses . given a target",
    "s effective temperature and surface gravity , the observed mode s degree index can thus , in principle , be inferred from multicolor photometry , leading to partial mode identification .",
    "the method proposed by randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) incorporates a full nonadiabatic description of the atmospheric layers in the computations of theoretical pulsation observables . as in main sequence stars ( e.g. , dupret et al .",
    "2003 ) , such description is found to be quite important in sdb stars as well . in particular , while the predicted phase shifts between various bandpasses generally remain quite small  they would all be identical to zero in the adiabatic approximation  randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that amplitude ratios can not , in that approximation , be computed with enough accuracy for quantitative studies .",
    "furthermore , they found that the amplitude ratios do depend sensitively on the atmospheric parameters of the target , so for the purposes of our present analysis , we need to compute a specific detailed model atmosphere as well as a full pulsation model for each one of our targets .    for each value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the brightness variation expected across the visible disk during a pulsation cycle can be expressed in terms of temperature , radius , and surface gravity perturbations to the emergent flux .",
    "these in turn are dependent on quantities obtainable from model atmospheres and nonadiabatic pulsation theory , as well as on the period of the mode in question ( see , e.g. , equations 34 @xmath24 38 of randall et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the model atmosphere parameters are made up of the logarithmic derivative of the emergent flux with respect to the effective temperature / surface gravity and the weighted limb darkening integral together with its derivatives .",
    "initially computed as monochromatic quantities ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in the notation of randall et al . 2005 ) from a specially modified sdb atmosphere code , they are subsequently integrated over the bandpasses of interest ( the quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 symbolizes the appropriate bandpass , again in the notation of randall et al .",
    "2005 ) to allow for comparison with observations .",
    "the second set of parameters includes the nonadiabatic quantities @xmath23 and @xmath36 , which are related to an oscillation s departure from adiabacity in amplitude and phase respectively . together with the adiabatic gradient , @xmath37 , they are computed on the basis of the so - called `` second generation '' static stellar models described in charpinet et al .",
    "these full models are submitted to adiabatic and nonadiabatic pulsation calculations that yield , among other things , the relative behaviour of the radius ( gravity ) and temperature perturbations in the stellar atmosphere for each mode considered .",
    "integrated over the atmospheric layers contributing most to the emergent flux ( taken to lie at optical depths @xmath38 = 0.1@xmath2410 ) , the ratio of the two perturbations moduli and their phase lag yield the atmosphere - averaged values of @xmath23 and @xmath36 describing the departure from adiabacity of the observed brightness variations for each mode .",
    "the atmospheric value of @xmath37 is obtained in a similar way .    for each reported mode in each observed target , we calculated the predicted amplitude ratios and phase differences from the available bandpasses for values of the degree index from @xmath0 = 0 to @xmath0 = 5 .",
    "since , as it turns out , there is very little information content in the phase shifts ( the predicted differences are indeed too small in all cases of interest to be detectable at the accuracy achieved in the available data sets ) , we concentrate solely in what follows on comparing predicted and observed amplitudes . to provide a quantitative framework for such a comparison , we contrast for each mode the predicted multicolor amplitudes with those observed using a @xmath1 minimization procedure following fontaine et al .",
    "for every degree index @xmath0 , the theoretical amplitudes @xmath39 in each of the @xmath40 available bandpasses @xmath41 are multiplied by a scale factor @xmath42 chosen in such a way as to minimize @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the amplitude observed in a given waveband and @xmath45 is the error on the measurement .",
    "compared to the standard normalization of all amplitudes to one particular waveband , this is a more objective way of determining the quality of a match , since the data from all bandpasses are treated on the same footing .    finally , since our procedure is a standard @xmath1 approach , it is possible , following fontaine et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , to quantify the value of a given @xmath1 solution by computing explicitly the quality - of - fit @xmath2 as described in press et al .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 depends on the value of @xmath1 for each solution and the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath40 fitted points minus the free parameter @xmath42 gives @xmath46 degrees of freedom in the present case ) .",
    "we adopt the canonical notion suggested by press et al .",
    "( 1986 ) that a fit is acceptable if its quality - of - fit @xmath47 . for a system with a single degree of freedom",
    ", this value of @xmath2 corresponds to the case where the predicted amplitudes fall simultaneoulsy in all bandpasses of interest within 3@xmath45 .",
    "hence , we shall use the criterion @xmath47 to determine if a given @xmath1 fit is acceptable and to discriminate quantitatively betweeen possible @xmath0 solutions .",
    "the vital characteristics of each of the seven data sets used in this study are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the first column gives the name of the ec 14026 pulsator , the second one gives its @xmath13 magnitude ( @xmath20 if @xmath13 is unavailable ) , the third one lists the total length of the data set , the fourth column refers to the bandpasses of interest , the fifth one indicates the instrument used , and this is followed by the identification of the telescope used and its location , and finally a reference to the original paper is given .    in the calculations of theoretical amplitudes for each target star ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the atmospheric parameters of the star , log @xmath11 and @xmath48 . to do this",
    ", we rely on the recent and ongoing spectroscopic efforts of green , fontaine , & chayer ( 2006 , in preparation ) to derive reliable and homogeneous atmospheric parameters for a large sample of sdb stars . for each of our target stars",
    ", we used estimates for the atmospheric parameters coming from that study .",
    "these are given in table 2 .",
    "in addition , we indicate in the same table the three ingredients that we used in the convolution process transforming monochromatic quantities into waveband - integrated quantities suitable for comparison with the observational data .",
    "these include the transmission curve of each filter , the response curve of the detector , and the extinction curve of the site .",
    "tests indicate that , by far , the transmission curves of the filters are the most important component , and that , at the other extreme , the choice of the extinction curve is a sophistication that has little impact for sites located at roughly the same altitude . in this connection , we picked the atmospheric transparency curve of a representative medium altitude site ( in this case , kitt peak national observatory ) , a choice that should be appropriate for all but perhaps mt . suhora observatory in poland located at an altitude of about 1000 m. further tests indicate that the largest sources of uncertainty for the computed amplitudes are associated with the uncertainties on @xmath49 and log @xmath11 , assuming that the filters used by the observers have indeed the claimed transmission properties . for typical uncertainties on the atmospheric parameters of @xmath50",
    "= @xmath51 400 k and @xmath52 = @xmath51 0.05 ( this excludes possible systematic effects associated with the model atmospheres used by green et al . 2006 ) , the real effects on the theoretical amplitudes remain quite small and generally not significant enough to affect the implications for mode identification ( given the observational uncertainties on the observed amplitudes ) .    for each data",
    "set , we generally accepted the data , i.e. , the observed multicolor amplitudes and their associated uncertainties at face value .",
    "this implicitly implies that each reported mode was fully resolved and that its amplitudes were free of spectral contamination from neighborhing peaks in the fourier domain .",
    "this is an important issue : if a mode is not sufficiently `` monochromatic '' in frequency , attempts to model its @xmath0 signature as a function of wavelength are usually frustrated .",
    "one exception to this is the case of an unresolved frequency multiplet due to rotational splitting . in that case , since the amplitudes do not depend on the azimuthal order @xmath53 , the modeling remains valid for such an unresolved multiplet in a slowly rotating star .",
    "an equally important concern is the question of the uncertainties on the observed amplitudes . since our approach is based on a @xmath1 statistics , it is absolutely essential to have realistic and accurate estimates of these uncertainties .",
    "the quality of the fit , as measured by the quantity @xmath2 , and which gives the discriminatory power of the method , depends directly on the values of these uncertainties .",
    "we found , in this connection , that our failure sometimes to model in an acceptable way a given pulsation mode could be traced back to the fact that the errors on the amplitudes were probably underestimated .",
    "the paper of k98 is the first one reporting on multicolor photometry for a rapidly pulsating sdb star .",
    "it was a key source of motivation and inspiration for the theoretical work that we presented in randall et al .",
    ". in k98 , the author reported , among other things , on some 27 h of @xmath17 photometry on kpd 2109 + 4401 ( @xmath13 = 13.38 ) gathered with a 4-channel photometer mounted on the mcdonald observatory s 2.1-m struve telescope .",
    "seven distinct pulsation modes were uncovered , and @xmath17 amplitudes and phases were provided for each one of them . the author , however , was clearly reluctant to provide estimates of the uncertainties on the amplitudes and phases , being quite aware , as he argued , that formal errors coming from least - squares fits of light curves tend to be unreliable .",
    "reading between the lines , and using the information on the relative efficiency of each bandpass of the steining photometer that we had from previous work ( fontaine et al .",
    "1996 ) , we established that reasonable estimates of the observational uncertainties on the amplitudes would be @xmath54 = 0.105 mmag , @xmath55 = 0.105 mmag , @xmath56 = 0.085 mmag , and @xmath57 = 0.155 mmag , irrespective of the amplitude of a given mode .",
    "table 3 summarizes the results of our modeling effort for the k98 data set .",
    "filters of the steining photometer as published in robinson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for this analysis .",
    "these are similar but not exactly the same as the standard johnson - cousins filters . ] for each observed mode , the table gives a block of data .",
    "the first line in each block gives the period of the mode of interest , and this is followed by the observed amplitude and its uncertainty in each of the available bandpass .",
    "the next line gives the best - fit theoretical amplitude in each of the bandpass for an assumed degree index @xmath0 = 0 , and this is followed by the value of @xmath1 obtained in the minimization procedure ( eq .",
    "1 ) , and the value of the quality - of - fit @xmath2 . the next five lines show similar data , but for assumed values of @xmath0 from 1 to 5 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 is a graphical representation of our results for the 182.42 s mode ( the first one listed in table 3 and the second largest amplitude one in the k98 data ) .",
    "the observed behavior of that mode is well modeled for values of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , or @xmath60 as can be seen in the figure .",
    "the plot is consistent , of course , with the values of @xmath2 all larger than 0.001 for those three possibilities , while it also clearly shows the poor fits ( @xmath61 ; see table 3 ) obtained for models assuming @xmath6 , @xmath5 , or @xmath62 .",
    "we thus find that , while the uncertainties on the observed amplitudes are too large for us to discriminate between the values of @xmath0 from 0 to 2 , we can safely discard the possibilities that the 182.42 s mode in kpd 2109 + 4401 has a degree index of 3 , 4 , or 5 .",
    "we note that this result is consistent with the determination of @xmath58 proposed by randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for that mode on the basis of the the much higher s / n ratio data of jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the highest amplitude mode in the k98 data is the 196.31 s pulsation which , interestingly enough but not uncommonly in sdb pulsators , showed smaller amplitudes than the 182.42 s mode when kpd 2109 + 4401 was observed by jeffery et al .",
    "our modeling of the k98 data shows a very similar situation to the previous mode as can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "again , we can not formally discriminate between @xmath58 , @xmath59 , or @xmath60 , but we can safely exclude the possibilities that the 196.31 s mode in kpd 2109 + 4401 has a value of @xmath6 , @xmath5 , or @xmath62 .",
    "the very small values of @xmath2 associated with these solutions ( table 3 ) certainly confirm this conclusion .",
    "the most interesting case in the k98 data is that of the 198.19 s mode ( the third largest amplitude mode ) , which shows an amplitude - wavelength behavior characteristic of a @xmath5 mode as can be appreciated in figure 3 .",
    "in fact , formally speaking , the @xmath5 solution is the only one acceptable , with a value of @xmath63 in table 3 .",
    "while this remains highly suggestive , we caution that one should not jump too hastily to the conclusion that mode discrimination has been achieved beyond any doubt for that mode .",
    "the reason for our cautionary remark is that the next best fit , the one corresponding to @xmath60 and @xmath64 in table 3 , does not show a quality - of - fit value that is much smaller than the passage criterion of @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , if we were to increase the uncertainties on the observed amplitudes by some 10% , the solution with @xmath60 would become formally acceptable .",
    "so here is a case where realistic and accurate estimates of the amplitude uncertainties become critical .    for the other modes uncovered in k98 , we formally constrain the value of @xmath0 to 0 , 1 , 2 , or 4 for the 184.72 s pulsation , to 2 or 4 for the 184.75 s pulsation , and to 1 , 2 , or 4 for the 191.85 s pulsation .",
    "no mode discrimination was possible for the lowest amplitude mode at 196.69 s , and all values of @xmath0 from 0 to 5 provide acceptable fits .",
    "we note that the provisionary @xmath0 assignments made by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on the basis of their _ ultracam_/wht observations are consistent with our more quantitative results here for all modes , except perhaps for the 198.19 s pulsation for which we may have isolated a unique value at @xmath66 , although , as discussed just above , the @xmath60 solution ( which is the suggestion of jeffery et al .",
    "2004 for that mode ) should not be dismissed too hastily .",
    "amplitude and phase data were reported for two modes ( 139.3 s and 143.9 s ) observed in pg 1618 + 563b ( @xmath13 = 13.52 ) by s00 . those were derived from @xmath18 observations using the 3-channel tromso photometer attached to the 2.5-m not telescope .",
    "unfortunately , only 1.5 h of data were gathered and , consequently , the s / n ratio was not large enough to allow @xmath0 index discrimination .",
    "our results are summarized in table 4 ( the format is similar to that of table 3 ) and clearly show that all possible @xmath0 values from 0 to 5 provide acceptable fits for both modes .",
    "figure 4 gives a graphical representation of our results for the 139.3 s mode .",
    "the relatively bright ( @xmath13 = 12.92 ) , large - amplitude sdb pulsator pg 1605 + 072 has been observed by f03 who provided 12.3 h of _ busca _ photometry , a 4-channel system allowing the simultaneous observations in bandpasses centered on 3600 (@xmath67 ) , 4800 (@xmath20 ) , 6300 (@xmath23 ) , and 8000 (@xmath68 ) .",
    "these data were gathered at the 2.2-m telescope at calar alto . f03 isolated 11 modes in their light curves and provided measurements of amplitudes and phases in their tables 2 and 3 . however",
    ", only 5 of those modes have simultaneous measurements in all the 4 _ busca _ bandpasses .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to these 5 modes .    in our modeling effort , we were careful to convolve the transmission curves of the 4 filters with the response curve of the _ busca _ instrument as provided to us by o. cordes ( 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "we also point out that the estimates of the atmospheric parameters that we used for pg 1605 + 072 ( see table 2 ) are remarkably consistent with the independent values obtained by heber , reid , & werner ( 1999 ) , which are @xmath48 = 32,300 @xmath51 300 k and log @xmath11 = 5.25 @xmath51 0.05 dex .    despite careful modeling",
    ", we were unable to reproduce satisfactorily the amplitude - wavelength behaviors of all 5 modes when using the amplitudes and their uncertainties given in tables 2 and 3 of f03 .",
    "in all 5 cases , and for all assumed values of @xmath0 from 0 to 5 , we obtained unacceptable quality - of - fit values of @xmath61 . while we can not completely rule out the possibility that our modeling is inadequate for this particular star , we believe instead that this problem is related to the fact that the amplitude uncertainties quoted by f03 most likely underestimate the true errors .",
    "in fact , the authors of f03 seem to be aware of that and provide two other different estimates of the amplitude uncertainties .",
    "for instance , they explicitly write that the quoted uncertainties on the reported amplitudes in their tables 2 and 3 are formal fit errors from a least - squares sine fit procedure , while the ( much larger ) uncertainties shown in their figure 5 for 4 different modes have been estimated in another way .",
    "furthermore , f03 write in their subsection 3.2 that the 1@xmath69 noise level in their photometry corresponds to 1.52 mmag in the @xmath67 bandpass , 1.53 mmag in @xmath20 , 1.12 mmag in @xmath23 , and 1.37 mmag in @xmath68 , which is clearly at odds with the much smaller formal fit errors reported in their tables .",
    "we used these last figures to derive more realistic estimates of the amplitude uncertainties for the f03 data set .",
    "to this end , we adopted the recipe of montgomery & odonoghue ( 1999 ) , which suggests that the amplitude uncertainty should be equal to about 0.8 times the 1@xmath69 noise level , irrespective of the actual amplitude of a mode .",
    "this leads to @xmath70 = 1.22 mmag , @xmath55 = 1.22 mmag , @xmath57 = 0.90 mmag , and @xmath71 = 1.10 mmag .",
    "we note that these correspond to values 10 to 25 times larger than the formal fit errors quoted by f03 in their tables 2 and 3 , a huge difference perhaps in line with the reluctance shown by k98 to quote realistic errors for this type of data . while the approach of montgomery & odonoghue ( 1999 ) is conservative , we believe that it leads to more realistic estimates of the amplitude uncertainties in this case , and we have consequently redone our analysis of the f03 data set with these revised values .",

    "this data set was gathered with the dedicated strmgren photometer attached to the 0.9-m telescope at the sierra nevada observatory .",
    "our attempts to model the amplitude - wavelength behaviors of the two pulsation modes reported by o05 ( see their table 5 ) were frustrated and no acceptable fits were found for any of the assumed @xmath0 values from 0 to 5 .",
    "table 7 summarizes our results and clearly indicates that our quality - of - fit values @xmath2 are completely unacceptable .",
    "figure 11 illustrates graphically the situation for the largest amplitude mode ( 356.3 s ) .",
    "again , as in the case of pg 1605 + 072 discussed above , we can not exclude completely the possibility that our modeling is inadequate for bal 090100001 , but we rather strongly suspect that the quoted amplitude uncertainties in table 5 of o05 ( most likely formal fit errors ) underestimate largely the true errors .",
    "unfortunately , unlike the case of pg 1605 + 072 in f03 , not enough information is given in o05 that would have allowed us to obtain perhaps more realistic estimates of the amplitude uncertainties .",
    "thus , we must conclude that we can not model adequately the data of o05 as presented by them .",
    "bal 090100001 was also observed by b05 who , in a major effort , gathered more than 126 h of @xmath17 photometry on the 0.6-m telescope of the mt .",
    "suhora observatory in poland .",
    "the authors uncovered many periodicities , including not only short - period pulsations characteristic of ec 14026 stars , but also long - period oscillations most likely due to @xmath11-mode pulsations as found in the pg 1716 stars ( and see also o05 ) .",
    "we have concentrated our modeling effort on the 9 short - period modes ( labelled @xmath79 through @xmath80 in b05 ) with reliable amplitude determinations in all four bandpasses .",
    "we note that the authors provided a very careful frequency analysis and that they adopted the approach of montgomery & odonoghue ( 1999 ) for estimating the uncertainties on the reported amplitudes and phases . for the amplitudes ,",
    "this leads to @xmath54 = 0.25 mmag , @xmath55 = 0.18 mmag , @xmath56 = 0.16 mmag , and @xmath57 = 0.17 mmag , irrespective of the actual amplitudes of a given mode .",
    "the light curve of bal 090100001 , as observed by b05 , is dominated by a very large amplitude mode ( the largest ever observed so far in a sdb pulsator ) with a period of 356.19 s. its color amplitudes are @xmath22 = 75.23 mmag , @xmath20 = 57.71 mmag , @xmath13 = 53.34 mmag , and @xmath23 = 50.26 mmag ( see table 1 of b05 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , b05 also report the detection of the first and second harmonic of that mode , the first with an amplitude larger than 6 of the 9 modes we retained for analysis .",
    "the dominant mode appears to be isolated , whereas the three next largest ones ( 354.20 s , 354.01 s , and 353.81 s ) appear to form an almost perfectly symmetric triplet in frequency space , leading to the suggestion that this triplet could be due to rotational splitting .",
    "considering that the main mode does not show an equivalent multiplet structure , this led b05 to suggest that the 356.19 s mode could be a @xmath58 mode , while the triplet would correspond to a rotationally - split @xmath59 pulsation .",
    "it is obviously of high interest to verify if these sensible suggestions could be proven true .    to model the data of b05",
    ", we adopted the atmospheric parameters given in table 2 ( @xmath48 = 29,810 k and log @xmath11 = 5.58 ) , and we convolved our basic monochromatic quantities with the standard transmission curves of the johnson / cousins filters , the kpno extinction curve , and a gray response for the ccd detector since , in the latter case , we had no information as to the exact response curve of the detector .",
    "the results of our effort for the 9 modes retained are summarized in table 8 .",
    "in addition , we include here figures 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 that refer , respectively , to the main mode and the triplet mentioned above .",
    "the other modes have relatively low amplitudes and it becomes increasingly difficult to discrimate between the possible values of @xmath0 for them .",
    "figure 12 illustrates our results for the main mode .",
    "formally speaking , all model fits shown in the figure for that mode must be rejected since @xmath61 for all values of @xmath0 considered in our simulations . at the same time , the figure also clearly illustrates that the solution must be either @xmath81 or @xmath59 .",
    "we note that if the reported amplitude uncertainties are multiplied by a factor of 3.5 ( to mimic the possibility that these uncertaities have been perhaps underestimated ) , then the solutions @xmath58 and @xmath59 become formally acceptable , while the others can be safely discarded .",
    "however , we have no particularly good reason to believe that the uncertainties on the amplitudes would have been underestimated by such a relatively large amount in this data set .",
    "let us consider instead the data at face value and examine if we can rise up to the challenge offered by this very high s / n observation .    the first obvious possibility to improve the match between the data points and one ( @xmath58 ) or the other ( @xmath59 ) of the possible solutions is to vary the model parameters within reasonable ranges , in particular the values of the atmospheric parameters @xmath48 and log @xmath11 that we assumed for bal 090100001 .",
    "the values of these parameters , as derived by green et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , are @xmath48 = 29,810 @xmath51 400 k and log @xmath11 = 5.58 @xmath51 0.05 .",
    "explicit calculations within these bounds indicate that the situation is not changed at the qualitative level : the values of @xmath1 for the @xmath58 and @xmath82 solutions remain within a factor of 2 of each other as in table 8 , and the values of @xmath2 are not significantly improved .",
    "the same is true by redoing the modeling exercise using , this time , the different set of atmospheric parameters derived by oreiro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , i.e. , @xmath48 = 29,450 @xmath51 500 k and log @xmath11 = 5.33 @xmath51 0.10 . in that case , the solution must again be either @xmath58 or @xmath83 , and the respective @xmath1 values are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , both comparable to each other , but still way too high to be formally acceptable as their associated @xmath2 values are much smaller than the criterion level of 0.001 .",
    "we also experimented with changing the extinction curve from that of kpno to one appropriate at sea level and found very little changes in our theoretical amplitudes . likewise , assuming a specific ccd response , instead of using a flat gray response as we did in our initial calculations , also led to very little qualitative changes compared to the situation depicted in figure 12 and table 8 .",
    "( in that latter experiment , we did not use the response curve of the ccd employed by b05 since it was not available to us , but that of ccd21 of steward observatory as a surrogate . )",
    "thus , we are unable to find a formally acceptable ( @xmath63 ) @xmath0 model for the main pulsation mode in bal 090100001 , but we still conclude that it must be either a @xmath86 or a @xmath59 oscillation .    this failure to model properly the main oscillation observed in bal 090100001 is somewhat bothersome ( assuming again that the reported amplitude uncertainties are realistic estimates ) .",
    "we remind the reader that randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using the exact same tools as those used in this paper , have been able to model successfully the 182.42 s mode _ ultracam _",
    "data reported by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for kpd 2109 + 4401 .",
    "we can think of a potentially important difference between the two cases , however , and it is the fact that the amplitude of the dominant mode in bal 090100001 is so large that nonlinear effects are obviously present in the form of the first and second harmonics .",
    "no such nonlinear features have been observed in kpd 2109 + 4401 .",
    "the theory used to determine amplitude ratios between different bandpasses is strictly linear , and it is possible , although this remains unproven , that it becomes inadequate to treat very large amplitude oscillations such as the 356.19 s mode in bal 090100001 .    figures 13 , 14 , and 15 show our model fits for the triplet of modes which has been interpreted as a rotationally - split @xmath59 mode by b05 .",
    "taking again the data at face value , we find ( see table 8) that the 354.20 s mode has @xmath60 , the 354.01 s mode has a value of @xmath0 of either 1 or 2 , and the 353.81 s component has a value of @xmath0 of either 1 , 2 , or 4 . if , however , the amplitude uncertainties are somewhat underestimated , then the @xmath59 possibility for the 354.20 s mode should not be dismissed too hastily because its @xmath2 value would not be much smaller than the passage value of @xmath65 .",
    "because of this , we prefer to be conservative and conclude that if the observed triplet of modes is indeed due to rotational splitting , then it must have a value of either @xmath59 or @xmath60 . in the latter case , an unfavorable observation angle or some other cause could perhaps hide two components of the quintuplet .",
    "we have thus been unable to confirm the suggestion of b05 that the dominant 356.19 s mode in bal 090100001 is a radial mode , and that the 354.20 , 354.01 , and 353.81 s modes are the components of a rotationally - split @xmath59 mode .",
    "our results are nevertheless consistent with that suggestion , but we found that the dominant mode could also have a degree index of @xmath82 while the triplet could be three components of a split @xmath60 mode .",
    "the case of pg 0014 + 067 is particularly interesting because a specific asteroseismic model has been proposed by brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) including , of course , complete mode identification .",
    "this model has been refined subsequently by charpinet et al .",
    "( 2005c ) who exploited a higher quality ( white light ) data set and found the same mode identification . in both cases , in the search in parameter space for the optimal model , it was explicitly assumed that the observed modes had to belong to degree indices from @xmath58 up to and including @xmath6 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath6 was deemed necessary because the observed mode density in pg 0014 + 067 is too large to be explained solely in terms of modes with @xmath58 , 1 , and 2 . in other words , there are more observed modes in the relevant period window of pg 0014 + 067 than there are theoretical periods with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , and 2 , so there seemed to be no choice but conclude that some additional modes with @xmath87 are excited to visible levels in that star . except for the restriction to @xmath0 values from 0 to 3",
    ", no a priori constraints were imposed in the asteroseismological exercises carried out by brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and charpinet et al .",
    "( 2005c ) , and the actual mode identification ( the determination of both the radial order @xmath19 and the degree index @xmath0 for each observed pulsation ) came out as a natural byproduct of the method .    the results of brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) correspond to the first claimed successful asteroseismological exercise for a pulsating sdb star , and the importance of testing the proposed seismic model of pg 0014 + 067 can not be overstated .",
    "it is in this spirit that j05 decided to attempt testing the @xmath0 identification inferred in brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using multicolor photometry . even though the authors of j05 realized",
    "fully that , at @xmath88 16 , pg 0014 + 067 was going to be a challenge , they thought the matter to be sufficiently important to invest almost 30 h of wht time using the _ ultracam _ camera .",
    "it would have been difficult to do better than they did on this from an observational point of view . as in the previous targets studied in this paper , the details of their data set",
    "are given in table 1 .",
    "j05 isolated some 10 distinct pulsation modes in pg 0014 + 067 , and we modeled each one of these pulsations using the parameters listed in table 2 .    not unexpectedly , our analysis reveals that most of the observed modes in pg 0014 + 067 can not be tested for @xmath0 identification as the measured amplitudes usually do not have high enough s / n ratios .",
    "the details of our quantitative analysis are presented in table 9 for the 10 modes of interest . at the same time",
    ", our work also indicates that partial @xmath0 discrimination is possible for the three largest amplitude modes uncovered by j05 , and we show our model fits for these modes in figure 16 ( 141.01 s ) , figure 17 ( 141.06 s ) , and figure 18 ( 146.50 s ) .",
    "we find that the observed amplitudes of the 141.01 s mode can be accommodated if the degree index @xmath0 has a value of either 0 , 1 , 2 , or 4 .",
    "this agrees with the conclusion of j05 that this mode ( the @xmath89 mode in their notation ) can not have a value of @xmath6 , and indeed we find that @xmath90 for that model , much too small to be acceptable .",
    "we also find that the 141.06 s mode ( @xmath91 in j05 ) has a value of @xmath0 of either 0 , 1 , or 2 , again in agreement with the inference made in j05 . finally , we find that the observed amplitude - wavelength distribution of the 146.50 s mode ( @xmath92 in j05 ) can be quantitatively explained if the mode has a @xmath0 value of either 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "this again is consistent with j05 who found that this mode can not be a mode with @xmath6 or @xmath5 .",
    "the most interesting result of this analysis is the conclusion , first put forward by j05 , that the 141.06 s mode ( observed as the 141.07 s mode in the lower resolution white light data of brassard et al . 2001 ) can not have a degree index of @xmath6 . given that brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) formally identified this mode as a @xmath6 pulsation , this implies that a reevalution of their seismic model is warranted .",
    "it should be pointed out that at the time of the analysis of brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the theory of multicolor photometry had not yet been applied to realistic models of pulsating sdb stars . using an eddington limb darkening law ( instead of an exact form coming from detailed sdb model atmospheres ) , brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimated that the visibility factor would be equal to 1.0000 , 0.7083 , 0.3250 , 0.0625 , and 0.0208 respectively for modes with @xmath58 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "hence , the @xmath6 modes would be more than three times `` more visible '' than their @xmath5 counterparts , and it was deemed natural to limit the search to modes with @xmath6 beyond those with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , and 2 since this was now sufficient to account for the relatively high density of observed modes .    what we learned in randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , among many other things , is that the visibility of a @xmath10-mode with @xmath5 is , in fact , substantially larger than that of a @xmath6 mode in a sdb pulsator _ in the optical domain_. the discussion of figure 1 in randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is quite explicit about this .",
    "hence , it will be necessary in future asteroseismological exercises concerning ec 14026 pulsators ( especially those showing more modes than could be accommodated by invoking the presence of only modes with @xmath58 , 1 , and 2 ) to include the possibility that the detected modes could also have values of @xmath5 as they have a higher probability of being detected than the @xmath6 modes .",
    "in particular , a reanalysis of the data presented by brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and charpinet et al .",
    "( 2005c ) on pg 0014 + 067 including this possibility must be carried out .",
    "this is being done and will be reported in due time .",
    "we have presented in this paper a quantitative and homogeneous analysis of the broadband multicolor photometric data sets gathered so far on rapidly pulsating sdb ( ec 14026 ) stars .",
    "this analysis was carried out within the theoretical framework developed by randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) with the goal of partial mode identification , i.e. , the determination of the degree index @xmath0 of each of the observed pulsation modes . with the exception of the very high s / n ratio @xmath12/_ultracam _ data set obtained by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on kpd 2109 + 4401 ( an analysis of which will be presented in a separate publication ) , we considered all available data that we could find in the literature .",
    "this consists of 7 distinct data sets pertaining to 6 different ec 14016 stars and involving 41 pulsation modes .",
    "our final results are summarized in table 10 where we list the name of the target star ( 1st column ) , the period of the mode of interest ( 2nd column ) , the acceptable values of @xmath0 for that mode ( 3rd column ) , and a qualifier as to the level of mode discrimination achieved ( 4th column ) .",
    "it can be seen that no completely convincing and unambiguous @xmath0 identification has been possible on the basis of the available data , although we came close to that goal in the case of two modes in kpd 2109 + 4401 ( k98 ) and three modes in bal 090100001 ( b05 ) for which only two possible values of @xmath0 were found to be consistent with the observed amplitude - wavelength distributions . at the same time",
    ", we found that no mode discrimination ( between values from @xmath86 to @xmath93 ) was possible for 16 out of 41 modes .",
    "there is no doubt that these disappointing ( but perhaps not totally unexpected ) results are due to the fact that the available data sets were of insufficient sensitivity .",
    "the exception is the data set of b05 which features a remarkably high s / n value for the largest amplitude mode ( 356.19 s ) uncovered in that study .",
    "we speculate here that nonlinear effects ( observed in the form of the first and second harmonic of that mode ) may have undermined our ability to model properly the amplitude - wavelength behavior of that particular mode .",
    "the latter shows an exceptionally large amplitude by ec 14026 star standards .",
    "we recall , in this context , that the feasibility of our approach has been demonstrated beyond any doubt by randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in their analysis of the 182.42 s mode measured by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in kpd 2109 + 4401 .",
    "hence , the case of the 356.19 s mode in bal 090100001 remains enigmatic .",
    "it is interesting to examine the statistics of the numbers shown in table 10 .",
    "considering only those cases where partial mode discrimination has been possible , we find that the @xmath81 solution comes up 19 times , the @xmath59 solution 23 times , the @xmath60 solution 24 times , the @xmath4 solution 3 times , the @xmath3 solution 13 times , and the @xmath93 solution once . while no single @xmath0 index identification has been achieved in our study , one can argue , from a strictly statistical point of view , that these results are certainly consistent with the view that the pulsations seen in rapidly pulsating sdb stars are low - degree modes , mostly with values of @xmath86 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "this is not a great surprise by any means , but it confirms the early interpretation of the ec 14026 phenomenon in terms of low - order , low - degree @xmath10-mode pulsations as presented by charpinet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . moreover , the higher frequency of @xmath3 solutions compared to that of @xmath6 solutions is consistent with the finding of randall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that the former modes are more visible than the latter ( in the optical domain ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that in order to exploit the full potential of multicolor photometry for ec 14026 pulsators , it will be necessary in the future to gather higher s / n ratio observations than has been done up to now .",
    "this is certainly within reach , however , as our results clearly imply .",

    "<S> we present a quantitative and homogeneous analysis of the broadband multicolor photometric data sets gathered so far on rapidly pulsating hot b subdwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> this concerns seven distinct data sets related to six different stars . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is carried out within the theoretical framework developed by randall et al . , which includes full nonadiabatic effects . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this analysis is partial mode identification , i.e. , the determination of the degree index @xmath0 of each of the observed pulsation modes . </S>",
    "<S> we assume possible values of @xmath0 from 0 to 5 in our calculations . for each target star , we compute a specific model atmosphere and a specific pulsation model using estimates of the atmospheric parameters coming from time - averaged optical spectroscopy . for every assumed value of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we use a formal @xmath1 approach to model the observed amplitude - wavelength distribution of each mode , and we compute a quality - of - fit @xmath2 probability to quantify the derived fit and to discriminate objectively between the various solutions . we find that no completely convincing and unambiguous @xmath0 identification is possible on the basis of the available data , although partial mode discrimination has been reached for 25 out of the 41 modes studied . </S>",
    "<S> a brief statistical study of these results suggests that a majority of the modes must have @xmath0 values of 0 , 1 , and 2 , but also that modes with @xmath3 could very well be present while modes with @xmath4 appear to be rarer . </S>",
    "<S> this is in line with recent results showing that @xmath5 modes in rapidly pulsating b subdwarfs have a higher visibility in the optical domain than modes with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> although somewhat disappointing in terms of mode discrimination , our results still suggest that the full potential of multicolor photometry for @xmath0 identification in pulsating subdwarfs is within reach </S>",
    "<S> . it will be a matter of gathering higher s / n ratio observations than has been done up to now . </S>"
