    "this is our tribute to the memory of per bak , great scientist and an exceptional personality .",
    "his main contribution to science is the discovery of a new , very broad class of nonlinear deterministic systems displaying stable chaotic critical behavior , which he called self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "it is difficult to overestimate the significance of this discovery , which has opened new ways for explanation and unified description of very remote phenomena , such as earthquakes , plastic deformations , hysteresis in magnets , dynamics of biosphere and financial catastrophes .",
    "the introduced by per notion of avalanches is now central for dynamics of such systems and is most probably a main source of the @xmath0 noise .",
    "theory of these systems has deserved a wide popularity and per is one of the most cited physicists .",
    "+ however , his moral influence in the scientific community was not less important than his scientific contribution . he always was surrounded by people seeking new ways in different fields : geologists , biologists , physicians , economists , historians and , certainly physicists .",
    "everybody felt himself free in this community to criticize everything and to propose new ideas , but per s authority and respect to him was extremely high .",
    "it was based on his uncompromising pursuing of truth and hate to any falsehood in science as well as in social and personal life .",
    "once he was shown by a big tv company at jfk airport expressing his indignation by the violation of passenger rights .",
    "he was a brave and noble man .",
    "he could be very harsh in discussions , a feature , which not everybody could tolerate .",
    "however , per was a reliable , friendly and responsive person ready to help if there was a need in his help , and for this purpose he could spend his time , money and influence .",
    "we feel that his death has left a vacancy in our community , which will not be filled .",
    "in this review we consider a simple , but rather wide - spread phenomenon : the hysteresis mediated by a motion of an interface or domain wall ( dw ) driven by an external alternating force in a medium with random pinning centers .",
    "the interplay between the driving force and elastic and pinning forces develops in time .",
    "if the driving force is constant , it can establish an average velocity of the dw after a sufficiently long time interval . in the case of the alternating force",
    "this time may be longer or shorter than period of oscillations resulting in different regimes .",
    "the influence of a heat reservoir gives an additional dimension to this phenomenon .",
    "the interface is a typical system displaying the soc@xcite : in the absence of the external force it exhibits a fractional structure . a small force results in avalanches on spatial and temporal scales depending on the force .",
    "the stronger is the force and the higher is the frequency the weaker is the influence of the avalanches , but they are crucial for the range of small frequencies and amplitudes important in the experiment . +",
    "this problem is a part of a very old hysteresis problem @xcite occurring in many different dynamical processes : chemical reactions , magnetization reversal , crystal growth , absorption and desorption etc .",
    ", in which many dw are involved . in this case the interaction between walls must be taken in account .",
    "it is beyond the scope of our consideration , but some rough estimates can be done on the basis of one - dw theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent experimental development with its tendency to sub - micron spatial scale generated many small systems in which the motion of one or few dw is absolutely realistic .",
    "moreover , the motion of an individual domain wall was experimentally discovered and studied by several groups of experimenters @xcite .",
    "therefore , theory of such a motion is necessary for understanding of the observed phenomena and prediction of new ones .",
    "+ though the observation of the hysteresis in the ferromagnets accounts more than 100 years history , the phenomenon could not be satisfactory explained until the end of 20-th century , when a theory of dw and its motion in a random medium was developed .",
    "therefore we start our review with an introductory section briefly describing this theory . in the next section we consider a dw moving adiabatically at zero temperature .",
    "adiabatic motion means that the frequency of the driving force is small enough and the momentarily velocity is equal to its stationary value at a constant force equal to the momentarily value of the ac force .",
    "the third section is dedicated to the influence of finite temperature , but still in adiabatic regime . in the fourth section",
    "we consider non - adiabatic regime predict a new phenomenon : the hysteresis of velocity ( magnetization rate in the case of a ferromagnet ) . in the last section we review relevant experiments .",
    "for definiteness we consider a dw in an impure ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy at zero temperature . as it was shown in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , equation of motion for a domain wall without overhangs",
    "can be written in a following way @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the interface position ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the domain wall mobility and stiffness , respectively ; @xmath5 is the external driving force . for a ferromagnet @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the external magnetic field and @xmath8 is the magnetization .",
    "finally @xmath9 denotes the random force generated by the impurities . for broad domain walls @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the dimensionality of the wall . for narrow walls",
    "@xmath4 depends in general on @xmath12 , and the disorder strength in a complicated way @xcite .",
    "+ the random forces @xmath13 generated by pinning centers obey the gaussian statistics and have short range correlations : @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes a delta - function smeared out over a distance @xmath16 .",
    "the initial correlator @xmath17 is an even analytical function of @xmath18 , which decays to zero over a finite distance @xmath16 and has maximum at @xmath19 .",
    "+ in the following we assume that the disorder is weak , i.e. that @xmath20 . under this assumption",
    "the interface is essentially flat on length scales @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath22 is the so - called larkin length . on larger scales the wall adapts to the disorder and",
    "gets pinned for driving fields @xmath23 with @xmath24 for the pinning threshold .",
    "the transverse displacement @xmath25 of the dw at the scale @xmath26 is determined by the roughness exponent @xmath27 : @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the characteristic time of an avalanche @xmath30 at the scale @xmath26 is determined by the dynamic exponent @xmath31 : @xmath32 .",
    "+ if @xmath5 exceeds @xmath33 , the wall starts to move .",
    "close to the depinning transition the velocity , which can be considered as an order parameter of the transition , vanishes according to a power law @xmath34 here we introduced the characteristic velocity scale @xmath35 .",
    "the moving domain wall conserves the rough ( fractal ) structure at length scales between @xmath36 and a new scale established by small velocity @xmath37 , where the pinning force dominates . at larger scales",
    "the bumps on the dw are healed and it becomes smooth .",
    "+ the functional renormalization group calculations @xcite@xcite@xcite show that @xmath38 , i.e. the dynamics close to the depinning transition is _ super - diffusive _ , reflecting the rapid motion of the object after the maximum of the potential has been overcome .",
    "the critical exponents satisfy new scaling relations @xcite @xmath39 these exponents were calculated first to order @xmath40 in @xcite and recently to order @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "+ in the opposite regime @xmath44 the problem is essentially linear and @xmath18 can be replaced by @xmath45 in the argument of @xmath46 .",
    "this can be seen qualitatively as follows : on the time scale @xmath47 the domain wall advances on average by an amount @xmath45 .",
    "randomly distributed pinning centers will lead to a local distortion which , according to dynamical scaling , spreads over a region @xmath48 . the local retardation or advancement of the object due to the fluctuation in the density of the pinning centers scales as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the basic frequency at the larkin length .",
    "since @xmath51 , @xmath52 grows more slowly than @xmath45 .",
    "thus on time scales @xmath53 and length scales @xmath54 the non - linearities in the argument of @xmath55 can be neglected and the linearized theory applies . in this case @xmath56 is replaced by @xmath45 in the argument of the random forces .",
    "random forces act then as a thermal noise with the temperature @xmath57 .",
    "+ after integrating out the interface fluctuations on the length scales @xmath58 , the effective equation of motion for the interface profile @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the spatial and time average over scales @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , on large scales coincides formally with ( [ eq:1 ] ) with some values substituted by their renormalized counterparts : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the influence of the random field on these length scales is negligible .",
    "next we consider the influence of thermal noise on the interface motion .",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to a no - zero velocity of the domain wall even at small forces .",
    "all changes in @xmath5 are still assumed to be made _",
    "adiabatically_. the right - hand side of equation of motion ( [ eq:1 ] ) must be complemented by _ thermal noise _ @xmath65 normalized as usual : @xmath66 in the absence of external driving force the typical free energy fluctuations of the length scale @xmath26 are of the order @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the _ energy barriers _ between different metastable states scale have the same order of magnitude . when the driving force @xmath5 switches on , it changes barriers between neighboring metastable states at the scale @xmath26 by the value @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the total energy barrier is : @xmath70 where we introduced the force length scale @xmath71 a schematic graph of @xmath72 vs. @xmath5 is shown in figure [ fig : e_b ] , it has a maximum at @xmath73 and vanishes for @xmath74 .",
    "the maximal height of the barrier is : @xmath75 it must be overcome by thermally activated hopping to initiate motion .",
    "the _ creep velocity _ of the domain wall follows from @xmath76 . according to the arrhenius law ,",
    "the hopping time is @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath78\\ , .",
    "$ ] we have omitted a prefactor , which is beyond our accuracy .",
    "this formula is valid for @xmath79 and was found first by ioffe and vinokur@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the opposite case @xmath80",
    "we expect a linear relation between the driving force and the velocity : @xmath81 .",
    "the border line between the two cases i.e. the inflection point of the curve @xmath82 , @xmath83 , defines a _ temperature dependent force _",
    "@xmath84 ( compare figure 1 . )",
    "@xmath85 note that the creep formula is valid only for @xmath86 .",
    "+ let us now consider the influence of thermal fluctuations on the depinning transition . at @xmath87 and",
    "@xmath88 the velocity is zero , but one has to expect that as soon as thermal fluctuations are switched on , the velocity will become finite . scaling theory predicts in this case an ansatz @xcite ( generalizing ( [ eq : v ] ) ) @xmath89 with @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is a new exponent which still has to be determined .",
    "+ it is worthwhile to note that relevant thermal fluctuations , which unpin the domain wall act on scales of the order of @xmath96 as was first indicated by a. middleton @xcite . at the critical point @xmath97 essentially only barriers on the scale @xmath98 are left as we saw earlier .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider only this length scale .",
    "a detailed analysis of the form of the effective potential on this scale gives @xmath99 .",
    "in this section we describe the motion of a dw , rectilinear at large scale @xcite .",
    "the reason of the motion is the alternating driving force , which we assume to have a simple harmonic shape : @xmath100 . in previous section",
    "we demonstrated that the dw roughness can be ignored on a time scale @xmath101 and the length scale @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the bending of the dw can be neglected if  @xmath103 .",
    "simultaneously this condition means that the process is adiabatic , i.e. that the velocity at any moment of time with high precision is equal to its stationary value corresponding to the value of the driving force @xmath104 at the same moment of time .",
    "the rectilinear ( or plane ) dw can be characterized by one coordinate only .",
    "we denote it @xmath105 . in adiabatic approximation",
    "it satisfies an obvious equation : @xmath106 where the scaling function @xmath107 behaves asymptotically as @xmath108 at small @xmath109 and as @xmath109 at large @xmath109 . instead of integrating it over time , we integrate it over field by the following change of coordinate : @xmath110 thus ,",
    "we find a following expression for @xmath18 as function of the field @xmath5 : @xmath111 this equation is correct for @xmath112 ; at smaller positive values of @xmath5 the dw does not move and @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the magnetization remains constant until the amplitude of the driving field reaches the value @xmath114 .",
    "this value marks the first dynamical phase transition : the appearance of the hysteresis loop . now starting from @xmath115 at @xmath116 , where @xmath26 is the half of size of a rectangular sample , and applying positive magnetic field",
    ", one can increase @xmath18 until it takes its maximum value @xmath117 this equation is valid as long as the right - hand side of equation ( [ zmax ] ) is less than @xmath26 .",
    "when it becomes larger , the maximal value of @xmath18 obviously remains equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the value @xmath118 of the amplitude @xmath119 , at which @xmath120 becomes equal to @xmath26 determines the second dynamical phase transition : the complete reversal of magnetization .",
    "the hysteresis loop becomes symmetric with respect to inversion : @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) ( see figure 2b ) . at smaller values of @xmath119 between @xmath123 and",
    "@xmath124 the reversal of the magnetization is incomplete , the hysteresis loop is symmetric with respect to reflection @xmath125 , but not to inversion of magnetization ( see figure 2a ) .    finally , when @xmath18 reaches the value @xmath26 for a quarter of period or less , i.e. at @xmath126 , in a range of fields @xmath127 the magnetization reaches the saturation ( in a little more realistic model it becomes a single - valued function of the field ) .",
    "we call these parts of the magnetization graph whiskers ( see figure 2c )",
    ". the value @xmath128 of @xmath119 , at which the whiskers first appear determines the third dynamical transition .",
    "it can be found from the obvious equation : @xmath129 , where we have used notations of equation ( [ z(h ) ] ) .",
    "note that similar equation is valid for @xmath118 : @xmath130 from these equation we find a scaling relation for the phase transitions fields : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a function inverse to @xmath133 .",
    "+ it is accepted to characterize the hysteresis loop by the coercive force @xmath134 , i.e. by a value of the driving force at which the magnetization vanishes ( @xmath135 ) : @xmath136 .",
    "earlier we have introduced the saturation field @xmath137 .",
    "equation for it is : @xmath138 .",
    "equation ( [ z(h ) ] ) implies that these two fields divided by @xmath123 obey the scaling equations depending on 2 dimensionless arguments @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the reader can find details in the original article @xcite .",
    "we should mention the asymptotic behavior at very big @xmath141 or @xmath142 : @xmath143 ; @xmath144 ; @xmath145 ; @xmath146 .",
    "the critical asymptotics near the mobility threshold @xmath147 is more complicated .",
    "the details can be found in the same article @xcite . + numerical mc simulation of the 2-dimensional ising model with random bonds and the glauber dynamics @xcite demonstrated that the dws , initially numerous , quickly merge to a few ones with linear size of the same order as the size of the sample .",
    "this stage of the magnetization reversal is the longest and determines dynamics in total .",
    "thus , our results are qualitatively correct for larger systems at the last and longest stage of the hysteresis process .",
    "the same numerical simulation has reproduced all types of the hysteresis loop predicted by theory of the single dw hysteresis .",
    "however , the quantitative details may be different .",
    "moreover , since theory of multidomain hysteresis does not yet exist , there is no reliable estimate of the time at which only few domains remain .",
    "as it was shown in subsection [ thermal ] , the principal difference of the dynamics at finite temperature is that the dw can start to move at an arbitrarily weak driving force due to thermal activation processes .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , there is no more mobility threshold for the constant driving force . at low temperature",
    "the threshold will be smeared . besides the finite temperature establishes new scales of the length @xmath148 , time @xmath149 , force @xmath84 and activation energy @xmath150 . in adiabatic regime",
    "it leads to appearance of an effective , temperature dependent threshold for the ac driving force . in this section",
    "we follow the work @xcite + if the driving force is alternating in time with frequency @xmath151 and amplitude @xmath119 , the barriers at the scale @xmath26 , for which @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the relaxation time for such a fluctuation , can not be overcome during one cycle of oscillation .",
    "thus , the global motion of the dw may be initiated only when the maximum of value @xmath154 over @xmath26 becomes of the order of one . from the condition @xmath155 we find a new , frequency and temperature dependent driving field @xmath156 , which plays the role of dynamic threshold .",
    "it obeys a following equation : @xmath157 ,   \\label{dynthresh}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 ( reminder : @xmath159 is a microscopic hopping time : we assume @xmath160 ) . at @xmath161",
    ", there is no macroscopic motion of the wall ; , though still its segments transfer between different metastable states with avalanches whose development time is less than @xmath162 and the length scale is less than @xmath163 .",
    "this process gives rise to dissipation .",
    "drift of the wall as a whole starts at @xmath164 . at @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "note that equation ( [ dynthresh ] ) determines @xmath156 as a monotonously decreasing function of temperature accepting the value @xmath123 at @xmath88 . at a fixed temperature @xmath167",
    "is a monotonously decreasing function of frequency .",
    "thus , dw subject to the ac driving force either remains in rest at @xmath168 , or moves due to thermal activation ( creep regime ) at @xmath169 , or it moves in the sliding regime at @xmath170 . at low temperatures these three regimes overlap with the critical behavior near @xmath171 .",
    "a schematic phase diagram of the dw motion in variables @xmath172 is shown on the r.h.s of figure [ fig : e_b ] . + having derived the velocity of dw motion as a function of the driving field at fixed temperature and frequency , we can follow the hysteresis curve using the adiabatic equation of motion similar to that at zero temperature ( [ adiabatic ] ) , but containing new parameters @xmath173 and @xmath156 : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a dimensionless function of dimensionless arguments which is equal zero at @xmath176 and 1 at @xmath109 or @xmath177 infinite .",
    "+ the shape of hysteresis loops at finite temperature is rather similar to their shape at zero temperature . in particular , all 3 dynamic phase transitions described in subsection [ zerot ] proceed at finite temperature as well , but the role of the threshold driving force plays the field @xmath156 . at the first transition the amplitude @xmath119 coincides with @xmath178 . at the second and",
    "the third transition amplitudes the same values are determined by equations : @xmath179 equations ( [ transt],[adiabatict ] ) display the scaling similar to that at zero temperature : the dimensionless ratios @xmath180 are defined by the same function of dimensionless variable @xmath181 .",
    "we again consider the motion caused by an ac driving force @xmath182 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) with a frequency @xmath183 , but we will not assume adiabatic condition .",
    "we start with zero temperature .",
    "the finite frequency @xmath184 of the driving force acts as an infrared cutoff for the propagation of perturbations generated by pinning centers .",
    "as it follows from ( [ eq:1 ] ) these perturbations can propagate during one cycle of the external force up to the ( renormalized ) diffusion length @xmath185 .",
    "+ if @xmath186 , ( i.e. @xmath187 ) there is no renormalization and @xmath31 has to be replaced by 2 . during one cycle of the ac - drive , perturbations generated by local pinning centers affect the configuration of the domain wall only up to a scale @xmath188 .",
    "if this scale is less than @xmath36 , the resulting curvature force @xmath189 is always larger than the pinning force and there is no pinning anymore .",
    "+ in the opposite case @xmath190 ( i.e. @xmath191 ) , the pinning forces compensate the curvature forces at length scales larger than @xmath36 . as a result of the adaption of the domain wall to the disorder , pinning forces are renormalized .",
    "this renormalization is truncated at @xmath188 .",
    "contrary to the adiabatic limit @xmath192 , there is no sharp depinning transition at @xmath193 . indeed , a necessary condition for the existence of a sharp transition in the adiabatic case was the requirement that the fluctuations of the depinning threshold in a correlated volume of linear size @xmath194 , @xmath195 , are smaller than @xmath196 , i.e. , @xmath197 @xcite . for @xmath193",

    "then the elastic forces tend to return too stretched intervals of the dw and submit it an average velocity opposite to the applied force , as is seen on the same figure .",

    "+ in the works by kleemann and coworkers @xcite the authors studied the dielectric spectra in ferroelectric single crystals @xmath210 in the vicinity of its transition temperature . they have found different behavior of the electric susceptibility @xmath211 vs. frequency . at low frequencies they observed a power - like behavior @xmath212 with @xmath3 between 0.2 - 0.7 .",
    "such a behavior the authors ascribe to the creep motion with a broad distribution of the activation energy . at higher frequencies they observed the logarithmic behavior of @xmath211 , which they treat as the reversible relaxation of the dw segments .",
