    "in the last years , the extra dimensions physics has acquired a conspicuous prominency , mainly due to the seminal models of large extra dimensions ( add model ) @xcite and the warped compactification models ( rs model ) @xcite .",
    "the rs model , for instance , brought to light again the possibility of noncompact extra dimension @xcite .",
    "these braneworld models provide solutions for important problems of the high energy physics , as the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite , the cosmological constant problem @xcite and the origin of dark matter @xcite .",
    "fields endowed with a bulk dynamics provide an explanation for the brane stability by assuming a stable source configuration , as a topological defect @xcite . in 5d ( or more generically in codimension @xmath2 ) models ,",
    "a domain wall brane is generated by a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism which also provides a width and inner dynamics to the brane @xcite .",
    "further , for bulk propagating fields reproduce the 4d physics , a massless kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode ought to have a compact support ( localized ) around the brane , what leads to a massless effective 4d action @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , unlike the gravitational and scalar fields , the vector gauge field has no localized massless mode @xcite , being required a coupling with the dilaton field @xcite . for the spin @xmath0 and @xmath1 fermions , the localization of the massless mode also require an additional coupling , usually a yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "the bulk dynamics and the additional coupling also provides the existence of kk massive resonant modes which brings important phenomenological consequences @xcite . another approach to obtain a normalizable massless mode for the gauge and fermionic fields in brane models with positive tension is accomplished by changing of the geometry structure for a weyl geometry @xcite .    in six dimensions ( or codimension 2 ) , stationary braneworld scenarios with axial symmetry are called string - like models @xcite .",
    "the string - like branes inherited this name due their resemblance with topological defects in @xmath3 , as the cosmic strings @xcite . assuming a warped geometry with regularity conditions , the gravity is localized in the string - like models whose source is a global defect @xcite , an infinitely thin brane @xcite or a local vortex @xcite .",
    "the gauge vector field is also localized without any other coupling but the minimal gravitational coupling @xcite .",
    "an important string - like scenario is the gherghetta - shaposhnikov ( gs ) model , whose bulk geometry is the warped product between a thin brane and the two dimensional disk @xcite .",
    "this vacuum solution of the einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant traps gravity and provides a smaller correction to the newtonian potential compared to the rs model @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the gs model does not satisfy the regularities conditions at the origin and the dominant energy condition , as well @xcite .",
    "giovannini _ et al _ found numerically a string - like solution wherein the source is a local abelian vortex in the einstein - maxwell - higgs model @xcite .",
    "this smooth and thick string - like brane satisfies all the energy conditions and all the regularity conditions @xcite .",
    "the components of the stress - energy tensor are concentrated around the origin for the winding number @xmath4 . for higher winding numbers ,",
    "the source is shifted from the origin @xcite . yet , only a numerical solution for this model is known .",
    "string - like models with gravitational higher derivatives @xcite were proposed and their cosmological features analyzed @xcite . braneworld models in 6d was also proposed assuming non - trivial transverse manifolds .",
    "carlos and moreno found a smooth string - like solution with a cigar - like shape @xcite whereas kehagias proposed a conical tear drop - like transverse space to solve the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "silva and almeida used a section of the resolved conifold to build a thick string - like brane that traps the gravitational @xcite , scalar and gauge fields @xcite .",
    "other transverse manifolds include general einstein spaces @xcite , apple - shape @xcite , football shape @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "an analytical interior and exterior string - like model was proposed wherein the transverse manifold has a cigar - like shape , the so - called string - cigar model @xcite .",
    "the bulk geometry is a warped product between a @xmath5-brane and the so - called cigar soliton , a stationary solution of the ricci which asymptotically converges to the 2d disk @xcite .",
    "the ricci flow appears in string theory as a rg flow of the worldsheet @xcite and this geometrical flux has also applications topological massive gravity @xcite and condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the cigar shape provides a metric similar to that found numerically by giovannini _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which makes the metric satisfy all the regularity conditions at the origin and behave similar to the gs model at large distances @xcite .",
    "then , the string - cigar model can be regarded as a smooth extension of the gs model @xcite . since",
    "a ricci soliton is an extension of the einstein spaces , the string - cigar model generalizes the 6d model in ref .",
    "the ricci flow in the transverse space makes the source undergo a flux that varies the brane - tensions and the bulk cosmological constant @xcite . as a result",
    ", the source satisfies all the energy conditions and it has a bell - shaped core displaced from the origin , as in the ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the spin @xmath2 and spin @xmath6 bulk fields have been already studied in the string - cigar brackground @xcite .",
    "the massless modes are localized at the brane core and they recover the usual string - like behavior at large distances @xcite .",
    "the kaluza - klein spectra are attained , showing an increasing behavior for both fields , and the correspondent massive modes are enhanced near the brane core @xcite . besides , resonant massive states are present in the gravitational case @xcite .",
    "a relevant question to address is how to include the matter fields ( fermions ) in the thin and thick string - like models . besides the spin @xmath0 spinor which describes the ordinary matter , another important fermion is the spin @xmath1 gravitino field ( superpartner of the graviton ) that arises in supergravity context and is a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "oda studied the localization of various spin fields in a thin string - like scenario @xcite .",
    "as the vector gauge field in 5d , the free spin @xmath0 and @xmath1 fermions can only be localized ( without additional interactions ) on a string - like defect with the exponentially increasing warp factor ( negative tension ) @xcite .",
    "xiao liu _ et al _ proposed to couple the fermions with a @xmath7 background gauge field by which the zero mode is confined in the thin string - like brane with positive tension @xcite .",
    "et al _ analyzed the massless and massive spectrum in a 6d supergravity model which enables a finite mass gap even for an infinite extra dimension @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite obtained a normalized massless mode for a fermion in a string - like brane with a transverse resolved conifold @xcite .",
    "the depth of the potential well and the high of the potential barrier evolves with the resolution parameter @xcite . however , although normalizable , the massless mode is not well - defined at the origin .    in this work",
    ", we propose a new coupling for the fermions with a background gauge field which localizes the zero mode in the string - cigar model .",
    "the thin - string limit is considered , as well .",
    "imposing suitable boundary conditions to guarantee the self - adjointness of the spinor operators , a normalized and everywhere well - defined massless mode is obtained for both the thin string and string - cigar models . as for the gravitational @xcite and the @xmath7 @xcite vector fields , we find that the spin @xmath0 field massless mode is shifted from the origin and sets around the displaced brane core .",
    "the mass spectrum is the same for both right - handed and left - handed chiralities and it is free of tachyons .",
    "further , the kk spectrum has an increasing pattern which exhibits the usual linear behaviour of the kaluza - klein theories . for the rarita - schwinger field ( spin @xmath1 ) , the zero mode and massive spectrum have minor changes when compared to those of the spin @xmath0 .",
    "however , the amplitudes of the massive eigenfunctions for the spin @xmath1 are higher than those for the spin @xmath0 . in comparison with the thin string - like model",
    ", the core of the string - cigar brane enhances the massive modes near the origin for both spin @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields . besides , in a schrdinger approach , the spin @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields possess identical behaviour .",
    "furthermore , the coupling also enables the presence of resonant modes ( massive modes solutions having very large amplitude near the brane ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_stringcigarbraneword ] , we review the features of the thin string and the string - cigar models .",
    "we comment on the main properties of the gravity and gauge fields in these models , which were developed in references @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we also studied the dynamics of the scalar field in these scenarios and show that is it identical to the gravitational case @xcite . in sections [ sec_fermion-1/2 ] and [ sec_fermion-3/2 ] , we study the localization of spin @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields .",
    "furthermore , the massive spectrum is obtained in both cases . concerning the resonant modes , we conclude that the schrdinger - like potentials are the same for both spin @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 cases .",
    "thus the behaviour of the resonant modes are only studied in subsection [ sec_ress ] . in section [ conclusions ] ,",
    "conclusions and perspectives are outlined .",
