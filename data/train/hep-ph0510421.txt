    "in most of extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , new massive and neutral gauge bosons , called @xmath7 , are predicted .",
    "the phenomenological features that arise about such boson have been subject of extensive studies in the literature @xcite , whose presence is sensitive to experimental observations at low and high energies , and will be of great interest in the next generation of colliders ( lhc , ilc ) @xcite . in particular , it is possible to study some phenomenological features associated with this extra neutral gauge boson through models with gauge symmetry @xmath8 also called 331 models .",
    "these models arise as an interesting alternative to explain the origin of generations @xcite , where the three families are required in order to cancel chiral anomalies completely @xcite .",
    "an additional motivation to study these kinds of models comes from the fact that they can also predict the charge quantization for a three family model even when neutrino masses are added @xcite .",
    "although cancellation of anomalies leads to some required conditions fourteen , such criterion alone still permits an infinite number of 331 models . in these models , the electric charge is defined in general as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group    @xmath9    where the value of the @xmath10 parameter determines the fermion assignment and , more specifically , the electric charges of the exotic spectrum .",
    "hence , it is customary to use this quantum number to classify the different 331 models .",
    "if we want to avoid exotic charges we are led to only two different models i.e. @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "an extensive and detailed study of models with @xmath10 arbitrary has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the scalar sector and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the fermionic and gauge sector .",
    "the group structure of these models leads , along with the sm - neutral boson @xmath12 to the prediction of an additional current associated with a new neutral boson @xmath13 it is possible to study the low energy deviations of the @xmath14pole observables through a precision fit of the @xmath15 mixing @xcite , which may provides indirect constraints on the free parameters of the model ( including @xmath10 ) .",
    "unlike the @xmath16-boson whose couplings are family independent and the weak interactions at low energy are of universal character , the couplings of @xmath7 are different for the three families due to the @xmath17 values to each of them . in the quark sector",
    "each of the 331 families in the weak basis can be assigned in three different ways into mass eigenstates . in this way , in a phenomenological analysis , the allowed region associated with the @xmath15 mixing angle and the physical mass @xmath18 of the extra neutral boson will depend on the family assignment .",

    "in addition , the study of rare decays provides a framework to evaluate any new physics beyond the sm ( for a recent review on the rare z decays , see ref .",

    ", the sm may induce fcnc in the @xmath16 decay by introducing either one loop corrections or effective couplings with dimension 6 @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the flavor changing processes in the z gauge sector are forbidden at tree level even though we considered rotations of the fermions from weak to mass eigenstates . in the context of models beyond the sm with extra neutral currents ,",
    "the @xmath15 mixing produces small deviations that break the universality feature , and induces fcnc at tree level in @xmath16 decays chiang , sher , perez2 when rotations between weak and mass eigenstates are implemented .",
    "such flavor changing couplings are model dependent langaker1 , and its realization could be verified in the future @xmath21 lineal colliders at the tev scale ( tesla @xcite ) . in the case of 331 models ,",
    "fcnc at tree level due to the @xmath15 mixing arise only in the quark sector , while the couplings of the leptons with @xmath16 and @xmath22 are universal of families ( ref .",
    "@xcite considers new 331 models with fcnc in the lepton sector ) .",
    "we take specific textures for the quark mass matrices in agreement with the current data on the ckm mixing angles .",
    "the assignments for texture on mass fermions have been broadly discussed in the literature @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report a phenomenological study of the 331-extra neutral boson .",
    "first , we consider indirect limits at the @xmath16 resonance for models with @xmath10 arbitrary , including linear combinations among the quark families .",
    "we adopt the texture structure proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to obtain allowed regions for the @xmath15 mixing angle , the mass of the @xmath7 boson and the values of @xmath10 for three different assignments of the quark families @xcite in mass eigenstates .",
    "the above analysis is performed through a @xmath23 statistics at 95% cl including correlation data among the observables .",
    "later , we study high energy corrections of the @xmath7 decay in the framework of models with @xmath24 . these analysis",
    "are performed considering oblique corrections at one loop level , where running coupling constants at @xmath18 scale are taken into account .",
    "we also calculate the fcnc contributions in the @xmath16 and @xmath7 decays .",
