    "after almost three decades of intensive studies , cuprates continue to attract significant interest because of their outstanding properties and due to the continued research effort in high - temperature superconductivity.@xcite in particular , their magnetic properties remain inspirational , both as potentially responsible for the mechanism of superconductivity@xcite and on their own right as relevant to a larger class of low - dimensional antiferromagnets and as a test case for various theoretical models .",
    "@xcite however , understanding of some of the properties of the magnetic excitations in layered cuprates remains incomplete .",
    "this concerns interactions of such excitations with themselves and various other perturbations , as well as the role of such interactions in observable spectroscopic and transport phenomena .",
    "earlier studies of thermal conductivity in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite have demonstrated large contribution of magnetic excitations to the in - plane thermal transport , thus offering a unique window into their properties which are not easily accessible by other methods .",
    "more recent experimental advances @xcite call for a deeper theoretical insight into the mechanisms of magnon heat current dissipation .",
    "this interest goes beyond a particular material and highlights a broader importance of general understanding of the transport phenomena in a wider class of antiferromagnets .",
    "while scattering of magnons among themselves and due to fluctuations of the order - parameter in the paramagnetic state has received significant attention in the past,@xcite the impact of phonons on magnon lifetime and other properties of magnetic excitations has only recently begun receiving attention.@xcite    in this context , the current work focuses on the physics of magnon scattering and its role in magnetic thermal transport of quantum antiferromagnets . while our approaches are generic , our analysis is strongly motivated by la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and related cuprates .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the case of 2d magnons and superexchange coupling @xmath2 large compared to the debye energy @xmath6 , for temperatures @xmath7 , where the validity of a magnon description is well - established @xcite . moreover , most of our work is devoted to the magnon - phonon scattering to clarify the role of this less - studied relaxation mechanism .",
    "additional effects , such as grain boundary and impurity scattering , and the role of finite correlation length are discussed less extensively .",
    "in addition to investigation of the transport properties of layered cuprates , we also contribute to the formal development of transport theory by contrasting the results from two complementary methods , the boltzmann theory and the memory function technique . for the relaxation - time approximation within the boltzmann approach , we take advantage of the large energy scale of magnetic excitations and thus operate with asymptotic , long - wavelength expressions augmented by appropriate cut - offs and some well - justified modeling of the optical phonon spectra . for the magnon - phonon scattering we advocate the use of a simplified `` effective phonon dos '' approach , which allows for straightforward yet fairly realistic calculations . in the memory - function approach , on the other hand , we maintain microscopic expressions for the magnon spectra valid in the entire brillouin zone , while using coupling to a single dispersive phonon branch with a model dispersion , which introduces scattering on both acoustic and optical - like zone - boundary modes .",
    "the final results from both approaches , i.e. the thermal conductivities vs. temperature , are found to be remarkably similar .",
    "moreover , a complete agreement between both approaches on the power - law asymptotic regimes , controlled by the optical and acoustic phonons , is also demonstrated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin with a general discussion of the qualitative features of the magnon - phonon scattering in sec .",
    "[ qualitative ] followed by intuitively clear details of boltzmann approach and calculations of @xmath4 within it in sec .",
    "[ boltzmann ] .",
    "we continue with the exposition of the memory - function approach and its results for the effective relaxation rates and thermal conductivity in sec .",
    "[ mf ] . a brief discussion of other scattering mechanisms and of their respective roles is given in the corresponding sections devoted to the thermal conductivity calculations .",
    "technical details , discussion of the physical range of spin - phonon coupling , etc . , are delegated to several appendices .",
    "generally speaking , a spin system on a lattice can always be described by a hamiltonian consisting of spin - only and lattice - only parts , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , in addition to a coupling between them , which we will assume to be of magnetoelastic nature @xmath10 @xmath11 having in mind la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and related cuprates , we take a simple , nearest - neighbor - dominated heisenberg model with the superexchange constant @xmath2 on a square lattice to be a faithful description of the 2d antiferromagnet of interest .",
    "appendix [ app0 ] offers the standard linear spin - wave treatment of it leading to the free - magnon hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnon energy and @xmath14 from now on .",
    "the full phonon spectrum of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is representative of that of the other cuprates and comprises three acoustic and eighteen optical modes . with a typical bandwidth of each branch from 50k to 400k , together they span the range of energies reaching 900k .",
    "@xcite while in what follows we will model them in a simplified fashion , one can write their hamiltonian as @xmath15 where @xmath16 numerates branches of phonon excitations .    a straightforward derivation yields the lowest - order magnon - phonon coupling in the following general form ( see appendix  [ appa ] for details ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the `` normal '' and `` anomalous '' spin - phonon coupling vertices . for the coupling to acoustic and optical ( or zone - boundary )",
    "phonons , they assume different asymptotic forms , discussed in the next section and in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "since we are interested in the thermal transport by magnons , the following generic consideration is useful .",
    "because the phonon debye energy ( @xmath20k ) is much smaller than the magnon bandwidth ( @xmath21k ) , phonons can be assumed to be in thermal equilibrium , i.e. , playing the role of a `` bath '' .",
    "this is well - justified for temperatures comparable to or above half of the phonon debye energy @xmath22 , which is about 200k in most cuprates .",
    "then neither the momentum nor the energy of a magnon is conserved in the processes of magnon - phonon scattering , or , in other words , the momentum and energy are transferred from the magnon flow to the phonon bath . in that case , magnon relaxation time and transport times can be treated as the same .    thus , in contrast to the inter - magnon scattering , the magnon - phonon scattering channel is free from many restrictions of the former and does not have the limitations on the phase space inherent to an umklapp scenario . while the spin - lattice coupling constant may be small , phonons at temperatures @xmath23k are abundant in the materials of interest .",
    "another qualitative consideration , elaborated on in sec .",
    "[ boltzmann ] , is that magnetic excitations are confined to lower dimensions than phonons ( i.e. , 2d vs 3d ) . in this case ,",
    "momentum of phonons perpendicular to the 2d planes is not conserved , which also leads to fewer restrictions on the kinematics of the magnon - phonon scattering .",
    "-0.3 cm    within the boltzmann approach , the key element is the calculation of the scattering rates . as is argued above , transport and quasiparticle relaxation rates of magnons due to scattering on phonons should be the same .",
    "then , in the lowest order of spin - phonon coupling , the problem is reduced to evaluation of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] , which yield magnon relaxation rate by the standard diagrammatic method @xmath24 with the first term corresponding to the diagram in fig .",

    "[ diagrams](b ) , in which phonon is absorbed .",
    "the third term is due to anomalous process , fig .",
    "[ diagrams](c ) , in which two magnons are absorbed and the phonon is emitted .",
    "we drop summation over the phonon branch index @xmath16 here , thus considering one branch of phonons at a time .",
    "the magnon - phonon vertices in ( [ 1tau ] ) are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ hsph2_0 ] ) and for the first two terms they are related by a permutation of the initial and final states of the magnon .",
    "note that the 2d momentum conservation in eq .",
    "( [ 1tau ] ) , explicated by the @xmath25 s , concerns only the in - plane momentum of the phonon @xmath26 , while the component perpendicular to the plane , @xmath27 , is not conserved .",
    "this is natural as magnons have infinite mass in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "this feature is important for the future consideration and we separate sums over the components of phonon momenta @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ 1tau ] ) explicitly .",
    "there are two approximations for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and related cuprates that follow from the fact that all relevant energies , @xmath29 and @xmath6 , are much smaller than the magnon bandwidth , @xmath30 : ( i ) magnon energies can be linearized @xmath31 because for all practical purposes @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 , ( ii ) similarly , magnon - phonon vertices for the optical and acoustic phonons are ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the magnon velocity ( @xmath37 , lattice constant @xmath38 ) , and both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 ( see sec .  [ sec_ph_sum ] and appendices  [ appa ] and [ appd ] for details).@xcite for the acoustic case , the phonon dispersion in the vertex is also linearized , in line with the debye approximation .",
    "while magnon - phonon vertices in ( [ vopt ] ) and ( [ vac ] ) can be proposed on general grounds , they can also be derived from realistic microscopic models of spin - phonon coupling , an exercise deferred to appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "the same appendix also deals with the role of polarization of the 3d phonons in the coupling to spins .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath42 form of these microscopic vertices agrees with ( [ vopt ] ) and ( [ vac ] ) , aside from some additional angular dependence that does not affect the results .",
    "the typical magnitude of coupling constants @xmath43 s will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_ph_sum ] .",
    "we also make a note that coupling to the optical mode should typically involve a large in - plane momentum transfer @xmath26 , in which case a zone - boundary phonon from the nominally acoustic phonon branch is equivalent to the optical phonon .",
    "such processes result in the scattering of a magnon from , e.g. , the branch near @xmath44 to another branch near the af ordering vector @xmath45 [ @xmath46 .",

    "magnon and acoustic phonon energies are linearized .",
    "schematics of the magnon [ momentum @xmath49 absorbing a phonon [ in - plane momentum @xmath26 ] is also shown . ]",
    "-0.5 cm    the next line of approximations requires some qualitative kinematic consideration .",
    "the linearization of magnon energies in ( [ ek])-([vac ] ) is well - justified for a typical @xmath51 and already allows for some simplification in ( [ 1tau ] ) .",
    "naturally , the `` typical '' range of momenta of magnons involved in the heat transport at relevant temperatures is limited by @xmath52 , which is @xmath53 and concerns a small fraction of the brillouin zone .",
    "then , the typical _ in - plane component _ of the phonon momenta @xmath54 for the phonons involved in the magnon scatterings in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] must also be limited to the same range , @xmath55 , see the sketch in fig",
    ".  [ sketch ] .",
    "note , that _ if _ ( acoustic ) phonons would also be confined to 2d , this would imply that their typical energy needs to be much less than the energy of magnons : @xmath56",
    ".    however , for the 3d phonons the situation is radically different .",
    "the energy conservations in eq .",
    "( [ 1tau ] ) imply @xmath57 , so for the typical magnon energy @xmath29 , the typical energy of a phonon is also @xmath29 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the out - of - plane component of the phonon momentum is much larger than the in - plane one , @xmath58 .",
    "this is particularly easy to see for the acoustic phonon , for which the combination of the ( in - plane ) momentum and energy conservations yields@xcite @xmath59 so for @xmath60 it follows that @xmath61 . for the optical phonon , @xmath62 ,",
    "the argument is simply that the typical @xmath63 while @xmath64 does not have such restrictions .",
    "note that for the optical phonon @xmath65 is shifted by the in - plane af - ordering vector .",
    "altogether , this begs for the following approximation @xmath66 simply neglecting the dependence of the phonon energy on the ( small ) in - plane momentum transfer @xmath67 .",
    "this approximation immediately simplifies eq .",
    "( [ 1tau ] ) as the integral over @xmath26 simply removes the in - plane momentum delta - functions , while the rest of the expression is independent of it ( see a slightly more involved treatment of the case of the acoustic phonon later ) .",
    "then the integration over @xmath68 in ( [ 1tau ] ) is simply removed by the energy conservation using linearized magnon energies .",
    "lastly , the remaining integration over @xmath64 can be rewritten by introducing an effective dos for phonons .",
    "thus , one of the main results of this work is the development of an `` effective '' approach in which @xmath69- and @xmath29-dependencies of the relaxation rates in eq .",
    "( [ 1tau ] ) are given by simple 1d integrals .",
    "a very close precision of this approach is demonstrated in appendix [ appb ] by a comparison with the direct integration in eq .",

    "the following scenario has been put forward .",
    "since the ionic motion in the cuprates is much slower than the superexchange processes among spins , the former must cause a significant variation of couplings @xmath2 due to zero - point and thermal lattice fluctuations .",

    "last but not the least is the effect of magnon - magnon scattering .",
    "since these require an explicit momentum dissipation to contribute to conductivities , the standard umklapp process leading to a scattering of a typical low - energy magnon with the momentum @xmath145 must involve a high - energy magnon with the energy @xmath177 .",
    "then , one can suggest an ansatz @xmath178 this can be seen as an upper limit estimate for the standard umklapp scattering rate as it neglects possible smallness of the matrix element and only takes into account the smallness of @xmath145 from the initial state .",
    "there exists a possibility of an unconventional `` low - energy umklapp '' , because magnons in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 have two branches , at @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so that some of the scattering _ between _ these branches may carry away large momenta .",
    "this logic seems to be implied in a recent calculation in ref .  .",
    "in that case , the corresponding relaxation rate can be expected to display a power - law behavior , similar to the `` normal '' magnon - magnon scattering@xcite @xmath181 which , on `` thermal shell '' , differs by a factor @xmath182 from the magnon - phonon estimate in ( [ est_tau2 ] ) .",
    "this implies that for sufficiently high temperatures , @xmath183 , magnon - phonon scattering must be more important than the inter - magnon scattering .",

    "for instance , a convenient choice is @xmath205@xmath432 , which ensures that it is orthogonal to the @xmath433 plane . since in ( [ vmagph])([vmagph2 ] ) we are interested only in @xmath418 and @xmath419 projections of the polarization vectors , this choice leaves nonzero only @xmath434 component .",
    "however , the situation is even simpler because , according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ prelim ] , in a typical scattering process component of the phonon momentum perpendicular to the plane is much larger than the in - plane component , @xmath435 .",
    "this means that the in - plane projections of the longitudinal phonon polarization vector are negligible , @xmath436 . in turn , this means that the polarizations of the two transverse modes lie almost entirely in the @xmath437 plane and the corresponding vectors can simply be chosen along the @xmath418 and @xmath419 axes with @xmath438 and @xmath439 .",
    "therefore , it is the transverse phonons with the momentum largely orthogonal to the antiferromagnetic planes that couple most strongly to the spin excitations . as a result ,",
    "summation over @xmath16 in ( [ hsph2 ] ) should concern only them .",
    "we note that the same arguments have been used previously for the spin - phonon coupling in 1d spin chains , see ref .  .",
    "thus , using @xmath440 for the transverse branches , the magnon - phonon coupling with the acoustic phonons is reduced to just two non - zero terms @xmath441 where @xmath442 and the results are the same for the anomalous coupling @xmath443 .    since the vertices in ( [ vmagph3 ] ) couple to different but degenerate phonon branches , they will contribute independently to the scattering probability , so that @xmath444",
    ". then it is natural to introduce an effective coupling to just one phonon branch that would lead to the same scattering rate @xmath445 in which we simply ignored the angular dependence in the brackets in ( [ vmagph3 ] ) [ second terms ] .",
    "this is equivalent only to a quantitative ( order of 1 ) change in the effective coupling constant .",

    "therefore , of interest are the limits @xmath448 and @xmath449 for vertices in ( [ vmagph ] ) and ( [ vmagph1 ] ) .",
    "importantly , the phonon involved in such a process has a large momentum with the in - plane component @xmath450 , which corresponds to a zone - boundary excitation with the energy of order @xmath3 and is similar to the optical modes considered next .",
    "expansion of the `` magnon part '' [ content of the curly brackets ] in ( [ vmagph ] ) and ( [ vmagph1 ] ) gives @xmath451 where we have shifted @xmath452 and also used that @xmath453 for @xmath450 .",
    "focusing now on the `` normal '' vertex and following the same choice of polarization vectors as above leads to two non - zero vertices @xmath454 with the coupling constant to the zone - boundary phonon @xmath455 . combining the two couplings to different phonon branches into one effective",
    "vertex gives @xmath456 where @xmath128 is the angle between @xmath69 and @xmath68 and anomalous vertex is the same with @xmath457 .",
    "the only difference of the effective coupling in ( [ vp_opt2 ] ) from the coupling to the optical phonon proposed in ( [ vopt ] ) is the additional angular dependence .",
    "it is easy to see that when calculating the scattering probabilities with @xmath458 the latter will be averaged to an additional factor @xmath459 and thus corresponds to a simple change of the effective coupling constant .      to introduce optical phonons into the spin - lattice coupling model one needs to depart from the bravias picture of ( [ hsph0 ] ) .",
    "for that , keeping in mind cuprates , mutual displacement of copper ions @xmath401 should now be recognized as involving the complete set of phonon normal modes .",
    "that is , the summation over @xmath16 in ( [ uq ] ) should now be treated as involving not only three acoustic branches of the bravias lattice , but the entire group of optical modes as well . in that sense ,",
    "the general form of the spin - coupling hamiltonian in ( [ hsph1 ] ) and the entire consideration of it remains valid with the magnon - phonon coupling constants and optical phonon energies used accordingly .",
    "it is then clear that the small-@xmath26 scatterings involving optical branches should be less important than the ones involving acoustic modes , while the large-@xmath26 do not carry additional smallness of @xmath460 and should be important . therefore , a consideration of the leading effect of the optical - phonon coupling is very similar to that of the zone - boundary phonon above .",
    "thus , without going into consideration of the details of the crystal structure of specific materials and neglecting nonessential angular dependence similarly to the cases considered above yields @xmath461 with @xmath462 where @xmath74 is the energy of the optical branch .",
    "thus , the form of the magnon - phonon interaction proposed in ( [ vopt ] ) is verified .",
    "while , obviously , the coupling strength must depend on the type of the optical model involved , one can suggest@xcite the so - called `` stretching mode '' at high energies as a strong candidate for a significant spin - phonon coupling .",
