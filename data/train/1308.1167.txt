    "[ fig : partialmodulation ] ( d ) with @xmath185 , only the left side of the system without the lattice modulation becomes a topological superconductor , and the eigenvector is this time localized to the two ends of the left part , with the value of @xmath116 similar to that in ( b ) . on the other hand , in fig .",

    "this is because the part with the lattice modulation can not form a well - defined topological superconductor if it is too short .    in summary ,",
    "when two ts regions are joined , the resulting system become a ts with end majorana states at the ends . on the other hand , if a ts is joined with a topologically trivial chain , the resulting system becomes a ts whose majorana states appear close to where they had been in the original ts .",
    "this does not depend on which of the chains has spatial modulation .",

    ", width=327 ]    the correspondence between the ` diagonal ' modulation in the lattice site energy and the ` off - diagonal ' one in the hopping amplitude in quasiperiodic systems has attracted a renewed attention .",
    "@xcite here we study the effect of such a modulation in the hopping amplitude in our system , in which case the hamiltonian is given by @xmath192 with @xmath193\\ ] ] and @xmath194 .",

    "fig : hopmod05 ] we plot the single particle state energy as well as the value of @xmath104 obtained by solving the bdg equation similar to ( [ eqn : bdg ] ) but the diagonal ( spin - preserving ) blocks of the kinetic term substituted by the one with the modulated hopping parameter .",
    "we observe that , while the details of the single particle spectrum is changed , the correspondence between the effectively single - band region in the spectrum and the zeros of the @xmath104 is also observed here .",
    "the symmetry of the hamiltonian is not changed by going from the site level modulation to the hopping parameter modulation .",
    "therefore similar response to phase jumps or partial modulations inside the system is expected for the latter case as in the former case , which has been studied in the above .",
    "in summary , we have studied the effect of different types of spatial modulations on the realization of a topological superconductor in a 1d conductor with proximity - induced superfluidity and spin - orbit coupling , extending our previous work , ref .  .",
    "the combination of a quasiperiodic site energy modulation with the external zeeman field and the spin - orbit coupling results in the single particle state energy distribution having a fractal pattern , _ double hofstadter butterfly_. within the mean - field , bogoliubov - de gennes approximation , our model hamiltonian can be diagonalized .",
    "we have demonstrated that the smallest positive eigenvalue of the hamiltonian is strongly governed by the single particle energy spectrum for relatively weak induced superfluidity .",
    "localized end modes , which are majorana fermions , exist when two eigenvalues are degenerate at zero energy .",
    "as we change the chemical potential or the modulation wavenumber , we observe multiple reentrant transitions into and out of topologically nontrivial states .",
    "however , for stronger superfluidity , small patterns of the double hofstadter butterfly are smeared from the eigenvalue plot showing the topologically nontrivial parameter ranges .",
    "the resulting topological superconductor is sensitive to the direction of the magnetic field , while the phase of the modulation does not affect the system .",
    "we have also studied the effects of the phase jump of the quasiperiodic potential and what happens when the potential is applied to only a part of the quantum wire .",
    "the results reflect that the system is characterized by a @xmath0 quantum number , that is , all the topologically nontrivial states are indistinguishable , and if two regions with such states are joined , the majorana end modes appear only at the ends of the resulting system . if the chemical potential can be changed , the locations of the end modes can be manipulated .",
    "a quasiperiodic hopping modulation also exhibits a similar phase diagram with reentrant topological transitions .",
    "recently a scheme for topological superconductivity without proximity effect has been proposed @xcite .",
