    "fermion electric dipole moments ( edms ) are known to be extremely useful constraints on ( the cp violating part of ) models depicting interesting scenarios of beyond standard model ( sm ) physics . in particular , the experimental bounds on neutron edm ( @xmath0 ) and electron edm ( @xmath1 )",
    "are very stringent .",
    "the current numbers are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the sm contributions are known to be very small , given that the only source of cp violation has to come from the km phase in ( charged current ) quark flavor mixings : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "extensions of the sm normally are expected to have potentially large edm contributions .",
    "for instance , for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there are a few source of such new contributions .",
    "for example , they can come in through @xmath6 sfermion mixings .",
    "the latter have two parts , an @xmath7-term contribution as well as a @xmath8-term contribution .",
    "the @xmath8-term is a result of the complex phase in the so - called @xmath9-term .",
    "the resulted constraints on mssm have been studied extensively .",
    "we are interested here in the modified version with r parity not imposed .",
    "we will illustrate that there are extra contributions at the same level and discuss the class of important constraints hence resulted .",
    "a theory built with the minimal superfield spectrum incorporating the sm particles , the admissible renormalizable interactions dictated by the sm ( gauge ) symmetries together with the idea that supersymmetry ( susy ) is softly broken is what should be called the the generic supersymmetric standard model ( gssm ) .",
    "the popular mssm differs from the generic version in having a discrete symmetry , called r parity , imposed by hand to enforce baryon and lepton number conservation . with the strong experimental hints at the existence of lepton number violating neutrino masses",
    ", such a theory of susy without r - parity deserves ever more attention .",
    "the gssm contains all kinds of ( so - called ) r - parity violating ( rpv ) parameters .",
    "the latter includes the more popular trilinear ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) and bilinear ( @xmath13 ) couplings in the superpotential , as well as soft susy breaking parameters of the trilinear , bilinear , and soft mass ( mixing ) types . in order not to miss any plausible rpv phenomenological features , it is important that all of the rpv parameters be taken into consideration without _ a priori _ bias .",
    "we do , however , expect some sort of symmetry principle to guard against the very dangerous proton decay problem .",
    "the emphasis is hence put on the lepton number violating phenomenology .",
    "the renormalizable superpotential for the gssm can be written as w & = & _ ab+ _ ijk^ _ i^c _ j^c _ k^c , where @xmath14 are @xmath15 indices , @xmath16 are the usual family ( flavor ) indices , and @xmath17 are extended flavor indices going from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . at the limit where @xmath20 and @xmath21 all vanish ,",
    "one recovers the expression for the r - parity preserving mssm , with @xmath22 identified as @xmath23 . without r - parity imposed ,",
    "the latter is not _ a priori _ distinguishable from the @xmath24 s .",
    "note that @xmath25 is antisymmetric in the first two indices , as required by the @xmath15 product rules , as shown explicitly here with @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , @xmath27 is antisymmetric in the last two indices , from @xmath28 .",
    "r - parity is exactly an _",
    "ad hoc _ symmetry put in to make @xmath22 , stand out from the other @xmath29 s as the candidate for @xmath23 .",
    "it is defined in terms of baryon number , lepton number , and spin as , explicitly , @xmath30 .",
    "the consequence is that the accidental symmetries of baryon number and lepton number in the sm are preserved , at the expense of making particles and superparticles having a categorically different quantum number , r parity .",
    "the latter is actually not the most effective discrete symmetry to control superparticle mediated proton decay@xcite , but is most restrictive in terms of what is admitted in the lagrangian , or the superpotential alone . on the other hand",
    ", r parity also forbides neutrino masses in the supersymmetric sm .",
    "the strong experimental hints for the existence of ( majorana ) neutrino masses is an indication of lepton number violation , hence suggestive of r - parity violation .",
    "the soft susy breaking part of the lagrangian is more interesting , if only for the fact that many of its interesting details have been overlooked in the literature .",
    "however , we will postpone the discussion till after we address the parametrization issue .",
    "doing phenomenological studies without specifying a choice of flavor bases is ambiguous .",
    "it is like doing sm quark physics with 18 complex yukawa couplings , instead of the 10 real physical parameters .",
    "as far as the sm itself is concerned , the extra 26 real parameters are simply redundant , and attempts to relate the full 36 parameters to experimental data will be futile . in the gssm , the choice of an optimal parametrization mainly concerns the 4 @xmath31 flavors .",
    "we use here the single - vev parametrization@xcite ( svp ) , in which flavor bases are chosen such that : 1/ among the @xmath31 s , only @xmath32 , bears a vev , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 ; 2/ @xmath34 ; 3/ @xmath35 ; 4/ @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the big advantage of the svp is that it gives the complete tree - level mass matrices of all the states ( scalars and fermions ) the simplest structure@xcite .",
    "the svp gives quark mass matrices exactly in the sm form . for the masses of the color - singlet fermions",
    ", all the rpv effects are paramatrized by the @xmath13 s only .",
    "for example , the five charged fermions ( gaugino + higgsino + 3 charged leptons ) , we have [ mc ] _ c = (    ccccc m_2 & & 0 & 0 & 0 + & _ 0 & _ 1 & _ 2 & _ 3 + 0 & 0 & m_1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & m_2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & m_3    )",
    ". moreover each @xmath13 parameter here characterizes directly the rpv effect on the corresponding charged lepton ( @xmath39 , @xmath9 , and @xmath40 ) .",
    "this , and the corresponding neutrino - neutralino masses and mixings , has been exploited to implement a detailed study of the tree - level rpv phenomenology from the gauge interactions , with interesting results@xcite .",
    "neutrino masses and oscillations is no doubt one of the most important aspects of the model . here",
    ", it is particularly important that the various rpv contributions to neutrino masses , up to 1-loop level , be studied in a framework that takes no assumption on the other parameters .",
    "our formulation provides such a framework .",
    "interested readers are referred to refs.@xcite .",
    "obtaining the squark and slepton masses is straightforward , once all the admissible soft susy breaking terms are explicitly written down@xcite .",
    "the soft susy breaking part of the lagrangian can be written as v_soft & = & _ ab b _",
    "h_u^a _ ^b + _ ab + h.c .",
    "+ & + & _ ab + a^^_ijk ^c_i ^c_j ^c_k + h.c .",
    "+ & + & ^_^2 + ^ _ ^2 + ^ _ ^2 + ^_^2 + ^ _ ^2 + _ h_u^2 |h_u|^2 + & & + + + + h.c . , [ soft ] where",
    "we have separated the r - parity conserving @xmath7-terms from the rpv ones ( recall @xmath41 ) .",
    "note that @xmath42 , unlike the other soft mass terms , is given by a @xmath43 matrix .",
    "explicitly , @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath45 of the mssm case while @xmath46 s give rpv mass mixings .",
    "the only rpv contribution to the squark masses is given by a @xmath47 term in the @xmath6 mixing part .",
    "note that the term contains flavor - changing ( @xmath48 ) parts which , unlike the @xmath7-terms ones , can not be suppressed through a flavor - blind susy breaking spectrum .",
    "hence , it has very interesting implications to quark electric dipole moments ( edms ) and related processses such as @xmath49@xcite .",
    "the mass matrices are a bit more complicated in the scalar sectors@xcite .",
    "we illustrated explicitly here only the charged scalare mass matrix .",

    "@xmath55 is just the @xmath56 r - parity conserving leptonic @xmath7-term .",
    "there is no contribution from the admissible rpv @xmath7-terms under the svp .",
    "also , we have used @xmath57 .",
    "let us take a look first at the quark dipole operator through 1-loop diagrams with @xmath6 squark mixing .",
    "a simple direct example is given by the gluino diagram .",
    "comparing with the mssm case , the extra ( rpv ) to the @xmath58 squark @xmath6 mixing in gssm obvious modified the story .",
    "if one naively imposes the constraint for this rpv contribution itself not to exceed the experimental bound on neutron edm , one gets roughly @xmath59 , a constraint that is interesting even in comparison to the bounds on the corresponding parameters obtainable from asking no neutrino masses to exceed the super - kamiokande atmospheric oscillation scale@xcite .",
    "in fact , there are important contributions beyond the gluino diagram and without @xmath6 squark mixings involved . for the mssm , it is well - known that there is such a contribution from the chargino diagram , which is likely to be more important than the gluino one when a unification type gaugino mass relationship is imposed .",
    "the question then is if the gssm has a similar rpv analog . a rpv version of the chargino diagram is given in fig.1 .",
    "the diagram , however , looks ambiguous .",
    "looking at the diagram in terms of the electroweak states involved under our formulation , it seems like a @xmath60@xmath61 mass insertion is required , which is however vanishing .",
    "however , putting in extra mass insertion , with a @xmath13 flipping the @xmath60 into a @xmath62 first seems to give a non - zero result .",
    "the structure obviously indicates a gim - like cancellation at worked , and we have to check its violation due to the lack of mass degeneracy .",
    "we have performed an extensive analytical and numerical study , including the complete charginolike contributions , as well as the neutralinolike contributions , to the neutron edm@xcite .",
    "the charginolike part is given by the following formula : [ edmco ] ( d_f e ) _",

    ", we have to look at the pieces in @xmath71 with a @xmath72 and a @xmath73 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath74 and @xmath75 mass eigenstates , namely the chargino states , do give the dominating contribution . with the small @xmath13 mixings strongly favored by the sub - ev neutrino masses",
    ", we have _ ( k+2)1 = r_r_21 _ ( k+2)2 = r_r_22 where the @xmath76 denotes the right - handed rotation that would diagonalize the first @xmath77 block of @xmath78 .",
    "the latter rotation matrix is expected to have elements of order 1 .",
    "hence , we have the dominating result proportional to @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the mass eigenvalue dependent part .",
    "the result agrees with what we say above .",
    "it vanishes for @xmath81 , showing a gim - like mechanism .",
    "however , with unequal chargino masses , our numerical results indicate that the cancellation is generically badly violated .",
    "more interestingly , it can be seen from the above analysis that a complex phase in @xmath82 is actually no necessary for this potentially dominating chargino contribution to be there , so long as complex cp violating phases exist in the @xmath76 matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ in the r - parity conserving parameters such as @xmath83 .",
    "an illustration of the result is given in fig .  3 in which variations of the edm contribution against the @xmath84 value is plotted . on the whole ,",
    "the magnitude of the parameter combination @xmath85 is shown to be responsible for the rpv 1-loop contribution to neutron edm and is hence well constrained .",
    "this applies not only to the complex phase , or imaginary part of , the combination .",
    "readers are referred to ref.@xcite for more details .",
    "from which the charged lepton edm formula could be extracted without too much effort .",
    "interested readers may check the reference for details .",
    "another topic we want to discuss briefly here is the dipole moments of the neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos as majorana fermions have vanishing dipole moments .",
    "however , flavor off - diagonal dipole moments , or known as transition dipole moments are interesting .",
    "there are good terrestial as well as astrophysical and cosmological bounds available@xcite .",
    "the same set of diagrams giving rise to 1-loop neutrino masses within the model give rise also to dipole moments when an extra photon line is attached .",
    "there are two types of such neutrino mass diagrams , the charged and neutral loop ones .",
    "a neutral loop diagram has , of course , no place to attach a photon line .",
    "hence , only the charged loop diagrams contribute .",
    "checking parameter fits to both neutrino masses and their implications on dipole moments would be very interesting .",
    "we give in ref.@xcite , all contributions to 1-loop neutrino masses within gssm under a systematic framework .",
    "for example , each diagram composes of two ( external ) neutrino interaction vertices .",
