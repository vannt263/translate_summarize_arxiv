    "in principle , an ideal plasma - based ion source for an ion beam would provide a perfectly uniform , very thin layer of fully ionized plasma with a single ion species , at a temperature low enough to introduce negligible beam divergence . for magnetically insulated ion diodes for light - ion inertial fusion drivers , these criteria in practice would require a plasma layer less than 1 mm thick , with areal density greater than 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , uniform to within 10@xmath5 to prevent unacceptable perturbation of the plasma surface smoothness causing beam divergence , and ion temperature below 50 ev .",
    "pulsed - laser ablation of vapor from a surface is one possible means of providing a gas layer to form such a plasma , before application of the high - voltage pulse .",
    "this gas layer can be ionized either by near - surface discharge in the applied field , or in advance , by means of photoresonance laser ionization of the vapor @xcite . by this technique",
    "one could obtain space - charge - limited current from all the anode plasma surface and , consequently , to eliminate additional sources of the ion beam divergence @xcite .",
    "work at sandia national laboratories @xcite has produced anode vapor layers in this way , by dispersing laser energy over the desired anode surface area .",
    "high uniformity and purity is very difficult to achieve by this method , especially since the areal density of vapor desired is rather small , but the area is large ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , requiring the laser energy to be dispersed uniformly to an energy density not far above the threshold for ablation , a regime in which vapor production is a strong function of laser energy density and surface contaminants may dominate vapor production .    in this paper we investigate an alternative scheme in which the laser is intentionally concentrated into a series of concentric narrow rings .",
    "vapor is produced in these rings , which are closely enough spaced ( @xmath6 mm ) that the ablated clouds merge to an adequately uniform layer of 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "the concentration allows the evaporation to be done at a higher , optimum power density for a particular laser and anode material , so that the overall laser energy is minimized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , for a given total amount of vapor , the depth of ablation in the rings is larger than for uniform illumination by the ratio of total area to ring area , so surface contaminants to bulk material ratio could be much less in comparison with a case of the disperse radiation distribution at a lower power density .",
    "= 1 cm    the scheme of the concentrator is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the concentrator is based on a fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "a laser beam is introduced by an input focusing lens into the interferometer through a small hole in the first mirror .",
    "the output lens focuses the light after the interferometer to produce concentric thin rings at the target surface .",
    "most of the energy of the laser concentrates in these rings on the surface , except only the central part of the beam which is lost by reflection back through the hole .",
    "the device including the input lens , the interferometer , and the output lens we will refer to as a concentrator .",
    "the power density in the narrow rings is chosen to be high enough to evaporate surface material efficiently .",
    "the amount of material evaporated per unit laser energy peaks at a particular optimum value .",
    "if this value is chosen for the rings of illumination , a desired area - averaged vapor density is produced with minimum laser energy .",
    "we will use the following terms : @xmath7 , @xmath8 are reflection coefficients for first and second mirrors ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 are transmission coefficients ( defined as @xmath13 ) ; @xmath14 is the wavelength of laser generation , @xmath15 is the distance between mirrors .",
    "consider a ray of the laser beam focused by the input lens with intensity @xmath16 on the input of the concentrator and angle @xmath17 to the axis .",
    "the intensity of this ray behind the back mirror is @xmath18 .",
    "the intensity of the reflected part of the ray after the first reflection from the front mirror and passing through the back mirror is @xmath19 , and after @xmath20th reflection ",
    "these rays interfere at the focal plane of the output lens .",
    "the electric field amplitude of the @xmath20th is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the phase difference of subsequent rays .",
    "the number of the interfering rays n is limited by the radius r of the interferometer , and resulting the amplitude on the target is @xmath24 , or @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "consequently the distribution of the intensity at a limited @xmath27 is @xmath28 for @xmath27 large enough ( for small @xmath17 ) this expression reduces to the well known airy - function @xmath29 the intensity @xmath30 in maxima increases rapidly with @xmath7 and @xmath8 close to 1 . for this case @xmath31 , and @xmath32    for the distribution of laser radiation over the target surface `` intensities '' @xmath30 and @xmath16 in the above written formulae have to be replaced by the radiation power densities @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are functions of radius @xmath35 and azimuthal angle @xmath36 on the target ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "in contrast to a conventional fabry - perot interferometer , where the power density can not be higher then the initial power density , for the concentrator the power density in the peaks can be much higher than the incident power density .",
    "for example , if @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , _",
    "e.g. _ the concentrator multiplies the peak power density one hundred times",
    ".    there may be substantial advantages of such an energy distribution for surface gas layer production . the maximum intensity for",
    "all the rings would be equal if the initial laser beam is uniform , and the averaged power density over any area of dimension larger than the ring spacing is equal to @xmath41 , so that for @xmath42const the distribution of averaged power density from the concentrator would be constant . the multiplication factor @xmath43 ( if @xmath38 ) gives not only the power density multiplication in the rings but also the ratio of total area to the illuminated ring area .",
    "the concentrator described can be applied to thin vapor cloud production near an anode surface of ion accelerator .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of using of the concentrator in a magnetically insulated ion diode .",
    "the upper diagram shows direct illumination of the anode for simplicity , while the lower diagram shows a way to remove the concentrator from the ion beam path .",
    "= 1 cm    let us introduce the parameters that must be involved in the calculation process .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 are the inner and outer radii of the anode , @xmath46 is the distance between illuminated rings on anode surface , @xmath47 is power density needed to evaporate the anode material",
    ". the parameters of the concentrator are : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , the foci of the input and output lenses of the concentrator ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 , the angles of the input rays that are directed by the output lens to the @xmath45 and @xmath44 radii ; @xmath52 the radius of the interferometer ; @xmath15 , the distance between the mirrors of the interferometer ; @xmath53 , the distance between the output mirror and the focus of the input lens ; @xmath54 , the radius of the hole ; @xmath55 the multiplying factor ; @xmath56 , the energy density on the output mirror surface .",
    "the laser parameters are : @xmath14 , the generation wavelength ; @xmath57 , the bandwidth of laser generation ; @xmath58 , the pulse duration ; @xmath59 , the pulse energy .",
    "we now estimate the parameters needed for realizing the scheme .",
    "we choose the cobra ion diode @xcite as an example . for this diode , @xmath60 cm , @xmath61 cm .",
    "we desire @xmath62 cm , for adequate uniformity of the vapor layer on a distance @xmath63 cm from the anode surface . for evaporation by 10 ns laser pulse of an aluminium target",
    "we choose @xmath64 mw/@xmath2 @xcite , for optimum efficiency of vapor production .",
    "experiments on vapor cloud production ( see @xcite ) show that for every target there is a range near an optimal power density where it is possible to obtain low - ionized cold vapors without the laser - induced breakdown .",
    "it is significant also that near this value of power density the amount of evaporated material and the velocity of vapor boundary are only weakly dependent on power density @xcite .",
    "thus the vapor layer could be more uniform than the initial laser power density @xmath65 .",
    "we will use the value @xmath66 m for the output lens focus , which would work in the configuration of fig.2a for the present cobra diode .",
    "fig.2b shows a possible arrangement in a focusing diode geometry .",
    "the value of @xmath49 may be adjusted to avoid interference of optical elements with the ion beam .",
    "we assume a ruby laser with wavelength @xmath67 nm . for definiteness we put @xmath68 , but this figure might be varied .",
    "the value @xmath46 defines the distance between mirrors .",
    "actually , the maxima of power density ( [ ii ] ) correspond to the zeros of @xmath69 .",
    "so two nearby maxima differ by angle @xmath70 when @xmath71 @xmath72 the distance between mirrors is @xmath73 the angles @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to the @xmath45 and @xmath44 by @xmath74 . the distance between input lens focus point and output mirror surface may now be defined @xmath75 and the hole radius is @xmath76 the required radius of the interferometer can be determined as the radius at which the laser beam with the biggest angle @xmath50 is attenuated by a factor of e@xmath77 . @xmath78",
    "the number of interfered rays is @xmath79 for this interferometer radius .",
    "we estimate the bandwidth of laser generation that is allowable to provide such narrow rings .",
    "the bandwidth must not lead to widening of the ring more than the width of the half height of the power density . from ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) we get @xmath80 the last value is close to a theoretical limit and impose strong requirement on the laser spectrum .",
    "the main critical parameter of the concentrator is the energy density in the center of the output mirror surface .",
    "the mirror must be of high quality to be not destroyed by the intense laser beam .",
    "@xmath81 this value is not too high , but the local energy density can be 3 times more due to interference effect .",
    "so the mirror must withstand the energy density of 11 j/@xmath2 .",
    "mirrors of such quality are available @xcite .",
    "the total energy of laser can be calculated from the formula @xmath82 j. only 40@xmath5 of the energy is used in the evaporation , because of noncorrespondence of the solid circular laser beam and the hollow annular anode surface .",
    "it is more efficient to use an annular laser beam .",
    "a beam with such a structure can be produced by a nd laser with nonstable resonator .",
    "use of 1.06 @xmath83 m light leads to an increase of concentrator size ( see ( [ d ] ,",
    "[ l ] , [ h ] , [ r ] ) ) : @xmath84 cm , @xmath85 cm , @xmath86 cm , @xmath87 cm .",
    "but the energy density on the output mirror surface would decrease ( see ( [ p ] ) ) @xmath88 j/@xmath2 .",
    "using the 2nd harmonic of nd laser generation gives twice smaller size ( see ( [ d ] , [ l ] , [ h ] , [ r ] ) ) : @xmath89 cm , @xmath90 cm , @xmath91 cm , @xmath92 cm .",
    "however , the energy density becomes four times higher ( see ( [ p ] ) ) , and reaches a rather high value @xmath93 j/@xmath2 . to use the concentrator in such",
    "a regime would require a mirror that would not damaged by the energy density @xmath94 j/@xmath2 .",
    "this value is over the damage threshold for the best mirror coatings @xcite .",
    "but it is possible that the mirror coating can withstand this energy density because averaged energy density is less 12 j/@xmath2 , and the value above damage threshold is reached only in very thin rings of @xmath95 of thickness that would provide fast heat diffusion over the surface due to thermal conductivity .",
    "the production of a very uniform , thin vapor layer above a solid surface by laser ablation is a difficult problem .",
    "we have suggested a method of distributing laser energy in a series of narrow , high intensity rings that could be advantageous in producing vapor efficiently , and , probably , with minimum sensitivity to surface contaminants and laser intensity variation .",
    "if this concentrated vapor production can be allowed to expand and merge into a uniform layer , these advantages might be realized .",
    "we leave aside of this paper consideration of the problem of possible small - scale non - uniformity of the gas layer produced with the concentrator as well possible anode plasma instability . obviously , at first the technique suggested has to be verified experimentally , and the anode layer parameters must be measured .",
    "this work was supported , probably in part , by u.s . civilian research and development foundation , award rp1 - 239 , and russian ministry of general and professional education ."
