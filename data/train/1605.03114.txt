    "ultrashort laser pulses that are given to a single wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) sample with duration less than a phonon period in the swnt may generate lattice oscillations coherently , which is usually called as the coherent phonons  @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , these oscillations can be treated using the concept of coherent states , in which the amplitude - phase uncertainty reach its minimum value  @xcite .",
    "recently , by using sub-10-fs laser pulses , more than @xmath0 coherent phonon modes with frequency around @xmath1@xmath2 could be observed in a ( 6,5 ) enriched single - chirality swnt sample  @xcite .",
    "this finding opened up possibilities to utilize a particular coherent phonon mode of the swnt with a wide frequency range in the thz regime for nanomechanics applications , such as high - q resonators  @xcite , as well as quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "however , we have to select a single coherent phonon mode with a well - defined frequency and suppress other phonon modes that have been excited , which is not possible to achieve by using only a single pulse of laser .",
    "one possible technique to selectively excite a particular phonon mode is by using multiple pulses with a determined repetition rate in pump - probe spectroscopy . since two decades ago , several experimental studies have used femtosecond pulse sequences for optical manipulation of molecular motion  @xcite , for enhancement of optical phonons in mixed crystals  @xcite , and also for controlling lattice dynamics at metal surfaces  @xcite . in the case of swnts ,",
    "kim _ et al .",
    "_ have recently shown that , by introducing pulse shaping  @xcite , multiple pulses with the different repetition rates that are matched to some radial breathing mode ( rbm ) frequencies ( around @xmath3@xmath4 thz ) can be used to excite the rbms of specific swnts in a bundled swnt sample .",
    "the bundled swnt sample consists of several tube species having different chiralities , represented by a set of integers @xmath5 , which give the swnt circumferencial lengths and diameters  @xcite .",
    "since the rbm frequency is inversely proportional to the swnt diameter  @xcite , different rbm frequencies will be excited at the same time if we only use a single laser pulse without pulse shaping . by applying the pulse train with a frequency matching to a rbm frequency of a single chirality swnt ,",
    "it is possible to excite the rbm of the specified swnt in the bundled sample  @xcite .    to our knowledge",
    ", it has not been shown yet whether or not the pulse - train technique can be used to generally excite a specific coherent phonon mode other than the rbms in swnts , for example , the g - bands in the swnts , which have higher frequency ( @xmath6@xmath7 thz ) . moreover , it is also interesting to investigate whether or not we can selectively generate a particular coherent phonon mode for a single - chirality swnt which is mixed in the bundled sample . due to the classical nature of coherent phonon oscillations",
    "@xcite , either in an enriched single - chirality sample or mixed bundled sample , one might think that it is trivial to selectively excite a specific phonon mode just by using a pulse train repetition frequency which is matched to the phonon frequency .",
    "however , we will show in this paper that , based on both numerical and analytical methods , the frequency matching is not the only condition to obtain the selective coherent phonon generation .",
    "further considerations such as the dependence of phonon selectivity on the number of pulses and on frequency ratio of different phonon modes are also discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we overview the way to calculate the coherent phonon amplitudes and spectra .",
    "we basically follow the methods described in our previous papers  @xcite , which now takes into account several laser pulses in the pulse train .",
    "besides the numerical method , we also show a possible description for the selective phonon excitation from the analytical solution of a driven force oscillator , which is given in section  [ sec : analytic ] . in sections  [ sec : results ] , particularly in  [ sec : rbm ] and [ sec : g ] , we discuss how we can selectively excite the radial breathing mode ( rbm ) and the g - band for a given swnt by considering some adjustable external parameters such as the laser pulse width and the pulse repetition rate ( or repetition period ) .",
    "we examine some conditions in which each of the phonon modes can be either kept surviving or suppressed .",
    "in  [ sec : relax ] , we briefly discuss the results the effects of carrier relaxation on coherent phonon generation .",
    "conclusion and perspective are given in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we define a coherent phonon mode with wavevector @xmath8 ( @xmath9 point phonon ) whose amplitude @xmath10 satisfies a driven oscillator equation  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 labels the phonon mode and @xmath13 is the phonon frequency . equation  ( [ eq : drive ] ) is solved subject to the initial conditions @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the derivation and justification of equations  ( [ eq : drive ] ) and ( [ eq : force ] ) is provided , for example , in reference  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath20 labels an electronic state , while @xmath21 gives the electron wavevector .",
    "the electronic states of a swnt are calculated within the extended tight - binding ( etb ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon matrix element @xmath22 is a simplified notation for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electron - phonon matrix element in the etb model with phonon wavevector @xmath25 and with a transition from an electronic band @xmath20 to @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in equation  [ eq : drive ] , we neglect the phonon damping term which originates from the anharmonicity  @xcite .",
    "we expect that if the phonon damping is included , an additional damping term modifying the coherent phonon amplitude will appear due to the dephasing time of the coherent phonon , which could then modulate the coherent phonon amplitude . however , looking at some experimental measurements on the phonon dephasing in swnts by single pulse pump - probe spectroscopy we estimate that even the g - band , which has a high frequency , can survive up to @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the phonon damping is not a key factor contributing to the selective phonon excitation",
    ".    in ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy , a pump laser pulse should have much shorter pulse width ( @xmath6@xmath28 ) compared with a typical coherent phonon period ( @xmath29@xmath30 ) .",
    "the observed coherent phonon intensity is proportional to the power spectrum of the oscillations of optical properties  @xcite .",
    "we see in equation  [ eq : force ] that the driving force @xmath16 depends on the photoexcited electron distribution functions , which can be calculated by considering the photogeneration of electrons .",
    "the photogeneration rate from fermi s golden rule is obtained as  @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the @xmath21 dependent transition energies for a given swnt at time @xmath33 of phonon oscillation , @xmath34 is the pump laser energy , @xmath35 is the optical matrix element obtained within the dipole approximation  @xcite , and @xmath36 is the time - dependent energy density of the pump pulse . it should be noted that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are modulated by @xmath39 of equation  ( [ eq : drive ] ) through the change of the c  c bond length  @xcite .",
    "the energy density of pump pulse , @xmath36 , is related with the pump fluence @xmath40 by a relation @xmath41 , in which @xmath36 is also assumed to be a gaussian .",
    "we define a single gaussian pulse with an index @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , with @xmath45 is the speed of light , @xmath46 is the laser pulse width , and @xmath47 is the time at which the peak of the gaussian is located .",
    "we set the fluence @xmath48 and refractive index @xmath49 .",
    "for the multiple gaussian pulses constituting the pulse train , we can sum up several @xmath50 as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of pulses and @xmath47 can be expressed as @xmath53 with @xmath54 is the pulse repetition period , defined by the time interval between two neighboring gaussian pulses .",
    "the normalization constant , @xmath55 , appearing in equation  [ eq : sumpulse ] is taken into account when we assume that the pulse train is created by dividing a single laser pulse into @xmath52 . in the simplest case , @xmath56 , i.e.",
    ", the source laser pulse is equally divided into @xmath52 gaussians . however",
    ", if we consider another pulse shaping , we generally have to integrate the pulse train laser density so that it has the same laser fluence as the source laser pulse .",
    "we can also consider carrier relaxation or decay process in addition to the photogeneration process .",
    "some experimental works have reported that the photoexcited electrons and holes in swnts are nonradiatively recombined via multiphonon emission processes within @xmath57 time scale , which is one order of magnitude slower than in graphite  @xcite .",
    "we can take these effects into account by adding a phenomenological term to the photogeneration rate in equation  ( [ eq : rate ] ) as follows : @xmath58_r = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_r } [ f_n(k , t ) - f_n^0(k)],\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the phenomenological relaxation time .",
    "when it is necessary to consider the carrier relaxation effects , we can add the relaxation term of the form of equation  ( [ eq : relax ] ) to the photogeneration rate in equation  ( [ eq : rate ] ) and solve them as a whole .",

    "firstly , we start with equation  ( [ eq : drive ] ) using the following simplified notation , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the phonon frequency , and here we have omitted the index @xmath12 from equation  ( [ eq : drive ] )",
    ". we can solve equation  ( [ eq : harmonik ] ) by using green s function method which results in the following integration problem : @xmath71    determining the shape of @xmath72 is now important to explain the phenomena of coherent phonon oscillations .",
    "it has been known from earlier studies that coherent phonon oscillations may be driven by a displacive force or impulsive force , where the basic shape of the driving force is close to a step function or delta function , respectively  @xcite . in the case of swnts ,",
    "the driving force from photoexcited carriers interacting with swnt lattices has been proposed to be displacive , i.e. , the shape is close to a step function with a broadening factor determined by the laser pulse width @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "when we consider the pulse train , we thus expect that the driving force will be like a staircase , where there are some steps originating from the number of pulses @xmath73 .",
    "it is noted that solving the driven oscillator problem by combining @xmath46 and @xmath52 for the staircase function is numerically feasible .",

    "we can see that using the pulse train with @xmath123 can already reduce the rbm amplitude because the repetition period does not coincide with the integer multiple of @xmath93 .     a possible way to suppress the rbm while at the same time keeping the g - band is by using @xmath54 with the value of half - integer multiple of @xmath93 , but @xmath46 should be less than @xmath95 .",

    "the numerical results are denoted by filled diamonds , plotted every 10 pulses due to heavy computational time .",
    "the analytical results are denoted by open circles , plotted every 1 pulse and connected with dotted lines as a guide for eyes .",
    "note that for comparing two approaches , the analytical results are normalized to numerical @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",
    "the swnt chirality considered here is @xmath90 and the pulse repetition rate is @xmath123.,width=321 ]    we find that as we increase @xmath52 , the value of @xmath139 can be much larger than @xmath140 , which indicates a very clear selectivity of the g - band phonon .",
    "the reason of the fine selection is that by using larger @xmath52 with @xmath123 , there is a higher possibility to have destructive interference for the rbm . to understand this behavior more clearly",
    ", we examine the analytical solution of @xmath104 from equation  ( [ eq : amaxanalytic ] ) for the g - band ( @xmath143 ) and for the rbm ( @xmath144 ) , and then we plot the analytical @xmath145 by assuming that @xmath146 this assumption is justified as follows .",
    "we estimate that the coherent phonon amplitude @xmath74 ( or @xmath104 ) linearly influences the optical matrix element @xmath147 in equation  ( [ eq : alfa ] ) which has a power of two , while the coherent phonon intensity in equation  ( [ eq : intensity ] ) also has another power of two .",
    "therefore , the intensity can be roughly approximated proportional to @xmath148 . by inserting some parameters from the numerical results ( @xmath54 , @xmath95 , and @xmath93 ) into the analytical formula , we can plot the analytical @xmath145 for the increase of @xmath149 every 1 pulse , denoted by open circles in figure  [ fig5](c ) . to compare the two approaches",
    ", we also normalize the analytical results to the numerical @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",
    "it can be seen that the basic trend of the numerical results in figure  [ fig5](c ) agrees well with the analytical results , i.e. , increasing @xmath52 tends to improve the g - band selectivity .",
    "interestingly , the analytical results in figure  [ fig5](c ) give us more insight on the other regimes of @xmath52 , in which some sudden increase of @xmath141 may take place periodically at particular values of @xmath52 .",
    "we expect that the origin of this behavior for @xmath123 might be related with the following relation : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a magic ratio and @xmath152 is a positive integer . for example , we can check that for @xmath153 and @xmath154 , the values of @xmath155 for @xmath156 , and @xmath157 correspond to integers @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "it means that it is still even possible to use few number of pulses in the pulse train to obtain a good selection of the g - band if we can precisely determine the ratio of the g - band and the rbm periods .",
    "furthermore , we may also increase @xmath54 by using a larger integer multiple of @xmath95 to overcome the difficulty in making ultrashort repetition periods on the order of subfemtoseconds . in that case , the value of magic ratio is scaled by the integer multiplier .",
    "we expect that the g - band selection method discussed in this section might be useful if we have many different swnt chiralities in a bundled sample , in which we can suppress the rbms of different chiralities and keep the g - band . a remaining difficulty for experimentalists regarding this technique might be on generating large number of pulses in the pulse train  @xcite . for example , the previous experiment on the rbm selectivity have used gaussian pulses up to @xmath160@xmath161 pulses  @xcite .",
    "hopefully more development in pump - probe spectroscopy in the near future can allow us to realize a better pulse train system for the g - band and other phonons selective excitation .      in the above discussions",
    ", we neglected the effect of photoexcited carrier relaxation since we only focused on the rbm and g - band selectivity by considering the pulse train repetition period and number of pulses .",
    "neglecting the carrier relaxation time is safe enough for that purpose because the relaxation time @xmath162 is long enough compared with both the pulse duration and the phonon period so that it would not alter the conditions of phonon selectivity .",
    "however , the photoexcited carrier relaxation can affect the exact amplitude of coherent phonons and hence the coherent phonon intensity , especially when the number of pulses increase , the total pulse duration becomes comparable to @xmath59 .",
    "here we are particularly interested in how the coherent phonon intensity would evolve by changing the number of pulses in the pulse train when we include the carrier relaxation effects .",
    "the relaxation effects are considered through equation  ( [ eq : relax ] ) and the coherent phonon intensity is recalculated using equations  ( [ eq : alfa])([eq : intensity ] ) .",
    "carrier relaxation effect .",
    "( a ) coherent rbm phonon intensity for the ( 11,0 ) swnt calculated by changing the number of pulses . the relaxation time is set to be @xmath163 .",
    "( b ) comparison of the coherent rbm phonon intensity for the ( 11,0 ) swnt for different relaxation time : @xmath163 ( circles ) , @xmath164 ( diamonds ) , and @xmath165 ( triangles ) , which fit well with analytical lines .",
    "the pulse train repetition period in both panels ( a ) and ( b ) is @xmath103 and the pulse width is @xmath166 .",
    "all the intensity values are normalized to unity with respect to the intensity at @xmath167.,width=302 ]    in figure  [ fig6](a ) , we show an example of the effects of the carrier relaxation on the coherent phonon intensity , in which the rbm intensity decreases when we increase the number of pulses in the pulse train . in this case",
    ", we set the relaxation time @xmath168 , the pulse repetition period @xmath103 , and the pulse width @xmath99 . in figure  [ fig6](b ) , we vary the values of @xmath59 and plot the peak rbm intensity as a function of number of pulses for @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 .",
    "we also fit the numerical data with equation  ( [ eq : qtn ] ) , calculating its @xmath104 for the rbm with an assumption that @xmath171 . as the relaxation time increases ,",
    "a flatter function of peak intensity is obtained as a function of number of pulses following an exponential feature . in the limit of @xmath172 ,",
    "the peak intensity becomes constant , independent of the number of pulses , since we have assumed that the source laser power is divided into several pulses in the pulse train .",
    "we expect that such a behavior could be useful to estimate the carrier relaxation time from experiments if we suppose that @xmath59 is initially unknown , i.e. , experimentalists can try measuring the coherent phonon spectra by changing the number of pulses in the pulse train and observe the exponential decrease of the peak intensity versus number of pulses .",
    "we have obtained some conditions for the pulse - train technique to excite a specific coherent phonon mode in swnts while suppressing the other phonon modes . as the basic condition",
    ", it is necessary to use the laser pulse width shorter than a typical phonon period for such a phonon mode to be excited .",
    "then , for the rbm , the mode selection can be achieved if the pulse repetition period matches with integer multiple of the phonon period . in the case of the g - band ,",
    "the repetition period should be of half - integer multiple of the rbm phonon period or of integer multiple of the g - band period with a large number of pulses giving a certain value of magic ratio . from this simulation",
    ", we expect that the pulse - train technique can be generally used for selectively exciting a specific phonon mode in other materials , which might be useful for optomechanical applications or for developing phononic devices .",
