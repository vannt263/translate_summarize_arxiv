    "a combinatorial formula for schubert polynomials , which for our purposes can be taken as their definition , was proven independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "diagrams illustrating this formula , called rc - graphs , were introduced in @xcite and extensively studied in @xcite .",

    "sect : tree - inv ] , we describe our bijection in terms of binary trees , giving a correspondence between features of the rc - graph known as elbow joints and the internal nodes of a binary tree . from this description",
    "it will be evident that transposing an rc - graph corresponds to flipping a binary tree around its vertical axis .",

    "let @xmath8 be a permutation . an _",
    "rc - graph _ for @xmath22 is a filling of the upper - left half of an @xmath23 array with cross pieces ( @xmath24 ) and elbow joints ( @xmath25 ) such that the strand entering the left in row @xmath26 exits the top in column @xmath27 , with the additional condition that no two strands cross more than once .",
    "this second condition can alternatively be stated as there being exactly @xmath28 cross pieces .",
    "for example , the 5 rc - graphs for @xmath29 are shown in figure [ fig : rc - graphs ] .",
    "it was shown independently in @xcite and @xcite that rc - graphs are related to schubert polynomials by the formula @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the set of rc - graphs for @xmath22 , and @xmath32 are the locations of the cross pieces in @xmath33 ( indexed so that @xmath34 would be in @xmath32 if @xmath33 has a cross in the top row and the third column ) .",

    "+    first we will show that there are in fact catalan many rc - graphs for @xmath11 ; this will allow us to prove that the combinatorial maps we give from the set of rc - graphs for @xmath11 to other catalan objects are in fact bijections by only showing that they are injections or surjections .",
    "the carlitz - riordan @xmath3-catalan numbers @xmath16 are defined by the recurrence @xmath36 , with @xmath37 ; under the interpretation of catalan numbers as counting partitions @xmath38 whose young diagrams fit inside the young diagram of the staircase partition @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 [ prop : count ]    we proceed by induction on @xmath7 .",
    "the proposition is clear for @xmath42 .    given a rc - graph @xmath33 , the strand @xmath43 entering the left in row @xmath44 and exiting the top in column @xmath45 travels through only the first and second columns .",
    "there is a unique @xmath46 , @xmath47 , such that @xmath43 goes through both the square @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "fixing @xmath46 , there must be cross pieces at @xmath50 for all @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 ; this is true by definition for @xmath54 , and each strand @xmath55 for @xmath56 crosses @xmath43 in row @xmath57 and never travels to the right of column @xmath58 , so they must each go straight through the topmost @xmath59 places in column @xmath60 , which therefore must all be cross pieces .",
    "note each column of these crosses contributes @xmath61 to the weight , for a total of @xmath62 .",

    "the cross pieces in @xmath66 , however , are each shifted @xmath59 rows down , and there are @xmath81 cross pieces in @xmath66 , so @xmath66 contributes @xmath82 to the weight of @xmath33 .    therefore , for an rc - graph @xmath33 for @xmath11 , we have @xmath83    let @xmath84 denote @xmath85 .",
    "then we have @xmath86 which proves the proposition .",
    "given proposition [ prop : count ] , we would like bijections between rc - graphs for @xmath11 and other sets of objects counted by catalan numbers .",
    "one such set is the set of partitions @xmath38 whose young diagrams fit inside the young diagram for the staircase partition @xmath39 , or , equivalently , such that @xmath87 for all @xmath46 .",
    "we denote this set @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath33 be an rc - graph for @xmath11 , and let @xmath89 be the set of locations of its elbow joints .",
    "we can then associate a partition @xmath90 to @xmath33 by requiring that the parts of its conjugate @xmath91 be , as a multiset , @xmath92 ; in other words , each elbow joint in the @xmath26-th row of @xmath33 should contribute a part of @xmath93 to @xmath91",
    ".    the proof will involve generalized inverse chute moves , which are local moves first given in @xcite that , given an rc - graph for some permutation @xmath22 , allows one to generate new rc - graphs for @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath33 be any rc - graph for some permutation @xmath22 .",
    "suppose @xmath33 has an elbow joint at @xmath50 , and that the following all hold for some @xmath94 and some @xmath95 :    1 .   for each @xmath46 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 is a cross piece , and @xmath98 is an elbow joint .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath99 , @xmath100 is a cross piece , and @xmath101 is an elbow joint .",

    "4 .   for each @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath104 , @xmath105 is a cross piece .",
    "then the diagram @xmath66 obtained from @xmath33 by changing the elbow joint at @xmath50 to a cross piece and the cross piece at @xmath106 to an elbow joint is also an rc - graph for @xmath22 , since in both cases the strand entering this area from the left at @xmath106 exits @xmath50 on the right , the strand entering from the bottom at @xmath106 exits @xmath50 on top , all other strands are unchanged , and the number of cross pieces remains the same .",
    "[ prop : elem - bij ] the above described map from @xmath33 to @xmath90 gives a bijection from @xmath107 to @xmath88 .",
    "we will show that this map is surjective and then appeal to proposition [ prop : count ] .",

    "note that @xmath109 .",
    "now we construct the rc - graph @xmath33 with @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath111 denote the @xmath26-th part of @xmath112 , with the parts in decreasing order .",
    "now , for each @xmath26 starting from 1 , if @xmath113 , take the rightmost cross piece in row @xmath114 that is not under a cross piece in the top row , and let @xmath57 be the column it is in .",
    "there exists such a cross piece since , as @xmath115 , @xmath112 has at most @xmath116 parts of size greater than or equal to @xmath117 , and @xmath108 has @xmath116 cross pieces in row @xmath118 .",
    "now let @xmath119 be the leftmost column to the right of @xmath57 such that @xmath120 has an elbow joint .",
    "then moving the cross piece at @xmath121 to @xmath122 is a generalized chute move as follows .",
    "condition 2 follows from the definition of @xmath119 , and conditions 1 and 3 follow from @xmath108 having only cross pieces in rows 2 through @xmath46 , none of which have been moved .",
    "condition 4 holds because the leftmost elbow joint in row @xmath114 to the right of column @xmath57 must either be at the end of the row , or the result of an immediately preceding move from row @xmath114 , and therefore in column @xmath119 .",
    "performing these corresponding generalized chute moves for all the parts of @xmath112 in decreasing order constructs an rc - graph for @xmath11 that goes to @xmath38 under the given map .",
    "therefore the map is a surjection and hence by our earlier count of rc - graphs a bijection .",
    "our bijection has a second description in terms of the edelman - greene correspondence , a variant of the usual rsk correspondence , originally introduced in @xcite and extended to the semi - standard case used here in @xcite .",
    "this correspondence associates to each rc - graph a pair @xmath123 of column - strict young tableaux of the same shape in such a way that if two rc - graphs have the same @xmath124-tableau , they must be rc - graphs for the same permutation .",
    "the edelman - greene correspondence works as follows .",
    "first convert the rc - graph into a sequence @xmath125 of pairs of numbers to put into the tableaux as follows .",
    "reading each row of the rc - graph from left to right and starting with the top row , if the @xmath46-th cross piece is encountered at @xmath126 , let @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "then we insert the @xmath129 one by one to create the @xmath124 tableau using edelman - greene insertion ; this is identical to rsk insertion except that , when inserting the letter @xmath26 into a row with both an @xmath26 and an @xmath130 , that row remains unchanged and an @xmath130 is bumped into the next row . as in rsk insertion , after all the bumping associated with inserting a single letter @xmath129 is completed , @xmath131 is added to the @xmath132 tableau so that it has the same shape as @xmath124 .",
    "when we are finished , @xmath124 will be both row and column - strict , but @xmath132 will only be row - strict . since column - strict tableaux are customary , we transpose both tableaux .    @xmath133    @xmath134    edelman and greene showed that the @xmath124 tableau for the long word @xmath135 is always the one in figure [ fig : longwordeg ] . as a trivial corollary",
    ", the @xmath124 tableau for any rc - graph for @xmath11 must be the one in figure [ fig : ourwordeg ] . in the case of the long word",
    ", they also gave an inverse to their insertion procedure similar to _ evacuation _ , an operation on tableaux originally due to schtzenberger@xcite .",
    "take the @xmath132-tableau , and find the box on the outer boundary with the biggest label , breaking ties by preferring the southernmost such box .",
    "let @xmath136 be the label of this box , and @xmath137 the row this box is in .",
    "now remove the box and do jeu de taquin to fill the space , eventually leaving a `` hole '' in the northwest corner of the tableau . repeat to recover @xmath138 and @xmath139 and so on until the tableau is empty . to adjust this so that it works for @xmath11 rather than the long word",
    ", we simply increase each @xmath129 by 1 .",
    "the edelman - greene correspondence sends an rc - graph for @xmath11 to a @xmath132-tableau in which the label @xmath26 occurs only in rows @xmath93 and @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath132 is column - strict , the label @xmath26 can not occur in any row strictly below than row @xmath26 .",
    "now suppose the label @xmath26 occurs in row @xmath117 for some @xmath140 .",
    "then the rightmost entry in row @xmath117 must have label @xmath46 for some @xmath141",
    ". this entry will never be moved by the jeu de taquin during the evacuation procedure , so , eventually , we will have an element @xmath142 .",
    "but , since @xmath143 , the @xmath118-st anti - diagonal does not meet the @xmath46-th row , so we could not have started with an rc - graph for @xmath11 in the first place .",
    "now we can define a bijection from rc - graphs for @xmath11 to partitions fitting inside @xmath144 by letting the partition associated to an rc - graph be the boxes whose label matches the row number in the @xmath132-tableau corresponding to the rc - graph .",
    "this is an injection since the edelman - greene correspondence is injective , and this is therefore a bijection due to proposition [ prop : count ] .",
    "the bijection given in section [ sect : elem - bij ] is the same as the one given by the edelman - greene correspondence .    for an rc - graph with @xmath26 cross pieces in the @xmath46-th row ,",
    "the edelman - greene corrspondence produces a tableau with @xmath26 occurrences of the letter @xmath46 , or , equivalently , a partition whose conjugate has exactly @xmath145 parts of size @xmath59 .",
    "an rc - graph for any permutation of @xmath13 has @xmath146 places , and therefore @xmath147 elbow joints , in the @xmath46-th row , so the two bijections are the same .    since the proof of proposition [ prop : elem - bij ] gives a surjection and the edelman - greene correspondence",
    "is known to be an injection , a purely bijective proof omitting the counting lemma is possible .",
    "since @xmath11 is its own inverse in @xmath148 , transposing an rc - graph for @xmath11 gives another rc - graph for @xmath11 .",
    "it is a natural question to ask what this involution translates to on partitions .",
    "unfortunately , the description of this involution on partitions is not immediately evident .",
    "however , described on bracketings of a string of length @xmath44 subject to a binary nonassociative operation , it turns out to be simply reversing the string along with the brackets .",
    "equivalently , under the obvious bijection to binary trees , this corresponds to flipping the tree along its vertical axis .",
    "we describe the map from rc - graphs for @xmath11 to bracketings as follows . for convenience ,",
    "let the `` letters '' of the string be the numbers from @xmath149 to @xmath44 .",
    "now , let @xmath33 be an rc - graph for @xmath11 , and for each @xmath150 ( the set of locations of ( nontrivial ) elbow joints in @xmath33 ) , place a left bracket before the letter @xmath117 and a right bracket after the letter @xmath151 .",
    "it is clear such a map is injective and sends the transposition involution on rc - graphs to reversal of order on parenthesizations .",
    "what remains to be shown is that this actually gives a proper full bracketing for a binary associative operation . actually , more than this is true ; the pair of brackets aassociated with each elbow joint is in fact a matching pair .",
    "we prove this by induction on the generalized inverse chute moves in the proof of proposition [ prop : elem - bij ] .",
    "@xmath108 corresponds to the bracketing @xmath152 , and each elbow joint clearly corresponds to a matching pair of brackets .",
    "now suppose there is valid generalized inverse chute move moving an elbow joint at @xmath50 to @xmath106 .",
    "the elbow joint at @xmath50 corresponds to a matching pair of brackets with the left bracket before the letter @xmath117 and the right bracket after the letter @xmath151 .",
    "the second condition for a valid generalized inverse chute move forces the next right bracket to also occur between the letters @xmath151 and @xmath153 ; the first condition forces us to have another left bracket to the left of the letter @xmath117 matching a right bracket after the letter @xmath154 , although this could be an imaginary pair of brackets around the letter @xmath117 ( corresponding to a trivial required elbow joint at @xmath155 ) .",
    "the remaining conditions merely state that the original pair of brackets is a matching pair , which for us is true by induction .",
    "we can draw the situation as follows :    @xmath156    the generalized inverse chute move shifts the parentheses to the following configuration :    @xmath157    clearly , the new pair of brackets is a matching pair whenever we start with a proper full bracketing . translated into the language of binary trees , this operation is ( left ) rotation , an operation used in many schemes for keeping binary search trees balanced .",
