    "the possibility to have the unification of the gauge interactions has been a guiding principle for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) since the paper by georgi , quinn and weinberg in 1974  @xcite .",
    "the simplest grand unified theory ( gut ) was proposed the same year in a seminal paper  @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , this theory is based on the @xmath2 gauge symmetry and the sm matter of one family is unified in two different representations .",
    "unfortunately , this simple gut theory is ruled out by the present values of the coupling constants . at the same time ,",
    "in the original version of the theory  @xcite there are no massive neutrinos and a relation between the yukawa couplings for the charged leptons and down quarks , @xmath3 , is predicted , which is in disagreement with the experiments .",
    "one of the main predictions of gut theories is the decay of the lightest baryon  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the great effort of many experimental collaborations one has today very impressive lower bounds on the different partial decay lifetimes  @xcite . in the future , the searches for proton decay will continue and hopefully it will be finally discovered .",
    "see for example  @xcite for a review of future experiments . from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is very difficult to make strong predictions for the lifetime of the proton since in most of the theories the grand unified scale needs to be predicted with great precision , the nucleon - meson matrix elements are not well - known , or the supersymmetric character of the theory might led to a large model dependence .",
    "see  @xcite for a review of proton decay predictions in several theoretical frameworks . since proton decay is a smoking gun signature for gut theories one should try to make the best predictions in the simplest scenarios .",
    "as we have explained above the simplest , but not realistic , gut theory was proposed by georgi and glashow in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if one sticks to renormalizability there are , however , three possible ways out to construct realistic theories :    * _ renormalizable @xmath2 with type i seesaw _ : as it has been known for a long time in order to have a consistent model for charged fermion masses at the renormalizable level one has to introduce an extra higgs in the @xmath4 representation  @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "at least two fermionic singlets are needed to generate neutrino masses through the type i seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been studied in detail in  @xcite and  @xcite . from the results presented in  @xcite it is possible to conclude",
    "that once one imposes the most conservative bound on the mass of the higgses mediating proton decay this theory is ruled out by proton decay experiments . * _ renormalizable @xmath2 with type ii seesaw _ : in this scenario the higgs sector is composed of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the neutrino masses are generated through the type ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "one can conclude already that this model is not appealing since the higgs sector is very complicated .",

    "@xcite is the simplest renormalizable @xmath2 theory , we study its possible phenomenological predictions in detail .",
    "we study for the first time the properties of the full lagrangian of the theory , computing all fermion masses .",
    "we find that there is only one possible scenario for the masses of the fermions in the adjoint representation which is allowed by unification and proton decay .",
    "we notice that the neutral component of the real scalar triplet living in the adjoint representation could be a possible candidate for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe . using the proton decay and dark matter constraints",
    "we find that the possible solutions for the mass spectrum in the theory allowed by unification are reduced considerably .",
    "using these results we predict upper bounds on the partial proton decay lifetimes , that can be tested at future proton decay experiments .",
    "the possibility to have light exotic fields , like scalar color octets , is discussed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we discuss the main properties of _ adjoint _ @xmath2 and its main predictions .",
    "the predictions coming from the unification of gauge interactions are discussed in section iii .",
    "the dark matter constraints and the upper bounds on the proton decay partial lifetimes are discussed in sections iv and v , respectively .",
    "the possible light exotic fields are pointed out in section vi , while in section vii we summarize our results . in the appendix",
    "a we write down all details of the theory , the matter content and all interactions . finally , in appendix b we list all contributions of the fields present in the theory to the running of gauge couplings .",
    "a new renormalizable gut theory based on the @xmath2 symmetry where the neutrino masses are generated through the type i and type iii seesaw mechanisms has been recently proposed in ref .",

    "we discuss the main properties of this theory in order to understand its main phenomenological predictions .    * : as in any theory based on @xmath2 , the sm matter is unified in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 representations . in order to generate the neutrino masses through the type i  @xcite and type iii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms an extra matter field in the adjoint representation @xmath13",
