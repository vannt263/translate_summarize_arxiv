    "the conventional hadron spectrum can be well understood in quark model where mesons consist of a quark and an anti - quark while ( anti)baryons consist of three ( anti)quarks .",
    "however , the fundamental theory of strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) does not forbid the existence of exotic states with more than three valence quarks such as tetraquarks , pentaquarks , hexquarks , and so on .",
    "jaffe  @xcite first predicted the existence of h - dibaryon , a hypothetical bound state consisting of @xmath4 with spin - parity @xmath5 , using a bag model approach .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations  @xcite also suggest the bound h - dibaryon with strangeness @xmath6 and spin - parity @xmath5 may exist , although this needs to be confirmed by the physical point simulations  @xcite .",
    "a relevant and interesting question is about the possible existence of other exotic dibaryon states including nucleon - hyperon bound states like @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "these studies would be extremely useful for understanding the largely uncertain nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .    to understand the @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction , the star collaboration  @xcite at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) recently measured the @xmath3-@xmath3 correlation function for centrality @xmath10 au+au collisions at @xmath11  gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a positive scattering length @xmath12 ( decreasing phase shift ) is obtained by analyzing the data using lednicky - lyuboshits  ( ll ) model formula .",
    "however , an opposite sign of @xmath13 is favored  @xcite by using koonin - pratt  ( kp ) formula .",
    "these two apparently contradictive conclusions can be understood  @xcite in the ll model formula with different values of @xmath3-@xmath3 pair purity probability @xmath14 which is still largely uncertain .",
    "therefore , more experimental measurements are needed to further constrain the details of the @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction and thus to determine if the bound @xmath15 state can exist or not . very recently , the alice collaboration  @xcite at large hadron collider ( lhc ) searched for weakly decaying @xmath0 and @xmath16 exotic bound states in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath2  tev , and no bound states of @xmath0 and @xmath16 are measured in the decay modes @xmath17 and h - dibaryon @xmath18 . the obtained upper - limits of the yields ( @xmath19 at mid - rapidity ) are found to be , in a large range of decay branching ratio ( br ) , much lower than the predictions of various models , including the equilibrium thermal model  @xcite , the non - equilibrium thermal model  @xcite , a hybrid urqmd calculation  @xcite , and the coalescence model with both hadron and quark coalescence  @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the experimental measurement and these existing model predictions seems to exclude the existence of the @xmath0 and @xmath16 exotic bound states .",

    "therefore , it is interesting to explore the production of @xmath0 and @xmath16 in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath2  tev in a more realistic coalescence model , and this is the main motivation of the present work .    in this paper",
    ", we carefully calculate the yields of the @xmath0 and @xmath16 exotic states in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath2  tev by combining the covariant coalescence model  @xcite together with a blast - wave - like parametrization  @xcite for the phase space configurations of constituent particles at freezeout .",
    "we demonstrate that while the yields of molecule - state and six - quark - state @xmath16 as well as molecule - state @xmath0 are much higher than the experimental upper - limits , the six - quark - state yield of @xmath0 could be lower than the experimental upper - limits .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that @xmath0 could be a six - quark state although it is unlikely to be a molecular state .",
    "the coalescence model  @xcite and the thermal model  @xcite provide two main approaches to describe the composite particle production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the main feature of the coalescence model  @xcite is that the coalescence probability depends on the details of the phase space configurations of the constituent particles at freezeout as well as the statistical weight and wave function of the coalesced cluster , while these details are of no relevance in the thermal model  @xcite of cluster creation . for particle production at mid - rapidity in central pb+pb collisions at",
