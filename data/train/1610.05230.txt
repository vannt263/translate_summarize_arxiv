    "a randomly branched tree is a finite connected set of bonds that contain no closed loops and which is embedded in a @xmath13 dimensional space . aside from their importance in statistical physics  @xcite and the intriguing connection to relevant physical problems as percolation  @xcite ,",
    "randomly branched trees have received particular attention for being practically implicated in the modelling of branched  @xcite , ring  @xcite and supercoiled  @xcite polymers .    as customary in polymer physics  @xcite , the behavior of randomly branched trees can be analyzed in terms of a small set of exponents describing how expectation values for observables characterising tree connectivities and conformations vary with the weight , @xmath4 , of the trees or the contour distance , @xmath14 , between nodes : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 denotes the average branch weight ; @xmath17 the average contour distance or length of paths on the tree ; @xmath18 the mean - square spatial distance between nodes with fixed contour distance ; @xmath19 the mean - square gyration radius of the trees ; @xmath20 the average number of intra - tree pair contacts ; @xmath21 the average number of pair contacts between different trees in melt . by construction , @xmath22 , and the relation @xmath23 is expected to hold in general  @xcite .",
    "exact values for the exponents are known only for a very few number of cases . for ideal non - interacting trees , the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 where @xmath13 denotes the dimension of the embedding space . for interacting trees , the only known exact result  @xcite is the value @xmath27 for self - avoiding trees in @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",

    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) to ( [ eq : nu ] ) , of a wide range of interacting tree systems .",
    "while being remarkably successful though , due to its simplicity flory theory is inevitably affected by serious known shortcomings and limitations  @xcite .",
    "they are , for instance , manifest in ( small ) deviations of predicted from observed or exactly know values for exponents as those defined in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : beta ] ) . in the case of linear chains ,",
    "these limitations are much more pronounced in the distribution functions for the corresponding observables which contain a wealth of additional information .",
    "little seems to be known about the even larger range of configurational distribution functions for interacting trees . in the following , we present numerical results based on a detailed analysis of five different tree ensembles , which we have simulated in @xcite : ( i ) ideal randomly branching polymers , ( ii ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 melts of interacting randomly branching polymers , ( iii ) @xmath1 self - avoiding trees with annealed connectivity and ( iv ) @xmath1 self - avoiding trees with quenched ideal connectivity .",
    "we analyse the distributions along the lines of known relations for ideal trees and linear chains and propose a coherent framework , including generalised fisher - pincus relations , relating most of the exponents characterising the distribution functions to each other and to the contact and flory exponents for interacting trees .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] we briefly summarise the theoretical background and list a number of useful results for ideal and interacting linear chains and trees . in section  [ sec : modmethods ] we give a few details on the numerical methodologies employed for simulating the trees and analysing their connectivity .",

    "flory theories are formulated as a balance of an entropic elastic term and an interaction energy  @xcite : @xmath42 in the standard case of self - avoiding walks , @xmath43 represents the entropic elasticity of a linear chain , while @xmath44 represents the two - body repulsion between segments , which dominates in good solvent . for interacting trees",

    ", the free energy of @xmath69 per blob implies that the exponents @xmath70 is given by  @xcite @xmath71 interestingly , knowledge of the two exponents is sufficient to reconstruct the entire distribution function , because the constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 are determined by the conditions ( 1 ) that the distribution is normalized ( @xmath74 ) and ( 2 ) that the second moment was chosen as the scaling length ( @xmath75 ) : @xmath76      lattice trees are believed to fall into the same universality class as lattice animals  @xcite with their number scaling similarly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_saw ] ) : @xmath77 in particular , the tree and animal critical exponents in @xmath13-dimensions are related to the lee - yang edge singularity  @xcite of the ising model in an imaginary magnetic field in @xmath78-dimensions , suggesting a relation between the entropy and the size @xmath79 interestingly , this relation suggests that it is possible to estimate the number of self - avoiding trees using flory theory .",

    "quantitative details as well as tabulated values for single - tree statistics are presented in the supplemental material .      to simulate randomly branching polymers with _",
    "annealed _ connectivity , we employ a slightly modified version of the `` amoeba '' monte - carlo algorithm  @xcite for trees on the cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions . in the model , connected nodes occupy adjacent lattice sites .",
    "as there is no bending energy term , the lattice constant equals the kuhn length , @xmath80 , of linear paths across ideal trees .",
    "the functionality of nodes is restricted to the values @xmath81 ( a leaf or branch tip ) , @xmath82 ( linear chain section ) , and @xmath83 ( branch point ) .",
    "we have studied ideal non - interacting trees , @xmath1 self - avoiding trees , and @xmath0 and @xmath1 melts of trees .",
    "in addition , we have studied randomly branched trees with _ quenched ideal _ connectivity . for this ensemble ,",
    "we have resorted to an equivalent off - lattice bead - spring model and studied it via molecular dynamics simulations . in this model ,",
    "trees are represented by the same number of degrees of freedom , with bonds described as harmonic springs of average length equal to @xmath80 .",
    "this allows a one - to - one mapping to and from the lattice model .",
    "furthermore , beads interact with a repulsive soft potential whose strength is tuned in such a way , that the gyration radii of self - avoiding lattice trees remain invariant under the switch to the off - lattice model , if their quenched connectivities are drawn from the ensemble of self - avoiding on - lattice trees with annealed connectivity .    for all our ensembles ,",
    "the tree sizes are @xmath84 for ideal and self - avoiding trees  @xcite and @xmath85 for melts of trees  @xcite .",
    "we have analysed tree connectivities using a variant of the `` burning '' algorithm for percolation clusters  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm works iteratively : each step consists in removing from the list of all nodes the ones with functionality @xmath86 and updating the functionalities and the indices of the remaining ones accordingly .",
    "the algorithm stops when only one node ( the `` center '' of the tree ) remains in the list . in this way , by keeping track of the nodes which have been removed it is possible to obtain information about the mass and shape of branches",
    ". the algorithm can be then generalized to detect the minimal path length @xmath87 between any pair of nodes @xmath88 and @xmath89 : it is in fact sufficient that both nodes `` survive '' the burning process .      as discussed in detail in our former works",
    "@xcite , extrapolation to the large-@xmath4 limit of scaling exponents is a delicate issue . in general , in fact , our data are affected by finite - size effects and extracted exponents are either ( i ) effective ( crossover ) exponents valid for the particular systems and system sizes we have studied or ( ii ) _ estimates _ of true , asymptotic exponents , which suffer from uncertainties related to the extrapolation to the asymptotic limit .    _",
