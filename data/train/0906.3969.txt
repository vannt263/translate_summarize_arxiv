    "kaluza - klein weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) arising from theories with extra dimensions have come under increased scrutiny @xcite alongside wimp candidates from supersymmetric particle theories , e.g. the neutralino . +",
    "several analyses @xcite performed on the data from the amanda - ii and the icecube detectors have already put limits on the neutralino induced muon flux from the sun comparable to that of direct detection experiments .",
    "the first excitation of the kaluza klein ( kk ) photon , @xmath0 , in the case of universal extra dimensions ( ued ) with one extra dimension , annihilates to all standard model particles .",
    "this results in the production of a detectable flux of muon neutrinos in the icecube detector .",
    "@xmath0 is often referred to as the lkp - lightest kaluza - klein particle .",
    "kk - momentum conservation leads to the stability of the lkp , which makes it a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "compared to neutralino wimps , lkps come from a relatively simple extension of the standard model and , consequently , branching ratios ( see table i ) and cross sections are calculated with fewer assumptions and parameter - dependences .",
    ".possible channels for the pair annihilation of @xmath1 and branching ratios of the final states .",
    "figures taken from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_1 ]    this feature allows us to perform a combined channel analysis for an lkp particle .",
    "another consequence of the simple ued model is that with the assumption of a compactified extra dimension scale of around 1tev , the particle takes a much narrower range of masses @xcite from the relic density calculation - ranging from @xmath2 gev to @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev to @xmath5 gev if coannihilations are accounted for @xcite .",
    "moreover , collider search limits rule out lkp masses below @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we describe an ongoing solar wimp analysis with the ( 2001 ) amanda data .",
    "furthermore , we derive for the combined geometry of @xmath7 icecube strings ( ic22 ) and amanda ( to be referred to as the combined analysis in the rest of the paper ) the projected sensitivity on the muon flux and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross section obtained for lkp wimps with data from the year 2007 .",
    "+ the amanda - ii detector , a smaller predecessor of icecube with @xmath8 oms on @xmath9 strings , ordered in a @xmath4 m by @xmath10 m diameter cylindrical lattice , has been fully operational since 2001 @xcite .",
    "the icecube detector , with its @xmath11 string deployed this season , is much larger with increased spacing between the strings and will have a total instrumented volume of @xmath12km@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the set - up in 2007 for the combined analysis consisted of @xmath7 icecube strings , and the @xmath9 amanda strings , with a separate trigger and data acquisition system . the detector geometry for both amanda - ii and ic22 is shown in fig .",
    "a solar wimp analysis can be thought of as using the earth as its primary physical filter for data , as one only looks at data collected when the sun is below the horizon at the south pole , @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "single , @xmath15 , and coincident , @xmath16 , atmospheric muons that come from cosmic ray showers in a zenith angle range @xmath17 of @xmath18 $ ] , constitute the majority of the background , whereas the near - isotropic distribution of atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath19 , will form an irreducible background .",
    "the atmospheric muon backgrounds are generated using corsika @xcite with the hrandel cr composition model @xcite .",
    "for the atmospheric neutrino background , produced according to the bartol model @xcite , anis @xcite is used . for the combined analysis , the simulated @xmath15 background has a detector - livetime of @xmath20 days , @xmath16 of @xmath21 days and @xmath19 of @xmath22 years .",
    "wimpsim @xcite was used to generate the signal samples for lkp wimps , consisting of @xmath23 million events per channel for wimp masses varying from @xmath24 gev to @xmath25 gev .",
    "individual annihilation channels ( three @xmath26 s , @xmath27 , and t , b , c quarks ) , contributing to @xmath28 s at the detector , were generated for the combined analysis , as well as for the amanda only analysis ( in the latter case for the energy range from @xmath4 gev to @xmath29 gev ) .",
    "muon and erenkov light propagation in antarctic ice were simulated using icecube / amanda software such as mmc @xcite , ptd and photonics @xcite .",
    "finally , amasim for amanda and icesim for the combined detector were used to simulate the detector response .",
    "the signal detection efficiency of the two detector configurations is given by the effective volume , @xmath30 , which is defined for a constant generation volume , @xmath31 , by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of observed lkp events and @xmath34 the number of generated lkp events , undergoing charged - current interaction within @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath30 is a good quantity to compare lkp detectability at trigger level for the two analyses , shown in fig .",
    "+ after deadtime correction , 142.5 days of data when the sun was below the horizon were available in 2001 with a total number of @xmath35 recorded events for the amanda analysis .",
    "the combined analysis is utilizing a projected total livetime of @xmath36 days of data for the calculated sensitivities in this paper .",
    "+   + the main purpose of the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the various background sources is to show that a good agreement with experiment is achieved , demonstrating a sufficient understanding of the detector .",
    "thus , it is viable to assume that the lkp signal samples are simulated correctly within the amanda / icecube simulation - chain and can be used to select the different cut parameters for the higher cut levels @xmath37 , because their difference from background in different parameter distributions can be clearly identified .",
    "the actual cut value of each cut level is obtained by maximizing the efficiency function , or a figure - of - merit , for simulated lkp signals and the experimental background sample , which consists of data taken when the sun was above the horizon and therefore contains no solar wimp signal .",
    "setting cut values based on experimental background datasets has the advantage that possible simulation flaws are minimized .",
    "lkp signals are point sources with very distinct directional limitations ( zenith angle theta , @xmath38 ) . hence , the general strategy of filtering for both analyses is to apply strict directional cuts in early filter levels . @xmath39 and @xmath40 consist of calibration , reconstruction and making a simple angular cut of @xmath41 on the first - guess reconstructed track .",
    "this leads to a passing efficiency of around @xmath42 for all lkp signal samples , and reduction of around @xmath43 for both , data and muon background .",
    "all events passing the @xmath44 level are reconstructed using log - likelihood methods ( llh ) .",
    "@xmath45 is a two dimensional cut on the reconstructed llh - fit zenith angle ( @xmath46 ) within @xmath47 and the estimated angular uncertainty of the llh track .",
    "@xmath48 picks reconstructed tracks , which are nearly horizontal and pass the detector , to further minimize vertical tracks associated with background events . the multivariate filter level , @xmath49 , consists of two different multivariate analysis routines from the tmva @xcite toolkit , namely a support vector machine ( svm ) together with a gaussian fit - function and a neural network ( nn ) .",
    "the input variables for the two algorithms are obtained by choosing parameters with low correlation but high discrimination power between background and signal .",
    "the individual output parameters are combined in one multivariate cut parameter @xmath50 .",
    "after the @xmath49 cut , only the combined analysis is discussed ] , the muon background reduction is better than a factor @xmath51 , which implies that the final sample is dominated by @xmath19 background .",
    "the solar search looks for an excess in neutrino events over the expected background in a specifically determined search cone towards the direction of the sun with an opening angle @xmath52 .",
    "events with a reconstructed track direction pointing back towards the sun within an angle @xmath52 are kept , where @xmath52 is optimized to discriminate between the @xmath53 background and a sum of all seven lkp channels , weighted with the expected branching ratios as listed in table i. + the expected upper limit , or sensitivity , for an expected number of background events @xmath54 is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the feldman - cousins upper limit for the number of observed events , @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the model rejection factor @xcite @xmath58 is used to determine the optimum opening angle @xmath52 of the solar search cone .",
    "here , @xmath59 is the number of surviving lkp events within @xmath52 .",
    "+   + under the assumption of no signal detection , it is possible to derive the feldman - cousins sensitivity discussed above for the combined detector with a total projected livetime of @xmath60 days .",
    "the expected number of events after cut level @xmath49 are estimated from a processed subset of observational data with a detector livetime of @xmath61 days .",
    "the results are then extrapolated to the total livetime @xmath62 , yielding an expectation of @xmath63 events .",
    "the corresponding expectation from the simulated background samples , @xmath64 , normalized to the data at filter level @xmath40 and extrapolated to @xmath62 , is @xmath65 .",
    "+ the expected sensitivity on the neutrino - to - muon conversion rate @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where the effective volume @xmath30 is given by eq .",

    "additionally , the combined effective volume , @xmath69 , for the expected @xmath70 spectrum is given by the sum of the individual @xmath30 per channel , weighted with the respective branching ratio of each channel .",
    "for the neutrino - to - muon conversion rate per single channel , the expected limit on the annihilation rate in the core of the sun per second is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an lkp annihilation channel ( @xmath73 ) and energy dependent constant .",
    "the sensitivity to the muon flux at a plane at the combined detector is derived via the calculation chain @xmath74 and is performed using the code described in @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the capture rate of lkps in the sun is entirely dominated by the spin - dependent component of the @xmath0-on - proton elastic scattering @xcite . consequently , presuming an equilibrium of @xmath80 , the sensitivity for the spin - dependent elastic scattering cross section gev / c@xmath81cm@xmath13 , and the rms velocity is set to @xmath83 km / s . ] of @xmath0",
    "can be calculated as , @xmath84 the estimated sensitivity for the spin - dependent cross section for lkps is displayed in figure [ fig4 ] , along with the most recently published limits from direct search experiments .",
    "the theoretical spin - dependent cross section predictions ( shaded area ) for lkps are taken from @xcite and are plotted for different predictions for the mass of the first kk - excitation of the quark .",
    "we showed that a competitive result on the spin - dependent cross - section of lkp - on - proton scattering can be obtained with the combined geometry of amanda - ii and icecube-22 , which explores parts of the unrejected regions in the theoretically predicted lkp - region .",
