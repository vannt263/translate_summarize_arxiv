    "the quark gluon plasma is of great interest since it represents our first case study of the emergent physics of the non - abelian gauge theory qcd .",
    "a key step in understanding this state of matter is identifying its relevant coupling strength .",
    "the perturbative techniques of qcd are only adequate in a weakly coupled plasma , with calculations for strongly coupled plasmas constrained to methods like ads / cft - based approaches or resonance scattering . both weak and strong",
    "coupling based approaches have had their respective successes in the past .",
    "for instance , experimental @xmath3 measurements show surprisingly consistent agreement with predicions from pqcd based models @xcite , while ads / cft based calculations have fared strongly by predicting a global lower bound on the shear viscosity - to - entropy ratio of qgp - like systems of @xmath4 @xcite , when taking natural units , which is in line with hydrodynamic inferences from collider data at lhc and at rhic @xcite .",
    "both frameworks show qualitative agreement with @xmath5 @xcite , suggesting they are attaining sufficient maturity to investigate more differential observables .",
    "we will argue that the momentum correlations of heavy quarks constitute a promising candidate as a differentiator between weakly and strongly coupled plasmas .    in @xcite , the azimuthal correlations of heavy @xmath6 pairs in a weakly coupled plasma in pb+pb collisions ( @xmath1 )",
    "were studied , both for a model involving purely collisional energy loss and one additionally incorporating radiative corrections .",
    "these weak coupling based azimuthal correlations provide a secondary indicator for the momentum correlations and we will compare them with computations from an ads / cft correspondence exploiting energy loss model sensitive to thermal fluctuations , the latter already having been introduced in @xcite . as in @xcite , we will probe the spectrum of reasonable ads / cft based energy loss models with two plausible t hooft coupling constants ( @xmath7 & @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) with the additional requirements that , for the former , temperature and the yang - mills coupling are equated , while in the latter case , energy density and the coupling are equated .",
    "the calculations will be performed for the same transverse momentum classes as in @xcite and also both with leading order and next - to - leading order production processes used for the initialisation .",
    "additionally , we will consider momentum correlations that take initial momentum correlations into account .",
    "these will provide evidence that heavy quarks traversing a strongly coupled plasma are more likely to stay correlated in momentum than they would if inside a weakly coupled plasma .",
    "the following will outline our computational procedure and its background .",
    "subsequent to initializing the momenta of bottom quark pairs either to leading order with fonll @xcite or to next - to - leading order with amc@nlo @xcite using herwig++ @xcite for the showering , the production points of the bottom quarks are weigthed by the glauber binary distribution @xcite .",
    "the particles are propagated through the plasma via the energy loss mechanism described in [ subsec : langevinenergyloss ] until the temperature in their local fluid cell drops below the @xmath10 threshold and hadronization was presumed to occur or @xmath11 had passed , being the maximum time of the vishnu background @xcite .      as shown in @xcite , the stochastic equation of motion for a heavy quark in the fluid s rest frame",
    "is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are longitudinal and transverse momentum kicks with respect to the quark s direction of propagation and with @xmath15 , the drag loss coefficient , being given by @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the mass of a heavy quark in a plasma of temperature @xmath18 with t hooft coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "the correlations of momentum kicks are given by @xmath20 where g is only known numerically @xcite and with @xmath21 as via eqn.[eqn : kappa_l ] , the coupling of the longitudinal fluctuations to velocity grows as @xmath22 , thus growing significant extremely quickly @xcite . as reasoned in @xcite ,",
    "the fluctuations are thus important to include for finite @xmath23 , as is the case for our probing models , where @xmath24 is lower than the speed limit on a quark , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , since any kick will be fully correlated to itself if the time scale of momentum kick correlations is small compared the time scale determined by the drag coefficient , we can model the colouring as white noise , hence treat @xmath27 as a dirac delta @xcite . by virtue of our requirement @xmath28 , it follows that @xmath29 , and we may thus safely approximate the colouring as white noise",
    ".    the computations based on this model will be labeled `` gubser '' .",
    "the problem with the energy loss mechanism described in [ subsec : langevinenergyloss ] is that since the longitudinal momentum fluctuations grow as @xmath30 , our setup breaks down for high momenta .    in @xcite ,",
    "the average squared distance travelled by offshell quarks in a strongly coupled is computed via the @xmath31 correspondence : as in @xcite , we consider @xmath32 of the free endpoint of a string initially at rest , where the other endpoint is fixed to a black hole horizon in @xmath33 . for",
    "asymptotically late times , we find @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 parametrizes between a heavy quark for @xmath37 and a light quark for @xmath38 . at late times",
    ", the motion is diffusive , thus we can extract the diffusion coefficient @xmath39 thus , the transverse momentum fluctuations are @xmath40 then we attain @xmath41 via @xmath42 the computations based on this model will be labeled `` mh '' .",
    "in fig.[fig:2dcorrelationsr ] , the @xmath43 correlations are depicted for representative sections of the respective @xmath44 classes .",
    "we observe that , for low @xmath44 , we attain very efficient broadening of the angular correlations . for mid @xmath44 ,",
    "the angular correlations are much tighter , however with greater broadening of the momentum correlations , at least in absolute terms . for @xmath9 , both angular and momentum correlations are typically much weaker than for @xmath45 , given the larger consequent drag coefficient of the former .",
    "in @xcite , at leading order , the weak coupling based computations exhibited very efficient broadening of initial azimuthal correlations for low @xmath44 @xmath0 pairs ( @xmath46\\text{gev}$ ] ) , which were entirely washed out once nlo production processes were taken into consideration .    both for mid- and high-@xmath44 ( @xmath46\\text{gev}$ ] & @xmath47\\text{gev}$ ] respectively ) ,",
    "the initial correlations were found to survive to a large degree , both at leading order and at next - to - leading order , suggesting that they may still be observable in an experimental context .",
    "we compare our strong coupling azimuthal correlations to the weak coupling ones in fig.[fig : azimuthalcorrelations ] . for @xmath48 $ ] ,",
    "our correlations are significant more peaked at their initial back - to - back correspondence . at @xmath49 $ ]",
    ", this observation still holds for the upper bound of our parameters with @xmath45 , while the @xmath9 bounded result is of similar magnitude but looser angular correlation than either the collisional or the collisional + bremsstrahlung based results . in the @xmath50 $ ] range , the azimuthal correlations are almost entirely washed out for @xmath9 , while for @xmath45 , they are broadened with similiar efficiency to the weak coupling results .",
    "what is striking about the low @xmath44 correlations depicted in fig.[fig : azimuthalcorrelations ] is the massive difference in normalized counts for this momentum class between strong and weak coupling : around an order of magnitude , in fact .",
    "navely , one may expect this to be caused by a more efficient suppression of high momentum particles in a strongly coupled plasma than a weakly coupled one . if we take initial momentum correlations into account fig.[fig : initial momentum correlations ] , we find that the contribution of particles initially in a higher momentum class being suppressed down to @xmath51\\text{gev}$ ] clearly do not suffice to account for the order of magnitude difference observed .",
    "in fact , the dominant portion of particles with low final transverse momentum had low transverse momentum initially too",
    ". on the one hand , this could be due to these particles ending up in other final momentum classes . from fig.[fig : azimuthalcorrelations ] , it is clear they do not end up in @xmath46\\text{gev}$ ] or @xmath47\\text{gev}$ ] .",
    "this only leaves @xmath52\\text{gev}$ ] and @xmath53\\text{gev}$ ] , the latter being highly unlikely .",
    "a more plausible explanation is that in a weakly coupled plasma , @xmath0 pairs are much more weakly correlated in momentum and are thus more likely to end up in distinct momentum classes .",
    "since this effect is observed in the low momentum domain , one may postulate that the momentum fluctuations in a weakly coupled plasma are more significant that in a strongly coupled plasma .",
    "thus , it would be more likely for low momentum heavy quarks to receive momentum kicks that elevate them to higher momentum classes in the weakly coupled plasma .     of @xmath0 pairs with @xmath45 and initial momentum in some given class . ]",
    "as depicted in fig.[fig : nlo_final ] , the correlations for the @xmath51\\text { gev}$ ] class are entirely washed out , as they ve been in @xcite . for mid- to high-@xmath44 , while the peak around @xmath54 has been broadened , the computations suggest that this signal should still be observable in an experimental context . unfortunately , we had no data from weak coupling calculations for a similar centrality to compare with .",
    "correlations for nlo initialization . ]",
    "we have compared the azimuthal correlations predicted by pqcd and ads / cft based computations and found that , while the azimuthal correlations are qualitatively similar , the momentum correlations tell a different tale . in particular , the surprise of our findings is the large dissimilarity in low momentum correlations the pqcd and ads / cft based simulations exhibit .",
    "thus , bottom quark momentum correlations present an opportunity to distinguish between the energy loss mechanisms of the two frameworks .",
    "although stronger momentum fluctuations in the weakly coupled plasma have been identified as a plausible explanation for this disparity , we can not assert this with certainty until initial correlations for the weak coupling based correlations have been considered as well .",
    "furthermore , whether this order of magnitude difference in predictions for low momentum correlations of heavy quarks exposes weaknesses in either or both of the frameworks can not be declared until experimental data of bottom quark momentum correlations emerges .",
    "strong coupling based approaches have so far fared better in the low momentum domain , where pqcd is restrained by uncertainties in the running coupling .",
    "while discriminating initial momenta in the momentum correlation plots fig.[fig : initial momentum correlations ] is illuminating , producing these is impossible in the current paradigm of detectors , and thus their applicability is restricted to simulations .",
    "that being said , the integrated momentum correlations may constitute a potent experimental discriminator of strongly and weakly coupled plasmas and demand further investigation .",
    "the authors wish to thank the south african national research foundation ( nrf ) and the sa - cern collaboration for generous support of this work .",
