    "level 2 event data were retrieved from the _ chandra _ data archive and reduced with the ciao ( @xcite ) 4.4 software and the _ chandra _ calibration data base ( caldb ) 4.5.3 , adopting standard procedures . after excluding time intervals of background flares exceeding @xmath19 with the lc_sigma_clip task",

    ", we find a significant @xmath22 ( improvement in psf fwhm as defined in @xcite ) from sub - pixel repositioning for an on - axis source at 6 - 7 kev ( @xmath23 at @xmath17 kev because of the narrower psf ) .",
    "most of the imaging improvement is from sub - pixel binning , which uses the sampling of the psf by the well characterized spacecraft dither motion . because of the similarly ` peaked ' inner psf this is similarly effective at 2 and 6 kev .    the resulting full band ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) acis image",
    "is presented in the left panel of figure [ fullband ] .",
    "this figure shows complexity in the central region of arp 220 , but there is no x - ray feature that can be univocally associated with the radio / ir nuclei .",
    "instead , narrow band imaging ( 6 - 7 kev containing the fe - k lines ) reveals these hidden nuclei ( figure [ fullband ] , right panel ) .",
    "the only sources of emission in this spectral band are localized in two regions separated by @xmath24 ( corresponding to @xmath0 pc at a distance of 76 mpc ) and co - located with the nir @xmath25 @xcite and radio nuclei @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we have shifted the _ vla _",
    "6 cm sources in the ne direction by @xmath26 in order to match the position of the western lobe with the western nucleus .",
    "we note that the eastern radio lobe results somewhat dislocated from eastern narrow - band nucleus .",
    "however , due to the low counts in this region , the location of this emission is consistent within uncertainties with the radio lobe . under this",
    "assumptions , radio , nir and fe - k nuclei are consistent within astrometric uncertainties .",
    "deeper _ chandra _ x - ray observations are needed for convincingly evaluate if the position of the e nucleus is in better agreement with the ir or radio position .",
    "we note that the extension of the narrow - band emission in the east direction is not due to psf asymmetries , as indicated by the make_psf_asymmetry_region tool that shows psf artifacts in the north - west direction .",
    "we extracted counts from the 0.5 circles centered at ra=15:34:57.252 dec=+23:30:11.64 ( w ) and ra=15:34:57.326 dec=+23:30:11.84 ( e ) ( figure [ hardbands ] , upper panel ) ; _ chandra _ absolute astrometric uncertainty is 0\".6 .",
    "we find in the 6 - 7 kev band 12 counts associated with the western nucleus ( w ) , and 3 counts associated with the eastern nucleus ( e ) .",
    "note that the background emission in this band is 0.01 counts in the same area of the extraction regions , so even a 3 counts detection is a highly significant source ( @xmath27 of chance detection , corresponding to a @xmath28 gaussian significance ) .    given the energy dependent grade branching ratio for bi acis ccd @xcite , and since sub - pixel repositioning is more uncertain for 1 pixel ( grade=0 ) events than for 2 pixel ( grade=2,3,4 ) and 4 pixel ( grade=6 ) events , we checked the event grade distribution in w and e regions to ensure reliability of events position with ser .",
    "the majority of w region events are 2 and 4 pixel , while no 1 pixel event is found in e region .",
    "therefore sub - pixel analysis improves the positioning of these events .",
    "the flux in this band , however , is highly uncertain due to the low counts . in this case ,",
    "approximate narrow - band model - independent fluxes can be estimated with the ciao aprates tool , to yield @xmath29 ( e ) and @xmath30 ( w ) .",
    "these correspond to 6 - 7 kev observed luminosities @xmath31 ( e ) and @xmath32 ( w ) .",
    "the locations of these unique emission regions strongly argue for an identification of these sources with the nuclei of the merging galaxies .",
    "although the w source is positionally coincident with the x-4 hard x - ray source reported by @xcite ( see figure [ fullband ] ) , the sub - pixel narrow band imaging suggests a different picture .",
    "figure [ hardbands ] ( middle panel ) shows the 3 - 6 kev band image , where the most prominent source is found to the west of both w and of the reported x-4 position @xcite .",
    "figure [ hardbands ] ( lower panel ) shows the emission in the 7 - 10 kev band , suggesting hard continuum emission from the w nucleus ( 3 cts ) with @xmath33 of chance detection .",
    "the ciao aprates tool gives in this region @xmath34 cts , while we derive a firm 2 counts upper limit in the e nucleus region .",
    "these images suggest the presence of highly obscured ct agn in the nuclei .",
    "the narrow - band images ( figure [ hardbands ] ) also show that the continuum emission from the nuclei is contaminated by unrelated sources even at _ chandra _ resolution . nevertheless , we attempted a spectral characterization of the emission , extracting 3 - 8 kev spectra from the two circular regions ( 0.5 \" radius ) indicated in figure [ hardbands ] with the ciao specextract task , applying point - source aperture correction .",
    "we then fitted simultaneously the two spectra employing the cash statistic .",
    "we used a model typical of ct agn emission @xcite , comprising an absorption component fixed to the galactic value @xmath35 , a pure neutral reflection component ( pexrav ) with a spectral index fixed to 1.8 and a gaussian fe - k line .",
    "we used both xspec ( ver .",
    "12.7.1 ) and sherpa with identical results .",
    "the extracted spectra and the best - fit parameters are presented in figure [ spectra ] and table [ table2]-@xmath8 confidence level for one parameter of interest . ] , respectively .    given the contamination of the continuum emission by non - nuclear sources , our estimate of the nuclear continuum luminosity is an upper limit , and the fe- k ews must be considered as lower limits .",
    "the spectral analysis detects fe - k line features in both regions , with comparable ew ( 1.1 kev and 0.9 kev in w and e region , respectively ) .",
    "as expected from the imaging , the fe - k line is more luminous in the w nucleus ( @xmath36 ) with respect to the e ( @xmath37 ) ; we note that these values are consistent within errors with the narrow - band ( 6 - 7 kev ) luminosities obtained with aprates tool .",
    "as already discussed , the _ observed _ 2 - 10 kev luminosities , @xmath38 ( w ) and @xmath39 ( e ) , should be considered as upper limits because of contamination .",
    "our detection of large fe - k ews from both nuclei may seem at odds with the results of @xcite , who did not detect fe - k emission using the same chandra acis data . to investigate this discrepancy , we repeated the analysis of the entire central emission of arp 220 , following the procedure of these authors . using a circular 4.5 \" radius count extraction region centered at ra=15:34:57.194 dec=+23:30:12.40 , and their fitting model ,",
    "we confirm their results ( table [ table ] , left column of results ) .",
    "however , the authors fixed the fe - k line rest - frame energy fixed at 6.4 kev .",
    "if , instead , we allow the gaussian line rest - frame energy to vary , we detect a line at @xmath40 kev with and equivalent width of @xmath41 kev , compatible with the _ xmm - newton _ detection at @xmath42 kev @xcite ; all the other model parameters remain unchanged ( see the right column in table [ table ] ) .",
    "as demonstrated by figures [ fullband ] and [ hardbands ] there is no 6 - 7 kev emissions in regions outside the nuclei , even when the overall x - ray emission is more prominent .",
    "we have also extracted the spectrum of the softer luminous regions west of the w nucleus shown in figure [ hardbands ] ( middle - right panel ) centered at ra=15:34:57.207 dec=+23:30:11.84 , and find no evidence of line emission .",
    "we analyzed the four archival _ xmm - newton _ observations of arp 220 ( the two discussed in @xcite , and two new ones performed in 2005 ) in order to test the possible contribution of a neutral iron emission line to the 6 - 7 kev emission we see in figure [ hardbands ] .",
    "the data were reduced following a standard procedure , analogous to the one described by @xcite .",
    "the results are also in agreement : in a continuum plus single line model we obtain a best fit peak energy @xmath43 .",
    "however , if we fit the data with two lines with fixed peak energies @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45 , we obtain the results shown in figure [ contours ] : a neutral component accounting for up to 40% of the observed line flux can not be ruled out at a 90% confidence level .",
    "if we then consider that 40% of the fe - k line flux we estimate from _ chandra _ spectra is due to",
    "fe - k@xmath11 neutral 6.4 kev emission line , the 2 - 10 kev _ emitted _ luminosities inferred from the fe - k luminosities are @xmath46 ( w ) and @xmath47 ( e ) .",
    "we note that these corrections are calibrated on  standard \" obscured seyfert galaxies , with an x - ray reflection efficiency of a few percent @xcite .",
    "hard x - ray observation of ulirgs have demonstrated that on average this efficiency is much lower for these sources @xcite .",
    "consequently , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the two agn detected here could be significantly higher .",
    "considering the values for a standard reflection efficiency , the inferred x - ray luminosity is at least a factor of 3 higher than that expected from a pure starburst with the bolometric luminosity of arp 220 .",
    "the chandra acis sub - pixel narrow - band imaging of the central region of the ulirg merger arp 220 provides compelling evidence of two ct agns , in both nuclei of the merging galaxies . within the central 5x5 ",
    ", there are _ only _ two sources detected in the 6 - 7 kev band , containing the fe - k lines .",
    "although the e nucleus is detected with only 3 counts , the very low field background ( @xmath48 ) makes this a @xmath49 detection ( section [ data ] ) .",
    "the centroids of these sources , @xmath1  apart , are consistent , within _ chandra _ astrometric uncertainty of 0.6  , with the position of the two nir nuclear clusters identified by @xcite , and each coincident with a 6 cm vla radio source @xcite ( figure [ fullband ] ) .",
    "we note that the w source is also consistent with the variable radio sources reported by .",
    "we stress that _ no emission _ in the 6 - 7 kev band is detected from other parts of the central region of arp 220 , even where the diffuse emission from the starburst is most intense .",
    "while the detections are highly significant for both nuclei , the fluxes are more uncertain , given the small number of detected photons ( see section [ data ] ) .    the spectral analysis of both the central 4.5  region , and of the individual e and w nuclei , results in the detection of emission lines . the rest energy of the line is larger than the 6.4 kev of the k@xmath11 line , and suggests a contribution from 6.7 kev shock - ionized fe xxv line as concluded by @xcite , which could be associated with the starburst - induced shock ( see e.g. the strong extended fe xxv emission in ngc 6240 @xcite ) .",
    "however , if we _ assume _ that both 6.4 kev and 6.7 kev lines are present in the spectrum , we obtain an acceptable fit to the _ xmm - newton _ data which allow for 40% 6.4 kev contribution .",
    "the statistics , however , do not allow us to disentangle these two contributions to the observed emission in _ chandra _ data .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ data ] , the line emission is only connected with the nuclear region , not with the more extended starburst .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , we find large @xmath50 kev equivalent widths for the fe - k lines ; simulated data show that shock - ionized gas can yield comparable ews for these lines , but would also yield continuum contribution much higher than we observe .    besides a definite detection of hard photons ( @xmath51 kev ) from the w nucleus ,",
    "which is also consistent with it being a ct agn , the continuum emission from the nuclear regions is not easy to establish because of contamination from the surrounding emission in the 3 - 6 kev band . in particular , the w nucleus is significantly contaminated by the softer emission of a source or extended emission area nearby , which could be connected with the starburst phenomenon .",
    "this complex circumnuclear emission impedes the measurement of the nuclear continuum by means of spectral fitting .",
    "any determination of the nuclear continuum with lesser spatial resolution data will give an even higher overestimation of its strength .",
    "considering the above caveats , we can only set an upper limit of @xmath52 to the ratio between the observed and the inferred intrinsic luminosities for the two nuclear sources ( see section [ data ] ) .",
    "this limit is consistent with the ratio between the observed luminosities of less obscured and ct agns .",
    "the spectra of the two nuclear sources presented in figure [ spectra ] are in fact typical of ct agns , with observed fe - k ew @xmath10 kev .    the possibility of arp 220 harboring one heavily obscured agn has been discussed by @xcite with _",
    "_ beppo__sax and _ xmm - newton _ data ; these authors conclude that , due to lack of hard emission above 10 kev , the ct agn should be enshrouded in absorbing clouds with column density exceeding @xmath53 and covering factor close to unity . even ignoring the contamination of the continuum by extra - nuclear sources",
    ", the low counts in the two regions do not allow us to estimate absorption through spectral fitting .",
    "we can however compare the x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the w source , for which we detect the hard nuclear continuum , with simulated spectra of obscured agns from .",
    "for this purpose we use only the spectrum at energies @xmath54 kev , where the continuum is low and less contaminated by the nearby source ( see figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the sed of the w nucleus is consistent with emission absorbed by @xmath55 . for comparison we extracted the spectrum from the bright region visible in figure [ hardbands ]",
    "( middle - right panel ) west of w region ; besides not showing any appreciable fe - k feature , it is also compatible with absorbing column densities @xmath56 .",
    "the two nuclei have radio fluxes of 112 ( w ) and 88.2 ( e ) mjy @xcite , and x - ray to optical ratios @xmath57 . from the inferred 2 - 10",
    "kev emitted luminosities of the two nuclear sources we evaluate bolometric luminosities assuming typical agn seds @xcite , and the x - ray reflection efficiency of seyfert galaxies , as discussed in section [ data ] .",
    "the estimated agn bolometric luminosities , which should be regarded as lower limits , are @xmath58 ( w ) and @xmath59 ( e ) . these represent only a few percent of arp 220 bolometric luminosity , confirming that overall the emission of arp 220 is dominated by the starburst component .",
    "this result is in broad agreement with the estimates from the mid - ir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "lower limits on associated bh masses can be evaluated assuming eddington limited accretion ( with a standard 10% accretion rate to luminosity conversion efficiency ) , yielding @xmath60 ( w ) and @xmath61 ( e ) .",
    "our results add to the evidence of ct agns arising as a result of the later stages of the merging evolution in galaxies , which may trigger accretion onto the supermassive black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after ngc 6240 @xcite and ngc 3393 @xcite , arp 220 provides the third clear case of the occurrence of this phenomenon in the near universe . as ngc",
    "6240 @xcite , arp 220 is a highly disturbed system of galaxies engaged in a major merging interaction .",
    "the physical projected separation of the ct nuclei is @xmath62 pc in ngc 6240 and @xmath63 pc in arp 220 , suggesting that the latter may be in a more advanced stage of merging .",
    "the third case , the apparently regular early- type spiral ngc 3393 , with two ct nuclei separated by 150 pc @xcite , suggested instead a more evolved merger , or perhaps a minor merger of unequal size galaxies .",
    "interestingly , following the discovery of the double nuclear x - ray source , evidence of a merger past has surfaced in the optical spectra of this galaxy @xcite .",
    "we have found compelling evidence for two ct agns , associated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies in the nearest ulirg arp 220 , making this galaxy the third case of detection of close pair ct agns ( a few 100 pc apart ) , after ngc 6240 and ngc 3393 .",
    "these nuclei are the sole regions of significant 6 - 7 kev emission in the central 2 kpc of arp 220 .",
    "the data are consistent with fe - k line emission although at an energy possibly higher than 6.4 kev of the fe - k@xmath11 line , suggesting substantial contribution from fe xxv emission lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis of the entire _ xmm - newton _ dataset confirms the presence of fe xxv emission line , but allows 40% of the narrow - band emitted flux form the neutral 6.4 kev line .",
    "albeit uncertain - the spectral analysis of these regions suggests large @xmath1 kev ews .",
    "the w nucleus was also detected at hard ( @xmath51 kev ) energies implying absorption @xmath64 ; at such energies no continuum emission was detected from the e nucleus .",
    "our results are consistent with previous multi - wavelength indications of nuclear activity in arp 220 ( see section [ intro ] ) , and strengthen the evolutionary association of merging and nuclear activity in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the fe - k detections , we infer lower limits on the bolometric luminosity of the agns of @xmath65 for the w agn , and @xmath66 for the e agn .",
    "these are a few percent of the total ulirg bolometric luminosity , confirming that overall the emission of this source is dominated by the starburst component , as estimated from the mid - ir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "these results have only been possible because of the unmatched _ chandra _ spatial resolution , and the use of sub - pixel imaging in narrow spectral bands , which expose the telltale fe - k emission of ct agns , and give us a clear picture of the nuclear surroundings .",
    "although the fe - k band detections of the two nuclei are highly significant , the paucity of photons results in large uncertainties for all derived quantities .",
    "a significantly longer _ chandra_/acis exposure will be needed to firmly measure the emission parameters of the two nuclei .",
