    "in the past years , the extraction of information on hadronic resonances from lattice qcd data has become of great interest .",
    "recent lattice studies of this subject can e.g. be found in @xcite , and references therein . in quantum field theory ( qft ) ,",
    "resonances are associated with poles of scattering or transition amplitudes on unphysical riemann sheets of the complex energy surface pertaining to these amplitudes , and all properties of the resonance should refer somehow to these poles in the complex plane @xcite . in a finite volume , however , the energy spectrum is discrete , and the correlators and amplitudes are purely real in euclidean time .",
    "there are no branch cuts and no riemann sheets , and it therefore seems nontrivial to relate the measurements in a finite box to the resonance phenomena observed in ( or extracted from ) experimental data .",
    "of course , the theory needed to close this gap is already well - developed , see @xcite for the `` classic '' articles on the subject , and @xcite for some recent developments . in the literature just cited , the problem with which we deal here is examined in much more depth and generality than is attempted in the present article . here",
    ", we focus on a specific simple field - theoretic toy model - perhaps the simplest one that shows all the features we want to study on a basic level ( resonance dynamics in a finite volume , extraction of data related to a form factor in the time - like region in the presence of a resonance ) , but is still consistent with the field - theoretical strictures of unitarity and analyticity .",
    "our first aim is to provide the practitioner ( i.e. , people who are concerned with the analysis of realistic lattice data ) with an explicit model , as a testing ground for the methods used to deal with real hadronic resonances in lattice qcd .",
    "our second aim is to present an amenable representation of a non - trivial ( momentum - projected ) two - point correlator which can be used for pedagogic purposes , since we have often noticed that the relation between resonance physics and finite - volume , euclidean - time lattice data is often hard to understand for students in the field of lattice qcd , or even for researchers in related areas .",
    "our third aim is to make some technical details of the relevant derivations and calculations available , which are often hard to retrace from the original papers on the subject .",
    "here we try to be as explicit as possible .",
    "we do not treat discretization effects , and we shall neglect , for the most part , those finite - volume effects which are exponentially suppressed with the spatial extent of the finite box , like e.g. finite - volume corrections to masses and coupling constants . the methods to deal with the latter modifications are very well - known , see e.g. @xcite .",
