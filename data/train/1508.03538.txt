    "a lottery is _",
    "maximal _ for a given ordinal preference profile if it is welfare - maximizing for the canonical utility representation . in the context of voting , maximal lotteries are almost always unique and ordinal mechanisms that return maximal lotteries form an attractive class of randomized voting rules @xcite .",
