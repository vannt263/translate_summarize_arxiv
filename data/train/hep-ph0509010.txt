    "several atoms play basic roles in modern physics and , in fact , very different roles .",
    "a unit of time , the second , is defined via the hyperfine interval in the cesium atom , while the atomic mass unit and the avogadro number are defined via the mass of a carbon atom .",
    "these two atoms are significant for our system of units , si . in addition , there are some favorite atomic systems where the basic laws of nature find their expression in the most transparent way . these simple atoms , most of which consist of two bound particles , have been crucial for our understanding of key moments of modern physics and their study is still of essential interest and importance .",
    "the simplicity and harmony of the theory of bound systems have been tempting and challenging for a while .",
    "johannes kepler believed the solar planetary system to be governed by a harmony of discrete numbers via geometry , trying with the so - called _ platonic _ or _",
    "regular solids_. he failed to verify that kind of the harmony and discovered instead some regularities in the planetary orbital motion known now as kepler s laws .",
    "his discovery became a milestone in the development of theory of gravitation and mechanics and eventually led to the establishment of new mechanics ( classical mechanics ) .",
    "three centuries after the kepler s time , a planetary model was suggested for atoms .",
    "meantime certain regularities in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom were discovered .",
    "those regularities , like the kepler s laws , led once again to the establishment of new mechanics ( quantum mechanics ) and simultaneously realized the kepler s dream of the harmony of numbers governing the orbital motion .",
    "by now we know that a quantity describing a classical object can be of an arbitrary value while in the quantum case only discrete values are possible for some quantities . and",
    "this is how certain integer numbers enter the basic equations of modern physics .",
    "working on a new mechanics , a new dynamics or a new model , one used to try first to apply it to some ` simple ' objects .",
    "the simplest object is a free particle .",
    "however , only a limited number of properties of a free particle can be derived _",
    "ab initio _ and studied with a high accuracy .",
    "study of simple atoms opens a broad field for possible effects and applications .",
    "a two - body atomic system such as the hydrogen atom is a natural object to verify a new model or to test a new approach .",
    "studies of the properties of the hydrogen atom have already served to establish the so - called ` old quantum mechanics ' ( the bohr theory ) , modern nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , relativistic quantum mechanics ( based on the dirac equation ) and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which was the first successful quantum field theory .",
    "perhaps , we should even say that qed is the only quantum field theory which is successful for a really broad range of problems from atomic spectra to scattering , from low energy , related to microwave radiation , to high energy phenomena with hard annihilation and bremsstrahlung , from nano- to giga- electronvolt .    figure  [ 00hydr ] shows several crucial contributions to hydrogen energy levels .",
    "we note here that one of reasons for choosing a non - relativistic equation by schrdinger over a relativistic klein - gordon - fock equation was an incorrect description by the latter of the fine structure effects in the latter .",
    "another remark on importance of the hydrogen atom for qed is that the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron was first discovered by rabi and his colleagues @xcite as an anomaly in the hyperfine structure of hydrogen .",
    "immediately that was interpreted as a possible anomaly related to a free electron and only afterwards was that confirmed by a direct experiment .",
    "a historic overview of the ` contribution ' of the hydrogen atom to modern physics can be found in @xcite .",
    "levels are labelled by the values of the principal quantum number @xmath1 , orbital moment @xmath2 , electron angular momentum @xmath3 and atomic angular momentum @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the nuclear spin .",
    "the gross structure ( @xmath6 ) is well explained by the bohr theory ( so - called ` old quantum theory ' ) and schrdinger theory which also predicts the hyperfine structure ( @xmath7 ) . the fine structure ( @xmath8 )",
    "is explained by the dirac theory while the lamb shift ( @xmath9 ) is a result of bound state qed effects .",
    "meanwhile effects of quantum electrodynamics for free particles are responsible for the @xmath10 anomaly in the hyperfine structure .",
    "[ 00hydr ] ]    one can expect that the simplest atoms are the easiest for a theoretical prediction .",
    "that is true only in part .",
    "a simple atom usually possesses a simple spectrum which has relatively simple and transparent properties .",
    "the atomic energy levels are often perturbed during measurements by various external factors such as a residual magnetic or electric field .",
    "because of the simplicity of the spectra , there is a good chance to understand the influence of those external factors on simple atoms . as examples of the highest - precision experiments on simple atoms , we remind here that the hyperfine interval in the ground state of hydrogen was the most accurately measured physical quantity for a few decades and today the @xmath11 interval in the hydrogen atom is among the most precisely measured values .    decade after decade , theorists and experimentalists investigated simple atoms . as a result",
    "their theory is the most advanced atomic theory and it has to compete with very sophisticated experiments .",
    "the theory of simple atoms goes now far beyond non - relativistic quantum mechanics with the reduced mass of an electron .",
    "one has also to take into account relativistic effects , recoil effects , quantum electrodynamics , effects of the nuclear spin and nuclear structure .    in an early time of modern physics a list of simple atoms consisted of hydrogen only and later",
    "deuterium , neutral helium and helium ion were added .",
    "now the list is much longer and quite impressive .",
    "it also contains tritium , hydrogen - like ions of almost all elements ( and other few - electron ions ) .",
    "artificial two - body atoms are the easiest to produce and the list also includes muonium and positronium , muonic atoms , pionic , kaonic and antiprotonic atoms , exotic bound systems of two unstable particles ( such as pionium and @xmath12-atoms ) and antihydrogen .",
    "often accuracies of theory and experiment are not compatible .",
    "however , there is a broad range of effects , for which theory and experiment approach the same high level of accuracy .",
    "the study of such effects forms a field called _ precision tests of bound state qed _ , which is reviewed in part here .",
    "a number of sources have contributed to uncertainty of such tests , and the current accuracy of qed calculations for free particles and two - body atoms is not a limiting factor for qed tests .",
    "the accuracy of the tests is limited by one of the three other sources :    * an experimental uncertainty ; * an inaccuracy of taking into account effects of the strong interactions ; * an uncertainty due to a determination of the fundamental constants .",
    "the latter enters consideration because theory is not in a position to give itself any quantitative predictions .",
    "it provides us with some expressions containing values of certain fundamental constants , such as the rydberg constant @xmath13 , the fine structure constant @xmath14 , the electron - to - proton mass ratio etc . to make a prediction",
    ", one needs first to determine the fundamental constants by extracting their values from some other experiments .",
    "thus , theory serves as a bridge between different experiments .",
    "that makes the determination of fundamental physical constants to be another important part of precision physics of simple atoms .",
    "the contemporary situation with the qed uncertainty being below the total uncertainty of any qed test is a result of significant theoretical progress for the two last decades .",
    "twenty or thirty years ago the qed uncertainty was often the dominant one .",
    "the _ precision tests of qed _ form a _",
    "multidisciplinary _ field involving atomic , nuclear and particle physics , laser spectroscopy , frequency metrology , accelerator physics , advanced quantum mechanics , quantum field theory etc .",
    "those tests are rather not to test qed itself , but to check the overall consistency of the results and methods from different fields and in part to search for possible new physics beyond the standard model . in doing more and more advanced qed calculations , we also need to verify our approaches to deal with infrared and ultraviolet divergences , renormalization and bound state problem for few - body atoms in the case of high order terms of perturbation theory .",
    "as already mentioned , the simplest object to test any theory is a free particle .",
    "a study with free leptons provides us with a possibility of testing the qed lagrangian .",
    "the most accurate data for a free particle are related to the anomalous magnetic moments of an electron and a muon . in the former case the limitation of the accuracy of a comparison of theory versus",
    "experiment is due to a determination of the fine structure constant @xmath14 while the latter qed test is limited by effects of strong interactions entering via hadronic intermediate states for the vacuum polarization effects and by the experimental accuracy .",
    "the qed theory of the anomalous magnetic moment is quite advanced including many hundreds of multiloop diagrams ( up to the four - loop level for the electron and five - loop level for the muon ) . that differs from a so called",
    "_ bound state qed _ , a quantum electrodynamics theory of simple atoms , which deals mainly with relatively few one - loop and two - loop diagrams , but those are not for free particles , but for the particles bound by the coulomb field .",
    "three - loop contributions are rather below the uncertainty of most of the bound qed calculations and if necessary can be calculated neglecting binding effects .",
    "these two qed theories , the free qed and the bound state qed , are very different in their approaches , problems and applications and it is worth to consider their tests separately .",
    "the bound state problem makes all calculations more complicated . intending to perform a calculation within the free qed",
    ", one can in principle find needed basic expressions in a number of textbooks . on the contrary ,",
    "the bound state qed is not a well - established theory and there are no published common prescriptions for the relativistic quantum bound problem .",
    "it involves different effective approaches to solve the two - body bound problem .",
    "precision tests of the bound state qed offer a number of different options :    * the approaches for the bound problem can be essentially checked with the low-@xmath15 two - body atomic systems like hydrogen and deuterium , neutral helium and helium ions , muonium , positronium , etc . at low value of the nuclear charge @xmath15 the binding energy is of order of @xmath16 and it is essentially smaller than the energy related to the rest mass @xmath17 of the orbiting particle .",
    "that is a regime of a weak coupling in contrast to the high-@xmath15 physics .",
    "the weak coupling allows efficient use of a perturbation expansion over the coulomb strength @xmath18 .",
    "many contributions of higher - order in @xmath18 are calculated diagrammatically and thus are closely related to other qed diagrams ( e.g. , for scattering theory ) .",
    "* studies of high-@xmath15 ions are related to a strong coupling regime , however , it is unlikely to provide us with more information on bound state qed because of substantial contributions due to the nuclear structure .",
    "such an investigation is rather useful for testing different nuclear models .",
    "however , in some particular cases , atomic systems with not too high @xmath15 can give some important information on higher order terms of the qed @xmath19 expansion .",
    "importance of particular atomic systems also depends on the energy interval under study .",
    "for instance , the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) interval depends more strongly on the nuclear - structure effects than the lamb shift , and the related calculations involve more details of the nuclear structure .",
    "the accuracy of the nuclear - finite - size contribution is often claimed to be very high , however , their uncertainty is customarily not well verified .",
    "it is often estimated from a variation of the result for an energy shift after application of certain models of the charge distribution while the charge radius is fixed .",
    "however , to claim such a calculation as an _ ab initio _ result , one has to reconsider first the original scattering and spectroscopy data on the nuclear form factor and related nuclear theory and to check how strongly they constrain the shape of the distribution in general and its parameters and afterwards to question how much the nuclear - size correction varies within allowed shapes and parameters .",
    "that may be done only on a nucleus - by - nucleus basis .",
    "lack of such a consideration in study of high-@xmath15 study reduces importance of the bound - state qed calculations , which are in such a case one more confirmation of applicability of the phenomenological model of the charge distribution .",
    "* studies of few - electron atoms involve electron - electron interactions . in the case of high @xmath15 ions ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction is proportional to @xmath14 , while the interaction between an electron and the nucleus is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "if the ion is highly charged with only few electrons remaining , the electron - electron interaction can be treated as a perturbation . as a result , at high @xmath15",
    "the electron must be treated relativistically , i.e. , no expansion over @xmath18 can be used , however , the treatment of the electron - electron interaction as a perturbation leads to the @xmath20 expansion .",
    "in the case of light atoms , electrons are essentially nonrelativistic but the electron - electron interaction is compatible with the nucleus - electron interaction .",
    "the few - electron atoms ( like , e.g. , the neutral helium atom or heavy lithium - like ions ) is the only case when the uncertainty of the qed calculations used to be a limiting factor for a comparison of theory versus experiment . * there are some other two - body atoms under investigation .",
    "they contain a muon or a hadron as an orbiting particle .",
    "the orbit in a muonic atom is much closer to the nucleus than in the case of a conventional atom with an orbiting electron , and the muonic energy levels are much more sensitive to the nuclear structure . in the case of a hadronic atom ,",
    "the orbit lies even lower than in a muonic atom , while the interaction of the orbiting particle and the nucleus is dominated by the strong interaction , in contrast to the electromagnetic interaction in conventional ( i.e. , electronic ) and muonic atoms .",
    "different exotic or muonic atoms offer a unique opportunity to study certain particle properties by spectroscopic means with high precision .",
    "frequently high-@xmath15 spectroscopy is quoted as a qed test _ at a strong field_. however , that is not exactly the case .",
    "a value of macroscopic meaning , such as the electric field strength * e * , has not much sense inside an atom .",
    "other details are more important . for example , the strength of the field can be characterized by the average potential energy @xmath21 which increases with the nuclear charge @xmath15 and the mass of the orbiting particle @xmath22 and decreases with the principal quantum number @xmath1 .",
    "the strongest field is related to high-@xmath15 atoms with an orbiting particle , heavier than electron , at the ground state .",
    "muonic atoms have been studied for a while and with @xmath23 they offer a test at a field stronger than in electronic atoms and at shorter distances @xmath24 the distance @xmath25 ( or a related characteristic value of the momentum transfer @xmath26 ) is another important characteristic of the electric field inside an atom .",
    "we also note that a characteristic value of the potential @xmath27 , the distance @xmath28 and the strength of the field @xmath29 strongly depends on a particular quantity under study .",
    "what we present above in eqs .",
    "( [ eaver ] ) and ( [ raver ] ) is related to the leading contributions to atomic energy levels .",
    "higher order corrections , such as qed corrections , may involve various short - distance effects with characteristic distance @xmath30 and momentum transfer of about @xmath31 .",
    "they correspond to higher field than long - distance effects .",
    "the case of _ strong fields _ at short distances in which a characteristic momentum transfer is higher than @xmath32 leads to an enhancement of polarization effects of the electron - positron vacuum . that makes the physics of muonic atoms quite different from that of conventional atoms .",
    "high-@xmath15 ions offer another opportunity  a _ strong coupling _ regime with the binding energy comparable to @xmath17 which implies a completely relativistic consideration .",
    "the strong - coupling regime is very different from perturbative weak - coupling one .",
    "the calculations are more complicated",
    ". they may be of interest for study of methods to be applied in the case of strong interactions .",
    "some of the high-@xmath15 results are important also for high - accuracy low-@xmath15 physics .",
    "however , one has to remember that the strong coupling is rather not a problem of qed , but a problem of its application . in this sense ,",
    "the stronger the coupling , the less ` simple ' the system . to study pure qed problems in more detail",
    "we should prefer a weak - coupling situation",
    ".    in muonic atoms the coupling constant and other parameters can take quite different values . while for @xmath33 the states of interest are @xmath34 , the principal quantum number @xmath1 for medium @xmath15 may be higher than 1 or 2 , which used to be common for the high-@xmath15 experiments with conventional atoms .",
    "however , in both cases ( muonic / exotic atoms and high-@xmath15 ions ) , understanding the nuclear properties is needed for any theoretical predictions .",
    "for instance , let us look at studies of the @xmath35 lamb shift in hydrogen - like uranium .",
    "recently , the experimental result was improved @xcite .",
    "the experimental uncertainty allows to check one - loop radiative corrections , but not two - loop effects calculated few years ago @xcite .",
    "those two - loop corrections are an object of intensive theoretical study and are of great interest ( see sects .  5 , 7 and 13 ) .",
    "the finite - nuclear - size uncertainty for the lamb shift in u@xmath36 is estimated at a level approximately tenfold below the experimental uncertainty .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the result was obtained @xcite ( see also @xcite ) by comparison of two distributions of the nuclear charge , which were the homogenous spherical distribution and the fermi distribution .",
    "the value of the mean square radius was fixed as @xmath37fm for both distributions . however , this result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from muonic uranium spectroscopy suggesting a modified fermi distribution , which is different from both distributions applied in @xcite .",
    "it was stated @xcite that the uncertainty presented there was of pure statistical nature , while the model - dependence had not been studied and related systematic error was not included .",
    "apparently , the characteristic atomic momentum in muonic uranium is much higher than in the conventional hydrogen - like uranium ion and muonic spectra are substantially more sensitive to the nuclear - shape effects than conventional ones . if one expects that a comparison of the homogenous spherical distribution and the fermi distribution leads to a plausible estimation of the finite - nuclear - size effects ( which should be verified ) , that should be applied first to muonic atoms to learn the systematic error of the mean square radius",
    "then , with a value of the radius related to each distribution , one should calculate the energy levels .",
    "that should substantially increase uncertainty .",
    "this example shows that how fragile qed tests with high-@xmath15 ions can be and how much work should be additionally done to develop them .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to give a brief review on _ precision _ physics of simple atoms related to the _ accurate _ tests of quantum electrodynamics for bound states and the determination of fundamental constants .",
    "because of that , we focus our considerations mainly on light hydrogen - like atoms ( hydrogen , deuterium , helium ion , muonium , positronium ) and some medium @xmath15 ions , where the nuclear structure and hadronic effects are not too significant and allow a crucial test of advanced qed theory with high order contributions .",
    "we distinguish here qed and bound state qed , which example is an application of qed to the simplest atoms .",
    "studying less simple atoms we deal not with just bound state qed , but with its realization for not - too - simple atoms .",
    "the additional problem may be related to strong field , strong coupling , crucial effects due to the nuclear structure , electron - electron interaction in few - electron atoms etc .",
    "definitely , a number of investigations of less simple atoms are of interest . however , dealing with them is to go beyond the simplest bound state qed .",
    "we note , that the light hydrogen - like atoms are the most attractive from a theoretical point of view .",
    "they involve neither electron - electron interactions , nor strong - coupling effects or so .",
    "we consider in the next section , what is the most favorite choice for experimental accuracy options in testing bound state qed for hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "that is related to the light atoms .",
    "they are also favorite in principle for theoretical accuracy , being the simplest atomic systems .",
    "that does not mean that study of other atoms are out of interest .",
    "first of all , what is important is not just an atomic system , but a certain transition there .",
    "as one can see in this review , certain transitions , or combinations of certain quantities , related to different transitions , may offer various theoretical or experimental advantages .    because of the simplicity of simple atoms and multidisciplinary nature of the _ precision tests of the bound state qed _ we have tried to review the results as simply and briefly as possible in order to make the paper readable by non - experts .",
    "detailed reference information on crucial theoretical contributions is collected in tables .    while considering qed , there is always the problem of selecting units . from a theoretical point of view",
    "one should like to simplify equations by applying relativistic units in which @xmath38 , or using the atomic units .",
    "meanwhile , from an experimental point of view the equations should be expressed in units convenient for measurements . in our paper",
    "we choose a compromise .",
    "all results are presented in the units of the si .",
    "however , we present , when possible , most of the results using natural constants as a kind of units . for example , to define the so - called fermi energy which is a result of the non - relativistic interactions of the electron and nuclear magnetic moments , we write for hydrogen @xmath39and thus the proton and electron magnetic moments are explicitly expressed in units of the bohr magneton .",
    "the other factors do not directly contain electron charge @xmath40 , but only the fine structure constant @xmath14 , which does not depend on a choice of ` macroscopic ' units ( in which it may be defined as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 depending on the definition of the unit for the electric charge ) .",
    "still , here we make an exception for numerical values of atomic energy , which are always expressed in frequency units , i.e. , in terms of @xmath44 .",
    "this is because it is widely preferred to write equations for energy , while the actually measured quantities are the transition frequencies , spectroscopic linewidths and decay rates .",
    "the most frequently used notations are explained in appendix  [ s : not ] .",
    "more details on physics of hydrogen - like atoms can be found in :    * various basic questions in books @xcite ; * an overall review with an extended comparison of theory and experiments related to sixties and early seventies in @xcite ; * minireviews on particular questions in @xcite ; * review on theory of light hydrogen - like atoms in @xcite ; * original results presented at _ hydrogen atom _ conferences and on international conferences of _ precision physics of simple atomic systems _ ( psas ) in @xcite .",
    "the books @xcite published in series _ lecture notes in physics _ , volumes 570 and 627 , are also available on - line .",
    "the recent psas conference on simple atoms took place in early august 2004 in brazil as a satellite meeting to the international conference on atomic physics ( icap ) .",
    "the coming psas meeting is scheduled for june 2006 in venice .",
    "a few problems related to our paper are not presented here in detail .",
    "* we consider the fundamental constants only in connection to simple atoms and qed . more detail on fundamental constants can be found in @xcite .",
    "* heavy few - electron ions , which are of a great interest for study of application of bound state qed to strong - coupling and few - electron systems , are reviewed in , e.g. , @xcite . * recent progress with exotic and muonic atoms",
    "is presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "study of such atoms are not of a big interest because of qed , on contrary , they deliver us a crucial information on other part of physics , namely , particle and nuclear physics",
    ".    most of this review was ready before new results on the fundamental constants @xcite became available and through out the paper we compare the qed - related results on the fundamental constants with a previous set of the recommended constants @xcite .",
    "we also note that a substantial part of qed results under review appeared between the publications of two recommended sets ( their deadlines for collecting the input data were 1998 and 2002 ) and most of recent results have been accommodated in @xcite .",
    "we start our review with an introductory discussion of spectra of simple atoms and related basic qed phenomena and next consider qed tests with hydrogen ( the lamb shift and hyperfine structure ) and other light atoms .",
    "we discuss studies of pure leptonic atoms such as muonium and positronium .",
    "in addition to spectra we consider the magnetic moments of bound particles in various two - body atomic systems .",
    "the concluding sections of the paper are devoted to fundamental constants and problems of the bound state qed .",
    "let us discuss the spectrum of simple two - body atoms in more detail .",
    "the gross structure of atomic levels in a hydrogen - like atom comes from the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential and the result is well known : @xmath45 where @xmath15 is the nuclear charge in units of the proton charge , @xmath46 is the reduced mass of the atomic orbiting particle ( mostly , an electron ) @xmath47 here , @xmath22 and @xmath48 are masses of the orbiting particle and the nucleus .      *",
