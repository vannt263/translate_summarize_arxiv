    "submillimeter observations provide a very effective way of detecting luminous galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the well - known negative k@xmath5correction for galaxies in the fir and submillimeter bands compensates the distance effect , making submillimeter observations equally sensitive to infrared luminous galaxies in a very wide redshift range of 2 @xmath17 10 @xcite .",
    "most submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) are known to be ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , 10@xmath18 l@xmath9 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath19 10@xmath8 l@xmath9 ) or hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hyperlirgs , @xmath21 10@xmath8 l@xmath9 ) , implying very intense star forming activity with sfr @xmath22 100 m@xmath9/yr .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite suggested that galaxy - galaxy major mergers can produce such an intensive star forming activity .",
    "the major - merger scenario for ulirgs predicts that a massive black - hole is also formed during merging .",
    "a ulirg will eventually turn into a classical qso after feedback from the central massive black hole repels most of its gas in the system and quenches star formation .",
    "a large spectroscopic survey for smgs with radio detection obtained the first smg redshift sample at @xmath23 ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "reproducing number densities and fir flux densities for this population has been a major challenge in the current theoretical @xmath24cdm frame @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed to adopt a flat initial mass function ( imf ) for smgs to match their redshift distribution and number counts .",
    "understanding the formation of higher redshift smgs ( @xmath25 ) is even more challenging .",
    "high - redshift smgs appear to be more luminous , for example , smg gn20 , the brightest source at 850@xmath2 m in the goods north field , has a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath26 .",
    "all detected smgs at @xmath25 have millimeter flux densities of 5 - 10@xmath27jy @xcite . at this redshift",
    "the millimeter band samples the same rest - frame wavelength as the submillimeter band for smgs at @xmath282 .",
    "these smgs would then have @xmath29 = 10 @xmath7 20mjy if they were at @xmath28 2 .",
    "the probability to find such a halo at @xmath16 4 is much lower that at @xmath14 2 .",
    "yet more and more high - redshift smgs have been identified through multi - wavelength photometry , permitting studies of their formation mechanism through their seds and other observed properties .",
    "observational identification of smg counterparts at high redshifts has been very difficult .",
    "a definite breakthrough was made with submillimeter and millimeter interferometric observations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite used the submillimeter array ( sma ) to detect radio - quiet millimeter sources in both goods - n and cosmos fields with a 2  angular resolution .",
    "the high resolution submillimeter observations of these sources permit identification of their optical and infrared counterparts .",

    "with such an extremely red color of h @xmath5 [ 3.6 ] @xmath22 4.0 , @xcite argued that gn10 must be at @xmath16 4 .",
    "the smgs in this study are all spectroscopically identified in 4@xmath17 5.3 .",
    "the first high redshift smg , gn20 , was identified at @xmath26 through observations of the co[4@xmath53 ] transition using the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite",

    "finally , the extremely red smg , gn10 , was also found to be at @xmath31 through the co[4@xmath53 ] line @xcite .",
    "there was also substantial effort in performing deep optical spectroscopy for optically faint millimeter sources in the cosmos field using the keck telescopes by @xcite , and obtained optical spectroscopic redshifts for capak4.55 , aztec1 and aztec3 at @xmath32 , 4.64 and 5.3 , respectively .",
    "subsequent millimeter spectroscopic observations detect of the co[4@xmath53 ] line from capak4.55 @xcite and co[2@xmath51 ] , co[5@xmath54 ] , and co[6@xmath55 ] lines from aztec3 @xcite , confirming their optical spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "there was no co detection from aztec1 in the band inferred from its optical spectroscopic redshift @xcite .",
    "aztec1 shows only uv absorption lines in its optical spectrum .",
    "additionally , aztec1 is a b@xmath5band dropout and has a very low radio - to - submillimeter flux density ratio , both of which are consistent with the source being at @xmath16 4 @xcite .",
    "finally , another smg , less j033229.4 - 275619 , in the goods - s field was identified at @xmath33 with both optical spectroscopy and millimeter co[2 - 1 ] line followup observations@xcite .    before the advent of the herschel space observatory ( hereafter herschel )",

    "@xcite carried out 350@xmath2 m observations for a small sample of smgs at 1 @xmath17 3 and obtained a mean dust temperature of 34 k and a mean radio - to - fir ratio of @xmath35 .",

    "most studies of high redshift smgs @xcite relied on their mid- infrared ( mid - ir ) seds to determine their properties and photometric redshifts .",
    "several groups @xcite successfully used the 4 irac bands to identify ulirgs , so - called `` bumpers '' , at @xmath14 2 based on the 1.6@xmath2 m bump shifting in either the 4.5 or 5.8@xmath2 m band . at @xmath16 4 ,",

    "the 16@xmath2 m limiting flux densities were used to constrain seds for the remaining objects .",

    "blind source extraction results in single - band catalogs @xcite but is not sensitive to very faint sources .",
    "prior - based catalogs @xcite use mips 24@xmath2 m source positions to guide the spire photometry .",
    "the hermes team has adopted this method to produce multi - wavelength catalogs , the so - called xid catalogs @xcite . depth and photometric accuracy for the xid catalogs",
    "critically depends on depth of the input mips 24@xmath2 m catalogs @xcite .",
    "several studies of high redshift smgs use spire photometry based on the hermes xid catalogs @xcite .",
    "we argue that the existing hermes xid catalogs in the cosmos and goods - n fields are , however , not optimized for our sample .",
    "first , the mips 24@xmath2 m catalog used for the xid catalog in the goods - n field is much deeper than that used in the cosmos field , which is likely to cause systematic differences in the spire photometry for the sources in each fields .",
    "second , some smgs have either very weak or absent mips 24@xmath2 m detections , therefore they are not included in the xid catalogs .",
    "for example aztec1 and aztec3 are not detected at 24@xmath2 m in scomos@xcite , however , the submillimeter / millimeter observations can be used to guide source identification in the herschel spire bands for these sources .",
    "we took advantage of our own ultra - deep mips 24@xmath2 m images for the sources in the cosmos field and the fidels mips 24@xmath2 m image in the goods - n field , and developed a very similar source extraction and photometry method to the one described in @xcite , but using submillimeter positions as priors for the sources of interest ( @xmath16 4 smgs ) and mips 24@xmath2 m positions for their neighbouring sources .",
    "our method proceeds as follows : we first model the herschel flux distribution for each smg and its unresolved neighboring objects in each stamp image .",
    "we use the spire point - spread - function ( psf ) to re - construct the flux distribution in each stamp image with the sma or radio position for each smg and mips 24@xmath2 m positions for the neighboring objects .",
    "we fit the model image to each observed stamp image with the flux density of each model object as free input parameter .",
    "the flux density for each object is then found from the best fits .",

    "our method yields very similar photometry for gn20 as that in @xcite and in @xcite . yet",
    "our 500@xmath2 m flux density for gn20 is lower than in @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the xid catalogs may under - estimate 500@xmath2 m photometry for high - redshift sources by assigning their flux densities to their neighbors .",
    "our photometry in 500@xmath2 m band may suffer the same problem , such a bias becomes worse when there are a number of neighboring sources in deep mips 24@xmath2 m images .",
    "we asses the reliability of our spire photometry through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the photometry derived for each target is critically dependent on its neighbor object distribution . because our fitting is based on well - determined sma or mips 24@xmath2 m positions , source positions are fixed in the simulation .",
    "we only randomized the flux densities and background counts according to their measured standard deviation .",
    "a total of 1000 simulated stamp images were created for each target in each spire band .",
    "we then run our photometry software on each of them and compare the measured flux densities with the input ones . in figure",
    "[ f : simu ] , we show the histogram of flux ratio between input and measured flux density in the simulation for all six objects at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath2 m .",
    "the mean flux ratio of @xmath40/@xmath41 indicates a possible bias of our actual photometry .",
    "this simulation shows that the distribution of @xmath40/@xmath41 for the 250@xmath2 m photometry is gaussian centered around unity , suggesting that the 250@xmath2 m photometry for most sources is very robust .",
    "the 350@xmath2 m histogram also shows a gaussian shape centering around unity , but with a few measurements much lower than input flux densities .",
    "we argue that the 350@xmath2 m photometry is reasonably reliable except for aztec3 .",
    "we do not apply the bias measured in the @xmath41/@xmath40 to the 250 and 350@xmath2 m photometry for the sources in the sample , because this bias is smaller than its standard deviation for most sources .",
    "the @xmath40/@xmath41 ratios for the simulated 500@xmath2 m photometry show a much wide distribution .",
    "a lot of measured flux densities are much lower than the input ones in the simulation , and their ratios are much larger and beyond the range in figure  [ f : simu ] .",
    "this means that our 500@xmath2 m photometry may be well underestimated .",
    "thus the measured 500@xmath2 m flux densities are not reliable and will not be used in the following analysis .",
    "the rest - frame near - infrared ( near - ir ) seds can be used to infer the energy source that powers infrared galaxies . in ulirgs and hyperlirgs both stellar light and agn - heated dust light can contribute to the rest - frame nir band .",
    "several groups @xcite used irac photometry to classify seds for ulirgs and hyperlirgs at @xmath14 2 .",
    "there are two types of seds for these ir galaxies : those dominated by stellar emission with the 1.6@xmath2 m bump shifting into the irac bands , known as `` bumpers '' @xcite ; and those having strong power - law dust emission in near - ir / mid - ir and subject to severe dust extinction in the optical band , known as dust obscured galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
