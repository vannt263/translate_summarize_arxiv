    "although the homogeneous model discussed before allows for a simplified intuitive understanding of the major effects of the ddi in the amplification process , a quantitative analysis of realistic experimental situations may be just achieved by properly considering the inhomogeneous trapping , and the corresponding inhomogeneous density @xmath110 of the @xmath4 bec . in this section",

    "note that the maximum grows monotonically from @xmath104 to @xmath106 .",

[ sec : hamiltonian ] the homogeneous lze plays typically no role in the spinor dynamics ( only at very low magnetic fields @xmath165  mg the ddi could induce the equivalent of the einstein - de haas effect  @xcite , and in this case the residual lze could play a role ) . however , magnetic field gradients can not be gauged out , and may play a relevant role in the spinor physics  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we analyze the effects that these gradients may have on the amplification dynamics .",
    "we shall show that even relatively weak gradients may have a significant effect on the amplification process .",
    "although magnetic - field gradients do not affect the gp equation for the @xmath4 bec , there is indeed a contribution to the effective hamiltonian for @xmath57 in the linear regime : @xmath166 which may be straightforwardly implemented into the matrix @xmath167 of the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eigenvalue - equation ] ) , @xmath168 with @xmath169 .",
    "the magnetic - field gradients have two main effects . on one side ,",
    "they modify the effective potential @xmath170 in a different way for @xmath171 than for @xmath172 .",
    "this reduces the overlap of the @xmath5 atom clouds with the @xmath4 bec and hence the scattering mediated transfer . on the other side , atoms placed at different locations experience different larmor precession frequencies .",
    "although this does not affect the local short - range interactions , it does modify the non - local ddi . for large - enough gradients this may lead to a time - averaged ddi  @xcite . for weak gradients , as those considered below , the explicit time dependence induced by the gradients must be considered .",
    "parametric amplification is handicapped by the presence of gradients as a result of these two combined effects .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the combined effect of the ddi and the magnetic - field gradient along the weak trap axis for @xmath106 .",

    "hence the transfer maximum is shifted down and to lower @xmath25 with decreasing @xmath98 and increasing gradient . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , in the presence of a magnetic field gradient the maximum of @xmath176 shows also a marked @xmath98 dependence .    hence , even rather weak gradients ( @xmath177  mg / cm ) may strongly modify the amplification dynamics , an effect which is enhanced by the presence of the ddi .",

    "this is indeed a crucial point , since otherwise , accidental @xmath98-dependences of the magnetic - field gradients may obscure the physical @xmath98-dependence characteristic of the ddi .",

    "previous experiments have shown that the number of atoms in @xmath178 states can be suppressed to @xmath179 by briefly applying a strong magnetic field gradient to purify the system  @xcite . due to the nature of the qze in @xmath2 @xmath3rb ,",
    "magnetic fields can be used to access positive values of @xmath25 , as required above .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gradient ] , the most significant requirement compared to previous experiments is related to the suppression of magnetic field gradients which could obscure the dipolar effects .",
    "appropriate experiments should be carefully designed to minimize all sources of field gradients from the vicinity of the atomic sample ( alternatively a magnetic shield could be placed around the sample ) . in state of the art precision measurements , field gradients",
    "are commonly suppressed below 1mg / cm  @xcite , which is sufficient to realize the mandatory experimental conditions ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : gradient ] ) .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows that the resonant spin transfer to the @xmath5 states depends strongly on the relative orientation of the weak trap axis and the external magnetic field .",
    "since it is difficult to change the orientation of a dipole trap while maintaining its trapping potential , experiments must be designed to vary the orientation of the external magnetic field . in this sense ,",
    "two sets of helmholtz coils are necessary to provide a homogeneous external magnetic field .",
    "one of them should be placed along the weak axis of the trapping potential to realize the @xmath104 configuration and another one along one of the strong axis to realize the @xmath106 case .",
    "both magnetic fields have to be calibrated , preferentially using precision microwave spectroscopy between the ground state hyperfine manifolds of @xmath3rb .",
    "such an experimental apparatus would also allow for a rotation of the field , since the currents in the two helmholtz coils could be adjusted to obtain a relative angle @xmath98 . in this way",
    ", it should be possible to perform a measurement analogous to that discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "finally , additional magnetic field gradients can be applied along both magnetic field directions to observe the suppression shown in fig .",
