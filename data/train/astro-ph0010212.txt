    "[ light ]    the emission from grb 000926 ot is fading in both @xmath4 and @xmath2 passbands .",
    "the flux decay of most of the earlier grb afterglows , barring a few , is generally well characterized by a single power law @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the flux of the afterglow at time @xmath29 and @xmath33 is the decay constant .",

    "the parameter @xmath39 controls the sharpness of the break , a larger @xmath40 implying a sharper break . with @xmath41 ,",

    "( 1999 ) to fit the optical light curve of grb 990510 afterglow .",
    "@xmath42 is the flux of afterglow at the cross - over time @xmath43 .",
    "the function describes a light curve falling as @xmath44 at @xmath45 and @xmath46 at @xmath47 . in jet models , an achromatic break in the light curve",
    "is expected when the jet makes the transition to sideways expansion after the relativistic lorentz factor drops below the inverse of the opening angle of the initial beam . slightly later",
    ", the jet begins a lateral expansion which causes a further steepening of the light curve .",
    "we use the observations in @xmath4 and @xmath2 to determine the parameters of the jet model using the above function .",
    "we find that the minimum value of @xmath48 is achieved for @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates that the observed break in the light curve is sharp , unlike the smooth break observed in the optical light curve of grb 990510 ( cf .",
    "stanek et al .",
    "1999 ; harrison et al . 1999 ) but similar to the sharp break observed in the optical and near - ir light curves of grb 000301c ( cf .",
    "sagar et al .",
    "in order to avoid a fairly wide range of model parameters for a comparable @xmath48 due to degeneracy between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( magnitudes corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath35 respectively ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath40 , we have used a fixed value of @xmath52 in our further analyses .",
    "the least square fit values of the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath53 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 then work out to be 1.74@xmath80.11  d , 21.27@xmath80.15 , 1.45@xmath80.06 and 2.57@xmath80.10 respectively in @xmath2 band , with a corresponding @xmath48 of 0.93 per degree of freedom ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the fit yields the host galaxy contribution to be @xmath51=24.41@xmath80.25 in @xmath2 .",
    "this is slightly fainter than the value @xmath12 23.9 estimated by fynbo et al .",
    "( 2000e ) from deep ccd imaging , but brighter than @xmath2=25.19@xmath80.17 derived from hst measurements ( price et al 2000b ) .",
    "the main reason for the discrepancy with the hst estimate is possibly the restriction of the hst photometry to within a 1.5 arcsec aperture , while no such cutoff has been applied to the photometric data used here .",
    "the derived values of the above parameters do not change significantly with larger adopted values of @xmath40 , although a marginal decrease in @xmath55 is noticed in doing so .    in @xmath4 band",
    "the available data is sparse , and a fit with fixed @xmath56 and @xmath57  d yields @xmath36=1.55@xmath80.11 , @xmath37=2.72@xmath80.48 and @xmath58=24.7@xmath81.0 .",
    "note the poor constraint on @xmath37 and b - magnitude of the host galaxy , because of the scarcity of measurements in the late light curve .",
    "one can improve the constraints on the decay indices somewhat by assuming a colour index for the host galaxy , and thereby fixing its b magnitude from the r magnitude determined above .",
    "the restricted aperture hst photometry reported by price et al ( 2000b ) indicate a @xmath59 colour index of 1.04@xmath80.53 for the host galaxy .",
    "fixing the value of @xmath58 at 25.5 using this mean colour index , the fit yields @xmath36=1.53@xmath80.11 and @xmath37=2.52@xmath80.12 . on the other hand , if the host galaxy has a flat spectral distribution similar to that for grb  990123 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ) , then @xmath59 colour will be @xmath60 ( which is allowed within the errors of the hst measurements and our light curve fits ) , and @xmath58 will be 24.9 .",
    "if we use this value for @xmath58 , then the best fit values of the decay constants become @xmath36 = 1.54@xmath80.10 and @xmath37 = 2.64@xmath80.12 .",
    "we can therefore say with confidence that within the range of host galaxy colours allowed by the light curves and the hst measurements , the decay indices in @xmath4 and @xmath2 bands are consistent with each other , and that the break in the light curve displays the achromaticity expected in the case of a lateral expansion of collimated ejecta .",
    "the best fit light curves for the @xmath2 and the @xmath4 bands , with an assumed host galaxy colour index of @xmath59=1.04 , are displayed in fig .  2 .",
    "the decay parameters derived here are consistent with those obtained by price et al ( 2000b ) from their measurements .",
    "we have constructed the grb 000926 afterglow spectrum on 2000 september 29.25 ut and 29.76 ut using the available optical , near - ir , radio and observations .",
    "these epochs were selected for the long wavelength coverage possible at the time of observations of flux by piro & antonelli ( 2000 ) and garmire et al .",
    "optical fluxes at the wavelengths of @xmath61 and @xmath62 passbands have been derived using the slope of the fitted light curve shown in fig . 2 for the epochs under consideration .",
    "the fluxes for the desired epoch at 8.46 ghz and @xmath20 wavelength are taken from frail & berger ( 2000 ) and di paola et al .",
    "( 2000 ) respectively assuming that the flux decay is similar to optical one .",
    "we used the reddening map provided by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) for estimating galactic interstellar extinction towards the burst and found a small value of @xmath63 mag .",
    "we used the standard galactic extinction reddening curve given by mathis ( 1990 ) in converting apparent magnitudes into fluxes and used the effective wavelengths and normalisations by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for @xmath61 and @xmath62 and by bessell & brett ( 1988 ) for @xmath20 .",
    "the fluxes thus derived are accurate to @xmath12 10% in optical and @xmath12 30% in @xmath20 .",
    "3 shows the spectrum of grb 000926 afterglow from to radio region .",
    "it is observed that as the frequency decreases the flux increases from to radio wavelengths . for a chosen frequency interval",
    ", we describe the spectrum by a single power law : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the flux at frequency @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the spectral index . in the to optical region at @xmath68 = 2.26 day ,",
    "the value of @xmath67 is @xmath690.02 , while in the to @xmath20 region , the value is @xmath700.04 . at @xmath71 = 2.77 day the value of @xmath67 is @xmath720.04 for to @xmath20 region .",
    "these values agree very well with the spectral slopes derived for the spectrum of the grb 000926 afterglow by piro & antonelli ( 2000 ) and garmire et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . during @xmath68",
    "= 1 to 4 days , the values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are almost the same indicating no change in the optical spectral index before and after the time @xmath43",
    ". however , the values of @xmath67 in optical ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 derived at @xmath77 and 3.9 day respectively ) and in optical to @xmath20 region ( @xmath78 at @xmath79 day ) are much steeper than those derived for the broadband ( x - ray to optical ) spectrum",
    ". this may indicate presence of intrinsic extinction in the grb 000926 afterglow .",
    "the amount of intrinsic extinction is determined in the following way assuming that the ot spectrum follows a single spectral slope from to near - ir . the observed flux at and @xmath20 wavelengths are used to determine @xmath67 as the extinction affects them least .",
    "this slope predicts the fluxes of grb 000926 ot at @xmath3 wavelengths .",
    "the differences between these predicted and the corresponding galactic extinction corrected observed fluxes are used to evaluate the intrinsic extinction . from these values , intrinsic extinction at @xmath20 is determined assuming that it follows the galactic extinction law given by mathis ( 1990 ) . the extinction corrected flux at @xmath20 and the observed flux",
    "are used to derive modified value of @xmath67 .",
    "this procedure is iterated till self consistent values of intrinsic extinction at @xmath3 and @xmath20 wavelengths are obtained . this yields @xmath80 mag and @xmath81 as the values for the intrinsic extinction",
    "these are in agreement with the values determined independently by price et al ( 2000b ) from their optical data .",
    "the observed fluxes corrected for both galactic and intrinsic extinction are also shown in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath67 derived from them are @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath84 2.26 and 2.77 days respectively .    in the light of above , we conclude that the value of @xmath67 is @xmath85 in to near - ir spectral region and it has not changed before and after @xmath43 during @xmath86 1 to 4 days .",
    "3 indicates that the peak frequency appears to lie in the millimeter region .",
    "this peak frequency is thus similar to that of grb 970508 ( cf .",
    "galama et al .",
    "1998 ) and grb 000301c ( cf .",
    "sagar et al .",
    "2000b ) but different from that of grb 990123 ( galama et al . 1999 ) where the peak is in radio region and that of grb 971214 for which the peak is in optical / near - ir waveband ( ramaprakash et al .",
    "1998 ) . from this",
    ", one may infer that the synchrotron peak frequency may span a large range in grb afterglows .",
    "the afterglow of a grb is thought to be synchrotron radiation from a relativistic shock driven into the circumburst environment . in this model , the light curves and spectral energy distributions are generally well fit by the power - law @xmath87 for a range of frequencies and times that contain no spectral breaks .",
    "the decay slope is dependent on the dynamics of the fireball , and the spectral slope on the importance of cooling , but within each regime @xmath33 and @xmath67 are functions only of @xmath88 , the power - law exponent of the electron lorentz factor .",
    "this provides a verifiable relation between the two observable quantities @xmath33 and @xmath67 , and a way to infer the fireball dynamics .",
    "there is recent evidence that the fireball in at least some grbs are not spherical but are collimated , like jets , into a small solid angle . in such cases , theoretical models predict a break and a marked steepening in the afterglow light curve ( mszros & rees 1999 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 , huang 2000 ) .",
    "the time of occurrence of this break in the afterglow light curve depends upon the opening angle of the collimated outflow .",
    "observational evidence for a break was found first in the optical light curve of grb 990123 afterglow ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ; kulkarni et al . 1999 ) and recently in that of grb 990510 ( stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) , grb 990705 ( masetti et al .",
    "2000 ) , grb 991216 ( halpern et al . 2000c ) and grb 000301c ( sagar et al .",
    "2000b ) afterglows . at late times , when the evolution is dominated by the lateral spreading of the jet , the value of @xmath33 is expected to approach the electron energy distribution index while the value of @xmath67 is expected to be @xmath89 if the cooling frequency is below the observing frequency and @xmath90 otherwise ( sari et al .",
    "the expected values of @xmath33 and @xmath67 at late times are thus in agreement with the corresponding observed values of @xmath91 and @xmath85 for grb 000926 indicating that the afterglow emission from grb 000926 is of jet type and not spherical , and that the cooling frequency is above the range of observed frequencies .",
    "the slope of the light curve before the break is then expected to be @xmath92 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is also consistent with the value @xmath93 derived by us . however , a much steeper late decay of flux with @xmath941 and @xmath12 5 , while the spectral index is the same ( @xmath95 ) , as reported by piro & antonelli ( 2000 ) and garmire et al .",
    "( 2000 ) respectively is not consistent with the simple jet model which predicts similar late flux decay in both optical and regions .",
    "it is possible that the geometry of the region emitting x - rays after the lateral spreading starts differs from that emitting at longer wavelengths , thus giving rise to apparent difference in the behaviour of the light curve .",
    "another area of possible disagreement with the standard fireball model is the sharpness of the break in the light curve . while the expected sharpness of the transition could depend on the density profile of the ambient medium ( kumar and panaitescu 2000 )",
    ", the very sharp transitions seen in grb  000301c and grb  000926 would be difficult to quantitatively explain in the standard fireball model .",
    "this is an area that deserves a detailed theoretical study .",
    "the anisotropy of the initial ejection needs to be incorporated into the derived energetics of the burst .",
    "the redshift @xmath96 determined for the grb  000926 afterglow by castro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) yields a minimum luminosity distance of 16.6 gpc for standard friedmann cosmology with hubble constant @xmath97 = 65 km / s / mpc , cosmological density parameter @xmath98 = 0.2 and cosmological constant @xmath99 = 0 ( if @xmath100 then the inferred distance would increase ) .",
    "the grb  000926 thus becomes the second farthest grb after grb  971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) amongst the grbs with known redshift measurements so far . if the original emission were isotropic , the observed fluence of @xmath101  erg/@xmath102 ( hurley et al . 2000 ) between 25100 kev , would yield the total @xmath103ray energy release to be at least @xmath104 erg ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "however , the estimated @xmath43 of 1.74 day implies , using the expression in sari , piran and halpern ( 1999 ) , a jet opening angle of @xmath106 radian , where @xmath107 is the number density of the ambient medium .",
    "this means that the actual energy released from the grb 000926 is reduced by a factor of @xmath108 relative to the isotropic value and becomes @xmath109 ergs .    of the over dozen grbs with known redshifts ,",
    "seven with inferred energy budget of @xmath110 erg ( assuming isotropic emission ) are grb  000926 ( discussed here ) ; grb 000301c ( sagar et al .",
    "2000b ) ; grb 991216 and grb 991208 ( sagar et al .",
    "2000a ) ; grb 990510 ( harrison et al . 1999 ) ; grb 990123 ( andersen et al . 1999",
    "; galama et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb 971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "recent observations suggest that grbs are associated with stellar deaths , and not with quasars or the nuclei of galaxies as some grbs are found offset by a median value of 3.1 kpc from the centre of their host galaxy ( cf .",
    "bloom et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , release of energies as large as @xmath111 erg or more in radiation is extremely difficult to accommodate within the popular stellar death models ( coalescence of neutron stars or the death of massive stars ) .",
    "however , evidence is now mounting in favour of non - isotropic emission , with grb  000926 the sixth known case after grb 990123 ( cf .",
    "castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ; kulkarni et al .",

    "sagar et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that all cases where the inferred isotropic equivalent energy is large , the emission actually is confined within narrow jets , with total energy much below the isotropic equivalent .",
    "the @xmath103ray energy released then becomes @xmath112 erg , a value within the reach of the currently popular models for the origin of grbs ( see piran 1999 and references therein ) .    the intrinsic visual extinction ( @xmath113 mag ) derived for the optical afterglow also carries a possible clue to the class of progenitor objects .",
    "extinction of comparable magnitude have been noticed also in grb 971214 ( @xmath114 mag , ramaprakash et al .",

    "the presence of dust extinction in the host galaxies broadly supports the proposal that grbs could be associated with massive stars embedded in star - forming regions of the grb host galaxies ( paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "we have determined @xmath3 magnitudes of 20 stars in the field of grb 000926 .",
    "these magnitudes are used to calibrate present photometric magnitudes of the ot of grb 000926 as well as those given in gcn circulars using differential photometric techniques .",
    "the light curves show a steepening which could be well understood in terms of a jet model .",
    "the parameters of the jet are derived by performing a non - linear least square fit of a broken power - law model to the light curves .",
    "the flux decay constants at early and late times are 1.45@xmath80.05 and 2.6@xmath80.1 respectively , and the break occurs at 1.74@xmath80.11 day .",
    "the break is sharp and similar to that in grb 000301c ( cf .",
    "sagar et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous spectral energy distributions determined for various epochs indicate that the spectral index of the grb 000926 afterglow has not changed significantly during this period .",
    "a steepening of the flux decay with no corresponding change in spectral index is expected of a jet evolution .",
    "the determined redshift yields a minimum distance of 16.6 gpc to grb  000926 , and the observed fluence yields an isotropic equivalent energy release of @xmath118  erg .",
    "however , the break in the light curve at 1.74 days translate to a collimated emission with an opening angle of @xmath119 radian , reducing the estimated energy release to @xmath120 erg .",
    "the late time flux decays at and optical wavelengths seem to be significantly different for grb 000926 afterglow .",
    "similarly , the flux decays of grb 991216 afterglow ( cf .",
