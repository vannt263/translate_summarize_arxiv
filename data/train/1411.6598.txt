    "recently there has been significant effort directed towards understanding the wave dynamics in photonic lattices arranged in a honeycomb structure cf .",
    "@xcite . due to",
    "the extra symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , dirac points , or conical intersections between dispersion bands , exist .",
    "this is similar to what occurs in carbon - based graphene @xcite where the existence of dirac points is a key reason for many of its exceptional properties .",
    "because of the correspondence with carbon - based graphene , the optical analogue is often termed ` photonic graphene ' . in lattices without edges the wave dynamics exhibit conical , elliptic , and straight line diffraction cf . @xcite .",
    "however when edges and a ` pseudo - field ' are present , remarkable changes occur and long lived , persistent linear and nonlinear traveling edge waves with little backscatter appear .",
    "these localized waves exhibit the hallmarks of topologically protected states , thus indicating photonic graphene is a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "substantial attention has been paid to the understanding of edge modes in both condensed matter physics and optics .",
    "interest in such modes goes back to the first studies of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) where it was found that the edge current was quantized @xcite .",
    "investigations related to the existence of edge states and the geometry of eigenspaces of schrdinger operators has also led to considerable interesting research @xcite .",
    "support for the possible existence of linear unidirectional modes in optical honeycomb lattices was provided in @xcite .",
    "these unidirectional modes were found to be related to symmetry breaking perturbations which separated the dirac points in the dispersion surface .",
    "the modes are a consequence of a nontrivial integer ",
    "topological \" charge associated with the separated bands .",
    "unidirectional electromagnetic edge modes were first found experimentally in the microwave regime @xcite .",
    "these modes were found on a square lattice which have no associated dirac points .",
    "recently though , for photonic graphene , it was shown in @xcite that by introducing edges and spatially varying waveguides that unidirectional edge wave propagation at optical frequencies occurs .",
    "the waveguides play the role of a pseudo - magnetic field , and in certain parameter regimes , the edge waves are found to be nearly immune to backscattering .",
    "the pseudo - magnetic fields used in the experiments @xcite are created by periodic changes in the index of refraction of the waveguides in the direction of propagation .",
    "the variation in the index of refraction has a well defined helicity and thus breaks ` time'-reversal symmetry ; here the direction of the wave propagation plays the role of time .",
    "the analytical description begins with the lattice nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite with cubic kerr contribution @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the input wavenumber , @xmath2 is the ambient refractive index , @xmath3 , referred to as the potential , is the linear index change relative to @xmath2 , and @xmath4 represents the nonlinear index contribution .",
    "the scalar field @xmath5 is the complex envelope of the electric field , @xmath6 is the direction of propagation and takes on the role of time , @xmath7 is the transverse plane , and @xmath8 .",
    "below , in section  [ sec : length - scale ] , concrete values are given for the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ lnlsd ] ) .",
    "@xmath9 is taken to be a 2d lattice potential in the @xmath7-plane which has a prescribed path in the @xmath6-direction .",
    "this path is characterized by a function @xmath10 , such that after the coordinate transformation @xmath11 the transformed potential @xmath12 is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "experimentally , the path represented by @xmath14 can be written into the optical material (  fused silica ) @xcite via the femtosecond laser writing technique  @xcite .",
    "since this technique enables waveguides to be written along general paths , we only require @xmath14 to be a smooth function . introducing a transformed field @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is induced by the path function @xmath17 via the formula @xmath18 eq .",
    "is transformed to @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ mlnlsd ] ) , @xmath16 appears in the same way as if one had added a magnetic field to eq .  ;",
    "hence * a * is referred to as a pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "taking @xmath20 to be a typical lattice scale size , employing the dimensionless coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is input peak power , defining @xmath26 with @xmath27 , rescaling @xmath16 accordingly , and dropping the primes , we get the following normalized lattice nls equation @xmath28 the potential @xmath29 is taken to be of honeycomb ( hc ) type .",
    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath30 is the strength of the nonlinear change in the index of refraction .",
    "we also note that after dropping primes , the dimensionless variables @xmath31 are used ; these dimensionless variables should not be confused with the dimensional variables in eq .",
    "( [ lnlsd ] ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , which in turn was motivated by the experiments in @xcite , this paper examines the case of periodic pseudo - fields which vary adiabatically , or slowly , throughout the photonic graphene lattice .",
    "we develop an asymptotic theory which leads to explicit formulas for isolated curves in the dispersion relation describing how the structure of edge modes depends on a given pseudo - field @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we can theoretically predict for general pseudo - fields when unidirectional traveling waves exist and the speed with which they propagate .    to exemplify the different classes of dispersion relations allowed in our problem , we take the pseudo - magnetic field to be the following function ( `` lissajous '' curves ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are constant . below we will consider two cases in detail . in the first case we choose @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "this corresponds to the pseudo - field employed in @xcite , and in most parts of this paper . in this case",
    "the above function becomes a perfect circle given by @xmath44 where @xmath34 and @xmath36 are constant . in the second case",
    "we choose @xmath45 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath46 . in this case",
    "the above lissajous curve becomes a figure-8 curve given by @xmath47 where @xmath34 and @xmath36 are constant .",
    "for these classes of pseudo - fields , the numerically computed dispersion relations and the asymptotic prediction of the isolated curves agree very well .",
    "however the dispersion relations also exhibit sensitive behavior in which small gaps in the spectrum appear when the small parameter @xmath48 characterizing the slow evolution increases in size .",
    "further , we find that when edge modes exist there are two important cases .",
    "the first is the case where pure edge modes exist in the entire periodic interval .",
    "the second case is where quasi - edge modes persist only for part of the period .",
    "quasi - edge modes do not exist in the rapidly varying case studied in @xcite , and so we have shown adiabatic variation of the pseudo - field allows for new dynamics even at the linear level .",
    "we also present potential scaling regimes where these cases might be observed experimentally ; see section  [ sec : length - scale ] .",
    "we are also able to analyze the effect of nonlinearity on these slowly varying traveling edge modes .",
    "a nonconstant coefficient ( ` time'-dependent ) one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation governing the envelope of the edge modes is derived and is found to be an effective description of nonlinear traveling edge modes . in the rapidly varying case @xcite , the associated nls equation had constant coefficients , and so we see adiabatic variation introduces new dynamics into the nonlinear evolution of edge modes .",
    "using this new nls equation , in the focusing case , we find analytically , and confirm numerically , that unidirectionally propagating edge solitons are present in nonlinear photonic graphene lattices .",
    "computation of the nls equation is compared with direct simulation of the coupled discrete tight binding model with very good agreement obtained . as with the traditional , constant coefficient , focusing nls equation , nonlinearity balances dispersion to produce nonlinear edge solitons .",
    "depending on the choice of parameters , some of the nonlinear modes appear to be immune to backscattering and can propagate for long distances .",
    "we emphasize that these length scales are far beyond what might be expected from the scales defining the asymptotic theory . given this persistence",
    ", we argue that such cases are nonlinear analogues of topologically protected states in topological insulators .",
    "prior to the derivation of the ` time ' varying nls equation in this paper , and the constant coefficient version in @xcite , topological insulators have only been defined for linear systems .",
    "the results in this and previous papers show that nonlinear photonic graphene can also be thought of as a topological insulator .",
    "time - dependent nls equations also arise when dispersion varies along the propagation direction in an optical fiber @xcite , i.e. the case studied here would be an analogue of ` slow ' dispersion management . therefore , the results of this paper show that nonlinear , adiabatically varying photonic graphene lattices could provide useful new means for the control of light .",
    "this control results from the merging of nonlinear and symmetry - breaking effects . see also @xcite , where bulk nonlinear modes in photonic graphene have been found .",
    "further , the  topologically protected nonlinear states \" found here can potentially apply to other systems ,  recently introduced one dimensional domain walls @xcite .",
    "to begin the analysis , the substitution @xmath49 in @xmath50 gives @xmath51 the tight binding approximation for large @xmath52 assumes a bloch wave envelope of the form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the linearly independent orbitals associated with the two sites a and b where the honeycomb potential @xmath29 has minima in each fundamental cell , and @xmath56 is a vector in the brillouin zone .",

    "we further assume that the pseudo - field @xmath16 evolves adiabatically , i.e. we take @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "our goal is to find slowly evolving and decaying modes as @xmath87 .",
    "it is convenient to employ a multiple - scales ansatz @xmath88 where @xmath89 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : abn - ori - a]-[eq : abn - ori - b ] ) the basic perturbation equations are given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",

    "the frequency interval @xmath113 of pure edge modes then falls into one of the following three cases @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we note that since no pure edge mode exists for any range of frequencies @xmath80 in case ( iii ) , this case will be omitted in the following discussion of pure edge modes .",
    "next we note that associated with the edge solution ( [ envelope_eq]-[statsoln ] ) , the fredholm condition ( [ fredholm ] ) , derived in appendix  [ pert ] , implies that the envelope of the edge solution satisfies the equation @xmath117 where @xmath118 substituting ( [ statsoln ] ) into and manipulating terms , we find that @xmath119 as can be readily seen , this quantity is real , and thus since @xmath120 this term shows that the influence of the nontrivial pseudo - magnetic field @xmath16 on the nearly stationary edge modes is the introduction of a non - trivial phase .",
    "we know that the function @xmath121 is periodic in @xmath122 , and so we can write @xmath123 where the average term @xmath124 is given by @xmath125    therefore , to leading order , we have that the edge mode in the presence of a slowly varying pseudo - field @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 where the periodic function @xmath128 is given by @xmath129 since both @xmath128 and @xmath130 are periodic in @xmath122 , we see the floquet parameter for the periodic problem is given by @xmath124 , which then gives us the dispersion relation in the presence of a nontrivial pseudo - field @xmath16 . in general , one can not obtain floquet parameters in explicit form , though in this perturbative system we can do so .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath131 can be classified according to a @xmath132 topological index @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the number of roots of @xmath135  @xcite .",
    "it can be readily seen that @xmath136 in case ( i ) , or when @xmath137 . in case ( ii ) , when @xmath138 , @xmath131 has the asymptotic behavior for @xmath139 ( see appendix  [ app : alpha - asym ] ) @xmath140 where @xmath141 are positive constants , and @xmath142 are those times such that @xmath143 therefore the direction of blowup of @xmath131 as @xmath144 agrees with the sign of @xmath145 at @xmath146 .",
    "it follows that for a pseudo - field @xmath126 which is counterclockwise in the @xmath147-plane , @xmath131 goes from @xmath148 at @xmath149 to @xmath150 at @xmath151 , and vice - versa for a clockwise pseudo - field .",
    "thus for any pseudo - field @xmath126 that forms a simple closed curve in the @xmath147-plane , the topological index is always @xmath152 in case ( ii ) , and the sign of the overall group velocity depends only on the helicity of the pseudo - field .",
    "however , if the pseudo - field forms a self - intersecting closed curve , then @xmath124 may asymptote to @xmath148 or @xmath150 at both @xmath149 and @xmath153 , in which case the topological index is @xmath136 .    in the case",
    "where the topological index is nontrivial , i.e.  @xmath152 , the pure edge modes are expected to behave like topologically protected modes , i.e.  there are no backward propagating modes to inhibit the evolution .",
