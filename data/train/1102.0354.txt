    "peristalsis is a progressive wave of area contraction and expansion in a tube .",
    "transport due to the peristaltic motion of a tube is one of the main transport mechanisms in biological systems such as the esophagus , small intestine , ureter , and so forth @xcite .",
    "peristaltic transport is also found in the pumping of fluids , known as peristaltic pumps , which are employed in medical and food engineering fields @xcite .",
    "the study of peristaltic transport has a long history and was particularly motivated by the desire to understand the transport of fluids in the ureter .",
    "peristaltic transport in a stokes fluid was studied in the late 1960s @xcite and early 1970s @xcite . a study on the peristaltic transport of a micropolar fluid @xcite following this direction has also been reported .",
    "in contrast , there have been few studies on the transport of particles under a peristaltic condition such as single particles @xcite and dilute passive solid particles @xcite suspended in a newtonian fluid . moreover , to the best of our knowledge , the peristaltic transport of dense particles has never been studied ,",
    "even though such a situation is commonly observed in flows of red blood cells , in the peristaltic pumping of corrosive sand and solid foods , and so forth @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the peristaltic transport of dry and smooth granular particles , which is closely related to the transport of particles through a bottleneck @xcite , particularly the discharge of grains from a silo @xcite . through previous studies",
    "it has been established that there are three regimes depending on the linear size of the bottleneck , @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is sufficiently large , particles flow continuously @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the mass flow rate @xmath1 satisfies the beverloo law @xmath2 for an empirical value @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is @xmath5 and @xmath6 for two- and three - dimensional systems under gravity , respectively @xcite , and @xmath4 is @xmath7 for disks on a conveyor belt @xcite . with decreasing size of the bottleneck",
    ", the flow becomes intermittent owing to the formation and breakdown of an arch at the outlet @xcite , and finally the flow stops , i.e. , _ jamming _ occurs @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the term jamming used in this context is slightly different from that in the _ jamming transition _ of granular matter discussed in recent studies @xcite .",
    "indeed , the jamming transition can be observed even for smooth , i.e. , frictionless , granular particles , while the jamming of a granular flow at the bottleneck is due to the persistent arch formation by grains , which can be observed only for rough , or frictional , particles .",
    "what actually corresponds to the jamming transition in the discharge of grains appears to be the so - called dilute - to - dense transition @xcite , which is observed at a phase boundary between continuous and intermittent regimes .    in this paper , we report the results of our simulations on the flow rate of a peristaltic granular flow .",
    "we consider dry , smooth , monodisperse , and spherical particles in a three - dimensional sinusoidally oscillating tube .",

    "peristaltic motion is represented by the propagation of a spatially oscillating wall along the axial direction of a tube , which is described in detail in the following .",
    "the system involves @xmath13 monodisperse , smooth , and mobile granular spheres with diameter @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 in a peristaltic tube with length @xmath16 under a periodic boundary condition along the direction of propagation @xmath17 of peristaltic waves .",
    "the wall of the tube consists of @xmath18 embedded overlapping spheres .",

    "i.e. , mobile particles , the equation of motion is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the elastic and viscous contact forces acting on particle @xmath26 by particle @xmath27 .",
    "for their explicit forms , we adopt the following model : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a step function with @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 otherwise , @xmath33 denotes the spring constant , @xmath34 is the viscosity , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "( [ eq : equation of motion ] ) numerically using the euler method with a fixed time interval of @xmath39 for each step .",
    "as mentioned above , we ignore the mutual deformation of the wall .",

    "in contrast , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are set to form a nearly hexagonal lattice with lattice constant @xmath50 on the @xmath51-@xmath17 plane .",

    "we fix @xmath52 throughout this paper to prevent the transported particles from penetrating the tube wall , which means that @xmath53 , although we set @xmath54 in our simulations .",

    "note that we do not use the volume fraction @xmath67 but use @xmath68 instead .",

    "note , however , that such `` low '' inelasticity or dissipation is necessary to reach a steady state because the energy is input to the system continuously by the peristaltic motion .",

    "it is noteworthy that the terminology of  jammed \" and  unjammed \" flows is counter - intuitive , because a jammed flow has a larger flow rate than an unjammed flow .",
    "this can be understood easily by considering the process relative to a frame moving with the wall .",
    "indeed , the jammed state does not exhibit any motion in this frame , while the unjammed state has some mobile particles moving in the backward direction .",
    "namely , some particles left behind by the wall motion contribute to the negative flow rate in the unjammed phase .",
    "+      the flow rate is often defined @xcite as @xmath76 in studies employing molecular dynamics simulations and discrete element methods , where @xmath77 is the @xmath17-component of the dimensionless momentum of particle @xmath26 . in real experiments , however , the above definition may not be appropriate because it requires the momenta of all particles . instead",

    "we demonstrated that the flow rate is a suitable order parameter for this system and found that a dynamic phase transition from a slow  unjammed \" flow to a fast  jammed \" flow occurs at a critical width of the peristaltic tube .",
    "we also found that the transition times , its fluctuations , and the peak values of the second moments of the flow rate obey power laws as the minimum width approaches the critical value .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated the existence of scaling functions for these quantities .",
    "it was also shown that the critical width is almost independent of the density but depends linearly on peristaltic velocity .",
    "nevertheless , the phase transition is discontinuous and exhibits a hysteresis loop under some initial conditions .    to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "this is the first report demonstrating the existence of a phase transition in peristaltic transport . since the pioneering work on peristaltic transport carried out by shapiro _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , many works have reported how the flow rate depends on the amplitude ratio @xmath178 for various fluids .",
    "in contrast , our work reveals that the flow rate of a granular flow exhibits a finite jump at @xmath179 . to describe this behavior using a fluid model",
    ", the authors suggest that at least compressibility and the local fluid - solid phase transition have to be introduced into the model .",
    "we expect that our finding will be confirmed by experiments in the near future .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , an analogous phase transition exists in a granular flow through a small bottleneck , which is called the dilute - to - dense transition @xcite .",
    "recently zhong _ et al . _",
    "reported @xcite that the characteristic time @xmath109 satisfies @xmath180 with @xmath181 in a two - dimensional granular flow through a bottleneck .",
    "their exponent is , of course , much larger than ours of @xmath116 .",
    "there is no reason why the same exponent should be obtained in different systems with different dimensions , but we expect that there is a universal law that explains such dynamical phase transitions .    in this paper , we ignored many aspects of realistic granular particles such as the static friction among contact grains , the polydispersity of grain size , particle shape , and the effects of adhesive forces and interstitial fluids . moreover , we stress that the strain - control protocol used in this paper is unrealistic and that a stress - control protocol should be used for a realistic analysis of the peristaltic transport of grains . in this sense ,",
    "our paper is only the first step to demonstrating the possible existence of an interesting dynamic phase transition for the peristaltic transport of granular particles , which might have occurred as a result of the oversimplified model that we used .",
