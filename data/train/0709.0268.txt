    "accurate estimations of exchange interactions among semiconductor defects are crucial in determining the magnetic properties of doped semiconductors near to a metal - insulator transition @xcite and in assessing the potential of such defects for potential applications in quantum information processing @xcite",
    ". however , the long - range tails of defect wavefunctions make it difficult or impossible to treat these systems using fully _ ab initio _ techniques , so such calculations are generally performed within empirical models such as the well - established effective mass approximation @xcite .",
    "the quantum - mechanical problem for a single defect is thereby reduced to that of a single electron moving in an effective medium determined by the effective mass and static permittivity of the host crystal ; in the simplest form of the theory , the solution becomes that of a scaled hydrogen atom .",
    "the exchange between two such defects can then be obtained from well - established treatments of exchange in the hydrogen molecule , ranging from the simple heitler - london model @xcite to the more sophisticated approach of herring and flicker @xcite which exactly accounts for the two - electron correlations in the limit of large separations .",
    "however , a number of complications arise when considering real defect systems .",
    "first , the minima of the conduction band may not be isotropic ; this is so in the important case of silicon , where there are six degenerate minima lying along the @xmath0 directions in the brillouin zone and each having a significant anisotropy ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 is electron mass .",
    "this is commonly dealt with either by simply adopting an effective isotropic dispersion with an appropriate average effective mass ( for example , @xmath4 ) , or by making a variational _ ansatz _ for the wavefunction of the anisotropic system , such as that of luttinger and kohn @xcite .",
    "second , the existence of more than one minimum needs to be accounted for ; this results in an effective - mass wavefunction of the form @xmath5 where the sum runs over the different minima , @xmath6 is a slowly - varying envelope function , and @xmath7 is the bloch function for the @xmath8th minimum .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 arise from the coupling of the different band minima by short - range ( large - wavevector ) components of the potential ; for an isolated substitutional donor in a perfect crystal , they correspond to an irreducible representation of the @xmath10 point group . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the ground state of defects in silicon , for which the terms in equation  ( [ eq : multibandeffmass ] ) correspond to the six @xmath0 directions and the appropriate representation is the identity representation : @xmath11    the existence of these distinct parts to the wavefunction gives rise to interference terms in properties of defect pairs as a function of their separation .",
    "such terms were originally considered in electron hopping and recombination rates @xcite , and later included in exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "other more recent calculations are discussed below .",
    "note , however , that the expressions used in @xcite to average the exchange over the different minima assume a particular physical origin for the exchange ( namely the direct electron - electron coulomb interaction term ) which does not , in fact , dominate the problem . although its magnitude has approximately the same asymptotic scaling as the full exchange , by itself the direct term would lead to a ferromagnetic spin - spin interaction .",
    "the observed interaction is always antiferromagnetic , as it must be for a two - electron system @xcite ) .",
    "both the anisotropy and multiple - minima problems can be solved while remaining largely or entirely within the framework of effective - mass theory , and a number of recent papers have addressed the exchange between hydrogenic donors by this method . much of the inspiration for this work came from the proposal @xcite to use such exchange in shallow donors as a qubit - qubit coupling mechanism to drive entangling gates in quantum information processing .",
    "the importance of precise donor positioning in determining the value of the exchange was emphasized in @xcite , but this paper follows @xcite in using only the ( ferromagnetic ) direct exchange interaction for the calculations .",
    "the full heitler - london formula for the exchange was used in a following paper @xcite , where the contribution of strain to modifying the interaction was also discussed .",
    "these calculations were performed by neglecting the spatial variation of the periodic part of the bloch functions @xmath12 appearing in equation  ( [ eq : multibandeffmass ] ) ; this approximation was carefully examined in @xcite and found to be very accurate , and this finding was confirmed by a subsequent calculation of the electronic structure of defect pairs in which the bloch functions from an _ ab initio _ treatment of the host crystal were used @xcite .",
    "the same paper also found that allowing the phases of the different bloch function contributions to ` float ' relative to one another in the case of the defect pair made small difference to the results .",
    "the third difficulty is in many ways most serious : effective - mass theory predicts that all single - electron donors in a given host should have the same binding energy , independent of their chemical nature .",
    "this is far from the case : in silicon , for example , observed binding energies range from 31.2mev for li and 45.6mev for p through to 71.0mev for bi @xcite , whereas the calculated value using the luttinger - kohn variant of effective mass theory is 31.3mev @xcite .",
    "it is very desirable to predict exchange in deeper donors by similarly simple methods : they are advantageous for quantum information processing @xcite because they are less prone to ionization , and have much longer spin - lattice relaxation lifetimes @xcite  indeed , resonant raman routes for spin relaxation are completely absent if the level spacing exceeds the maximum phonon energy of the host material ( 64.5mev for si ) .    treating deep donors",
    "requires some significant corrections to effective mass theory .",
    "two common approaches involve making an explicit short - range correction to the coulomb field of the impurity ( the so - called ` central cell correction ' ) , or altering the long - range solution in the coulomb field so that it corresponds to the observed binding energy ( the ` quantum defect ' approach , which has its origins in atomic physics ) @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of these modifications on the exchange interactions of the defects has remained largely unknown .    in this paper",
    "we show how the exchange in the most physically relevant range of separations can be computed between donors with arbitrary binding energies ( including the important case of deep donors ) .",
    "we use a quantum - defect description , with a simple model potential to represent the central - cell correction ; for reasons that are explained below , it is important to compute the exchange using a potential for which the wavefunction concerned is an eigenfunction .",
    "we first introduce the techniques that we use : the effective - mass model , quantum - defect corrections to it and the simple central - cell corrections , followed by the methods we use to calculate exchange .",
    "then we present our results for defects of different binding energies .",
    "the effective - mass equation @xcite reads : @xmath13f_n=\\epsilon f_n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it is intended that the band energy @xmath14 be expanded around the band extremum @xmath15 to second order - terms in @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath6 is the envelope function , in terms of which the true wavefunction is expanded using @xmath17 where @xmath6 is a solution of the effective mass equation .    in the simplest theory ,",
    "the effective mass tensor is replaced by a single averaged effective mass @xmath18 , resulting in an effective isotropic equation for the envelope function , which is then independent of the index @xmath8 : @xmath19f(\\vec{r})=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the relative permittivity of the host . in this paper",
    "we will follow other recent treatments ( for example @xcite ) and work with this isotropic equation as our starting point . for silicon , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; this leads to a set of scaled atomic units for the hydrogenic impurity problem ( length @xmath23 , energy @xmath24 ) .",
    "the first component of our correction to effective - mass theory involves treating the wavefunction far from the impurity by the quantum defect method @xcite . even in the simplest isotropic approximation ,",
    "the method was found to provide quantitative results giving good approximations to both the observed spectral dependence and magnitude of the photo - ionization cross section @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of the quantum defect method is that good approximate wave functions valid in the region outside the impurity ion core can be determined using only a knowledge of the energy eigenvalues . rather than attempting to solve it as an eigenvalue equation to determine the allowed spectrum of @xmath25 , equation  ( [ eq : effmasseqn ] )",
    "is considered valid for large @xmath26 only and solved for the asymptotic form of the envelope functions @xmath27 corresponding to the _ empirical _ value of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the method can deduce the long - range part of the donor wave functions associated with the observed energy levels , whether deep or shallow , provided that the dominant corrections to effective - mass theory are short - range ( operate only near the defect ) .",
    "of the several different terms believed to contribute to the shift in binding energy for deep donors ( see , for example , @xcite ) , only the electron - phonon interaction operates far from the defect and its contribution is believed to be small .",
    "the most useful form of the far - field solution is a multiple of the well - known whittaker function which is just a particular linear combination of two standard linearly independent confluent hypergeometric functions , the combination being determined by the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "we consider the auxiliary radial function defined by @xmath28 , and write @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a whittaker function @xcite , @xmath31 is a normalization constant , and @xmath32 is the quantum defect parameter defined by @xmath33 if and only if the donor is hydrogenic ( i.e. shallow ) , @xmath32 is an integer",
    ".      for non - integer values of @xmath32 , the radial function associated with the solution  ( [ eq : whittaker ] ) diverges like @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "( nevertheless this divergence is integrable , so the functions have a well - defined normalization for all @xmath32 @xcite . ) in order to find a solution to equation  ( [ eq : effmasseqn ] ) that remains finite at the origin for a general given energy @xmath25 , we have to correct the potential at short distances .",
    "one way to do this is to look for corrections based on the local physics of the impurity ( for example incorporating correctly the transition from a screened to an unscreened nuclear potential @xcite , or including self - consistently the scattering effects of the impurity by means of a pseudoptential based on the microscopic physics @xcite ) ; another way is to correct the potential at small @xmath26 empirically solely in order to make the solution regular there at the experimentally observed energy eigenvalue . in this second case",
    "the potential will _ not _ correspond to the physics operating in the core region of the real defect , but it will produce the correct shift in binding energy . we adopt the second approach in this paper , and refer to the empirical correction as a model central - cell correction .",
    "we should expect that the two approaches would give similar results for the calculation of exchange interactions , since they are determined predominantly by the long - range behaviour of the wavefunction .",
    "we can then write the hamiltonian of a single defect center @xmath36 as @xmath37 where the third term on the right hand side is model central cell correction , which is not unique . in this work we used two forms for @xmath38 : a @xmath39-function shell or a square - well potential .",
    "let us choose @xmath38 to be a potential `` shell '' at radius @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is very small ( @xmath42 in scaled atomic units ) : @xmath43 in the following discussion , we will only consider s - symmetry wave functions because they are the donor ground states . after matching the large-@xmath26 solution to a solution valid for small @xmath26 that is regular at the origin and obeys the cusp condition for a nucleus of charge @xmath44 ( @xmath45 )",
    ", we find the solution is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the long - range solution for s - states defined by equation  ( [ eq : whittaker ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ pic : whitkccsq ] ) shows the wave function for deep and shallow donors , both with the central cell correction and without it .",
    "note how the diverging tails of the whittaker function are cut off for @xmath48 .",
    "an alternative matching is to replace the coulomb potential by a square well , of depth @xmath49 , for @xmath48 : @xmath50 this model correction gives us :    * @xmath51 @xmath52 * @xmath53 @xmath54    in figure ( [ pic : whitkccsq ] ) we compare the wave functions for both deep and shallow donors , with both @xmath39-function square - well potential central cell corrections , and without any central - cell correction .",
    "note that in both cases the diverging tails of the wave function are cut off for @xmath48 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]      having calculated @xmath55 , we include the inter - valley effects by using equation  ( [ eqn : wex ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the exchange between typical deep donors ( @xmath56 ) , shallow donors ( @xmath57 ) , and super - shallow donors ( @xmath58 ) in silicon in the case where the donor pair is along a @xmath59 direction from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and both donors are in the ground state ( @xmath62 symmetry , so equation  ( [ eqn : a0toa5 ] ) applies ) .",
    "we see the exchange interactions still decay exponentially over the whole range , but this decay is mixed with oscillations due to the inter - valley terms as shown in figure  ( [ pic : pic3fortalk ] ) .",
    "the solid points in the figure denote the distances corresponding to the cubic lattice constant in si ( i.e. , the actual separations of substitutional sites along @xmath63 $ ] ) .",

    "( the lower limit plotted corresponds approximately to the values of @xmath67 where dipolar interactions begin to dominate over exchange . )",
    "all the distributions are extremely broad ( as would be expected from the exponential scaling of the exchange with separation ) but the strong dependence on the type of donor is evident .",
    "this distribution is important for the choice of donor concentration in samples for applications in quantum information processing ; for example , in the scheme proposed in @xcite the density should ideally be sufficiently low that typical exchange interactions between neighbours produce a small evolution of the system on the timescales of gate operation . for deep donors with @xmath56 , typical nearest - neighbour interactions at the lower density",

    "we have shown that a combination of quantum - defect theory ( where whittaker functions are used to describe simply the long - range part of donor wavefunctions ) with model central - cell corrections can be used to describe the electronic structure of donors in semiconductors having binding energies significantly different from the ideal hydrogenic effective - mass value , including in particular the important case of deep donors . from these wavefunctions",
    "we have shown that it is possible to calculate the exchange interactions between donors , both in the single envelope - function approximation and by including the interference effects between contributions from different conduction - band minima .",
    "these interference effects typically cause the exchange to fluctuate by approximately one order of magnitude between the separations of successive substitutional sites , in agreement with previous calculations for shallow donors .    from the comparison between the exchange calculations performed with and without different central cell corrections",
    ", we can see that as expected the correct long - range behaviour of the wavefunction is more important than the form near the nucleus , except when the inter - donor distance becomes very small  however , the heitler - london like approach we use for exchange is not expected to be accurate at short range . at long range ,",
    "the central - cell corrections have only small effects on the exchange , although these may be enhanced by the interference of inter - valley terms . however , the inclusion of central - cell corrections is important to obtain consistent results for the exchange between the exact heitler - london approach ( equation  ( [ eq : basicformulahl ] ) ) and the frequently - used simplification given by equation  ( [ eq : heitlerlondon ] ) .",
    "our calculations rely on a gaussian fit to the true form of the radial function , which is least accurate very near the nucleus and at large distances . at large donor separations",

    "@xmath73 , much less than the donor separations @xmath74 that we consider , so we expect this error to be negligible . the long - range error in the fit is important only at very large donor separations where the spin - spin interaction is no longer exchange - dominated .",
