    "evaporation and condensation has been well studied , and many theories exist for this important phenomenon .",
    "the theories are mostly rate theories .",
    "kinetic theory has long played a central role @xcite . with information about the condensation coefficient in this theory ,",
    "the mass and heat fluxes are determined . recently",
    "nagayama and tsuruta @xcite have given a derivation of the condensation coefficient using transition state theory @xcite .",
    "they based their theory on molecular dynamics simulations of condensing particles @xcite , giving that the probability of a particle to condense increases with an increasing normal component of the velocity of the particle to the interface .",
    "common to rate theories @xcite is that the driving forces of transport do not appear explicitly in the expression for the rate .",
    "nonequilibrium thermodynamics gives , on the other hand , two independent forces for the case of condensation or evaporation of a one - component system .",
    "these are the chemical potential difference at constant temperature , and the difference in inverse temperature @xcite . in the nonequilibrium thermodynamic description of phase transition , the heat and mass fluxes are linear in these forces .",
    "rubi and coworkers @xcite developed mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics , following and generalizing the work described in de groot and mazur @xcite .",
    "this method , which describes the system on the mesoscopic level , can give a more detailed thermodynamic foundation for rate processes .",
    "this is done by including more variables than are normal in a nonequilibrium thermodynamic description , for instance the velocity of the particles , an important variable in rate theories . by integrating the flux equations , which are now linear in the forces on the mesoscopic level ,",
    "nonlinear flux - force relations are obtained .",
    "rate theories and nonequilibrium thermodynamics aim to describe the same phenomenon .",
    "it is therefore important to know the strength and weaknesses of the theories , and under which conditions they become equivalent .",
    "it is the main aim of this article to develop and apply mesocopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics to evaporation and condensation . by developing the theory for this case",
    ", we hope to strengthen the thermodynamic basis for this important phenomenon .",
    "we shall present a detailed mesoscopic formulation , starting with the macroscopic one , in order to define proper boundary conditions . as new variables",
    "we introduce the condensation coordinate , called the reaction coordinate by nagayama and tsuruta , and the normal velocity of the particles as internal variables . by doing this",
    "we shall see that the earlier description using nonequilibrium thermodynamics for interfaces @xcite can be related to a richer , more detailed formulation .",
    "the new level of description is also easier to compare to kinetic theory .",
    "this theory will appear then as a special case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the nonequilibrium theory for the mesoscopic level",
    "is developed in section 2 .",
    "we shall use the terminology used in de groot and mazur @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions are given for the fluxes along the internal coordinates .",
    "the result of the section is a new expression for the excess entropy production rate . in the 3rd section the description",
    "is restricted to stationary evaporation and condensation .",
    "this simplifies the expression for the excess entropy production rate considerably .",
    "the resulting flux equations are next given in section 4 . for large enough times one may neglect inertial effects due to acceleration of particles .",
    "this leads to a simplified expression for the flux along the condensation coordinate . leaving the effects of the thermal force to future work",
    ", we then proceed to neglect temperature differences across the interface . integrating the resulting expression for the flux along the condensation coordinate over the internal variables ,",
    "an expression is found for the condensation flux across the interface in the isothermal case .",
    "our result for the condensation flux is discussed and compared to the corresponding ones found using simple kinetic theory and in the work by nagayama and tsuruta @xcite , in section 5 .",
    "they are found to reproduce the results of both these cases . in the final section",
    "some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the system consists of a vapour in the presence of its liquid in a container of volume @xmath0 .",
    "the interface is planar . on a macroscopic scale (",
    "say in @xmath1 m ) , the vapor is located in the region with @xmath2 , while the liquid is located in the region with @xmath3 , see fig.1a .",
    "the interface appears as a discontinuity on this scale , but with excesses in entropy , internal energy , and mass .",
    "this formulation is due to gibbs @xcite . in the absence of global equilibrium",
    ", there are gradients in temperature , @xmath4 , and density , @xmath5 , in the homogeneous liquid and vapour phases . across the interface",
    ", there is also a local variation in the same quantities , as well as in the velocity distributions of the particles .",
    "this variation is , as nagayama and tsuruta @xcite have shown , important for condensation .",
    "the expression for the excess entropy production rate of the interface , in the presence of a temperature difference and a difference in chemical potential was given by bedeaux and kjelstrup @xcite .",
    "for a one - component system we have : @xmath6 + j_{q}^{\\prime , l}\\left [ \\frac{1}{t^{l}}-\\frac{1}{t^{s}}\\right ]    \\notag \\\\ & -j^{g}\\left [ \\frac{\\mu ^{s}-\\mu ^{g}\\left ( t^{s}\\right ) } { t^{s}}\\right ] -j^{l}\\left [ \\frac{\\mu ^{l}\\left ( t^{s}\\right ) -\\mu ^{s}}{t^{s}}\\right ]   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the flux of heat from the vapour into the interface is @xmath7 , while the one from the interface into the liquid is @xmath8",
    ". the corresponding mass fluxes are @xmath9 and @xmath10 . when the independent fluxes are the measurable heat fluxes and the mass fluxes on the vapor and the liquid sides , the conjugate forces are the differences in inverse temperatures ( from the interface to the vapour , and from the liquid to the interface ) and the same differences for the chemical potentials at the temperature of the interface divided by the temperature of the interface . the superscripts @xmath11  and @xmath12  indicate values in the vapor , at the interface and in the liquid , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential in the interface is @xmath13 .",
    "when we write @xmath14 it means that the chemical potential of the gas is taken at the temperature of the interface .",
    "when the chemical potential of the gas is taken at the temperature of the gas this is not separately indicated , thus @xmath15 .",
    "the frame of reference for the fluxes is the interface . for simplicity we do not consider fluxes along the interface in this paper",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a mesoscopic description of the process , in terms of internal variables characterising the transition states of the system , able to derive the kinetic law for the rate of condensation .",
    "we shall replace the third and the fourth terms in eq.([1 ] ) by a more detailed expression derived using two internal variables .",
    "the choice for internal variables is motivated by the work of nagayama and tsuruta @xcite .",
    "we know from their work that the potential energy of condensing particles has a maximum in the interfacial region and that the velocity component normal to the interface is important for the likelihood of condensation .",
    "it is also known that the energy flux across the interface has maximum contribution from potential energy in the interface @xcite . in order to describe this",
    ", we introduce a coordinate @xmath16 for the degree of condensation .",
    "this coordinate is similar to the degree of reaction in transition state theory for chemical reactions @xcite . by introducing the degree of condensation as a variable ,",
    "one enlarges the space of the interface into an internal space , ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.1b .",
    "in other words , we expand the interface in this coordinate ( at @xmath19 . in the process",
    ", we must make sure that the boundary conditions are correct .    in fig.[fig:1]a",
    "the chemical potential has a separate value in the interface .",
    "the problem is to find the chemical potential in the interface as a continuous function of the internal coordinate , i.e. to find the function @xmath20 .",
    "we need boundary conditions for the chemical potential that are compatible with eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "the boundaries for the chemical potential @xmath21 in the @xmath16-space are naturally : @xmath22 additionally , the flux along the condensation coordinate , @xmath23 , must obey @xmath24    we shall also use as internal coordinate , the component of the velocity normal to the interface , @xmath25 which varies from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . the chemical potential will then be a function of both @xmath28 and @xmath25 .",
    "the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 will be given in the next section .",
    "the flux along the internal coordinate @xmath31 , @xmath32 , is more commonly known as the acceleration of the particles .",
    "it satisfies the following boundary condition : @xmath33 we furthermore have @xmath34 this means that the value of @xmath35  integrated over all velocities of the condensation coordinate is equal to the mass flux from the vapor into the interface .",
    "there is no contribution to the mass flux at infinitely high or low velocities at any coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "the variation in the excess entropy of the interface , @xmath36 , in this mesoscopic description is given by @xmath37 the excess entropy of the interface is a function of the excess internal energy of the interface , @xmath38 , and the probability , @xmath39 to find a mole of particles in the interfacial area with the internal variables @xmath28  and v , see @xcite .",
    "as the equation shows , the derivatives of the entropy with respect to these variables are the inverse interface temperature , @xmath40 , and the chemical potential , @xmath41 , divided by the interface temperature , @xmath42 . in the general case , with @xmath43 , there is a probability for the particle to have a particular velocity .",
    "the velocity dependence is integrated out : @xmath44 to give the probability distribution @xmath45 .",
    "this distribution can be interpreted as the probability to find a mole of particles in the interfacial layer in fig.1b with the internal variable @xmath28 ( in mol / m@xmath46 ) .    according to gibbs entropy postulate @xcite , we can write that @xmath47 the potential function @xmath48 , which depends on @xmath16  and @xmath25 , may also depend on @xmath42 . in equilibrium",
    "the entropy has a maximum for a given value of the temperature and it follows from eq.([2 ] ) , that the chemical potential is constant .",
    "we shall use the constant @xmath49 the first term to the right , @xmath50 , is the chemical potential of the saturated vapor , considered as the standard state .",
    "this chemical potential is independent of @xmath16  and @xmath25 .",
    "the last term is minus two times the translational potential energy of one mole ideal gas .",
    "alternatively , we can use the gibbs postulate for the description where the velocity coordinate has been integrated out .",
    "we then have @xmath51 in equilibrium , we have @xmath52 the second contribution is half the value of that in eq.([8eq ] ) .",
    "the relation between the two expressions for the chemical potentials , eqs.([8eq ] ) and ( [ 8b ] ) , is found after determining the values of the functions @xmath48 and @xmath53 , see eq.([5e ] ) below . those values @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath54 will be obtained from the probability distributions at equilibrium between liquid and vapour .",
    "consider first the determination of @xmath48 .",
    "the probability varies with the kinetic energy of the particle which for a mole of particles , is given by @xmath55 .",
    "we shall further assume that the particles are crossing a potential energy barrier along the condensation coordinate , @xmath56 .",
    "the barrier is zero at the ends of the condensation coordinate , @xmath57 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the probability distribution is then given by : @xmath58   \\label{9}\\ ] ] by substituting this equation and eq.([8eq ] ) into eq.([8 ] ) , we find @xmath59 the function @xmath60 is illustrated in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "this part of the chemical potential has a small maximum along the @xmath28-axis .",
    "particles at the left of the barrier having higher velocities ( and consequently higher values of @xmath61 ) can easily cross the barrier in @xmath28-space going through decreasing values of the velocity coordinate .",
    "this shows that the velocity distribution of the particles plays an important role in condensation kinetics @xcite .    on the other hand ,",

    "this can be seen by first substituting @xmath64  and @xmath65 , as obtained from eqs.([8 ] ) and ( [ 8b ] ) , into eq.([5c ] ) .",
    "the following identity is obtained : @xmath66 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\mathrm{v}\\text { } \\exp\\left [ \\frac{\\mu ^{s}(\\gamma,\\mathrm{v})-c^{s}\\left ( \\gamma,\\mathrm{v}\\right ) } { rt^{s}}\\right ]   \\label{5d}\\ ] ] dividing both sides by exp@xmath67,$ ] and using eqs.([10 ] ) and ( [ 10b ] ) , this can be written as @xmath68 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } d\\mathrm{v}\\text { } \\exp\\left [ \\frac{\\mu^{s}(\\gamma,\\mathrm{v})-\\frac{1 } { 2}m\\mathrm{v}^{2}}{rt^{s}}\\right ]    \\label{5e}\\ ] ] substitution of eqs.([8eq ] ) and ( [ 8beq ] ) into this equation gives an identity .",

    "we have given above two sets of chemical potential and corresponding probability distribution . in the most general case ,",
    "the chemical potential is a continuous function of @xmath71 . in the other case",
    "it is a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath73 was given by integrating the most general probability distribution function over @xmath25-space .",
    "an important consequence of the change in variables , is that the chemical potential in the state of equilibrium changes . as the number of internal variables increases the equilibrium state changes to lower values .",
    "with one internal variable , the chemical potential is lowered by half the kinetic energy of an ideal gas , with two internal variables it is lowered by twice this value .",
    "we can now follow the normal procedure and find the entropy production rate in the variable space we are interested in .",
    "the procedure consists of combining the time rate of change of gibbs equation with the balance equations . in the present case ,",
    "there are three independent balance equations",
