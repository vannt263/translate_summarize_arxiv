    "our paper emerges from the the fact that today s submicron semiconductor devices are operated under high frequencies and strong electric fields .",
    "information transmission using electromagnetic waves at very high frequencies will have a direct impact on how we design active and passive components in different fields of micro- and optoelectronics .",
    "in such cases , quasi - static semiconductor device models like the energy - balance model ( ebm ) are no longer adequate . especially in gaas and related materials used for high - speed device design ,",
    "inertia effects play an important role since the impulse and energy relaxation times of the electron gas are close to the picosecond range .",
    "the most elaborate and practicable approach for the description of charge transport in semiconductors used for device simulation would be the monte carlo ( mc ) method @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this technique is a complete picture of carrier dynamics with reference to microscopic material parameters , e.g. effective masses and scattering parameters .",
    "but the method must be still considered as very time consuming and hence not economical to be used by device designers .",
    "besides the simplest concept which is the traditional drift - diffusion model ( ddm ) , there is a much more rigorous approach to the problem , namely the so - called hydrodynamic model ( hdm ) .",
    "this model makes use of electron temperature ( or energy density ) as additional quantities for the description of charge transport . starting from the boltzmann equation , blotekjaer @xcite and many others presented a derivation of such equations for the first time .",
    "the physical parameters used in the hdm can be obtained from theoretical considerations or mc simulations .",
    "a simplified version of the hdm is the so - called energy - balance model ( ebm ) .    in the first part of this work",
    ", we give a short definition of the charge transport models .",
    "we will illustrate how the different models and their parameters can be related to each other . in a second part",
    ", we give a simple discretization scheme for the full hydrodynamic model . in the last part ,",
    "we compare the different models for the case of a submicron silicon ballistic diode ( an @xmath0 structure ) and a gallium arsenide ballistic diode .",
    "since we will illustrate the hdm for the case of an n - doped ballistic diode where the contribution of electron holes to the current transport is negligible , we will only discuss the charge transport models for electrons .",
    "generalization of the models to the case where both charge carriers are present is straightforward .    the four hydrodynamic equations for parabolic energy bands are    @xmath1    @xmath2    @xmath3    @xmath4    and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron density , @xmath7 the drift velocity of the electron gas , @xmath8 the elemental charge , @xmath9 the electric field , @xmath10 the quasi - static electric potential , t the electron gas temperature , @xmath11 the electron energy density , @xmath12 the thermal conductivity , @xmath13 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath14 is the density of donors .",
    "the particle current density @xmath15 is related to the current density @xmath16 by the simple formula @xmath17 .",
    "( [ cont ] ) is simply the continuity equation which expresses particle number conservation .",
    "( [ ib ] ) is the so - called impulse balance equation , eq .",
    "( [ eb ] ) the energy balance equation and eq .",
    "( [ poi ] ) the well - known poisson equation .",
    "we will solve the hydrodynamic equations for @xmath18 and @xmath10 . to close the set of equations , we relate the electron energy density to the thermal and kinetic energy of the electrons by assuming parabolic energy bands @xmath19 in fact",
    ", we already assumed implicitly parabolic bands for the impulse balance equation , which is usually given in the form @xmath20 i.e. we replaced the electron impulse density by the particle current density by assuming @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a _ constant _ effective electron mass .",
    "the impulse relaxation time @xmath23 describes the impulse loss of the electron gas due to the interaction with the crystal , the energy relaxation time @xmath24 the energy transfer between the electron gas with temperature @xmath25 and the crystal lattice with temperature @xmath26 . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are usually modelled as a function of the total doping density @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density of acceptors , the lattice temperature @xmath26 , the electron temperature @xmath25 or alternatively the mean energy per electron @xmath29 .    a simplification of the full hdm is the energy - balance model . in the ebm ,",
    "the convective terms of the impulse balance equation are skipped .",
    "the energy balance equation is simplified by the assumption that the time derivative of the mean electron energy @xmath30 is small compared to the other terms and that the kinetic part in @xmath11 can also be neglected , i.e. @xmath31 this non - degenerate approximation which avoids a description by fermi integrals is justified for the low electron densities in the relevant region of the simulation examples , where velocity overshoot can be observed .",
    "the energy balance equation then becomes @xmath32 @xmath33 and the impulse balance equation becomes the current equation @xmath34 continuity equation and poisson equation are of course still valid in the ebm . neglecting the time derivative of the current density is equivalent to the assumption that the electron momentum is able to adjust itself to a change in the electric field within a very short time .",
    "while this assumption is justified for relatively long - gated field effect transistors , it needs to be investigated for short - gate cases .    a further simplification of the ebm leads to the drift - diffusion model .",
    "the energy balance equation is completely removed from the set of equations , therefore it is no longer possible to include the electron temperature @xmath25 in the current equation .",
    "@xmath25 is simply replaced by the lattice temperature @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the ddm consists of the continuity equation , the poisson equation and the current equation @xmath35 and it is assumed that the electron mobility is a function of the electric field .",
    "but at least , the electron temperature is taken into account in an implicit way : if one considers the stationary and homogeneous case in the hdm , where spatial and temporal derivatives can be neglected , one has for the current equation @xmath36 or @xmath37 and the energy balance equation becomes simply @xmath38 combining eq .",
    "( [ hom1 ] ) and ( [ hom2 ] ) leads to the relation @xmath39 in our simulations for silicon , we will use the baccarani - wordemann model , which defines the relaxation times by @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 is the saturation velocity , i.e. the drift velocity of the electron gas at high electric fields .",
    "@xmath43 is the low field mobility , which depends mainly on the lattice temperature and the total doping density .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we mention that inserting the expressions for the relaxation times into eqs .",
    "( [ hom1 ] ) and ( [ hom2 ] ) leads to the @xmath44-relation @xmath45\\ ] ] and the electron mobility @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 this is the well - known caughey - thomas mobility model @xcite .",
    "it has the important property that @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "the ebm has the big advantage that it includes the electron temperature @xmath25 , such that the electron temperature gradient can be included in the current equation , and the mobility can be modelled more accurately as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "an expression is needed for the thermal conductivity of the electron gas , which stems from theoretical considerations @xmath52 several different choices for r can be found in the literature , and many authors @xcite even neglect heat conduction in their models . but baccarani and wordeman point out in @xcite that neglecting this term can lead to nonphysical results and mathematical instability . although their work is directed to si , their remarks should be equally valid for gaas since the equations have the same form in both cases .",
    "we will present a gaas mesfet simulation comparable to the one of ghazaly _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in a forthcoming paper , but with heat conduction included .",
    "the best value for @xmath53 appears to be @xmath54 for silicon at 300 k , according to comparisons of hydrodynamic and mc simulations of the ballistic diode @xcite .",
    "today , many elaborate discretization methods are available for the ddm equations or ebm equations .",
    "the well - known scharfetter - gummel method @xcite for the ddm makes use of the fact that the current density is a slowly varying quantity .",
    "the current equation is then solved exactly under the assumption of a constant current density over a discretization cell , which leads to an improved expression for the current density than it is given by simple central differences .",
    "it is therefore possible to implement physical arguments into the discretization method .",
    "similar techniques have been worked out for the ebm @xcite .",
    "but due to the complexity of the hdm equations , no satisfactory discretization methods which include physical input are available for this case . for the one dimensional case ,",
    "this is not a very big disadvantage , since the accuracy of the calculations can be improved by choosing a finer grid , without rising very strongly the computation time .",
    "therefore , we developed a shock - capturing upwind discretization method , which has the advantage of being simple and reliable . for our purposes , it was sufficient to use a homogeneous mesh and a constant time step .",
    "but the method can be generalized without any problems to the non - homogeneous case .",
    "also a generalization to two dimensions causes no problems , and we are currently studying two dimensional simulations of gaas mesfets .    the fact that the discretization scheme is fully explicit should not mislead to the presumption that it is of a trivial kind .",
    "in fact , stabilizing a fully explicit discretization scheme for such a highly non - linear system of differential equations like the hdm is a difficult task , and a slight change in the discretization strategy may cause instabilities . therefore ,",
    "naive application of the upwind method does not lead to the desired result .",
    "the order how the different quantities are updated is also of crucial importance for the maximal timesteps that are allowed .",
    "the timesteps can be enhanced by using an implicit scheme , but only at the cost of an increased amount of computations needed for the iterative numerical solution of the implicit nonlinear equations .",
    "the device of length @xmath55 is decomposed into @xmath56 cells @xmath57 of equal length @xmath58 .",
    "scalar quantities like the electron density @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the potential @xmath61 and the electron energy density @xmath62 are thought to be located at the center of the cells , whereas vectorial quantities like the particle current @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the electric field @xmath65 are located at the boundaries of the cells . if necessary",
    ", we can define e.g. @xmath66 by @xmath67 but a different definition will apply to e.g. @xmath68 , as we shall see .    the fundamental variables that we will have to compute at each timestep are @xmath59 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( or @xmath69 ) for @xmath70 , and @xmath63 for @xmath71 , if @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are fixed by boundary conditions .",
    "all other variables used in the sequel should be considered as derived quantities .",
    "the constant timestep @xmath78 used in our simulations was typically of the order of a few tenths of a femtosecond , and quantities at time @xmath79 carry an upper integer index @xmath80 .",
    "having calculated @xmath81 for a timestep @xmath80 , we define the electron density at the midpoint by @xmath82 i.e the electron density is extrapolated from neighbouring points in the direction of the electron flow , and further @xmath83 the upwind extrapolation of the electron density which is given by the weighting factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 is improving the accuracy of the scheme compared to the usual upwind choice @xmath86 , where simply the neighbouring value in upwind direction is used .",
    "analogously we define @xmath87 and @xmath88    the discretization of the poisson equation can be done by central differences .",
    "the continuity equation is discretized as follows : @xmath89 and thus @xmath90 can be calculated from quantities at @xmath79 .",
    "[ cons ] defines a conservative discretization , since the total number of electrons can only be changed at the boundaries , where electrons may enter or leave the device .",
    "electrons inside the device which leave cell @xmath57 at its right boundary enter cell @xmath91 from the left .",
    "the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 will not be needed in our simulations , since we will use boundary conditions for the electron density which fix @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    as a next step we have to discretize the impulse balance equation .",
    "most of the terms can be discretized by central differences : @xmath94 but the convective terms require an upwind discretization @xmath95 if @xmath96 or @xmath97 have positive direction and otherwise @xmath98    we observed that the stability of the scheme is improved for silicon if the current density is first updated by @xmath99 and then @xmath100 is updated by the convective terms , but with @xmath96 and @xmath97 replaced by the values resulting from @xmath100 .",
    "the electron temperature is related to the energy density by the relation @xmath101 and can therefore be regarded as a dependent variable .",
    "the energy balance equation is discretized by defining first @xmath102 such that @xmath103 is also defined by our upwind procedure .",
    "then the discretization is given by @xmath104 where we have defined three energy currents @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "we simulated an @xmath0 ballistic diode , which models the electron flow in the channel of a mosfet , and exhibits hot electron effects at scales on the order of a micrometer .",

    "stationary results were obtained by applying to the device in thermal equilibrium a bias which increased at a rate of typically 1 volt per picosecond from zero volts to the desired final value .",
    "after 6 picoseconds , the stationary state was _ de facto _ reached , i.e. the current density was then constant up to @xmath125% .    in most cases we used @xmath126 discretization cells , which proved to be accurate enough , and time steps @xmath78 of the order of a femtosecond . a comparison with simulations with @xmath127 shows that all relevant quantities do not differ more than about 5% from the exact solution",

    "6 are nearly undistinguishable .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the ebm does not take inertia effects into account , which play no role for the stationary case .",
    "the predictive power of the two models is quite different , as we will see in the next section .",
    "but in the stationary case , the difference in the j - v - characteristics is , roughly speaking , averaged out .",
    "for gaas , the relaxation times are quite high . therefore , inertia effects will become important if the applied electric field changes at a high frequency .",

    "the relevant data like energy - dependent relaxation times and electron mass were obtained by two - valley mc simulations , where also the non - parabolicity of the two lowest conduction band valleys in gaas was taken into account . for the sake of brevity",
    "we will not go into details here , which will be given in a forthcoming paper concerning the full hydrodynamic simulation of a gaas mesfet structure .    in order to show the different behavior of the hdm and ebm in time - domain",

    "8 shows the particle current density in the exact middle of the device for both models as a function of time .",
    "whereas the current in the ebm reacts immediately to the applied field , the current in the hdm shows relaxation effects .",
    "the impulse relaxation time in the channel of the diode is of the order of 0.3 picoseconds , the energy relaxation time lies between 0.3 and 1 picosecond .",
    "we emphasize the fact that considering the total current @xmath141 does not help ; the effect remains .",
    "therefore we must conclude that the ebm , which is often termed `` hydrodynamic model '' in commercial semiconductor device simulators , may lead accidentally to reasonable ( static ) characteristics of a device , although the physical processes inside the device are modelled incorrectly .",
    "a simple discretization scheme for the hydrodynamic model is given in full detail which gives a valuable tool to the practitioner entering the field of hydrodynamic device modeling .",
    "comparisons of the different transport models show that the energy - balance model is capable of describing the behavior of submicron devices fairly well , but full hydrodynamic simulations are needed in order to give a satisfactory description of the device from the physical point of view . at high frequencies ,",
    "inertia effects become important in gaas and related materials .",
    "it is therefore clear that the ebm will be no longer adequate for simulation of high - speed submicron devices in the near future .",
