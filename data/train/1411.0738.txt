    "<S> we measure a maximum value of @xmath51 at @xmath52 , which corresponds to 1.4(2)% after accounting for the above - mentioned phonon - assisted emission . </S>",
    "<S> this value is comparable to the @xmath53 measured independently for cw laser of equivalent intensity , which represents the upper limit on ion - photon interaction observed with this cavity . in the high - excitation regime ( @xmath54 ) , where the main contribution to resonance fluorescence is incoherent , the absorption probability reduces by an order of magnitude , consistent with the theoretical prediction [ solid curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the laser - like absorption probability demonstrates that coherent scattering can provide an efficient interface for systems presenting a strong radiative linewidth mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> quantum - network protocols based on coherent scattering @xcite are inherently probabilistic owing to the sub - unity photon generation rate in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> that said , our results still predict an overall 20% higher efficiency of ion - state transfer over a deterministic generation scheme even when the coherent photon - generation probability is @xmath55 . </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) at @xmath56-t magnetic field the 20-ghz zeeman splitting between the two transitions of a negatively charged qd ensures that only the @xmath57-@xmath58 transition is resonant with the ion . </S>",
    "<S> the spin is prepared by optical pumping for a finite duration of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the @xmath57-@xmath58 transition is driven for a fixed time of 600 ns and the generated photons are sent to the ion . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the measured spin - projection dependence of the normalized ion - state transfer ( solid circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid ( dashed ) curve is the expected dependence including ( excluding ) imperfect laser rejection . ]    as a prerequisite for quantum - state transfer , we demonstrate classical communication between our solid - state and atomic nodes such that the internal state of the ion and the projection of the qd spin are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> first , we switch to a negatively charged qd under 0.7-t magnetic field in faraday configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this provides optical access to the spin projection of the qd states via the zeeman splitting of the ground and excited states [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57@xmath58 transition is tuned on resonance with the ion transition , while the @xmath60@xmath61 transition is off - resonant by @xmath62 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> second , we prepare the desired spin mixture through optical pumping by driving the @xmath63 transition with a pulse of variable duration , @xmath59 , and the @xmath64 transition with a 600-ns probe pulse . this alternating - pulses protocol provides a @xmath1 projection of the electron spin ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> state - preparation and photon - generation steps are alternated with a repetition rate of @xmath67khz during the qd - ion interaction time of 700@xmath68s . </S>",
    "<S> once again , the ion is prepared in the @xmath36 zeeman state of the @xmath69 manifold and absorbs @xmath37polarized photons leading to a state transfer to @xmath14s@xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed curve indicates the ideal correlation for our state - transfer experiments , while the solid curve represents the expected correlation calibrated for the presence of residual laser background . </S>",
    "<S> this sequence maps the @xmath1spin component of the qd to the internal state of the ion within an average uncertainty of 3.8% . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that an arbitrary qd spin projection is reproduced faithfully on the atomic node in the form of @xmath14s@xmath13 internal - state projection . </S>",
    "<S> + the optical interface demonstrated here links two quantum systems with significantly different optical characteristics via the exchange of single photons . by coherent photon generation and cqed techniques </S>",
    "<S> we have achieved direct coupling between these systems with an efficiency that surpasses limitations set by their intrinsic properties . </S>",
    "<S> our work can be extended to achieve faithful quantum - state transfer and distant entanglement between a qd and an ion . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine states of the trapped ion ( e.g. in @xmath70yb@xmath71 ) can serve as a long - term quantum memory for the qd spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> a key challenge for the implementation of such a scheme is reaching sufficient coupling strength between the nodes.while the overall efficiency of  5@xmath72 is shown here , we note that a 20-fold improvement in qd - photons collection efficiency has been recently achieved @xcite ; without in - situ monitoring of photons , a 10-fold reduction of loss in the optical link is straightforward , and increasing the absorption probability by a factor 30 through cavity improvements is within reach . </S>",
