    "the study of minimal surfaces in product spaces @xmath0 was initiated by rosenberg and meeks  @xcite and has been very active since then . among that spaces",
    ", there are three homogeneous riemannian manifolds : @xmath1 , where the classical theory of minimal surfaces has been developed , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where many authors have been actively working . giving a complete list of references in the subject is far from being possible so we will only mention a few of them : nelli and rosenberg  @xcite proved a jenkins - serrin - type theorem in @xmath3 , hauswirth  @xcite constructed minimal examples or riemann type , s earp and tobiana  @xcite investigated the screw motion invariant surfaces in @xmath3 , daniel  @xcite and hauwirth , s earp and tobiana  @xcite showed , independently , the existence of an associated family of minimal immersions for simply connected minimal surfaces in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , urbano and the author  @xcite tackled a general study of minimal surfaces in @xmath4 with applications to @xmath2 , and very recently manzano , plehnert and the author  @xcite constructed orientable and non - orientable even euler characteristic embedded minimal surfaces in the quotient @xmath5 and martn , mazzeo and rogrguez  @xcite constructed the first examples of complete , properly embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath3 with finite total curvature and positive genus .    in this paper",
    "we are going to show a geometric relation between maximal surfaces in anti - de sitter space - time @xmath6 and minimal immersions in @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that the gauss map of a spacelike maximal immersion in @xmath6 is always a minimal lagrangian immersion in @xmath7 ( see  @xcite and also  @xcite where an analogous case for lagrangian minimal immersions in @xmath4 is studied ) .",
    "we are going to get new minimal immersions in @xmath8 by pairing different components of the gauss map of two suitable maximal immersions in anti - de sitter space - time ( see theorem  [ thm : gauss - map - pair ] ) .",
    "this construction is in the same spirit as in  @xcite . from that , and under an appropriate choice of one element in the pair , we will establish a conformal correspondence between maximal immersions in anti - de sitter space - time and minimal immersions in @xmath9 ( see corollary  [ cor : gauss - map - h2xr ] ) .",
    "we will also show that this result admits a local converse , i.e.  that roughly speaking every minimal surface in @xmath3 is locally the gauss map of a maximal immersion in anti - de sitter space ( see theorem  [ thm : local - correspondence ] ) .",
    "finally , we will illustrate this geometric correspondence by showing new examples of maximal surfaces in anti - de sitter space in proposition  [ prop : examples - ads ] and computing their gauss map ( in the sense of corollary  [ cor : gauss - map - h2xr ] ) .",
    "this will provide us with two @xmath10-parameter families of minimal examples in @xmath9 .",
    "we want to point out that , although the constructed maximal immersions in @xmath6 are non - complete ( see proposition  [ prop : examples - ads ] ) , their corresponding minimal immersions in @xmath3 induce complete metrics in the surface .",
    "moreover , they are invariant by screw motions and they were first described in  @xcite .    the structure of the paper is the following : section  [ sec : preliminaries ] introduces both anti - de sitter space - time @xmath6 and the riemannian products @xmath8 and @xmath3 , where @xmath11 stands for the hyperbolic plane . in section  [ sec",
    ": maximal - ads ] , we will briefly present some basic facts about maximal surfaces in anti - de sitter space as well as some examples . section  [ sec : gauss - map - of - a - pair ] contains the main theorems that are illustrated in section  [ sec : examples ] . finally , section  [ sec : appendix ] contains an analysis of the solutions to the sinh - gordon equation that only depend on one variable .",
    "let @xmath11 be the hyperbolic plane and @xmath13 its metric .",
    "although for all computations we will use the hyperboloid model of @xmath11 , i.e.  @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , the poincar disc model is also considered in figures  [ fig : positive - energy ] and  [ fig : negative - energy ] .",
