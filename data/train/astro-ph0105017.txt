    "pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stellar evolution has been extensively modeled in the last decade . unfortunately , very few pms stars have provided detailed observational tests of these models , in large part due to the lack of dynamical mass determinations .",
    "recently a precise mass determination has been achieved for the secondary of the eclipsing binary ty  cra ( casey et al .",
    "1998 , corporon et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "casey et al .",
    "tested three sets of evolutionary tracks against the 1.64 m@xmath5 secondary , and found that all were consistent with the observed physical parameters .",
    "covino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analysed the eclipsing binary rxj 0529.4 + 0041 and compared the 1.25 m@xmath5 primary star and the 0.91 m@xmath5 secondary star with three sets of evolutionary tracks .",
    "they found that the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tracks provide the closest agreement with the derived masses of both stars .",
    "stellar masses have also been measured via orbital motions of disk gas ( e.g. , guilloteau et al .  1999 , simon et al .",
    "this is currently the only technique available to obtain the mass of a single star , but it is limited by distance uncertainty .",
    "simon et al . ( 2001 ) found that pms evolutionary models that presented cooler t@xmath6 ( e.g. baraffe et al .",
    "1998 and palla & stahler 1999 ) provided a better fit with their derived masses of nine pms stars .",
    "another powerful method for stellar mass determination is the combination of spectroscopic and astrometric observations of a binary star .",
    "in addition to all of the orbital elements , the combination of an angular measure of the orbit from astrometry and a linear measure from radial velocities allows an independent determination of the binary distance .",
    "this paper describes such a study of the naked t tauri binary ntt 045251 + 3016 .",
    "ntt 045251 + 3016 was first discovered with the einstein x - ray observatory as an optically visible star associated with an x - ray source .",
    "detailed ubvrijhkl photometry and optical spectra for the primary star are presented by walter et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , who derived a k7 spectral classification for the primary star , and also identified the system as a spectroscopic binary .",
    "improved spectral classification of the primary is discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "based on a mean radial velocity near to that of the taurus - auriga association and a li  i @xmath76707  equivalent width of 0.58 walter et al . (",
    "1988 ) identified ntt 045251 + 3016 as a pms star .",
    "ntt 045251 + 3016 is unique among known pms binaries in that it has an orbit with a short enough period to permit measurable radial - velocity variations of the primary and secondary stars while at the same time being wide enough to spatially resolve the two stars with hst s fine guidance sensor .",
    "we describe here an observational program to obtain both spectroscopic and astrometric data , thereby determining the masses of both pms stars and the distance to the binary .",
    "the first interferometric observation of ntt 045251 + 3016 with the astrometer fine guidance sensor no.3 ( fgs3 ) aboard hst was executed on april 14 , 1995 .",
    "the target was visited on 17 different occasions during the subsequent 3.3-year observing campaign ( completed aug 20 , 1998 ) , covering approximately one quadrant of the apparent orbit .",
    "the interferometric mode of fgs3 is used to sample the visibility function ( vf ) produced by the koester s prism interferometer as the field - of - view of the unit is driven across the target . for best results , the fgs was commanded to oversample the vf by taking measurements every 0.6 mas ( on the sky ) during a scan of @xmath8 1500 mas in length .",
    "the scan length used is sufficient , during normal operations , to encompass the sensitivity range of the interferometer , which extends for @xmath8 20 mas around the line - of - sight to the target .",
    "fgs3 is endowed with two koester s prisms that provide sensitivity in two orthogonal directions , usually referred to as the fgs x and y axes ( lupie & nelan 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , each scan of the target results in two vf s which are then independently analyzed for signatures other than those characteristic of a suitable single ( and point - like ) star chosen as template .",
    "deviations from the single - star vf provide measures of the projected separations of the binary at each observing epoch .",
    "the comparison with the template also provides two independent estimates of the magnitude difference between the two companions . on - sky separation ( @xmath9 ) and astronomical position angle ( pa )",
    "are easily derived from the projected separations and telescope attitude data ( bernacca et al . 1993 ) .",
    "fifteen consecutive scans were taken on each visit to check on scan - to - scan repeatability and for improvement of the s / n .",
    "the average s / n ratio of the observed scans is @xmath8 20 , which improved to @xmath8 @xmath10 after merging of the scans ( lattanzi et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "the shape of the visibility curve changes with effective wavelength , which can introduce systematic errors if the color of the template differs significantly from that of the target . to minimize this effect , we selected star sao185689 ( ( b - v)=1.5 mag ) as the template single star . among the templates made available by the st sci for fgs reductions ,",
    "this is the star with the color closest to that of our binary ( observed ( b - v)=1.28 mag ) .",
    "fourteen of the 17 visits produced successful measurements of the binary separation and orientation .",
    "these measurements are listed in table 1 .",
    "the 85% success rate is gratifying given both the small separation ( @xmath8 3 times smaller than the airy angular resolution limit at visible light ) and the relatively large magnitude difference ( more than 2 magnitudes ) .",
    "the formal error of the projected separations is @xmath8 1 mas on each axis .",
    "however , this error is internal , as it only takes into account the contribution due to the reduction method , which is based on an analytical cross - correlation technique ( bernacca et al .",
    "there are other error sources which are known to be present but are difficult to quantify for each observation . as an example , the epochs of observation of the calibration star are usually quite different ( up to 5 months ) from the dates of the visits to our target ; consequently , the template star might not be the best representation of the fgs signatures at the time of the science observation , as small changes are known to occur even on relatively short time scales . by comparing observations of the template star taken at different times , we have measured variations in the structure of the vf which could increase the separation measurement error to 2 - 3 mas . therefore , this is probably a more realistic range for the error of several of the measured projected separations in table 1 .",
    "this corresponds to 3 - 4 mas for the ( 1 @xmath11 ) error on total separation and to @xmath8 14@xmath12 for the maximum error in pa .",
    "table 1 also shows the measurements of the visual magnitude difference between the two companions .",
    "the values derived from the independent fits to the x and y vf s are generally in good agreement except for the tenth and twelfth measurements . averaging the results yields @xmath13 2.2 @xmath0 0.3 mag and @xmath14 2.3 @xmath0 0.3 mag for the average magnitude differences on the x and y axes , respectively .",
    "again , these results are consistent with instrument performances expected in a challenging scenario like ours , i.e. , small separation and relatively large magnitude difference .      since 1985 we have monitored the radial velocity of ntt 045251 + 3016 with the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometers ( latham 1992 ) .",
    "three nearly identical instruments were used on the multiple mirror telescope and 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the whipple observatory atop mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona , and on the 1.5-m wyeth reflector located in harvard , massachusetts .",
    "echelle spectrographs were used with intensified photon - counting reticon detectors to record about 45    of spectrum in a single order centered near 5187   , with a resolution of about 8.3  kms@xmath15  and signal - to - noise ratios ranging from 8 to 15 per resolution element .",
    "radial velocities were derived from the 58 observed optical spectra using the one - dimensional correlation package * rvsao * ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) running inside the iraf environment .",
    "the template spectrum was drawn from a new grid of synthetic spectra ( morse & kurucz , in preparation ) calculated using model atmospheres computed using kurucz s code atlas9 .",
    "we correlated our observed spectra against a grid of solar metallicity templates and chose the one that gave the highest average peak correlation .",
    "the highest peak correlation averaged over all 58 observed spectra was obtained for @xmath16 k , @xmath17 cms@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 0.0 $ ] , and @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the heliocentric velocities derived with this template are reported in table 2 , together with the heliocentric julian date and ( o - c ) errors .",
    "the rms deviation about the orbital solution is 0.7 @xmath21 , typical of cfa precision for late - type dwarfs .",
    "an implicit assumption of our analysis is that the spectra of pms stars can be reliably modeled using normal stellar atmospheres .",
    "however , a small template mismatch would not affect significantly the accuracy of the radial - velocity measurements .",
    "we attempted to detect the secondary spectrum in the optical with high s / n observations of ntt 045251 + 3016 taken in february 1992 , near a time of maximum velocity separation , with the hamilton echelle spectrograph on the 3-m shane telescope of lick observatory .",
    "the wavelength region covered was from 3800  to 9800  with a s / n of 30 .",
    "cross - correlating our high signal - to - noise spectrum with a variety of templates did not reveal the secondary s spectrum . to test our detection limits , c. dolan created synthetic double - lined spectra using a narrow - lined k6v spectral standard rotationally broadened to 10 @xmath22 to match the rotationally broadened spectrum of ntt 045251 + 3016 .",
    "this primary spectrum was combined with numerous secondary spectra ranging in spectral type ( k2v to m2v ) , in rotational velocities ( 5 to 50 @xmath21 ) , in mass ratios ( 1.0 to 0.5 ) , and in flux ratios ( 1.0 to 0.05 ) .",
    "dolan found that to detect the secondary s spectrum a minimum flux ratio of @xmath8 0.2 - 0.4 is required , except in cases with extreme rotational broadening ( @xmath23 @xmath22 ) when the secondary becomes undetectable even with a luminosity ratio of 1.0 .",
    "thus our non - detection is consistent with our fgs determined magnitude difference of 2.4 mag in _ v _ , corresponding to a flux ratio of 0.11 .      since we were unable to detect the secondary in the optical , we obtained two spectra of the binary with phoenix , the kpno high - resolution near - infrared spectrograph on the 4-m mayall telescope .",
    "details on this work are given in mazeh et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) .",
    "the central wavelength of the observations was 1.555@xmath24 m and yielded a free spectral range of @xmath25 @xmath21 ; the effective resolution was 35,000 .",
    "we also observed a sample of 12 main - sequence spectral - type standards from f6 through m7 , in order to provide templates for a two - dimensional cross - correlation analysis using todcor ( zucker & mazeh 1994 ) .",
    "we successfully detected the secondary spectrum using spectra of hr 8085 ( 61 cyg a ; k5 ) and hr 8086 ( 61 cyg b ; k7 ) , each rotationally broadened by @xmath26 , as the primary and secondary templates , respectively .",
    "the velocities are given in table 3 .",
    "our derived flux ratio at 1.555@xmath24 m is @xmath27 .    to estimate our uncertainty due to template mismatch we used todcor to derive the velocity of each template with regard to the other templates .",
    "the scatter of these derived velocities is less than @xmath28 @xmath21 .",
    "this error is added in quadrature to the estimated uncertainty of the peak location of each spectrum , for a total uncertainty of @xmath29 @xmath21 .",
    "the radial velocities of the primary derived from these nir spectra are consistent to within this uncertainty with the radial velocities predicted by the primary orbital solution at the same epoch , which suggests that our radial - velocity zero - point is also accurate at this level .",
    "nine of the relative orbital elements of ntt 045251 + 3016 were calculated via a simultaneous fit to the relative astrometric and primary radial - velocity data , using a program generously provided by g. torres .",
    "table 4 shows the orbital elements of the binary ntt 045251 + 3016 .",
    "the astrometric and spectroscopic data and orbital solutions are presented in figures 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "although the orbital solution is solved via a simultaneous fit to both the relative astrometric and primary radial - velocity data , the large number of radial - velocity measurements provide a strong constraint on the elements of the orbital solution that can be calculated with single - lined spectroscopic data ( i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , in practice , the orbital parameters that are being determined with the astrometric data are the angular size of the semi - major axis ( _ a_(@xmath36 ) ) , the position angle of the line of nodes ( @xmath37 ) , and the inclination angle ( _ i _ ) .    furthermore , the only parameter influencing the mass determination which is derived from the astrometric data is the inclination .",
    "as can be seen from the orientation of the line of nodes in figure 1 , the inclination is quite well constrained by the phase coverage of these data .",
    "the distance to the system , essentially set by the angular semi - major axis , is more sensitive to the partial phase coverage and possible systematic errors in the fgs astrometry .    with detection of the secondary in the near - infrared spectra ,",
    "the mass ratio , _ q _ , was calculated using the _ calculated _ radial velocity of the primary from the orbital solution at the time of the near - infrared observations , the center - of - mass velocity of the binary , and the mean of the two _ measured _ radial velocities of the secondary which were obtained from ir spectra .",
    "this mass ratio , in combination with the 9 known orbital elements , allowed us to calculate the individual masses of the stars in the binary and the distance to the system .",
    "the masses of the primary and secondary stars are given by the equations ( batten 1973 ) :    @xmath38 = \\frac{3.793 \\times 10^{-5 } \\ , \\sqrt[3]{(1-e^2 ) } \\ : ( k_{1}+k_{1}/q)^{2 } \\ : ( k_{1}/q ) \\ : p}{(\\sin{i})^{3}}\\ ] ]    @xmath39 = \\frac{3.793 \\times 10^{-5 } \\ , \\sqrt[3]{(1-e^2 ) } \\ : ( k_{1}+k_{1}/q)^{2 } \\",
    ": k_{1 } \\ : p}{(\\sin{i})^{3}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is in years and @xmath32 is in km s@xmath15 .",
    "we determine the masses of the primary and secondary to be @xmath40 m@xmath5 and @xmath41 m@xmath5 , respectively . from equation 1",
    "we find that the largest contributors to the variance of the dynamical mass of the primary are the measurement error associated with the radial velocity of the secondary ( @xmath42 of the variance ) and the error on the measurement of the orbital inclination ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the largest contributer to the variance of the secondary s dynamical mass comes from the error associated with the orbital inclination of the binary ( @xmath44 ) , followed by the error associated with the measured radial velocity of the secondary ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we note that the mass uncertainties associated with our limited number of secondary radial - velocity measurements can be reduced substantially now with additional observations ; higher precision astrometry awaits future instrumentation .    the dynamical distance _",
    "d _ in parsecs is given by :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is in arcseconds .",
    "our direct distance measurement to the pms binary of 145 @xmath0 8 pc agrees with prior distance estimates to the taurus - auriga complex based on indirect methods ( e.g. , 140 @xmath0 10 pc ( kenyon et al . 1994 ) ) and geometric parallax ( e.g. , @xmath48 pc ( bertout et al .  1999 ) , and @xmath49 pc ( wichmann et al . 1998 ) ) . the center - of - mass velocity of the system , @xmath50 , is somewhat lower than the mean radial velocity of the taurus - auriga complex ( 17.4 kms@xmath15 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1986 ) , but with an association velocity dispersion of 2 @xmath21 the binary radial velocity is consistent with membership in the association .",
    "in this context we also note that the binary is located at the edge of the association in the auriga subcomplex .    the largest contributor to the variance of the distance",
    "to ntt 045251 + 3016 comes from the error on the measurement of the angular semi - major axis ( @xmath51 ) . since our astrometric data cover only a little more than one quadrant of the orbit , it does not provide a tight constraint on the measurement of the angular semi - major axis ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "table 4 summarizes our measured masses and distance to the components of ntt 045251 + 3016 .",
    "there are now a variety of pms models that provide the luminosity and effective temperature of a star given its mass and age .",
    "the differences between these models lie largely in the choice of opacities , atmospheres , metallicities , and convection models . in principle",
    ", a pms star of known mass , luminosity , effective temperature , and metallicity can distinguish between these differences in stellar physics .",
    "ntt 045251 + 3016 provides such a case .",
    "the primary star of ntt 045251 + 3016 was originally classified as a k7 spectral type ( walter et al .",
    "however , analysis of eight temperature sensitive lines used for spectral classification by lee ( 1992 ) ( vi @xmath76040 fei @xmath76042 fei , @xmath76056 vi @xmath76058 nii @xmath76108 vi @xmath76112 fei @xmath76200 sci @xmath76211 ) in our hamilton echelle spectra clearly point to a k5 classification with an uncertainty of less than one subtype .",
    "the fei and sci line pair around @xmath76200  in particular was used by basri & batalha ( 1990 ) for spectral classification .",
    "figure 3 compares this line pair from our spectra with three spectral standards hr 8832 ( k3v ) , hr 8085 ( k5v ) , and hr 8086 ( k7v ) .    using the photometry of walter et al .",

    "thus could not calculate the _ b _ magnitude for the primary and secondary individually , we calculated the extinction in _",
    "v _ using two different methods .",
    "first we assumed that the secondary did not contribute to the light in the _ b _ band , so the _ b _ magnitude calculated in walter et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ( b=12.88 ) was the _",

    "alternatively , we assumed the _",
    "band is unaffected by extinction and compared the calculated _ ( v - h ) _ for the primary with the _ ( v - h ) _ for a k5 dwarf given in kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) , finding a visual extinction of a@xmath53 mag for the primary of ntt 045251 + 3016 .",
    "we adopt a@xmath54 mag throughout this paper .",
    "since there are temperature and color variations within the k5 spectral class we define the range on these parameters by the midpoints between the values given for a k5 type and the values for k3 and k7 types , respectively .",
    "these upper and lower limits on temperature or color are shown in figures 4 , 5 , & 6 as separate points connected by a solid line .",
    "this line represents the maximum error range on temperature / color based on our spectral type uncertainty , not a random error .",
    "the smaller distance uncertainties and photometric uncertainties are represented as error bars on each point .",

    "( 1998 , bcah98 ) tracks are plotted on @xmath55 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with ntt 045251 + 3016 ( figure 4 ) . since the solar metallicity template provided the strongest correlation when analyzing the optical spectra , we only test tracks with solar metallicity .",
    "bcah98 s use of the non - grey `` nextgen '' atmosphere models of allard and hauschildt ( 1997 ) allows their tracks to be plotted directly on cmd diagrams .",
    "the use of non - grey atmosphere models is superior because grey atmospheres tend to overestimate the luminosity and effective temperature of a star of a given mass ( bcah98 , and references therein ) .",
    "also , bcah98 argue that cmds are superior to luminosity - @xmath2 diagrams because the latter usually depends upon empirically based color-@xmath2 or color - bolometric corrections which are derived from a stellar sample with a range of metallicity , gravity , and age .    the pms model that provides the closest agreement with our dynamical primary mass is given by the bcah98 tracks that use a general mixing length parameter @xmath56 = @xmath57 , [ m / h ] = 0.0 , and y = 0.275 .",
    "these tracks predict the mass of the primary to be between 1.15 - 1.20 m@xmath5 .",
    "as seen in figure 4 , this mass range deviates between 1.3 and 1.6 sigma from our dynamical primary mass measurement .",
    "the second set of pms tracks shown in figure 4 were designed by bcah98 to reproduce the properties of the sun at 4.61 gyr .",
    "the primary modification in these tracks is an increase in the mixing length parameter , @xmath56 , along with a small change in the helium abundance ( @xmath4 and y = 0.28 ) . using these tracks",
    "the derived mass range of the primary is 1.05 m@xmath5 to 1.15 m@xmath5 , which is 1.6 - 2.1 sigma from our dynamical primary mass .",
    "thus while models with this increased mixing length parameter do not provide as close agreement with our measured dynamical mass as @xmath3 models , they are nonetheless consistent with our measurements . while the difference between these two mixing length parameters is rather inconsequential below @xmath58 m@xmath5 , it becomes important for stars above this mass ( bcah98 ) .",

    "this birthline assists in providing more accurate age estimates to stars that have formed from the same environment .",
    "the ps99 tracks use a grey atmosphere approximation and employ the opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for low temperatures and the opal opacities of iglesis & rogers ( 1996 ) for high temperatures ( @xmath59k ) with a composition x = 0.70 , y = 0.28 ( ps99 ) .",

    "our final comparison is with the pms tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 , dm97 ) . in 1994 ,",
    "dantona & mazzitelli released a set of pms tracks that did not use standard mixing length theory ( mlt ) to model the convection within the stellar envelope but instead treated the extended envelope of a pms star with a ` multiple eddy ' model called the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model ( canuto & mazzitelli 1991 ) . in 1997 ,",

    "the isochrones are consistent with coevality of the two stars in the binary and predict the age of the components of the binary to be approximately @xmath69 yr .    the bcah98 pms model that uses a mixing length parameter @xmath70 predicts a mass of 0.67 m@xmath5 for the secondary which is within the 2.0 sigma range about our measured dynamical mass of the secondary .",
    "the primary star is estimated to be around @xmath71 yr old while the secondary is about @xmath72 yr old .",

    "palla & stahler s pms tracks ( 1999 ) give the mass of the secondary to be 0.35 m@xmath5 , to be compared with our measured value for the secondary mass of 0.81 m@xmath5 . at this position among the ps99 tracks the predicted mass of the secondary depends only on t@xmath6 .",
    "a 1.0 sigma variation on t@xmath6 corresponds to a change in mass of 0.15 m@xmath5 .",
    "even when combined with the error on the dynamical mass of the secondary of 0.09 m@xmath5 , the mass predicted by the ps99 tracks is 2.5 sigma from our measured dynamical mass .",
    "interestingly , the isochrones provided by ps99 suggest the largest relative age difference in the two stars among the tracks tested in this paper . using the ps99 isochrones ,",
    "the primary is over @xmath71 yr old while the secondary is only @xmath73 yr old .",
    "however , these age determinations are only distinct between the 1 and 2 sigma confidence level",
    ".    the dm97 tracks also give a mass for the secondary of 0.34 m@xmath5 . as with the ps99 tracks ,",
    "the secondary s location with respect to the dm97 tracks makes the predicted mass sensitive primarily to changes in t@xmath6 .",
    "a 1.0 sigma change in t@xmath6 corresponds to a change in predicted mass of 0.1 m@xmath5 . combining this uncertainty with the error on the measured mass we find that the secondary mass predicted by the dm97 tracks is at least 3 sigma from the dynamical mass .",
    "the dm97 isochrones give the ages of both the primary and secondary stars to be @xmath74 yr and @xmath75 yr , respectively .",
    "these ages are within 1 sigma of being coeval .",
    "in this paper we present dynamical masses for the components of the binary ntt 045251 + 3016 .",
    "these mass measurements were derived from analysis of astrometric data from the hubble space telescope fine guidance sensors , optical spectroscopic data from the digital speedometers at cfa , and ir spectroscopic data from phoenix at kpno .",
    "our measured values for the primary and secondary masses are 1.45 @xmath0 0.19 m@xmath1 and 0.81 @xmath0 0.09 m@xmath1 , respectively , at a distance of 145 @xmath0 8 pc .",
    "the uncertainties in these mass measurements can be readily reduced by more numerous measurements of the secondary radial velocity , which we encourage .",
    "the measured primary and secondary masses are compared to predicted masses of three sets of pms tracks : baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , palla & stahler ( 1999 ) , and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) .",
    "the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tracks that use the `` next gen '' non - grey atmosphere models of allard and hauschildt ( 1997 ) and a mixing length parameter @xmath76 provide the closest agreement with our results .",
    "the masses predicted by the models deviate between 1.3 and 1.6 sigma from our measured primary mass and less than 1.0 sigma from our measured secondary mass .",
    "the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tracks with @xmath4 predict a primary mass that is between 1.6 and 2.1 sigma from our measured primary mass , and a secondary mass that is within 2 sigma of our dynamical value .",
    "the pms tracks of palla & stahler ( 1999 ) give a primary mass range that deviates 1.6 - 2.9 sigma from our dynamical primary mass , and the predicted secondary mass is 2.5 sigma from our dynamical value . finally , the values for the primary and secondary masses provided by the tracks of dantona and mazzitelli ( 1997 ) , which uses the full spectrum of turbulance ( fst ) to model stellar convection rather than standard mixing length theory ( mlt ) , deviate by more than 3.0 sigma from our measured dynamical masses .",
    "we therefore conclude that the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the palla & stahler ( 1999 ) models are consistant with our observations of ntt 045251 + 3016 , while the dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) tracks are inconsistant at a significant confidence level .    if we assume the binary system is coeval , we can use our observations to constrain the relative accuracy of the isochrones provided by each pms model .",
    "all three pms models tested are consistant with coeval formation of both components .",
    "better determination of the effective temperatures of the component stars will be needed to provide a tighter constraint on the pms isochrones .",
    "all of the pms evolutionary tracks tested in this paper underestimate the masses of both the primary and secondary stars .",
    "the secondary star lies amidst the hayashi tracks , and our observations demand cooler effective temperatures for the 0.8 mo tracks .",
    "the same is true for the primary star when compared to the dantona and mazzitelli models .",
    "however , when compared to the baraffe et al .",
    "and palla & stahler tracks the primary lies at the transition between the convective and radiative tracks . for these models our observations of",
    "the primary star require both cooler temperatures and lower luminosities .",
    "this need for cooler effective temperatures from the evolutionary models is similar to the recent findings of simon et al .",
    "interestingly , dantona , ventura , and mazzitelli ( 2000 ) argue that the effective temperatures predicted by present pms evolutionary models are actually upper limits , because magnetic fields , which are not included in any of the models tested here , act to reduce effective temperature .",
    "we are indebted to the space telescope science institute , and especially the fgs team , for superb technical support throughout this program and for funding support .",
    "we also thank the many cfa observers who have obtained observations over the 15 years of this program and e. goldberg for helping with the todcor analysis .",
    "finally , the generous contribution of software from g. torres , analyses and expertise from c. dolan , and additional evolutionary tracks from i. baraffe , were invaluable .",
