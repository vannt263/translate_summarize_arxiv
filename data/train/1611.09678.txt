    "the signature of electron - acoustic ( ea ) waves was first observed in the laboratory experiment of derfler and simonen @xcite . this led watanabe and taniuti @xcite to consider a plasma containing electron species of two distinct temperatures and ions , and led to predict theoretically the existence of the ea waves @xcite in which the restoring force ( inertia ) is provided by hot electron - temperatre ( cold electron mass ) .",
    "the ea wave frequency ( @xmath6 ) , in fact , satisfies the condition @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the ion ( cold electron ) plasma frequency .",
    "this means that in the ea waves ions are reasonably assumed to be stationary , and to maintain only the neutralizing background .",
    "the dispersion relation for the long - wavelength ( in comparision with the hot electron debye length ) ea waves is @xcite @xmath10 , where @xmath3 is the wave number , and @xmath11 [ where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) being the unperturbed cold ( hot ) electron number density , @xmath14 being the hot electron temperature in units of the boltzmann constant , @xmath15 being the cold electron mass ] is the electron - acoustic speed .",
    "the long wavelength ea waves are also detected in space plasma environments @xcite .",
    "the conditions for the existence of the linear ea waves and their dispersion properties are now well - understood from both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite points of view .",
    "the basic properties of the nonlinear ea waves , particularly ea solitons in electron - ion plasmas have been investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear structures in degenerate plasmas have also received a renewed interest in understanding the localized electrostatic disturbances not only in astrophysical environments ( such as neutron stars , white dwarfs , magnetars , etc .",
    "@xcite ) , but also in laboratory devices ( viz .",
    "solid density plasma produced by irradiating metals by intense laser , semiconductor devices , microelectronics , carbon nanotubes , quantum dots , and quantum wells , etc .",
    "recent investigations @xcite based on quantum hydrodynamic ( qhd ) model@xcite show a number of significant differences in nonlinear features of quantum plasmas from those in classical electron - ion plasmas .",
    "the qhd model is a useful approximation to study the short - scale nonlinear structures in dense ( degenerate ) quantum plasmas @xcite , where the effects of degenerate ( instead of thermal ) pressure , exchange correlation potential , and bohm potential can be included .",
    "recently , zhenni et .",
    "@xcite have studied ea solitary waves or shortly ea solitons in magnetized quantum plasma with relativistic electrons , while chandra and ghosh @xcite have studied the modulational instability of the ea waves in relativistically degenerate quantum plasmas . however , they have not considered the exchange correlation and bohm potentials in their investigation . therefore , in our present work , we investigate linear and nonlinear propagation of the quantum ea ( qea ) waves to include the effects of superthermality @xcite of hot electron component , and quantum effects due to the degenerate particle pressure , exchange correlation and bohm potentials of cold electron component .",
    "we also study the amplitude modulation of the slow evolution of the qea envelope solitions ( qeaess ) by deriving a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation by taking these effects into account .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the basic equations governing the plasma system under consideration are provided in sec .",
    "the nls equation for the nonlinear propagation of the ea waves is derived by applying the reductive perturbation technique , and their linear as well as nonlinear properties are examined in sec .",
    "a brief discussion is presented in sec .",
    "we consider a three - component plasma system containing cold quantum electron fluid with fermi energy @xmath16 @xcite , inertialess , superthermal @xcite or hot electron component , and uniformly distributed stationary ions @xcite .",
    "thus , at equilibrium we have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number density of plasma species @xmath19 ( @xmath20 for cold electron species , @xmath21 for hot electron species , and @xmath22 for stationary ion species ) . the dynamics of the qea waves in such a three - component quantum plasma system is governed by the following set of qhd equations @xcite",
    ": @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the number density ( fluid speed ) of the cold electron species ; @xmath26 is the electrostatic wave potential ; @xmath27 ( @xmath15 ) is the electron charge ( mass ) ; @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the spatial ( time ) variable ; @xmath30 , in which @xmath31 is the non - relativistically degenerate cold electron pressure , and is given by @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the planck constant divided by @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the bohm potential , and is given by @xcite @xmath36 which is due to the tunneling effect of the cold electrons ; and @xmath37 is the exchange - correlation potential , and is given by @xcite @xmath38 , \\label{beq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the exchange - correlation potential can be separated into two terms , namely the hartree term due to the electrostatic potential of the total cold electron number density and the cold electron exchange - correlation potential term @xcite .    the hot electron species is assumed to be superthermal ( @xmath0 distributed ) .",
    "thus , the number density ( @xmath40 ) of the hot electron species is given by @xcite @xmath41^{-\\kappa+1/2 } , \\label{beq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is hot electron temperature , and @xmath0 is the spectral index measuring the deviation from the thermal equilibrium , and its value is @xmath42 for superthermal electrons @xcite .",
    "we now normalize all the variables as follows : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "to derive the nls equation for slow evolution of the qea waves by the reductive perturbation method @xcite , we first introduce the stretched coordinates : @xmath60 and expand the dependent variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the group velocity of the qea waves ( to be determined later ) , @xmath66 is an expansion parameter ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath3 ) is the angular frequency ( wave number ) of the carrier qea waves .",
    "the quantities @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the @xmath71-th harmonic of the @xmath72-th order slowly varying dependent variables , and these satisfy the reality condition @xmath73 , in which @xmath74 denotes the complex conjugate of the quantity involved .    now , substituting ( [ str1])- ( [ exp3 ] ) into ( [ beq12])-([beq14 ] ) , and performing few steps of straight forward mathematics , we can obtain the 1st harmonic of the 1st order ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) reduced equations , which allow us to express the linear dispersion for the qea waves as @xmath77 we note here that the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 account for the quantum effects due to the degenerate particle pressure , particle exchange - correlation potential , and the bohm potential , respectively , on the linear dispersion relation for the qea waves .",
    "so , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 represent the quantum effects due to the degenerate particle pressure , particle exchange - correlation potential , and the bohm potential , respectively .",
    "we have shown how these quantum effects ( represented by @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ) vary with the carrier qea wavenumber @xmath3 .",

    "it is observed from figure [ f1 ] that the effect of the electron degenerate pressure is more significant than that of both exchange - correlation and bohm potentials .",
    "it is further observed from figure [ f1 ] that the effect of the exchange - correlation ( bohm ) potential is more significant for the smaller ( larger ) values of the carrier wavenumber @xmath3 .",

    "it is obvious from figures [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] that for long wavelength limit ( which corresponds to a very low @xmath3-value range ) the angular frequency @xmath6 linearly increases with @xmath3 , and for short wavelength limit ( which corresponds to a very high @xmath3-value range ) it is independent of @xmath3 ( saturated region ) .",
