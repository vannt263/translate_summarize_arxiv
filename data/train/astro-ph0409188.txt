    "modern studies of the kinematical , physical and chemical status of star forming regions are largely based on the information delivered by emission in molecular lines .",
    "different molecular transitions have different excitation temperatures , as a result of the radiative and collisional population exchange between quantum levels . in the stationary case",
    "these take the form of pumping cycles ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "excitation states of molecular transitions are mostly characterized by positive excitation temperatures and , hence , the optical depths of the corresponding lines are mostly positive . such lines are called quasi - thermal  and trace the whole extent of the sufficiently dense and warm environment of the massive young stellar object where the corresponding molecule is abundant .    under specific conditions , in some regions of a molecular cloud the pump cycles can lead to extreme overheating of some quantum transitions and their excitation temperatures might become negative ( see , e.g. , ) . in this case",
    "the optical depth of the corresponding line becomes negative and emission from material which is more distant from the observer is amplified at the transition frequency instead of being hidden .",
    "such extreme deviation from the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is called a maser and often leads to extremely bright lines arising from compact areas which can be substantially smaller in size than the region where the maser is formed ( see , e.g. , ) .    at present , combined analysis of the data in both types of lines ( i.e.",
    ", maser and quasi - thermal  ) is uncommon .",
    "the main reason is that the spatial resolutions used in the maser research ( rather small fractions of an arcsecond , down to microarcseconds ) and in the quasi - thermal  line research ( arcseconds and tens of arcseconds ) are greatly different .    from the time of its discovery",
    ", maser emission has provided very important information on the nature and kinematics of associated objects . despite this , the structure of the masing regions themselves is rather unclear ; these are the regions where maser amplification may develop along particular lines of sight due to the existence of population inversion .",
    "for example , current models of maser excitation meet great difficulties in trying to produce extremely bright masers in regions matching the sizes of the tiny maser hot spots which are determined interferometrically . at the same time",
    "there are indications that the masing regions have extensions much greater than these spot sizes . indeed ,",
    "analysis of multi - transitional observations of a masing molecule such as methanol ( ch@xmath0oh ) shows that the sizes of the masing regions can be comparable to those of the associated molecular cores ( see , e.g. , , ) .",
    "there are indications that strong masers also form in rather extended regions .",
    "firstly , vlbi observations show that the strongest h@xmath1o and ch@xmath0oh masers have a core - extended halo  structure ( see , e.g. , , ) .",
    "secondly , absorption lines are detected with the 100-m telescope that correspond to transitions which are considerably overcooled only under conditions where the masing transitions are strongly inverted ( ) .",
    "one such line was observed with the vla ( ) .",
    "so , modern interferometry in some cases can provide the basis for combined analysis of data in both maser and quasi - thermal  types of lines .",
    "in this paper we analyse the data on methanol lines obtained with the bima interferometer . in the first section",
    "we show that the masing region can be filled with numerous optically elongated structures which are responsible for producing maser spikes and accompanying pedestal profiles .",
    "analysis of the data provides estimates of the physical parameters of the masing gas . in the second section",
    "we show that combined analysis of the data on the maser and quasi - thermal  methanol lines reveals the physical structure of the vicinity of the w3(oh ) ultracompact hii region .",
    "it is also shown that the size of the masing region exceeds that of maser hot spot sizes by orders of magnitude . in the third section we provide evidence",
    "that analysis of the quasi - thermal  line data may indicate the presence of previously unknown masing objects to the south - west of w3(oh ) , which are to be studied by interferometrical means . in turn",
    ", the data on the h@xmath1o masers around the tw object to the east of w3(oh ) show the presence of molecular material which can be detected in quasi - thermal  line emission .",
    "the bima interferometer was used to observe 24 methanol lines in 3 mm and 1 mm wavelength ranges toward w3(oh ) with a spectral resolution better than 1.2 km / s .",
    "details of the observations are described in ( ) . this source is a prototypical class ii methanol maser source . emission in 9 transitions which were predicted to mase under certain conditions ( ) was detected ( ) . some lines display pronounced narrow maser spike and pedestal profiles while others show the pedestal component alone .",
    "analysis of this data on newly discovered masers and maser candidate lines has brought considerable improvement to the model of the masing region in front of w3(oh ) .",
    "it was shown that maser action takes place in hot ( about 150 k ) , dense ( @xmath2 ) , methanol - rich gas in front of the uchii region , pumped by infrared radiation from warm dust . the observed variety of maser line profiles and flux ratios can be explained if the maser spike emission from w3(oh ) arises in the region where maser amplification is moderate and directional , whereas for the pedestal emission the maser action is weaker and directed less strongly towards the observer .",
    "this can be a result of the geometry of the maser region containing some regions greatly elongated along the line of sight and others elongated in different directions .",
    "the model predicted strong absorption in 6 methanol lines with frequencies 84.52121 , 85.56807 , 94.54181 , 95.16952 , 105.06376 , and 109.15321 ghz .",
    "the six lines which were predicted to show absorption in the masing region show double peaked profiles .",
    "these are not consistent with two emission components at fixed velocities , but , rather , can be well fitted with a superposition of 2 gaussians corresponding to common emitting and absorbing regions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "excitation analysis in the way described in ( ) has shown that the depths of the absorptions are well in accord with the model predictions .",
    "figure 2 shows that emission in the maps of absorbing lines at the maser velocities comes from a different spatial position than does the bulk of emission in maser lines .",
    "that means that the size of the masing region is comparable to the total spread of the 6.7 ghz class ii methanol maser spots .",
    "modelling of the methanol lines in the way described in ( and ) is consistent with the hypothesis that 2 methanol - rich regions are situated in front of the ultracompact hii region ( uchii ) in w3(oh ) : the first being a rather hot ( greater than 200 k ) and dense ( greater than @xmath3 ) methanol emitting region with angular size slightly exceeding that of the uchii , and the second region producing the strong masers and absorptions .",
    "the latter has a size of order 1 arcsecond , which is about 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of the 6.7 ghz maser spots , and corresponds to the total extent of the region where the strong class ii methanol masers are distributed .",
    "so , bima observations have shown that the methanol maser region in w3(oh ) has a size of a few by @xmath4 cm , and provided estimates of the physical parameters on the basis of combined analysis of the masing and quasi - thermally excited lines .",
    "km / s ) and absorbing ( @xmath5  km / s ) regions are shown .",
    "the line profiles are not consistent with two emission components at fixed velocities .",
    "this suggests that there is an absorbing region situated closer to the observer .",
    "so , it is likely that we see absorption against the line emitting background . ]",
    "sutton et al . ( 2004 ) showed that bima observations reveal the presence of extended features to the south - west of w3(oh ) which are traced by the methanol line emission ( see also lower panels in fig.2 ) .",
    "methanol is a chemical tracer of shocked regions , and analysis of the spatial structure of its emission in regions of massive star formation can lead to the discovery of extremely young stellar objects displaying maser emission ( ) . indeed , sutton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found 2 objects which are most pronounced in the class i methanol maser lines .",
    "excitation analysis carried out in this paper shows that these lines are most probably weak masers , which can be confirmed by interferometric measurements with higher spatial resolution .",
    "this can be done with the forthcoming carma facility or with the vla in counterpart lines of the same methanol line series .    in turn ,",
    "data on the maser emission of water around the tw young stellar object situated about 6@xmath6 to the east of w3(oh ) shows the presence of molecular material situated on both sides of the tw object with an almost equal angular separation of about 1@xmath6 .",
    "the nature of the material in the immediate vicinity of the tw object is unclear and can be explained in terms of the jet and edge - on disk ( ) .",
    "water masers are produced under very special conditions and can display great deviations from the systemic velocity of the source , i.e. , they might not reveal bulk motions of matter .",
    "so , observations of quasi - thermal  molecular emission in the tw vicinity with appropriate angular resolution are very important to clarify the situation and , in any case , help promote understanding of important processes related to the earliest stages of massive star formation .",
    "the existence of molecular material situated 1@xmath6 to the west of tw was clearly shown by interferometry of red - shifted highly excited quasi - thermal  line emission ( ) and a compact continuum source was found at this position ( ) . however",
    ", highly excited lines and the continuum did not indicate the presence of molecular material to the east of the tw object where the strongest water masers reside .    in the paper by sutton",
    "( 2004 ) it is shown that the tw object is surrounded by a dense envelope of molecular gas . this surrounding gas obscures the source interiors",
    ". however , doppler shifted internal objects can display themselves in the line wings .",
    "we have searched for such emission in the wings of the strong low excitation lines of the methanol line quartet at 96.7 ghz . because the lines are blended , we examined the blue wing of the 96.74458 ghz line and the red wing of the 96.73939 ghz line .",
    "results of the search are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we found the source to the west of tw in the red wing emission and found evidence of the existence of the blue - shifted methanol emission from the water maser site situated about 1@xmath6 east of tw .",
    "the later fact is also interesting from the chemical point of view because it shows that the water masers are formed in the methanol abundant region .",
    "so , masers have prompted the detection of quasi - thermal  line emission which can provide a clue for elucidating the nature of one of the most intriguing objects of early massive star formation .",
    "east of the tw .",
    "the lower row of panels corresponds to the red wing of the 96.73939 ghz line and displays the embedded source to the west of the tw .",
    "the interferometer beam is shown in the lower left corner of the leftmost upper panel . ]",
    "this paper provides an example of how combined analysis of the interferometry data on the maser and quasi - thermal  lines helps to elucidate the structural , physical and chemical status of the regions of massive star formation .",
    "data on sets of both maser and quasi - thermal  lines allows estimates of the temperature , density , molecular abundances and source extensions and shapes .",
    "we find that the numerous methanol transitions form a good basis for such types of studies both from the point of view of their high diagnostic capacity and because relevant lines are rather easy to observe with existing and forthcoming radioastronomical facilities .",
    "we have also shown that information on quasi - thermallines can reveal the existence of masing objects while the masers can prompt the detection of molecular material emitting in quasi - thermallines .",
