    "due to progress in nano- and material science , the study of wave propagation and electron transport in periodic one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems has attracted much attention ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the systems of particular interest are bi - layer structures in optics and electromagnetics , or semiconductor superlattices and arrays of alternating quantum wells and barriers in electronics .",
    "the interest to this subject is due to a possibility to create structures with prescribed properties of transmission and/or reflection .",
    "new perspectives in this direction are related to unconventional optic properties of metamaterials .",
    "one of the practical problems is the influence of disorder that can not be avoided in real experiments .",
    "the disorder can be originated from fluctuations of the thickness of layers ( _ positional disorder _ ) or from variations of the medium parameters , such as permittivity and permeability for electromagnetic waves or the barrier height for electrons ( _ compositional disorder _ ) .",
    "typically , the disorder is treated as an unwanted effect , however , recently it was understood that it can be a promising candidate for targeted manipulation of transport properties .",
    "indeed , the correlations in the disorder may result in unusual features of transport .",
    "in particular , it was shown , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that specific long - range correlations can significantly enhance or suppress the wave localization in a desired window of frequency .",
    "as is well known , the transmission through any 1d disordered system is governed by anderson localization ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the principal concept of this phenomenon is that all transport characteristics depend solely on the ratio @xmath7 between the structure length @xmath8 and _ localization length _",
    "@xmath3 of eigenstates .",
    "such a universal dependence manifests itself , for example , in the famous expression for the self - averaging logarithm of the transmittance @xmath9 , @xmath10 here , the angular brackets @xmath11 stand for averaging over the disorder . in agreement with the concept of single parameter scaling , there are only two characteristic regimes in 1d disordered structures , namely , the regimes of ballistic and localized transport .",
    "the ballistic transport occurs when the localization length @xmath3 is much larger than the sample length @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the samples are practically fully transparent since its average transmittance is close to unity , @xmath12 in the opposite case when @xmath3 is much smaller than @xmath8 , the 1d disordered structures exhibit localized transport . in this case",
    "the average transmittance is exponentially small , @xmath13 as one can see , in the localization regime a 1d disordered system perfectly ( with an exponential accuracy ) reflects quantum or classical waves because of strong localization of all eigenstates .",
    "this brief analysis shows how one can control the transport by manipulating the value of localization length in comparison with the system size .    in spite of a remarkable progress in understanding the main features of the wave ( electron ) propagation through random structures ,",
    "the majority of studies are based on numerical methods @xcite . giving the important results the numerical approaches obviously suffer from the lack of generality being restricted by specific values of parameters . as for the analytical results , they are",
    "mainly refer to simplest models with white - noise disorder @xcite or to the correlated disorder with _ delta - like _ potentials in the anderson @xcite or kronig - penney models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the 1d models with periodic - on - average bi - layered structures with weakly disordered parameters . in comparison with refs .   where the case of random thicknesses of slabs was considered , here we focus on the model with weakly disordered refractive indices of both slabs .",
    "the main attention is paid to the comparison between normal stacks ( when both layers are of normal material ) and mixed stacks ( with alternating normal and meta - material layers ) .",
    "first , we review the recent study of the structures with different thicknesses of two basic layers @xcite . here",
    "we derive the unique analytical expression for the localization length @xmath3 , which is valid in a large range of model parameters , and can be applied to various physical realizations .",
    "the key point of our approach is that we explicitly take into account possible correlations within two disorders of each layer type as well as between them .",
    "second , we extend our analytical analysis to the particular case of equal thicknesses of basic layers , see ref .  .",
    "we show that in this specific case the standard perturbation theory fails if one of two basic stacks is made from a left - handed material .",
    "specifically , the localization length diverges in the conventional second order in perturbation parameters , thus leading to anomalous properties of scattering .",
    "the model describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves of frequency @xmath14 along an infinite array of two alternating @xmath4 and @xmath5 layers .",
    "every kind of slabs is respectively specified by the dielectric permittivity @xmath15 , magnetic permeability @xmath16 , corresponding refractive index @xmath17 , impedance @xmath18 and wave number @xmath19 .",
    "we consieder two cases : ( a ) when both @xmath4 and @xmath5 slabs consist of a right - handed ( rh ) optic materials , and ( b ) when @xmath4 slabs are of rh - material and @xmath5 layers are of left - handed ( lh ) material . in",
    "what follows , the combination of rh - rh slabs is referred to the _ homogeneous _ stack whereas the array of rh - lh layers is called _ mixed _ stack .    as is known , for the rh medium all optic parameters are positive . on the contrary , for the lh material",
    "the permittivity , permeability and corresponding refractive index are negative , however the impedance remains positive .",
    "every alternating slab has the constant thickness @xmath0 or @xmath1 , respectively , so that the size @xmath20 of the unit @xmath21 cell is also constant , @xmath22 .    as was noted in ref .",

    "thus , one can expect that for mixed rh - lh bi - layer stacks with the specific condition @xmath6 , the dependence of the lyapunov exponent on the model parameters has to be highly non - trivial .",
    "this fact can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fnt - fig04 ] which shows how the dependence of the lyapunov exponent on frequency @xmath14 is affected by the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .     with the variance of disorder @xmath174 and sequence length @xmath126 .",
    "the data are obtained with an ensemble averaging over 100 realizations of disorder ; a ) mixed rh - lh array with @xmath6 , b ) the same for @xmath175 , c ) the same for @xmath176 , d ) homogeneous rh - rh array with @xmath6 . for comparison ,",
    "the dot - dashed lines show two frequencies dependencies discussed in the text . ]",
    "the data in this figure clearly display that when @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 , the standard dependence @xmath177 that is known to be a generic case for small @xmath14 , alternates by a very unusual dependence @xmath178 .",
    "the latter result was found numerically in ref .   and later on ,",
    "was discussed in refs .  .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fnt - fig04 ] one can also see that for the homogeneous rh - rh stack - structure the conventional dependence remains valid even in the specific case of @xmath6 .",
    "as was shown above , in this case the lyapunov exponent @xmath97 is described by the generic expression that for homogeneous rh - rh array is valid for any relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent can be derived according to definition and exact hamiltonian map for the radius @xmath91 .",
    "its expansion within the second order of approximation in the disorder @xmath104 gives @xmath179 the averaging in this expression has to be performed with the distribution function @xmath142 determined by eqs .   and .",
    "since the denominator @xmath160 in eq",
    ".   is the same as the coefficient in eq .",
    ", we come to the remarkable result that the lyapunov exponent vanishes for any value of the phase shift @xmath170 !",
    "this means that in order to derive the non - vanishing lyapunov exponent , one has to obtain the expressions for both the phase distribution @xmath142 and the ratio @xmath180 in the next order of perturbation , by expanding them up to the fourth order in disorder which is not a simple task .",
    "thus , one can expect that the lyapunov exponent for the ideal mixed rh - lh stack with @xmath6 , should be proportional to @xmath181 in contrast with the conventional quadratic dependence , @xmath182 .",
    "our extensive numerical and analytical studies confirm this expectation .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of prof .",
