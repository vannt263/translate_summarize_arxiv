    "an important open question in classical general relativity is the nature of the singularities that form in generic gravitational collapse .",
    "the singularity theorems of penrose @xcite , hawking @xcite , and others @xcite prove that some type of singular behavior must arise in generic gravitational collapse of reasonable matter .",
    "however , these theorems do not provide a description of the singular behavior that results .",
    "many different types of singular behavior arise in known solutions to einstein s equations . however , known explicit solutions tend to be characterized by simplifying symmetries .",
    "this means that singular behavior found in such examples need not be characteristic of those of generic collapse . in the 1960 s , belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl )",

    ", work has begun aimed at understanding the singularity and the approach to it in spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite .",
    "if einstein s equations are truncated by ignoring all terms with spatial derivatives and keeping all terms with time derivatives ( for some more or less natural choice of spacetime slicing ) , the velocity term dominated ( vtd ) solutions are found .",
    "if an inhomogeneous spacetime is asymptotically vtd ( avtd ) , the evolution toward the singularity at ( almost ) every spatial point comes arbitrarily close to one of the vtd solutions @xcite .",
    "it has been proven that polarized gowdy cosmologies @xcite and more general polarized @xmath3-symmetric models @xcite are avtd @xcite .",
    "the main extra feature in generic gowdy models compared to polarized ones is the presence of two nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian which yields the dynamical einstein equations . in an avtd spacetime , these must become exponentially small as the singularity is approached .",
    "but this requrement is only consistent with the form of the vtd solution if a spatially dependent parameter of the vtd solution lies in a restricted range at ( almost ) every spatial point .",
    "the numerical studies demonstrate that the nonlinear terms act as potentials to drive the parameter into the consistent range @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been proven that generic gowdy solutions with a consistent value of this parameter are avtd @xcite .",
    "recently , weaver et al @xcite have extended the gowdy model by inclusion of a magnetic field ( and change of spatial topology from @xmath4 to the solv - twisted torus @xcite ) .",
    "this model is an inhomogeneous generalization of the magnetic bianchi vi@xmath5 homogeneous cosmology which is known to exhibit mixmaster behavior @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field causes a third nonlinear term to be present .",
    "this term grows for precisely that range of vtd parameter which makes the original two vacuum gowdy nonlinear terms exponentially small .",

    "numerical simulations have previously provided strong support for the predicted avtd singularity in polarized @xmath0 models @xcite . here",
    "we shall discuss the support we have obtained for the local oscillatory nature of the singularity in generic @xmath0 models .",
    "unlike all previous cases discussed in this program @xcite , numerical difficulties require an introduction of spatial averaging ( data smoothing ) at each time step to prevent numerical instability .",
    "this averaging destroys convergence of the solution with increasing spatial resolution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the need for spatial averaging can be traced to the growth of spiky features first seen and discussed in the gowdy models @xcite .",
    "these features also ( as the bounces in mixmaster itself @xcite ) make it necessary to explicitly enforce the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "if this is not done , qualitatively incorrect behavior will result .",
    "we shall argue in this paper that , despite the need for spatial averaging and our simple algebraic method of enforcement of only the hamiltonian constraint , the qualitative behavior of the numerical simulations is correct .",
    "we believe we have demonstrated that the singularity in generic @xmath0 symmetric cosmologies is spacelike , local , and oscillatory .",
    "evidence for this is that the oscillations and their correlation with the exponential growth of certain nonlinear terms in einstein s equations are independent of spatial resolution and choice of initial data .",

    "possible inconsistencies could arise from the nonlinear terms in ( [ hu1 ] ) containing exponential factors .",
    "these same exponentials would , of course , be present in einstein s equations .",
    "we first notice that the gowdy - like terms @xcite @xmath43 in @xmath44 become , in the limit of @xmath32 , upon substitution of ( [ u1avtd ] ) @xmath45 and are exponentially small only if @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "( as in the gowdy case @xcite , non - generic behavior can arise at isolated spatial points where @xmath26 and/or @xmath20 vanish . )",
    "the complicated terms in @xmath48 containing the spatial derivatives have only two types of exponential behavior .",
    "all but one of the terms in @xmath49 have a factor @xmath50 ( if we assume @xmath46 , all components of @xmath51 are dominated by @xmath52 ) which becomes @xmath53 in the vtd limit .",
    "the remaining term is @xmath54 which becomes upon substitution of ( [ u1avtd ] ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is some function .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath15 in ( [ u1vlamlim ] ) and ( [ u1v2lim ] ) are restricted by the vtd form of the hamiltonian constraint ( as @xmath32 ) @xmath57 obtained by substitution of ( [ u1avtd ] ) into ( [ h0 ] ) . as discussed in @xcite , ( [ u1havtd ] ) implies that @xmath58 so that ( [ u1vlamlim ] ) decays exponentially for @xmath46 for any @xmath35 . on the other hand , for @xmath59 to become exponentially small with @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath60 , we require @xmath61 which is inconsistent with ( [ u1havtd ] ) .",
    "since there is no way to make @xmath62 and @xmath59 both exponentially small with the same value of @xmath35 , the mcp predicts that either @xmath62 or @xmath59 will always grow exponentially .",
    "( again , non - generic behavior can result at isolated spatial points where the coefficient of @xmath59 happens to vanish . )    to refine this prediction , consider @xmath63 .",
    "substitution in ( [ u1havtd ] ) yields @xmath64 which shows that @xmath65 thus we expect @xmath62 and @xmath59 to act as potentials for the @xmath8 degree of freedom with a bounce off either potential causing the sign of @xmath35 to change .",
    "the remaining variables will follow the vtd solution with parameters which change at every bounce in @xmath8 .",
    "thus we predict that oscillations in the @xmath8 degree of freedom will occur at ( almost ) every spatial point with different values of @xmath35 and coefficients of @xmath62 and @xmath59 .",
    "note that in polarized @xmath0 models , @xmath66 so that the oscillations of ( [ vphidep ] ) should be absent .",
    "polarized @xmath0 models should thus be avtd .",
    "this is precisely what has been found in numerical simulations of these models @xcite .",
    "in order to test the predictions of the previous section , we performed numerical simulations of the einstein evolution equations obtained from the variation of ( [ hu1 ] ) .",
    "we use a symplectic pde solver which has been described in great detail elsewhere @xcite . in our previous study of polarized @xmath0 models",
    ", we demonstrated convergence of the solutions at the expected order with increasing spatial resolution .",
    "unfortunately , the re - introduction of the @xmath19 degree of freedom leads to the growth of spiky features absent in the polarized case .",
    "the origin of the spiky features is discussed elsewhere @xcite but is related to the non - generic behavior at isolated spatial points .",
    "the spiky features which our methods easily treat in one spatial dimension @xcite can not be modeled sufficiently well in two spatial dimensions to prevent numerical instability .",
    "however , these instabilities can be suppressed in two ways .",
    "first , the simulations are begun at @xmath67 or so to reduce the influence of @xmath49 from ( [ hu1 ] ) .",
    "( this has the disadvantage , as in homogeneous mixmaster spacetimes @xcite , of increasing the time interval between bounces . )",
    "second , at every time step , all ten variables are replaced by their spatial `` average . '' any function @xmath68 is replaced by @xcite @xmath69\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the grid spacings .",
    "this scheme is 6th order accurate ( i.e. the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath68 is 7th order in the grid spacings  actually 8th order due to symmetry ) .",
    "where @xmath68 is smooth , the averaging has no effect .",
    "however , it does spread out grid scale size spiky features .",
    "unfortunately , the averaging process destroys the convergence seen in the polarized case ( by examination of the deviation of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints from zero @xcite ) , as can be determined by adding averaging to polarized @xmath0 simulations .",
    "we shall argue later that despite the absence of convergence in this sense , the qualitative behavior is still independent of spatial resolution .",
    "we shall further argue that the correct qualitative behavior is sufficent to determine the nature of the singularity in generic @xmath0 models .    in section",
    "ii , we showed that the behavior of the potentials in @xmath49 was restricted by the vtd limit of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ u1havtd ] ) .",
    "this means that it is essential to preserve the hamiltonian constraint during the simulation .",
    "failure to preserve @xmath79 means that @xmath28 would have the _",
    "wrong _ dependence on @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "this could change the sign of the coefficient of @xmath15 in ( [ u1v2lim ] ) . while solving the constraints",
    "initially is sufficient analytically , there is no way to guarantee that the differenced form of the constraints is preserved during a numerical simulation of the einstein evolution equations .",
    "while in the polarized @xmath0 case , the constraints can be seen to converge to zero @xcite , this is no longer true in generic @xmath0 simulations with spatial averaging . to preserve the correct relationships among @xmath42 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 from ( [ u1havtd ] )",
    ", we therefore solve @xmath80 ( [ h0 ] ) for @xmath81 algebraically at each time step .",
    "we note that this is the precise analog of the procedure used in mixmaster itself @xcite .",
    "however , spatial averaging must be performed on this new @xmath28 which then yields a ( small ) non - zero value for @xmath82 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath83 is the measured value , then ( [ u1havtd ] ) can be linearized in the error @xmath84 and solved to yield @xmath85 where @xmath82 is the measured , erroneous value of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "substitution in @xmath86 , the coefficient of @xmath15 in @xmath59 , yields a measured and true value for @xmath87 .",
    "if the product @xmath88 is positive everywhere for all @xmath15 , the errors due to averaging can not have changed the qualitative behavior since that just depends on the sign of @xmath87 .",
    "examination of the simulation data shows @xmath89 at ( almost ) all spacetime points . occasionally , early in the simulation , a few isolated points  in space and time ",
    "will show a sign change due to this error .    the momentum constraints ( [ hu ] ) and ( [ hv ] ) are freely evolved and do not remain especially small .",
    "however , they contain only spatial derivatives .",
    "errors in the momentum constraints would therefore generate errors in the spatial dependence of the variables at a given time but not in their qualitative time dependence at each spatial point .",
    "a measure of the constraint convergence vs @xmath15 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the freely evolved @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) is actually larger at finer spatial resolution .",
    "this may be attributed to the larger spatial gradients observed at finer spatial resolution @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the error in the hamiltonian constraint is converging to zero .",
    "the restricted initial value solution for generic @xmath0 models has been described elsewhere @xcite . to solve the momentum constraints , we set @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for @xmath94 sufficiently large ,",
    "this allows the hamiltonian constraint to be solved algebraically for @xmath25 ( case a ) or @xmath20 ( case b ) .",
    "four functions , @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath20 ( case a ) or @xmath25 ( case b ) , may be freely specified .",
    "the detailed values used in the numerical simulations are given in the figure captions .",
    "while we shall present results for only two sets of initial data , the results are typical of all initial data and may be regarded to be characteristic of generic initial data .",
    "figures 2 - 4 show the behavior of @xmath8 , @xmath62 , and @xmath59 for three spatial resolutions for case a initial data . in all cases ,",
    "the behavior is exactly as predicted in section ii .",
    "figure 5 shows a typical evolution for case b initial data , again showing the predicted behavior .",
    "for the simulation of figure 3 , the remaining variables @xmath19 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 vs @xmath15 are shown at the same spatial point in figure 6 . here",
    "we see approximate vtd behavior in @xmath19 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 with parameters changing at the times of the @xmath8 bounces .",
    "while the behavior of @xmath11 does not appear to be as predicted , we note from ( [ u1avtd ] ) , ( [ u1vlam ] ) , and ( [ u1v2 ] ) that only the behaviors of @xmath10 and @xmath12 are important to the local dynamics since only they appear in the arguments of exponentials .",
    "finally , we display `` movie frames '' of @xmath95 and @xmath96 vs @xmath15 in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "since @xmath49 is shown on a logarithmic scale and @xmath8 on a linear one , figure 7 is dominated by @xmath59 while figure 8 indicates the behavior on a logarithmic scale of @xmath62 . the predicted behavior that either @xmath62 or @xmath59 but not both be large is clearly seen in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "the bounces in @xmath8 occur at different spatial points at different times .",
    "this eventually will lead to increasingly complex spatial structure @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of generic @xmath0 models demonstrate that the evolution toward the singularity is local and oscillatory due to the alternate expoential growth and decay of @xmath62 and @xmath59 .",
    "this behavior requires that the time dependence of the coefficients of @xmath62 and @xmath59 and the coefficients of @xmath15 in the approximate forms of @xmath62 and @xmath59 be negligible ( i.e.  act on a much slower time scale ) compared to the exponential time dependence obtained from the vtd solution .",
    "the qualitative behavior seen in the simulations indicates that this requirement is met ( almost ) everywhere sufficiently close to the singularity .",
    "exceptional behavior at isolated spatial points similar to that found in simpler models @xcite can not be studied with the current numerical code .",
    "exceptional behavior arises at isolated spatial points because one of the exponential potentials which causes the generic behavior is absent . while we believe we have identified the correct exponential behavior , the data we have on spatial dependence at a given time is probably not sufficiently reliable for conclusions about `` higher order '' effects .",
    "the explanation for the local nature of the evolution is easy to obtain . from the metric ( [ metric ] )",
    ", we see that the distance @xmath97 traveled by a light ray away from the singularity from @xmath98 to @xmath99 ( coordinate horizon size ) is @xmath100 where the vtd limit of @xmath51 has been used .",
    "simulations demonstrate that the vtd solution may be used in ( [ horizon ] ) to give @xmath101 for the coordinate horizon size @xcite as @xmath102 . since the horizon size is decreasing , the spatial points are unable to communicate with each other .",
    "but such communication occurs through changing spatial derivatives . if no communication can occur",
    ", the spatial derivative containing terms must be dynamically unimportant .",
    "the primary question then is the extent to which the numerical results presented here are believable as evidence for the oscillatory nature of the singularity .",
    "it is easy to show , e.g.  by comparing polarized @xmath0 simulations with and without spatial averaging , that spatial averaging ruins convergence tests .",
    "furthermore , non - zero values of the momentum constraints ( [ hu ] ) and ( [ hv ] ) indicate the presence of errors in the variables and their spatial derivatives .",
    "( since rescaling the coordinates by a constant yields rescaled values of the constraints without changing the behavior of the solutions , one can not attach any significance to the actual magnitude of the constraint violation . )",
    "both sources of error  spatial averaging and constraint violation  principally affect details of the spatial dependence of the variables at a given time .",
    "comparison of simulations at different spatial resolutions ( and with quite different initial data ) shows that the qualitative time dependence at fixed spatial points is not affected by these errors .",
    "this is shown in figure 9 where @xmath8 is shown on a line @xmath103 with @xmath104 $ ] vs @xmath15 for three different spatial resolutions .",
    "while the features appear narrower at finer spatial resolution ( see @xcite for a similar phenomenon in gowdy models ) , the time development of the simulations is remarkably consistent and independent of resolution .",
    "figure 10 shows the final time step for @xmath8 for two different spatial resolutions . while the spatial dependence is quantitatively different , it is qualitatively quite similar .",
    "we also see in figures 11 and 12 , that the correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath59 seen at single spatial points in figures 2 - 6 occurs everywhere .",
    "figure 11 shows @xmath105 and @xmath106 on the line @xmath103 with @xmath107 $ ] vs @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , one potential grows as the other decays at all spatial points .",
    "figure 12 shows the final time step for @xmath62 , @xmath59 , and @xmath8 on the line @xmath103 with @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "given this same oscillatory behavior in all the simulations and the explanation for it in terms of the vtd solution given in section ii , it is proabable that we have correctly described the nature of the generic singularity in this class of models .",
    "this does not mean that it is unimportant to improve the numerical treatment .",
    "better numerics will yield more accurate spatial dependence of the metric variables .",
    "we expect to see ever narrowing spatial structure as in gowdy @xcite and magnetic gowdy @xcite models caused by non - generic values at isolated spatial points . this can also yield precise data for analysis of the local dynamics to characterize the `` higher order '' effects due to spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "it might also become possible to observe and characterize any other exceptional behavior that might arise at isolated spatial points .",
    "there are several possibilities for numerical improvement .",
    "first among these is to incorporate into the algorithm the fact that a known explicit solution exists for the bounce ( scattering ) off an exponential potential .",
    "the symplectic algorithm divides the hamiltonian for a system into two or more subhamiltonians with explicit exact solutions for their equations of motion .",
    "the standard division of @xmath48 is into kinetic ( @xmath108 ) and potential ( @xmath109 ) pieces . including a dominant exponential wall from @xmath109 in @xmath108 has yielded tens of orders of magnitude of improvement in speed while maintaining machine level precision in the ode s of spatially homogeneous mixmaster models @xcite .",
    "the current @xmath0 code uses @xmath44 and @xmath49 ( [ hu1 ] ) as the subhamiltonians .",
    "however , one could treat @xmath110 or @xmath111 as a separate subhamiltonian depending on which of @xmath62 , @xmath59 is the larger .",
    "the absence of @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath20 from ( [ hphi1 ] ) means that the equations from @xmath112 are exactly solvable ( as , obviously are those from @xmath113 ) .",
    "while in the ode case , the main advantage was found in the ability to take huge time steps , for the @xmath0 case , it will be the improved accuracy of the bounce solution .",
    "another area of improvement is in spatial differencing .",
    "the current code uses 4th and 6th order accurate representations of first and second derivatives due to norton @xcite .",
    "these are designed to minimize the growth of grid scale wavelength instabilities . however , when applied to the gowdy model , this scheme appears to be less stable than the original one @xcite based on variation of a differenced form of the hamiltonian .",
    "we also note that spectral methods have been tried but have not proven to be useful . a third place for numerical improvement would be to solve all three constraints rather than just the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "of course , one naturally wonders if adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) might yield improvements in accuracy and stability .",
    "studies to date have shown that increasing spatial resolution yields only small improvements in stability .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that finer resolution only gives better representation of spiky features  showing them to be narrower and steeper than they appear at coarser resolution . in the gowdy simulations , however ,",
    "it was noticed that , for any given simulation , there is a threshold spatial resolution .",
    "if the resolution is coarser than that , the code will blow up before the avtd regime is reached everywhere .",
    "it is therefore possible that we have not yet reached this threshold in the @xmath0 case and thus would be helped by amr .",
    "however , in the generic @xmath0 models , there is no avtd regime .",
    "thus it is not clear if any spatial resolution could yield a simulation which could run indefinitely without crashing .    as a final note",
    ", we remark that the local nature of the @xmath0 evolution ( as well as the other cases we have studied ) has two major implications :    \\(1 ) the use of cosmological boundary conditions is merely a convenience since they do not affect the local behavior .",
    "any collapse of a system with one spatial killing field to a spacelike singularity should be local and oscillatory .",
    "\\(2 ) qualitative answers on the nature of the singularity do not require fine spatial resolutions .",
