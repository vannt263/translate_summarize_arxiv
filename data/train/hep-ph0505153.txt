    "the physics community has been puzzled since the nutev collaboration reported the anomaly that the value : @xmath5 , which was measured in deep inelastic scattering  ( dis ) of ( anti-)neutrino from the nuclear target with possible uncertainties and errors having been considered  @xcite , is deviated from the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "the weinberg angle ( or weak angle ) @xmath6 is one of the important quantities in the electroweak theory , and can be determined from various experimental methods , such as atomic parity violation , @xmath7 and @xmath8 masses , elastic and inelastic neutrino scattering , and so on . at present , the world accepted value is @xmath9 .",
    "the nutev collaboration measured the value of @xmath2 by using the ratio of ( anti-)neutrino neutral - current to charged - current cross sections on iron  @xcite , which is closely related to the paschos - wolfenstein  ( p - w ) relation  @xcite : @xmath10 the validity of this relation is based on the fundamental assumptions of isoscalar target , charge symmetry and strange symmetry @xmath11 , which give rise to a large number of theoretical and experimental investigations on this issue .",
    "possible sources of the nutev anomaly beyond the sm have been discussed  @xcite . however , before speculating on the possible new physics , one should first check carefully the _ standard _ effect and the theoretical uncertainties within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .    here , we make a broad review of the main mechanisms which have been used to investigate the nutev anomaly .",
    "the p - w relation holds for a nuclear target provided that the nucleus is in the isoscalar state , which means that various strong interaction effects must cancel out in the ratio .",
    "but the actual targets used in the neutrino experiments are usually non - isoscalar nuclei with a significant neutron excess , such as the iron target in the nutev experiment .",
    "kumano  @xcite investigated a conventional explanation in terms of a nuclear modification caused by the difference between the @xmath12- and @xmath13-valence distributions when the charge and baryon - number conservation for nuclei are considered .",
    "he and his collaborators estimated this effect to the nutev @xmath2 value by using a @xmath14 analysis method to reproduce nuclear data on the structure function @xmath15 and the cross - section of drell - yan processes , and noticed that the effect is not large enough to explain the whole nutev anomaly in their later work  @xcite . and",
    "kulagin  @xcite not only took into account the neutron excess correction to the p - w relation for a neutron - rich target , but also discussed other corrections to the p - w relation caused by other nuclear effects : the fermi motion , nuclear binding , nuclear shadowing , etc .",
    "in addition , nuclear effects were completely estimated and the shift to the nutev anomaly was given with some uncertainties in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a particular nuclear @xmath16-rescaling model to describe the structure functions in ( anti-)neutrino - nucleus dis .",
    "also , there are other suggestions  @xcite from a conservative point of views .",
    "another fundamental assumption is charge symmetry which is a more restricted form of isospin invariance involving a rotation of @xmath17 about the  2 \" axis in isospin space , or more specifically , the isospin symmetry for the @xmath18 exchanges between protons and neutrons  @xcite .",
    "however , there have been some discussions about the correction to the p - w relation due to this symmetry breaking .",
    "sather  @xcite first pointed out that the charge symmetry violation  ( csv ) should largely affect the extraction of @xmath2 from the neutrino collision and gave an estimation about it .",
    "the similar result was given in ref .",
    "@xcite that csv effect should reduce about one - third of the discrepancy between the nutev result and the accepted average value of @xmath2 . on the contrary , cao and signal",
    "@xcite calculated the nonperturbative effect of csv within the meson cloud model framework and showed no contribution to the nutev anomaly . at this stage , we still have no direct experimental evidences to point to a substantial violation of cs in parton distributions . only there are some up limits in experiment for the csv , because the effect of csv usually confuses with the asymmetry of @xmath19 and @xmath20 distributions",
    ".    the asymmetry of strange and antistrange quark distributions may imply an additional source for the anomaly .",
    "the topic of strange content in the nucleon sea is one of the most challenging issues in the hadron physics , especially for its connection to the proton spin problem and to the nutev anomaly . for the part of nucleon sea generated through gluon",
    "splitting @xmath21 in perturbative qcd , cp symmetry is expected in the quark and antiquark distributions in the leading order .",
    "it has been argued recently that there is a strange - antistrange asymmetry in perturbative qcd at three - loop  @xcite , however , the perturbative qcd alone definitely predicts a non - vanishing and @xmath22-dependent value of strange - antistrange asymmetry which would have a very small contribution to the extraction of @xmath2 .",
    "so the cause of a sizable asymmetry of the nucleon strange sea should be of nonperturbative origin  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is highly probable that the momentum distributions of strange and antistrange are different in the nucleon sea , although the total number of strange quark and antiquark occurring as quantum fluctuations must be precisely equal to conserve the strangeness quantum number .",
    "the consequence on the nutev anomaly from possible asymmetry of strange and antistrange quark distributions in the nucleon sea was examined by cao and signal  @xcite utilizing the meson cloud model  @xcite and the result is fairly small and has no significant effect on the nutev result .",
    "oppositely , it was shown  @xcite that the light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model proposed by brodsky and ma  @xcite can describe the second moment @xmath23\\textmd{d}x$ ] and produce an asymmetry of @xmath24 and @xmath25 distributions which could remove roughly 30 - 80% of the discrepancy between the nutev result and other determination of @xmath2 . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymmetric @xmath26 distribution treated in a different framework of non - perturbative hadronic @xmath27 fluctuations is found to reduce the nutev result to only about 2 standard deviations from sm , while the realistic behavior of the strange sea distribution @xmath28/2 $ ] is also reasonably reproduced .",
    "kretzer @xmath29",
    "@xcite obtained qcd correction by calculating the next - to - leading - order  ( nlo ) neutrino cross sections and studied the shift of @xmath2 which is closely correlated with @xmath30 parton distribution function sets and isospin violation with some uncertainties .",
    "it is also noticed that the contribution to the nutev anomaly changes sign from  @xmath31 \" to  @xmath32 \" when @xmath33 is calculated  @xcite by using the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "a more reliable theoretical analysis in the chiral quark model has been give in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it is shown that the nutev anomaly can be accounted for by at least 60% without sensitivity to the inputs of constituent quark distributions and cut - off parameters .",
    "recently , wakamatsu  @xcite gave also a theoretical analysis based on the flavor su(3 ) chiral quark soliton model by introducing a parameter of the effective mass difference between strange and nonstrange quarks and predicted a fairly large asymmetry of @xmath19- and @xmath20-quark distributions which would solely resolve the nutev anomaly , in similar to the conclusion in ref .",
    "in addition , szczurek @xmath29  @xcite discussed more earlier the dressing of constituent quark with a pseudoscalar meson cloud within the effective chiral quark model by including the effect of su(3)@xmath34 symmetry violation explicitly .",
    "they found more pions and kaons in the nucleon than what predicted by traditional meson cloud model and pointed out that the effective chiral quark model may lead to a sizeable asymmetric strangeness content of the nucleon sea .    as we know that the nucleon sea has received attention for a long time because of the abundant phenomena which are away from the naive theoretical expectations .",
    "for example , the gottfried sum rule  ( gsr )  @xcite violation is related to the light - flavor antiquark asymmetry in the nucleon sea and has been measured in several experiments . at the same time , there are some models , such as : the meson cloud model  @xcite in which the relative success was obtained in both the difference and the ratio of @xmath35 and @xmath36 by including the perturbative component ; pauli blocking effect which first suggested by field and feynman  @xcite ; and several different types of chiral models and so on , proposed to explain the violation of gottfried sum rule . and another case is the proton spin crisis  @xcite and its connection to the strange content in the nucleon sea  @xcite . usually , the distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are assumed to be symmetric , but this is neither proved theoretically nor experimentally .",
    "moreover , some measurements and analyses  @xcite show that the distributions of strange and antistrange quark may be asymmetric .",
    "a joint fit  @xcite to the neutrino charged - current cross sections  @xcite and charged lepton structure function data was made by the cdhs collaboration and some improvements were achieved in the fits if asymmetry in the strange sea was allowed .    in this paper , we present the more detailed calculation of the asymmetric distributions for both the light - flavor antiquarks @xmath37 and @xmath38 and the strange content in the nucleon sea by using the effective chiral quark model along with our previous work  @xcite , and find that the distributions of @xmath0 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath4 match well with the experimental data , when additional symmetric sea contributions being considered effectively by taking into account the difference between model results and data parametrization . furthermore , it is should be pointed out that the asymmetry of @xmath24 and @xmath25 distributions could remove roughly the nutev anomaly by at least 60% , and it is more remarkable that this conclusion is insensitive to the different inputs of the effective chiral quark model .",
    "the effective chiral quark model , established by weinberg  @xcite , and developed by manohar and georgi  @xcite , has been widely accepted by the hadron physics society as an effective theory of qcd at low energy scale .",
    "the effective chiral quark model has an apt description of its important degrees of freedom in terms of quarks , gluons and goldstone  ( gs ) bosons at momentum scales relating to hadron structure .",
    "there has been a prevailing impression that the effective chiral quark model is successful in explaining the violation of gsr ( which was first detected by the new muon collaboration at cern  @xcite ) by the analysis of eichten , hinchliffe and quigg  @xcite .",
    "also , this model plays an important role in explaining the proton spin crisis  @xcite by cheng and li  @xcite . a recent study by us  @xcite shows that the strange - antistrange asymmetry within the effective chiral quark model could explain the nutev anomaly also .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a more detailed analysis on the strange - antistrange asymmetry and its connection to the light - flavor sea asymmetry in the effective chiral quark model .    the chiral symmetry at high energy scale and its breaking at low energy scale are the basic properties of qcd .",
    "because the effect of the internal gluons is small in the effective chiral quark model at low energy scale , the gluonic degrees of freedom are negligible when comparing to those of the gs bosons and quarks . in this picture , the valence quarks which are contained in the nucleon fluctuate into quarks plus gs bosons , which spontaneously break chiral symmetry , and any low energy hadron properties should include this symmetry violation . the effective interaction lagrangian is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the quark field and @xmath43 is the gauge - covariant derivative of qcd , with @xmath44 standing for the gluon field , @xmath45 standing for the strong coupling constant and @xmath46 for the axial - vector coupling constant determined from the axial charge of the nucleon . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the vector and axial - vector currents which are defined by the following forms : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 has the form : @xmath52 with the expansion for @xmath47 and @xmath48 in powers of @xmath53 , it gives @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where the pseudoscalar decay constant is @xmath56  mev .",
    "so the effective interaction lagrangian between gs bosons and quarks in the leading order becomes  @xcite @xmath57 the framework that we use in this paper is based on the time - ordered perturbative theory in the infinite momentum frame  ( imf ) . because all particles are on - mass - shell in this frame and the factorization of the subprocess is automatic , we neglect all possible off - mass - shell corrections . in this framework",
    ", we can express the quark distributions inside a nucleon as a convolution of a constituent quark distribution in a nucleon and the structure functions of a constituent quark .",
    "the light - front fock decompositions of constituent quark wave functions have the following forms @xmath58 @xmath59 and the corresponding picture are shown in fig .  [ wavefunction ] .    here",
    ", @xmath8 is the renormalization constant for the bare constituent quarks which are massive and denoted by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the probabilities to find gs bosons in the dressed constituent quark states @xmath63 for an @xmath64 quark and @xmath65 for a @xmath66 quark , where @xmath67 . in the effective chiral quark model ,",

    "the experimental value of gottfried sum is @xmath86  @xcite , which is different from the value 1/3 predicted by the naive parton model in which both the light - flavor sea and the isospin between proton and neutron are su(2 ) symmetric  @xcite . employing the quark distributions of the effective chiral quark model , we get the gottfried sum determined by the difference between proton and neutron structure functions : @xmath87\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{3}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{dx}{x}[u(x)+{\\overline{u}}(x)-d(x)-{\\overline{d}}(x)]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{3}(z-\\frac{1}{2}\\left < p_{\\pi}\\right>+\\left < p_{k}\\right>+\\frac{1}{6}\\left < p_{\\eta}\\right>)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 2\\left < p_{\\pi}\\right>).\\label{gottfried}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from above equation , we gain the values of gottfried sum given in table  [ value ] corresponding to different @xmath88 , from which we can find that the appropriate value for @xmath88 is 1500  mev , when the value of gottfried sum matches well with the experimental data . at the same time , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "the asymmetries of light - flavor antiquark and strange - antistrange distributions originated from the nonperturbative sea have been discussed within the effective chiral quark model .",
    "although the asymmetries of light - flavor antiquark and strange sea content in the nucleon are mainly coming from the intrinsic sea , the extrinsic sea should be also considered from a strict sense when we investigate the distributions of @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . from the calculations , we find that the effective chiral quark model predictions of @xmath0 distributions keep consistence with the experimental data , but the predictions of @xmath3 distributions are not good in matching the experimental data at small and large @xmath16 by using the effective chiral quark model before taking into account additional contribution from the symmetric sea  ( e.g. @xmath98 ) . because the contribution of the symmetric sea effect  ( @xmath98 ) cancels out each other in the distributions of @xmath0 , the distributions of @xmath0 match the experimental data well . for the distributions of @xmath3 , when the symmetric sea content is considered , the distribution of @xmath3 becomes : @xmath99 from the eq .",

    "thus , the distributions of @xmath3 without and with symmetric sea contribution are obtained and shown in fig .",
    "[ dubarr ] . from the figure",
    ", we can find that a large suppression occurs by including the symmetric sea contribution , which implies that the effective chiral quark model only provides a fraction of the total light - flavor in the nucleon , and that a significant fraction of symmetric sea content is required .",
    "this also can be found in fig .",
    "[ xdubarr ] , which displays the comparison of the distributions for @xmath38 and @xmath37 obtained from the parametrization  @xcite and the effective chiral quark model calculations .",
    "the role of the symmetric sea is similar to that by including some isoscalar  ( pseudoscalar ) meson @xmath103  ( @xmath92 ) contribution in the meson cloud model , as pointed in ref .",
    "however , the effective way of taking into account the symmetric sea contribution is not good in reproducing the shape of @xmath3 , and more work both theoretically and experimentally should be done along this direction .    within the effective chiral quark model",
    ", the strange - antistrange asymmetry mainly comes from the @xmath91 meson clouds which accompany the constituent quarks . from the calculations we know that the corrections coming from the strange asymmetry with different inputs of constituent quark distributions are large enough to explain the nutev anomaly .",
    "it is also necessary to mention that the ratio of @xmath4 in the model does not necessarily conflict with the experimental data in fact , because the experimental data include the effect of the intrinsic and extrinsic sea . in this paper , we calculate the ratio of @xmath4 without and with symmetric strange sea contribution , where the symmetric sea contribution is estimated effectively by the difference between @xmath104 from the nutev data parametrization and that in the effective chiral quark model calculation , in similar to what we estimated above for the symmetric light - flavor sea quarks .",

    "[ ssbar ] . from the left one of the figure without the symmetric sea content",
    ", we can see that the ratios are out of the area for errors .",
    "however , the distributions of @xmath4 including the symmetric sea contribution are almost within the range of the experimental errors in the right one .",
    "this case is similar to the @xmath3 distribution and indicates that the effective chiral quark model only provides a fraction of the strange sea content , and that a significant fraction of symmetric strange sea content is still needed .",
    "fortunately , the strange asymmetry of the effective chiral quark model can cause a large reduction of the nutev anomaly , although the asymmetric strange sea is only a small part of the total strange sea content of the nucleon .",
    "in this work , we presented the calculations of the asymmetries of light - flavor sea quark distributions @xmath0 and strange - antistrange @xmath1 within the effective chiral quark model with more details along with our previous work  @xcite by using two different sets of parameterizations as inputs and find that the results for @xmath0 match the experimental measurements well .",
    "the distributions of @xmath3 do not match with the experimental data , but there is a large suppression of the ratio when the symmetric sea contribution is considered .",
    "the contributions of symmetric sea effects are estimated effectively by the difference between the effective chiral quark model results and the data parametrization results .",
    "[ xsplussbar ] and fig .",
    "[ xdubarr ] indicate that the predictions of the effective chiral quark model provide only a fraction of the total light - flavor sea quarks and strange sea content of the nucleon .",
    "also , we point out that the calculated results for @xmath4 in the effective chiral quark model are consistent with the available experiments with an additional symmetric sea contribution being included effectively . more noticeably , the asymmetry of strange - antistrange distributions can bring a significant contribution to the nutev defect by at least 60% with reasonable parameters within this model , and the results are not sensitive to the different inputs of constituent quark distributions , although the intrinsic sea is not the dominant part in the nucleon sea .",
    "the effective chiral quark model is thus successful in explaining the nucleon sea anomalies not only about the gsr violation and the proton spin problem , but also about the nutev defect .",
    "also , this may imply that the nutev anomaly can be considered as a phenomenological support to the strange - antistrange asymmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "so it is more important that more precision experiments should be carried out to enable direct and more accurate determination of strange - antistrange sea quark distributions in the future .",

    "<S> the asymmetries of both light - flavor antiquark @xmath0 and strange - antistrange @xmath1 distributions of the nucleon sea are considered with more details in the effective chiral quark model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymmetric distribution of light - flavor antiquarks @xmath0 matches the experiment data well and that the asymmetry of strange and antistrange distributions can bring about 60 - 100% correction to the nutev anomaly of @xmath2 , which are three standard deviations from the world average value measured in other electroweak processes . </S>",
    "<S> the results on the correction to the nutev anomaly are insensitive to the inputs of the constituent quark distributions and the cut - off parameters </S>",
    "<S> . the ratios of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are also discussed , and it is found that the ratio @xmath4 is compatible with the available experiments with an additional symmetric sea contribution being considered effectively . </S>"
