    "qcd - like theories describing the strong interaction between quarks and gluons are highly involved due to their non - linear field equations .",
    "this statement also applies to qcd - like theories beyond the standard model like theories with technicolor  @xcite or supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore quite often only numerical simulations remain as a tool to study the theory as a whole . here",
    ", one encounters two crucial modifications of the continuum theory to overcome certain problems .",
    "first , the time axis is wick rotated to circumvent the sign problem resulting from a real time .",
    "thus , the yang - mills action is replaced by a euclidean wilson gauge action or a symanzik improved version of it .",
    "furthermore , the dirac operator becomes a hypercubic lattice dirac operator which is a finite dimensional matrix on a lattice of finite volume @xmath0 .",
    "there are several lattice discretizations of the qcd - dirac operator .",
    "to name only the most prominent , the dirac operators of staggered fermions  @xcite , of wilson fermions  @xcite , of twisted mass fermions  @xcite , of overlap fermions  @xcite and of domain wall fermions  @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of a lattice dirac operator is the naive dirac operator on a cubic lattice with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dirac operator of staggered fermions ( without rooting ) is a particular version of the naive dirac operator .",
    "it is the non - degenerate part of the naive dirac operator on a cubic lattice were each direction consists of an even number of lattice sites .",
    "the second problem to be solved in lattice qcd concerns the continuum limit .",
    "it is well - known that the global symmetries of staggered fermions in four dimensions do not necessarily agree with those of the continuum theory for qcd .",
    "for example the theories with two colors and the fermions in the fundamental representations or with arbitrary colors in the adjoint representation have this problem , see  @xcite .",
    "this problem was also found in three  @xcite and in two dimensions  @xcite . especially in two dimensions the reason for the change of the global symmetries was recently analyzed in detail in  @xcite . in the present work we aim at a generalization of this discussion to arbitrary space - time dimensions .",
    "the global symmetries are manifest in the lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator . in the phase of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry the spectral gap is closed and chiral perturbation theory applies .",
    "the order parameter is the chiral condensate @xmath1 which is given by the banks - casher formula  @xcite in terms of the level density @xmath2 of the dirac operator , @xmath3 the order of the limits is crucial .",
    "the banks - casher formula   is only true for dirac operators exhibiting a chiral symmetry . in three dimensions",
    "one has to consider the following condensate @xmath4 note that the expression in terms of the level density is the same in both equations because we assumed for the latter an even number of dynamical quarks .",
    "then , half the number of the quarks contribute a chiral condensates weighted with a plus sign and the other half with a minus sign .    from the expressions   and we recognize that only those eigenvalues of the dirac operator of order @xmath5 are important for the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the corresponding modes are intimately related with those pseudo - scalar mesons whose compton wavelength is larger than the size of the lattice",
    ". then the kinetic modes factorize from the zero - momentum modes  @xcite and can be integrated out .",
    "the remaining effective lagrangian for the zero - momentum modes is shared with gaussian random matrix models  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction was several times numerically verified , for example for the microscopic level density @xmath6 see @xcite .    for a long time",
    "it is known that qcd - like theories may yield different patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking and , hence , different kinds of goldstone bosons , e.g. see  @xcite . in @xcite the symmetry breaking patterns were derived for an arbitrary dimension larger than two . for qcd - like theories in one and two dimensions the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem  @xcite forbids a spontaneous breaking of global symmetries , though two - dimensional theories seem to be at the borderline , see  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite found that the bott - periodicity  @xcite satisfied by the @xmath7-matrices carries over to the symmetry breaking pattern and , thus , to the effective lagrangian for the pseudo - scalar mesons .",
    "a similar classification was also found for topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "all in all there are ten symmetry breaking patterns associated to qcd - like dirac operators .",
    "they correspond to the cartan classification of hermitian random matrices  @xcite and each of these ten random matrix ensembles yields the effective lagrangian of the pseudo - scalar mesons in lowest order .",
    "marrying the two observations that the partition of the lattice and the space - time dimension affect the global symmetries and , hence , the symmetry breaking pattern , one may ask the question what their combined impact is for an arbitrary qcd - like theory . answering",
    "this question is the main task of the present work .",
    "for this purpose we pursue similar ideas as in  @xcite .",
    "we first review the symmetry analysis of the continuum theory  @xcite , in section  [ sec : continuum ] . in this section",
    "we also recall the properties of clifford algebras built up by the @xmath7-matrices and the different kinds of anti - unitary operators which are at the heart of the classification of global symmetries . in section  [ sec : lattice ]",
    "we very briefly review what the naive discretization explicitly looks like and what the corresponding symmetry operations on a lattice are .",
    "especially we discuss the artificial symmetry operations which arise when one or more directions have an even partition of lattice sites .",
    "those additional symmetry operators anti - commute with the lattice dirac operator and build a clifford algebra themselves .",
    "they are the origin for the change of symmetries which is analyzed in section  [ sec : symmetry ] . in section  [ sec : sympat ] we discuss the symmetry breaking patterns and the number of zero modes and in section  [ sec : mc - sim ] we derive an explicit representation of the non - degenerate part of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "this  reduced \" dirac operator is the staggered dirac operator when each direction of the lattice contains an even number of sites .",
    "we also perform lattice simulations in the strong coupling limit and compare it with random matrix ensembles predicted by our analysis .",
    "those comparisons are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the random matrix results employed in these comparisons are recalled in appendix  [ sec : rmt ] . in section  [ sec : conclusio ] we summarize our results and discuss some important implications .",
    "the tables  [ tab : cont - class ] , [ tab : lat - class ] and [ tab : rmt ] shall help to get an overview of the change of symmetries when varying the space - time dimension , the number of directions with an even partition and the representation of the gauge group .",
    "we want to underline that we deal all qcd - like gauge theories on equal footing and do not restrict ourselves to the gauge group @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast to standard literature we do not apply einstein s summation convention throughout the present work because of computational reasons .",

    "the matrix @xmath39 , see eq .  , is a unitary , hermitian matrix which is either symmetric or anti - symmetric depending on the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "the anti - unitary symmetry   has to be combined with the one which might be satisfied by the vector fields @xmath41 .",
    "note that the partial derivatives are anti - hermitian and real , i.e. @xmath42 . also the vector fields @xmath43 are anti - hermitian , i.e. @xmath44 .",

    "[ tab : cont - class ] we also point out the symmetry breaking pattern , the symmetry class via the cartan classification scheme  @xcite , and the random matrix theory describing the infra - red energy spectrum of the dirac operator .",

    "hence we can restrict the discussion about the zero modes on real and quaternion representations .",
    "second , it strongly depends on the dimension @xmath179 of the reduced hilbert space as well as on @xmath128 , the effective dimension reflected by the symmetries of @xmath117 , whether there is a zero mode or not",
    ". therefore we have to go through the four cases @xmath186 with @xmath187 where these zero modes may appear .",
    "first we consider @xmath188 and a real representation of the gauge group or @xmath189 and a quaternion representation .",
    "then we find a symmetry class d when @xmath101 is even , because this symmetry class does not satisfy a chiral symmetry , and when @xmath190 is odd where @xmath191 , with @xmath192 and @xmath193 an odd integer , is the dimension of the representation .",
    "we have @xmath130_2\\leq d$ ] and @xmath194 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 an odd integer .",
    "then the equation @xmath197_2}{2}\\\\ = & \\frac{d+n_{\\rm l}-1}{2}+c_1+b_1 \\end{split}\\ ] ] has to be satisfied to find a zero mode .",
    "however this will only be the case for @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "since we excluded the lattice theory in one dimension because there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking , we conclude that the symmetry class d never shows up for the naive discretization . in other words , when @xmath100 and , thus , @xmath117 are real anti - symmetric matrices they will be always of even dimension ( cartan class b ) regardless what qcd - like lattice gauge theory one considers and which effective dimension @xmath128 we consider .    in the third and fourth case we consider @xmath200 and a real representation of the gauge group or @xmath201 and a quaternion representation .",
    "then , @xmath101 has to be odd because the symmetry class diii exhibits a chiral structure .",
    "for a zero mode the off - diagonal block has to be odd dimensional , i.e. @xmath202 has to be odd . the additional division by to @xmath203 results from the chiral structure of the matrix @xmath117 . we have to solve the equation @xmath197_2 + 1}{2}\\\\ = & \\frac{d+n_{\\rm l}-2}{2}+c_1+b_1 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] this is only satisfied when @xmath204 and @xmath199 because we exclude the one - dimensional case . indeed",
    "this case was found in the simulations performed in @xcite .",
    "apart from this particular case again no generic zero modes will be found for the naive lattice dirac operator .",
    "let summarize the discussion about the zero modes . excluding one- and two - dimensional theories",
    ", all naive lattice dirac operators will never show generic zero modes independently of the representation of the gauge group , of the space - time dimension and of the partition of the lattice .",
    "we summarize the results above in table  [ tab : lat - class ] .",
    "at last we want to derive an explicit representation of the reduced lattice dirac operator @xmath117 which is the staggered dirac operator for @xmath205 . to achieve this",
    "we define the @xmath206 unitary matrices @xmath207 for @xmath208 .",
    "these matrices are hermitian , @xmath209 , and , thus , self - inverse , @xmath210 .",
    "moreover they satisfy @xmath211 the product of the matrices @xmath212 , i.e. @xmath213 will serve as the change of basis we are looking for to identify @xmath117 . we want to emphasize that @xmath214 is not necessarily equal to the unitary matrix @xmath215 from the previous subsections .",
    "especially the charge conjugation operator @xmath121 will be different from @xmath167 after conjugation with @xmath214 though it will be equivalent .",
    "our particular choice for @xmath214 is that the transformed dirac operator @xmath216 will have a simple form where @xmath117 can be readily read off .    for the transformation of the dirac operator we need the commutation relations",
    "@xmath217 again we want to recall that we do not use einstein s summation convention . combining the commutation relations   with eqs .  , , and the dirac operator in the new basis looks as follows @xmath218 we notice that the covariant derivatives in the first @xmath219 directions act trivially in the spinor space .",
    "hence , we may choose a basis of the generalized @xmath7-matrices for @xmath220 in the following way , @xmath221 for @xmath101 being odd and @xmath222 for even @xmath101 .",
    "the matrix @xmath223 is the tensor product of the third pauli matrix taken @xmath224-times .",
    "the matrices @xmath225 build the generalized @xmath7-matrices in @xmath128 dimensions .",
    "the remaining @xmath7-matrices @xmath24 with @xmath226 are then of the form @xmath227 for odd @xmath101 and @xmath228 for even @xmath101 with @xmath229 , but this is not important anymore .",
    "equation   is enough to read off the reduced lattice dirac operator which is @xmath230 with the new covariant derivatives @xmath231 for @xmath226 and @xmath232 for @xmath233 .",
    "we underline that the only difference between eqs .   and",
    "is the overall sign .",
    "for @xmath205 the dirac operator   automatically reduces to the staggered dirac operator  @xcite . in the case",
    "that @xmath234 is in the considered representation of the gauge group when @xmath235 is , the signs can be absorbed .",
    "for example this is the case for the fundamental representation of @xmath236 .    for the formulas  , and we assumed that the temporal direction has an odd partition of lattice sites . in the case that the temporal direction has an even number of lattice sites we switch in the formulas the directions @xmath237 and @xmath76 .    in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we compare monte carlo simulations of quenched qcd lattice dirac operators in the naive discretization and in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath238 ,",
    "group elements are drawn from the haar measure ) with random matrix theory results .",
    "we have chosen several lattices , dimensions and representations of the gauge groups @xmath236 and @xmath239 .",
    "the agreement with the analytical random matrix results recalled in appendix  [ sec : rmt ] is quite good according to the very small sizes of the lattices .",
    "one well - known consequence of the naive discretization of the dirac operator is the change of its spectral properties , see @xcite .",
    "we analyzed this change for an arbitrary qcd - like gauge theory and at arbitrary space - time dimension @xmath240 .",
    "when one or more directions have an even number of lattice sites the degeneracy increases exponentially .",
    "this also results into an increase of the number of flavors ( neglecting the doublers still comprised in the continuum limit ) by @xmath241 with @xmath242_2)/2\\rfloor}$ ] and @xmath219 the number of directions with even parity .",
    "for @xmath243 the dirac operator has no zero modes such that the topological charge @xmath244 will be zero .",
    "hence all zero modes can only appear when taking the continuum limit .",
    "for example follana et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed how these zero modes show up for staggered lattice configurations which converge to configurations with non - trivial topological charge . to decide whether a mode is a  would - be \" zero mode or not was decided by them via measuring the chirality of the individual modes .",
    "we have not considered this particular issue here .",
    "moreover the anti - unitary symmetries and chiral symmetries experience a shift along the symmetry classification of the continuum symmetries , see table  [ tab : cont - class ] as well as @xcite .",
    "this shift is explicitly given by @xmath245 .",
    "thus the symmetries of the staggered dirac operator  @xcite are always the one of the corresponding continuum theories at dimension @xmath246 regardless what original dimension was chosen as long as the dimension is @xmath240 . in particular the symmetry breaking patterns will be those at @xmath246 .",
    "additionally we derived an explicit form of the non - degenerate part of the dirac operator .",
    "it reduces to the staggered dirac operator  @xcite when all directions have an even partition .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations with this reduced dirac operator in the strong coupling limit and in the three- , four- and five - dimensional quenched theory .",
    "the spectral statistics of the lowest eigenvalues were compared with random matrix theory results .",
    "the good agreement of the numerics with the analytical results confirm our predictions .",
    "this agreement is at least as good as it was found in four dimensions for the staggered fermions  @xcite despite the fact that the lattices we simulated are very small .",
    "our results may yield a basis to understand the continuum limit of staggered and naive fermions .",
    "in particular it is still an unsolved problem whether the global symmetries change to those of the correct continuum theory .",
    "here we have to say that the weak coupling limit studied in  @xcite nurtures some doubt because on the smallest scales the global symmetries of the lattice dirac operator always shows up .",
    "when assuming , nonetheless , that the continuum limit exists , one can study the infra - red spectrum of the dirac operator and , hence , the lightest pseudo scalar mesons with random matrix theory .",
