    "stochastic markov dynamics is a crucial modeling device for ( non - equilibrium ) statistical mechanics , as well as a technical tool for simulation purposes , i.e.  monte carlo algorithms . in the past years",
    ", markov evolutions have been also considered for many - body quantum systems , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a lot remains to be clarified about their physical origin and justification , but in the present paper we take a top - down approach and we assume that a markovian dynamics is given .",
    "its generator ( lindblad operator ) is a sum of quasi - local terms .",
    "we allow this dynamics to be non - equilibrium in that it does not need to satisfy a detailed balance condition , i.e.  we do not ask that it is self - adjoint w.r.t .  to a kms state ( gibbs state ) .",
    "we are motivated by the following question : when does the markov dynamics allow for phase coexistence , i.e.  multiple stationary states in the thermodynamic limit ?",
    "a property that appears often together with uniqueness , i.e.  no phase coexistence , is ( uniform ) exponential relaxation to the stationary state , meaning that expected values of local observables approach their stationary values exponentially fast independent of the volume and boundary conditions .",
    "this notion and the related property of ` rapid mixing ' , which was important in recent work @xcite on similar questions as ours , is made more precise in the main part of the text .",
    "as such , the question of phase uniqueness is also interesting for classical systems .",
    "one could conjecture that for any detailed balance dynamics in the uniqueness regime ( e.g.  at high enough temperature for glauber type dynamics , etc . )",
    "the uniqueness is stable against small non - detailed balance perturbation . to our knowledge , this has yet been proven in any generality .",
    "nevertheless , there are numerous results on uniqueness and uniform exponential relaxation ( and log - sobolev inequalities ) , in particular in the regime of ` complete analyticity ' .",
    "we refer to works like @xcite and references therein .    on the quantum side , uniqueness and exponential approach",
    "have been established in @xcite for small perturbations of product dynamics with specific generators of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 maps arbitrary operators into operators that act as ( multiple of ) the identity within the spatial set @xmath4 . in @xcite , exponential relaxation",
    "is proven starting from a log - sobolev inequality , and in @xcite , exponential relaxation was obtained for a class of cellular automata .",
    "our work is concerned with general perturbations of product dynamics ( a classical analogue was treated in @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the perturbed dynamics remains exponentially ergodic with a unique ( infinite - volume ) stationary state , see theorem [ thm ] .",
    "additionally , if the dynamics depends analytically on some parameter , then so does the stationary state .",
    "boundary conditions do not affect the thermodynamic limit of the dynamics and stationary state , which is the content of corollary [ cor ] .",

    "note however that it is unclear and an interesting question whether perturbations of product dynamics as studied here satisfy rapid mixing .",
    "it does not follow from our result as we only obtain estimates with prefactors that grow exponentially in the support of local observables .",
    "this question is interesting also because it has been established that rapid mixing furthermore implies exponential decay of correlations and an area law ( for the ` mutual information ' ) for the stationary state , see @xcite",
    ". +      the result on the existence of the infinite volume dynamics @xmath92 is already contained in the work of nachtergaele et al .",
    "@xcite applying lieb ",
    "robinson propagation bounds @xcite for qms ; see also @xcite for similar results in the context of ( classical ) markov processes .",
    "in fact , we use their result to prove , as a corollary of the theorem , independence from boundary conditions for the thermodynamic limit of stationary states . for that purpose",
    "we define the following qms generator in volume @xmath127 with boundary conditions outside a bulk volume @xmath128 , @xmath129    [ cor ] under the conditions of the theorem , there are constants @xmath130 , such that the following holds for all @xmath131 : let @xmath48 be a stationary state for @xmath132 , then @xmath133 for all local observables @xmath94 with support in @xmath95 , where the state @xmath96 is defined as in the theorem .",
    "this result may be viewed as a dissipative version of yarotsky s result on ground states for weak perturbations of gapped non - interacting systems @xcite . here",
    "the qms was defined by sums of local generators , and by definition each of them has a non - empty kernel containing the identity .",
    "this fact simplifies the problem considerably and is somewhat comparable with frustration - freeness when studying ground states of local hamiltonians .",
    "note however we are here , in case of non - equilibrium , dealing with generators that may not be self - adjoint .",
    "+        for this example we consider a chain of qubits , i.e.  each @xmath134 , @xmath135 , is a copy of @xmath136 .",
    "we denote with @xmath137 , @xmath138 , the usual pauli matrices , and with @xmath139 and @xmath140 the spin up and spin down eigenstate of @xmath141 in dirac s notation .",

    "the unperturbed product dynamics is generated by copies of a single - site generator @xmath144 + \\sigma^+ a \\sigma^- - { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{2 } } \\bigl\\ { a , \\sigma^+\\sigma^-\\bigr\\ } , \\quad a\\in{{\\mathcal b}}({{\\mathcal h}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is a parameter indicating the strength of a ( transverse ) field , and where the expression in square brackets is the commutator and in curly brackets the anti - commutator .",
    "the coherent and dissipative part of the generator commute with each other .",
    "it gives rise to a unique stationary state @xmath146 at each site and holds @xmath147-uniformly for the projection @xmath148 , for example , with constants @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we take a translation invariant perturbation acting only on pairs of nearest neighbour sites defined through @xmath151 , \\quad a\\in{{\\mathcal a}}_{\\{x , x+1\\}}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 is the local operator acting on site @xmath71 as @xmath153 and where the coupling strength @xmath154 is another parameter .",
    "the coherent part of the dynamics is that of the transverse field ising model with hamiltonian @xmath155 by our theorem , if the coupling @xmath156 is small enough ( e.g.  @xmath157 , see also remark [ rem : finrange ] on finite range interactions ) and for all values of @xmath147 , the stationary state for the full dynamics generated by @xmath158 as in is unique even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we chose the particular form of perturbation above to relate to the well - known ( hamiltonian ) transverse ising model , which is exactly solvable .",
    "see also @xcite , where similar dissipative models are solved exactly .",
    "this property is however not relevant here : uniqueness holds for any perturbation that is small enough according to the theorem .",
    "we may , for example , add a small longitudinal field @xmath159 at each site , then the model is not longer mapped to free fermions by a jordan  wigner transformation .",
    "an immediate interesting question would be whether uniqueness persists as @xmath156 is increased or if there is a transition to a phase with multiple stationary states .",
    "it seems tempting ( though a - priori not justified ) to make a comparison with ground state properties of the ising model in transverse field , for which indeed a quantum phase transition ( in the ground state ) occurs at a certain critical value of @xmath160 and there is phase coexistence above the critical value .",
    "this is also very much connected to a question that is not even fully resolved in the classical domain : is it possible to devise a one - dimensional cellular automaton with ` non - degenerate ' noise that can have phase coexistence , see @xcite .",
    "in our second example we start out with a product dynamics describing a quantum spin chain where each site @xmath161 is in contact with a separate heat bath at temperature @xmath162 .",
    "given a local hamiltonian @xmath163 , this contact is modelled by a qms with unique stationary state @xmath164 , the gibbs state .",

    "using that the interaction conserves energy locally , i.e.  , we can write the continuity equation @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the current from site @xmath176 to @xmath71 and @xmath177 the current originating from the heat bath at site @xmath71 .",
    "the game here is the following : how should one choose the temperatures @xmath178 such that the currents @xmath179 from the heat baths in the bulk all vanish ( but not necessarily @xmath180 and @xmath181 ) . of course , choosing all @xmath178 equal is a solution ( corresponding to global equilibrium ) .",
    "but there are other solutions , e.g. corresponding to a uniform heat current @xmath182 through the chain , @xmath183 the idea motivating such a procedure is that the coupled heat baths model chaotic degrees of freedom along the chain , so that indeed the steady currents from these reservoirs should vanish .",
    "the non - trivial question is now : how does the profile of @xmath178 look like for a nonzero @xmath182 .",
    "the problem can be solved for sufficiently small @xmath184 , and the result is that the current @xmath182 and local temperature differences @xmath185 both scale as @xmath186 obeying fourier s law @xmath187 for some heat conductivity @xmath188 , see @xcite .",
    "we do not prove this theorem here as it strays too far from the main message of this paper .",
    "however , some thought shows that the result of the present paper allows to establish this , as it shows that the local currents depend analytically and exponentially weak on distant temperature parameters . for related results on such chains of ` self - consistent heat baths ' in classical mechanics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
