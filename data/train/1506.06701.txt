    "@xcite proposed a protocol to disassemble a quantum state at one location ( alice ) and to reconstruct it in a spatially separated location ( bob ) .",
    "they proved that , if alice and bob share quantum correlations of epr type  @xcite , then bob can reconstruct the state of alice by using classical channels and local operations .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` quantum teleportation '' , and it has important applications in quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "the result inspired discussions among physicists , in particular , on the experimental feasibility of the protocol . despite some controversies in technical issues ,",
    "the first experimental realisation of quantum teleportation was simultaneously performed in 1997 in two groups , one led by a. zeilinger in innsbruck  @xcite , and the other by f. de martini in rome  @xcite . in both experiments",
    ", the polarisation degrees of freedoms of the photons were teleported .",
    "it was shown that , even within the unavoidable experimental errors , the overlap between the input state and the teleported one exceeded the classical threshold achievable when quantum correlations are not present .",
    "after the success of the first experiments , alternatives for a variety of systems and degrees of freedom emerged",
    ". of particular interest is the continuous - variable scheme studied by l. vaidman  @xcite and s. l. braunstein et al .",
    "@xcite , whose experimental implementation was realised by a. furusawa et al .",
    "@xcite in the optical regime .",
    "this experiment consisted in teleporting the information embedded in the continuous values of the conjugated variables of a propagating electromagnetic signal in the optical regime .",
    "optical frequencies were preferred because of their higher detection efficiency , essential to achieve a high fidelity performance  @xcite , and because propagation losses are almost negligible . during the last years , an impressive progress in teleporting quantum optical states to larger distances , first in fibers  @xcite , and afterwards in free - space  @xcite , was made .",
    "this rapid progress may even allow us to realise quantum communication via satellites in near future with corresponding distances of about @xmath0 km .",
    "in optical systems , the long - distance teleportation is , to some extent , straightforward , because of the high transmissivity of optical photons in the atmosphere .",
    "nevertheless , unavoidable losses are setting an upper limit for the teleportation distance .",
    "however , there were fundamental theoretical studies on how to allow for a long - distance entanglement distribution .",
    "the underlying concepts are based on quantum repeaters  @xcite , whose implementation on specific platforms needs an individual study .",
    "so far , the entanglement sharing and quantum teleportation was reported for cold atoms  @xcite , and even for macroscopic systems  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we discuss the possibility of implementing the quantum teleportation protocol of propagating electromagnetic quantum signals in the microwave regime .",
    "this line of research is justified by the recent achievements of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite . in cqed , a quantum bit ( qubit )",
    "is implemented using the quantum degrees of freedom of a macroscopic superconducting circuit operated at low temperatures , i.e. @xmath1 @xmath2-@xmath3 mk , in order to suppress thermal fluctuations .",
    "superconducting josephson junctions are used to introduce non - linearities in these circuits , which are essential in both quantum computation and the engineering of qubits .",
    "typical qubits are built to have a transition frequency in the range @xmath4-@xmath5 ghz ( microwave regime ) , and they are coupled to an electromagnetic field with the same frequency .",
    "this choice is determined by readily available microwave devices and techniques for this frequency band , such as low noise cryogenic amplifiers , down converters , network analysers , among others .",
    "we note that apart from its relevance in quantum communication , quantum teleportation is also crucial to perform quantum computation , e.g. it can be used to build a deterministic cnot gate  @xcite .",
    "recently , path - entanglement between propagating quantum microwaves has been investigated in refs .",
    "following what was previously done in the optical regime  @xcite , a two - mode squeezed state , in which the modes were spatially separated from each other , was generated .",
    "the two entangled beams could be used to perform with microwaves a protocol equivalent to the one used in optical quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "these articles represent the most recent of a large amount of results presented during the last years  @xcite , which are the building blocks of a quantum microwave communication theory .",
    "inspired by the last theoretical and experimental results , we want to discuss the feasibility of a quantum teleportation realisation for propagating quantum microwaves .",
    "the article is organised in the following way : in section  ii , we introduce the continuous - variable quantum teleportation protocol and its figures of merit . in section  iii , we describe the preparation of a propagating quantum microwave epr state . in section",
    "iv , we show how to implement a microwave equivalent of an optical homodyne detection , by using only linear devices .",
    "the section  v is focused on the analysis of losses . in particular , we consider an asymmetric case in which the losses in alice s and bob s paths are different . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the feedforward part of the protocol in both a digital and an analog fashion . finally , as the entanglement distribution step is affected by losses , we present in section  vii how to implement a quantum repeater based on weak measurements in a cqed setup , in order to allow the entanglement sharing at larger distances .",
    "in this section , we briefly explain the quantum teleportation protocol introduced in  @xcite , and we introduce some useful figures of merit to quantify the quality of the scheme in a realistic setup .",
    "the protocol consists in teleporting a continuous variable state , and it has already been applied in the optical regime to both a gaussian state  @xcite and a schrdinger cat state  @xcite .",
    "an equivalent scheme for microwaves is still missing , therefore a specific treatment , in which the restriction imposed by the technology is taken into account , is mandatory to analyse its feasibility .",
    "let us consider a situation in which two parties , alice and bob , want to share a quantum state . more specifically ,",
    "alice , labelled with @xmath6 , wants to send a quantum state @xmath7 , whose corresponding system is labeled by @xmath8 , to bob , denoted by @xmath9 . additionally , let them share an ancillary entangled state @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are quantum conjugate observables obeying the standard commutation rule @xmath14=i$ ] .",
    "after alice performs a bell - type measurement on the system @xmath8-@xmath6 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the outcomes of the measurement .",
    "the resulting values of bob s quadrature would be @xmath18 by displacing adaptively bob s state by @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 is shifted by @xmath16 and @xmath21 by @xmath17 , we finally have @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the final state of bob .",
    "therefore , the final state of bob is the state of the system @xmath8 .",
    "note that bob needs to perform local operations conditioned to alice s measurement outcomes .",
    "as the outcomes are two numbers , we may allow alice and bob to communicate throughout a classical channel , see fig .  1 .",

    "if we perform the teleportation protocol with this state , the final wigner function for bob s state is the weighted integral @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the probability distributions of the outcomes of @xmath33 . after introducing the variables @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and defining @xmath36 , @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the complex gaussian distribution with mean value zero and variance @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 . in the limit of infinite @xmath26 , @xmath39 approaches to the delta function , and then @xmath42 . in the following",
    ", we will refer only to the variance of the quadratures , regardless of whether they are noisy or not .",
    "therefore , our treatment is general , and it includes also the lossy case , in which we do not have a perfect two - mode squeezed state as a resource . in order to evaluate the performance of the protocol , entanglement fidelity  @xcite can be used .",
    "if @xmath8 is in a pure state , the entanglement fidelity is given by @xmath43 if alice is restricted to teleport coherent states , the protocol works better than in the classical case corresponding to @xmath44 if @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "let us remark that the performance of the protocol for coherent states , and in general for gaussian states , depends only on the variances @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , one can verify that @xcite @xmath47 and @xmath48 is valid if and only if @xmath49 more general cases could also be discussed , but this does not provide any additionally insight into the question under which conditions the protocol is feasible .",

    "measuring a quadrature of a weak microwave signal is considered a particularly difficult task , since the low energy of microwave photons makes it difficult to realise a single - photon detector .",

    "cryogenic high electronic mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifiers are routinely used in quantum microwave experiments  @xcite , because of their large gains in a relatively broad frequency band . however , hemt amplifiers are phase insensitive and add a significant amount of noise photons , sufficient to make the quantum teleportation protocol fail .",

    "for instance , for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we find that @xmath127 increases with increasing @xmath131 .    to characterise the losses , we use a beam splitter model .",
    "following fig .  1 , the fields after collecting the losses in the entanglement sharing step are @xmath135 where @xmath125 are the transmission coefficients modelling the losses in alice s and bob s channel respectively , and @xmath136 are modes in a thermal state ( similar formulas hold for @xmath137 ) .",
    "then , @xmath138 and @xmath139 we note that the second term in eq .",
    "results from an asymmetry of the losses in alice s and bob s channel and it increases with squeezing level in the epr jpas . in the optical domain , @xmath140 , allowing to neglect this term even for asymmetric channels .",

    "3a , we see that the allowed difference between @xmath131 and @xmath128 decreases with decreasing @xmath148 . in fig .",
    "3b , instead , we see that for large differences between @xmath131 and @xmath128 , it is convenient to attenuate the signal of alice .",

    "these numbers imply that the device experimentally investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , two of the few available studies of jpa noise in the degenerate mode , are already close to the threshold where a benefit over classical approaches can be achieved .",
    "we immediately see that the largest contributions to @xmath155 come from @xmath153 and @xmath124 .",
    "for example , a version of the protocol would work if the noise added by the detection amplifiers is reduced by a good factor of three to @xmath156 , corresponding to @xmath100  m distance from the epr source .",
    "similarly , improvements in the epr state generation would help via a reduced @xmath124 .",
    "regarding the latter , particular attention should be given to the distance over which an epr pair can be distributed .",
    "for our numbers , assuming a superconducting coaxial cable of @xmath100  m length , the dominating contributions to the losses still come from the beam splitter and connectors .",
    "therefore , an implementation of our protocol for the quantum microwave communication between two adjacent chips of a superconducting quantum processor or two superconducting quantum information units in nearby buildings seems feasible with some reasonable technological improvements . in this context , we want to reiterate that the big advantage of the quantum microwave teleportation lies in the fact that microwaves are the natural operating frequencies of superconducting quantum circuits .",

    "holds , we have applied a proper attenuator in alice in order to optimise @xmath124 .",
    "in the quantum teleportation protocol , alice needs to measure and send the result of the measurement to bob via a _ classical _ channel . then , bob uses this information to apply a displacement in his system .",
    "this process is called a feedforward , and is considered tough to implement , independently of the considered system . in particular , in the microwave case , the measurement process may be slow , resulting in an ultimate loss of fidelity .",
    "in realistic experiments , a quantum microwave signal has to be amplified before detection .",
    "if the amplification is large , the signal becomes insensitive to losses at room temperature .",

    "this analog feedforward is depicted in fig .  4 , and it works in the following way .",
    "let us assume the lossless case , and send the two amplified signals of alice to a hybrid ring .",

    "this displacement is then implemented with a high transmissivity directional coupler , whose inputs are the signal of bob , and the output signal of alice . in the figure , @xmath171 is the output signal of alice , @xmath172 is the signal of bob , @xmath173 is the output of the teleportation scheme , while @xmath174 is the transmissivity and @xmath175 the scattering matrix of the directional coupler .",
    "a displacement operator can be implemented by sending a strong coherent state and the field which we want to displace to a high - transmissivity mirror @xcite .",
    "hence , the transmitted signal is @xmath176[displacement1 ] where @xmath53 is without a hat because it represents a coherent state .",
    "if we choose @xmath177 and @xmath178 such that @xmath179 , we obtain @xmath180 which approximates a displacement operator . in a microwave experiment ,",
    "the operation can be implemented with a microwave directional coupler . if we send signals b and f as inputs to a directional coupler with transmissivity @xmath181 ,",
    "the corresponding output is @xmath182 where the last approximation holds for @xmath183 , and , for the sake of simplicity , we have considered the lossless case . considering the typical values @xmath92 and @xmath184 , we would need a reflectivity factor @xmath185 .",
    "for this value , small errors in @xmath186 would result in a large error in the displacement operator .",
    "this problem can be overcome by attenuating at low temperatures the signal f before the directional coupler , in order to neglect the attenuator noise . in this case , setting @xmath187 , the transmitted signal is the same as in - .",
    "for instance , if we choose @xmath188 , we derive a reasonable value for the reflectivity : @xmath189 .",
    "the described analog method allows us to perform the feedforward without an actual knowledge of the result of alice s measurement .",
    "indeed , the jpa and hemt amplifiers work as measurement devices . on the one hand ,",
    "the advantage is that we save the time required to digitalised the signal . on the other hand ,",

    "this can be done by estimating the digitisation time and the corresponding losses in the bob delay line , which strongly depends on the available technology .",
    "indeed , currently available iq mixers and fpga technology requires @xmath190  ns for measuring and processing the information . during this time",
    ", the signal needs to be delayed in bob s channel .",
    "if we consider a delay line where the group velocity of the electromagnetic field is @xmath191  m / s , @xmath192 corresponds to a delay line in bob of @xmath193  m. comparing the values of @xmath124 for the zero measurement time and the realistic @xmath168  ns measurement time , we see a change in @xmath124 of @xmath194 in the case of @xmath100  m distance ( assuming @xmath167  db per meter of power cable losses ) , which is considerably lower than the current values achievable for @xmath6 . notice that this discrepancy decreases with the distance between alice and bob .",
    "this means that the digital feedforward is currently preferable to the analog one , but the analog feedforward can become a useful technological tool when the jpa technology will reach a reasonable noise level .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous sections , the entanglement distribution between the two parties , alice and bob , is particularly challenging due to the large losses involved .",
    "moreover , while in the optical case the noise added by a room temperature environment corresponds to the vacuum , in the microwave regime , this noise would correspond to a thermal state containing @xmath195 photons . even in the most favourable situation in which we build a cryogenic setup to share the entanglement",
    ", we would have a collapse of the correlations after @xmath196 m due to the detection inefficiency and losses .",
    "the implementation of quantum repeaters in the microwave regime could potentially solve this issue .",
    "a quantum repeater is able to distillate entanglement and to share it at larger distance , at the expense of efficiency .",
    "a protocol for distributing entanglement at large distance in the microwave regime has been recently proposed in  @xcite , but it relies on the implementation of an optical - to - microwave quantum interface  @xcite , which has not yet been realised experimentally .    here , we discuss the microwave implementation of quantum repeater based on a non - deterministic noiseless linear amplification via weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "a noiseless linear amplifier  @xcite can be modeled as an operator @xmath197 applied to its input state .",
    "for example , for a input coherent state @xmath198 , we would have @xmath199 as output , resulting in a amplification of all quadratures without adding noise .",
    "let us consider a two - mode squeezed state @xmath200 .",
    "notice that the amount of entanglement increases on increasing @xmath26 .",
    "if we are able to implement the operator @xmath197 , with @xmath201 on one mode , say bob , we have @xmath202 with @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "a similar argument holds , if we have losses in each of the two modes .",
    "in fact , the state after the loss mechanism is @xmath205 where @xmath206 correspond to the loss modes .",
    "if we apply the operator @xmath207 , the output state has the same form but with the new effective parameters  @xcite @xmath208 and @xmath209 , which is accompanied by an increase of the entanglement .",
    "accordingly , the final @xmath124 would be lower , which corresponds to higher values of @xmath157 in table  1 .",
    "note that if @xmath210 , i.e. no entanglement at the input , then the output state is not entangled either .",
    "therefore , in order to increase the amount of entanglement , we need a minimum of entanglement at the input .",
    "the operator @xmath197 corresponds to a noiseless phase - insensitive linear amplifier , and it can not be implemented deterministically",
    ". however , there exist probabilistic methods to realise it approximately .",
    "a probabilistic noiseless linear amplification scheme has already been demonstrated in the optical regime  @xcite , but it relies on the possibility of counting photons .",
    "in contrast , the weak measurement scheme  @xcite requires quadrature measurements that can be applied in the microwave regime .    let bob s mode interact with an ancillary system in a coherent state @xmath198 accordingly to the cross - kerr hamiltonian @xmath211 , where @xmath64 is a coupling constant .",
    "let us further consider low - time interaction , i.e. @xmath212 .",
    "if we postselect the ancilla in the state @xmath213 , i.e. the eigenstate of the @xmath13 quadrature corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath101 , the whole final state is @xmath214 where @xmath215 is called `` weak value '' , and , in the second approximation , we have assumed @xmath216 . by choosing appropriately the values of @xmath53 and @xmath101 ,",
    "we can induce a value of @xmath217 , whose imaginary part is positive .",
    "if we set @xmath218 , we have a scheme to implement @xmath207 up to a known phase - shift @xmath219 , with success probability density @xmath220 .",
    "for instance , by choosing @xmath221 and @xmath222 , we have a gain for any @xmath223 , which happens with a @xmath224 probability . in this case",
    ", an imperfect quadrature measurement can be corrected by just shifting the allowed results of the ancilla measurement , with a consequent lost of efficiency .",
    "note that , due to the probabilistic nature of the scheme , alice and bob need to communicate classically in order to distillate the entanglement , see fig .",
    "5 . however",
    ", this classical communication can be performed at the end , in a post - selection fashion , as alice does not need to perform any operation on her system .",
    "[ qrepeater ]    * fig .",
    "5*. quantum repeater scheme with weak measurement and postselection .",
    "a probabilistic noiseless linear amplifier is applied to one of the two parties , via the implementation of a weak cross - kerr interaction with an ancillary signal .",
    "this interaction emerges as a fourth order expansion of the dynamics of the signal and the ancilla coupled with a transmon quantum bit , modeled as a three level system , in a non - resonant regime .",
    "the ancilla is then measured , and the result is sent classically to alice for post - selection .    the cross - kerr effect , characterised by a hamiltonian of the kind @xmath225 , has already been proposed in cqed in the context of single - photon resolved photodetectors , see  @xcite . basically , this interaction emerges in the fourth order expansion of the dynamics of two microwave modes coupled with a transmon in a non - resonant regime . by modelling the transmon as a three - level system ,",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath226+\\hbar g_b\\left[b|1\\rangle\\langle0| + b^\\dag |0\\rangle\\langle1|\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 represents the ancillary mode and @xmath17 bob s mode . in the interaction picture with respect @xmath227 ,",
    "the new hamiltonian is @xmath228+\\hbar g_b\\left[b|1\\rangle\\langle0| + b^\\dag |0\\rangle\\langle1|\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and we have set @xmath231 . if we set the parameters in order to have @xmath232 , and we inizialize the transmon in @xmath233 , the effective hamiltonian is @xmath234 where we have implemented a fourth order expansion of the magnus series , and we have used the rotating wave approximation .",
    "typical parameters allowing this are @xmath235  ghz , @xmath236 , with @xmath237  mhz and @xmath238  ghz , and @xmath239  khz .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq",
    ".   represents the cross - kerr effect up to a known phase , that can be corrected at the end . in this scheme , dissipations are negligible , as we are interested in very low interaction times .",
    "we have considered a quantum teleportation protocol of propagating quantum microwaves .",
    "we have analysed its realisation by introducing figures of merit ( i.e. @xmath155 and @xmath6 ) that takes into account losses and detector efficiency . in particular , we have underlined the difference between the optical case ( where photodetectors are available , and losses are negligible ) and the microwave regime .",
    "indeed , we have considered jpas in order to perform single - shot quadrature measurements , and we have proposed an analog feedforward scheme , which does not rely on digitisation of signals . moreover , we have discussed the losses mechanisms , highlighting in which measure they limit the realisation of the protocol .",
    "we have used typical parameters of present state - of - art experimental setups in order to identify the required improvements of these setups to allow for a first proof - of - principle experiment .",
    "finally , we have introduced a quantum repeater scheme based on weak measurements and postselection .",

    "<S> propagating quantum microwaves have been proposed and successfully implemented to generate entanglement , thereby establishing a promising platform for the realisation of a quantum communication channel . however , the implementation of quantum teleportation with photons in the microwave regime is still absent . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , recent developments in the field show that this key protocol could be feasible with current technology , which would pave the way to boost the field of microwave quantum communication . here </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the feasibility of a possible implementation of microwave quantum teleportation in a realistic scenario with losses . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we propose how to implement quantum repeaters in the microwave regime without using photodetection , a key prerequisite to achieve long distance entanglement distribution . </S>"
