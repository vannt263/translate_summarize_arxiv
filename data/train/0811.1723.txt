    "graphene is a newly realized two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system that has attracted a great deal of interest in the scientific community because of the new physics which it exhibits and because of its potential as a new material for electronic technology  @xcite .",
    "the agent responsible for many of the interesting electronic properties of graphene sheets is the non - bravais honeycomb - lattice arrangement of carbon atoms , which leads to a gapless semiconductor with valence and conduction @xmath0-bands .",
    "states near the fermi energy of a graphene sheet are described by a spin - independent massless dirac hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi velocity , which is density - independent and roughly three - hundred times smaller that the velocity of light in vacuum , and @xmath3 is a vector constructed with two pauli matrices @xmath4 , which operate on pseudospin ( sublattice ) degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the eigenstates of @xmath5 have a definite _ chirality _ rather than a definite pseudospin , _",
    "i.e. _ they have a definite projection of the honeycomb - sublattice pseudospin onto the momentum @xmath6 .",
    "when non - relativistic coulombic electron - electron interactions are added to the kinetic hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_kin ] ) , graphene represents a new type of many - electron problem , distinct from both an ordinary 2d electron gas ( eg ) and from quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the dirac - like wave equation and the chirality of its eigenstates lead indeed to both unusual electron - electron interaction effects  @xcite and to unusual response to external potentials  @xcite .    within this low energy description ,",
    "the properties of doped graphene sheets depend on the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath7 and on an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 accounts for spin and valley degeneracy , @xmath10 is the fermi wave number with @xmath11 the electron density , and @xmath12 should be assigned a value corresponding to the wavevector range over which the continuum model ( [ eq : h_kin ] ) describes graphene . for definiteness",

    "in this work we calculate the helmholtz free energy @xmath20 of doped graphene sheets within the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to access important thermodynamic quantities , such as the compressibility and the specific heat , which can be calculated by taking appropriate derivatives of the free energy .",
    "we show that , at low temperatures , the specific heat of doped graphene , contrary to the one of the undoped system  @xcite , has the usual linear - in - temperature behavior , which is solely controlled by the renormalized velocity of quasiparticles as in a normal fermi liquid .",
    "the free energy @xmath21 is usually decomposed into the sum of a noninteracting term @xmath22 and an interaction contribution @xmath23 . to evaluate the interaction contribution to the helmholtz free energy",
