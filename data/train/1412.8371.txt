    "a very important assumption of the standard model of cosmology ( @xmath0 ) is based on the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker solutions of einstein s equations . the homogeneity and the isotropy",
    "are considered on large scale in the universe .",
    "the universe is not isotropic or spatially homogeneus on local scales .    the question of whether the universe is homogeneous and isotropic is of fundamental importance to cosmology , but we have not decisive answers . on the other hand",
    "neither observations of luminosity distance combinated with galaxy number counts nor isotropic cosmic microwave background radiation are able to say if the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the fundamental question consists in a simple observation : this geometry is the only that is able to explain and to be compatible with experimental data ?",
    "are we sure that the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is a logical and comforting way of thinking , or better is it an _ a - priori _ assumption ? + this is a pertinent question because we need that more @xmath1 of the content of our universe must be dark ( energy and matter ) in order to have a compatible model with observations .",
    "the solution of the dark energy puzzle is the keystone of the modern cosmology .    are there observables that can prove the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales ?",
    "very interesting studies has been done in this direction .",
    "the @xmath2cdm model of the universe is remarkably successfull , but we have important tensions between the model and the experimental data . on the other hand dark energy is the biggest puzzle in cosmology .",
    "there are many papers with more detailed discussions about dark energy , that are outside the scope of this paper , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are many reasons that consider the @xmath2cdm model full of theoretical problems @xcite ,",
    "one is that @xmath2 has a value absurdly small in quantum physics .",
    "moreover we can not expect that dark energy will have in future locally observable effects .",
    "+   + the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has high isotropy and this is considered as a strong evidence of the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , that is to say the universe is well described by means of a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model .",
    "the main indication for this model is due to the ehlers , geren and sachs theorem ( egs ) @xcite in 1968 .",
    "this theorem is due to an earlier paper of tauber and weinberg @xcite in 1961 . in egs theorem",
    "we consider the observers in an expanding universe , dust universe measures isotropic cmb and this implies that flrw metric is valid and the cosmological principle is also valid .",
    "this theorem is important because it permits to have the homogeneity and isotropy not from experimental measurements of the isotropy of the universe but from the cmb .",
    "but as we will discuss later , cmb radiation have small anisotropies with @xmath3 of amplitude !",
    "+   + as regards the homogeneity of the universe it is important to note that the mass density of the universe is not inhomogeneous on scales much smaller than the hubble radius , in other terms the homogeneity is not true at all orders but we can assume to be valid on distance greater that 100 mpc .",
    "many papers indicate this feature , see for example @xcite ( and references therein ) , where the author indicates evidences that galaxy distribution is spatially inhomogenous for @xmath4 .",
    "+ the strong interest in inhomogenous cosmological models , in particular the so called lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) model @xcite ( for more details see @xcite and references therein ) , that represents a spherically symmetric exact solution to the einstein s equations with pressureless ideal fluid , is due to the its simplicity and it is very useful .",
    "in fact it allows for studies of inhomogeneities that can not be analyzed as perturbative deviations from flrw and it permits to evaluate the effect of inhomogeneities in particular it has been studied that ltb models without dark energy can fit observed data .",
    "+ the high precision cosmology is able to understand by more details our study about universe .",
    "when we consider the isotropy of cmb we must not forget that this is not sufficient to say that our region of space is isotropic @xcite .",
    "we have two very important observational evidences showing that we do nt have exact isotropy @xcite .",
    "both evidences may be caused by an anisotropic phase during the evolution of our universe in other terms the existence of anomalies in cmb suggests the presence of an anomalous plane - mirroring symmetry on large scales .",
    "the same anomalous features in seven - years wmap data and planck data seems to suggest that our universe could be non - isotropic .",
    "the first is the presence of small anisotropy deviations as regards the isotropy of the cmb .",
    "in fact we have small anisotropies with @xmath3 amplitude .",
    "the second is connected with the presence of large angle anomalies @xcite .",
    "these anomalies can be considered in 4 families :    \\1 ) the alignment of quadrupole and octupole moments ;    \\2 ) the large scale asymmetry ;    \\3 ) the very strange cold spot @xcite ;    \\4 ) the low quadrupole moment of the cmb , that is very important because it may indicate an ellipsoidal - bianchi type i anisotropic evolution of the universe .",
    "this is due to the fact that the low quadrupole moment is suppressed at large scale and this suppression can not be explained by the common cosmological model . + some years ago it has been shown @xcite that if we start with a flrw universe , it is possible to have small deviations from homogeneity and isotropy taking into account small deviations in the cmb . in particular",
    "if we consider an homogeneous and anisotropic universe , the small quadrupole anisotropy in cmb implies a very small anisotropy in the universe .",
    "next , general results have been established @xcite , in which the authors does not assume a priori homogeneity and they found that small anisotropies in cmb imply that the cosmo is not exactly flrw but it is almost flrw .",
    "limits on anisotropy and inhomogeneity can be found starting from cmb .",
    "+ the cosmological model that takes into account all these and stimulates many interest is the `` anisotropic bianchi type i model '' that can be an intriguing alternative to the standard model flrw , in which small deviations from the isotropy is able to explain the anisotropies and the anomalies in the cmb .",
    "+ the anisotropy considered in this work might be interpreted as an imprinting , a primordial relic of an early anisotropy that appears in the context of a multi- dimensional cosmological model of unified string theories .    in this paper",
    "our goals are to study an anisotropic and inhomogeneous model of the universe .",
    "in particular we introduce a new approach to a universe in which inhomogeneities and anisotropies coexist , therefore we study in order to obtain the relative einstein s equations . these models of universe inhomogeneous and anisotropic has been studied in different physical situations , as the role of the diffusion forces in governing the large - scale dynamics of inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe @xcite .",
    "the supernovae observations are good tests about the structure of the space - time on different scales .",
    "this is a very important point , in fact some years ago zeldovich @xcite studied the importance of the effects of the inhomogeneities on light propagation and also in the next years @xcite . to check this model",
    "we calculate the luminosity distance in order to compare theoretical approach with experimental data .",
    "we explain the acceleration of the universe without invoking the presence of a cosmological constant or dark energy .",

    "we calculate the metric for this ltb - bianchi i model of the universe . in section iii after providing the calculation of various symbols we write the einstein s equations taking into account this geometry .",
