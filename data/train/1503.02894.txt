    "in his classes , robins was struck by the gap present between the informal , yet insightful , language of epidemiologists such as @xcite ( @xcite ) expressed in terms of `` confounding , comparability , and bias , '' and the technical language of mathematical statistics in which these terms either did not have analogs or had other meanings . robins first major paper `` the foundations of confounding in epidemiology '' written in 1982 ,",
    "though only published in @xcite , was an attempt to bridge this gap .",
    "as one example , he offered a precise mathematical definition for the informal epidemiologic concept of a `` confounding variable '' that has apparently stood the test of time ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as a second example , @xcite ( @xcite ) had formally considered inference accurate to order @xmath6 in variance conditional on exact or approximate ancillary statistics .",
    "robins showed , surprisingly , that long before their paper , epidemiologists had been intuitively and informally referring to an estimator as `` unbiased '' just when it was asymptotically unbiased conditional on either exact or approximate ancillary statistics ; furthermore , they intuitively required that the associated conditional wald confidence interval be accurate to @xmath7 in variance .",
    "as a third example , he solved the problem of constructing the tightest wald - type intervals guaranteed to have conservative coverage for the average causal effect among the @xmath8 study subjects participating in a completely randomized experiment with a binary response variable ; he showed that this interval can be strictly narrower than the usual binomial interval even under the neyman null hypothesis of no average causal effect .",
    "to do so , he constructed an estimator of the variance of the empirical difference in treatment means that improved on a variance estimator earlier proposed by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) have recently generalized this result in several directions including to nonbinary responses .",
    "it was also in 1982 that robins turned his attention to the subject that would become his grail : causal inference from complex longitudinal data with time - varying treatments , that eventually culminated in his revolutionary papers @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "his interest in this topic was sparked by ( i ) a paper of @xcite ( @xcite ) on the healthy worker survivor effect in occupational epidemiology , wherein the author raised a number of questions robins answered in these papers and ( ii ) his medical experience of trying to optimally adjust a patient s treatments in response to the evolution of the patient s clinical and laboratory data .",
    "robins career from this point on became a `` quest '' to solve this problem , and thereby provide methods that would address central epidemiological questions , for example , _ is a given long - term exposure harmful or a treatment beneficial ? _ _ if beneficial , what interventions , that is , treatment strategies , are optimal or near optimal ? _    in the process , robins created a `` bestiary '' of causal models and analytic methods .",
    "there are the basic `` phyla '' consisting of the g - formula , marginal structural models and structural nested models .",
    "these phyla then contain `` species , '' for example , structural nested failure time models , structural nested distribution models , structural nested ( multiplicative additive and logistic ) mean models and yet further `` subspecies '' : direct - effect structural nested models and optimal - regime structural nested models .",
    "each subsequent model in this taxa was developed to help answer particular causal questions in specific contexts that the `` older siblings '' were not quite up to .",
    "thus , for example , robins creation of structural nested and marginal structural models was driven by the so - called null paradox , which could lead to falsely finding a treatment effect where none existed , and was a serious nonrobustness of the estimated g - formula , his then current methodology . similarly , his research on higher - order influence function estimators was motivated by a concern that , in the presence of confounding by continuous , high dimensional confounders , even doubly robust methods might fail to adequately control for confounding bias .",
    "this variety also reflects robins belief that the best analytic approach varies with the causal question to be answered , and , even more importantly , that confidence in one s substantive findings only comes when multiple , nearly orthogonal , modeling strategies lead to the same conclusion .",
    "suppose one wishes to estimate from longitudinal data the causal effect of time - varying treatment or exposure , say cigarette smoking , on a failure time outcome such as all - cause mortality . in this",
    "setting , a  time - dependent confounder is a time - varying covariate ( e.g. ,  presence of emphysema ) that is a predictor of both future exposure and of failure . in 1982 ,",
    "the standard analytic approach was to model the conditional probability ( i.e. , the hazard ) of failure time @xmath0 as a function of past exposure history using a time - dependent cox proportional hazards model .",
    "robins formally showed that , even when confounding by unmeasured factors and model specification are absent , this approach may result in estimates of effect that may fail to have a causal interpretation , regardless of whether or not one also adjusts for the measured time - dependent confounders in the analysis . in fact , if previous exposure also predicts the subsequent evolution of the time - dependent confounders ( e.g. ,  since smoking is a cause of emphysema , it predicts this disease ) then the standard approach can find an artifactual exposure effect even under the sharp null hypothesis of no net , direct or indirect effect of exposure on the failure time of any subject .",
    "prior to @xcite ( @xcite ) , although informal discussions of net , direct and indirect ( i.e. ,  mediated ) effects of time varying exposures were to be found in the discussion sections of most epidemiologic papers , no formal mathematical definitions existed . to address this",
    ", @xcite ( @xcite ) introduced a new counterfactual model , the _ finest fully randomized causally interpreted structured tree graph _",
    "( ffrcistg ) model that extended the point treatment counterfactual model of @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) to longitudinal studies with time - varying treatments , direct and indirect effects and feedback of one cause on another . due to his lack of formal statistical training ,",
    "the notation and formalisms in @xcite ( @xcite ) differ from those found in the mainstream literature ; as a consequence the paper can be a difficult read .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , appendix c ) present the ffrcistg model using a more familiar notation.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    , @xmath9 , a response @xmath10 measured prior to @xmath9 , and a final response @xmath11 .",
    "blue circles indicate evolution of the process determined by nature ; red dots indicate potential treatment choices . ]",
    "we illustrate the basic ideas using a simplified example .",
    "suppose that we obtain data from an observational or randomized study in which @xmath8 patients are treated at two times .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the treatments .",
    "let @xmath10 be a measurement taken just prior to the second treatment and let @xmath11 be a final outcome , higher values of which are desirable . to simplify matters",
    ", for now we will suppose that all of the treatments and responses are binary . as a concrete example , consider a study of hiv infected subjects with @xmath14 , respectively , being binary indicators of anti - retroviral treatment at time  @xmath1 , high cd4 count just before time @xmath15 , anti - retroviral therapy at time @xmath15 , and survival at time @xmath16 ( where for simplicity we assume no deaths prior to assignment of @xmath9 ) .",
    "there are @xmath17 possible observed data sequences for @xmath14 ; these may be depicted as an event tree as in figure  [ fig : event - tree] .. 2pt . in that case , the analysis in the text is to be understood as being with a given joint stratum of a set of baseline covariates sufficient to adjust for confounding due to baseline factors . ]",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) referred to such event trees as `` structured tree graphs . ''",
    "we wish to assess the effect of the two treatments @xmath18 on @xmath11 . in more detail , for a given subject",
    "we suppose the existence of four potential @xmath19 for @xmath20 which are the outcome a patient would have if ( possibly counter - to - fact ) they were to receive the treatments @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ". then @xmath23 $ ] is the mean outcome ( e.g. ,  the survival probability ) if everyone in the population were to receive the specified level of the two treatments .",
    "the particular instance of this regime under which everyone is treated at both times , so @xmath24 , is depicted in figure  [ fig : event - tree - reg](a ) .",
    "we are interested in estimation of these four means since the regime @xmath25 that maximizes @xmath23 $ ] is the regime a new patient exchangeable with the @xmath8 study subjects should follow .",
    "there are two extreme scenarios : if in an observational study , the treatments are assigned , for example , by doctors , based on additional unmeasured predictors @xmath26 of @xmath11 then @xmath23 $ ] is not identified since those receiving @xmath25 within the study are not representative of the population as a whole .    at the other extreme ,",
    "if the data comes from a completely randomized clinical trial ( rct ) in which treatment is assigned independently at each time by the flip of coin , then it is simple to see that the counterfactual @xmath27 is independent of the treatments @xmath28 and that the average potential outcomes are identified since those receiving @xmath25 in the study are a simple random sample of the whole population .",
    "thus , @xmath29 & = & e [ y\\mid a_{1 } = a_{1},a_{2 } = a_{2 } ] , \\label{eq : asscaus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the right - hand side of ( [ eq : asscaus ] ) is a function of the observed data distribution . in a completely randomized experiment ,",
    "association is causation : the associational quantity on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : asscaus ] ) equals the causal quantity on the left - hand side .",
    "robins , however , considered an intermediate trial design in which both treatments are randomized , but the probability of receiving @xmath13 is dependent on both the treatment received initially ( @xmath12 ) and the observed response ( @xmath10 ) ; a scenario now termed a _ sequential randomized trial_. robins viewed his analysis as also applicable to observational data as follows . in an observational study , the role of an epidemiologist is to use subject matter knowledge to try to collect in @xmath10 sufficient data to eliminate confounding by unmeasured factors , and thus to have the study mimic a sequential rct .",
    "if successful , the only difference between an actual sequential randomized trial and an observational study is that in the former the randomization probabilities @xmath30 are known by design while in the latter they must be estimated from the data .",
    "robins viewed the sequential randomized trial as a collection of five trials in total : the original trial at @xmath31 , plus a set of four randomized trials at @xmath32 nested within the original trial .",
    "are on study populations defined by specific @xmath33-histories .",
    "] let the counterfactual @xmath34 be the outcome @xmath10 when @xmath12 is set to @xmath21 .",
    "since the counterfactuals @xmath19 and @xmath34 do not depend on the actual treatment received , they can be viewed , like a subject s genetic make - up , as a fixed ( possibly unobserved ) characteristic of a subject and therefore independent of the randomly assigned treatment conditional on pre - randomization covariates .",
    "that is , for each @xmath25 and @xmath35 : @xmath36    these independences suffice to identify the joint density @xmath37 of @xmath38 from the distribution of the factual variables by the `` g - computation algorithm formula '' ( or simply _",
    "g - formula _ ) density @xmath39 provided the conditional probabilities on the right - hand side are well - defined ( @xcite , @xcite , page 1423 ) .",
    "note that @xmath40 is obtained from the joint density of the factuals by removing the treatment terms @xmath41 .",
    "this is in - line with the intuition that @xmath12 and @xmath13 cease to be random since , under the regime , they are set by intervention to constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the g - formula was later referred to as the `` manipulated density '' by @xcite ( @xcite ) and the `` truncated factorization '' by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",

    "is a generalization of standardization of effect measures to time varying treatments .",

    "@xmath11_. is no longer identified under this weaker assumption . ]",
    "furthermore , he provided substantive examples of observational studies in which only the weaker assumption would be expected to hold .",
    "it is much easier to describe these studies using representations of causal systems using directed acyclic graphs and single world intervention graphs , neither of which existed when ( @xcite ) was written .",
    "causal dags were first introduced in the seminal work of @xcite ( @xcite ) ; the theory was subsequently developed and extended by @xcite ( @xcite ) among others .",
    "a causal dag with random variables @xmath44 as nodes is a graph in which ( 1 ) the lack of an arrow from node @xmath45 to @xmath46 can be interpreted as the absence of a direct causal effect of @xmath45 on @xmath46 ( relative to the other variables on the graph ) , ( 2 ) all common causes , even if unmeasured , of any pair of variables on the graph are themselves on the graph , and ( 3 ) the causal markov assumption ( cma ) holds . the cma links the causal structure represented by the directed acyclic graph ( dag ) to the statistical data obtained in a study .",
    "it states that the distribution of the factual variables factor according to the dag . a distribution factors according to the dag if nondescendants of a given variable @xmath45 are independent of @xmath45 conditional on @xmath47 , the parents of @xmath45 .",
    "the cma is mathematically equivalent to the statement that the density @xmath48 of the variables on the causal dag @xmath49 satisfies the markov factorization @xmath50 a graphical criterion , called d - separation ( @xcite ) , characterizes all the marginal and conditional independences that hold in every distribution obeying the markov factorization ( [ eq : dag - factor ] ) .",
    "causal dags may also be used to represent the joint distribution of the observed data under the counterfactual ffrcistg model of @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "this follows because an ffrcistg model over the variables @xmath51 induces a distribution that factors as ( [ eq : dag - factor ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : seq - rand](a ) shows a causal directed acyclic graph ( dag ) corresponding to the sequentially randomized experiment described above : vertex @xmath52 represents an unmeasured common cause ( e.g. ,  immune function ) of cd4 count @xmath10 and survival @xmath11 .",
    "randomization of treatment implies @xmath12 has no parents and @xmath13 has only the observed variables @xmath12 and @xmath10 as parents .",
    "single - world intervention graphs ( swigs ) , introduced in ( @xcite ) , provide a simple way to derive the counterfactual independence relations implied by an ffrcistg model .",
    "swigs were designed to unify the graphical and potential outcome approaches to causality .",
    "the nodes on a swig are the counterfactual random variables associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on the treatment variables .",
    "the swig in figure  [ fig : seq - rand](b ) is derived from the causal dag in figure  [ fig : seq - rand](a ) corresponding to a sequentially randomized experiment .",

    "formaldehyde is a known eye - irritant .",
    "the presence of an arrow from @xmath54 to @xmath12 but not from @xmath54 to @xmath13 reflects the fact that subjects who believe their eyes to be sensitive to formaldehyde are given the discretion to choose a job without formaldehyde exposure at time of hire but not later .",

    "this algorithm strictly extends the set of causal identification results obtained by robins for static regimes .",
    "the `` g '' in `` g - formula '' and elsewhere in robins work refers to generalized treatment regimes @xmath65 .",

    "consequently , identification can only be achieved by correctly specifying ( sufficiently restrictive ) parametric models for  @xmath136 .",
    "if we are unwilling to rely on such parametric assumptions , then the observed data distribution only implies bounds for the @xmath136 s .",
    "in particular , in the setting of a point treatment randomized trial with noncompliance and the instrument @xmath137 being the assigned treatment , @xcite ( @xcite ) obtained bounds on the average causal effect @xmath138 $ ] of the received treatment @xmath139 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this paper was the first to derive bounds for nonidentified causal effects defined through potential outcomes .",

    "@xcite ( @xcite ) noted that there exist causal questions for which snms are not altogether satisfactory .",
    "as an example , for @xmath11 binary , @xcite ( @xcite ) proposed a structural nested logistic model in order to ensure estimates of the counterfactual mean of @xmath11 were between zero and one .",
    "however , he noted that knowledge of the randomization probabilities did not allow one to construct unbiased estimating function for its parameter @xmath102 .",
    "more importantly , snms do not directly model the final object of public health interest  the distribution or mean of the outcome @xmath11 as function of the regimes  @xmath65as these distributions are generally functions not only of the parameters of the snm but also of the conditional law of the time dependent covariates @xmath10 given the past history .",

    "marginal structural models grew out of robins work on censoring and _ inverse probability of censoring weighted _",
    "( ipcw ) estimators .",
    "robins work on dependent censoring was motivated by the familiar clinical observation that patients who did not return to the clinic and were thus censored differed from other patients on important risk factors , for example measures of cardio - pulmonary reserve . in the 1970s and 1980s , the analysis of right censored data was a major area of statistical research , driven by the introduction of the proportional hazards model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and by martingale methods for their analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this research , however , was focused on independent censoring .",

    "@xcite ( @xcite , page 1491 ) recognized that the converse was indeed also true : a missing data problem could be viewed as a problem in counterfactual causal inference .",
    "robins conceptualized right censoring as just another time dependent `` treatment '' @xmath62 and one s inferential goal as the estimation of the outcome @xmath11 under the static regime  @xmath65 `` never censored . ''",
    "inference based on the g - formula was then licensed provided that censoring was explainable in the sense that ( [ eq : statrand ] ) holds .",
    "this approach to dependent censoring subsumed independent censoring as the latter is a special case of the former .",
    "robins , however , recognized once again that inference based on the estimated g - formula could be nonrobust . to overcome this difficulty , @xcite introduced ipcw tests and estimators whose properties are easiest to explain in the context of a two - armed rct of a single treatment ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the standard intention - to - treat ( itt ) analysis for comparing the survival distributions in the two arms is a log - rank test .",
    "however , data are often collected on covariates , both pre- and post - randomization , that are predictive of the outcome as well as ( possibly ) of censoring .",
    "an itt analysis that tries to adjust for dependent - censoring by ipcw uses estimates of the arm - specific hazards of censoring as functions of past covariate history .",

    "first , if censoring is dependent but explainable by the covariates , the log - rank test is not asymptotically valid .",
    "in contrast , ipcw tests asymptotically reject at their nominal level provided the arm - specific hazard estimators are consistent .",
    "second , when censoring is independent , although both the ipcw tests and the log - rank test asymptotically reject at their nominal level , the ipcw tests , by making use of covariates , can be more powerful than the log - rank test even against proportional - hazards alternatives . even under independent censoring tests based on the estimated g - formula",

    "msms are not restricted to models for the dependence of the mean of @xmath19 on @xmath83 .",

    "thus , perhaps not surprisingly , all three of the distinct direct effect concepts that are now an integral part of the causal literature are all to be found in his early papers .",
    "intuitively , all the notions of direct effect consider whether `` the outcome ( @xmath11 ) would have been different had cause ( @xmath12 ) been different , but the level of ( @xmath13 ) remained unchanged . ''",
    "the notions differ regarding the precise meaning of @xmath9 `` remained unchanged .

    "<S> robins majored in mathematics at harvard college , but then , in the spirit of the times , left college to pursue more activist social and political goals . </S>",

    "<S> unable to find a job and with his unemployment insurance running out , he surprisingly was able to obtain a prestigious residency in internal medicine at yale university , a testament , he says with some irony , to the enduring strength of one s ivy league connections .    at yale , </S>",
    "<S> robins and his college friend mark cullen , now head of general medicine at stanford medical school , founded an occupational health clinic , with the goal of working with trade unions in promoting occupational health and safety . </S>",
    "<S> when testifying in workers compensation cases , robins was regularly asked whether it was `` more probable than not that a worker s death or illness was _ caused _ by exposure to chemicals in the workplace . '' </S>",
    "<S> robins lifelong interest in causal inference began with his need to provide an answer . </S>",
    "<S> as the relevant scientific papers consisted of epidemiologic studies and biostatistical analyses , robins enrolled in biostatistics and epidemiology classes at yale . he was dismayed to learn that the one question he needed to answer was the one question excluded from formal discussion in the mainstream biostatistical literature . </S>",
