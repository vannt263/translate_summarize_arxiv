    "understanding the properties of water around hydrophobic solutes , which are mainly determined by the hydrogen bond ( hb ) network , is crucial since the rotational and translational motion of water molecules in solution control the rates of important chemical and biochemical processes,@xcite such as protein folding and membrane assembly .",
    "basically , the hydrophobic effect represents the tendency of apolar groups to associate in aqueous solutions and minimize the total surface that is exposed to water ; instead polar groups can participate in hbs with water molecules .",
    "in particular , the aqueous solution properties of methane have long been of interest : in fact , methane is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule and represents a good model compound for understanding the properties of water molecules in the solvation shell of small apolar solutes .",
    "methane - water systems play also an important role in various fields of the natural sciences , ranging from fossil fuel chemistry to reactions in the conversion of solar energy ( thermochemistry ) , to methane production from fermentation of farm wastes.@xcite    it is now generally believed that the nature of hydrophobicity is size dependent:@xcite small apolar molecules such as methane have a hydration free energy near ambient conditions that is largely entropic ; that is , it depends more on the number of ways all of the water molecules in the methane hydration shell can form hbs rather than their energies .",
    "water molecules in the vicinity of small non - polar solutes are capable@xcite of rearranging themselves in such a way to encapsulate the guest molecule and to regenerate any hbs broken during the insertion of the solute , so that a non - polar solute can be thought of as a `` structure maker'';@xcite it is then possible to describe hydrophobic hydration in terms of the directional , hydrogen bonding properties of water , which undergoes a restricted orientational freedom due to the inability of the solute to participate in hbs , which makes certain orientations of the hydration shell water molecules energetically unfavourable.@xcite    in spite of the importance of the subject a detailed , microscopic understanding of water dynamics in vicinity to an apolar solute remains elusive and different mechanisms have been conjectured .",
    "it was suggested@xcite that hydrophobic solutes enforce the network of h - bonded water molecules around them and strongly decrease their mobility , in such a way that they form rigid , icelike structures ( `` icebergs '' ) .",
    "however , several experimental and computational studies showed that , at least at low solute concentration around room temperature , the structure and dynamics of the water molecules in the solvation shell is similar to that of bulk water.@xcite nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and dielectric relaxation ( dr ) experiments@xcite indicated that the mobility of water molecules in solutions containing hydrophobic solutes is decreased , however , since these methods can only measure a response averaged over all water molecules , it was not clear whether well - defined layers of `` immobilized '' water molecules exist or instead there are many molecules slightly affected in their dynamical behavior .",
    "recent results by rezus and bakker,@xcite obtained by using femtosecond midinfrared spectroscopy ( fs - ir ) to investigate the hydration of hydrophobic groups on a subpicosecond time scale ( experiments@xcite use `` ultrashort''-infrared pulses with durations of the order of 50 fs ) , have been interpreted as a confirmation that water molecules surrounding hydrophobic groups undergo a much slower orientational dynamics than the bulk liquid and are therefore effectively immobilized ; in particular , it is suggested that each methyl group is surrounded by 4 immobilized waters , supporting the `` iceberg '' picture in a _ dynamical _ way : although the water molecules around hydrophobic groups have a liquidlike structures , their dynamics would be icelike , which also explains why hydrophobic icebergs were not previously observed with structural methods .",
    "the major experimental problem in the nmr measurements of water - methane systems is due to the low solubility of methane in water ; in readily accessible proton spectra a large proton water peak would effectively mask the signal from small amounts of dissolved methane.@xcite computer simulations can give very detailed information about the solvation structure , providing detailed mechanistic insights that can not be directly obtained from experiments . in one of the first classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of methane - water systems , laaksonen and stilbs@xcite found that the dynamics of the solvent water molecules is slowed down ( by about a 1.5 factor in the reorientational correlation time ) : in particular ,",
    "the reorientational motion is sensitive to the presence of methane in solution ; the simulated translational diffusion of methanes as solutes is also slowed down , but is higher than observed experimentally .",
    "moreover , methane acts nearly as a free rotor.@xcite    subsequent classical md simulations@xcite supported the idea that a moderate slowing down of water dynamics around hydrophobic groups arises from a steric effect , with a consequent decrease in the configurational space available to water molecules around hydrophobic solutes .",
    "interestingly , stirnemann _",
    "et al._,@xcite investigated the hb dynamics of water in a series of amphiphilic solute solutions ( solute molecules possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties ) through classical md simulations and analytic modeling : they find that for most solutes the major effect in the hydration dynamics comes from the hydrophilic groups that can retard the water dynamics much more significantly ( the retardation factor being about 1.4 ) than can hydrophobic groups by forming strong hbs with water ; by contrast , hydrophobic groups are shown to have a very moderate effect on water hb breaking kinetics via an excluded volume effect.@xcite this interpretation is in contrast with , for instance , that of bakulin _",
    "et al._@xcite who studied solvation of tetramethylurea and other amphiphilic solutes , and attribute the retarded spectral relaxation observed in the experimental spectra to a dramatic slowdown in the water dynamics induced by the hydrophobic groups , due to the suppression of water jumps between hb acceptors : in particular , due to a steric effect , the fifth water molecule which is required to form a defect state in the tetrahedral surroundings ( with the temporary formation of a bifurcated hb ) , can not approach the h - bonded pair to initiate the molecular jump ; as a results , the rate of the jumping events sharply decreases , which , in turn , strongly slows the rotation of the water molecules.@xcite therefore , the effect of hydrophobic groups would be twofold : they do not only exclude part of the volume available for switching but fundamentally change the hb dynamics of the solvating water molecules ; this can be associated with the formation of a more `` rigid '' water - solute structure where the translational mobility decreases ; this explanation is supported by the suppressed translational mobility of water and its excellent correlation to hb dynamics.@xcite bakulin _ et al._@xcite interpret their results as a demonstration that the hydrophilic part of the molecules does not play an important role in the water hb dynamics .",
    "note , however , that the strong slowing down of the reorientation in the hydrophobic hydration shells is not reproduced by md simulations:@xcite for instance , in a classical md study ( using spc / e water ) the reorientation of oh groups tangential to hydrophobic methyl groups was calculated to slow down only by a factor of about 1.4 at low solute concentrations.@xcite on the basis of these observations and controversial interpretations , it appears to be extremely useful to perform accurate first principles simulations to study a system where hydrophilic groups are absent in such a way to investigate the effect of a hydrophobic group only .",
    "in fact , md simulations based on empirical force fields , specifically designed to reproduce selected experimental data or a limited set of quantum chemically computed structures , do not provide a description completely independent from reference data and the reliability of the results , at conditions significantly different from those where the potential was designed for , may be questionable .",
    "these limitations can be overcome by car - parrinello md simulations , where the interactions are calculated from first principles , and that have been already used in studies of liquid water,@xcite aqueous solvation,@xcite and nucleic acid models containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups.@xcite with respect to force - field based md , first principles md has important advantages : it naturally incorporates polarization , it accounts for the intramolecular motion , and gives detailed information on the electronic properties such as the charge distribution .",
    "we have recently studied@xcite the interaction of water with methanol ( the simplest alcohol ) , which can be considered as a prototype of a solute with both hydrophobic ( methyl ) and hydrophilic ( hydroxyl ) groups : we found that the presence of a methanol molecule slightly reduces the mobility of many water molecules , rather than immobilizing just the few ones which are closest to the methyl group , in line with the interpretation of qvist and halle@xcite and with classical md simulation results.@xcite here we study , from first principles , the interaction of water with methane which can be considered as a prototype of an hydrophobic solute .",
    "a previous first principles study of a water - methane solution exists , which was however limited to the investigation of electronic properties and polarization effects.@xcite",
    "density functional theory ( dft)-based car - parrinello ( cp ) md simulations@xcite have been performed at constant volume , starting with the experimental density of water at room temperature .",
    "the initial system consists of 64 equilibrated water molecules in a supercell with body - centered - cubic symmetry@xcite and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "subsequently , two adjacent water molecules have been replaced by a methane molecule , the resulting solution system being characterized by a density of 0.98 g/@xmath0 , in line with the typical density considered in previous simulations.@xcite then the novel system has been reequilibrated for 2 ps to allow water molecules to reorganize and form the solvation shell around the solute .",
    "then statistics have been collected for about 20 ps , while the temperature of the system has been controlled by a nos - hoover chain thermostat@xcite on the ionic degrees of freedom . for comparison with the properties of pure water , a parallel simulation with a system of 64 water molecules at the same conditions , has been performed . in line with the approach followed in recent simulations,@xcite",
    "the chosen target simulation temperatures were higher than the room temperature of actual experiments , since standard dft functionals ( such as the pbe adopted here ) are known to be affected by a slight overbinding leading to a sort of `` glassy behavior '' of the dynamics around room temperature,@xcite which is probably partially related to the neglect of proton quantum effects@xcite and to the well - known deficiencies of standard dft approaches in describing van der waals interactions;@xcite note that the lack of an accurate description of the van der waals interactions in the solvation of small hydrophobic molecules is however expected to have little influence on the surrounding water structure.@xcite according to extensive tests@xcite on liquid water simulations with the pbe functional , a 400 k temperature guarantees a liquid - like dynamical behavior of the pure - water system . in order",
    "to both directly verify this conclusion and also test its validity for aqueous solution systems , we have performed first principles cp simulations by selecting target average temperatures of 330 , 400 , and 460 k for pure water , and 400 and 460 k for the water - methane solution .",
    "h nuclei were treated as classical particles with the mass of deuterium which allows us to use larger time steps,@xcite and the effective mass for the fictitious dynamics of the electrons was 700 a.u . with a md time step of 0.121 fs ; such an electronic fictitious mass is within the range suggested ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 a.u . for h@xmath3o and d@xmath3o , respectively ) to get an accurate description of the electronic ground state and reliable structural and dynamical properties.@xcite the number ( 62 ) of solvent water molecules is expected to be sufficient , since both experiments@xcite and previous simulations@xcite indicate that solute - induced perturbations are short - ranged .",
    "the computations were performed at the @xmath4-point only of the brillouin zone , using norm - conserving troullier - martins@xcite pseudopotentials with a plane - wave cutoff of 80 ry and the gradient - corrected pbe density functional,@xcite which gives@xcite a good description of h bonding in liquid water .",
    "concerning the structural properties , in fig .",
    "1 we show our computed o - o pair correlation function , @xmath5 , of pure water at the different temperatures considered in the present simulations , while in fig .",
    "2 we report the @xmath5 and @xmath6 functions of the water - methane solution , at 400 and 460 k , compared to the corresponding functions obtained for the water - methanol solution at 400 k.@xcite as expected , the amplitude of the fluctuations of all the pair correlation functions decreases by increasing the temperature ; note that our @xmath5 functions computed for pure water ( fig .",
    "1 ) at 400 and 460 k are closer to the experimental@xcite @xmath5 , obtained at room temperature , than our @xmath5 at 330 k , thus confirming that higher simulation temperatures somehow mimic the missing van der waals and nuclear effects . moreover , the @xmath5 functions of the solutions are more structured ( fig .",
    "2 ) than that relative to pure water at the same temperature , in line with the conclusions of previous studies;@xcite a similar behavior can be also observed for the o - h and h - h pair correlation functions ( not shown ) .",
    "the basic structural data ( positions and height of the first maximum and first minimum of the pair correlation functions , and coordination number ) are listed in tables i and ii , relative to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 function , respectively .",
    "similarly to the case of aqueous solvation of methanol,@xcite the distribution of water o atoms around the c atom of methane is characterized by a broad first peak , located between 3 and 5   ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating the existence of a solvation shell of about 20 water molecules , in agreement with classical md simulations.@xcite the structure of the methane - water solution in the first hydration shell of methane is determined by a competition between weak methane - water and significantly stronger water - water interactions .",
    "@xcite a water molecule is defined@xcite to be in the hydration shell if it is within the first minimum of the methane molecule ( around 5.4  ) ; bulk molecules are instead those outside the shell . using the ratio of heights of the first maximum and the following minimum of the @xmath5 pair correlation function as a measure of the degree of structure,@xcite looking at table i , one can see that it obviously decreases for pure water by increasing the simulation temperature ; moreover , with respect to pure water , at 400 k , it is a 2.2 factor larger for the water - methane solution and a 1.3 factor larger for the water - methanol system , and , at 460 k , it is a 1.2 factor larger for the water - methane solution .",
    "as suggested elsewhere,@xcite the enhanced structure of the o - o pair correlation functions reflects the fact that water is excluded from the region occupied by the solute molecule and does not indicate an increase in water - water structure .",
    "the fraction of molecules participating in a given number of hbs has been also evaluated.@xcite clearly we focus attention on the water molecules located within the solvation shell , this being a meaningful identification procedure since the net displacement of both a typical solvent molecule and of the solute during the simulation is relatively small . in line with",
    "previous findings@xcite the water molecules near the apolar methane molecule turn out to have essentially the same average number of hbs as do the others ( see table v ) ; since the average distances and angles relative to these hbs are very similar to those in the bulk , one infers that even the hb strength is not significantly different . looking at table i one can see that the nearest neighbor o - o distance is essentially the same in pure water and in the solutions , if comparison is made at the same simulation temperature .",
    "this confirms the results of neutron scattering studies which suggest that hydrophobic solutes have surprising little effect on the o - o distances,@xcite so that it appears that water molecules can change their hb dynamics and partially lose their reorientation ability without strongly disrupting the local structure.@xcite the small changes in the structure of the solvating water shell around methane and methanol indicate that the hb water network is very flexible and can easily accommodate small apolar solute groups without significantly changing its structure , in agreement with previous studies.@xcite the low aqueous solubility of methane makes experimental studies of this system difficult : estimates of the oc coordination number , @xmath716 and 19 have been calculated from the methane carbon - water oxygen pair correlation function determined from neutron diffraction .",
    "results from computer simulations@xcite indicate that @xmath8 is in the range 16 - 22 .",
    "the chemical shifts in nmr spectra of aqueous methane can be used to measure the number of water molecules in the first hydration sphere of methane because the chemical shift is a measure of the size of the hydrophobic cage around methane : in such a way it was found that @xmath720,@xcite in good agreement with our findings .",
    "the orientations of the water molecules relative to the methane molecule can be analyzed by computing the angle @xmath9 subtended by the vector joining the c atom of methane to the o of a water molecule with the vector between the o and a h atom of the water molecule .",
    "for the water - methane solution , both at 400 and 460 k , we find @xmath10 degrees , for the water molecules within the solvation shell of methane , which corresponds to an essential tangential orientation of water molecules with respect to the solute s surface .",
    "this type of arrangement agrees with previous classical md estimates@xcite and allows water molecules to straddle the surface of the solute and maintain a nearly tetrahedral hb coordination as found in bulk water .",
    "more relevant to the comparison with recent experiments is the analysis of the dynamical properties .",
    "our estimated diffusion coefficients ( computed by mean - square displacement and relative to the o atoms of the water molecules ) in pure water and aqueous solutions are reported in table iii . as can be seen , in pure water the diffusion coefficient , @xmath11 , at the simulation temperature of 400 k",
    "is close to the experimental value@xcite of bulk liquid heavy water at room temperature , thus confirming that this simulation temperature is adequate to reproduce effective room - temperature conditions ( at the simulation temperature of 330 k @xmath11 is instead much smaller than the reference value ) .",
    "for the water - methanol solution at 400 k @xmath11 is only moderately smaller than in pure water , in agreement with previous simulations@xcite that predicted a slower translational diffusion of water in solution .",
    "however , for the water - methane system , at 400 k @xmath11 is much smaller than the corresponding value of pure water at the same temperature and is close to @xmath11 of pure water at 330 k , thus suggesting that this strong water mobility reduction is probably not a genuine physical effect but instead a consequence of the artificial `` glassy behavior '' of the dynamics discussed above . at 460 k the @xmath11 value of water - methane exhibits instead only a moderate reduction with respect to pure water at the same temperature , similarly to the case of water - methanol at 400 k and in line with the common expectations .",
    "these observations suggest that the simulation temperature of 460 k is more suitable for a proper comparison between the properties of the water - methane solution and those of pure water .    among the available dynamical observables , the molecule rotational correlation time represents a particularly useful probe of the hydration shell because of its strong dependence on the local hb configuration ( in bulk water molecular rotation occurs by a concerted mechanism where hbs are simultaneously broken and reformed@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the rotational motion can be studied by looking at the orientational correlation functions , given by    @xmath12 > \\ ; , \\label{orient}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a unit vector along the molecular dipole moment or the hoh angle bisector of the water molecules .",
    "these orientational correlation functions can be related to experimental measurements and different techniques are sensitive to the first or second order dipole correlation function:@xcite dr and thz time domain spectroscopy probe the decay of @xmath16 , while fs - ir ( the technique used by rezus and bakker@xcite ) , nmr , and optical kerr - effect spectroscopy probe the decay of @xmath17 . by assuming an exponential decay of the @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "functions one can easily estimate , by a fitting and/or integration procedure ( see , for instance , ref . ) , the corresponding reorientation times , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are reported in table iv .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath17 relative to pure water and water - methane solution at 400 and 460 k ( the corresponding figure , relative to water - methanol was already reported and discussed in ref . ) .",
    "as can be seen , all the functions exhibit an initial rapid decay during the first half ps , which can be attributed@xcite to overall molecular oscillation ( libration ) with a loss of phase memory , but without significant net reorientation , keeping the hbs intact . by considering that the experimental anisotropy function is given by @xmath20,@xcite our computed @xmath17 curve , at 460 k ,",
    "resembles the time - dependent anisotropy measured , at low concentration , with pump - probe spectroscopy ( see , for instance , fig . 1 of ref . and fig . 3 of ref .",
    ") . in qualitative agreement with previous classical md simulations,@xcite the decay of @xmath17 , at 460 k ,",
    "is found to be not much slower in solution than in pure water , without any noticeable plateau ; instead , at 400 k , the decay of our computed @xmath17 turns out to be much slower in the water - methane solution than in bulk water .",
    "the reorientation times ( see table iv ) , estimated from the analysis of the @xmath17 functions , relative to all the water molecules , and , for the solutions , also to bulk waters , solvation - shell water molecules , and the 4 waters closest to methanol or methane ( roughly corresponding to integration of the @xmath6 pair correlation function up to the position of the first maximum ) , are only slightly longer than that in pure water if comparison is done between water - methanol and pure water at 400 k and between water - methane and pure water at 460 k. in line with the behavior of the diffusion coefficient discussed above and with the slow decay of the @xmath17 function shown in fig .",
    "3 , the reorientation times of the water - methane solution at 400 k appear to be instead much larger than in pure water , thus strengthining the conclusion that the system is characterized by an artificial `` glassy behavior '' at that simulation temperature . at the temperature of 460 k comparison with pure water properties",
    "indicate a much more reasonable behavior , thus indicating that the proper effective simulation temperature to be used to reproduce ambient condition properties is not necessarily the same for pure water and for solutions or confined water . as can be seen in table iv , in the solutions there is no significant difference between the retardation of the rotational motion of bulk waters and solvation waters ; only the 4 waters closest to methanol or methane appears to undergo a little more pronounced slowing - down effect .",
    "our predicted moderate slowing down of water molecules around methane and methanol is in good agreement with the results of classical md simulations,@xcite although the absolute values of our estimated reorientation times are significantly shorter than those ( 2.8 - 4.5 ps ) obtained by some simulations@xcite and in better agreement with the data reported by laaksonen and stilbs@xcite and with experimental estimates ( 1.7 - 2.6 ps in pure water@xcite ) , thus confirming that reorientation rates are often overestimated in classical md simulations.@xcite concerning the @xmath21 ratio , its value smaller than 3 , indicates that the reorientation motion of water molecules , both in bulk and in solutions , can not be entirely ascribed to a pure diffusive mechanism , which would lead to a 3 value.@xcite      in table v we report the basic data about the hb structure .",
    "as can be seen , the average number of hbs per water molecule , @xmath22 , slightly increases in solutions compared to the value of pure water at the same simulation temperature .",
    "moreover , as already pointed out above , the average number of the four water molecules closest to the methane molecule does not much differ from ( and in any case is not smaller than ) that of the other waters .",
    "the fraction of broken hbs can be defined@xcite as @xmath23 , where @xmath22 is the average number of hbs per water molecule .",
    "we find that , at 400k , @xmath24 for pure water , water - methanol , and water - methane , respectively , while , at 460k @xmath25 for pure water and water - methane , respectively , thus confirming again that small solutes like methanol and methane not only do not disrupt the hb structure of bulk water but they even show a tendency to enhance it since the fraction of broken hbs is slightly reduced in the aqueous solutions .",
    "in bulk liquid water the reorientation of water molecules involves large angular jumps and proceeds through a concerted mechanism in which a rotating water molecule breaks a hb with an overcoordinated first neighbor , while forming a new bond with an undercoordinated molecule initially located on the inner side of the second solvation shell ( with typical energy barriers of the order of 4 kcal / mol).@xcite experiments and simulations for pure water have led to a detailed picture of water motion at very short times ( less than 100 fs ) , followed by rotational jumps and hb making and breaking at longer times ( of the order of 1 - 2 ps ) : the hb exchange mechanism occurs by means of large ( about 60 degrees ) , very fast ( about 200 fs ) but relatively seldom ( once in 2 - 3 ps ) angular jumps corresponding to concerted hb switching events.@xcite",
    "@xcite    in table v we also list the average hb lifetimes , estimated by considering the persistence of all the hb atom pairs during the md trajectory .",
    "as can be seen , the average hb lifetimes of the four water molecules closest to the methane are slightly longer ( by about a 1.1 factor ) than the value of all the waters .",
    "interestingly , the situation is different for aqueous solvation of methanol , which is characterized by the presence of a hydrophilic group too : in fact , the average hb lifetime of the four water molecules closest to the ch@xmath26 group of methanol is marginally shorter that that of all the water molecules .",
    "the longer average hb lifetimes at the interface relative to the interior can be attributed to the lack of cooperative effects in proximity to methane due to the decreased density of water.@xcite in fact , by considering the mechanism of hb exchange,@xcite in order to undergo hb exchange , a water molecule must have a readily available hb partner in the second hydration shell ; at the interface the number of nearest neighbor water molecules decreases ; this reduces the probability of there being a nearby water molecule that may accept a newly formed hb and thus lengthens the lifetime of already formed hbs .",
    "note that the rotational dynamics of water are inherently connected to the hb dynamics , since for the rotational correlation to decay to zero the water - water hb network must lose all correlation with its former state .",
    "these reorientation times therefore are expected to be roughly proportional to the hb lifetimes,@xcite since the hb exchange has been shown to be the main water reorientation pathway.@xcite this expectation is confirmed by our data if one compares the @xmath19 values of table iv to the @xmath27 estimates of table v. clearly , the presence of a hydrophobic group blocks the approach of some new water hb acceptors , thus retarding the jump rate between hb acceptors for surrounding waters;@xcite the jump time increase with increasing solute concentration can be quantitatively described by a transition state excluded - volume model:@xcite the slowdown factor with respect to the bulk is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fraction of transition state locations for the new acceptor which are forbidden by the solutes s presence .",
    "@xcite    in the case of solvation of methane , a methane molecule excludes the centres of water molecules from a spherical volume less than 5   across ; this volume is small enough that its presence in water requires no breaking of hbs : water molecules can adopt orientations that allow hb pattern to go around the solute , and the extent to which bonds are broken at any instant is similar to that in the pure liquid .",
    "@xcite in the case of water - methane at 460 k , by estimating the excluded volume fraction and the consequent retardation factor,@xcite we obtain 0.26 and 1.35 , in good agreement with the predictions ( 0.28 and 1.39 , respectively ) of laage _",
    "et al._@xcite note that this retardation factor matches well with the slowing - down factor ( 1.3 ) derived by the reorientation time analysis thus indicating that the rotational slowing down is compatible with that one predicted on the basis of the excluded volume fraction . as discussed above ,",
    "compared to pure water , the water structure is slightly enhanced in the presence of methane .",
    "of course the enhanced water structure in the first hydration shell implies longer lifetimes for the hbs and , evidently , hindered dynamics : the effect is equivalent as lowering the temperature in the vicinity of the solute,@xcite which could also partially explain the `` glassy behavior '' of the water - methane solution at 400 k.      in contrast to simulations based on semiempirical potentials , first principles schemes yield detailed information also on the electronic charge distributions , which in liquid and aqueous solvation systems can be conveniently elaborated using the maximally localized wannier function ( mlwf ) method.@xcite in condensed phases the selfconsistent internal electric field polarizes the water and solute molecules , leading to a large increase of their molecular dipole moments . using the mlwf scheme,@xcite the dipole moment of a system can be simply calculated by assuming that the electronic charge is concentrated in point charges located at the positions of the wannier function centers .",
    "our computed dipole moments are reported in table vi . in bulk liquid water",
    "the average value of the dipole moment per water molecule is enhanced by about 80 % , with respect to that of the isolated water monomer ( 1.88 d , experimental : 1.86 d ) , this being a typical feature of strongly hb molecules . however , as can be seen , the presence of the solutes affects the distribution of the water - molecule dipole moments : in fact , considering the associated statistical errors , the average dipole moment of water molecules in the solvation shells are significantly smaller than that of the bulk waters ( the effect is more pronounced for methanol , which is understandable since this molecule is also characterized by the presence of a hydrophilic termination ) .",
    "this suggests that the presence of the solute reduces the polarization effects in the solvation - shell waters , which is compatible with the fact that the rotational mobility is not much decreased : in fact one expects that a smaller dipole moment makes the reorientation of water molecules easier , in such a way to partially offset the increased tendency to rigidity of waters in the solvation shell ( water rotation is very fast in the limiting case of water dispersed in an apolar solvent@xcite ) .",
    "clearly such an effect can not be reproduced by most of the classical md simulations where nonpolarizable models for the water molecules ( which are often assumed to be rigid and equal ) are adopted and could explain why the ratio between our estimated reorientation times of waters in solution and in pure water is smaller than that ( 1.5 - 2.0 ) obtained by classical md methods based on rigid force field and instead closer to that ( 1.3 ) given by flexible - force field simulations.@xcite    recently , mateus _",
    "et al._@xcite have investigated the electronic properties of a methane - water solution by a sequential quantum mechanical / md approach and found that , upon hydration , methane acquires an induced dipole moment of @xmath30 d , due to polarisation effects and to weak methane - water hb interactions , a value comparable to our estimates in table vi . mateus _",
    "et al._@xcite found no difference between the average monomeric dipole moment of bulk waters and that of waters in close interaction ( within the first hydration layer of ) with methane ; instead we find a slight reduction .",
    "this difference is probably due the fact that in the simulations of mateus _ et al . _",
    "the geometry of the water molecules was kept rigid while only that of methane was flexible , at variance with our approach .",
    "in conclusion , our results , compatible with recent experiments , shed light on the controversial issue related to the presence of `` immobilized '' water molecules around hydrophobic groups . since there is no evidence that a few waters rotate much more slowly than the others in solution ,",
    "one concludes that the presence of the hydrophobic solute slightly reduces the mobility of many water molecules , rather than immobilizing just the few ones which are closest to the methane molecule , similarly to what obtained by simulations of soluted methanol , and in line with the interpretation of qvist and halle@xcite and with classical md simulation results.@xcite therefore our results are also relevant to validate the classical md approach for modeling of aqueous solutions .",
    "moreover , the rotational slowing down is compatible with that one predicted on the basis of excluded volume fraction , which leads to a slower hydrogen bond - exchange rate . by generating maximally - localized wannier functions ,",
    "a detailed description of the polarization effects in both solute and solvent molecules has been obtained , which better characterizes the solvation process .",
    "finally , the analysis of simulations performed at different temperatures suggests that the target temperature of the soluted system must be carefully chosen , in order to avoid artificial slowing - down effects .",

    "<S> structural , dynamical , bonding , and electronic properties of water molecules around a soluted methane molecule are studied from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compatible with experiments and qualitatively support the conclusions of recent classical molecular dynamics simulations concerning the controversial issue on the presence of `` immobilized '' water molecules around hydrophobic groups : the hydrophobic solute slightly reduces ( by a less than 2 factor ) the mobility of many surrounding water molecules rather than immobilizing just the few ones which are closest to methane , similarly to what obtained by previous first - principles simulations of soluted methanol . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the rotational slowing down is compatible with that one predicted on the basis of the excluded volume fraction , which leads to a slower hydrogen bond - exchange rate . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of simulations performed at different temperatures suggests that the target temperature of the soluted system must be carefully chosen , in order to avoid artificial slowing - down effects . by generating maximally - localized wannier functions , </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the polarization effects in both solute and solvent molecules is obtained , which better characterizes the solvation process . </S>"
