    "multiresolution or wavelet analysis ( mra ) @xcite is increasingly used in advanced data compression and image coding algorithms @xcite , and several promising approaches applied this technique in describing electronic structures .",

    "( dft ) method , goedecker and ivanov @xcite have also successfully used wavelets for the solution of poisson s equation .",
    "there are also attempts to extend wavelet calculations to three dimensional structures in a computationally manageable manner @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of the application of mra is the recognition that the details of the electronic structure are not distributed equally over different parts of the system . in data",
    "compression the details of the picture are systematically included by consecutive refinements of the image only in those spatial regions where it is necessary .",
    "a similar approach to the electronic wave function suggests that the fine details of the distribution are concentrated around the nuclear cusps and singularities of the two - electron density matrix .",
    "it has been shown , that the surroundings of a molecule can be described at a rather rough resolution level @xcite .",
    "we have also demonstrated @xcite , that the extremely hardly representable electron - electron cusp singularity of the two - electron density operator can be easily reproduced by the method of multiresolution analysis .",
    "the applicability of these approaches strongly depends on the necessary depth of refinement .",
    "clearly , a uniform refinement of the distributions leads to an exponential increase of the computational efforts with growing resolution level .",
    "the region where the refinements are applied has to be confined , in order to achieve computationally manageable algorithms . in this contribution",
    "we study some questions concerning several aspects raised by the above considerations .",
    "we analyze the detail structure of the wave function , we explore how the spatial regions where further refinement is necessary are to be identified , and how can the extension of the eigenvalue problem to new subspaces be restricted .",
    "we trace how the projection of the wave function to different resolution level subspaces is changing in the course of the consecutive refinement steps .",
    "the performance of the adaptive refinement algorithm is tested by numerical comparisons to the exact analytical solution of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "multiresolution analysis theory ensures that an arbitrary element of the hilbert space @xmath0 can be exactly decomposed into orthogonal components as @xmath1 here , the basis functions @xmath2 are equidistant shifts of the `` mother scaling function '' @xmath3 over a coarse grid of spacing 1 . refinements to the first approximation described by the first summation in ( [ psidecomp ] ) are introduced by the @xmath4 level wavelets @xmath5 .",

    "the subspaces @xmath14 , @xmath15 constitute a complete decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath16 i.e. , expansion ( [ psidecomp ] ) is exact .",
    "we define the resolution structure of the wave function by the series of components @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are orthogonal projection operators to subspaces @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . as according to parseval s equality @xmath22",
    "we can measure the @xmath23th level complexity of the wave function by the number @xmath24 , which characterizes how important is the detail space @xmath21 in expanding @xmath25 .",
    "the decision , to include or omit @xmath21 is crucial in developing useful algorithms for the following reasons .",
    "the basis functions of @xmath21 are `` sitting '' on an equidistant grid with a grid length of @xmath26 .",
    "if a function constrained to a finite domain of the space is expanded , the number of basis functions in @xmath21 is increasing like @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dimension of the system .",
    "this exponential `` explosion '' makes the direct application of ( [ psidecomp ] ) unacceptable .",
    "detail spaces with negligible @xmath24 ( lower than a predefined threshold ) can be completely ignored .",
    "the experience @xcite of finding details in a constrained region of the space leads , however , to the conclusion , that even if @xmath29 is significant , only very few terms in the summation contribute essentially to its value .",
    "this recognition would help to avoid the exponential explosion mentioned above , by using the restricted detail space @xmath30 .",
    "the outlined strategy is , however , useless , if the choice of the significant @xmath31 would be based on a prior calculation of _ all _ coefficients , and testing how many @xmath31 are necessary to fulfill ( [ significant ] ) with a good approximation .",
    "clearly , a predictive method is needed",
    ".      we will illustrate the above consideration with a simple exactly solvable example in @xmath32 dimension .",
    "the case of @xmath33 is expected to have similar behavior with correspondingly greater numbers of basis functions .",
    "the ground state and some excited states of the standard example of the 1d harmonic oscillator with the hamiltonian @xmath34 are analyzed .",
    "one reason for choosing this system is that the matrix elements @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be calculated exactly for ( [ ho_hamiltonian ] ) , making possible to avoid inaccuracies not connected to hilbert space constraints .",
