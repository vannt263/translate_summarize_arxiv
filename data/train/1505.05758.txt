    "the dynamical systems theory describes different properties about asymptotic behavior , stability , relationships among system s elements and its properties .",
    "it is well known that the hyperbolic systems own some features and properties that provide very important information about its behavior . with the purpose of extending the notion of hyperbolicity , arise definitions and a new theory , such as partial hyperbolicity , singular hyperbolicity and sectional hyperbolicity .",
    "thus , we begin by considering the relationship between the hyperbolic and sectional hyperbolic theory .",
    "recall , the sectional hyperbolic sets and sectional anosov flows were introduced in @xcite and @xcite respectively as a generalization of the hyperbolic sets and anosov flows .",

    "a natural way is to observe the properties that are preserved or which are not in the new scenario .",
    "particularly , we mention two important properties related to hyperbolic sets which are not satisfied by all sectional hyperbolic sets .",
    "the first is the spectral decomposition theorem @xcite .",
    "it says that an attracting hyperbolic set @xmath1 is a finite disjoint union of homoclinic classes , where @xmath2 is the set of periodic points of @xmath3 .",
    "the second says that an anosov flow on a closed manifold is transitive if and only if it has dense periodic orbits .",
    "this results are false for sectional anosov flows , i.e. , sets whose maximal invariant is a sectional - hyperbolic set @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is proved that there exists a sectional anosov flow such that it is supported on a compact @xmath0-manifold , it has dense periodic orbits , is the union non disjoint of two homoclinic classes but is not transitive .",
    "so , a sectional anosov flow is said a _ venice mask _ if it has dense periodic orbits but is not transitive .",
    "the only known examples of venice masks have one or three singularities , and they are characterized by having two properties : are the union non disjoint of two homoclinic classes and the intersection of its homoclinic classes is the closure of the unstable manifold of a singularity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , we provide two examples of venice masks with two singularities , but with different features . in particular , each one is the union of two different homoclinic classes .",
