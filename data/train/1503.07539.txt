    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite provides the most widely used models for computing ground state electronic energies and densities in chemistry , materials science , biology , and nanosciences .",
    "the success of dft lies in the use of exchange - correlation functionals that model the intricate many - body interaction energy by explicit expressions in terms of the one - body density or the one - body kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "although currently available approximations , such as b3lyp @xcite or pbe @xcite , perform remarkably well for a wide range of systems , the dft models exhibit well - known failures when strong correlation effects are present , as arising for example in the breaking of chemical bonds @xcite . therefore , finding an accurate single - particle formalism that remains reliable in strongly correlated regimes remains a major challenge .",
    "+ in this paper we shed new light on this challenge by studying the exact map @xmath7 from single - particle density to _ pair density _ whose existence is assured by abstract dft .",
    "the exact interaction energy is obtained by integrating the pair density against the coulomb repulsion potential ( see below ) , so any approximation @xmath8 yields an approximate interaction energy functional .",
    "we take the view , first advocated by gunnarsson and lundqvist @xcite , that the exact density - to - pair - density map @xmath7 is a better starting point to understand or design model interaction energy functionals than the commonly used density - to - interaction - energy map @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "this is because the pair density , a function on two - body configuration space , encodes a wealth of physically and mathematially interesting information about a many - body quantum system which is `` averaged out '' in the interaction energy , a mere number . in particular , comparing exact and approximate pair densities does not just yield a total interaction energy error , but also reveals where in two - body configuration space the error is localized . +",
    "the main results in our paper are careful simulations of the exact density - to - pair - density map for typical one - dimensional model systems , with different electron numbers and different density profiles varying from `` concentrated '' to `` dilute '' .",
    "the algorithm we develop for this purpose allows one to deal with the infinite - dimensional , nonlinear constraint of fixed single - particle density which appears in the definition of the map . to obtain a simple form of this constraint after discretization",
    ", we use a finite - element basis from computational mathematics instead of the usual basis sets of quantum chemistry .",
    "we observe remarkable multi - scale patterns in the pair density which strongly depend on both the particle number and the `` width '' of the density profile .",
    "see e.g. figure [ fig - fermion - convex ] in section [ sec - fermion ] .",
    "these patterns are not accurately captured ( except in extreme regimes ) by any of the currently used dft models , but in our view constitute fundamental low - dimensional manifestations of exact dft .",
    "we thus hope that our simulations , despite the limitation to one - dimensional model densities , offer exciting glimpses of possible future dft models .",
    "+ in the remainder of this introduction we informally discuss the definition of the exact density - to - pair density map , display two instructive extreme and opposite approximations in the dft literature , and explain how our simulations seamlessly connect all three . the exact density - to - pair - density map is constructed as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the map obtained by levy - lieb constrained search @xcite , i.e. @xmath12 is the @xmath13-electron wavefunction which minimizes kinetic plus potential energy , @xmath14+v_{ee}[\\psi]$ ] , subject to the constraint that @xmath12 has single - particle density @xmath15 ( see section 2 for notation , function spaces , and further explanation ) , and the pair density associated to any @xmath13-electron wavefunction @xmath12 is @xmath16 are space - spin coordinates for the @xmath17 electron . minimizing @xmath12 s always exist @xcite , and the complication of possible non - uniqueness is discussed in section [ sec - universalmap ] .",
    "the electron - electron interaction energy is a simple explicit functional of the pair density , @xmath18=\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^6}\\frac{\\rho_2^{\\psi}(x , y)}{|x - y|}dx\\ , dy.\\ ] ] hence any approximate expression of the pair density in terms of the single - particle density gives , by substitution into , an approximate interaction energy functional .",
    "numerous functionals have been formulated in this way @xcite .",
    "standard dft models start from a _ statistical independence ansatz _ @xmath19 and include all the many - body effects in a correcting exchange - correlation energy functional .",
    "opposite to this uncorrelated ansatz , there is the more recent _ strictly correlated electrons _ ( sce ) model @xcite , which is attracting attention in the mathematics literature @xcite due to its connection with optimal transportation theory and which arises from neglecting the kinetic energy in the constrained search in .",
    "the corresponding ansatz for the pair density is @xmath20 with @xmath21 being certain optimal transport maps , see section [ sec : approx ] for more details .    the formalisms and give `` extreme '' pair densities .",
    "true pair densities , unlike , are expected to localize in certain regions due to shell structure or ionicity avoidance ; but emphasizes this localization too much and misses its quantum features .",
    "most of the practically interesting models , such as the local density approximation ( see section [ sec : approx ] ) , lie `` inbetween '' these two extreme distributions .",
    "but what kind of `` interpolation '' is the right one , and captures true pair densities ?    a marvellous tool to approach",
    "this question is _ density scaling _ , introduced in the context of exact dft by levy and perdew @xcite , which is closely related to the _ adiabatic connection _ utilized in many dft studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . alongside a given density @xmath22 ,",
    "consider  as we shall in our simulations ",
    "its re - scalings @xmath23 the parameter @xmath6 seamlessely rescales a dilute system ( @xmath3 ) into a concentrated one ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "but the associated pair densities do _ not _ just change by a rescaling , that is to say @xmath24\\neq d_\\alpha\\rho_2[\\rho]$ ] ( where @xmath25 acts on pair densities as @xmath26 ) .",
    "instead , it follows from the arguments in @xcite that the following diagram commutes : @xmath27^{{\\rm scale } }               \\ar[d]_{\\min \\ , { \\alpha } t + v_{ee } } &                           { d_{\\alpha}\\rho } \\ar[d]^{\\min \\ , t + v_{ee } } \\\\",

    "see proposition [ propo - falpha-1 ] below .",
    "thus the scaling parameter @xmath6 in acts as a coupling constant in the one - parameter family of variational problems on the left which govern the pair density .",
    "this family `` adiabatically '' , i.e. while keeping the density fixed , connects the problem of minimizing just @xmath28 ( @xmath4 ) via @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) to minimizing just @xmath31 ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "nontrivial but well known formal asymptotics for the minimizing wavefunction for @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 ( see e.g. @xcite ) together with formula then suggests the following : the true pair density is asymptotic to that of the sce state , eq .",
    ", as @xmath34 @xcite , and to that of the slater determinant of the kohn - sham orbitals as @xmath35 .",
    "the latter reduces to when @xmath36 or when the particles are bosons , and in addition contains ` exact exchange ' ( see section [ sec : approx ] ) for higher @xmath13 .",
    "see sections [ sec - hk ] , [ sec : asy ] for more details and rigorous proofs in special cases . now back to our central question :",
    "which `` interpolation '' between the extreme pair densities and is right ?",
    "our numerical results for typical families of one - dimensional densities with different particle numbers show that _ many different interpolations are right_. see , e.g. , figure [ fig - fermion - convex ] .",
    "the true pair densities form a two - parameter family which strongly depend on both the particle number @xmath13 and the scaling parameter @xmath6 . at",
    "fixed @xmath13 they steadily `` cross over '' from ( plus exact exchange when @xmath37 ) to .",
    "the impractical , highly implicit definition is able to pick out the right parameter values from the density , but _ simple explicit formulae will not_. in the very special case of homogeneous systems in one dimension ( see figure [ fig - fermion - periodic ] ) we design an ansatz which does .",
    "the idea is to simultaneously smoothen out the pair densities from the strongly interacting limit and fading out the exchange terms from the weakly interacting limit .",
    "but the correct smoothing lengthscale and the correct fraction of exchange keep changing with @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "see table [ table - appro - fermion ] .",
    "our simulations to some extent support the celebrated idea @xcite underlying the functional b3lyp to mix in a fraction of exact exchange .",
    "but they show that the right fraction , taken to be @xmath38 in b3lyp @xcite , is in fact _ not _ constant . at present",
    "we have no proposal how the right fraction could be adaptively picked out in realistic ( inhomogeneous , 3d ) simulations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in the next two sections , we recall basic aspects of dft and give the precise definition of the universal density - to - pair - density map .",
    "we then show in section [ sec : approx ] how some common dft functionals arise from approximations of this map .",
