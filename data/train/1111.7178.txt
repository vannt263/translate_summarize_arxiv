    "there are good theoretical and phenomenological reasons to consider left - right ( lr ) extensions @xcite of the mssm .",
    "besides the restoration of parity at high energies , two motivations can be especially highlighted .",
    "first , lr models contain all the ingredients to explain the observed neutrino masses and mixings thanks to the well - known seesaw mechanism @xcite . and second",
    ", the gauging of @xmath0 provides a natural framework to explain the origin of r - parity , which can be understood as the low energy remnant of the high energy gauge symmetry .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the lr model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main difference with respect to previous proposals @xcite was the presence of additional triplets with zero @xmath0 charge .",
    "the main advantage of this setup , in the following called the @xmath1lr model , is the existence of r - parity conserving minima in the tree level scalar potential .    in the @xmath1lr model",
    "@xcite new superfields appear with masses below the gut scale .",
    "furthermore , the gauge group is extended to @xmath2 at energies above the lr breaking scale .",
    "both facts significantly affect the rge running of all parameters",
    ". therefore , even though the lr breaking scale is very far from the reach of current accelerators , there are interesting effects in the phenomenology caused by the running of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and the subsequent deformation of the susy spectra with respect to the cmssm expectation @xcite .",
    "astrophysical observations and the data from wmap @xcite put on solid grounds the existence of non - baryonic dark matter in the universe .",
    "the most popular candidate is the lightest neutralino in r - parity conserving supersymmetry .",
    "however , all solutions in the cmssm parameter space @xcite require a fine - tuning @xcite among some masses in order to enhance the annihilation / co - annihilation cross - sections , decrease the lightest neutralino relic abundance , @xmath3 , and reproduce the observed dark matter relic density @xcite . therefore , it is not surprising that even small changes in the susy spectra can dramatically change the resulting @xmath3 .",
    "the description of these changes in the @xmath1lr model is the main subject of this work .",
    "in this section we present the model originally defined in @xcite . for further details see @xcite .    below the gut scale the gauge group of the model is @xmath4 . besides the particle content of the mssm with the addition of ( three ) right - handed neutrino(s ) @xmath5 , some additional superfields are introduced .",
    "first , two generations of @xmath6 superfields , bidoublets under @xmath7 , are introduced .",
    "furthermore , triplets under ( one of ) the @xmath8 gauge groups are added with gauge quantum numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    with these representations and assuming parity conservation , the most general superpotential compatible with the symmetries is @xmath15    the breaking of the lr gauge group to the mssm gauge group takes place in two steps : @xmath16 .",
    "first , the neutral component of the @xmath17 triplet takes a vev ( vacuum expectation value ) , @xmath18 , breaking @xmath19 .",
    "next , the group @xmath20 is broken by @xmath21 .",
    "neutrino masses are generated at this stage via the superpotential term @xmath22 which , after @xmath23 gets broken , leads to majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos and a type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "in general , with @xmath24 , the @xmath1lr has a lighter spectrum than the cmssm for the same parameters . since in the @xmath1lr model",
    "the running of the gauge couplings is changed with respect to the mssm case , also gaugino masses are changed .",
    "consider for example @xmath25 . at 1-loop leading - log order",
    "we find @xmath26\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two numerical factors .",
    "equation shows that one can decrease @xmath30 with respect to the cmssm value by using a large @xmath31 and @xmath32 and increase it only in the case @xmath33 .",
    "this change in @xmath30 has a strong impact on dark matter phenomenology , since the lightest neutralino is mostly bino in most parts of parameter space .",
    "we present now our results concerning dark matter phenomenology in the @xmath1lr model .",
    "we will discuss the main differences with respect to the cmssm for ( 1 ) the standard stau co - annihilation region @xcite , and ( 2 ) flavoured co - annihilation @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the parameters at the susy scale was done with spheno @xcite , using the complete 2-loop rges at all scales .",
    "these were derived with the mathematica package sarah @xcite .",
    "finally , we used micromegas @xcite to obtain the value of @xmath34      as discussed , lowering the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 leads in general to a lighter spectrum compared to the pure cmssm case . since the mass of the bino decreases faster than the mass of the stau , the quantity @xmath37 , and thus the neutralino relic abundance , gets increased for low @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this can only be compensated by reducing @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "two examples of stau co - annihilation regions are shown in figure  [ fig : dmtb10-i ] . as expected ,",
    "a shift of the allowed region towards smaller values of @xmath38 is found .",
    "morever , the region can disappear for sufficiently low @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the observation of a particle spectrum consistent with the cmssm stau co - annihilation region could thus be turned into lower limits on @xmath35 and @xmath36 .     allowed regions for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 gev ( left ) and @xmath41 gev ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   allowed regions for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 gev ( left ) and @xmath41 gev ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      as shown in @xcite , the @xmath1lr model allows for large flavour violating effects in the right slepton sector .",
    "this implies that the @xmath42 can be made ligther by flavour contributions , leading to co - annihilation with the lightest neutralino in points of parameter space where it would be impossible without flavour effects .",
    "moreover , flavour violating processes become relevant in the determination of the relic density , and they must be taken into account .",
    "this is the so - called flavoured co - annihilation mechanism @xcite .",
    "when searching for such points in parameter space one must take into account the strong limits for @xmath43 given by the meg experiment @xcite .",
    "a fine - tuning of the parameters is required in order to cancel this observable and , at the same time , reduce the @xmath44 mass sufficiently .",
    "figure  [ fig : flav - coa-1 ] shows two examples . on the left panel",
    "the cancellation of @xmath43 is obtained with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while on the right panel with @xmath47 .",
    "note that this occurs for different values of @xmath38 and @xmath48 .     and @xmath49 contour plots in the @xmath38-@xmath48 plane for @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( left ) and @xmath52 ( right ) .",
    "both examples were obtained with @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    and @xmath49 contour plots in the @xmath38-@xmath48 plane for @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( left ) and @xmath52 ( right ) . both examples",
    "were obtained with @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have studied the dark matter phenomenology of the @xmath1lr model , a supersymmetric left - right model that breaks the lr symmetry at high energies .",
    "the change in the running of the parameters at energies above the breaking scale has a strong impact on the low energy spectra , modifying the usual dark matter predictions of the cmssm .    the shift of the stau co - annihilation region and its potential disappearance has been studied .",
    "the fact that the lightest neutralino is usually lighter in the @xmath1lr model than in the cmssm reduces the allowed stau co - annihilation region , which can even vanish for low @xmath36 and/or @xmath35 .",
    "the model also allows for flavoured co - annihilation .",
    "examples have been given of points in parameter space where the @xmath44 mass is reduced by means of flavour effects , leading to the observed dark matter relic abundance .",
