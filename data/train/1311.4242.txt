    "the concept of space solar power ( ssp ) bases on conversion of solar energy into electricity on orbit and transmission of the collected energy to earth through wireless power transmission .",
    "the concept was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and continuously attracted interest from researchers and government agencies .",
    "several system - level studies established technological feasibility of ssp ( e.g. , the @xmath0 iaa study , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and potential economic viability ( e.g. , ref .",
    "multiple subsystem technology verifications and demonstrations have been carried out ( for an overview see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) , and first prototype integration studies including space environment simulation were performed at the naval research laboratory , usa  @xcite .",
    "space solar power represents a candidate large - scale renewable energy source in the context of rising global energy demand , which is expected to increase by @xmath1 until @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "compared to energy production from non - renewable energies , e.g. fossil fuels , electricity from ssp causes lower emissions of greenhouse gases which are connected to man - made climate change  @xcite .",
    "this paper in parts bases on research work reported in an entry to the @xmath3 space solar power international student and young professional design competition of the space generation advisory council / international astronautical federation which was selected as the winning contribution and which will be published in the international astronautical congress @xmath4 proceedings  @xcite . while the eventual ssp constellation architecture is entirely different , similarities between ref .",
    "@xcite and the design presented in this paper will be explicitly pointed out .",
    "the goal of this paper is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite : to contribute to enabling mid - term ssp deployment . to achieve this ,",
    "the latest experimental ssp system integration results are combined with aspects of previous ssp system architecture work to formulate a scalable ssp design , under special attention to independence of in - space assembly and transportation infrastructure .",
    "the design avoids such auxiliary systems since their development is likely to delay or even prevent realization of utility - scale ssp as a whole due to the larger amount of required resources to achieve first power .",
    "the ssp design presented in this paper similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite also bases heavily on hypermodularity to reduce total system cost through mass production and increase system reliability due to fewer points of failure ( as recently shown in e.g. ref .",
    "thus the design is named hypermodular self - assembling space solar power ( hsa - ssp ) .",
    "another feature of ssp designs first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is the limitation of ssp satellite size to the capacities of near - term launch vehicles , such as spacex falcon heavy launcher  @xcite , to ensure realistic self - assembly .",
    "this requirement allows insect - like formation of large structures or constellations by identical , but yet independently fully functional sps , similar but different to the ideas presented in ref .",
    "in addition , the concept of such fragmentation of large structures into fully functional units enables the begin of power production already after the delivery of a certain smaller threshold amount of units , which allows revenue income from early on in the deployment time frame and shortens the time to amortization of invested cost .",
    "similarly to the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the design of hsa - ssp utilizes photovoltaic cells for electricity generation and microwave power transmission at @xmath5  ghz using solid state power amplifiers for simplicity .",
    "along the descriptions in ref .",
    "@xcite , each hsa - sps consists of a main planar platform composed of several hexagonally - shaped sandwich structures where the power generation and power transmission surfaces are located close to each other in a parallel , sandwich - like layering , similar in design to the hexbus sandwich structures proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the main platform also contains all other systems necessary to operate the satellite in space , such as thermal management systems , guidance , navigation and control , command and data systems , and communication systems .",
    "the hsa - sps power transmission surface of the sandwich modules is pointed towards earth at all times . in order to achieve continuous illumination of the power generating surface throughout the entire orbit , each hsa - sps platform",
    "is associated with a free - flying associated reflector or concentrator structure .",
    "the reflector structure is of sufficient size to allow three - sun concentration on the photovoltaic sandwich surface and can consist of individually controlled movable reflector elements , but will otherwise not be specified in more detail in this paper .",
    "the reflectors are not structurally connected to the sandwich platform to reduce self - assembly complexity and both launch mass and volume .",
    "similarly to the design described in ref .",
    "@xcite , mid - term technology advancement is expected to improve current sandwich performance parameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite by about @xmath6 .",
    "this yields an area - specific mass of about @xmath7  kg / m@xmath8 including all power transmission electronic elements , an effective sandwich height , including protective packaging , of about @xmath9  cm , and a sunlight - to - rf sandwich module efficiency of about @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the thermal properties of mid - term hsa - sps are expected to allow three - sun concentration on the photovoltaic surface of the sandwich modules .    as described above",
    ", the size of a complete hsa - sps system is limited to the payload volume and payload mass of the spacex falcon heavy vehicle .",
    "similar to the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , about @xmath11 are subtracted from the total payload volume of about @xmath12  m@xmath13 for protective packaging against shock and vibration during launch . in the present study , however , sandwich modules are more stringently limited to occupy @xmath14 of the remaining volume or about @xmath15  m@xmath13 , to leave sufficient volume ( about @xmath16  m@xmath13 ) for the reflector array and all other hsa - sps subsystems .",
    "this is assumed to improve the realistic value of the hsa - sps design .",
    "figure  [ fig : payloadintegration ] shows a sketch of the payload integration of a complete hsa - sps in the payload fairing of a falcon heavy vehicle .     illustrating payload integration scheme of a complete hsa - sps in a falcon heavy vehicle.,scaledwidth=40.0%",
    "]    considering the expected mid - term effective sandwich module height of about @xmath9  cm , about @xmath17 hexagonal sandwich modules with base areas of about @xmath18  m@xmath19 stacked along the vertical axis of the falcon heavy payload volume fulfill the volume constraints . assuming that @xmath20 of the total , about @xmath21  m@xmath19 power generating surface area of the sandwich modules are used to generate electricity at @xmath22-sun concentration with an incident energy density of about @xmath23  w / m@xmath19 , a single falcon heavy can launch a hsa - sps with a nameplate rf power generation capacity of about @xmath24  kw .    similarly to the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sandwich platform of each hsa - sps will self - assemble on orbit through e.g. spring - loaded interconnects between sandwich modules or other low - complexity technology options . as an illustration , table  [ tab : midtermcomp ] compares the specifications of sandwich platforms performing at current sandwich integration results with sandwich platforms performing along assumed mid - term technology advances .",
    ".comparison between sandwich platforms consisting of sandwiches with currently achieved module parameters and expected mid - term improvements of sandwich parameters for utility - scale mid - term hsa - sps .",
    "resulting nameplate rf power levels for complete hsa - sps from single falcon heavy launches are given as well .",
    "current sandwich performance parameters are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in a similar reasoning as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the estimated development , production and launch cost of a @xmath25  gw rf power hsa - sps constellation would amortize within about @xmath18 years , if the rectenna could be located in new england and power could be sold to utility companies for @xmath26  cents / kwh , so cheaper than the average retail price for all end - use sectors  @xcite . again , earlier break - even could be reached if power is being sold already before all hsa - sps are delivered to glpo .",
    "the main design advantages of hsa - sss are shared with the design proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : independence of costly and yet - to - be developed in - space assembly and orbital transfer infrastructure ; sale of utility - scale power to utility companies within probably less than @xmath27 years of production start ( assuming @xmath28 falcon heavy launches per year ) ; reduction of development time due to limited size of complete hsa - sps systems . also , damaged hsa - sps can be removed from the constellation , repaired in a repair orbit and then re - inserted into the constellation , while new hsa - sps can be added to the constellation at any time via falcon heavy launches .",
    "critically , the hsa - sps design at the present level of study does not pose inherent , with current or mid - term technology insurmountable orbital dynamic or rf beam forming difficulties , in contrast to the design shown in ref .",
    "the hsa - sps design is fairly straight forward in terms of only consisting of two large - scale elements on the architecture level , which are the sandwich platform and the reflector array .",
    "distance between these two elements can be chosen such that the difference in orbital velocity and period can be remedied via electric thrusters with a moderate propellant requirement .",
    "placement of the elements in glpo should largely reduce the two necessary station - keeping efforts for pointing the rf transmission surfaces at earth at all times and directing concentrated sunlight on the photovoltaic surfaces from the reflector arrays .",
    "additional orbital dynamic studies should be performed to verify the validity and low technological complexity of the design , and that system lifetimes of the order of @xmath29  years are realistic .",
    "thermal performance of hsa - sps can be further enhanced , as mentioned above , by introducing gaps between adjacent single hsa - sps and utilizing the gaps for radiator material to decrease the operating temperature of the sandwich module .",
    "in addition , similar to the design shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , hsa - sps are sufficiently small such that any sandwich module is fairly close to potential radiators on the outsides of the sps .",
    "this would enable fairly efficient transport of excess heat from any sandwich module via heat pipes to the outside radiators , which could allow higher concentration factors on the pv modules .",
    "another possible opportunity for the hsa - sps design is that electrical power could be shared among neighboring sandwich modules or among modules in the entire hsa - sps .",
    "in order to optimize economics of sps launch , it is generally accepted that area - specific mass should be decreased and efficiency increased . however , in the context of pre - fabricated and self - deploying sps designs , sandwich volume , or effective module height for a given base surface area , is identified as a critical parameter . to most",
    "economically use e.g. the spacex falcon heavy vehicle capacities , an average effective payload density of about @xmath30  tons / m@xmath13 has to be achieved , if ssp remains the only large - scale buyer on the launch market . for an assumed mid - term @xmath27",
    "kg / m@xmath8 area - specific mass of sandwich modules , a corresponding effective module height of about @xmath31  cm is necessary to attain the optimal module mass density , and thus to maximize the number of modules transported per launch . considering that the mass of about @xmath32 sandwich modules with parameters given in table  [ tab : midtermcomp ] could be launched by a single falcon heavy vehicle , but the volume of only @xmath17 modules , module height can be regarded as a more limiting aspect in sandwich payload integration than area - specific mass at this time .",
    "if in - space assembly infrastructure is not developed in the next decades , dedicated r@xmath33d effort should be focused in the near - term on reducing the effective height of sps sandwich modules , e.g. to less than @xmath34  cm .",
    "this could reduce sps launch costs by a factor @xmath35 or more .",
    "a possible solution to this problem could be attempting to integrate pmad and rf power electronics into a heat - distributing substrate attached to high - efficiency thin - film pv , combined with thin rf antennas .",
    "planarity could be supported by , e.g. , an aluminum mesh .",
    "the thermal properties of such a system remain to be investigated .",
    "an update of the ssp design presented in ref .",
    "@xcite results in the formulation of a new ssp concept , hsa - ssp .",
    "the design is scalable to utility - scale power and does not rely on in - space assembly or transportation infrastructure .",
    "extrapolations of current technology suggests a realistic design for mid - term sps deployment . a cost estimation analysis for a @xmath25  gw",
    "rf power hsa - sps constellation yields a total cost of about @xmath36  b  usd , utilizing a learning curve approach similar to the one described in ref .",
    "the advantages of the presented design will be solidified and extended in further research .",
