    ", this expression takes the form @xmath13 the right - hand side of ( [ energy1a ] ) involves only those combinations of the elasticity tensor components which are symmetric under permutation of the first and the last pairs of indices .",
    "consequently , the so - called _ major symmetry _ , @xmath14 is assumed . in 3-dimensional space , a fourth rank tensor with the symmetries ( [ s1-sym ] ) and ( [ paircom ] ) has 21 independent components .    in the literature on elasticity ,",
    "a special decomposition of @xmath15 into two tensorial parts is frequently used , see , for example , cowin @xcite , campanella & tonton @xcite , podio - guidugli @xcite , weiner @xcite , and hausshl @xcite .",

    "]    it is straightforward to show @xcite that @xmath17 and @xmath18 fulfill the major symmetry ( [ s1-sym ] ) but _ not _ the minor symmetries ( [ paircom ] ) . moreover , the tensor @xmath17 can be further decomposed .",
    "accordingly , the reducible decomposition in ( [ mndef])@xmath19 does not correspond to a direct sum decomposition of the vector space defined by @xmath0 .",
    "the vector spaces of @xmath17 and @xmath0 both turn out to be 21-dimensional , that of @xmath18 is 6-dimensional .",
    "thus , the tensors @xmath17 and @xmath18 are auxiliary quantities but , due to the lack of the minor symmetries , they they do _ not _ represent elasticity tensors , that is , they can not be used to characterize a certain material elastically .",
    "these quantities are placeholders without direct physical interpretation . however , in the elasticity literature some physical interpretations of the tensors @xmath17 and @xmath18 are offered . still , these results are inconsistent as we showed earlier in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present various decompositions of the elasticity tensor based on group - theoretic arguments and discuss some physical applications of these decompositions .    the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec.2 we discuss the relation between the decomposition of a tensor and the group of transformations acted on the basic vector space .",
    "sec.3 is devoted to the @xmath20 decomposition of the elasticity tensor .",
    "it is based on the young diagram technique .",
    "similarly , in sec.4 we treat the case of the @xmath21 and in sec.5 that of the @xmath22 . in sec.6",
    "we delineate some physical applications of the irreducible decomposition described .",
    "in a precise algebraic treatment , a tensor must be viewed as a linear map from a vector space to the field of real numbers , rather than as a collection of real valued components .",
    "a tensor of rank @xmath23 is defined as a multi - linear map from the cartesian product of @xmath23 copies of @xmath24 into the field @xmath25 , @xmath26 the set of all tensors @xmath27 of the rank @xmath23 compose a vector space by itself , say @xmath28 . the dimension of this _ tensor space _ is equal to @xmath29 , that is , a 4th rank tensor in 3 dimensions ( 3d ) provides for @xmath28 @xmath30 dimensions . as a basis in @xmath28 , we can take the tensor products of the basis elements of @xmath24 , @xmath31 accordingly , an arbitrary contravariant tensor of rank @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath32 thus , the properties of the tensor @xmath27 in ( [ tensor - ex ] ) , in particular its proper decomposition , is related to the group of general linear transformations @xmath20 acting on the basis of @xmath24 .",
    "this group encompasses all non - singular @xmath33 matrices .",
    "the vector space @xmath24 has a basis @xmath34 and a dual cobasis @xmath35 . under the @xmath20 , the cobasis transforms as @xmath36 .",
    "we can attribute a volume element to this cobasis , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita permutation symbol , which is @xmath39 for even or odd permutations of @xmath40 , respectively , and is @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "the primed volume element @xmath42 for the transformed cobasis @xmath43 is defined analogously .",
    "if we substitute @xmath36 , we find @xmath44 since @xmath45 is numerically invariant under linear basis transformations , the volume element transforms as a scalar _ density , _ @xmath46    if we require that @xmath47 , then the volume element is an invariant ( or scalar ) and the @xmath20 reduces to the special linear group @xmath21 .    furthermore , we know from elasticity theory that the description of a deformation is based on the concept of the _ distance _ within a continuum .",
    "a deformation is meant to be the _ change _ of the distances between nearby points .",
    "however , the ( euclidean ) distance @xmath48 as such , with @xmath49 , is , by definition , invariant under the euclidean group @xmath50 , the semidirect product of the translations @xmath51 with the rotations @xmath22 . accordingly , at one point in a continuum , the special orthogonal group @xmath22 is the one relevant for the representations of the tensors in elasticity theory .",
    "the @xmath22 corresponds to all orthogonal matrices ( reciprocal equals to the transpose ) with determinant @xmath52 .",
    "if we allow also parity transformations , we arrive at the @xmath53 , the orthogonal group , and , if we drop the orthogonality requirement , eventually at the @xmath20 .",
    "alternatively , we can keep parity invariance in the first step and then arrive at the @xmath20 via the special linear group @xmath21 , which has determinant @xmath52 : @xmath54    incidentally , between the set of subgroups of @xmath20 we will use only those that do not preserve any spatial direction . for physical problems that involve some special direction , elastic material in exterior magnetic field , for instance , smaller subgroups such as @xmath55 are also relevant .",
    "the process of going down from the @xmath20 to the @xmath22 is described in detail in schouten @xcite , chap.iii . on the level of the @xmath53",
    ", we can define a _",
    "scalar _ volume element according to @xmath56 .",
    "the transformations of the @xmath53 are volume preserving .",
    "the @xmath57 is a _",
    "pre_metric concept , whereas the @xmath58 requires the existence of a metric @xmath59 .",
    "we can collect there results in a table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ table 1 . _",
    "the different groups involved in the irreducible decomposition of the elasticity tensor .    although the group @xmath22 is highly relevant in elasticity theory , it is convenient to provide the decomposition of the elasticity tensor relative to the bigger groups and to arrive at the @xmath22 only at the last stage . in this case , we are able to identify the different origins of the irreducible parts and to derive the stratified hierarchy of the invariants .",
    "such a method is also useful from the technical point of view because we need to use different algebraic methods for different groups of transformations .",
    "we begin with the decomposition relative to the biggest group @xmath20 .",
    "let us recall some basic facts about 4th rank tensors and their young decomposition :    * covariant tensor of 4th rank over the vector space @xmath24 ( with @xmath60 ) is a linear map from the cartesian product of @xmath61 copies of the dual space @xmath62 into the real numbers , @xmath63 * the set of the 4th rank tensors constitutes a new vector space @xmath64 called a 4th rank tensor space .",
    "its dimension is equal to @xmath30 .",
    "* the tensor space @xmath64 can be decomposed into the direct sum of its subspaces that are invariant under the action of the group @xmath65 . * due to the well - known schur - weyl duality , the irreducible decomposition of the space of the @xmath23th rank tensors under @xmath65 corresponds to the irreducible decomposition of the permutation group @xmath66 . *",
    "a known practical way to derive the irreducible decomposition of @xmath66 is by use of young diagrams . * a generic 4th rank tensor over the @xmath67d tensor space",
    "can be decomposed into a direct sum of four subspaces .",
    "this decomposition is depicted by the young diagrams , see @xcite or @xcite , @xmath68 the left - hand side describes a generic 4th rank tensor . on the right - hand side ,",
    "the diagrams represent the 4 subspaces . *",
    "the diagrams in ( [ irr3 ] ) come with a weight factor @xmath69 , called the dimension of the irreducible representation @xmath70 of the permutation group @xmath71 . for a diagram of the shape @xmath70 , the @xmath69-factor is calculated by the use of the hook - length formula , @xmath72 thus , for the diagrams depicted in ( [ irr3 ] ) , @xmath73 * the dimensions of the irreducible decomposition of @xmath74 are calculated by the stanley hook - content formula @xmath75 consequently , for the diagrams depicted in ( [ irr3 ] ) and for the dimension @xmath76 of the vector space",
    ", we have @xmath77 * every diagram represents a subspace of the tensor space @xmath64 , @xmath78 these subspaces intersect only at zero .",
    "moreover , they all are mutually non - isomorphic .",
    "hence we have a direct sum decomposition of the tensor space .",
    "the dimension of the initial tensor space is separated into the dimension of the subspaces as follows : @xmath79 the dimension of the tensor space is distributed between the subspaces according to @xmath80 * the decomposition ( [ hook5a ] ) is unique but reducible . in accordance with ( [ hook1 ] ) ,",
    "the subspaces @xmath81 , and @xmath82 can be decomposed still further into sub - subspaces : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 these decompositions are irreducible but not unique .",
    "the elasticity tensor is not a general 4th rank tensor ; rather , it carries its minor and major symmetries .",
    "accordingly , we are looking for a a decomposition of an invariant subspace of the tensor space @xmath86 into a direct sum of its sub - subspaces , @xmath87 where @xmath88 using the minor and major symmetries , we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath91 , we find as a unique solution of ( [ hook6x ] ) , @xmath92 thus , we proved    _ proposition 1 : _ the decomposition @xmath93 with @xmath94 is irreducible and unique .",
    "_ proposition 2 : _ the partial tensors satisfy the minor symmetries , @xmath95kl}=s^{ij[kl]}=0\\qquad { \\rm and}\\qquad   a^{[ij]kl}=a^{ij[kl]}=0\\,,\\ ] ] and the major symmetry , @xmath96    _ proposition 3 : _ the irreducible decomposition of @xmath0 signifies the reduction of the tensor space @xmath97 into a direct sum of two subspaces @xmath98 ( for the tensor @xmath1 ) and @xmath99 ( for the tensor @xmath2 ) , @xmath100 in particular , we have @xmath101    _ proposition 4 : _ the irreducible piece @xmath102 of the elasticity tensor is a fourth rank tensor .",
    "alternatively , it can be represented as a symmetric second rank tensor density @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the levi - civita permutation symbol .",
    "the proof of this proposition is given in the next section .",
    "since the elasticity tensor @xmath15 satisfies the symmetries ( [ s1-sym ] ) and ( [ paircom ] ) , most of its contractions with @xmath38 vanish .",
    "indeed , for the completely symmetric part the contraction in two indices is identically zero , @xmath105    the second part of the elasticity tensor yields a non - vanishing contraction , @xmath106 this tensor @xmath107 has vanishing traces and is antisymmetric in the upper indices , @xmath108 thus , @xmath107 has 6 independent components , exactly like the initial tensor @xmath102 .",
    "because of the antisymmetry of @xmath107 , we do not loose anything if we contract the upper indices with @xmath109 : @xmath110 we can check that this tensor is symmetric @xmath111}=0\\,.\\ ] ] thus , it has the same 6 independent components .",
    "this proves the proposition 4 .    summing up",
    ": there are no additional @xmath21 invariants of the elasticity tensor , and this tensor can not be decomposed further under the action of the @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , we derived a representation of @xmath102 in terms of @xmath112 . under the action of the special linear group @xmath21 ,",
    "the latter quantity is an ordinary tensor .",
    "since for the elasticity tensor the invariance of the volume element does not yield additional tensor decompositions , we skip the group @xmath53 and pass directly to its subgroup @xmath22 . consider a vector space @xmath113 endowed with a metric tensor @xmath114 .",
    "the norm and the scalar product of vectors are defined now in the conventional way by @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in order to preserve the scalar product ,",
    "we must restrict ourselves to the orthogonal group @xmath53 .",
    "invariance of the volume element @xmath58 is guaranteed if we restrict ourselves to the group @xmath22 .",
    "now we can use the metric tensor @xmath114 and its inverse @xmath117 .    from the contraction of the metric with the totally symmetric cauchy part @xmath118 ,",
    "a unique symmetric second rank tensor and its scalar contraction can be constructed , @xmath119 define the traceless part of the tensor @xmath120 as @xmath121 now we turn to the decomposition of the tensor @xmath118 .",
    "we define the subtensors @xmath122 we denote the remaining part as @xmath123 now we require the tensor @xmath124 to be traceless .",
    "this yields , @xmath125 hence we obtain the unique irreducible decomposition of the tensor @xmath118 into three pieces , @xmath126 these pieces are invariant under the action of the group @xmath22 .    in order to decompose the non - cauchy part @xmath102 , it is convenient to use its representation by the tensor density @xmath127 .",
    "the latter is irreducibly decomposed to a scalar and traceless parts .",
    "@xmath128 consequently , we obtain the decomposition of @xmath102 into two independent parts @xmath129 where    the scalar and the traceless parts are given by @xmath130 respectively .",
    "this way we derived a composition of the elasticity tensor into five irreducible parts @xmath131 between the first parentheses we collected the terms corresponding to the cauchy part , the second parentheses enclose the non - cauchy terms .",
    "the dimension of the tensor space of the elasticity tensor is decomposed into the sum of the corresponding dimensions of the subspaces , @xmath132 thus , @xmath133 can be represented by one totally traceless and totally symmetric 4th rank tensor @xmath134 _ plus _ two symmetric traceless 2nd rank tensors @xmath135 _ plus _ two scalars @xmath136 .",
    "this decomposition is unique and irreducible under the action of the @xmath137 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the same decomposition was derived backus @xcite ( see also baerheim @xcite ) in a rather different way . in our group - theoretical treatment , we obtained all irreducible pieces in a covariant form .",
    "moreover , we derived a tree of the independent invariances and their relations to different transformation groups .",
    "we describe this stratified structure in the following diagram :        _ figure 1 . _ the decomposition tree of the elasticity tensor @xmath138 .",
    "note that @xmath127 is a tensor ( and _ not _ a density ) under the @xmath21 .",
    "some non - trivial applications were recently discussed by us in @xcite ( for the analogous case in electrodynamics , see @xcite ) :      the cauchy relations are given by @xmath139 for their history , see todhunter @xcite .",
    "the representation in ( [ cauchy1a ] ) is widely used in the elasticity literature , see , for example , @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we presented an alternative form of these conditions , namely @xmath140 the last equation can be presented in a more economical form , @xmath141 the basic difference between ( [ cauchy1a ] ) on the one hand and ( [ second ] ) or ( [ second-1 ] ) at the other hand is that our conditions ( [ second ] ) or ( [ second-1 ] ) are represented in an irreducible form .",
    "this can have decisive consequences .    for most materials the cauchy relations do not hold , even approximately . in fact",
    ", the elasticity of a generic anisotropic material is described by the whole set of the 21 independent components , it is not restricted to the set of 15 independent components obeying the cauchy relations .",
    "this fact seems to nullify the importance of the cauchy relations for modern solid state theory and leave them only as historical artifact .",
    "however , a lattice - theoretical approach to the elastic constants shows , see leibfried @xcite , that the cauchy relations are valid provided ( i ) the interaction forces between the atoms or molecules of a crystal are central forces , as , for instance , in rock salt , ( ii ) each atom or molecule is a center of symmetry , and ( iii ) the interaction forces between the building blocks of a crystal can be well approximated by a harmonic potential , see perrin @xcite . accordingly , a study of the _ violations _ of the cauchy relations yields important information about the intermolecular forces of elastic bodies .",
    "accordingly , one should look for the _ deviation _ @xmath102 of the elasticity tensor @xmath15 from its cauchy part @xmath118 .      if @xmath142 is the displacement field , the propagation of acoustic waves in anisotropic media is determined by the following equation ( @xmath143 = mass density ) : @xmath144 with a plane wave ansatz @xmath145 , we obtain a system of three homogeneous algebraic equations @xmath146 where the _ christoffel tensor _ @xmath147 and of the _ phase velocity _",
    "@xmath148 are used . substituting the irreducible @xmath149-decomposition into the christoffel tensor",
    ", we obtain @xmath150 where the cauchy and non - cauchy christoffel tensors are defined by @xmath151    acoustic wave propagation in an elastic medium is an eigenvector problem , see ( [ char1 ] ) , with the phase velocity @xmath152 as the eigenvalues . in general",
    ", three distinct real positive solutions correspond to three independent waves @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , called _ acoustic polarizations .",
    "_ for isotropic materials , there are three pure polarizations : one _ longitudinal ( or compression ) wave _      in general , for anisotropic materials , three pure modes do not exist .",
    "the identification of the pure modes and the condition for their existence is an interesting problem .",
    "let us show how the irreducible decomposition of the elasticity tensor , which we applied to the christoffel tensor , can be used here .",
    "_ proposition 5 : _ let @xmath158 denote an allowed direction for the propagation of a _ compression _ wave",
    ". then the velocity @xmath159 of this wave in the direction of @xmath158 is determined only by the _",
    "cauchy _ part of the elasticity tensor : @xmath160 moreover , for a medium with a given elasticity tensor , all three _ purely polarized _ waves ( one longitudinal and two transverse ) can propagate in the direction @xmath161 if and only if @xmath162 accordingly , for a given medium , the directions of the purely polarized waves depend on the cauchy part of the elasticity tensor _",
    "alone_. in other words , two materials , with the same cauchy parts @xmath118 of the elasticity tensor but different non - cauchy parts @xmath102 , have the same pure wave propagation directions and the same longitudinal velocity .",
