    "the microcanonical ensemble is considered to be the fundamental ensemble of statistical physics .",
    "for example , the use of the canonical gibbs ensemble is usually justified by showing that its expectation values coincide with the microcanonical ones in the infinite - volume limit . however , since an application of the microcanonical ensemble requires detailed knowledge about the energy levels of the system , it is seldom possible to use it in practice . the canonical ensemble , on the other hand , has a well - behaved path - integral expression easily extended to the gauge field theories ",
    "therefore it has become the standard ensemble of quantum statistics .",
    "nevertheless , there are situations where the easiest alternative does not work . for instance , direct applications of the grand canonical ensemble have not been able to reproduce all the results of the relativistic ion collision experiments.@xmath0 there are two possible explanations for this shortcoming of the canonical ensemble : either the particle gas created in the collision does not reach thermal equilibrium before exploding into the final state hadrons , or the system is too small to be handled by the canonical methods .",
    "recent calculations@xmath1 using the grand canonical ensemble with finite - volume corrections have , however , succeeded in describing most of the particle abundances in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this suggests that at least the final state hadron gas will thermalize , but it also shows that the finite - volume effects are prominent in these systems .",
    "these results point into the direction that the microcanonical ensemble  which is optimal for describing isolated ergodic systems with small quantum numbers  should be used for getting quantitative information about the properties of the quark - gluon plasma possibly created in the relativistic hadron collisions .",
    "the continuum path integral formulation of the microcanonical ensemble and the corresponding perturbation theory have already been developed both for scalar@xmath2 and gauge field theories,@xmath3 but since the phenomena involving hadrons happen in the low energy , strong coupling regime , non - perturbative methods are also needed .",
    "however , no general numerical treatment is presently available to compute microcanonical expectation values without _ a priori _ knowledge about the energy spectrum even in the quantum mechanical context , let alone in a quantum field theory . in this paper",
    ", we aim at a development of such a method in the spirit of lattice field theories for a class of quantum mechanical hamiltonians .",
    "the generalization of these results to the more interesting case of gauge field theories , such as quantum chromodynamics , is a subject of further work .",
    "the paper is divided into three parts : the first section introduces a new statistical ensemble , called a gaussian ensemble , and establishes its close connection to the microcanonical one . in the second section we will derive lattice integral kernels for a numerical evaluation of the gaussian expectation values . due to the complicated nature of these kernels , it is not immediately evident how monte carlo methods can be used in this computation  this will be the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "consider the operator defined by @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian .",
    "this operator is clearly bounded , self - adjoint and positive .",
    "let us assume that the spectrum of the hamiltonian is discrete with eigenvalues @xmath7 , each of which has a finite number of eigenvectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath7 . with rather loose assumptions on the eigenvalues ( @xmath11 for some @xmath12 will suffice if the multiplicities @xmath10 diverge at most polynomially in @xmath13 ) @xmath14 is trace - class and therefore defines a sensible statistical ensemble via @xmath15 note that if the gibbs ensemble is well - defined for temperature @xmath16 , i.e.  @xmath17 , then @xmath18 only for finitely many @xmath19 and , since for the rest @xmath20 , @xmath21 is then trace - class .",
    "this means that the gaussian ensemble is well - defined for all systems for which we can use the canonical one .",
    "intuitively , the above density operator describes a system that was initially prepared into a gaussian energy distribution @xmath22 , but which has then stabilized under ergodic evolution in isolation .",
    "this , with the formal relation @xmath23 , will give the physical motivation for using this ensemble to approximate the microcanonical one .",
    "however , it can also be argued that the gaussian ensemble is even better suited for describing real experimental situations than the microcanonical ensemble , since it naturally incorporates the energy resolution of the experiment through the parameter @xmath24in any real experiment the total energy of the system ( e.g.  of a particle ) can not be known exactly , but only within a certain accuracy .",
    "we will now turn to the mathematical justification of these formal statements .    using the earlier notations",
    ", we can express the trace in ( [ e : defev ] ) as @xmath25 \\langle\\omega_{n , k}|\\widehat{a}|\\omega_{n , k}\\rangle.\\ ] ] since @xmath26 =   0\\mbox { , when } e\\ne e_n,\\ ] ] the partition function clearly satisfies @xmath27    in the evaluation of the limit of the expectation values , we need the result @xmath28 }    \\longrightarrow \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }     0\\mbox { , if } |e_{n ' } -e| < |e_n -e|\\mbox { for some } n ' \\\\     ( \\sum_{n ' } \\kappa_{n'}\\delta_{|e_{n ' } -e|,|e_n -e|})^{-1}\\mbox { , otherwise }    \\end{array}\\right . .\\ ] ] in other words , this limit is zero if @xmath7 is not the eigenvalue nearest to @xmath29 , it is @xmath30 if both @xmath7 and @xmath31 are nearest eigenvalues ( i.e.  if @xmath29 lies exactly in the middle of the segment joining @xmath7 and @xmath31 and no other eigenvalues are on this segment ) and it is @xmath32 if @xmath7 is a unique nearest eigenvalue .",
    "let us use notation @xmath33 for the sum @xmath34 .    using the formula ( [ e : tracesum ] ) for the traces and ( [ e : elim ] ) to compute the limit , we arrive at @xmath35   \\over   { { \\rm",

    "since @xmath37 is the number of terms in the last sum , the last expression is nothing but the average of the expectation values of @xmath38 over the energy eigenstates nearest to @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath29 coincides with a point in the spectrum , the limit @xmath39 will give the microcanonical expectation value .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath29 does not belong to the energy spectrum ( in which case the microcanonical ensemble is in principle ill - defined ) , then the microcanonical result corresponding to the nearest eigenvalue is obtained .",
    "the only values of @xmath29 giving non - microcanonical limits are those lying exactly in the middle between two eigenvalues , but even then the result is an expectation value of a uniform distribution over two energy eigenvalues .    in the above , we tacitly assumed that it is possible to exchange the order of the limit and the sum over @xmath13 .",
    "this operation is in fact allowed if the sum in ( [ e : tracesum ] ) converges absolutely for any @xmath40 , which for positive @xmath38 is tantamount to the assumption @xmath41",
    ". we will now prove this by showing that if ( [ e : tracesum ] ) converges absolutely for @xmath42 , then the series in ( [ e : meanlim ] ) converges uniformly for @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath36 be , as before , the index of one of the eigenvalues nearest to @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath44 is an increasing function of @xmath40 for @xmath45 , we immediately see that @xmath46 }   < \\exp\\!\\left [ { -{(e_{n } -e)^2 - ( e_{n_0 } -e)^2 \\over 2        \\varepsilon_0 ^ 2}}\\right]\\ ] ] for all @xmath13 such that @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , this inequality extends also to the case @xmath48 , since the ratio on the left hand side is always less than one .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of each of the terms of the series in ( [ e : meanlim ] ) is less than @xmath49   \\exp[{-(e_n -e)^2 / ( 2 \\varepsilon_0 ^ 2 ) } ]    |\\langle\\omega_{n , k}| \\widehat{a } |\\omega_{n , k}\\rangle|$ ] , which again form an @xmath40-independent sum that is convergent by assumption .",
    "thus the series in ( [ e : meanlim ] ) satisfies the weierstrass @xmath50-test and is uniformly convergent .    the uniform convergence of @xmath51 is similarly established by the weierstrass @xmath50-test using the monotonicity of @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "in this section we will derive a `` lattice approximation '' of the gaussian ensemble for quantum mechanical hamiltonians of the type @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a suitable potential function .",
    "for example , if @xmath54 were a ( non - constant ) polynomial bounded from below , then @xmath6 would be essentially self - adjoint and the operator @xmath55 would be trace - class with the usual feynman - kac path - integral kernel .",

    "we will need the analytic continuation of this result to the region @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath54 is a second - order polynomial , i.e.if we consider a harmonic oscillator , then this continuation can be computed exactly and it is seen to be given by ( [ e : gbtrace ] ) .",
    "there is no apparent reason why the same continuation should not work for any polynomial , but we have not yet been able to construct a proof of this generality.@xmath62 we will therefore simply assume that @xmath54 is a potential such that ( [ e : gbtrace ] ) holds for all @xmath61",
    ".    it will be useful to define a few auxilary quantities for the computation of the lattice expectation values .",
    "firstly , the relevant energy parameter of the lattice gaussian distribution will turn out to be @xmath63 and we will use a separate notation @xmath64 for this dimensionless quantity . secondly , we will need the following three `` action - like '' quantities : @xmath65 and , finally , @xmath66 . a comparision with ( [ e : gbtrace ] )",
    "reveals that @xmath67 is nothing but the usual finite - temperature lattice action for temperature @xmath68 .    in order to keep track of all the mathematical details in the derivation of the lattice ensemble , we need to use a temporary regulator to provide for absolute convergence of the integrals . in the following",
    "we have used @xmath69 for this purpose  the potentials have been chosen so that this is legitimate .",
    "since the energy spectrum is bounded from below , we can use this lower bound to give a majorant in the m - test and hence to justify the formula @xmath70 \\langle\\omega_{n , k}| \\widehat{a}|\\omega_{n , k}\\rangle,\\ ] ] for @xmath71 as before .",
    "the fourier transform of a gaussian distribution will now give the integral representation @xmath72 which , by using the bound @xmath73 < \\infty$ ] in the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem , will lead to the result @xmath74.\\ ] ]    the trace in the integrand of ( [ e : lbegin ] ) has now a path - integral expression given by ( [ e : gbtrace ] ) .",

    "but since the series in ( [ e : betastart ] ) clearly converges uniformly in @xmath29 and thus gives a continuous function in it , the limit @xmath80 will amount to setting @xmath81 in ( [ e : betatrace ] ) .",

    "it is possible to re - express this fourier transform as a one - dimensional real integral .",
    "if we choose polar coordinates in the @xmath94-plane , utilize the following integral representation for the bessel functions of the first kind,@xmath95 @xmath96 and , finally , denote @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we have @xmath99.\\ ] ]    the integral representation ( [ e : kint ] ) can now be used to derive a series expansion for the kernel . since @xmath100 the expansion of the exponential @xmath101 $ ] and a subsequent term by term integration will give @xmath102 \\over     \\sqrt{2 \\pi { \\varepsilon}^2 } }    \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\sum_{k=0}^n       { ( -s_0)^k \\over k ! } { \\left(w - s_1\\right)^{n - k }   \\over ( n - k ) ! }          { 2^{\\nu-1+n\\over 2 } \\gamma\\!\\left({\\nu+1+n\\over 2}\\right ) \\over          \\gamma(\\nu+1+k)},\\ ] ] which , however , has no immediate applications for evaluation of the kernel , because the convergence of the sum will be too slow for large values of the parameters .",
    "so far , the best way to evaluate the kernel @xmath103 for large enough range of parameter values has been a numerical integration of eq.([e : kint ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the well - developed methods of computation of the values of the bessel functions",
    ". similar methods  recursion relations , integral representations , etc.will likely offer more efficient ways of evaluating the kernel as well .",
    "however , since the numerical integration was sufficiently fast for our purposes , we do not pursue this point further here .",
    "the purpose of this section is to enable a monte carlo integration of the lattice expectation values in ( [ e : ltrace ] ) . from the experience in the lattice quantum field simulations",
