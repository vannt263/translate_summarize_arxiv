    "the field of quantum information theory has grown considerably in the last two decades , achieving important results on the characterization of quantum correlations and on their applicability to quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "quantum protocols consist in two or more agents sharing quantum correlated states , which can help them to perform computational and technological tasks .",
    "the vast majority of the work in quantum information theory has been developed in the setting of distinguishable particles where each agent owns a given number of particles .",
    "however , quantum mechanics predicts that particles behave differently when they are identical @xcite .",
    "the key point is that identical particles can not be individually addressed : an agent can not distinguish which particle he is manipulating .",
    "experimental realizations of quantum information processes consist of identical particles , e.g. photons , atoms in optical lattices , or electrons in solid state systems .",
    "for instance , ultracold atomic gases @xcite can be controlled with very high precision , and therefore are a promising arena for the study of many - body physics and applications in quantum information .",
    "identical particles can be distinguished if appropriate degrees of freedom , e.g. spatial confinements , unambiguously characterize each particle .",
    "the properties in terms of these degrees of freedom , e.g. their individual positions , are employed to label each particle @xcite , without being further manipulated .",
    "based on this remark , many proposals suggest to encode states of distinguishable particles into systems of identical particles @xcite , in order to implement quantum information processing .    nevertheless , if one aims to build an integrated architecture , it is difficult to effectively distinguish identical particles . in particular , it can be required to exploit all the accessible degrees of freedom , in order to encode the desired protocol , with no way to label or distinguish particles . for these reasons , the peculiarities of identical particles should be properly considered for a good definition of quantum correlations and for practical purposes of quantum information processing . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the analysis of a specific quantum protocol , the generalization of teleportation @xcite with massive , identical particles , and on the use of entangled states to improve achievable teleportation performances .",
    "entanglement , which is considered a key resource for teleportation , was debated for identical particles under several assumptions @xcite .",
    "we apply the approach developed in @xcite , where entanglement is defined via non - classical correlations between subsets of observables .",
    "this is a very general and powerful approach that recovers the standard definition of entanglement for distinguishable particles , while for systems of identical particles it accounts for quantum correlations between occupations of orthogonal modes in the fock space .",
    "applying this framework to quantum information processing , each agent owns and locally manipulates modes , such as wells in optical lattices or hyperfine levels of molecular systems , which can be experimentally addressed @xcite .",
    "a key feature of massive particles , like atoms and constituents of condensed matter systems , is the conservation of the number of particles , mathematically described by a superselection rule @xcite .",
    "this feature is responsible for a very different behaviour of entanglement among identical particles as compared to the case of photons and distinguishable particles , manifest , for instance , in a simpler detectability of entanglement @xcite , a high robustness against noise @xcite , and a different geometry of entangled states @xcite .",
    "the properties of entanglement in its presently used definition have been studied in fermionic superconducting systems @xcite , electrons in low - dimentional semiconductors @xcite , and bosonic ultracold gases @xcite , and exploited in several applications , such as quantum data hiding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , bell s inequalities @xcite , dense coding @xcite , and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss teleportation in detail , which plays a fundamental role in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the present analysis unifies and largely generalizes all the previous proposals of teleportation of identical particles , in the light of properties studied in @xcite .    in the original teleportation protocol",
    "@xcite one agent , alice , wants to teleport an arbitrary , perhaps unknown , state to another agent , bob .",
    "alice owns the state to be teleported and a share of a resource state , and bob owns the remaining part of the resource state .",
    "the algorithm of the standard teleportation is the following : _",
    "i ) _ alice performs a projective measurement onto the basis of maximally entangled states of her states ; _ ii ) _ alice sends bob the result of the measurement ; _ iii ) _ bob performs a suitable operation on his state , conditioned on the message he got from alice . in the setting of distinguishable particles , if the shared state is a pure , maximally entangled state , bob ends up with a state identical to the initial state to be teleported , while the state on alice s side has been transformed by the measurement .",
    "otherwise , alice and bob can distil maximally entangled states from a larger number of not maximally entangled states , in order to perform an optimal teleportation @xcite .",
    "the teleportation can also be applied to a part of an entangled state . in this case ,",
    "alice initially owns a subsystem entangled with another subsystem in possession of a third party , and uncorrelated with the resource state and bob s subsystem .",
    "after the teleportation , alice s subsystem is entangled neither with bob s nor with the third party subsystem , while the subsystems respectively owned by bob and the third party become entangled .",
    "this application is called entanglement swapping , and can be useful for sharing entanglement at long distances , required for quantum networks @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ entanglement ] , we give the basic definition of entanglement and review some of its properties . in section [ twomode ]",
    ", we introduce the teleportation protocol , where one mode of a two - mode state is teleported using a two - mode resource state .",
    "the conservation of the total number of particles for the independent operations performed during the teleportation protocol reduces the performance .",
    "this results in the impossibility of a perfect teleportation for any finite number of particles in the resource state . in section [ perf ] ,",
    "we analyse the teleportation efficiency with some exemplary resource states , and show that the efficiency grows with the number of particles in the resource state .",
    "these resource states include the maximally entangled states , but also states that can be more easily prepared , such as su(2 ) coherent states @xcite , and the ground state of a double well potential with intrawell interactions @xcite .",
    "additional details are shown in appendix [ perf.app ] .",
    "we comment on the more cumbersome case of many - mode states to be teleported , as compared to two - mode states , in section [ multimode ] . in section",
    "[ reference ] , we prove the impossibility of perfect teleportation with a finite number of particles , for any teleportation protocol . as a byproduct",
    ", we prove that it is not possible to recover perfect teleportation even considering the usual way to overcome the particle number superselection rule , i.e. to couple the system to a reservoir @xcite .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ discussions ] .",
    "we use a mathematical style ( * definition * , * proposition * ) , in order to emphasize a few key statements .",
    "we now introduce basic definitions and notation which we will rely on in the rest of this paper .",
    "specialist readers already fluent in the algebraic characterization of the entanglement of indistinguishable particles may skip this section and directly proceed to section [ twomode ] .",
    "we start with an algebraic framework which generalizes and recovers both entanglement of distinguishable particles and entanglement of identical particles @xcite .",
    "let us consider a many - body system described by the hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "the algebra of all bounded operators , including all the observables , is denoted by @xmath1 is generated by differentiation of the so - called weyl operators .",
    "any function of the creation and annihilation operators is obtained by a proper differentiation of the weyl operators @xcite . ] . unlike the usual definition @xcite",
    ", we move the attention from the states and the tensor product induced partitioning of @xmath0 to the observables and local structures of @xmath1 .    an _ algebraic bipartition _ of @xmath1",
    "is any pair @xmath2 of commuting subalgebras , @xmath3 .",
    "any element of @xmath4 commutes with any element of @xmath5 , @xmath6=0 $ ] .",
    "the notion of locality lies in the commutativity of the subalgebras , ensuring the compatibility of observables of @xmath4 with observables of @xmath5 .",
    "an operator is said to be _ local _ with respect to the bipartition @xmath2 , if it is the product @xmath7 of an operator @xmath8 in @xmath4 and some @xmath9 in @xmath5 .    with the above definitions",
    ", we can now state the definition of separable and entangled states .",
    "[ ent.state ] a state @xmath10 is said to be _",

    "otherwise , the state is _",
    "entangled_.    let us now focus on many - body systems whose constituents are @xmath14 bosons which fill @xmath15 different modes .",
    "the formalism of second quantization is more convenient for such systems .",
    "let us introduce creation and annihilation operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , for each mode , with the bosonic commutation relations , @xmath18=\\delta_{jl}$ ] .",
    "the total hilbert space @xmath19 of the system is spanned by the fock states    @xmath20 is the occupation number of the @xmath21-th mode such that @xmath22 .",
    "we use tensor product notation to write fock states : for instance , @xmath23 .",
    "we have to keep in mind that this tensor product structure is constrained by the conservation of the number of particles .",
    "the norm - closure of the set of polynomials in all creation and annihilation operators , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , is the algebra @xmath26 .",
    "we define bipartitions of this algebra by splitting the set of creation and annihilation operators into two disjoint sets @xmath27 and @xmath28 with arbitrary @xmath29 .",
    "the norm - closure of all polynomials in the creation and annihilation operators of the first ( second ) set is the subalgebra @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "according to the previous definition [ ent.state ] , a pure state is @xmath30-separable if and only if    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary functions .",
    "mixed @xmath30-separable states are convex combinations of pure @xmath30-separable states .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed analysis .",
    "since the total number of particles is conserved , all the observables and the density matrices commute with the total number operator . in other words",
    ", there is a superselection rule @xcite which forbids any coherent superpositions of states with different total numbers of particles .",
    "this is a key feature of such systems , and at the very heart of some recent results @xcite .",
    "any orthonormal basis of @xmath30-separable states can be relabelled as    @xmath34    the integer @xmath35 in eq .",
    "counts the number of particles in the first @xmath29 modes , while @xmath36 labels the different ways in which @xmath35 particles can fill those modes .",
    "similarly , @xmath37 labels the ways in which the remaining @xmath38 particles can occupy the other @xmath39 modes .",
    "any pure @xmath30-entangled state is a coherent superposition of at least two @xmath30-separable states .",
    "there are two qualitatively different ways to superimpose separable states .",
    "the first is the superposition of states labeled by different @xmath40 , keeping @xmath35 fixed .",
    "physically , the local numbers of particles are fixed in such states , thus the mode - bipartition corresponds to a particle - bipartition . a state which exhibits only these coherences",
    "has a block - diagonal structure in the label @xmath35 :    @xmath41    this class of block - diagonal states includes all the states which are separable and positive under partial transposition ( ppt ) @xcite .",
    "the set of states in each diagonal block , i.e. for each fixed value of @xmath35 , is defined on the span of @xmath42 .",
    "this is a hilbert subspace of dimension @xmath43 , isomorphic to the unconstrained tensor product space @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the mathematical features , and thus their physical consequences , are qualitatively analogous to those of distinguishable particles @xcite .",
    "the sum of the single block dimensions @xcite is the dimension of the total hilbert space    @xmath45    because of the above isomorphism , such states are natural candidates for realizing quantum protocols developed for distinguishable particles with identical bosons @xcite .",
    "the second kind of superposition is the superposition of states labeled by different @xmath35 , which is not compatible with a particle - bipartition .",
    "these states are not block - diagonal and , thus , not ppt @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of such states is more powerful and robust than entanglement of distinguishable particles , because separable states in our framework are condensed to a zero measure subset .",
    "in fact , this kind of entanglement can not be washed out by any mixtures with separable states , and mixtures with entangled states can erase such entanglement only under very special conditions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", local noisy dynamics can not completely dissipate entanglement at finite times @xcite , contrary to what happens to distinguishable particles @xcite .",
    "all these phenomena reflect the fact that the set of separable states has zero measure .    besides its definition ,",
    "entanglement of identical particles can also be quantified with so - called entanglement measures .",
    "the theory of entanglement measures is based on the same principles of that for distinguishable particles @xcite , provided that any physical state commutes with the total number of particles in our framework .",
    "some entanglement measures for identical particles have been discussed in @xcite : negativity , robustness of entanglement and entanglement entropy . in accordance with these entanglement measures",
    ", we call a pure bipartite state of @xmath14 particles maximally entangled if its reduced density matrices are maximally mixed within the subspace with no more than @xmath14 particles . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we use negativity as entanglement measure .    in the following ,",
    "we employ entangled states of identical particles , as defined above , as a resource for quantum teleportation .",
    "we start with discussing a teleportation protocol that uses two - mode states .",
    "the single block dimensions of two - mode states are @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the only contribution to entanglement is due to coherent superpositions among different local particle numbers @xmath35 .",
    "we disuss the teleportation of one mode of a two - mode state @xmath47 with the help of a two - mode , shared resource state @xmath48 . the labels @xmath49 number the modes .",

    "she aims to teleport the state of the second mode to the target mode , the forth one , owned by the receiver , bob . it does not matter whether the first mode is in possession of alice or not .    first",
    ", if @xmath54 alice performs a projective measurement of her modes , that involves projectors @xmath55 , onto the following orthogonal states    @xmath56    ( where the phases @xmath57 ensure the orthogonality ) .",
    "we assess the entanglement and completeness of the basis for a comparison with teleportation protocols for distinguishable particles , because there a complete projective measurement onto maximally entangled states is required for perfect teleportation @xcite .",
    "the states have the same amount of entanglement as the maximally entangled states of @xmath14 two - mode particles .",
    "moreover , they span a @xmath58-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , since the second ( third ) mode can be filled at most by @xmath14 ( @xmath52 ) particles , all the possible pure states of these modes span an @xmath59-dimensional hilbert space . in other words ,",
    "the conservation of the total number of particles applies to each state that is prepared independently , i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and not to the reduced state of the second and the third mode which have interacted with the other modes . on the other hand",
    ", alice performs the measurement independently from the first and the fourth mode , thus the projections on the states ( [ states.meas ] ) must commute with the total number of particles .",
    "therefore , the states ( [ states.meas ] ) do not define a complete measurement on the second and the third mode .",
    "additional projectors onto the missing subspace should be considered , in order to make the measurement without post - selection trace preserving .",
    "however , the additional projectors can not project onto states with the same amount of entanglement .",
    "we will consider the complete set of orthogonal projectors @xmath55 onto the following basis    @xmath60    where we have defined the function    @xmath61    which equals the cardinality of the sum in equation .",
    "the projection onto the states take into account also the cases when @xmath62 .",
    "the records of alice s measurement are @xmath63 which label the outcome corresponding to the projection onto each basis state .",
    "if alice records @xmath63 , the state changes into    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the identity operator on the @xmath21-th mode , and @xmath66 are the coefficients of the initial state .    at this point the state of bob s mode depends on the outcome of alice s measurement . in order to reconstruct the state",
    "to be teleported , alice sends bob the outcome @xmath63 of her measurement , via a classical channel , and bob subsequently applies the operation @xmath67 to the fourth mode , where    @xmath68    since the conservation of the total number of particles is central in our analysis , we now show that the operations @xmath69 are fully consistent with this conservation law .",
    "indeed , @xmath69 can be implemented by a unitary operation which preserves the total particle number on the forth mode and on an additional fifth mode :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the trace over the fifth mode , and    @xmath72    @xmath73 is the identity matrix on the subspace orthogonal to the support of each @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is a unitary transformation which commutes with the total number of particles .",
    "now , we come to the analysis of the final state and how similar to the original state to be teleported it is .",
    "since bob knows the outcome @xmath63 on alice s side , and accordingly transforms his state , he ends up with the mode @xmath76 of one of the states @xmath77 with probability @xmath78 , as given by the partial trace over the second and the third mode    @xmath79= \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{k , j=\\max\\{0,-l\\}}^{\\min\\{n,\\nu - l\\}}\\left(\\rho_{34}\\right)_{k+l , j+l}\\frac{c_k\\bar c_j}{{\\cal c}_l}|k\\rangle_1{\\,}_1\\langle j|\\otimes|n - k\\rangle_4{\\,}_4\\langle n - j|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath80 .",
    "the average of the teleported state over all possible outcomes on alice s side , which we will use to discuss the performances of the above protocol , is given by the following local operations with classical communication ( locc ) :    @xmath81=\\sum_{l =- n}^\\nu\\sum_{\\lambda=0}^{{\\cal c}_l-1}p_{(l,\\lambda)}\\rho_{14}^{(l,\\lambda)}=\\sum_{l =- n}^{\\nu}\\sum_{k , j=\\max\\{0,-l\\}}^{\\min\\{n,\\nu - l\\ } } c_k\\bar c_j\\left(\\rho_{34}\\right)_{k+l , j+l}|k\\rangle_1{\\,}_1\\langle j|\\otimes|n - k\\rangle_4{\\,}_4\\langle n - j|.\\ ] ]    we stress that the state ( [ teleported ] ) is not bob s final state , but the average over all possible final states at bob s end .",
    "following @xcite , the faithfulness of the teleportation is quantified by the fidelity    @xmath82|\\psi\\rangle,\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 is the uniform distribution over all pure states , and the states @xmath84 and the average teleported state @xmath85 $ ] stem from the same hilbert space .",
    "the teleportation fidelity is the average overlap between the final state of the first and fourth mode and the initial state of the first and second mode , thus measures how similar these states are . in order to define the uniform distribution ,",
    "consider an arbitrary state @xmath86 with @xmath87 , in a hilbert space spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath88 .",
    "re - writing the coefficients @xmath89 , with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the uniform distribution over the pure states is induced by the haar measure of the group of the unitary transformations : can be considered .",
    "for instance , a flat distribution in the variables @xmath92 and @xmath93 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the only differences are some numerical factors , while the scaling with @xmath14 does not change .",
    "we focus on the measure ( [ measure ] ) for comparison with the results in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath94    see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for instance , the average values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 are    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the euler s gamma function @xcite and @xmath100 .",
    "inserting equation for the average teleported state into the definition of the fidelity , and using the averages and , we derive the following expression    @xmath101    where the function @xmath102 comes from counting the number of times each term @xmath103 appears within the triple sum inherited by equation . , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , appears in the triple sum of equation @xmath106 times if @xmath107 , @xmath14 times if @xmath108 , @xmath109 times if @xmath110 , ... only once if @xmath111 , and never if @xmath112 . in order to see this ,",
    "look at the sum over @xmath113 as a squared @xmath114 shadow shifting along the diagonal blocks of @xmath48 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath48 covered at each sweep of the shadow are @xmath115 for @xmath35 and @xmath21 contributing to the sum of . ]    if the agents are not interested in teleporting the state itself , but in sharing as much entanglement as possible between the first and the fourth mode , then a more relevant figure of merit is the measure of entanglement of the final state between the first and the fourth mode . in general , the final state is mixed , and the negativity @xcite is the most easily computable measure of entanglement for mixed states :    @xmath116    where @xmath117 denotes partial transposition @xcite . while in general it vanishes for some entangled states , the negativity of a two - mode state with a fixed number of particles is a faithful measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "given a two - mode state @xmath10 , its negativity is    @xmath118    we consider the double average of the negativity over the outcomes @xmath63 and the uniform distribution of the initial state as a quantifier of the final entanglement :    @xmath119    where the function @xmath102 has the same origin as in equation .",
    "equation ranges between zero and @xmath120 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath121 is proven by noting that the teleportation protocol does not act on the first mode and can not increase the entanglement between the first mode and the rest .",
    "thus , the average final entanglement @xmath122 is not larger than the average entanglement over all pure initial states , namely @xmath123 .",
    "the entanglement of each final state @xmath77 is independent of whether the local operation @xmath69 has been performed .",
    "we notice that    @xmath124    follows from the triangle inequality for the absolute value applied to , and from the positivity of the fidelity @xmath125 .",
    "we will use this inequality to translate properties of the fidelity to properties of the average teleported entanglement .",
    "let us briefly comment on the case of a non - entangled state @xmath47 instead of the state .",
    "this case is not of practical interest for two reasons .",
    "first , it does not allow for the protocol of entanglement swapping .",
    "second , the perfect teleportation of the second mode of such a state is possible without any entangled resource state .",
    "indeed , the non - entangled two - mode states are only the fock states in the choosen basis of modes @xcite .",
    "in particular , the states of the second mode are the fock states @xmath126 , with @xmath127 . in order to broadcast the information of this state ,",
    "it is enough that alice measures the number operator @xmath128 , which provides the full information on @xmath129 , and communicates the result to bob .",
    "then , bob can prepare locally the state @xmath130 .",
    "it is however instructive to look at the fidelity of the teleportation protocol in this case .",
    "equation ( [ fidelity ] ) with @xmath127 tells us that the state @xmath126 can not be teleported if @xmath131 or @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the teleportation protocol - fails to teleport any state of the fock basis of the second mode , and the linearity of the protocol implies the following property :    [ prop1 ] the above teleportation protocol - can not perfectly teleport an arbitrarily entangled state @xmath47 .",
    "the teleportation fidelity is @xmath133 .",
    "one can wonder whether there is a better protocol which achieves @xmath134 .",
    "the answer is negative , as we prove below , even considering the most general class of teleportation protocols . before discussing generalizations of the above teleportation",
    ", we analyse the performances of the protocol presented in this section with some exemplary resource states .",
    "in this section , we discuss the teleportation performances quantified by the fidelity and the average final entanglement of several interesting resource states , i.e. maximally entangled states , n00n states , su(2 ) coherent states , and the ground state of a double well potential , as regards their relevance in other physical processes .",
    "additional details are exposed in appendix [ perf.app ] .",
    "we identify the useful states for teleportation , namely those states that outperform the separable states when employed for the teleportation protocol .",
    "the additional contribution to the fidelity , with respect to that of separable states , can be negative , unlike the contribution to the average final entanglement",
    ". moreover , not all of the off - diagonal entries are relevant for teleportation .",
    "indeed , the entries @xmath135 with @xmath112 do not enter in the formula of the fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) and of the average final entanglement ( [ av.ent ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , separable resource states , namely    @xmath136    provide threshold performances that define useful resource states .",
    "the teleportation fidelity and the average entanglement are the same for all resource states of this type :    @xmath137    it is worth mentioning that @xmath138 equals the highest teleportation fidelity achievable with resource states of distinguishable @xmath139-level systems , which are separable or positive under partial transposition @xcite .",
    "this latter observation is consistent since resource states with a fixed number of particles are special cases of unconstrained states , e.g. photonic modes , which in turn are mathematically equivalent to states of distinguishable @xmath139-level systems .",
    "let us now consider the pure , maximally entangled resource state @xmath140 of @xmath52 two - mode particles @xcite , where    @xmath141 , the state of the second mode is perfectly teleported to the fourth mode .",
    "these outcomes occur with probability @xmath142 , see appendix [ perf.app ] .",
    "the direct computation of the teleportation fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) with elementary summations leads to    @xmath143    which is always larger than the fidelity @xmath138 of separable resources , and is arbitrary close to one if @xmath144 . under this condition ,",
    "the probability of the outcome @xmath63 with @xmath145 or @xmath146 is negligible , and the initial state is almost perfectly teleported .",
    "the average entanglement of the teleported state is straightforwardly computed :    @xmath147    which is smaller than the average entanglement @xmath120 over all pure states , and converges to this value for @xmath144 .",
    "exemplary entangled resource states which are _ not _ useful for teleportation are the so - called n00n sates with @xmath52 particles :    @xmath148 for the case @xmath149 , which slightly outperforms separable resource states without qualitative improvement .",
    "these features of n00n states are remarkable , because they are the most useful states in the high accuracy estimation of the relative phase between the two arms of an atomic interferometer @xcite .",
    "the apparent imbalance of their performance for different purposes can be explained because coherence among all fock states , thus strong mode - entanglement , is needed to implement accurate teleportation , whereas only coherence between two fock states with highly unbalanced population in two modes , thus weak mode - entanglement , is required for precise phase estimation .",
    "indeed , accurate phase estimation is achieved with states that sensitively vary under phase shifts , and corresponds to a heisenberg - like relation where the larger the variance of relative occupation number , the smaller the accuracy of the phase .",
    "moreover , the counterpart of n00n states in first quantization , i.e. the so - called ghz states , are used to perfectly teleport states of distinguishable particles in low dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite .",

    "the fidelity of this protocol is bounded from below by @xmath202 , which is the probability that each mode is perfectly teleported .",
    "figure [ fid.modes ] shows that this is not a sharp bound , since the fidelity of the teleportation of each single mode can be larger than this lower bound , as discussed above .",

    "it is however an extremely useful resource for the just mentioned procol .",

    "the subspace of these states is isomorphic to the unconstrained tensor product space @xmath44 , and thus to the space of two distinguishable systems of dimensions @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectivelty .",

    "this latter example has been derived within the formalism of first quantization @xcite , and seems a bit intricate because of the permutation invariance of states . on the other hand , in second quantization",
    "we only need to straightforwardly apply the usual teleportation protocol , because the symmetrization is implicitly included in the formalism .",
    "now , we can wonder whether we can teleport all the modes in @xmath193 in one single run even for non - block - diagonal initial states . generalizing the protocol in section [ twomode ]",
    ", alice performs a projective measurement on the modes in @xmath193 and @xmath197 .",
    "the measurement projects onto states that generalise to the case of many - mode subsystems .",
    "some of these states are @xmath14-particle maximally entangled with respect to the bipartition @xmath208 , in analogy to the two - mode states ( [ states.meas ] ) with @xmath209 , and other states have more than @xmath14 particles and the same amount of entanglement than the previous ones , generalising the two - mode states ( [ states.meas ] ) with @xmath210 .",
    "two main difficulties arise in this protocol , which decrease the fidelity and forbid a perfect teleportation .",
    "the first comes from the mismatch between the dimension of the reduced states of @xmath193 and @xmath197 and the number of orthogonal projectors onto states with the same amount of entanglement , as happens for the two - mode states where we completed the measurement with additional projectors ( [ states.meas.2 ] ) .",

    "it exists for the fock space of @xmath14 two - mode particles , for the fock space of one @xmath15-mode particle symmetrically halved in two mode - partitions ( @xmath211 ) , and in the special case of @xmath212 particles that fill @xmath213 modes divided into two equal parties ( @xmath214 ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a straightforward computation shows that a complete basis of maximally entangled states does not exist for one particle in @xmath15 modes which are split into two unequal sets ( @xmath215 ) , or for @xmath212 @xmath216-mode particles .",
    "it is not clear whether the existence of such bases is related to the symmetry of the algebraic bipartition .",
    "the impossibility of such a complete orthonormal basis reduces the number of projectors in alice s measurement , that generalise ( [ states.meas ] ) and allow for a perfect teleportation .",
    "we showed that the performance of the above teleportation protocol with two - mode states is limited by the conservation of the total number of particles .",
    "the limitation comes from the impossibility of a complete projective measurement such that each outcome provides perfect teleportation .",
    "this in turn stems from the fact that the second and the third mode are entangled with the other modes , thus their reduced state does not have a fixed number of particles , while alice s projectors do .",
    "one can wonder whether there is a different protocol that provides perfect teleportation .",
    "possible generalizations allow many - mode states , different perhaps non - projective measurements on alice s side , and the use of a general resource state .",
    "a more interesting generalization is to relax the constraint of total particle number conservation .",
    "nevertheless , in this section , we will prove that the teleportation fidelity is never one , for any general teleportation protocol using a finite number of particles .    before discussing this statement",
    ", we recall the basic idea of relaxing conservation laws in quantum information protocols . the presence of a conservation law is formulated in terms of a superselection rule , namely the requirement that all the physically addressable states and observables commute with the conserved quantities .",
    "this requirement was connected to the lack of a reference frame , as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "for instance , any operator @xmath217 compatible with the conservation of the total particle number is invariant under the twirling operation @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the total number operator .",
    "this means that the phase @xmath220 is not observable if the particle number is conserved , and that the physical operators are uniformly averaged over the phase shift @xmath221 . on the contrary , if the different values of @xmath220 can be distinguished with respect to a phase reference , the physical operators are no longer invariant under the twirling operation .",
    "the standard method to bypass the constraints imposed by the superselection rule @xcite involves embedding the original system into a larger one , allowing interactions with a reservoir .",
    "the conservation law applies only to the total system , while the original system is much less constrained .",
    "we then apply the invariance of physical operators under twirling operation with respect to the number of particles @xmath222 of the systems plus that of the reservoir , @xmath223 : @xmath224 .",
    "equivalently , the phase @xmath220 conjugated to the total number of particles of the system plus the reservoir is not observable .",
    "nevertheless , since the relative particle number @xmath225 is not a conserved quantity , the local phase conjugated to @xmath222 can be distinguished by measurements of the reservoir that , thus , provides a quantum phase reference . to give a specific example , the two - mode state @xmath226 and the operator @xmath227 do not satisfy the particle number superselection rule , while the three - mode state @xmath228 and the operator @xmath229 do , and reproduce the same statistics of the previous two - mode case .",
    "a natural question is whether this approach allows to overcome all the restrictions imposed by the superselection rule , such as the impossibility of perfect teleportation shown in proposition [ prop1 ] and in section [ perf ] .",
    "for instance , any unconstrained operations on the original systems can be mimicked by suitable operations on the total system @xcite .",
    "this consideration was used to prove that any unconstrained quantum protocol consisting of local unitary operations can be mimicked , controlling the interactions with local reservoirs @xcite .",
    "this result is not directly applicable to general processes which consist of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . in the present paper",

    "* the above proof can be generalized to a scenario where alice projects onto pure states with different total numbers of particles and when the resource state is a mixture of states with different total numbers of particles .",
    "indeed , the operation @xmath240 can be optimized only for one choice of the couple @xmath270 , introducing addional errors for the other values .",
    "* we can further generalize the argument when alice projects onto degenerate subspaces . in this case",
    ", the modes in @xmath193 and @xmath197 will be entangled with the other modes , providing a decrease of the fidelity when they are traced out .",
    "* there is no loss of generality in considering projective measurements on alice s side .",
    "in fact , it is known @xcite that any quantum operation , e.g a generalized measurement or completely positive map , is equivalent to a unitary operation @xmath166 followed by a projective measurement on an enlarged system .",
    "thus , unitary operations @xmath166 on alice s side do not change bob s final state , and the extension of the system can be gathered in the set @xmath197 .",
    "hence , this more general scheme is absorbed by the previous case .",
    "* if no projective measurements are involved , there is no broadcast of information to bob s end . when a projective measurement is performed , information is teleported to bob s modes .",

    "there is still the possibility to consider an infinite number of particles .",
    "we have already shown that such an asymptotic , perfect teleportation is possible with the teleportation protocol described in section [ twomode ] , without any further generalization .",
    "we have discussed how the teleportation protocol can be applied to the case of identical massive particles . due to the indistinguishability of particles , we applied a general notion of entanglement between subalgebras of observables . as a consequence , we identified local parties with orthogonal modes , such as in optical lattices where we can split the wells into groups .",
    "we considered the following situation : a sender , alice , wants to teleport the state of one of her modes to a mode owned by a receiver , bob . to this aim",
    ", they use an entangled shared two - mode state . in general , the mode whose state alice wants to teleport can be entangled with another mode .",
    "we computed the general formula of the teleportation fidelity , that is the average overlap between the initial pure state and the teleported state , and the average entanglement of the teleported state , when one mode of a two - mode state is teleported .",
    "we proved that the conservation of the total number of particles forbids the fidelity to be one for a finite number of particles , even if coherent interactions with a reservoir are allowed to overcome the superselection rule .",

    "in this appendix , we describe some additional details on teleportation performaces with the resource states discussed in section [ perf ] .          which is diagonal in the fock basis , because , after alice s measurement , the state is always separable .",

    "this projection exactly recovers the initial state , if @xmath280 , resulting in a perfect teleportation , namely the mapping from the second mode to the fourth mode , which occurs with probability @xmath142 .",
    "all the other outcomes result in the partial teleportation of the component @xmath281 , with probability @xmath282 .",
    "this lead to teleportation fidelity and to average maximally entanglement .",
    "a possible strategy to optimize the performance of the teleportation protocol is to increase the probability of the perfect teleportation . on the one hand ,",
    "such probability @xmath283 increases with the ratio @xmath284 and goes to one when @xmath285 .",
    "this requires the ability to prepare states for a very large number of particles @xmath52 . on the other hand , considering a fixed and finite number of particles @xmath52 , we can improve the probability of perfect teleportation with repeated teleportations .",
    "if alice s projection onto corresponds to a value @xmath145 or @xmath146 , which does not allow a perfect teleportation , she teleports another copy of the original state until she gets the outcome @xmath280 , namely a perfect teleportation .",
    "after @xmath286 runs of the teleportation protocol , the probability of perfect teleportation is              therefore all the maximally entangled resource states provide the same performance , up to local unitary operations .",
    "these local unitary operations can be reabsorbed in the protocol , for instance redefining @xmath69 .",
    "the choice in maximizes the fidelity of the maximally entangled state , whereas it is not optimal for other maximally entangled states which can lead to a fidelity smaller than that of separable states .",
    "the redefinition of @xmath69 , by absorption of the unitaries , does not affect the average final entanglement @xmath292 .                  that are directly computed from the general equations and .",
    "the second term of is the additional contribution to the fidelity with respect to separable resources .",
    "it is negligible for large @xmath297 , increases with decreasing @xmath298 , and contributes to the teleportation fidelity at the same order as @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the resulting improvement gives at most a larger prefactor , without changing the scaling with the numbers of particles .",
    "moreover , the average final entanglement is of order one , while the maximum value of the negativity and its average over all pure states scale linearly with @xmath14 .",
    "we stress that the operations @xmath299 are fully consistent with the conservation of the total particle number , which plays a crucial role in our study .",
    "indeed , @xmath300 can be implemented with a unitary operation on the third mode and on an additional fifth mode , to preserve the total particle number : @xmath301 , where @xmath71 is the trace over the fifth mode , and      @xmath303 is the identity matrix on the subspace orthogonal to the support of each of the other terms .",
    "thus , @xmath304 is a unitary transformation which commutes with the total number of particles .",
    "analogously , @xmath305 can be implemented with a total number preserving unitary operation on the fourth mode and an additional sixth mode .",
    "in addition to the discussion in section [ su2.coh.states ] and from figures [ fid.sym.coh ] and [ ent.sym.coh ] , we note that the su(2 ) symmetric coherent state @xmath162 outperforms the maximally entangled states for @xmath306 up to large particle numbers @xmath52 .",
    "the intuitive reason is the following : if a maximally entangled state is employed as a resource , the teleportation is perfect whenever alice measures @xmath63 with @xmath307 , which happens with a probability @xmath142 .",
    "the teleported state resulting form any other of alice s outcomes is a projection ( [ proj.q ] ) of the original state . for a symmetric coherent resource state ,",
    "the teleportation corresponding to alice s outcomes @xmath63 , with @xmath307 , is slightly distorted with respect to the perfect teleportation , but these outcomes do occur with higher probability than in the case of the maximally entangled resource state .",
    "as an example of entangled resource state that does not outperform separable states , we numerically checked that the teleportation fidelity of the coherent state @xmath308 is smaller than the fidelity of separable states @xmath138 , for @xmath309 $ ] and @xmath310 $ ] .",
    "indeed , from figure [ perf.coh ] the maximum fidelity with su(2 ) coherent resource states is achieved for the symmetric state @xmath162 .",
    "any coherent state is equivalent to any other coherent state with the same value of @xmath150 and different phases @xmath152 , up to local unitary operations on the modes , i.e. of the form @xmath311 with a given function @xmath312 .",
    "this means that coherent states with the same @xmath150 but different @xmath152 have the same entanglement @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these local operations can be reabsorbed in the operations @xmath69 , changing the teleportation protocol and thus its performance .",
    "consistently , we find a dependence of the fidelity on the phase @xmath152 , even if neither the entanglement of su(2 ) coherent resource states nor the average final entanglement they produce change with @xmath152 .      in this section ,",
    "we stress some features of teleportation performances with the resource state being the ground state of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "we numerically observed that the behaviour of the fidelity and of the average final entanglement , when the ground state is chosen in the double gaussian regime , are qualitatively the same as in the single gaussian regime .",
    "the reason is that for small ( large ) @xmath52 the gaussians are highly peaked ( strongly spread out ) , and the small ( large ) coherence among fock states , thus the entanglement , justify low ( high ) teleportation performances . increasing @xmath52 ,",
    "the spread of the gaussians increases monotonically , as well as the teleportation performances .",
    "unfortunately , there is no explicit formula for the ground state in the critical regime .",
    "the fidelity @xmath180 and the average final entanglement @xmath181 are larger than the fidelity @xmath189 and the average final entanglement @xmath292 of the maximally entangled state , respectively , for small values of @xmath14 up to large @xmath52 .",
    "the intuitive reason is the same as the one given above for the symmetric coherent state . the number of such values of @xmath14 increases when @xmath174 approaches @xmath313 , and decreases to zero when @xmath174 moves away from @xmath313 . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "i.e. @xmath314 , the exact ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ bh ] ) is the symmetric coherent state with @xmath157 and @xmath315 .",
    "indeed , the symmetric coherent state is approximated by the gaussian state ( [ gauss ] ) with @xmath314 , as can be seen by application of stirling s approximation @xcite for a large number of particles @xmath52 .",
    "consistently , the fidelities and the average final entanglement of these resource states have very similar quantitative behaviours , like in figures [ fid.sym.coh ] and [ ent.sym.coh ] .    102ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop _",
