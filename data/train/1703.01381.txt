    "heavy metals , including chromium , arsenic , copper , nickel , selenium , technetium , uranium , and zinc , are widespread and hazardous subsurface contaminants in groundwater aquifers @xcite . for many heavy metals ,",
    "their most stable oxidation state is often the most toxic @xcite , and this oxidation state is typically the highest that occurs under near - surface conditions .",
    "additionally , the chemical reduction of certain metals is known to reduce their mobility @xcite . this has inspired efforts to manipulate in situ conditions to stimulate microbial growth and achieve biologically mediated metals reduction .",
    "this technique has been demonstrated , at least in some settings , for chromium , uranium and selenium @xcite , nickel @xcite , technetium @xcite , and copper @xcite , and has been noted as a viable bioremediation technique by recent critical reviews @xcite .",
    "bioprecipitation , a process by which microbiological exudates react with metals to produce an insoluble compound , has been widely observed @xcite and has been noted by @xcite as a remediation method .",
    "bio - stimulants have also recently been shown to effectively reduce chromium through abiotic redox pathways @xcite , and after fermentation for other metals @xcite .",
    "naturally , designing a remedial intervention using one of this family of techniques benefits greatly from the use of a multi - dimensional / multi - component numerical model of groundwater flow , contaminant transport , and biogeochemical processes to evaluate different remediation strategies under varying field conditions .",
    "the model should be capable of capturing the transport behavior of electron donors , biomass , and other species , dominant biogeochemical reactions , and how these processes influence and are influenced by subsurface flow .",
    "although the development on in situ bioreactive transport models goes back to at least the 1980s , the literature is not vast .",
    "early work focused on in situ bioremediation of toxic organic compounds through oxidation .",
    "a thorough mathematical and 2d numerical study representative of this approach is due to @xcite , who presented a three - equation model involving a mobile electron donor ( assumed to be the contaminant ) , mobile dissolved oxygen , and immobile biomass .",
    "the contaminant was assumed to be consumed only in the microbial growth reaction , which was linear in biomass , monod @xcite in electron donor , and monod in electron acceptor .",
    "@xcite subsequently extended a reactive model of this sort to three dimensions to simulate biodegradation of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite presented a more complicated , unsaturated three - dimensional model , which introduced monod dependence on nutrients , and the potential for two electron donors , with one inhibiting the other .",
    "this approach was further elaborated upon in a study of tce degradation @xcite by accounting for living and dead microbes , microbial predators , and first - order kinetic sorption of all aqueous species ( microbes were treated as mobile ) .",
    "another complex oxidation model was developed by @xcite , which explicitly modeled both mobile and immobile biomass , contained a decay network , and featured both anaerobic and aerobic oxidation , in competition .",
    "the development of models for metal reduction is comparatively more recent . for u(vi ) , field - scale modeling studies have been performed on bio - reduction under anaerobic conditions at the old rifle site in colorado @xcite .",
    "these conceptions treat the contaminant as the sole electron acceptor , with an externally applied electron donor , and the implied equations have a similar form to those devised by @xcite : linear in biomass , monod in contaminant , and monod in electron donor . for clarity , this is expressed symbolically as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , is the u(vi ) concentration , @xmath3 is the biomass concentration , @xmath4 is the electron donor concentration , @xmath5 is the metal reduction monod constant , and @xmath6 is the electron donor monod constant .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath7 respectively represent the concentration of @xmath2 and @xmath4 at which the reaction rate is halved .",
    "recently , @xcite have published a numerical study of a column experiment with multiple species , all of whose dynamics are of the above form , but including an extra chemical inhibition factor .",
    "the models of @xcite were implemented at field - scale in crunchflow @xcite , using its capability to represent single and multiple monod formulations .",
    "systems of governing reactive transport equations for enzymatic microbial cr(vi ) reduction have been presented by @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "@xcite described the cr(vi ) degradation reaction slightly differently from @xcite : @xmath8 @xmath9 is the concentration of cr(vi ) at which the reaction rate is halved , which is similar to @xmath10 .",
    "however , although ( [ eq : mu alam ] ) appears superficially similar to ( [ eq : mu li ] ) , the @xmath2 factor represents entirely different behavior : not as an energy source but rather as an inhibitor . interestingly , since the rhs of ( [ eq : mu alam ] ) is a proxy for the biomass growth reaction , @xmath2 consumption is modeled as proportional to biomass growth , but the biomass growth rate is modeled as independent of @xmath2 .",
    "biomass dynamics were governed by a growth term proportional to donor consumption and a first - order decay term , accounting for eventual biomass die - off .",
    "other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have used a similar approach .",
    "@xcite presented a relatively complex model which included transport with both mobile and immobile biomass , and also included two enzymes ( both created due to biomass growth , but one conserved , and one irreversibly consumed during bio - reduction ) . neglecting the irreversibly - consumed enzyme and the mobile - immobile behavior , this model shares its electron donor and biomass dynamics with the model of @xcite .",
    "it differs significantly from other models that we are aware of by treating the cr(vi ) degradation reaction in this model as an incidental enzymatic process , and is governed by the following monod equation : @xmath11 there is strong experimental support for this approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this is arguably more defensible in a real complex geochemical system in which there are multiple competing donors and receptors , and given that there is evidence for indirect reduction pathways , e.g. , by metabolites @xcite .",
    "all of the models of cr(vi ) bio - reduction , discussed above , appear to be one - dimensional only .",
    "our literature review did not reveal discussion of field - scale bio - reduction models for other heavy metal species .",
    "it thus appears that the primary example of a bio - reduction model applicable to modeling a real - world remediation scheme is the crunchflow model of uranium treatment at the rifle site , which was discussed above .",
    "we set out to develop a new model , dubbed chrotran , which is optimized for modeling bioremediation of cr(vi ) , but of sufficient generality that it might be used for bioremediation of other metals , or for abiotic reduction , with ease .",
    "the key features of the model we developed are as follow :    direct abiotic reaction between electron donor and contaminant : :    recent experimental results @xcite have established a rapid    direct redox reaction when molasses is used as an electron donor and    cr(vi ) is the contaminant , rather than the bio - mediated reaction    previously posited .",
    "it is thus crucial to include this behavior in a    model aimed at remediation design .",
    "indirect monod kinetics : :    on account of the evidence @xcite for modeling cr(vi )    degradation with ( [ eq : cr monod ] ) , we implemented this general    formulation as opposed to one which ties all contaminant degradation    to a single biomass growth equation .",
    "bio - fouling / bio - clogging : :    it is well known in practice that one of the problems afflicting    bioremediation schemes is build - up of biological material near the    amendment injection point .",
    "this reduces the hydraulic conductivity ,    interfering with amendment injection , and may rapidly consume any    amendment that does manage to pass through it .",
    "the model thus contains    feedback between local biomass concentration and flow parameters such    as porosity and hydraulic conductivity .",
    "biomass crowding : :    similarly , if biomass becomes overly dense , this causes cell stress ,    which reduces the rate of further growth .",
    "since clogging is enabled ,    this behavior was added as well .",
    "modeling of amendment additives : :    to address clogging or to attempt to spread electron donors farther    from the well before they are consumed , additional chemicals may be    injected to reduce biomass concentrations , and their reactive    transport behavior is incorporated .",
    "multiple donor consumption pathways : :    the best model of electron donor consumption by biomass may be    proportional to biomass concentration or biomass growth , and the model    can handle any such combination .",
    "building this functionality required custom programming beyond what is embedded in existing reactive transport codes @xcite . to accomplish our goal",
    ", we turned to pflotran @xcite , which is open source , has a modular structure , and a `` reaction sandbox '' interface @xcite that allows derivative versions with custom reaction behavior to be developed and compiled . in this fashion , no changes to the flow and transport part of pflotran are needed .",
    "we developed chrotran based on the existing pflotran code framework , taking advantage of the reaction sandbox interface to implement complex model features not included in basic microbial packages and leverage other aspects of pflotran , such as its high - performance computing capabilities .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present the mathematical details of chrotran and justify some of the decisions underlying the model . in section 3 , we discuss how to install and use the software . in section 4 , we present two numerical studies which illustrate chrotran and also suggest an interesting conclusion regarding cr(vi ) remediation . in section 5",
    ", we briefly summarize what has been presented .",
    "we consider flow and transport at aquifer scale . conceptually",
    ", the aquifer is modeled as saturated , with incompressible water moving in accordance with darcy s law ( chrotran can also simulate partially - saturated vadose - zone flow and transport ) .",
    "two transport processes are considered , namely , advection with the darcy flow and fickian dispersion .",
    "multiple reaction terms are then added in order to capture the complex chemical dynamics during remediation .",
    "as the model is intended to be used for remedial design , every effort was made to simplify the formulation to use the smallest number of explanatory variables and parameters , and to keep the equations at a high level of abstraction , so they are not tied to one particular set of chemical species .",
    "the following are the several species whose dynamics are captured by the system of reaction equations , each with their own symbols :    biomass , @xmath12}$ ] , : :    representing the concentration of all microbes and their associated    extracellular material .",
    "the quantification of biomass as a `` molar ''    rather than a mass concentration is unusual , and was done for two    reasons : ( i ) to avoid hard - coding units in which biomass concentration    is to be specified , and ( ii ) to simplify presentation of the model , so    all governing equations have the same units .",
    "a mole of biomass should    be understood as an equivalent mass : any quantity can be used , as long    as one uses a consistent definition throughout the model . in the    examples in this paper",
    ", we use the definition 1 mol    @xmath13 1 g of biomass .",

    ", we assume that both the mobile and immobile donor participate equally in all reactions .",

    "we note that , since chrotran is built on top of pflotran , it inherits all of pflotran s groundwater flow modeling capabilities .",
    "this includes the ability to consider unsaturated and otherwise multiphase flow conditions , which are out - of - scope for the present discussion",
    ". please see the pflotran user manual @xcite for details on its complete capabilities .",
    "the hydraulic conductivity is continually updated in accord with the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 [ - ] is the spatially - uniform initial porosity , and @xmath20 is calculated according to @xmath31 where @xmath32}$ ] is the intrinsic biomass density .",

    "we define @xmath35 to be an advective - dispersive transport operator , which characterizes the hydrodynamic effects on solute transport . for @xmath36 , the concentration of an arbitrary mobile species , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dispersion tensor that depends on the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities , molecular diffusion as well as the darcy flux . for the work in this paper",
    ", we will only consider molecular diffusion and thereby we set @xmath39 note that , while this is not shown explicitly for compactness , all symbols in this equation are functions of @xmath21 and @xmath40 .",
    "we define one governing equation for each species , mobile or immobile , as well as two equations defining reaction rate expressions for algebraic convenience .",
    "the equations involve numerous parameters , whose symbols , units , and long - form name in the chrotran input file are summarized in table [ tab : vartiable names ] .",
    "the parameter symbols follow a scheme in which the first letter encodes the physical interpretation of the parameter and the subscript specifies the governing equation in which they participate .",

    "a symbol beginning with @xmath48 is dimensionless , and represents a stoichiometric relationship between a reaction rate and the consumption rate of a certain species . before presenting the equations",
    ", it is useful to review all of the chemical processes that are incorporated into the model :    abiotic reduction : :    this is an aqueous - phase bimolecular reaction between the electron    donor , @xmath4 , and the contaminant , @xmath2 .",
    "it is    modeled with a classical second - order mass action rate law .",
    "bio - reduction : :    this represents the removal of the contaminant , @xmath2 by the    biomass , @xmath3 .",
    "the process is linear in @xmath3 ,    and monod in @xmath2 , which is a common assumption for    bio - mediated processes .",
    "note that we are not assuming that reduction    of @xmath2 is directly tied to any particular cell metabolic    process .",
    "this form is sufficiently general that it can capture other    bio - remediation processes besides bio - reduction of heavy metals .",
    "biocide reaction : :    this is an inter - phase bimolecular reaction between the biocide ,    @xmath49 , and the biomass , @xmath3 .",
    "it is modeled with    a classical second - order mass action rate law , with the added    condition that @xmath3 can not fall below a specified minimum    concentration @xmath50 .",
    "biomass growth : :    the core biomass growth reaction irreversibly consumes electron donor ,    @xmath4 to increase biomass , @xmath3 . as a    biologically catalyzed reaction , it is assumed to be linear in    @xmath3 and monod in @xmath2 .",
    "two inhibition effects    are assumed : a biomass crowding term , tunable with exponent    @xmath51 , attenuates growth rate as the biomass    concentration rises . the nonlethal inhibitor concentration ,    @xmath52 , also reduces the reaction rate as its concentration    increases . mobile - immobile mass transfer ( mimt ) : :    this is a process with first - order kinetics , which models sorptive    retardation of the electron donor .",
