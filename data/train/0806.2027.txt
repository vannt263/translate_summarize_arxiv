    "a classical result of extremal combinatorics , dirac s theorem @xcite , states that a graph @xmath0 on @xmath13 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath14 contains a hamiltonian cycle , i.e. a cycle that passes through every vertex of @xmath0 .",
    "this motivates the general question of determining what minimum degree condition one needs to find a certain structure in a graph .",
    "an important result of this type is the hajnal - szemerdi theorem @xcite , which states that if @xmath0 is a graph on @xmath1 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath15 and @xmath16 divides @xmath1 then @xmath0 has a perfect @xmath17-packing , i.e. , a collection of vertex - disjoint copies of the complete graph @xmath17 on @xmath16 vertices which covers all the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "( the case @xmath18 was obtained earlier by corrdi and hajnal @xcite . )",
    "this was generalised to packings of arbitrary graphs by komls , sarkzy and szemerdi @xcite . confirming a conjecture of alon and yuster @xcite",
    ", they proved that for every graph @xmath19 there is a constant @xmath20 such that if @xmath0 is a graph on @xmath1 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath21 and @xmath22 divides @xmath1 then @xmath0 has a perfect @xmath19-packing .",
    "( here @xmath23 denotes the chromatic number of @xmath19 . ) finally , khn and osthus @xcite determined the minimum degree needed to find an @xmath19-packing up to an additive constant : it is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a rational number in the range @xmath26 $ ] that can be calculated when @xmath19 is given .",
    "another packing result that is closely related to the topic of this paper was obtained by aigner and brandt @xcite and in a slightly weaker form by alon and fischer @xcite . verifying a conjecture of sauer and spencer @xcite",
    ", they proved that a graph @xmath0 on @xmath1 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath27 contains any graph @xmath19 on @xmath1 vertices with maximum degree at most @xmath28 .",
    "it is very natural to ask whether these results have analogues for directed graphs . here instead of degree one may consider the _",
    "minimum semi - degree _ @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the minimum outdegree and @xmath31 is the minimum indegree of a digraph @xmath0 .",
    "a directed version of dirac s theorem was obtained by ghouila - houri @xcite , who showed that any digraph @xmath0 on @xmath1 vertices with minimum semi - degree at least @xmath14 contains a hamilton cycle .",
    "( when referring to paths and cycles in directed graphs we always mean that these are directed , without mentioning this explicitly . )",
    "this result is very closely related to dirac s theorem , as ( some ) extremal digraphs can be obtained from extremal graphs for dirac s theorem by replacing each edge by a pair of arcs , one in each direction ; the proof of the upper bound is more complicated , but not unduly so .",
    "however , the situation becomes more complicated if one considers _",
    "oriented graphs_. an oriented graph is a directed graph that can be obtained from a ( simple ) undirected graph by orienting its edges .",
    "the question concerning the analogue of dirac s theorem in this case was raised by thomassen @xcite , who asked what minimum semi - degree forces a hamilton cycle in an oriented graph . over the years",
    "since the question was posed , a series of improving bounds were obtained in @xcite , until an asymptotic solution of @xmath32 was given by kelly , khn and osthus @xcite .",
    "soon after that an exact answer @xmath33 for @xmath1 sufficiently large was proved by keevash , khn and osthus @xcite .",
    "this result was recently extended by kelly , khn and osthus @xcite , who showed that the same minimum semi - degree condition guarantees that @xmath0 is pancyclic ( contains directed cycles with all lengths @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .    in this paper",
    "we mainly study cycle packings in oriented graphs , although in the concluding remarks we discuss directed graphs as well .",
    "our starting point is the following question posed independently by cuckler @xcite and yuster @xcite .",
    "a tournament is an orientation of a complete graph .",
    "it is regular if every vertex has equal indegree and outdegree",

    "moreover , in some cases our technique allows us to strengthen the previous theorem and to obtain a prescribed _ @xmath8-factor _ , i.e. , a perfect packing by cycles with given lengths . to illustrate this we prove the following result ,",

    "this completes the proof .",
    "in @xcite , cuckler raises the question of counting perfect packings of @xmath48-cycles in regular tournaments ( when @xmath48 does not divide @xmath1 a ` perfect ' packing is defined to have size @xmath594 ) .",

    "somewhat surprisingly , he shows that this is no longer true if @xmath48 is even . in the same paper cuckler",
    "also gives this estimate for counting triangle packings of size @xmath596 in regular tournaments .",
    "our proof of theorem [ triangles ] can be used to show that any oriented graph @xmath0 of order @xmath1 with semidegree @xmath597 has @xmath598 triangle packings covering all but at most @xmath3 vertices ( which are ` perfect ' when @xmath1 is not divisible by @xmath3 ) .",
    "the upper bound on the number of packings follows simply from the fact that the number of cyclic triangles in any tournament of order @xmath1 , and hence also in any oriented graph , is at most @xmath599 . constructing a packing by choosing one triangle every time we see that for the @xmath401-th triangle we have at most @xmath600 choices . dividing by the number of different orderings of the same packing , which is at least @xmath601",
    ", we see that there are at most @xmath602 different packing of cyclic triangles covering all but at most @xmath3 vertices .",
    "next we present a sketch proof for the lower bound .",
    "suppose that the nibble consists of @xmath379 ` bites ' of size @xmath603 with each @xmath604 and @xmath605 .",
    "from the analysis of the nibble in @xcite it is easy to see that at iteration @xmath401 we have an oriented graph on @xmath606 vertices which has @xmath607 cyclic triangles ; then we pick @xmath608 such triangles uniformly at random . therefore , the number of ordered choices of @xmath609 vertex - disjoint cyclic triangles in @xmath0 is at least @xmath610 .",
    "since for @xmath611 we have @xmath612 we conclude that the number of ordered choices of @xmath609 vertex - disjoint cyclic triangles in @xmath0 is at least @xmath613 we can use the absorption argument to convert each of these families of @xmath609 vertex - disjoint cyclic triangles into triangle packings that cover all but at most @xmath3 vertices . note that since the absorption process involves only @xmath123 vertices , each such packing is obtained in at most @xmath614 ways .",
    "note also that for each packing its triangles can have at most @xmath615 different orders .",
    "dividing by this number we obtain that the number of triangle packings covering all but at most @xmath3 vertices in @xmath0 is at least @xmath616 , as required .    as discussed in the introduction , it is also natural to consider questions which we study in this paper for digraphs , rather than oriented graphs .",
    "it appears that such digraph problems tend to be quite closely connected to known extremal results about graphs , and can therefore be answered using these results . here",
    "we mention two illustrative examples :    1 .",
    "a digraph @xmath0 on @xmath1 vertices with minimum total degree ( this is a minimum of @xmath617 over all @xmath618 ) at least @xmath619 has a perfect packing of transitive triangles , when @xmath620 is divisible by @xmath3 and sufficiently large . to see this",
    "consider a random ordering @xmath621 of the vertices of @xmath0 and let @xmath302 be the graph whose edges are all those edges @xmath318 of @xmath0 with @xmath622 .",
    "it is easy to check that with high probability every vertex of @xmath302 has degree at least @xmath623 . now",
    "the corrdi - hajnal theorem ( mentioned in the introduction ) gives a perfect triangle packing in @xmath302 , which by definition corresponds to a packing of digraph @xmath0 by transitive triangles .",
    "2 .   a digraph @xmath0 on @xmath1 vertices with minimum semidegree",
    "at least @xmath624 has a perfect packing of cyclic triangles , when @xmath620 is divisible by @xmath3 and sufficiently large . to see this , randomly partition the vertices of @xmath0 into three disjoint sets",
    "@xmath625 with @xmath626 , @xmath354 .",
    "let @xmath302 be the @xmath3-partite graph whose edges are the edges of @xmath0 which go from @xmath213 to @xmath214 ( addition mod @xmath3 ) .",
    "again , it is easy to check using large deviation inequalities that every vertex of @xmath302 in @xmath213 has at least @xmath627 neighbours in each @xmath313 , @xmath397 .",
    "a result of johansson @xcite implies that @xmath302 has a perfect triangle packing , which by definition gives a cyclic triangle packing in @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , one can easily show that both these results are asymptotically best possible by taking corresponding construction for graphs and replacing each edge by two directed edges with opposite directions .",
    "note that in theorem [ triangles ] we find a triangle packing which covers all but three vertices .",
    "what happens if we slightly relax this requirement ?",
    "in particular , what minimum semidegree condition in an oriented graph of order @xmath1 will give a cyclic triangle packing that covers all but at most @xmath123 vertices ?",
    "we have no good conjecture for this problem .",
    "the following construction shows that the semidegree should be at least @xmath628 .",
    "suppose @xmath107 and divide a set of @xmath1 vertices into three sets @xmath209 with sizes @xmath629 , @xmath630 , @xmath631 .",
    "define an oriented graph @xmath0 as follows . between the classes we take all possible edges and orient them from @xmath213 to @xmath214 ( addition mod @xmath3 ) .",
    "inside each class we place an oriented graph that has no cyclic triangle with minimum indegree and outdegree as large as possible .",
    "for example , a circulant construction gives such an oriented graph on @xmath379 vertices with every indegree and outdegree equal to @xmath632 , and this can not be improved if the caccetta - haggkvist conjecture @xcite is true .",
    "then @xmath0 has minimum indegree and outdegree at least @xmath633 .",
    "since any cyclic triangle must use one vertex from each class , any collection of vertex - disjoint cyclic triangles leaves at least @xmath472 vertices uncovered .",
    "another interesting variation is to consider what minimum semidegree condition is needed to find certain structures in a tournament . here",
    "one would expect a smaller value than that needed for oriented graphs .",
    "for example , using the fact that every strongly connected tournament is hamiltonian ( camion s theorem ) , it is not hard to see that a tournament with minimum semidegree at least @xmath634 contains a hamilton cycle . on the other hand",
    ", we recall that for oriented graphs ones need semidegree at least @xmath224 to get the same conclusion .",
    "it would be interesting to find what minimum semidegree in a tournament of order @xmath1 will give a cyclic triangle packing that covers all but at most @xmath123 vertices .",
    "here it is easy to show a lower bound of @xmath635 ( note it is again smaller than that obtained above for oriented graphs ) .",
