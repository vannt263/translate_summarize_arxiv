    "it is well known that some liquids demonstrate anomalous behavior in some regions of thermodynamic parameters .",
    "the most common and well known example is water .",
    "the water phase diagrams have regions where a thermal expansion coefficient is negative ( density anomaly ) , self - diffusivity increases upon compression ( diffusion anomaly ) , and the structural order of the system decreases with increasing pressure ( structural anomaly ) @xcite .",
    "later on it was discovered that many other substances also demonstrate similar behavior .",
    "some typical examples are silica , silicon , phosphorus and many others @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to relate this kind of behavior to the orientational anisotropy of the potentials , however , a number of studies demonstrate water - like anomalies in fluids that interact through spherically symmetric core - softening potentials with two length scales ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of different core - softened potentials were introduced .",
    "all such systems can be approximately divided into two classes : shoulder - like , composed of a hard - core and a repulsive shoulder , softening the core , and ramp - like systems , composed of a hard - core and a repulsive ramp , establishing two competing equilibrium distances @xcite .",
    "anomalous behavior usually takes place in ramp - like systems , while it is not observed in purely shoulder - like ones .",
    "however , if instead of `` hard '' step one considers a smoothed one the anomalies appear ( see , for example , @xcite .",
    "as it was found in experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite , the water anomalies have a well - definite sequence : the regions where these anomalies take place form nested domains in the density - temperature @xcite ( or pressure - temperature @xcite ) planes : the density anomaly region is inside the diffusion anomaly domain , and both of these anomalous regions are inside a broader structurally anomalous region .",
    "this water - like behavior was found in systems with core - softening potentials @xcite .",
    "however , in other anomalous systems the sequence of anomalies may be different .",
    "for example , the hierarchy of anomalies for silica is different compared to water . in this case the diffusion anomaly region contains the structural anomalous region which , in turn , has the density anomaly region inside @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "this is the only example of such inversion of the order of the anomalies .",
    "this paper presents a simulation study of anomalies in core - softened system introduced in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "we investigate the anomalous regions for a system with the same functional form of the potential but with different parameters and show that the order of the region of anomalous diffusion and the region of density anomaly is inverted .",
    "the article is organized as following : section ii presents the system and methods , section iii describes the results and gives theirs discussion and section iv contains conclusions .",
    "the system we study in the present simulations is smooth repulsive shoulder system ( srss ) introduced in our previous publications @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is `` hard''-core diameter and @xmath3 is soft - core diameter .    in the remainder of this paper we use the dimensionless quantities : @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 .",

    "importantly , in low temperature region the systems can demonstrate slow dynamics . in order to get reliable results in the whole temperature range we used parallel tempering technic @xcite .",
    "the system with @xmath8 and @xmath9 were simulated at densities from @xmath10 till @xmath11 with step @xmath12 ( @xmath13 in the vicinity of anomalous regions ) and at temperatures from @xmath14 till @xmath15 . in the case of @xmath16",
    "the range of densities was @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the density range of @xmath18 - @xmath19 was simulated for @xmath20 . along every isochor we ran several",
    "parallel tempering runs with different temperatures .",
    "lowe - andersen thermostat was used during the equilibration time @xcite .",
    "after equilibration the thermostat was switched off and the system evolved in @xmath21 ensemble for production .",
    "after the production a trial change of temperature was made .",
    "many data points were collected along every isochor ( more then @xmath22 ) . using these data points we constructed @xmath23th order polynomial approximation of internal energy , pressure and diffusion coefficient along isochors .",
    "these approximations were used in the following analysis .    in order to compute the excess entropy of the liquids we used thermodynamic integration method @xcite .",
    "we computed free energy along a high temperature isotherm by integrating equation of state of the system .",
    "after that we computed the free energies along isochors by integrating the @xmath24 function , where @xmath25 is the internal energy @xcite .",
    "excess entropy was obtained as @xmath26 .",
