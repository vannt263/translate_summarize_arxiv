    "we consider the problem of relative localization for sensor networks that can be described as follows .",
    "we assume to have a group of agents representing the nodes of a graph , and a vector , indexed over the agents and unknown to them .",
    "the agents are allowed to take noisy measurements of the differences between their vector entries and those of their neighbors in the graph .",
    "the estimation problem consists in reconstructing the original vector , up to an additive constant . while an optimal solution can be easily found by a centralized least - squares approach ,",
    "we are interested in finding effective _ distributed _ solutions .",
    "more precisely , a solution is said to be distributed if it requires each node to use information which is available only at the node itself or from its immediate neighbors .",
    "following this approach , we have recently proposed  @xcite a randomized `` gossip '' algorithm for distributed relative localization .",
    "this algorithm , which is inspired by a gradient descent approach , involves the activation of a randomly chosen pair of neighboring nodes at each time step . in our previous work",
    ", we have already given a convergence result for the algorithm : the mean - square error between the time - average of the states and the optimal solution asymptotically goes to zero .",
    "in this paper , we study the algorithm using tools from ergodic theory and we obtain a related convergence result : the time - average of the states converges almost surely to the optimal solution .",
    "significantly , our definition of time - average does not require the agents to be aware of any global clock or of any global variable which counts the number of interactions occurring on the network .",
    "the abstract problem of relative localization is deemed to have important applications in sensor and robotic networks  @xcite .",
    "the proposed applications cover synchronization of uncertain clocks  @xcite , as well as spacial localization  @xcite in mobile robotic networks when no absolute position information is available . in the control literature ,",
    "the problem has been popularized by  @xcite . distributed algorithms involving synchronized updates by the nodes have been proposed in the last few years  @xcite .",
    "the latter paper uses a gradient - descent technique to solve the problem : this approach has been later followed in  @xcite , as well as in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "recently , papers have started to consider randomized asynchronous and randomized algorithms to solve the localization problem  @xcite , see  @xcite for details about randomized algorithms .      in this work ,",
    "we prove an ergodic theorem for the algorithm in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 10 ) ) and we show that a suitable time - averaging operation removes the persistent random oscillations which affect the `` raw '' estimates obtained through gossip communication and updates . the resulting time - averaged state converges _ almost surely _ to the optimal solution of the relative localization problem .",
    "the ergodicity analysis of seemingly non - convergent dynamics started to attract attention in the theory of multi - agent systems and distributed control only recently .",
    "for example , we remark that the algorithm under study presents strong similarities with randomized algorithms for the pagerank computation , which have been recently proposed in several papers  @xcite .",
    "indeed , randomized pagerank dynamics have been shown to converge modulo time - averaging : available results cover both convergence in mean square  @xcite and almost sure  @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that our proof of almost sure convergence is based on completely different tools from  @xcite , which uses techniques from stochastic approximation . related applications of ergodic theory can be found in the context of social networks  @xcite , where the authors show the ergodicity of specific opinion dynamics , which extend the well - known consensus dynamics to incorporate external influences and heterogeneous ( stubborn ) agents .",
    "our analysis owes much to these techniques .",
    "furthermore , we stress that ergodicity is a key property in enabling our framework to easily accommodate time - averages . hence",
    ", we study an algorithm which is fully asynchronous and distributed . on the contrary ,",
    "prior work on randomized algorithms assumed time - averages to be computed using a global iteration counter , see  @xcite .",
    "we formally present the problem of relative localization in section  [ sect : localization - problem ] . then , in section  [ sect : algo - main - results ] we define the randomized algorithm and state the main convergence results .",
    "these results are proved by the analysis presented in section  [ sect : analysis ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with some remarks on future research in the final section .",
    "we consider a set of nodes @xmath0 of cardinality @xmath1 , endowed with an unknown scalar quantity @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "the relative localization problem consists , for each node @xmath4 , in estimating the scalar value @xmath5 , based on noisy measurements of differences @xmath6 with certain neighbors @xmath7 .",
    "an oriented graph @xmath8 is used to represent the available measurements .",
    "the orientation of the pairs is conventionally assumed to be such that @xmath9 only if @xmath10 .",
    "we let @xmath11 be the incidence matrix of the graph @xmath12 , which is defined as @xmath13 for every @xmath14 . we let @xmath15 be the vector collecting the measurements @xmath16 where @xmath17 is random noise with @xmath18=0 $ ] and",
    "@xmath19=\\sigma^2i$ ] , and @xmath20 is the identity matrix .",
    "we define the set of the optimal estimates in a least squares sense as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the euclidean norm .",
    "the set @xmath23 is described in the following well - known lemma @xcite .",
    "[ lemma : centralized - ls ] let the graph @xmath12 be connected and let @xmath24 denote the laplacian of the graph .",

    "this section is devoted to describe the algorithm which was proposed in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  v ) and to state our main results .",
    "the algorithm involves for each node @xmath37 a triple of states @xmath38 , depending on a discrete time index @xmath39 : these three variables play the following roles : @xmath40 is the `` raw '' estimate of @xmath2 obtained by @xmath7 at time @xmath41 through communications with its neighbors , @xmath42 counts the number of updates performed by @xmath7 up to time @xmath41 , and @xmath43 is the `` smoothed '' estimate obtained through time - averaging .",
    "the algorithm is defined by choosing a scalar parameter @xmath44 and a sequence of random variables @xmath45 taking values in @xmath46 . at each time @xmath41 , provided that @xmath47 , the state updates are performed according to the following rules : the estimates evolve as    [ dyn2 ] @xmath48 the local times as @xmath49 and the time - averages as @xmath50 [ eq : gossip - algo - ki ]    we assume the sequence @xmath51 to be i.i.d . , and its probability distribution to be uniform , _ i.e. _ , @xmath52=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{e}| } , \\qquad\\forall k\\in{\\mathbb{z}_{\\ge 0}},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the cardinality of @xmath46 .",
    "note that this choice is made without loss of generality and convenience : the same approach may accommodate other distributions , as required by the application .",
    "it should be noted that the time index @xmath41 in fact counts the number of updates which have occurred in the network , whereas for each @xmath4 the variable @xmath54 is the number of updates involving @xmath55 up to the current time .",
    "hence , @xmath56 is a local variable which is inherently known to agent @xmath55 , even in case the common clock @xmath41 is unavailable .",
    "this algorithm is totally asynchronous and fully distributed , in the sense that the time averaging process does not need the nodes to be aware of a common clock .",
