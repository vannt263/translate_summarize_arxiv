    "that model is based on an application of the fourth heisenberg relation to the sea of virtual electron - positron pairs which , combined with the expansion of the universe , would produce a progressive decrease of the optical density of the quantum vacuum , more precisely a progressive decrease of the permittivity and permeability of empty space , the consequence being a very small acceleration of light .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a relativistic version of that newtonian model .",
    "it must be emphasized that a near newtonian situation will be always assumed in this paper , whenever the observed light speed will be mentioned .",

    "it is important , therefore , to emphasize that the light speed can be defined in general relativity in two different ways , ( i ) with respect to the cosmological proper time @xmath0 , @xmath12 , and ( ii ) with respect to the coordinate time @xmath1 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are elements of spatial distance , proper time and coordinate time along a null geodesic , respectively .",

    "light speed \" means usually the constant @xmath17 which , being a universal constant , is of the utmost importance .",
    "however , the non - proper light speed @xmath18 is also used in some interesting cases .",

    "einstein gave two formulae for this effect .",
    "the first ( 1907 ) is based only in the equivalence principle and gives @xmath37 , just one half of the observed effect .",
    "the second ( 1916 ) , in the frame of general relativity , gives the complete result @xmath38 .",
    "the first one can be obtained simply by considering the propagation of a wave light with the previous value of the light speed , in other words as the solution of the variational problem @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the euclidean line element , _",
    "i.e. _ as a consequence of the application of the fermat principle to the non - proper light speed @xmath18 .",
    "the complete effect is obtained by taking instead the non - euclidean spatial line element of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "note that this implies that the problem is solved by assuming that the light propagates through with speed @xmath41 ( taking into account the riemannian character of the spatial metric ) .",
    "the same situation appears in the study of the delay of the radar echoes from the planets .",
    "it will be assumed in this paper , for simplicity , that all the matter and energy in the universe are uniformly distributed .",
    "since the universe is expanding , it is clear that @xmath42 and that there is a functional relation between the two times @xmath11 , determined by the background gravitational potential of all the universe .",
    "all this means that @xmath43 equation ( [ 1.0 ] ) states that _ the light speed @xmath18 increases if the proper time @xmath0 accelerates with respect to the coordinate time @xmath1 _ , its time derivative being equal to the proper light speed @xmath17 times the second derivative of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 .",

    "it must be emphasized again that the proper speed of light @xmath17 is constant in this model , as it must happen in general relativity .",

    "but it is often stated that it is impossible to measure an eventual variation in time of @xmath18 , because it is a dimensional constant .",
    "this does not deny necessarily the existence of an acceleration of light .",
    "however , since the possibility can not be excluded that the standards of length or of time might be changing also , such a measurement would be ambiguous or meaningless . according to this view , widely shared by the metrologists ,",
    "only non - dimensional constants can be measured as functions of time , as would be the case of the fine structure constant for instance .    however , this argument does not consider the fact that the quantity known usually as  the light speed \" has two meanings : the observed speed of light and a constant of physics that appears in einstein s equations ( in fact , it has more than two meanings but these two are more important for the purpose of this work , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is usually assumed as a matter of fact that these two faces are the same one , so that the values of the universal constant ( a theoretical concept ) and of the observed light speed ( an empirical datum ) are always identical .",

    "it can not be excluded a priori that the two values could be different at large scales . in that case",

    "this can be understood easily , just by taking the wave equation with variable speed for the field , for instance @xmath54{\\bf e}=0 $ ] , with @xmath55 ( the same result is obtained by using @xmath56 instead ; note that _ the time in this equation is clearly the coordinate time _ ) . at first order in @xmath45",

    "this has two consequences : ( i ) an increase of non - proper light speed @xmath18 with respect to the coordinate time @xmath1 , @xmath61 , would produce an extra blue shift in radio signals , linearly increasing in time and having the same observational effect as the unmodelled acceleration equal to @xmath5 towards the sun of the pioneer and other spacecrafts , and ( ii ) the atomic clocks would be accelerating , since their periods would be decreasing .",
    "the blue shift would be due to the acceleration of light , not to the motion of the ships which would be following then and now the standard laws of gravitation without any extra pull from the sun .",

    "@xcite , he introduces his principle of equivalence in a static situation , deducing from it that the light speed @xmath18 must depend on the gravitational potential @xmath64 , as well as his first formula for the bending of a light ray grazing a star . according to pais ,",

    "two comments are important here : ( i ) as stated before , these statements by einstein refer clearly to the light speed defined with respect to the coordinate time @xmath72 , as explained in section 1.3 , and ( ii ) they are still valid as first order approximations in general relativity . as einstein himself found later",

    "this section contains the development of some ideas based in a cosmological and global consideration of time .    as explained in section 2 ,",
    "einstein asserted in 1912 that clocks run faster the higher is @xmath18 ( page 104 of the first paper of @xcite ; remember , his definition of the light speed was @xmath63 ) .",

    "i.e. _ an interval of proper time over the corresponding interval of coordinate time .",
    "he was thinking then in clocks at different space points , but the same can be said clearly about clocks at different times : if he had known the universal expansion ( unsuspected however at that time ) he could have added  and , besides , clocks run faster as time goes on \" .",
    "the ( cautious ) claim of this and previous work is that the pioneer acceleration is an effect of the acceleration of light with respect to the coordinate time @xmath1 ( see section 1.3 ) .",
    "these two statements are equivalent . indeed , if the observed blue shift is the consequence of the acceleration of light , the basic units of time ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the periods of electromagnetic waves ) would be decreasing ( see section 1.4 ) , the atomic clocks going faster , and conversely .",
    "otherwise stated , the pioneer effect could be a manifestation of the acceleration of time , as measured by atomic clocks .",

    "it verifies @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
    "this means that these two times , @xmath197 and @xmath0 , do not accelerate with respect to one another , their time intervals being just proportional , the proportionality constant being @xmath198 .",
    "furthermore @xmath199 , what means that , at exactly the time @xmath124 , the corresponding intervals of the times @xmath197 and @xmath1 are equal .",
