    "the method of proof for the local extinction result in  @xcite is a comparison with a mean field model @xmath1 which solves @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a standard brownian motion and where @xmath4 are suitable functions satisfying @xmath5 .",

    "the intuition behind the comparison with the mean field model is that if there is competition ( modeled through the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 in  ) among individuals and resources are everywhere the same , then the best strategy for survival of the population is to spread out in space as quickly as possible .",
    "the results of  @xcite cover translation invariant initial measures and local extinction . for general @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "not much is known about extinction of the total mass process .",
    "let the solution @xmath14 of   be started in @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "we prove in a forthcoming paper under suitable conditions on the parameters that the total mass @xmath17 converges as @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we show in that paper that the limiting process dominates the total mass process of the corresponding system of interacting locally regulated diffusions started in finite total mass .",
    "consequently , a global extinction result for the limiting process would imply a global extinction result for systems of locally regulated diffusions",
    ".    in this paper we introduce and study a model which we call _ virgin island model _ and which is the limiting process of @xmath14 as @xmath6 .",
    "note that in the process @xmath14 an emigrant moves to a given island with probability @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the characteristic property of the virgin island model namely every emigrant moves to an unpopulated island .",
    "our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition ( see   below ) for global extinction for the virgin island model .",
    "moreover , this condition is fairly explicit in terms of the parameters of the model .",

    "evolves a diffusion @xmath20 with state space @xmath21 given by the strong solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath22 where @xmath3 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "this diffusion models the total mass of a population and is the diffusion limit of near - critical branching particle processes where both the offspring mean and the offspring variance are regulated by the total population .",
    "later , we will specify conditions on @xmath23 and @xmath13 so that @xmath24 is well - defined .",
    "for now , we restrict our attention to the prototype example of a feller branching diffusion with logistic growth in which @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "note that zero is a trap for @xmath24 , that is , @xmath29 implies @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "mass emigrates from the @xmath19-th island at rate @xmath32 and colonizes unpopulated islands .",
    "a new population should evolve as the process @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we need the law of excursions of @xmath24 from the trap zero . for this , define the set of excursions from zero by @xmath34 ,       \\,\\chi_t=0{\\ensuremath{\\;\\;\\forall\\;}}t\\in(-\\infty,0]\\cup[t_0,\\infty)\\bigr\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the first hitting time of @xmath36 .",
    "the set @xmath37 is furnished with locally uniform convergence . throughout the paper ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the set of continuous functions and the set of cdlg  functions , respectively , between two intervals @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath41 the _ excursion measure _ @xmath42 is a @xmath43-finite measure on @xmath37 .",
    "it has been constructed by pitman and yor  @xcite as follows : under @xmath42 , the trajectories come from zero according to an entrance law and then move according to the law of @xmath24 .",
    "further characterizations of @xmath44 are given in  @xcite , too .",
    "for a discussion on the excursion theory of one - dimensional diffusions , see  @xcite",
    ". we will give a definition of @xmath42 later .",
    "next we construct all islands which are colonized from the @xmath19-th island and call these islands the first generation .",

    "figure  [ f : excursion_tree ]    illustrates the resulting tree of excursions . for the generation - wise construction ,",
    "we use a method to index islands which keeps track of which island has been colonized from which island .",
    "an island is identified with a triple which indicates its mother island , the time of its colonization and the population size on the island as a function of time . for @xmath45 ,",

    "we assume that the family @xmath65 is independent for every @xmath45 .",
    "the virgin island model is defined recursively generation by generation .",
    "the @xmath19-th generation only consists of the @xmath19-th island @xmath66 the @xmath67-st generation , @xmath68 , is the ( random ) set of all islands which have been colonized from islands of the @xmath49-th generation @xmath69 the set of all islands is defined by @xmath70 the total mass process of the virgin island model is defined by @xmath71 our main interest concerns the behaviour of the law @xmath72 of @xmath73 as @xmath74 .",
    "the following observation is crucial for understanding the behavior of @xmath75 as @xmath74 .",
    "there is an inherent branching structure in the virgin island model .",
    "consider as new `` time coordinate '' the number of island generations .",
    "one offspring island together with all its offspring islands is again a virgin island model but with the path @xmath33 on the @xmath19-th island replaced by an excursion path .",
    "because of this branching structure , the virgin island model is a multi - type crump - mode - jagers branching process ( see  @xcite under `` general branching process '' ) if we consider islands as individuals and @xmath62 as type space .",
    "we recall that a single - type crump - mode - jagers process is a particle process where every particle @xmath76 gives birth to particles at the time points of a point process @xmath77 until its death at time @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are independent and identically distributed .",
    "the literature on crump - mode - jagers processes assumes that the number of offspring per individual is finite in every finite time interval . in the virgin island model , however , every island has infinitely many offspring islands in a finite time interval because @xmath44 is an infinite measure .",
    "the most interesting question about the virgin island model is whether or not the process survives with positive probability as @xmath74 .",
    "generally speaking , branching particle processes survive if and only if the expected number of offspring per particle is strictly greater than one , e.g.  the crump - mode - jagers process survives if and only if @xmath80>1 $ ] .",
    "for the virgin island model , the offspring of an island @xmath81 depends on the emigration intensities @xmath82 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the decisive parameter for survival is the expected `` sum '' over those emigration intensities @xmath83 we denote the expression in   as `` expected total emigration intensity '' of the virgin island model .",
    "the observation that   is the decisive parameter plus an explicit formula for   leads to the following main result . in theorem",
    "[ thm : extinction_vim ] , we will prove that the virgin island model survives with strictly positive probability if and only if @xmath84 note that the left - hand side of   is equal to @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the speed measure of the one - dimensional diffusion  .",
    "the method of proof for the extinction result is to study an integral equation ( see lemma  [ l : integral_laplace_trafo ] ) which the laplace transform of the total mass @xmath87 solves .",
    "furthermore , we will show in lemma  [ l : q_explicit_man_hours ] that the expression in   is equal to the left - hand side of  .",
    "condition   already appeared in  @xcite as necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a nontrivial invariant measure for the mean field model , see theorem 1 and lemma 5.1 in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the total mass process of the virgin island model dies out if and only if the mean field model   dies out .",
    "the following duality indicates why the same condition appears in two situations which seem to be fairly different at first view . if @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 , that is , in the case of feller branching diffusions with logistic growth , then model   is dual to itself , see theorem 3 in  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath14 indeed approximates the virgin island model as @xmath6 , then  for this choice of parameters  the total mass process @xmath75 is dual to the mean field model .",
    "this duality would directly imply that  in the case of feller branching diffusions with logistic growth  global extinction of the virgin island model is equivalent to local extinction of the mean field model .",
    "an interesting quantity of the virgin island process is the area under the path of @xmath87 . in theorem  [ thm : expected_man_hours ]",
    ", we prove that the expectation of this quantity is finite exactly in the subcritical situation in which case we give an expression in terms of @xmath92 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , in the critical case and in the supercritical case , we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the expected area under the path of @xmath87 up to time @xmath93 @xmath94 as @xmath74 for all @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , the order of   is @xmath95 in the critical case . for the supercritical case ,",
    "let @xmath96 be the malthusian parameter defined by @xmath97 it turns out that the expression in   grows exponentially with rate @xmath98 as @xmath74 .",
    "the result of theorem  [ thm : expected_man_hours ] in the supercritical case suggests that the event that @xmath75 grows exponentially with rate @xmath98 as @xmath74 has positive probability .",
    "however , this is not always true .",
    "theorem  [ thm : general : xlogx ] proves that @xmath99 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , this variable is not identically zero if and only if @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "this @xmath103-criterion is similar to the kesten - stigum theorem ( see  @xcite ) for multidimensional galton - watson processes .",
    "our proof follows doney  @xcite who establishes an @xmath103-criterion for crump - mode - jagers processes .",
    "our construction introduces as new `` time coordinate '' the number of island generations .",
    "readers being interested in a construction of the virgin island model in the original time coordinate  for example in a relation between @xmath73 and @xmath104  are referred to dawson and li ( 2003 )  @xcite . in that paper , a superprocess with dependent spatial motion and interactive immigration",
    "is constructed as the pathwise unique solution of a stochastic integral equation driven by a poisson point process whose intensity measure has as one component the excursion measure of the feller branching diffusion . in a special case ( see equation ( 1.6 ) in  @xcite with @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107}(a)\\,da$ ] ) , this is just the virgin island model with   replaced by a feller branching diffusion , i.e.  @xmath25 , @xmath108 , @xmath27 .",
