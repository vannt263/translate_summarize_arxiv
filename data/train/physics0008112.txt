    "a companion paper @xcite reviews magnetic bunch compression and shows a schematic of our system .",
    "i assume the reader is familiar with this paper .",
    "the aps bunch compressor design is an outgrowth of studies @xcite by p. emma and v. bharadwaj of stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) .",
    "they explored a number of designs , including symmetric and asymmetric four - dipole chicanes .",
    "starting from this work , i investigated a large number of configurations with various values of @xmath1 , asymmetry , and final current . for each configuration ,",
    "detailed longitudinal and transverse matching was performed , followed by tracking with csr and wakefields .",
    "then , sensitivity analysis was performed for all configurations , followed by jitter simulations for the least sensitive configurations .",
    "this work relied on elegant @xcite , a 6-d code with a fast simulation of csr effects , plus longitudinal and transverse wakefields .",
    "elegant also performs optimization of actual tracking results , such as bunch length , energy spread , and emittance .",
    "simulation of the linac uses the rfca element , a matrix - based rf cavity element with exact phase dependence .",
    "our linac has quadrupoles around the accelerating structures .",
    "hence , i split each 3-m section into about 20 pieces , between which are inserted thin - lens , 2nd - order quadrupole elements .",
    "a series of such elements is used for each quadrupole .",
    "a green s function technique is used to model wakefields , using a tabulation of the slac - structure wake functions provided by p. emma @xcite . to reduce running time ,",
    "one longitudinal wake element is used per 3-m section , which is a good approximation for relativistic particles . for transverse wakes ,",
    "i used one wake element per rf cavity element ( about 20 per section ) .    the csr model used by elegant",
    "is based on an equation @xcite for the energy change of an arbitrary line charge distribution as a function of the position in the bunch and in a bending magnet .",
    "details of this model will be presented by the author at an upcoming conference .",
    "effects of changes in the longitudinal distribution within a dipole are included .",
    "csr in drift spaces is included by propagating the terminal csr `` wake '' in each bend through the drifts with the beam .",
    "longitudinal and transverse matching has the goal of providing configurations for the 300-a and 600-a leutl operating points @xcite .",
    "the starting point for the simulations is macro particle data generated @xcite with parmela , giving the 6-d distribution after the photoinjector ( pi ) .",
    "see figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "longitudinal matching involves adjusting the phase and voltage of l2 ( see @xcite for nomenclature ) to obtain the desired current and energy after the chicane .",
    "then , l4 and l5 are adjusted to minimize the energy spread and obtain the desired final energy .",
    "longitudinal matching includes longitudinal wakefields , rf curvature , and higher - order effects in the beam transport , by matching _",
    "tracked _ properties of the simulated beam .",
    "figure [ fig : longitdist ] shows the longitudinal phase space for the 300-a case with @xmath2 mm , which exhibits a current spike of nearly 1200 a. the matching ignores this spike ( which is shorter than a slippage length for 530 nm ) because of the way `` current '' is defined @xcite .            following longitudinal matching , transverse matching",
    "is done for each configuration .",
    "initial twiss parameters are obtained from the rms properties of the parmela beam .",
    "starting values for the quadrupoles were obtained from matching `` by hand '' for one configuration .",
    "four sequential elegant runs work the beta functions down the linac .",
    "the most important constraints maintain small beta functions in the linac ( for transverse wakefield control ) , small horizontal beta in dipole b4 ( to reduce csr effects ) , and matching for the emittance measurement sections .",
    "figure [ fig : twiss ] shows sample twiss parameters in the chicane region .",
    "the matching is highly automated , so that only the desired beam current and energy needs to be specified .",
    "evaluation of tolerances and randomized simulations are also automated , being set up by scripts from the corresponding matching runs .",
    "transfer of data between simulation stages is handled using sdds files and scripts @xcite , reducing errors and increasing the number of configurations that can be examined .",
    "for example , a script is used to scan all configurations and give power supply specifications . a distributed queue",
    "utilizing 50 workstations is used to run the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : emittrends ] shows emittance vs. @xmath1 for the symmetric ( a=1 ) and asymmetric ( a=2 ) cases at 300 a and 600 a. for 300 a , the symmetric and asymmetric cases are very similar . for 600 a , the difference is 10% or more , which should be measurable .",
    "one surprise in figure [ fig : emittrends ] is that the emittance does not uniformly increase as @xmath3 increases , even though elegant shows the expected monotonic increase ( due to csr ) vs bending angle for a single dipole with a constant input beam distribution .",
    "this is apparently due to variation in the compressed bunch distribution between cases with the same `` current '' but different @xmath1 . for smaller @xmath3 ,",
    "there are higher current spikes at the head of the bunch , leading to a larger and more rapidly changing csr wake , which in turn leads to larger emittance growth .",
    "the effect is even more pronounced in the 1200-a cases ( not shown ) .",
    "insertion of the scraper between b2 and b3 to remove the low - energy part of the beam can reduce the height and width of the current spike , resulting in lower emittance .",
    "unfortunately , this also reduces the current in the rest of the bunch considerably .",
    "earlier simulations showed that emittance trends can be changed significantly by inconsistent values of the horizontal beta function at the exit of b4 .",
    "all of these subtleties will make for difficult interpretation of experiments in which @xmath1 is varied .",
    "however , because compression to different currents for fixed @xmath1 involves only adjustment of the rf phases and voltages , comparision of the emittance growth for different amounts of compression should be more straightforward .",
    "tolerances are driven by the fel gain length , trajectory , and wavelength stability requirements @xcite .",
    "the 10% rms gain length variation limit is easy to use in elegant as it computes fel performance directly using xie s parameterization @xcite .",
    "beam trajectory limits ( @xmath450 @xmath0 m , @xmath450@xmath0r ) are included separately as they are not incorporated into xie s formula .",
    "the 1-nm rms wavelength variation limit is a challenging goal at 530 nm as it puts a 0.1% limit on energy variation .",
    "the analysis begins by running single - parameter `` sweeps '' to assess the effect on the constrained quantities ( gain length , trajectory , and wavelength ) of accelerator parameters ( e.g. , rf phase ) .",
    "sweeps included rf phase and voltage ; photoinjector timing , charge , and energy ; and chicane dipole strength . from these sweeps ,",
    "a script determines the limit on each parameter change due to the various specifications , showing that configurations with the largest @xmath1 are least sensitive to difficult - to - control timing and phase errors .",
    "these configurations experience the most emittance degradation from csr , but tend to yield the shortest gain length as they have the smallest energy spread ( l2 being closer to crest ) .",
    ".selected sweep limits for @xmath2 mm [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the technical note @xcite by p. emma and v. bharadwaj provided a valuable starting point .",
    "i acknowledge helpful discussions and assistance from h. friedsam , e. lessner , j. lewellen , s. milton , and g. travish .",
    "j. lewellen provided the pi beam distribution data ."
