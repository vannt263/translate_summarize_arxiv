    "the solar wind is a ubiquitous super - alfvnic stream of magnetized charged particles from the sun , consisting of protons , electrons , and minor ions . according to spectroscopic observations of extreme ultraviolet emission lines in the inner corona ,",
    "solar wind ions exhibit a large kinetic temperature anisotropy , and minor ions are likely to be preferentially heated and accelerated @xcite . in the interplanetary space , minor ions have mass - proportional temperatures and similar bulk flow speed , whose drifting speeds relative to protons are at an order of local alfvn speed @xcite . and proton temperature in the direction parallel to the background interplanetary magnetic field is lower than that in the perpendicular direction .",
    "double components of tenuous fast beam and dense core frequently occur in the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) of protons , with a differential speed of 1.2  1.3 alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "the combination of these remote - sensing and interplanetary _ in - situ _ measurements substantiates that some energy should be continuously deposited into the solar wind ions _ via _ some physical mechanisms , and thus power the hot collisionless outflow from the sun .",
    "the solar wind has been an outstanding puzzle for its heating and acceleration since the theoretical prediction @xcite and observation verification @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the mechanical energy in the sun s internal convective motions must be converted into thermal energy above the photosphere .",
    "ion cyclotron waves are generally considered as a promising mechanism that can preferentially heat and accelerate minor ions .",
    "ion cyclotron frequencies in the extended corona vary from 10 to @xmath2 hz , whereas observed frequencies of pronounced oscillation on the solar surface are typically @xmath3 hz .",
    "how strong enough ion cyclotron waves could be generated is still debated . in terms of the origins of ion cyclotron waves , there are two main viewpoints of base and secondary generations .",
    "for the base generation , high - frequency alfvn waves are directly launched during small - scale magnetic reconnection of micro - flares in rapidly evolving super - granular networks , then propagate up through the corona , gradually reach cyclotron frequencies of various ions , and are finally damped over a very short distance @xcite . for the secondary generation ,",
    "high - frequency ion cyclotron waves are gradually converted from low - frequency alfvn waves in the corona , and such conversion process is probably from a direct turbulence cascade @xcite , local nonlinear kinetic instabilities @xcite , and debye - scale electron phase space holes in electron langmuir turbulence @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we assume that ( 1 ) the plasma turbulence cascade is the energy source of the solar wind and ( 2 ) the solar wind heating is due to landau and cyclotron resonances with a continuous turbulence spectrum .",
    "the solar wind turbulence is an ensemble of fluctuations with random phases and a broad range of wave vectors .",
    "such fluctuations are manifested in magnetic field @xmath4 , electric field @xmath5 , plasma bulk flow velocity @xmath6 , and so on .",
    "the fluctuation energy is usually transferred through a forward cascade .",
    "namely , the energy is injected from a preexisting population of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves at very low frequencies @xmath7 and wave numbers @xmath8 , nonlinearly transported through successively shorter wavelengths _ via _ wave - wave interaction , and eventually dissipated at ion kinetic scales _ via _ collisionless wave - particle interaction . the evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath9 in the presence of a background magnetic field @xmath10 can be represented in the elsasser variables @xmath11 as follows : @xmath12    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the alfvn speed , @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 is the pressure that is determined from the incompressibility condition of @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a large - scale forcing , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are parallel and perpendicular wave numbers , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is oscillation amplitude at the scale @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is imbalanced at a macro scale , as supported by nonzero cross - helicity in terms of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "there is more power in alfvnic fluctuations travelling away from the sun than towards it .",
    "even if balanced overall , mhd turbulence is always locally imbalanced in creating patches of positive and negative cross - helicities .",
    "the conservation of cross - helicity results in a hierarchical structure of mhd turbulence . in the corona , turbulence amplitude is constrained by interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) observations of electron density spectra @xcite .",
    "interplanetary _ in situ _ measurements of turbulence @xmath4 as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 have shown a power law spectrum of magnetic field fluctuation , and a large anisotropy in favor of quasi - perpendicular wave propagation @xcite : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 the solar wind turbulence in an inertial range of @xmath30 hz is similar to the classical kolmogorov picture of fluid turbulence , and the spectral index @xmath31 in equation ( [ equ : psd ] ) is approximately @xmath32 @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "the power spectral density is anisotropic with respect to @xmath10 , as indicated from @xmath33 in equation ( [ equ : psd1 ] ) and @xmath34 in equation ( [ equ : psd2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , within the inertial range , the elsasser variables @xmath24 were also found to be anisotropic and have two distinct scaling subranges @xcite .",
    "a transition between weak and strong turbulence regimes ( equation ( [ equ : weak - strong ] ) ) is feasible by changing a large - scale forcing @xmath18 ( equation ( [ equ : elsasser ] ) ) , as demonstrated from numerical simulation of anisotropic incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "the nature of the mhd turbulence cascade lies in the interaction of wave packets moving with alfvn velocities . in the framework of the weak turbulence scenario ,",
    "interacting wave packets are very large such that the original wave packets decay before they pass through each other . because the auto - correlation and cascade time scales are always of the same order of magnitude in the weak turbulence theory , any model that implies a large number of collisions among wave packets for an efficient energy cascade should belong to the strong turbulence theory @xcite . in the strong turbulence",
    ", interaction is strong , resonance conditions are not in force , hence a parallel cascade is possible @xcite .",
    "the forward cascade of @xmath4 could be modelled as a combination of advection and diffusion in the wave number @xmath35 space @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ equ : psd1 ] ) and ( [ equ : psd2 ] ) for turbulence anisotropy in the inertial range could be derived by a conjecture of dynamical alignment that polarizations of @xmath4 and @xmath9 tend to align during the turbulence cascade towards successively smaller scales @xcite . a good fraction of the power spectral density ( psd ) observations is well interpreted by the current turbulence theories .",
    "the turbulence in the dissipation range is poorly understood .",
    "spectral properties in the dissipation range almost certainly depend upon the details of the damping , though those in the inertial range are relatively robust and independent of detailed turbulence cascade processes .",
    "the observed wave number at a breakpoint , which separates the inertial and dissipation ranges , may scale as inverse proton inertial length @xmath36 @xcite or cyclotron radius @xmath37 @xcite , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 denoting proton plasma frequency , proton cyclotron frequency , and proton thermal speed respectively . above the inertial range",
    ", the psd has a distinct breakpoint at @xmath41 hz ; at higher frequencies of @xmath42 hz , the psd is steeper with a broader range of @xmath43 in equation ( [ equ : psd ] ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , found that a psd above the inertial range consists of two distinct regimes with successively larger values of @xmath31 in equation ( [ equ : psd ] ) ; @xmath31 is about 2.5 from 0.4 to 35 hz for a dispersion cascade and 4 from 35 to 100 hz due to strong wave damping .",
    "furthermore , it is still unclear what are the constituent wave modes of the solar wind turbulence .",
    "the macro - scale fluctuations in the solar wind and corona are alfvnic in nature @xcite . in the mhd regime",
    ", alfvn waves can be converted into fast waves by density fluctuations , and vice versa through resonant three - wave interaction @xcite . at the kinetic scale ,",
    "highly oblique whistler waves exist according to the observed properties of large magnetic compressibility in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "kinetic alfvn waves are identified from the observations of largely enhanced electric fluctuation spectrum and super - alfvnic wave phase speed at scales of ion thermal gyro - radius @xcite .",
    "parallel propagating alfvn - cyclotron waves are possibly present as evidenced by the measured angle distribution of magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "these observations have revealed the importance of quasi - perpendicularly propagating waves in the heating of the solar wind .",
    "increasing attention has been paid to oblique propagation owing to the natural occurrence of oblique waves from refractions in the inhomogeneous solar wind , production by density gradients , and generation from mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the alfvn - cyclotron wave branch , parallel propagation has its inherent difficulty to reconcile both the heating and the acceleration of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the nature of obliquely propagating waves is subject to debates @xcite .",
    "according to interplanetary measurements , these constituent waves may be kinetic alfvn waves @xcite or fast - whistler waves @xcite . in a warm plasma such as the interplanetary solar wind",
    ", oblique alfvn waves can generate a fast proton beam through landau resonance @xcite . in a cold proton / electron plasma ,",
    "quasi - perpendicular fast - whistler waves break up into bernstein modes near the first few harmonics of proton cyclotron frequency @xcite . due to the existence of minor ions in a solar corona - like plasma ,",
    "oblique fast - whistler waves are linearly coupled with hybrid cyclotron waves @xcite . depending on the abundance and relative speed with respect to protons",
    ", minor ions may change wave dispersion relation dramatically , induce a transition of wave polarization from right- to left - handed sense , and can absorb more energy from oblique fast - cyclotron waves than alfvn - cyclotron waves for intermediate angles @xmath44  @xmath45 of wave propagation @xcite . however , alfvn - cyclotron and fast - cyclotron waves in the inner corona have few empirical constraints for their exact properties such as generation mechanisms , propagation modes , and power levels",
    ". with favorable plasma parameters , both alfvn and fast waves can be potential candidates for preferential energization of minor ions in the solar wind .",
    "on the basis of current understanding , both fast - whistler and alfvn - cyclotron waves at both quasi - parallel and quasi - perpendicular propagation angles probably contribute to kinetic - scale turbulence in the solar wind @xcite .    in this paper , both alfvn and fast waves",
    "are investigated to explore their roles in energizing the low - beta multi - ion solar wind plasma in the inner corona . as a continuation to the work of , the linear mode conversion between fast - whistler and hybrid cyclotron waves is further quantified by a detailed parametric study of various plasma parameters .",
    "a quasi - linear theory of resonant wave - particle interaction @xcite is used , and we are able to study the parallel and perpendicular heating of solar wind species due to landau and cyclotron resonances .",
    "we give our model in section [ sec : method ] , and describe wave dispersion relations and accompanying electromagnetic field oscillations in section [ sec : dispersion ] .",
    "then the roles of wave propagation angle , minor ion presence , relative flow of minor ions , and plasma temperature are successively analyzed in sections [ sec : angle ] , [ sec : minor - ion ] , [ sec : dif - v ] , and [ sec : temperature ] .",
    "we discuss the ensuing nonlinear stage of wave - particle interaction in section [ sec : psd ] , and summarize our results in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to evaluate the energization effect of kinetic wave - particle interaction on the multi - species solar wind , two methods are sequentially combined in this paper .",
    "first , using linear vlasov theory @xcite , the properties of alfvn and fast waves such as their dispersion relations and electromagnetic polarizations are studied .",
    "second , using a quasi - linear theory of resonant wave - particle interaction @xcite , the previously derived wave properties are adopted to calculate the acceleration and heating rates of different plasma species . with the two - step approach , the wave - particle interaction can be quantified to demonstrate the most viable and efficient way for the solar wind energization .",

    "this wave - particle interaction was formulated into a kinetic shell model @xcite , which quantitatively describes ion energization by bidirectionally propagating ion cyclotron waves . as a result ,",
    "the vdf in equation ( [ equ : vdf ] ) is gradually deviated from its initially maxwellian distribution .",
    "the quasi - linear coefficients of equation ( [ equ : marsch ] ) are only valid in a small deviation from the maxwellian vdf of particles ( equation ( [ equ : vdf ] ) ) and a small damping rate of plasma waves ( equation ( [ equ : gary - threshold ] ) ) .",
    "owing to these limitations , the analytical method in this paper can only describe the initial quasi - linear stage of wave - particle interaction .",
    "the ensuing nonlinear stage is beyond the scope of this paper , though it can be self - consistently described by full particle simulation .",
    "using the linear vlasov wave theory and quasi - linear resonant wave - particle interaction for a low - beta multi - species plasma @xcite , fast and alfvn waves ( and their dispersion relations and electromagnetic field fluctuations ) are analyzed , and then applied to energize a proton / electron / alpha plasma with a low proton beta of @xmath207 . in this paper , we assume that ( 1 ) low - frequency alfvn and fast waves are launched from the solar surface with the same spectral shape and the same amplitude of psd , ( 2 ) these macro - scale waves / turbulences continuously cascade towards kinetic scales at ion cyclotron frequencies and ion inertial scales , and ( 3 ) the transported kinetic - scale waves energize solar wind species through cyclotron and landau resonances . if the wave propagation angle @xmath0 is oblique with respect to the background magnetic field , fast - whistler waves can be linearly coupled with hybrid alpha - proton cyclotron waves .",
    "both fast - cyclotron and alfvn - cyclotron waves are important for preferential heating and acceleration of minor ions . in this paper",
    ", noticeable energization of alpha particles requires oblique propagation for fast - cyclotron waves ( @xmath115 ) and non - perpendicular propagation for alfvn - cyclotron waves ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "nearly perpendicular alfvn - cyclotron waves at @xmath209 significantly degenerate their capabilities of energizing minor ions due to very large perpendicular wave numbers at ion cyclotron frequencies . only through complex nonlinear processes , nearly perpendicular alfvn waves may heat ions . for instance , proposed that the damping of kinetic alfvn waves successively leads to electron beams , langmuir turbulence , and debye - scale electron phase space holes , and ions are perpendicularly heated _ via _ a collision - like scenario .",
    "meanwhile , oblique fast - cyclotron waves have a larger left - handedly polarized electric field @xmath210 than the corresponding alfvn - cyclotron waves , because the total electric field fluctuation @xmath138 of fast waves is stronger enough to over - compensate its smaller ratio of left- to right - handedly polarized electric fields @xmath211",
    ". moreover , in contrast to alfvn - cyclotron waves , alpha cyclotron resonance happens at a smaller wave number for fast - cyclotron waves especially at @xmath212 , where the turbulence psd has a larger local amplitude .",
    "hence , fast - cyclotron waves have a greater capability of energizing solar wind ions than alfvn - cyclotron waves . interacting with alfvn - cyclotron and fast - cyclotron waves , alpha particles",
    "are preferentially energized as the primary recipient of wave energy .",
    "in contrast to alpha particles , electrons are generally less energized . when the differential speed @xmath183 of alpha particles is high enough , alfvn - cyclotron waves lose alpha cyclotron resonance much earlier than fast - cyclotron waves .",
    "for example , at @xmath213 , alpha cyclotron resonance disappears at @xmath214 for alfvn - cyclotron waves and @xmath215 for fast - cyclotron waves .",
    "when alpha particles lose cyclotron resonance , fast - cyclotron waves restore to fast - whistler waves without linear mode conversion , and alfvn - cyclotron waves begin to mainly energize protons .",
    "moreover , an extremely fast beam and/or a high temperature anisotropy of minor ions could release their excessive kinetic energy to excite ion cyclotron waves .",
    "therefore both fast and alfvn waves are likely to contribute to the eventually sustainable and balanced differential speed and temperature anisotropy of minor ions in the solar wind .    linear mode conversion between fast - whistler and hybrid cyclotron waves due to the presence of minor ions could be an efficient mechanism to dissipate wave energy into minor ions . in a warm plasma in the interplanetary space ,",
    "such mode coupling vanishes , and parallel electron heating by landau damping of oblique fast - whistler waves becomes non - negligible .",
    "as demonstrated in this paper and the previous work of , fast - cyclotron waves besides alfvn - cyclotron waves could also be considered as a promising candidate for preferential heating and acceleration of minor ions in the inner corona . since fast and alfvn waves heat the solar wind ions in very different ways , it is important to know the exact nature of plasma turbulence at kinetic scales . in this",
