    "in this paper we present experimental data for and a theoretical analysis of the decay rates of fluctuations in a fluid layer between two horizontal plates that are maintained at two different temperatures .",
    "the size @xmath0 of the layer in the horizontal directions is much larger than the distance @xmath1 between the plates .",
    "by now it has been well established that the presence of a uniform and stationary temperature gradient @xmath2 in the fluid layer induces hydrodynamic fluctuations that are long ranged in space .",
    "an important dimensionless parameter that governs the nature of the thermal nonequilibrium fluctuations is the rayleigh number @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravitational acceleration and where @xmath5 is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath6 the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath7 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid . the rayleigh number is commonly taken to be positive when the fluid layer is heated from below .",
    "states in which the fluid layer is heated from above then correspond to @xmath8 .",
    "the fluid layer in the presence of a temperature gradient remains in a quiescent state for all @xmath9 less than a critical value @xmath10 for the onset of rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection , including all negative values of @xmath9 .",
    "the present paper is concerned with thermal fluctuations in such a fluid layer for positive values of @xmath9 below @xmath10 .    at sufficiently large wave numbers",
    "@xmath11 the intensity of nonequilibrium fluctuations is proportional to @xmath12 both for negative and positive @xmath9  @xcite . for smaller values of @xmath11",
    "it was shown theoretically  @xcite and confirmed experimentally  @xcite that the increase of the fluctuation intensity with decreasing @xmath11 is quenched in the presence of gravity , yielding a constant value in the limit of small @xmath11 .",
    "if the presence of top and bottom boundaries is taken into account , one finds that the intensity of the fluctuations vanishes as @xmath13  @xcite at small @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the nonequilibrium structure factor @xmath14 is predicted to exhibit a crossover from a @xmath15 dependence for larger @xmath11 to a @xmath13 dependence in the limit @xmath16 , leading to a maximum at an intermediate wave number @xmath17 which has a value near @xmath18 . as the rb instability is approached from below",
    ", linear theory predicts that @xmath19 , as well as the total fluctuation power [ _ i.e. _ , the integral of @xmath14 ] diverges , in agreement with the asymptotic prediction obtained by zaitsev and shliomis  @xcite and by swift and hohenberg  @xcite .",
    "the predicted increase as the rb instability is approached was verified quantitatively by experiments using shadowgraph measurements  @xcite .",
    "as the fluctuations become large it was predicted  @xcite and confirmed experimentally  @xcite that linear theory breaks down and that the fluctuation amplitudes saturate due to nonlinear interactions .",
    "the present paper is concerned not with the intensity , but with the dynamics of the nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "one experimental technique to probe the time dependence of the fluctuations is provided by dynamic rayleigh light scattering .",
    "dynamic light scattering experiments in fluid layers with negative rayleigh numbers have shown the existence of two modes : a heat mode with a decay rate equal to @xmath21 associated with temperature fluctuations , and a viscous mode with a decay rate equal to @xmath22 associated with transverse momentum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "thus , for large @xmath11 where gravity and boundary effects are negligible the coupling between the heat mode and the viscous mode causes an enhancement of the amplitude of nonequilibrium fluctuations , but does not affect the decay rates , in accordance with the original predictions of kirkpatrick _ et al_.  @xcite",
    ". however , for smaller @xmath11 ( corresponding to macroscopic wavelengths ) , gravity and boundary effects induce a coupling between the decay rates of the viscous and heat modes , as originally suggested by lekkerkerker and boon  @xcite . for certain negative values of the rayleigh number the modes can even become propagating  @xcite . on the other hand , for positive @xmath9 near the rb instability",
    "the nonequilibrium structure factor is dominated by a very slow mode with a decay rate which vanishes as @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of critical slowing down of the fluctuations as the rb instability is approached from below has been observed experimentally , but the results obtained so far are qualitative . using forced rayleigh scattering allain _",
    "et al_.  @xcite measured the decay of imposed horizontal spatially periodic temperature profiles with various wave numbers @xmath11 .",
    "the decay time of these imposed deviations from the steady state increased as the temperature gradient approached the value associated with @xmath10 . furthermore , the decay times became larger for periodic temperature profiles with @xmath11 closer to @xmath24 .",
    "critical slowing down of nonequilibrium fluctuations has also been observed by sawada with an acoustic method  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "first a deterministic rb pattern was established and then the cell was turned over so as to change the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "the experimental observations were interpreted with an amplitude equation that did not include any wave - number dependence .",
    "the single decay time extracted from the data did indeed increase as the onset of convection was approached , but numerical agreement with the amplitude equation was poor . using neutron scattering , riste and coworkers",
    "@xcite observed the critical slowing down of nonequilibrium fluctuations close to the onset of convection in a liquid crystal .",
    "quantitative experimental studies have been performed showing the slowing down of the dynamics of deterministic patterns as the rb instability is approached from _ above _",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we present a quantitative theoretical and experimental study of the decay rates of fluctuations for positive @xmath9 but below the rb instability .",
    "the results of both experiment and theory reveal the critical slowing down as the rb instability is approached from below .",
    "theoretically , the decay rates can be determined , in principle , from a linear stability analysis of the deterministic oberbeck - boussinesq ( ob ) equations against perturbations , as has been done traditionally  @xcite .",
    "however , here we derive these decay rates by solving the linearized stochastic ob equations , obtained by supplementing the deterministic ob equations with random dissipative fluxes  @xcite . because of onsager s regression hypothesis , the two procedures should yield the same result , and indeed they do .",
    "however , it is important to note that a solution of the stochastic ob equations is required to obtain the correct amplitudes of the nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "for instance , it turns out that the wave number @xmath17 corresponding to the maximum enhancement of the intensity of the fluctuations as a function of @xmath11 differs , at least for @xmath25 , from the value of @xmath11 at which the decay rate has a minimum  @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper the results of experimental shadowgraph measurements  @xcite of the fluctuations in a thin horizontal layer of sulfur hexafluoride heated from below but with @xmath25 .",
    "we show that the decay rates of the fluctuations can be obtained from an analysis of images acquired at various exposure times , and compare the experimental results with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the data as well as the theory reveal the critical slowing down of the fluctuations as the onset of convection is approached .",
    "to our knowledge , previous shadowgraph experiments were used primarily to obtain the fluctuation intensities  @xcite .",
    "exceptions are studies of the dynamics of deterministic patterns above the rb instability that used image sequences at constant time intervals  @xcite",

    "as was done previously  @xcite , we determine the nonequilibrium structure factor by solving the linearized stochastic ob equations for the temperature and velocity fluctuations .",
    "it should be noted that the use of the linearized ob equations implies that the critical slowing down of the fluctuations near the rb instability is treated in a mean - field approximation in which the decay rate will vanish at @xmath28 when the wave number @xmath11 equals a critical wave number @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "it is known from theory  @xcite and experiment  @xcite that nonlinear effects will cause a saturation of the fluctuating amplitudes when they become very large .",
    "the effect of nonlinear terms on the decay rates depends on the nature of the bifurcation in the presence of fluctuations . in the rb case",
    "the fluctuations change the bifurcation , which is supercritical in the absence of fluctuations  @xcite , to subcritical  @xcite . in that case",
    "one would expect the decay rates to remain finite at the bifurcation ; however , this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper .    for the case of a fluid layer between two plates with stress - free ( _ i.e_. , slip ) boundary conditions the intensity and the decay rates of the nonequilibrium fluctuations have been obtained in a previous publication  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of stress - free boundary conditions is that they permit an exact analytic solution of the problem . here ,",
    "instead , we consider the more realistic case of a fluid layer between two rigid boundaries , corresponding to two perfectly conducting walls for the temperature and with no - slip boundary conditions for the local fluid velocity .",
    "while this case does not permit an exact analytic solution , a good approximation can be obtained by representing the dependence of the temperature and velocity fluctuations upon the vertical @xmath29 coordinate by galerkin polynomials  @xcite .",
    "specifically , two of us have determined the static nonequilibrium structure factor in a first - order galerkin approximation  @xcite .",
    "a first - order galerkin - polynomial solution appears to provide a good approximation below the convection threshold for the total intensity of the fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "the advantage of the galerkin approximation is that one can specify the decay rates @xmath32 explicitly as a function of @xmath43 .",
