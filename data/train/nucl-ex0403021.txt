    "measurements on @xmath0 colliding systems at rhic provide a crucial baseline measurement with which to compare measurements from au+au collisions .",
    "these comparisons offer a means to distinguish nuclear medium effects from what might be expected in a superposition of @xmath4 nucleon+nucleon collisions .",
    "however , @xmath0 systems are interesting in their own right .",
    "previous measurements have shown a systematic dependence of the @xmath1 on particle mass as well as event multiplicity .",
    "measurements from ua1@xcite of the @xmath1 of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and charged hadrons as a function of the @xmath7 from @xmath8 collisions at @xmath2=630 gev show a clear increasing trend with @xmath7 and this trend is stronger for the @xmath5 than for the @xmath6 or the pion - dominated charged inclusives .    lower energy isr data ( @xmath923 gev  63 gev)@xcite",
    "seem to also show a mass dependence for @xmath1 which has been parameterized@xcite with the form @xmath10 .",
    "an increase in the @xmath1 with particle mass should also be reflected in the inverse - slope parameter .",
    "model calculations that include the effects of  mini - jets \" ( multi - parton interactions ) show such a dependence of the inverse - slope parameter on particle mass@xcite while hydro calculations show only a weak dependence on mass at best",
    ".    identified particle spectra ( @xmath11 , k@xmath12 , p & @xmath13 ) at isr energies have been successfully described@xcite by a  universal \" parameterization of the form shown in equation [ equ : univ ]    @xmath14    where @xmath3 is the transverse mass ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is known as @xmath3scaling and would seem to suggest that over a given range of @xmath3 , spectra of particles with different masses would have similar slopes .",
    "also , even if the spectra have no relative scaling factors applied , the yields will be similar at a given @xmath3 .",
    "it has been suggested that in au+au collisions at sufficiently high energy the parton density increases to the point of saturation , forming a state referred to as the  color glass condensate \" ( cgc)@xcite . the intrinsic momentum scale of the cgc allows a single function to describe produced particle spectra over a range of energy , centrality , and system size .",
    "this idea has been tested on data from @xmath0 at the cern sps and , more recently , on minimum bias @xmath16 gev au+au data from the phenix collaboration at rhic@xcite .",
    "star is a multi - system experiment the heart of which is the large volume time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the tpc provides excellent tracking of charged particles with good momentum resolution (  2 - 7% for @xmath17 s out to a @xmath18 of  4 gev/@xmath19 ) over a broad rapidity window (  1.8 units in @xmath20 ) .",
    "particle identification is done via @xmath21 and , more recently , with a time of flight ( tof ) system@xcite .",
    "the full details of the star experiment subsystems are available elsewhere@xcite .",
    "identification of strange particle decays in star is done via a topological algorithm in which several geometrical cuts are applied to the charged particle tracks . once identification is done and the parent momenta determined , the resulting spectra must be corrected for finite detector acceptance and efficiency . for this",
    "we use a technique known as  embedding \" .    in embedding , monte - carlo generated tracks are propagated through a full geant@xcite simulation of the star detector response and then added at the pixel level to signals from real data events . the embedded event is then processed with our standard event reconstruction software and a search is made to see if the embedded particle s track is reconstructed . in this way we obtain correction factors which account for both efficiency and acceptance losses , as a function of @xmath18 , in a single procedure .",
    "star has measured the transverse momentum spectra for particles with masses up to and including the @xmath22 baryon in @xmath0 systems with @xmath23 gev .",
    "present statistics are insufficient for an @xmath24 spectrum in @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath18 ranges of the measured spectra depend on the particle species due to the differing means of particle identification .",
    "pion , kaon , and proton spectra from the tpc have the greatest precision at low @xmath18 but are the most limited in extent ( out to @xmath251 gev/@xmath19 in total momentum ) due to the overlapping of the bethe - bloch bands .",
    "the tof increases the upper limit to about 3 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "strange particles decays can be reconstructed over a wide range of transverse momentum @xmath26 but are limited by the available statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : ppxi ] shows the mid - rapidity @xmath18 spectra for @xmath27 and anti-@xmath27 baryons .     and",
    "@xmath28 from @xmath0 at @xmath23 gev , @xmath29 .",
    "error bars are statistical only , width=245 ]    the fits are exponentials in @xmath3 of the form :    @xmath30    which describes the data reasonably well at low @xmath18 .",
    "but we already begin to see the deviation of the power - law - like tail above @xmath254 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "while the statistics do not allow binning in event multiplicity for the @xmath27 s , the situation is quite different for the @xmath6 and @xmath5@xcite .      from the fits to the @xmath18 spectra",
    "we may determine the @xmath1 in each multiplicity bin .",
    "the results of this determination can be seen in the figure [ fig : lamk0meanpt ] below .",
    "note the suppressed zero on the vertical scale .     and",
    "@xmath31 on uncorrected @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "error bars are statistical only.,width=245 ]    both species show a clear rising trend with uncorrected @xmath32 , though the trend seems to be slightly stronger for the @xmath5 s .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath5 production seems to be biased more toward the harder collisions that are indicated by the higher uncorrected @xmath32 .",
    "we present in the figure [ fig : meanptvsmass ] the trend of the @xmath1 with particle mass for the 200 gev @xmath0 and central au+au systems .",
    "vs. particle mass for @xmath0 at @xmath23 gev and au+au at @xmath34 gev.,width=245 ]    the black line is from the @xmath10 parameterization of the isr data which included masses only up to the @xmath5 .",
    "the difference between the au+au and @xmath0 @xmath1 for each particle is believed to be due mostly to the presence of radial flow@xcite in the au+au system . this effect is weaker for the more massive particles .",
    "although the isr parameterization works well for the lower mass particles despite the large difference in beam energy , the deviations become significant for the higher masses where the increase in @xmath1 is nearly linear with mass .",
    "figure [ fig : ppnoscale ] shows the spectra with no scaling factors applied .",
    "the difference in yields at any given @xmath3 shows that @xmath3scaling does not work in the absolute sense and can only be approximate at best for our @xmath0 data .",
    "taking the @xmath3 spectra for the various species from the @xmath0 and scaling them by arbitrary factors it seems likely that they would be describable by a single function .",
    "gev @xmath0 collisions with no relative scaling factors applied .",
    "error bars are statistical only.,width=245 ]    the spectra in figure [ fig : pplowptscaled ] have been scaled by arbitrary factors to achieve the best overlap and were fit with a power law of the form : @xmath35^n } \\label{equ : pwrlaw}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : ppmtratio ] is the point - by - point ratio of the data to the fit .",
    "the fit is good to within 20% out to almost 3 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "adding in the data from the tof as well as the @xmath6 data , but retaining the fit to the spectra from figure [ fig : pplowptscaled ] we see in figure [ fig : ratiowithtof ] that the meson spectra trend away from the apparent curve established by the previous fit .",
    "the trend becomes apparent due to the extended @xmath18 range availible in the tof and @xmath6 spectra .",
    "gev @xmath0 collisions including time - of - flight and @xmath6 .",
    "the tof spectra provide a greater range in @xmath18 than those from @xmath21 alone .",
    "error bars are statistical only.,width=245 ]    the onset of deviation from the original fit at @xmath361 gev/@xmath19 is interesting in that the hard scatterings are beginning to become an important contribution to the spectra in this region . the baryons seem to maintain agreement further out in @xmath3 and the delayed departure of the pions could be due to contributions feeding - down from higher mass decays .",
    "when scaling factors are applied to the au+au @xmath3 spectra no absolute scaling is evident and only very little overlap can be achieved .",
    "figure [ fig : scaledauau ] shows the scaled au+au spectra .",
    "gev au+au collisions .",
    "error bars are statistical only.,width=245 ]    deviations from the universal fit in @xmath0 and au+au are very different in nature . in au+au the likely presence of radial flow changes the spectral shapes at low-@xmath3 eliminating the universal curve that was present in the @xmath0 spectra .",
    "the au+au spectra are also different in shape , being flatter than those from p+p .",
    "we have presented preliminary results from analyses of the @xmath18 spectra of @xmath11 , @xmath37 , p , @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath27 from @xmath23 gev @xmath0 collisions and @xmath11 , @xmath37 , p , @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath27 , and @xmath38 from @xmath34 gev au+au collisions measured by the star collaboration at rhic .",
    "the measured @xmath1 for @xmath6 and @xmath5 show a clear dependence on the uncorrected average charged particle multiplicity per unit @xmath20 in the @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the dependence is slightly stronger for the @xmath39 than for the @xmath31 , while production of both species seems to be more probable in the harder , higher multiplicity collisions .",
    "the mass dependence of the @xmath1 agrees well with the @xmath10 parameterization of the lower energy isr results for masses up to about the @xmath40 mass .",
    "again , it should be noted that the isr measurements only included masses below the @xmath5 .",
    "the strong trend of the @xmath1 with particle mass could be an indication of the increasing importance of the mini - jet contribution to the @xmath18 spectra at rhic energies as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the transverse mass spectra from the @xmath0 collisions are seen to obey an approximate @xmath3scaling in the low @xmath18 region but the greater range of the tof spectra show the scaling breaks down above @xmath251 gev in @xmath3 for mesons but seems to hold slightly further out in @xmath18 for baryons .",
    "the au+au data show a different behavior from the @xmath0 in that the radial flow , which is believed to be present in the au+au system , depletes the low-@xmath18 region producing a flatter , hotter spectrum .",
    "the low-@xmath18 region then can not be used for the scaling normalization , in effect breaking the approximate scaling observed in @xmath0 .",
