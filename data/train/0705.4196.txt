    "in the past two decades , observations enabled by new technology have substantially broadened our understanding of dust surrounding main - sequence stars . these tenuous disks of dust , found around nearby stars , are fundamentally linked to the processes of star and planet formation  .",
    "current scenarios favor casting `` debris disks '' in the later stages of the systems formation , after most of the primordial gas and dust have dissipated  ( on timescales of 110myr ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the debris is freshly nourished by the sublimation , evaporation , and collisional destruction of orbiting parent bodies  ( for a recent review , cf .",
    "* ) . since a portion of these parent bodies may take part in the accretion of cores into planets",
    " which may in turn gravitationally perturb the dust  circumstellar debris disks offer evidence for the presence of planets and insight into their formation .",
    "debris disks are usually discovered by sensing the thermal re - radiation of absorbed starlight in the far ir  .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these systems , particularly the range from the ir to the sub - mm , are commonly used to infer the ( often cold ) dust temperature and extent of disk inner clearing  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the absence of additional information , significant degeneracies exist in modeling the dust disks with seds  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "severe ambiguities between disk morphology and the grains physical characteristics are removed with spatially resolved images of the thermal and scattered light ; however , the faintness of the dust and often - large dynamic range between the star and disk present significant obstacles to their acquisition . resolved images are both rare and valuable .    images at multiple wavelengths are yet more powerful .",
    "spatially resolving the debris across several wavebands provides definitive evidence for the size , space , and compositional distributions of the grains  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "coupling such data with detailed models of grain dynamics can expose the fundamental physical phenomena governing the production and diffusion of dust throughout the disk .",
    "physical models trace the characteristics of grains ( i.e. composition and geometry ) to the underlying parent body distribution , which in turn enables inferences regarding the coagulation history of solid material .",
    "these parent bodies may be corralled into a specific architecture through the gravity of nearby planets .",
    "moreover , planets can imprint their signatures on the dust disk itself  .",
    "tracing the mechanisms of grain dynamics through resolved imaging also addresses crucial questions about the nature of dust production in these systems  is the dust distribution steady - state , or is the evolution of debris governed by transient events , such as rare collisions between massive bodies or extrasolar analogs to the late heavy bombardment ?",
    "again , the images that are critical to addressing these issues are rare , though the number of resolved systems has increased rapidly in the past few years ( for recent tabulations , see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "with ever - increasing sample sizes , we have entered an era where we can compare the structure and evolution of circumstellar dust with quantities which shape the paths of planet formation , such as stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "contemporary work has revealed an exciting laboratory for the detailed study of circumstellar debris .",
    "( gj803 ) is a nearby star that harbors an optically thin debris disk .",
    "the spectral type in the literature ranges from dm02.5ve  .",
    "it is a member of the moving group , and as such is one of the youngest  ( @xmath4myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and among the closest  ( 9.94@xmath50.13pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the known resolved debris disks .",
    "it is especially attractive to study in the larger context of disk evolution as a function of stellar mass . in terms of mass ,",
    "m dwarfs like au  mic  constitute the dominant stellar component of the galaxy . despite the abundance of such stars ,",
    "au  mic  is currently unique among the resolved debris systems .",
    "it is a touchstone for studying the evolution of circumstellar disks around low - mass stars .",
    "au  mic  has a well - chronicled history of flare activity  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that strong stellar activity has a significant effect on dust dynamics and lifetimes  @xcite .",
    "notably , we can make direct comparisons across spectral types given au  mic  and its sibling @xmath0  pic , the archetypal a star with an edge - on debris disk .",
    "the scattered light of the dust around au  mic  was discovered by  @xcite , who used seeing - limited _",
    "r_-band coronagraphic imaging to resolve it into an extended , near - edge - on disk .",
    "additional high - resolution studies followed , with adaptive optics ( ao ) observations at _ h_-band by  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter  ) .",
    "these detailed images reveal a very thin midplane ( fwhm@xmath22au ) with an inner disk closely aligned with the line of sight  .",
    "the midplane surface brightness profiles show a break around 3545au , with brightness decreasing more sharply at larger projected distances .",
    "there are slight asymmetries in the overall brightness of the profiles between the two disk ansae .",
    "further , the midplane exhibits substructure on smaller scales , including localized enhancements and deficits in brightness , and vertical deviations of midplane positions away from that of a uniform disk .",
    "comparison of these structures between datasets is required to confidently reject image processing artifacts .",
    "the origin of the small - scale structure remains unexplained .",
    "a striking feature of the scattered light disk is its color",
    ". found a blue color in the visible with _ hst _ , along with an apparent color gradient  the disk is increasingly blue from 3060au .",
    "the disk is also blue from the visible to the _ h _  band , as noted by  .",
    "this is unlike many of the disks resolved to date , which are neutral or red scatterers like @xmath0  pic  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that two other recently imaged disks , hd32297  @xcite and hd15115  @xcite , also scatter blue between the optical and near - ir .",
    "such data are important because images at each new wavelength serve to further constrain the sizes , composition , and structure of grains through analysis of their scattering properties .",
    "while the scattered light imaging of the disk has attracted attention in the past few years , there has also been significant study of the grains thermal emission in the sed .",
    "the cold dust around au  mic  was first identified by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) , as excess emission at 60  was weakly detected  .",
    "recently , sensitive measurements of the 850  flux confirmed the presence of cold dust around the star  @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ has further constrained the thermal emission of the dust in the mid - ir  @xcite .",
    "results of these studies have been taken as indirect evidence for the presence of planets around the star .",
    "the gravitational influence of such planets provides a possible mechanism for generating the substructure in the disk . in particular",
    ", mean - motion resonances from a planet can trap dust to produce radial , azimuthal , and vertical structure  , though to date , no models of these mechanisms have been applied to the substructure of au  mic .",
    "further , the shallow surface brightness profiles in the inner disk and lack of thermal excess in the 1020  region of the sed have suggested an inner clearing of dust , perhaps maintained again by the presence of an inner planet  .",
    "nonetheless , it is imperative to understand the detailed physics affecting the distribution of dust grains around this disk prior to establishing the presence of unseen planets .",
    "the gravity of such perturbers is just one of many effects which may shape the dust distribution , including grain - grain collisions , forces from both stellar radiation and wind , and gas drag . because the disk is along the line - of - sight to the star , au  mic  is a favorable target for using absorption spectroscopy to search for remnant gas in the disk .",
    "@xcite placed limits on the column of h@xmath6 toward the star using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) , concluding that giant planets were unlikely to have formed given the rapid dissipation of primordial gas .",
    "different groups have placed planet detection limits around the star in very narrow  ( @xmath7@xmath820au ; * ? ? ? * ) and slightly wider fields  ( @xcite ;  ) , and to date none have been directly detected .",
    "certainly the question of planets in this system warrants further study , as these different lines of evidence have not been resolved .",
    "comprehending the physics that sculpt the dust distribution in this debris disk remains a key step for not only determining the existence of planets , but also for informing us about the evolution of solid material around stars in general . and",
    "have both investigated the observed break in the midplane surface brightness profile and color gradient in the outer disk , and hypothesize that a ring of parent bodies ( near the break in surface brightness profile ) acts as a source of dust grains , which are subsequently swept outward by a strong stellar wind .",
    "provide a detailed physical model for au  mic  for this scenario .",
    "the steady - state spatial and size distributions of dust grains are determined by a small set of physical processes ( e.g. collisions , radiation , wind , etc . ) , and with other assumptions about grain properties , the model can reproduce observations of scattered light profiles and the sed .",
    "as illustrated by the work done to date , we have constraints on the distribution of dust using scattered light images coupled with the sed .",
    "however , in this edge - on system , a degeneracy remains between the scattering properties of grains and their supposed spatial distribution .",
    "the advantage of measurements in polarized light , rather than total intensity , is that they give complementary information in the grain scattering properties ( for grain sizes @xmath9 such that @xmath10 ) and thus reduce this degeneracy .",
    "the polarization properties of au  mic s disk have recently been measured with _ hst_/acs by  @xcite .",
    "the disk exhibits strong gradients in linear polarization , and their modeling of the flux of polarized visible light indicates the presence of small porous grains and an architecture consistent with a significant ( @xmath11300:1 in vertical optical depth to scattering ) inner clearing .    in this paper , we report and analyze multiband ao observations of the scattered light disk of au  mic  in the near ir .",
    "our high - contrast images were processed with a novel data reduction technique which aims to mitigate the effects of point - spread function variability on ground - based observations .",
    "we report on the observed colors and color gradients of the disk brightness profiles for our images , and also for reprocessed _ hst _",
    "data previously presented by  .",
    "guided by the recent characterization of grain scattering properties by  @xcite , we simultaneously fit a dust model to near ir and visible scattered light data as well as the sed . with this model of dust distribution",
    ", we then check the consistency of  s physical model for the disk architecture with our empirical results .",
    "we examine the question of whether the inner disk is populated , as expected if corpuscular drag forces can draw grains inward before they are pulverized through collisions .",
    "we document our observational and data reduction techniques in   [ sec : obs&reduc ] ; we present our observational results in   [ sec : results ] and analyze dust models in   [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in   [ sec : discn&concl ] .",
    "the achievable spatial resolution is a prime motivator for imaging debris disks in the optical and near infrared  resolved images here highlight structural details and dust properties .",
    "however , at these wavelengths the star overwhelms the light scattered by the circumstellar debris .",
    "this contrast ratio characterizes a fundamental observational challenge in such studies of debris systems .",
    "to meet this challenge , we use ao to concentrate the star s light and employ a coronagraph to occult the resulting stellar image , thereby increasing sensitivity to the disk . here , we detail our use of ao coronagraphy and image processing techniques to study the circumstellar dust  (  [ subsec : nir_im][subsec : psf_sub ] ) .",
    "we describe calibration of the ao data in   [ subsec : calibration ] , and our use of _ hst _ images in   [ subsec : hst_data ] .",
    "we observed au  mic  on the nights of 2004 aug 29 - 30 with the keck ii ao system and a coronagraphic imaging mode of the nirc2 camera . au  mic  is sufficiently bright to serve as its own reference for adaptive wavefront correction .",
    "after wavefront compensation , the on - axis starlight is blocked by a focal - plane mask .",
    "diffraction effects are then suppressed by a pupil - plane lyot stop , and the light is reimaged onto a 1024@xmath121024pixel aladdin detector .",
    "the narrow - field mode of the camera was used , at a scale of @xmath810mas  pixel@xmath13 .",
    "exposure times were 3060s in _",
    "j__h___k__@xmath1  ( 60@xmath121s in _ _",
    "l__@xmath1 ) , and the filter was cycled after a few short exposures in each band .",
    "exposures where the disk was aligned with a diffraction spike were discarded .",
    "the filters , total integration times , and focal masks are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we used a 05 radius focal plane mask on the second night , however the data in the region around the edge of this mask were discarded due to large residual subtraction errors .",
    "calibration employed standard bias subtraction and flat fielding techniques .",
    "imaging faint circumstellar material requires suppression of the stellar light , whose distribution is given by the on - axis point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "while the coronagraph suppresses much of the starlight , a fraction leaks through the system and must be subtracted from the data in post - processing .",
    "the relative success of this operation is linked to psf stability . in observations through an altitude - azimuth telescope like keck , the image plane rotates relative to the telescope with parallactic angle .",
    "however , features in the psf that are produced by the telescope ( e.g. diffraction spikes ) maintain a fixed orientation relative to it .",
    "we disabled the instrument rotator of nirc2 to additionally fix the orientation of any features arising from camera aberrations . with the disabled rotator ,",
    "the psf orientation is fixed relative to the detector while the edge - on disk appears to rotate around the stellar image with time .",
    "this allows us to disentangle the image of the disk from features in the diffraction pattern of the star , as well as use the stable orientation of the stellar psf on the detector for more accurate subtraction .",
    "`` roll subtraction '' is a general observational methodology that has been applied with success to ao imaging of circumstellar disks  .",
    "an account of our version of the roll subtraction technique follows .",
    "the time variability of the ao psf is often the limiting factor in detecting faint circumstellar material from the ground . rather than subtracting the stellar psf from non - contemporaneous observations of reference stars ,",
    "we wish to directly exploit information from the science target exposures .",
    "techniques developed by  @xcite and  @xcite seek to model the ao system to estimate the psf , using telemetry data and crowded field imaging , respectively .",
    "however , these techniques do not yet have demonstrated applicability to high - contrast imaging . for roll subtraction , mitigation of ao psf variability can potentially improve contrast .",
    "we note in particular the technique s advancement in this regard by  @xcite for the case of point source detection .",
    "we developed an algorithm suited to the self - subtraction of time - varying ao psfs and applied it to the reduction of our near - ir images .",
    "in essence , because the psf remains in a fixed orientation while the edge - on disk rotates , one may use psf information spanning several exposures to estimate the stellar psf ( effectively removing the disk ) .",
    "our refinement to the procedure is to estimate the psf for each exposure , rather than for the ensemble .",
    "the psf estimates are then used to subtract the stellar image from each frame .",
    "the residuals are transformed to a common sky orientation and then combined to estimate the star - subtracted object field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subtraction_overview ] ) , corresponding to the disk emission .",
    "we detail our procedure , including the refinements for tracking changes in the time - variable ao psf , in appendix  [ ap : roll_sub ] .      immediately after bias subtraction and flat fielding",
    ", we corrected the camera s geometric distortion in each image .",
    "however , no attempt was made to calibrate for the scale and orientation of the detector on the sky , as any differences from nominal values are expected to be minor .",
    "when visually comparing with _",
    "hst _ imaging  (  [ subsec : hst_data ] ) , we found a @xmath14 rotation between the two sets .",
    "our calibrations for photometry require measurement of zero point and psf .",
    "we bracketed our observations of au  mic  with photometric standard stars sj9170 and hd205772 on the first night , and gj811.1 on the second  @xcite .",
    "these observations were used to determine the photometric zero point in each band .",
    "the stars were positioned outside the coronagraphic spot , and aperture photometry was used to measure the stellar brightness . since",
    "large aperture radii could be used on the well - exposed stellar images , no encircled energy corrections were used in determining zero points . for all measurements , we applied an airmass correction assuming extinction values appropriate for mauna kea  @xcite .    to measure the scattering properties of the dust",
    ", we express the disk flux relative to that of the star .",
    "however , measuring the brightness of au  mic  is a challenge with this instrumental configuration because it is too bright for direct unocculted imaging , while observations using the focal plane mask complicate calibration . here",
    "we adopt 2mass photometry for the stellar brightness  ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we ignore the small ( @xmath2 few centi - mag ) color correction when transforming from _ k _  to _ _",
    "k__@xmath1 , as we expect disk photometry to be dominated by other errors . to determine the brightness of the star in _ _",
    "l__@xmath1 , we first measured the brightness of gj811.1 through the partially - transmissive focal plane spot in _ l_. we then applied a color correction to compute the zero point ( behind the spot ) in _ _",
    "l__@xmath1 , and measured the brightness of the au  mic  using the same photometric aperture , finding 4.38@xmath50.04 mag in _ _ l__@xmath1 .",
    "we note that our attempts to express the relative disk and stellar flux ratio should take au  mic s variability into consideration .",
    "the star regularly flares in the x - ray and euv regions of the spectrum  .",
    "periodic variations in the visible regions of the spectrum , thought to be caused by spots  , are also relevant . however , as noted by  , for au  mic  these are likely not problematic since the contrast between spots and the photosphere is lower in the near ir .",
    "it is convenient to measure surface brightness in rectangular photometric apertures , as are used in the calculations detailed in   [ subsec : sb_prof ] .",
    "because of the difficulty in using coronagraphic observations to infer the off - axis ( unobscured ) psf , we apply an aperture correction based on the enclosed energy in this aperture by using the unobscured observations of photometric standard stars as psf references . in each band , we average the enclosed energy over azimuthal rotation of the reference psf to simulate the final roll - subtracted image s psf .",
    "the aperture corrections we derived from these enclosed energy measurements are susceptible to variability in the ao psf because the reference psfs are measured non - contemporaneously from those of au  mic . to estimate the systematic errors in the overall flux levels , we examined the random error in the enclosed energy of the reference psf exposures in each band .",
    "the largest fluctuation on a single night was 16% .",
    "although the combination of data from both nights will reduce this uncertainty ( @xmath18 ) , the potential for unmeasured changes in the psf from the reference star to science measurements remains .",
    "with caution in mind , we estimate the uncertainty in flux calibration error in the final near - ir images at 20% and note that , in general , unsensed fluctuations will tend to affect the shorter - wavelength observations to a greater degree .",
    "this systematic calibration uncertainty will affect the absolute levels of the surface brightness profiles we measure in   [ subsec : sb_prof ] , and depending on the degree in correlation between errors in calibration in different bands , the disk colors  (  [ subsec : scat_col ] ) .",
    "measurements of color gradients will not be affected by this type of error .      in order to compare disk images over a wider range of wavelengths",
    ", we reduced and analyzed data previously obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "advanced camera for surveys in the _ f606w _",
    "filter ( @xmath19=606 nm , @xmath20 = 234 nm ) on 2004 april 03  .",
    "we acquired the flatfield images of au  mic  and the psf reference star hd216149 from the _ hst _ opus pipeline .",
    "these data were further calibrated by dividing by an appropriate spotflat and multiplying by a pixel area map .",
    "a final image of au  mic  was constructed by averaging three frames of 750 seconds integration each , with appropriate filtering to reject cosmic rays .",
    "the final image of hd216149 was constructed by averaging eight frames of 225 seconds each .",
    "we subtracted the psf subtraction in a manner described by  .",
    "there was no need to apply our specialized roll - subtraction technique ( appendix  [ ap : roll_sub ] ) to these data because of the stability of the acs psf .",
    "the psf - subtracted au  mic  image was then corrected for geometric distortion using a custom idl routine ( j. krist , private communication ) .",
    "we used the tiny tim psf model   to compute the enclosed energy in rectangular apertures to enable comparison of surface brightness profiles with our near - ir data .",
    "we used the same method for computing midplane surface brightness profiles described previously  (  [ subsec : calibration ] ) .",
    "we checked the consistency of our _ f606w _  midplane surface brightness measurements against those reported in  s fig .",
    "4 ( using their 025@xmath12025 apertures ) and found that our measurements of the same data were uniformly 0.20@xmath50.05mag brighter .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the fact that   divided their images by a factor of 1.124 when correcting their pixel areas from 28@xmath1225maspixel@xmath13 to 25@xmath1225maspixel@xmath13 ( j. krist , private communication ) .",
    "however , the photometric calibrations , both in the image headers and produced by synphot , assume that the final undistorted image is processed using drizzle .",
    "the drizzled data product is similar to the manual calibration performed above and in  , except that it does not include a uniform scaling of the image by a factor of 1.124 . to correct the error ,",

    "capturing the vertical structure of the disk is important for detailed physical models of the system .",

    "more recently ,  @xcite demonstrated that the linear polarization of the _ f606w _",
    "scattered light requires porous grains .",
    "these data are important because the degeneracy between scattering asymmetry and spatial distribution can weaken inferences of debris disk structure based solely on measurements of total intensity . as the structure , size , and compositions of the grains determine the scattering properties , the assumption of compact grain types in previous work warrants reexamination .",

    "[ subsec : dustmodeling ] we describe the methods and structure of our models , the process used to fit the models to the observed scattered light and sed , and the properties of the resulting best - fit models .",
    "we then examine these results in the context of the dynamical model of   for a steady - state grain distribution produced by a ring of parent bodies (  [ subsec : birthring ] ) .",
    "we model the debris disk around au  mic  using mcfost , a monte carlo radiative transfer code that uses the stokes formalism to treat the interaction between dust grains and photons to produce seds , scattered light images , and polarization maps .",
    "mcfost  is fully described in  @xcite , and we summarize its main features here .",
    "monochromatic photon packets are emitted by the star and propagated through the disk .",
    "the optical depth through which the photon travels before it interacts with a dust grain is randomly chosen from an @xmath65 probability distribution . scattered light and",

    "when monochromatic scattered light images and polarization maps are produced , photons are only allowed to scatter off dust grains , with a loss of intensity corresponding to the absorption cross - section of the grain .",
    "when the sed is computed , photons are either scattered or absorbed , depending on the local albedo ; in the latter case , they are immediately re - emitted at a longer wavelength selected on the basis of the local dust temperature .",
    "once photons exit the computing volume , they are stored in `` reception captors , '' corresponding to specific inclinations .",
    "maps at all inclinations are simultaneously created , but in this study we focused on the most edge - on captor , which includes inclinations ranging from 889 to 90 , believed to be appropriate for the inner disk of au  mic .    to calculate the thermal equilibrium of dust grains , and therefore seds ,",
    "the dust properties must be known throughout the electromagnetic spectrum , from the ultraviolet to the millimeter regime .",
    "it is not possible to describe the dust grains with a simple parametrization based on the albedo and the phase function asymmetry factor , for instance , unless these are known at all wavelengths .",
    "rather , mcfost  relies on mie theory ( i.e. , the grains are assumed to be spherical or essentially randomly oriented ) , so the knowledge of the dust optical indices ( the complex index of refraction ) at all wavelengths is sufficient .",
    "grains with complicated structure , such as porous aggregates , are approximated by spheres with an effective optical index at each wavelength .",
    "mie theory is used to calculate the scattering and absorption properties for these effective - medium spheres . in the case of au  mic ,",
    "small rayleigh - scattering grains are indicated by the blue color and high polarization fraction  @xcite . for composite grains , an effective medium approximation ( depending on the constituent materials and method for computing the effective indices ) can be reasonably accurate in the rayleigh limit  .",
    "mcfost  was first developed to model gas - rich , optically thick disks surrounding ttauri stars .",
    "several features have been added to efficiently and correctly treat the case of optically thin debris disks like au  mic .",
    "the first modification was to increase the computational efficiency of treating optically thin material .",
    "rather than expend effort computing the fates of all random photons , the majority of which will not scatter off grains in the optically thin disk , we enforce the first scattering of each photon packet to occur within the disk .",
    "the expected non - interacting photons are not randomly generated ; instead we analytically account for the corresponding transmitted starlight .",
    "this ensures that all randomly generated stellar photons scatter at least once in the disk without energy loss .",
    "second , in the absence of gas and given the low density of dust particles , the dust grains can not be considered to be thermally equilibrated with one another .",
    "rather , we compute a size - dependent temperature for the grains , each being in equilibrium with the surrounding radiation field . in the case of the au  mic  disk , this results in a significantly different shape of the sed in the mid - infrared due to large difference in temperature between grains of different size .",
    "future high - resolution spectra in the 10  region may measure features which can constrain the composition and size distribution of grains  .",
    "disk models frequently assume power - law descriptions for both the geometry of the disk and the grain size distribution . this is unlikely to reproduce all observed aspects of the disk , such as the complex small - scale structure seen in the scattered light (  [ subsec : structure ] ) .",

    "this is a model that qualitatively matches models proposed by   and  , where our inner annulus would represent the observable population of parent bodies and the outer zone the populations of small grains created by collisions of large bodies and swept out by pressure forces .    in both regions , we assume that the surface density and the grain size distributions follow @xmath66 and @xmath67",

    "the inner radius and transition radius between the inner and outer regions are free parameters .",
    "in addition , the surface density index , minimum and maximum grain size and distribution index , and the total dust mass in each of the two zones are free .",
    "we initially use a @xmath68 index for the size distribution , which is commonly assumed for debris systems and is suitable for a steady - state collisional cascade  @xcite . while both theory and observations may suggest specific functional forms for the vertical density profile of the disk , we cede to our preference for simplicity and assume that the vertical density distribution follows a gaussian with a fixed width of @xmath69au and a flat radial dependence . in this case , the photometric apertures capture the majority of the scattered light flux during brightness profile calculation .",
    "the particular choice of vertical density function is unimportant as long as the scale is much less than the photometric aperture height  (  [ subsec : sb_prof ] ) .",
    "we defer for future modeling the exploration of relationships between the form of the vertical density profile , the dependence of scale height with radius , grain scattering phase functions , and the geometry of the disk .",

    "considering the _ f606w_- and _ h_-band profiles and the sed , we obtain reasonable agreement with the predictions our two - zone model using porous grains : a region of large grains between 3540au , and a region of smaller grains outward of 40au .",
    "these are slightly further out than the best - fit regions using compact grains , which are more isotropically scattering .",
    "we find that , if the particles in the inner region are porous , they must be in the mm - regime ( sizes of 36 mm ) .",
    "allowing the size distribution to encompass smaller grains results in an overly steep long - wavelength sed as well as a flux deficiency in the outer small grain region .",
    "much larger bodies could be present yet undetectable ; they would emit very little , even at mm wavelengths . for porous dust in the outer region ,",

    "the masses in the inner and outer regions of the porous grain model are around @xmath79@xmath80 and @xmath81@xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the surface density profile falls rapidly outside of the transition radius ( index -2.5 to -3.0 ) , as expected from swept up material ; shallower indices yield an improved sed but insufficient scattered flux inside 40au and too - shallow profiles overall .",
    "steeper indices yield an excessively precipitous _",

    "this is only loosely constrained : the big grains never get very hot in this narrow annulus and there is little effect on the sed .",
    "we performed some exploration of the parameters to estimate uncertainties .",
    "the masses are relatively well constrained , to 50% or so , depending on the grain size distribution parameters .",
    "again , more mass could be hidden in the form of very large bodies in the inner region ; the mass derived here is just what is needed to reproduce the long wavelength end of the sed . in computing the total intensity of scattered light , there is an anticorrelation between @xmath82 and the region boundary at @xmath83au .",
    "we can adjust the minimum grain size by a factor of 2 , and the ring radius by @xmath84au and still achieve satisfactory _ f606w_- and _ h_-band profiles and sed .",
    "as demonstrated by  @xcite , the fractional linear polarization profiles provide a complementary constraint on the optical properties of the small grains .",

    "the porous grains generally follow the measured trend , and reach a plateau of 3035% by 40au , the starting location of the small outer grain region .",
    "this model has some shortcomings , in that it predicts excess flux around 6070  and a slightly too - shallow scattered - light profile in the _ h _  band outside of the transition radius .",
    "this latter point results in a predicted disk color that does not change outside of 1 , as opposed to the observations .",
    "we also note that the model profiles show less agreement with the _ j_- and _ _ k__@xmath1-band profiles ( fig .",

    "we have avoided goodness - of - fit metrics like @xmath31 because our model , by design , will fail to reproduce substructure in the scattered - light profiles .",

    "a formal @xmath31 analysis is not applicable , as we have also tuned our parameters to match the scattered light .",
    "in contrast to the porous grain model , the compact grain model underpredicts the 6070  flux . with their higher average albedo ,",
    "the compact grains absorb less energy than the porous ones ( table  [ tab : modelscatparms ] ) , suggesting a better fit may be obtained with grain albedos in the 0.60.7 range .",

    "we additionally mask the the diffraction spikes from each image when estimating the radial profiles @xmath178 , because the spikes blurring ( which we treat only by a scale factor @xmath0 ) can bias the profile estimates . in practice , we mask the disk with a 05-wide strip , and the spikes with regions that are 16 wide , tapering inward for @xmath179 . with @xmath180 and @xmath175",
    "in hand , the psf model for each image is parametrized solely by @xmath181 , which scales the speckle map .",
    "we subtract the model psf @xmath182 from each image .",
    "the map scale parameter @xmath181 and a registration offset are tuned to minimize subtraction residuals , which are rotated to a common frame and combined to form the image of the disk .",
    "special software masks are used in various stages of the subtraction process .",
    "diffraction spikes and the edge - on disk were masked during calculation of the radial profile .",
    "the disk was also masked from individual frames before they were combined to form the speckle map .",
    "diffraction spikes , the focal plane spot , and the disk were excluded from consideration during the least - squares optimization of the psf model subtraction .",
    "finally , diffraction spikes were masked from the subtraction residuals before they were combined to form the final disk image .    in summary ,",
    "the sequence is to    1 .",
    "register each frame to a fiducial position using stellar centroid estimates , 2 .",
    "mask the diffraction spikes and the disk , then extract the radial profile about the fiducial point ( @xmath178 ) , 3 .",
    "remove the profile and combine the residuals from each image to obtain the speckle map ( @xmath183 ) , 4 .",
    "construct a psf model for each image , using a scaled speckle map ( @xmath184 ) and the radial profile ( @xmath178 ) , 5 .   use an optimization method to subtract psf model from image , solving for stellar position and speckle map scale ( @xmath181 ) , 6 .   repeat the process from step ( 1 ) using updated centroid estimates if not in final iteration , 7 .",
    "mask diffraction spikes , rotate the subtraction residuals into the sky s frame , and combine to form the disk image estimate .",
    "we find that , for these data , three iterations of this process is enough for convergence to visually detectable levels .",
    "the subtraction procedure described in the previous sections is compared with similar implementations in figure  [ fig : subtraction_comparison ] . in panel _ ( a ) _ , we follow the steps we outlined above . in panel _ ( b ) _ , we restrict the model fitting process so that the scale of the speckle map ( @xmath181 ) is fixed and only offsets were optimized .",
    "finally , in _ ( c ) _ we discard the psf models altogether and fit the offset and scale of an average psf . no spike or object masking were used when combining residual images in _ ( c)_. in panel _ ( d ) _ we display curves of annular _ rms _ ( corresponding to the photometric errors shown in figure  [ fig : sbprof ] ) , excluding the regions near the disk .",
    "these curves show that fitting the speckle scale gives modest contrast gain ( @xmath185mag ) , while larger gains are obtained when removing the radial profile of the observations prior to combination ( @xmath186mag ) .",
    "when quoting sensitivity limits for the detection of point sources around a star , it is common practice to measure the standard deviation of pixel values in concentric annuli , @xmath187 , and to set a scale to this curve with artificially inserted sources . in this case , @xmath28 represents a by - eye threshold . here",
    "we wish to extend this methodology for the case of sources within the disk . to this end",
    ", we adopt a model for the sensitivity and solve for this model s parameters through visual detection of randomly inserted sources ( both inside and outside of the disk ) and maximum likelihood techniques .",
    "we assume that the process of detecting a source can be characterized by zero - mean , normally distributed background noise fluctuations . in this case",
    ", the background can be characterized by @xmath28 , and the probability of detecting a source ( denoting @xmath188 for detection ) of flux @xmath189 is given by @xmath190,\\ ] ] which is the cumulative normal distribution function .",
    "our task is to determine @xmath28 , which we can assume is proportional to @xmath187 in regions devoid of disk light .",
    "similarly , in the disk midplane , we expect an additional contribution to the background fluctuations from the disk light . for our ground - based observations ,",
    "these fluctuations are dominated by speckle noise ( including strehl fluctuations ) rather than photon statistics , and therefore the variance of this contribution is proportional to the square of the disk brightness , @xmath191  .",
    "we model the sensitivity in the midplane by @xmath192 we fix @xmath193 to model the sensitivity in regions devoid of disk light .",
    "we measure @xmath187 with a sigma - clipped sample standard deviation of pixels in concentric annuli , excluding regions of disk emission .",
    "we randomly generated positions and fluxes for artificial sources to be inserted in each of our ground - based images .",
    "two populations of sources were generated  one set randomly distributed along the disk midplane , and another in the off - disk region .",
    "the number of sources in each population was drawn from a poisson distribution , and no blending of sources was allowed .",
    "fluxes were drawn from a log - uniform distribution about @xmath194 in the midplane and @xmath195 elsewhere .",
    "after the computer inserted the randomly generated sources , the images were inspected and detections recorded .",
    "false detections were ignored in our analysis .    with these data in hand , the problem reduces to finding the most likely model parameters ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 ) given the set of artificial source positions , fluxes , and detections @xmath198 .",
    "our sensitivity curves will use the model parameters which maximize the probability density @xmath199 .",
    "this quantity can be re - written with bayes theorem , @xmath200 the final step is valid since we are free to choose the position and flux distribution of independent artificial sources without regard to the model parameters .",
    "our prior information on the model parameters is represented by @xmath201 , and we assume uniform distributions which are also independent of @xmath202 .",
    "we maximized the logarithm of this function with respect to @xmath196 and @xmath197 for each of our _ j__h___k__@xmath1  images , to obtain best - fit 1-@xmath28 sensitivities , and we show our 5-@xmath28 point source detection sensitivity as a function of separation from the star in figure  [ fig : sensitivity ] .",
    "midplane sensitivities are averaged over both ansae .",
    "we show predicted planet brightnesses using models of  @xcite at different ages , allowing inference of detection limits for planet mass .",
