    "some high - t@xmath1 superconductors , such as bi@xmath4sr@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , absorb very strongly in the microwave regime even at temperatures @xmath6 far below @xmath7@xcite . at a fixed frequency as a function of @xmath6 , the real conductivity typically has two features : a sharp peak near @xmath7 , and a broad , frequency - dependent background extending to quite low @xmath6 .",
    "the peak near t@xmath1 is usually ascribed to critical fluctuations arising from the superconducting transition .",
    "the origin of the broad background is less clear . in conventional s - wave superconductors",
    ", there is no such background , because the material can not absorb radiation at frequencies below the energy gap for pair excitations , @xmath8 .",
    "but in high - t@xmath1 materials , which are thought to have a @xmath9 order parameter@xcite , the gap vanishes in certain nodal directions in @xmath10-space .",
    "hence , gapless nodal quasiparticles can be excited at arbitrarily low @xmath6 , and these can absorb at low frequencies .",
    "but the observed absorption appears to be stronger than expected from the quasiparticles alone in a two - fluid model@xcite .",
    "several authors have suggested quenched inhomogeneities as the origin of this extra absorption .",
    "such inhomogeneities could arise from statistical fluctuations in the local densities of holes or impurities , or from the presence of superfluid - suppressing impurities such as zn .",
    "et al_@xcite found that such fluctuations in bi@xmath4sr@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath4o@xmath5 displace about 30% of the spectral weight from the condensate to the conductivity at finite frequencies .",
    "in addition , several explicit models have been presented which produce such a displacement .",
    "for example , van der marel and tsvetkov@xcite have calculated the fluctuation conductivity due to a periodic one - dimensional modulation of the phase stiffness .",
    "the present authors@xcite have calculated the fluctuation conductivity of a two - dimensional array of josephson junctions with quenched randomness in the critical currents , using the kubo formalism@xcite .",
    "they found an excess contribution to the conductivity below @xmath7 arising from this inhomogeneity , which arose from displacement of some of the superfluid contribution from zero to finite frequencies .",
    "more recently , orenstein@xcite considered a two - fluid model of superconductivity with quenched , anticorrelated inhomogeneity in both the normal and superfluid densities ; he found that some of the spectral weight of the conductivity is displaced from zero to finite frequencies , and gave explicit expressions for this extra conductivity .",
    "han@xcite has given a field - theoretic treatment of a randomly inhomogeneous two - dimensional d - wave superconductor , using a replica formalism to treat the assumed weak disorder .",
    "he obtained an extra lorentzian peak in the real conductivity , centered at zero frequency , arising from this disorder , and a corresponding reduction in the superfluid density .",
    "all such models are made more plausible by imaging experiments which have directly observed spatial fluctuations in the local superconducting energy gap in underdoped cuprate superconductors@xcite .    in this paper , we study the low - frequency complex conductivity of several models for two - dimensional superconductors with quenched inhomogeneities .",
    "we use a straightforward approach to obtain the effective complex conductivity , based on standard treatments of randomly inhomogeneous media in the quasistatic regime@xcite . from this approach , we obtain sum rules for the complex conductivity . we also find , in a number of cases , explicit expressions for the extra conductivity @xmath11 due to the quenched inhomogeneities .",
    "where the models are comparable , our explicit form for @xmath11 reduces to that of han , even though obtained using a quite different approach .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we develop sum rules for the optical conductivity of a two - dimensional superconductor with quenched inhomogeneities , and apply them to several explicit models . in section iii , we present some approximate calculations for the effective conductivity of such superconductors@xcite . a concluding discussion",
    "is given in section iv .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional superconductor , in which the local conductivity has normal and superfluid contributions which act in parallel , but , in contrast to the usual two - fluid model , these terms are spatially varying .",
    "the complex local conductivity @xmath12 is taken as a scalar function of position @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 of the following form : @xmath15 @xmath16 might be a contribution from the nodal quasiparticles expected in a superconductor with @xmath9 order parameter symmetry , while @xmath0 represents the perfect - conductivity response of the superconductor .",

    "we also predict that , near an inhomogeneous superconductor - normal transition , the height of the inhomogeneity peak in @xmath178 diverges while its half - width goes to zero .",
