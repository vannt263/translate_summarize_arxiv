    "the study of neutrino masses and mixing is one of the most interesting issues in particle physics which has also considerable impact on astrophysical and cosmological problem .",
    "looking for evidence of mixing neutrino flavors during its propagation is one method to detect massive neutrinos .",
    "if neutrinos propagate through matter , mixing effects can be enhanced .",
    "the electrons in the background matter induce the mass to the electron neutrino trough a charged current . in non - uniform medium density changes on the way of neutrinos",
    "therefore the mixing angle changes during propagation and the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are no more eigenstates of propagation . transitions between mass eigenstates can occur .",
    "the level crossing probability is known as the landau - zener probability @xcite .",
    "if density changes slowly enough those transition can be neglected so the mass eigenstates propagates independently , as it does in the vacuum or in a uniform medium .",
    "this is called the adiabatic condition .",
    "the solar neutrino conversion is correctly described with the adiabatic condition with accuracy of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "if the density changes rapidly like inside supernovas the adiabatic condition is not satisfied , then the probability of transition between the mass eigenstates becomes relevant .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention in the deduction of the level crossing probability expanding the temporal evolution operator , we found an general expression for this probability and we arrived to the usual one taking the first term in the perturbation expansion . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we briefly review the basic elements for describing neutrino oscillations in a medium , the standard classic probability is derived from a geometrical picture . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we develop a perturbation method to find the temporal evolution which allow us to find the level crossing probability .",
    "we found that it differs from landau - zener probability by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "in the standard model of neutrinos @xcite with @xmath2 a neutrino state propagating in the matter is assumed to be a linear combination of the flavor states @xmath3 and @xmath4    @xmath5 with @xmath4 being a determined linear combination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the two - neutrino system propagating in matter obeys the schrodinger equation @xmath8 with @xmath9 . using the pauli spin matrices @xmath10 in the ultra relativistic approximation",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in the matter basis , @xmath15 , the hamiltonian is diagonalized to @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 which give us two eigenvalues @xmath19 associated with the effective masses @xmath20 .",
    "plotting @xmath21 with respect to @xmath22 we find two hyperbolas with the asymptotic behavior @xmath23 the differences between the curves and the asymptotes satisfy @xmath24 so the asymptotes @xmath25 represent the mean value of the squared mass in the flavor states .",
    "furthermore the probability of finding the eigenstate in some flavor is given by how close the hyperboles are from the asymptotes .",
    "we can interpret fig .",
    "[ masses ] in the classical way .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath26 electronic neutrinos are produced inside matter , classically there is @xmath27 neutrinos of mass @xmath28 and @xmath29 neutrinos of mass @xmath30 .",
    "when they go into the vacuum they are going detected like @xmath31 neutrinos of electronic type . then the survival probability is @xmath32 actually the neutrinos of mass @xmath28 travelling trough matter can be converted into neutrinos of mass @xmath30 and vice - versa because a quantum tunneling effect .",
    "the number of conversions must be proportional to the difference @xmath33 , so when they travel in the vacuum there will be @xmath34 neutrinos of mass @xmath28 and @xmath35 neutrinos of mass @xmath30 , where @xmath36 is the conversion probability .",
    "the number of detected electronic neutrinos is @xmath37 and the probability for detecting a neutrino electronic is now @xmath38 the conversion probability @xmath36 is known the landau - zener probability",
    "now let us calculate the landau - zener probability from the schrodinger equation for the neutrino system .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath39 in ( [ 6 ] ) contribute only with an overall phase physically meaningless , so we can drop it . when neutrinos are produced inside matter the mixing angle changes if the density is a function of the position .",
    "the angle @xmath40 depends on time while the neutrino traveling in matter .",
    "the schrodinger equation in the matter eigenstates now read @xmath41 that is @xmath42 from ( [ h2 ] ) @xmath43 determine the energy transition between the two eigenstates and @xmath44 give the gap between levels . if @xmath45 the off - diagonal terms of the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 can be neglected and the system of equations for the eigenstates decouple .",
    "this is the condition of adiabaticity . for non - adiabatic limit",
    "we can not decouple the neutrino system .",
    "the survival probability for electronic neutrino is @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the components of the neutrino electronic in the basis of the hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "@xmath49 is the temporal evolution operator which satisfy the schrodinger equation    @xmath50    because of unitary @xmath49 can be written as    @xmath51    where the @xmath52 are real and @xmath53 .",
    "the probability ( [ p1 ] ) in function of this parameters is written as@xcite    @xmath54    the @xmath52 coefficients can be found solving equation ( [ h3 ] ) which can be written in a differential form @xmath55 with the condition @xmath56 . from ( [ h4 ] )",

    "the landau - zener probability is @xmath81 from ( [ phi ] ) we obtain @xmath82 considering that the main contribution is near the resonance region , @xmath83 and assuming the neutrinos are produced above this region we can extend the limits of the integral in ( [ p1 ] ) over all @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 the integral in ( [ h8 ] ) has poles in @xmath87 .",
