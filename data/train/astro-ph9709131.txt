    "the way the correction is done may not be the unique solution .",
    "in particular , if the lyman@xmath0 complexes have large dimensions , the redshift range corresponding to the hubble flow and velocity structure of the cloud along the radial dimension must be avoided .",
    "the large dimensions ( , dinshaw et al .",
    "1995 , smette et al .",
    "1995 , crotts & fang 1997 ) recently derived from observations of lines of sight towards quasars projected on the sky at small separations may support this remark .",
    "the existence of a turn - over in the column density is thus still a matter of debate ; the question being related to the effective size of the complexes .",
    "more data are needed to investigate this question .",
    "one of the most important issue to clarify towards understanding nature of the lyman@xmath0 forest is the relation between the lyman@xmath0 forest and galaxies .",
    "although conclusions are uncertain , it seems that at least the strongest lines in the lyman@xmath0 forest at low redshift are anyhow associated with galaxies ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 , le brun et al .",
    "this is not really surprizing since if there is gas in the intergalactic medium ( and it seems there is ) , we can expect the density of this gas to be higher in the vicinity of the galactic potential wells .",
    "the case for the weak lines to be associated with galaxies is less clear .",
    "indeed observations of the line of sight to 3c273 that are the most sensitive to the presence of weak lines ( morris et al .",
    "1991 , bahcall et al .",
    "1991 ) indicate the presence of a large number of these lines and no clear association with galaxies is seen ( morris et al .",
    "1993 , see also bowen et al .",

    "several components are seen in most of these weak systems ; thus the two - point correlation function shows a signal on scale smaller than . on this basis , fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the observed clustering is broadly compatible with that expected for galaxies .",
    "it can be argued however that the signal detected in the correlation function is not related to clustering of galaxies but instead reflects the velocity structure of the lyman@xmath0 gas inside large complexes .",
    "although such clustering is observed as well for metal line systems ( petitjean & bergeron 1994 , see cristiani et al .",
    "1996 ) , this does not mean that both lyman@xmath0 complexes and metal line systems are identical in nature since lyman@xmath0 complexes have lower abundances ( hellsten et al .",
    "1997 ) and larger dimensions .",
    "indeed a more attractive picture arises from simulations showing that the lyman@xmath0 absorption line properties can be understood if the gas traces the gravitational potential of the dark matter ( cen et al .  1994 ,",
    "petitjean et al .",

    "part of the gas is located inside filaments where star formation can occur very early in small halos that subsequently merge to build - up a galaxy ( haehnelt et al .",
    "it is thus not surprizing to observe metal lines from this gas .",
    "the remaining part of the gas either is loosely associated with the filaments and has or is located in the underdense regions and has .",
    "most of the lyman@xmath0 forest arises in this gas and it is still to be demonstrated that it contains metals .    to clarify these issues ,",
    "it is important to follow the evolution of the lyman@xmath0 gas over a wide redshift interval up to the current epoch ( ) distinguishing between gas closely associated with the filamentary structures of the dark matter and the dilute gas mainly located in the underdense regions .",
    "the problem which the true hydrodynamic simulations are still confronted with is the huge amount of computer time needed to model a whole line of sight .",
    "the goal of our paper is then twofold : to investigate the time - dependence of the lyman@xmath0 forest along the whole line of sight , and to investigate the relative contributions of the two different gas distributions to the forest characteristics . in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the main assumptions of the model and the limits of applicability .",
    "results and predictions of the model are presented in section 3 . and conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "we have used the particle - mesh code described in detail by kates et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , modified as described in our previous paper ( mcket et al .",
    "a particle simulation is used in order to investigate the evolution of the lyman@xmath0 forest over a wide redshift range using two main assumptions :    first , the lyman@xmath0 gas traces the shallower potential wells of the dark matter distribution . in previous papers ( petitjean et al .",
    "1995 , mcket et al .",
    "1996 ) we have already discussed in detail the applicability of this approximation as well as its consequences : the gas with column density smaller than closely follows the dark matter distribution .",
    "this assumption has been shown to be valid for the low - density regime characteristic of the lyman@xmath0 forest by detailed hydro - simulations ( see miralda - escud et al .  1996 , hernquist et al .",
    "1996 , yepes et al .",
    "1997 , and also gnedin et al .",
    "1997 , hui et al .  1997 ) .",
    "secondly , a procedure to determine the gas temperature has to be introduced .",
    "we follow kates et al .",
    "( 1991 ) where it is assumed that energy is acquired by the gas , in addition to photo - ionization , when shell crossing takes place in the dark matter dynamics .",
    "particles that have acquired this way enough energy to increase the temperature above are called shocked ( population @xmath1 ) .",
    "this temperature corresponds to the lower limit of the range of equilibrium temperatures found for different densities and uv flux intensities in highly ionized metal - poor gas .",
    "other particles are called unshocked ( population @xmath2 ) .",
    "the thermal history is followed as described in mcket et al .",
    "( 1996 ) taking into account adiabatic effects , radiative cooling processes , compton cooling and heating . as discussed in the previous paper ,",
    "this is a reasonable treatment as far as the lyman@xmath0 forest is concerned .",
    "clearly our approximation fails for column densities .",
    "therefore a description of the distribution and state of the gas in dense collapsing regions would lead to uncertain results .",
    "to first order , the distinction between shocked and unshocked gas in the code is independent of resolution since shocks should be supressed by thermal pressure in population @xmath2 .",
    "the approximation is valid if the grid size is smaller than the jeans length .",
    "according to mcket et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this requires where @xmath8 denotes the comoving length of a cell . at",
    "we obtain which is fairly well realized in our simulations .",
    "the gas constituent of each particle can thus be considered as a non - collapsing diffuse gas element .",
    "the gas is considered in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the assumption is no longer valid at very low densities .",
    "our simulation is limited to the cosmic background density however and thus to where deviation from equilibrium is minimized .",
    "the simulations use @xmath9 particles on a @xmath10 grid and were carried out using a box size of 12.8  mpc , which corresponds to a co - moving cell size of 50  kpc .",
    "the baryonic mass is assumed to be proportional to the dark matter mass inside a cell .",
    "we adopt a value for the hubble parameter and throughout .",
    "the intensity of the photo - ionizing uv background flux , assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic inside the simulation box , is computed in the course of the simulation .",
    "the ionizing spectrum is modeled as where is the ionizing flux at 13.6  ev .",
    "the variation of the flux intensity with redshift @xmath11 is related both to the rate at which the baryonic material cools below ( with ) in the simulation and to the expansion of the universe : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a factor of proportionality . to avoid overcooling ( e.g.  blanchard et al .",
    "1992 ) , we assume that the cool gas is transformed into stars with an efficiency @xmath14 of about 8% . the remainder of the gas is reheated to temperatures above 50000  k. the characteristic time scale for such processes is of order .",
    "this procedure provides therefore results that are independent of the time step .",
    "whereas the time dependence of the uv flux is almost not affected by the value of @xmath15 within a reasonable range , the value of the efficiency parameter @xmath14 has considerable influence on the flux intensity at small redshifts ( see also miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ) : in this scenario it determines the amount of gas still available at any time for star formation .",
    "the dynamics of structure formation is highly sensitive to the initial fluctuation spectrum .",
    "since we are working here on scales mainly determined by the @xmath16 tail of the cdm spectrum , only the effective amplitude of the spectrum within the @xmath17-range of interest is of importance .",
    "in particular it affects the redshift evolution of the computed uv flux intensity .",
    "we have used this dependence to constrain the power of the initial density fluctuations in the simulation in order to be able to reproduce the observed evolution ( see section  [ decrement ] ) .",
    "the resulting effective power is 10% larger than what is expected from a cobe spectrum normalized at large scales .    during the simulation we distinguish between the two different populations of clouds defined above namely : population @xmath1 corresponds to particles for which shock - heating has been important at some time of the thermal history of the particle and population @xmath2 to particles for which photo - ionization is the dominant heating process all the time .",
    "population @xmath1 particles are mostly found in big halos and elongated filamentary structures ( regions of enhanced density ) .",
    "the remainder of the gas ( population @xmath2 ) is present in the surroundings of the structures formed by shocked particles but mostly in the voids delineated by these structures .    the spatial distribution of both populations of particles at different redshifts ( ) in a slice of dimensions ( comoving ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 3fig ] . in this figure",
    "all particles in the slice are shown regardless of their neutral hydrogen content .",
    "the fraction of particles belonging to population @xmath2 is changing with time : 77% at , 67% at , 40% at and 25% at .",
    "the modeling of the cloud distribution along a full line of sight up to a fictitious qso at redshift is described in detail in mcket et al .",
    "we use the simulation to synthesize spectra along a line of sight .",
    "two examples of such spectra are given in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the lyman@xmath0 forest at and 0.3 respectively with resolution and @xmath5 ratio similar to keck / hires and future hst / stis observations respectively ( see section  [ evolution ] ) .",
    "the wavelength ranges are chosen to correspond to the same comoving distance .",
    "to analyse the data , we have developped an automatic line fitting procedure within the eso data reduction package midas taking advantage of the context fitlyman .",
    "the procedure selects regions of the spectrum between two wavelengths at which the normalized continuum is unity .",
    "within such a region , it determines the position of the minima and starts by placing one component at each minimum , considering the central wavelengths as fixed parameters .",
    "column densities and doppler parameters are determined minimizing the reduced @xmath18 .",
    "components are then introduced where the difference between the model and the data is at maximum .",
    "a new fit is performed relaxing the positions .",
    "a detailed investigation of the ability of automatic line profile fitting to derive reliable information on the underlying population will be presented elsewhere .",
    "due to blending effects , comparison between simulations and observations is not simple .",
    "a first test of the model is that the evolution of the average lyman@xmath0 decrement should be reproduced .",
    "as emphasized by miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the decrement depends on the mean hi density which is directly related to where @xmath19 is the baryon density and is the ionizing flux at 13.6  ev . in our simulations ,",
    "the baryon density is given a value 0.05 ( ) and the evolution with redshift of the ionizing flux is computed assuming that its variation is related to the amount of gas that collapses in the simulation at any time ( see section  [ simul ] ) .",
    "the only free parameter is thus the normalization of .",
    "a value of at ( see fig .  [ flux ] ) fits the decrement evolution quite well ( see fig .  [ da ] ) .",
    "our result for the intensity of the uv - background at is consistent with the findings by hernquist et al .",

    "is obtained however by rauch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the observed number of sources and absorbers of ionizing photons .",
    "a reason for this discrepancy could be that we have adopted a constant spectral shape for the uv spectrum . since the ionization equilibrium is determined by the ionization parameter that is the ratio of the density of ionizing photons to the hydrogen density , a steeper spectrum or a break at 54.4  ev ( e.g haardt & madau , 1996 ) would have given a larger normalization by a factor of about 2 .",
    "determinations of the uv background intensity from observations of the proximity - effect however give much larger values , in the redshift range ( bechtold 1994 ; bajtlik et al .",
    "1988 ; lu et al .",
    "1991 , giallongo et al .  1996 , cooke et al .  1996 ) and at ( williger et al .",
    "this is up to five times larger than what we obtain for the corresponding redshifts .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy could be that the basic assumption made when applying the proximity - effect technique ( bajtlik et al .  1988 ) is not valid .",
    "indeed it is assumed that in the absence of the qso ionizing flux , the number density of the lines in the vicinity of the quasar would evolve according to an extrapolation of the power law found far away from the quasar .",
    "it seems probable however that qsos are located in regions of enhanced density . in that case",
    "a strong increase of the number of lines in the vicinity of quasars should be expected .",
    "if true , the technique would systematically overestimate the uv background intensity .",
    "this has been mentioned previously by bechtold ( 1994 ) and williger et al .",

    "fitting the lyman@xmath0 forest is ususally done using voigt profile deblending procedures .",
    "even though blending is a severe limitation for this analysis at , it is interesting to compare the observed number of lines with the simulated number of clouds which is perfectly defined . for , the lines are not numerous enough for blending to be a problem and their number is known from observations in the complete range .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",

    "it is apparent that the dominant population is different before and after . at high redshift ,",
    "most of the lines arise in @xmath2 particles whereas at low redshift , most of the gas is condensed in filamentary structures ( see petitjean et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "let us assume that most of the @xmath2 clouds are co - expanding and optically thin .",
    "if we also assume the flux to be nearly constant over the redshift range considered , then the evolution of the column density for each cloud is , i.e.  the column density of such clouds is a rapidly decreasing function of time .",
    "therefore , at high redshift , the number density of clouds situated in the underdense regions is , at a given column density , strongly decreasing with time .",
    "that might explain the very steep slope found for the number density evolution of the @xmath2 clouds as shown in fig .",
    "[ dndz_sep ] .",
    "the number density of lines with is about constant over the redshift range ( see fig .  [ dndz12 - 14 ] ) and decreases slowly at lower redshift .",
    "note , however that due to the limited resolution the number density at for column densities is probably underestimated .",
    "low density gas is found in regions delineated by filamentary structures at high redshift .",
    "this gas slowly disappears ( see fig .",
    "[ 3fig ] ) .",
    "the total number density of lines stays nearly constant because the high column density gas has column density decreasing with time .",
