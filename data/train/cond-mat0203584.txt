    "in disordered and mesoscopic systems , one of the most important phenomena is the universal behavior which is determined by the symmetries of the hamiltonian and by the dimensionality of the system .",
    "for instance the conductance fluctuation in mesoscopic system is known to be independent of the conductance itself and the shape of the conductor , while it depends on whether or not the magnetic field are added in the system .",
    "@xcite another example is a localization property of disordered system .",
    "the scaling theory of anderson localization indicates that the transition only occur at three dimension regardless of a local hamiltonian of the system .",
    "@xcite    the hamiltonians of disordered system can be classified to ten types by time - reversal symmetry , spin - rotation symmetry and so on which are not spatial .",
    "this classification follows from one - to - one correspondence of these hamiltonians to riemannian symmetric spaces in mathematical terminology .",
    "@xcite for the correspondence to actual physical system , these ten classes can be divided into three classes , standard , chiral and bogoliubov - de gennes ( b - dg)classes .",
    "the standard class corresponds to the system which has a disordered potential .",
    "the chiral class is applied to the dirac particles in a random gauge field and the tight binding model with random nearest - neighbor hopping term .",
    "the b - dg class is found out when the system obeys the bogoliubov - de gennes equation .",
    "@xcite two dimensional random bond ising model is also classified to this class .",
    "@xcite    this classification is believed to be correct regardless of the dimensionality . we , however , concentrate on the quantum wire ( quasi - one dimensional system ) . the quantum wire we consider is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : c ] . different from one dimensional system ,",
    "there are several propagating modes @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of different propagating states and @xmath3 is the number of degeneracies .",
    "another feature of a quantum wire is that transport properties change whether or not @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] is longer than the localization length , @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 , it behaves like an insulator , while it behaves like a metal if @xmath7 .    for mesoscopic systems ,",
    "the transport quantities can be calculated by use of the transfer matrix as follows .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath8 that connects left side states with right side states is represented as @xmath9 due to the flux conservation of the system , the matrix @xmath8 belongs to pseudo - unitary group @xmath10 .",
    "provided that the system satisfies additional symmetries ( time reversal , spin rotation , chiral etc . )",
    ", @xmath8 belongs to the subgroup of @xmath10 .",
    "these subgroups to which each universality classes belongs and the symmetries satisfied are summarized in table  [ tab : a ] .",
    "the transfer matrices can be decomposed to relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are @xmath13 unitary matrices and x is an @xmath13 diagonal matrix with eigenvalues @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath15 are relevant variables while matrix elements of @xmath12 are irrelevant ones , because transport quantities are expressed in terms of only @xmath15 . in this paper , we consider the following three quantities .    1",
    ".   conductance @xmath16 : @xmath17 2 .",
    "shot - noise power @xmath18 : @xmath19 3 .",
    "conductance @xmath20 for a system with a normal - superconducting junction : @xmath21    equation   is called the multi - channel landauer formula and was derived in this form in ref .  .",
    "the shot - noise power means the time fluctuation of the current and eq .",
    "was first obtained in ref .  .",
    "when the system has a normal metal - superconducting junction , the reflection of particles on this interface becomes anomalous ( andreev reflection ) , and the landauer formula is changed to eq .  .",
    "@xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] . note that this formula is applicable only if the time - reversal symmetry is satisfied . in the case where the time - reversal symmetry is broken , eq .",
    "is not correct and we do not consider such case in this paper .",
    "the transport quantities we are interested in are statistical quantities which can be written in terms of correlation functions obtained from the probability distribution @xmath22 over impurity configurations . in general",
    "one represents a transport quantity @xmath23 as @xmath24 then the average @xmath25 and the variance @xmath26 for impurity configurations are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are one- and two - point correlation functions respectively , @xmath30 we expand @xmath28 and @xmath29 by @xmath31 .",
    "the term of @xmath32 represents the universal behavior . in @xmath29",
    ", we see that the first term in the expression is of the order @xmath32 .",
    "thus the fluctuation of the transport quantity is universal . on the other hand , in @xmath28",
    "the first term is @xmath33 and the second is @xmath32 .",
    "the first term can be interpreted as the average in which propagating modes are regarded as classical particles , while the second exhibits the quantum correction .",
    "we shall obtain the universal terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all ten universality classes with respect to a quantum wire .",
    "our main results are eq . , eq . , eq . and eq .. those universal terms have already been obtained for standard class but not for chiral and b - dg classes . the purpose of this paper is to clarify how the difference of universality classes influences the universal behavior of transport properties .",
    "the form of @xmath34 depends on the dimensionality of the system . in a quantum dot ( zero dimensional system )",
    "this becomes the ensemble of the random matrix theory(rmt ) ,  @xcite @xmath35 in rmt , @xmath36 -point correlation functions ( @xmath37 ) are independent of @xmath38 in case that @xmath2 becomes infinity . and they can be evaluated exactly .",
    "@xcite in a quantum wire , the probability distribution is known to satisfy the following scaling equation called dmpk equation .",
    "this was first obtained in standard classes .",
    "@xcite recently these equations for chiral and b - dg classes were obtained ,  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean free path , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 depend on universality classes :    * standard and b - dg classes @xmath43 * chiral class @xmath44    the value of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are listed in table  [ tab : a ] .",
    "note that the domains of @xmath15 are different for chiral and other classes .",
    "this is because in chiral class the value of @xmath15 is determined when the transfer matrix is fixed , but in other classes the sign of @xmath15 can not be determined .",
    "the sign can be absorbed in the irrelevant part ( @xmath12 in eq .  ) in standard and b - dg classes fixing the transfer matrix .",
    "we like to make a remark on eq .  . in ref",
    ".  , brouwer et.al",
    ". pointed out that for general chiral class , dmpk equation depends on another parameter in addition to the mean free path .",
    "the additional parameter follows from the geometric structure of the transfer matrices .",
    "the dmpk equation has a remarkable structure in mathematical point of view .",
    "it can be mapped into imaginary time schrdinger equation with the calogero - sutherland hamiltonian and is related to the diffusion in the corresponding symmetric space that is the coset between the group to which the transfer matrix belongs and its maximal compact subgroup .",
    "@xcite these cosets are described in table  [ tab : a ] .",
    "@xcite    .classification of the dmpk equation . in the second column @xmath47 is the cartan symmetric class , which denotes the symmetry class of the hamiltonian of the quantum wire .",
    "every class is classified by the time - reversal symmetry ( tr ) and spin - rotational symmetry ( sr ) : @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote whether the system preserves the symmetry or not .",
    "parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 characterize each universality class in @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath3 is the number of degeneracy of the transmission eigenvalue .",
    "the column labeled by @xmath2 represents the number of distinct propagating modes .",
    "@xmath50 in the column depends on the width w of the system illustrated in figure  [ fig : c ] .",
    "note that the total number of propagating modes @xmath51 is the same for each universality class though @xmath2 varies with each class . the transfer matrices @xmath8 belong to the pseudo - unitary group @xmath52 because of the flux conservation . provided the system preserves additional symmetries ( time - reversal , spin - rotation , chiral etc . ) , they reduce to the subgroup of @xmath52",
    ". @xmath53 denotes the maximal compact subgroup of each transfer matrix .",
    "the dmpk equation is related to the diffusion on the symmetric space @xmath54 . in this table , we follow the notations of lie group in ref  . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we summarize the universal transport properties of disordered quantum wire which have been shown in this paper .",
    "these results agree with the known results by use of moment expansion method for conductance and shot - noise power  @xcite and exact solutions of dmpk equations for some classes  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained the universal terms of transport quantities for general transport quantities , eq .   and for all ten universality classes .",
    "those results are new and have not been reported .      1 .",
    "the universal terms of averages of the transport quantities vanish in chiral classes due to eq .   while in standard and b - dg classes they depend on the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the form of @xmath55 .",
