    "recent shear flows studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have shown the importance of the early time dynamics , that in principle can lead to non - linear growth long before an exponential mode is dominant .",
    "the recognition of the existence of an algebraic growth , due - among other reasons - to the non - orthogonality of the eigenfunctions ( @xcite ) and a possible resonance between orr - sommerfeld and squire solutions ( @xcite ) , recently promoted many contributions directed to study the early - period dynamics .",
    "for fully bounded flows works by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and for partially bounded flows works by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite can be cited . as for free shear flows ,",
    "the attention was first aimed in order to obtain closed - form solutions to the initial - value inviscid problem ( @xcite , @xcite ) and was successful by considering piecewise linear parallel basic flow profiles .",
    "an interesting aspect observed in the intermediate periods is that the maximal amplification is generally associated to oblique disturbances , that , as a consequence , potentially can promote early transition , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in fact , these perturbations , which are asymptotically stable at all reynolds numbers , are the perturbations best exploiting the energy transient amplification .    in this work",
    "we consider as a prototype for free shear flow the two - dimensional wake past a bluff body .",
    "the wake stability has been widely studied by means of modal analyses ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , in this way only the asymptotic fate can be determined , regardless of the transient behavior and the underlying physical cause of any instability .    in this work",
    "we adopt the velocity - vorticity formulation to evaluate the general initial - value perturbative problem .",
    "this method was proposed by criminale , drazin and co - authors in the years 1990 - 2000 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in synthesis , the variables are laplace - fourier transformed in the plane normal to the basic flow .",
    "afterward , the resulting partial differential equations in time are integrated numerically .",
    "this procedure allows for completely arbitrary initial expansions by using a known set of functions ( schauder basis in the @xmath2 space ) and yields the complete dynamics  the early time transients and the asymptotic behavior ( up to many hundred time scales )  for any disturbance .",
    "the long term dynamics would not , in fact , have been easily recovered by using the alternative method of the direct numerical integration of the linear equations since the integration over a range of time larger than a few dozen basic time scales is not feasible .",
    "the base flow model that we employ includes the wake transversal velocity and thus the nonlinear and diffusive dynamics that are responsible for the growth of the flow and the associated mass entrainment .",
    "we consider the first two order terms of the analytical navier - stokes expansion obtained by tordella and belan ( 2002 , 2003 ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) , see  [ base flow ] .",
    "in particular , we consider the longitudinal component of such an expansion solution , the problem is parameterized by @xmath3 , the longitudinal coordinate , and the reynolds number @xmath4 .",
    "we use a complex wavenumber for the disturbance component aligned with the flow so that longitudinal spatially damped waves are represented .",
    "it should be observed that a longitudinal spatial growth could not be considered physically admissible as an initial condition since the energy density of the initial perturbation would be infinite . in the context of the initial - value problem , this is an innovative feature adopted to introduce a possible spatial evolution ( damping ) of the perturbative wave in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the perturbative equations are numerically integrated by the method of lines . the equations formulation and initial and boundary conditions are presented in  [ formulation ] .    the perturbation evolution is examined for the base flow configurations corresponding to the reynolds numbers of @xmath5 , and for a typical section , @xmath6 , of the intermediate region of the flow where the entrainment process is active .",
    "a comparison with a base flow far field configuration , @xmath7 , is also proposed .",
    "the normalized perturbation kinetic energy density is the physical quantity on which the transient growth is observed ( see  [ transient ] ) . to determine the temporal asymptotics of the disturbance an equivalent of the modal temporal growth rate",
    "is introduced ( see  [ asymptotic ] ) .    in the case of longitudinal disturbances ,",
    "comparison with recent spatio - temporal multiscale orr - sommerfeld analysis ( @xcite , @xcite ) and with laboratory experimental data ( @xcite ) is carried out , see  [ asymptotic ] . as noted , the initial conditions posed are arbitrary .",
    "as far as the modal theory is concerned , the agreement is excellent both for the frequency , defined as the temporal derivative of the perturbation phase , and the temporal growth rate .",
    "it is also in quantitative agreement with respect to the laboratory data .",
    "the experiment shows couples of pulsation and wavelength of the cylinder vortex shedding that are close to those yielded by the ivp analysis when the wavenumber is that where the growth rate is maximum .",

    "it should be noted that , even if the asymmetric perturbation leads to a much slower transient growth than that observed for the symmetric case , the growth rate become equal when the asymptotic states are reached ( see for example fig .",
    "[ ivp_comparison_nmt_ivp_kfixed ] ) . the temporal window shown in fig.3 ( @xmath109 )",
    "does not yet capture the asymptotic state of the asymmetric input .",
    "however , we observed that further in time the amplification factor @xmath103 reaches the same order of magnitude of the symmetric perturbation .",
    "the more noticeable results presented in fig .",
    "3 are that the asymmetric growths in the early transient are much less rapid than the symmetric ones and that the function @xmath103 , in the case of asymmetric perturbations only , shows a modulation which is very evident in the first part of the transient , and which corresponds to a modulation in amplitude of the pulsation of the instability wave , see fig.[pulsation ] .",
    "in fact , the pulsation varies : in the early transient it oscillates around a mean value with a regular period , which is the same visible on g , and with an amplitude which is growing until this value jumps to a new value around which oscillates in a damped way .",
    "this second value is the asymptotic constant value .",
    "this behavior is always observed in the case of asymmetric longitudinal or oblique instability waves .",
    "instead , it is not shown by transversal ( @xmath110 ) waves or by symmetric waves , see fig .",
    "4 , where , on the one hand , the asymptotic value , nearly equal to that of the asymmetric perturbation , is rapidly reached after a short monotone growth and where , on the other , the growth is many orders of magnitude faster , and as a consequence , a modulation would not be easily observable .",
    "thus , we may comment here on the fact that two time scales are observed in the transient and long term behavior of longitudinal and oblique perturbations : namely , the periodicity associated to the average value of the pulsation in the early transient , clearly visible in the asymmetric case only , and the final asymptotic pulsation . the asymptotic value of the pulsation is higher than the initial one , typically is about @xmath111 times higher .",
    "the period of the frequency modulation of the energy density @xmath103 is larger , nearly ( 1.4 - 1.7 ) higher , than the average period of the oscillating wave in the early transient , because @xmath103 is a square norm of the system solution .",
    "thus the evolution of the system exhibits two periodic patterns at different frequencies : the first , of transient nature , and the other of asymptotic nature .",
    "when the average damping of the energy density in the early transient is not strong and is then followed by a monotone asymptotic growth , the change of the frequency of the oscillation is evident , see fig.[pulsation ] .",
    "this kind of behavior is often observed in the study of linear systems with an oscillating norm , a problem that naturally arises in the context of the linearized formulation of convection - dominated systems over finite length domains .",
    "the occurrence of oscillating patterns in the energy evolution of the solutions is linked to the non - normal character of the linear operator which describes the system , see e.g. coppola and de luca ( 2006)@xcite .    .",

    "this trend is also typical of oblique and longitudinal waves , and it can be considered a universal feature in the context of the stability of near parallel shear flows . it should be noted that , in fig .",
    "[ g_r_k ] , the perturbation is symmetric and again the amplitude modulation is not observed in the early transient , even in the asymptotically stable situations .",
    "however , this example of transient behavior also contains a feature which is specific of orthogonal , both amplified or damped , and symmetric or asymmetric , perturbations , namely , the fact the most amplified component of the vorticity is the @xmath129 , see also fig.[dt_g_r_2d3d ] , part d.    in fig .",

    "in fact , for nearly uniform waves in @xmath8 direction ( @xmath130 ) the configurations are asymptotically damped in time , while for increasing values of the spatial damping rate the perturbations are amplified in time ( note that a logarithmic scale is used on part ( a ) of the figure ) .",
    "a possible general explanation is that the introduction in a physical system of a spatial concentration of kinetic energy is always destabilizing , hence the higher is the disturbance concentration the faster is the growth factor .",
    "the dramatically increased growth rate of the symmetric mode with respect to the asymmetric mode can be understood from the induced velocity of the vorticity field . for simplicity , imagine that the wake consists of two parallel shear layers of opposite vorticity , as shown in figure 8(a ) .",
    "further assume that the vorticity is discretized into a finite number of identical vortices .",
    "suppose the upper shear layer is perturbed into a sinusoidal shape , as shown in figure 8(b ) .",
    "the induced velocity at the crest of the sinusoid at point 1 due to the other vortices in the upper shear layer alone is up and to the right as indicated by the arrow , corresponding to the classical kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "now consider the asymmetric mode , so that the lower shear layer is a sinusoid in phase with the upper one ( figure 8(c ) ) . the induced velocity at the crest of the lower shear layer at point 2 due to the other vortices in the lower shear layer alone is exactly the opposite of that at point 1 .",
    "thus the growth in the asymmetric mode is due to only higher order gradients in the induced velocity field of one shear layer on the other .",
    "in contrast , with a symmetric perturbation , the lower shear is the mirror image of the upper . in figure 8(d ) , the induced velocity at point 2 is necessarily the mirror image of that at point 1 .",
    "both points move in concert to the right , without the low order velocity cancellation of the asymmetric mode .",
    "thus the symmetric mode grows much faster .",
    "this linear absolute instability takes place in the intermediate and far field and acts as a source of excitation for the pair of steady recirculating eddies in the lee of the cylinder .",
    "the onset of a time periodic flow , a supercritical hopf bifurcation ( @xcite , @xcite ) indicates that in the end the vortices are shed alternatively from the separated streamlines above and below the cylinder forming the von karman vortex street .",

    "however , it should be noted that the wave number corresponding to the maximum growth factor in the case of asymmetric perturbations is about 15% lower than that obtained in the case of symmetric perturbations and that obtained by the normal mode analysis .",
    "when the perturbations are asymmetric , the transient is very long , of the order of hundreds time scales .",
    "this difference can be due either to the fact that the true asymptote was not yet reached , or to the fact that the extent of the numerical errors in the integration of the equations is higher than that obtained in the case of symmetric transients , which last only a few dozen time scales .",

    "the introduction of the imaginary part of the longitudinal wavenumber ( the spatial damping rate ) was done to explicitly include in the perturbation , which otherwise would have been longitudinally homogeneous , a degree of freedom associated to the spatial evolution of the system .",
    "an important point is that the vorticity - velocity formulation , fourier - laplace transformation , allows ( over a reasonable lapse of computing time ) for the following of the temporal evolution over hundred of basic flow time scales and thus to observe very long transients .",
    "such a limiting behaviour would not have been so easily reached by means of the direct numerical integration of the linearized governing equations of the motion .",
