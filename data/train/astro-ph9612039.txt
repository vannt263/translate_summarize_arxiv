    "the origin of the @xmath6  kev diffuse x - ray background has long eluded a satisfactory explanation .",
    "the extrapolation of the extragalactic power law ( @xmath7 photons @xmath8 s@xmath9 sr@xmath9 kev@xmath9 ) from the @xmath10  kev band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) accounts for @xmath11% of the observed x - ray intensity at high galactic latitudes in the @xmath12  kev band ( @xcite ) . while there remains some discussion as to the exact normalization of the power law and shape of the spectrum below 2  kev ( e.g. , 9.2@xmath13 and no appreciable excess between 1 and 2  kev , @xcite ; 10.8@xmath13 , @xcite ) , all measurements agree that there is a strong excess above extrapolation of the 2  10 kev power law spectrum in the @xmath14  kev band .",
    "an upper limit to the contribution from the local hot bubble ( lhb , @xcite ) which extends out from 50 to a couple hundred parsecs is @xmath15% of the nominal high - latitude intensity , as revealed by a high - latitude x - ray shadow due to a nearby molecular cloud mbm 12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contributions from stellar sources ( e.g. , late type stars ) have been considered to explain the observed excess x - ray intensity in the galactic plane ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , however they do not produce a sufficient flux .",
    "although a substantial fraction of the thermal excess of the diffuse x - ray background at high galactic latitudes is from discrete extragalactic sources ( e.g. , agns ) , at least 25% of the diffuse x - ray emission is not due to agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant portion of the diffuse x - rays could still be galactic , yet from beyond the lhb even at high latitudes .",
    "the problem is even more severe when the intensity near the galactic plane is considered .",
    "the galactic plane is optically thick at these energies so _ all _ of the observed flux _ must _ be galactic in origin .",
    "the galactic diffuse x - ray emission beyond the lhb strongly suggests an abundance of galactic gas at @xmath16  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of the x - ray emitting material in the galactic plane beyond obvious supernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles is , however , poorly known .",
    "snowden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have recently suggested that the strong x - ray intensity seen above and below the plane in the general direction of the galactic center is due to a galactic x - ray bulge . the best way to study",
    "the galactic distribution of the x - ray emitting gas is to search for shadows in the diffuse x - ray background cast by absorbing high column - density molecular gas for which the distance can be determined .",
    "the utility of this approach has been demonstrated in the literature in the case of nearby neutral and molecular clouds at high galactic latitudes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we report the detection of deep x - ray shadows cast by dense molecular gas in the inner galaxy .",
    "these shadows imply an extensive flux of diffuse x - rays from the galactic center region .",
    "the line of sight of our study region , ( @xmath17 ) , extensively samples the inner galaxy ( 1.5  kpc minimum radius ) but still allows reliable velocity - derived distances for the molecular gas .",
    "this region has been covered by a mosaic of 7 independent pspc pointed observations , and by the galactic co survey of bitran ( 1987 ) .",
    "we use the co to derive both kinematic distances and molecular column densities for the absorbing gas , and the 100 @xmath18 m intensity as a tracer of total gas column density .",
    "the data used for this study are described in ",
    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "the analysis and the implications of the results are discussed in  [ sec : analysis ] and a summary and some conclusions are presented in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the co data used in the present study were taken from the galactic survey of bitran ( 1987 ) , which was carried out with the 1.2 m millimeter - wave telescope at cerro tololo , chile . at 115 ghz ,",
    "the frequency of the j = 1  0 rotational transition , this telescope has a beamwidth of @xmath19 ( fwhm ) and its 256-channel spectrometer provides a velocity resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath9 and total bandwidth of 333 km s@xmath9 .",
    "observations were spaced roughly every beamwidth ( @xmath20 ) on a galactic grid , and the rms sensitivity of 0.14  k ( t@xmath21 ) was more than adequate for the present purpose .",
    "the 100 @xmath18 m data ( @xcite ) for this region were obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive ( heasarc ) skyview facility which is maintained by nasa / gsfc .",
    "the displayed 100 @xmath18 m field ( figure  [ fig : irxr ] ) is @xmath22 centered at ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the infrared intensity for this field ranges from @xmath24  mjy  sr@xmath9 to @xmath25  mjy  sr@xmath9 and the angular resolution is @xmath26 .",
    "the 7 ( @xcite ) pspc pointed observations are listed in table  [ tbl : observations ] .",
    "data from all 7 pointings were obtained through the heasarc public archive . since non - cosmic contamination is not negligible in the study of the diffuse x - ray background , all identified non - cosmic contributions to the counting rate must be handled thoroughly .",
    "the particle background , scattered solar x - ray background , and long - term enhancements are modeled and subtracted from the data by following the methods described in the literature ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "contamination due to short - term enhancements including auroral x - rays , solar flares , and enhanced charged - particle rates encountered near the south atlantic anomaly and particle belts are removed by excluding all observation time intervals which display anomalous peaks in their light curves .",
    "for these 7 pointings , the modeled non - cosmic contamination ranges up to @xmath27% of the total observed x - ray counts and the mean contribution is @xmath15% .",
    "the individual pspc pointings with all identified non - cosmic contamination , point sources , and discrete small - scale extended emission features ( e.g. , g11.20.3 and w30 ) removed are merged into large - area mosaics in two bands : the @xmath28  kev band ( @xmath3  kev ) and the @xmath29  kev band ( 1.5  kev ) . the large amount of spectral overlap between the two bands is due to the relatively poor spectral resolution of the proportional counter .",
    "the determination of the relative offsets in the zero level between the individual observations is performed by comparing the average count rates in the overlapping regions between all pairs of observations .",
    "the contribution from this correction is typically small and is @xmath30% of the total counts for this field of view .",
    "the software for this task ( @xcite ) was provided by the us science data center ( usrsdc ) at nasa / gsfc .",
    "the feasibility of the software has been successfully demonstrated by a mosaic of the large magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final pspc mosaics of the region ( @xmath17 ) are displayed in figures  [ fig : irxr]a and [ fig : irxr]b . for purposes of display",
    ", the data were binned into @xmath31 pixels and smoothed . for the analysis of this paper ,",
    "the unsmoothed @xmath31 pixels were used , usually with further binning .",
    "this pixel size was selected since it is reasonably comparable to the spatial resolution of the 100  @xmath18 m and the co data without losing most of the detailed spatial structure of the x - ray emission .",
    "combined as a mosaic , the average exposure for this field is @xmath32  ks yielding @xmath33% statistical errors for individual pixels .",
    "the galactic plane in the range _",
    "@xmath34 10@xmath35  11@xmath35 shows a broad maximum in the far infrared and a corresponding minimum in 0.5  2.0 kev band x - rays ( figure  [ fig : irxr]a and figure  [ fig : irxr]b ) .",
    "although the intense point - like features in the far infrared map ( figure  [ fig : irxr ] ) arise from well - known galactic h  ii  regions such as w31 ( the cluster of sources near the center of the map ) , the more extended emission is considered to be a fairly reliable tracer of total gas column density on a galactic scale ( @xcite ) .",
    "no significant co concentration is associated with any of the cores in all velocity intervals except for the one associated with sgr 180620 at 15 kpc ( figure  [ fig : co]a , @xcite ) .",
    "since the in - plane gas density peaks about half - way between the sun and the galactic center ( @xcite ) , the anticorrelation seen in figure  [ fig : irxr ] suggests that a significant fraction of the x - rays arise from beyond the bulk of the gas , most likely in the galactic bulge .",
    "this location of the bulk of the x - ray emitting gas is supported by the more detailed anticorrelation seen between x - rays and the dense molecular component of the gas as traced by co. in figure  [ fig : co ] , the co emission is partitioned into 4 equal intervals of velocity and overlaid as contours on the 1.5 kev band x - ray map that has been smoothed to match the angular resolution of the co data .",
    "these four maps account for nearly all of the co emission in this direction ; similar co maps at higher velocities are blank or nearly so .",
    "the co emission is strongest and most widespread in the velocity range 15  30 km s@xmath9 ( figure  [ fig : co]b ) , and it is this emission which shows the best detailed anticorrelation with the x - rays . according to the galactic rotation curve of burton ( 1988 ) , such emission must arise either from the near distance interval 2.5  3.9 kpc ( as indicated above the plot ) or from the corresponding far interval 12.8  14.3 kpc",
    ". with such a large difference between the near and far distances , co maps at the scale and resolution of figure  [ fig : co ] would tend to be dominated by near side material ( given the typical scale height ) , and the anticorrelation with the x - rays implies that such is probably the case here .",
    "figure  [ fig : co]b displays apparent x - ray shadows cast by molecular gas at different velocities and distances . the y - shaped shadow extending above the plane near _",
    "@xmath34 10.5@xmath35 is perhaps the most notable , both because of its detailed match to the co and the relatively high velocity ( @xmath36 km s@xmath9 ) and distance ( 3.9 @xmath37 0.7 kpc ) of the absorbing gas ; this same vertical structure is even partially seen in the 30  45 km s@xmath9 map ( figure  [ fig : co]c ) .",
    "the clarity of this shadow might be due in part to its relatively high latitude , where confusion by background material at the far kinematic distance should be negligible .",
    "two other well - defined shadows are seen near _",
    "@xmath34 8.6@xmath35 , and are also well displaced from the plane : one at _ b _ @xmath34 0.5@xmath35 and the other at _ b _",
    "@xmath34 0.7@xmath35 .",
    "both features have gas velocities near 18 km s@xmath9 , corresponding to a near kinematic distance of 3.1 @xmath37 0.5 kpc .",
    "the most notable exception to the general anticorrelation seen in figure  [ fig : co ] is the region near ( _ l , b _",
    "@xmath34 11.25@xmath35 , 0.5@xmath35 ) , which is very bright in x - rays yet shows relatively strong co emission at distances greater than 3.9 kpc ( figures  [ fig : co]c ) .",
    "the bulk of these x - rays most likely arise from a foreground diffuse x - ray emission feature .    in the regions where the absorption is clear , ( @xmath38 ) , ( @xmath39 ) , and ( @xmath40 ) ( see figure  [ fig : co]b ) , the h@xmath41 column density for the molecular gas is estimated to be @xmath42  @xmath8 by applying a co - h@xmath41 conversion factor @xmath43 = 2 @xmath44 10@xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this large molecular column density indicates that the molecular gas in these directions is optically thick for the 0.52.0  kev x - rays ( i.e. in the @xmath3 kev band 1 optical depth is @xmath342.7@xmath4410@xmath47 @xmath8 and @xmath344@xmath4410@xmath47 @xmath8 in the 1.5 kev band assuming the theoretical cross section of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) and a 10@xmath48k thermal plasma . )",
    "it is therefore possible to directly extract the on - cloud and off - cloud x - ray intensities in order to estimate the foreground and distant fractions of the observed x - ray flux rather than fitting the standard two - component absorption model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the on - cloud x - ray emission is derived from a 1200 arcmin@xmath49 extraction region centered on ( @xmath38 ) , a 600 arcmin@xmath49 extraction region centered on ( @xmath39 ) , and a 300 arcmin@xmath49 extraction region centered on ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the range of on - cloud x - ray intensity in the @xmath3  kev  band from these 3 regions is 53 ",
    "57 @xmath44 10@xmath50  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 , while the 1.5  kev band intensity is @xmath34",
    "@xmath52  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 in all three regions .",
    "several regions with i@xmath53  k km s@xmath9 ( i.e. , h@xmath54 density @xmath55 5 @xmath44 10@xmath47 @xmath8 ) were selected to estimate the off - cloud x - ray intensities in the field : a 750 arcmin@xmath49 region centered on ( @xmath56 ) , a 400 arcmin@xmath49 region centered on ( @xmath57 ) , a 600 arcmin@xmath49 region centered on ( @xmath58 ) , and a 375 arcmin@xmath49 region centered on ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the brightest regions ( i.e. , ( _ l , b _ @xmath34 11.5@xmath35 , 0.5@xmath35 ) and ( _ l , b _",
    "@xmath34 9.3@xmath35 , 1.0@xmath35 ) ) were excluded to avoid contamination by possible discrete x - ray emission features .",
    "the off - cloud x - ray intensities , the sum of foreground and distant emission , lie in the range @xmath60  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 in the @xmath3  kev  band and @xmath61  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 in the 1.5  kev band . the observed on - cloud and average off - cloud x - ray intensities for this field of view are summarized in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] .",
    "the off - cloud x - ray intensities are consistent with the range of @xmath1  kev all - sky survey values ( @xcite ) in the first quadrant of the galactic plane .",
    "the average on - cloud to off - cloud x - ray intensity ratio in the @xmath3  kev  band is @xmath62 , which implies that @xmath63% of the observed x - ray flux in this band originates behind the molecular cloud . given the probable large x - ray absorption optical depth foreground to the cloud region ( @xmath64 , assuming an average space density of @xmath4  h  i  @xmath5 in the midplane ( @xcite ) and a distance of @xmath65  kpc ) a bright background emission region is implied : @xmath66  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 even assuming no additional absorption between the cloud and the distant emission region .",
    "this value is roughly an order of magnitude greater than the nominal high - latitude intensity ( @xmath67  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 ) .",
    "this emission is consistent with the extrapolation to the plane of the high x - ray intensities seen above and below the plane ( interpreted as a galactic x - ray bulge by snowden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) in this direction .",
    "the average on - cloud to off - cloud x - ray flux ratio in the 1.5  kev band of @xmath68 is nearly the same as that for the @xmath3  kev  band , and the foreground optical depth is @xmath69 ( assuming 1 optical depth @xmath344 @xmath44 10@xmath47 @xmath8 ) .",
    "the interpretation is the same as for the @xmath3  kev  band shadow , that there is a strong enhancement in the filling factor of x - ray emitting gas in the galactic plane beyond @xmath65  kpc in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "the implied background emission , again with no additional absorption , is @xmath70  counts  s@xmath9  arcmin@xmath51 .",
    "the deabsorbed 1.5  kev to @xmath3  kev  band ratio for the distant emission , @xmath71 , suggests a thermal emission temperature of @xmath72  k. this is again consistent with the galactic x - ray bulge of snowden et al .",
    "we have presented and discussed the implications of the deep @xmath1  kev band x - ray shadows in the galactic plane cast by dense inner - galaxy molecular gas toward _",
    "@xmath34 10@xmath35 .",
    "the striking result that half of the observed intensity originates beyond an optical depth of 2.33.4 requires that the emitting gas is non - uniformly distributed in the galactic disk and has a strong enhancement near the galactic center .",
    "its existence is also consistent with the extrapolation to the plane of the emission from a probable galactic x - ray bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "while some of the emission responsible for the foreground component could arise in the nearby ( @xmath73  pc with a @xmath74  pc radius ) sco - cen bubble , a part of this emission in all likelihood originates from another source component or superposition of multiple components which may be distributed over the @xmath65  kpc to the molecular gas .",
    "this additional component(s ) presumably contributes as well to the observed nonzero flux along the galactic plane observed in the anticenter direction where any extragalactic emission is still completely absorbed .",
    "further analysis of additional shadowing targets will help clarify the situation .",
    "the authors would like to thank jay lockman for helpful discussion and direction and the referee dan mccammon for his thoughtful review of this paper .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa - goddard space flight center and was supported in part by nasa grant nag 5 - 2492 and the purdue research foundation .",
