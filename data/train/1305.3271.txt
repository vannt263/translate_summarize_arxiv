    "until recently , most measurements of the day - side emission of hot jupiters have relied on targeting the secondary eclipses of these planets .",
    "typically , these studies have focused on the thermal emission in the near- and mid - infrared using the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( e.g. review by  @xcite  @xcite ) as well as ground - based telescopes ( e.g.  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "however , such observations only permit indirect measurements of the albedo and the day - night contrast of exoplanets  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "phase curve measurements with _ spitzer _ , on the other hand , have provided direct measurements of the day - night contrasts  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus the temperature difference between the two hemispheres , and have shown that the hottest spot in the planet s atmosphere could be offset from sub - stellar point  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ at optical wavelengths , reflected light could account for a significant fraction of a planet s light curve .",
    "moreover , since the planet - to - star contrast is much lower in the optical regime , contributions from ellipsoidal variations and doppler boosting also become important .",
    "both these effects provide information on the planet - to - star mass ratio .",
    "ellipsoidal variations stem from changes in the star s light due to tides raised by the planet , while doppler boosting results from the reflex motion ( @xmath5 ) of the star .",
    "so far , optical phase curves of only a handful planets have been presented in the literature : corot-1b  @xcite , hat - p-7b ( e.g.  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , koi-13 ( e.g.  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , tres-2b ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , and kepler 41  @xcite . + the _ kepler _ space telescope monitors over 150,000 stars , and so far the _ kepler _ team has publicly released fifteen quarters of data , acquired over three years of continuous observations .",
    "the majority of stars only have long - cadence ( lc ) measurements , with a sampling rate of 29.425 minutes , while a small fraction also have short - cadence ( sc ) observations , with a sampling rate of 58.85 seconds  @xcite .",
    "+ here we present the results of our analysis of the first fifteen quarters of _ kepler _ lc and sc data for eight objects ( kepler-5b , kepler-6b , kepler-8b , koi-13 , koi-64 , koi-2133 , tres-2b , hat - p-7b ) that exhibit phase variations . in section  [ sec : data ]",
    "we present the dataset and our analysis method , while in section  [ sec : analysis ] we present our model to fit the data .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : res ] , and finally we provide the conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "after correcting for systematics ( see sec .  [ sec : sys ] below ) , we visually inspected the phase curves of all publicly released kepler planetary candidates and confirmed planets that have a semi - major axis to stellar radius ( @xmath6 ) ratio of less than 10 .",
    "of these , we found 8 systems ( kepler-5 , kepler-6 , kepler-8 , koi-13 , koi-64 , koi-2133 , tres-2 and hat - p-7 ) that , after the removal of systematics , exhibited an apparent phase curve signal .",
    "+      in our analysis , we used both the _ kepler _ lc and sc simple aperture photometry ( sap ) data available ( see table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "instrumental signals were removed by performing a linear least squares fit of the first eight cotrending basis vectors ( cbvs )  @xcite to the time - series of each quarter individually . before cotrending , we removed any bad data points flagged by _ kepler _ in the sap or cbv files and to prevent contamination we only fit the cbvs to the out - of - transit time - series .",
    "the fitted basis vectors were then divided out of the quarter , in order to preserve the amplitude of the physical signals of interest . since cbvs are only provided for the lc data , we interpolated onto the sc time - stamps using cubic splines .",
    "+    ._kepler _ quarters of data used in analysis [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : alb ]    if the phase function is composed solely of reflected light the planet s albedo can be described by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the geometric albedo . based on the eclipse depth and assuming that there is no contribution from thermal emission , we calculate an albedo of less than 1 for all planets , except koi-2133 ( see tables  [ tab : res1]-[tab : res2 ] ) .",
    "we consider this strong evidence for koi-2133 being a self - luminous object and most likely not a planet .",
    "we note that the albedo calculated in this way should be considered as an upper - limit , since for all these objects thermal emission can contribute significantly ( see below ) .",
    "+ previous observations of hot jupiters indicate low albedos at optical wavelengths ( e.g.  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite for an ensemble of planets ) , consistent with theoretical models ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "+ the albedo plays a direct role in the planet s equilibrium temperature , @xmath9 , which can be calculated using the method of  @xcite as @xmath10^{1/4 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the bond albedo , which , if we assume lambert s law , we can be defined as @xmath12 .",
    "the re - radiation factor , @xmath13 , has two extremes , @xmath13=1/4 , corresponding to homogeneous re - distribution of energy across the planet , and , @xmath13=2/3 , for instant re - radiation from the day - side , resulting in a very hot day - side and cold night - side .",
    "although these two limiting cases are useful when calculating the equilibrium temperature , the true @xmath13 lies somewhere in between .",
    "the equilibrium temperature can be compared to the brightness temperature @xmath14 , the temperature of a black - body with the equivalent flux in the band - pass , which can be calculated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the planck function as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : dopp ] .",
    "this provides us with the brightness temperature of the planet s day - side .",
    "in addition , if we change @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the flux from the planet s night - side , we can calculate the night - side brightness temperature @xmath22 .",
    "+ in the case of isothermal atmospheric emission , we would expect that @xmath17 fall somewhere between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and that @xmath25 be less than @xmath23 .",
    "however , we find that for all planets , except tres-2 , the brightness temperature is actually greater than maximum equilibrium temperature and that , for tres-2 , koi-64 and koi-2133 , the night - side temperature is greater than the homogeneous equilibrium temperature ( see tables  [ tab : res1]-[tab : res2 ] ) . + for koi-2133 , this , along with having an albedo @xmath11 , implies that is almost certainly a self - luminous object . for koi-64 ,",
    "the very large discrepancy between the night - side and equilibrium temperature also suggests that it is most - likely self - luminous and not a planet . for tres-2 ,",
    "the 1.2@xmath26 difference is not significant , and can easily arise if the layers probed at optical wavelengths are at a higher temperature than the equilibrium temperature .",
    "+ since koi-13 and hat - p-7 have a significant night - side flux detection , consistent with their homogeneous temperature , we can place a constraint on their maximum allowed albedo .",
    "this is calculated by assuming a uniform temperature across the planet s surface ( @xmath13=1/4 ) equal to the night - side temperature derived from @xmath21 . for koi-13 and hat - p-7",
    ", we find a maximum albedo of 0.26 and 0.148 , respectively .",
    "+ in general , the eclipse depths at optical wavelengths are likely a combination of reflected light and thermal emission . to investigate this we self - consistently solve for the eclipse depth as a function of @xmath8 using @xmath27 where we assume that @xmath28=@xmath29 as given in eq.16 . in the limit of @xmath13=1/4 ( uniform temperature )",
    "this will provide an upper limit on @xmath8 and a lower limit on @xmath28 . while if @xmath13=2/3 , we will obtain the opposite .",
    "we find that for all planets , except koi-2133 , there is a physical solution that satisfies these equations ( see table  [ sec : alb ] ) and that all , except koi-64 , have albedos less than 0.3 .",
    "+ for koi-13 , if we assume a homogeneous heat distribution , an albedo of , at most , 0.148 is needed to produce the observed night - side flux . using this albedo limit",
    ", we calculate an expected day - side flux significantly lower than the observed day - side flux . however , this would not be a problem in the case where the emitting layers probed in the _ kepler _ bandpass , are hotter than the equilibrium temperature , as inferred for corot-2  @xcite . for tres-2 ,",
    "this is most - likely also the case .",
    "we have presented new phase curves for five _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kepler-5 , kepler-6 , kepler-8 , koi-64 and koi-2133 ) and re - examined the phase curves of tres-2 , hat - p-7 and koi-13 using 15 quarters of _ kepler _ data . + the fitted and derived parameters , for each of these systems , can be found in tables  [ tab : res1]-[tab : res2 ] .",
    "the derived ellipsoidal masses of kepler-5 , kepler-6 , kepler-8 , tres-2 and hat - p-7 are within 3@xmath26 , of their published radial velocity measurements , while the derived doppler mass for tres-2 and hat - p-7 is within 1@xmath26 and 9@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "when we compared the ellipsoidal and doppler amplitudes of hat - p-7 and koi-13 to five previous studies that listed uncertainty values , we found that our results were within 3@xmath26 , while our values for tres-2 agreed with its two previous phase curve studies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] ) . + our secondary eclipse and phase function values of kepler-5 , kepler-8 , koi-64 , tres-2 agree with previous studies , while four of the six previous studies of hat - p-7 are within 4@xmath26 of our values .",
    "in addition , our eclipse depth for koi-13 is within 4@xmath26 , to three previous studies , but our phase function amplitude differs greatly , partly due to contamination from koi-13 s companion .",
    "a previous study of kepler-6 found an eclipse depth more than double our value , however a different number of observations and systematic removal method was used ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : alb ] ) . + for koi-13 , in addition to the phase curve components described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we measure an out - of - phase third cosine harmonic with an amplitude of @xmath3 ppm .",
    "we believe that this signal could be a perturbation of koi-13 s ellipsoidal variations caused by it s spin - orbit misalignment . + for koi-64 and koi-2133 , we derived planet masses , from ellipsoidal variations and doppler boosting , of less than 6 @xmath30 .",
    "however , we found that their day- and night - side temperatures were much higher than their equilibrium temperatures and therefore they must be self - luminous objects .",
    "we conclude that koi-64 and koi-2133 are false - positives created by an eclipsing binary diluted by a third stellar companion or a fore- or background star within the same _ kepler _ pixel .",
    "+ for the rest of the objects , we find albedos of less than 0.3 , but conclude that for tres-2 and koi-13 it is likely that the atmospheric layers probed in the kepler bandpass , are hotter than the equilibrium temperature , as inferred for corot-2  @xcite .",
