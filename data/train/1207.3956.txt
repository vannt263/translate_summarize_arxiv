    "during the last 2  3 decades , observations from space combined with ground - based data , as well as state - of - the - art , post - processing reconstruction techniques combined with progress in numerical modelling and theory have increased our understanding of the physical processes occurring in the solar atmosphere . apart from demonstrating that the solar atmosphere is highly dynamic and inhomogeneous",
    "these studies have also provided a deep insight into all phenomena occurring in its different parts .",
    "they have revealed a number of different types of structures that exist in the different atmospheric layers for which a range of formation mechanisms have to be investigated .",
    "they have also provided important information about the physical conditions of the emitting plasma , as well as hints about the physical nature of related dynamic phenomena which continuously occur on the sun over a large range of spatial and temporal scales .",
    "the solar chromosphere is an intricately structured and dynamic layer of the sun .",
    "it is traditionally defined as the layer , about 2000  thick , lying between the photosphere and the transition region and has long been known not to be in hydrostatic equilibrium . therefore , its nature is that of dynamic fine - scale structures which uniquely characterize this part of the solar atmosphere .",
    "these appear to be structured by the magnetic fields that extend from network boundaries and plages and be directly related to its evolution .",
    "the appearance of the underlying atmosphere is , mainly , due to processes involving the emergence , buffeting and re - arrangement of the magnetic flux generated by interior dynamo action .",
    "the resulting spatial inhomogeneity produces a fruitful environment for the emerging fluxes to undergo quite complex changes as they dynamically evolve and interact with the pre - existing magnetic fields in the ambient medium .",
    "complex and concentrated , mainly unipolar , strong magnetic fields produce the so - called active regions , which are the locations of some jet - like structures , such as the ( traditional ) fibrils and dynamic fibrils ( dfs ) .",
    "outside active regions , what is generally known as the quiet solar chromosphere , is not really quiet .",
    "it is continually subject to a variety of small - scale events , such as mottles , straws and the , recently reported , rapid blue excursions , occurring at the boundaries of cellular patterns that constitute the magnetic network .",
    "the magnetic network is believed to be sustained by magnetic bipoles , which emerge in the interiors of supergranules , move apart and are fragmented by granular buffeting .",
    "eventually , the fragments are driven to the supergarnular boundaries where they interact with the existing magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "opposite polarity fluxes cancel and submerge , whereas like - polarity flux merges to form larger flux concentrations .",
    "when observing the chromosphere at different wavelengths , from the euv to the radio domain its very large range of inhomogeneity and structuring is revealed .",
    "chromospheric structures can be seen against the solar disk , by means of monochromatic or narrow - band filters or spectrometers operating in strong spectral lines , such as @xmath0 , caii  h & k , and the caii  infrared triplet ( ir ) . in particular , filtergrams recorded in the wings and line center of @xmath0  reveal a wealth of fine - scale structures .",
    "the most prominent small - scale features residing at the network boundaries are certainly mottles .",
    "mottles are thin jet - like features , better observed in @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite identified in caii  h images taken close to the solar limb as very thin and short - lived bright structures which occur in `` hedge rows '' .",
    "he called them `` straws '' .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite found sudden , large line shift changes in both @xmath0  and caii  ir lines on their blue side .",
    "the authors interpreted these events , which occur at the edges of rosettes ( cluster of mottles expanding radially around a common center ) , as chromospheric up - flows and called them `` rapid blue - shifted excursions '' ( rbes ) . in active regions ,",
    "a subset of dark structures called fibrils includes relatively short , thin , jet - like structures called dynamic fibrils ( dfs ) .",
    "they are found in the central area of plages where the magnetic field is more dense , and more vertically oriented .",
    "another large subset includes very inclined , almost horizontal , long fibrils which are clearly more stable than the dfs .",
    "the relationship between all these on - disk structures , as well as their relationship to spicules , thin , elongated , jet - like structures observed at the solar limb , is under strong debate .",
    "spicules are the most obvious component of the chromospheric limb . although they were discovered almost 130 years ago",
    ", they still remain one of the mysterious phenomena in the solar atmosphere because , at least until recently , remained very close to the resolution limits of current solar observations .",
    "as a result , several of their properties have not been well defined and this has led to a plethora of theoretical models for their interpretation ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , with its high resolution and high cadence , as well as an uninterrupted view of the sun , the hinode space mission provided a new picture of spicules .",
    "@xcite , based on time series observations of the solar limb taken with solar optical telescope ( sot ) aboard hinode in the caii  h broad filter , suggested that spicules can be grouped in two categories , called type i and type ii , which seem to have different properties and formation mechanisms .",
    "the origin of short duration / high velocity spicules ( type ii ) has been attributed to magnetic field reconnection . on the other hand",
    ", the origin of type i , classic spicules ( long duration / low velocities ) seems to be associated with the leakage of p - modes into the upper atmosphere and subsequent development of shocks that follow the magnetic field lines .    while spicules are ubiquitous at the limb , there is still a debate on the issue of their counterparts are on the solar disk .",
    "@xcite concluded from the different velocity distributions of mottles and spicules , that mottles are not the disk counterparts of ( classical ) spicules .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , based on the similarity of their physical parameters , argued for a close relationship between them .",
    "type i spicules appear to rise up from the limb and fall back again .",
    "they show a similar dynamical behaviour as active region dfs @xcite , as well as a subset of mottles .",
    "type ii spicules , on the other hand , seem to exhibit an upward motion followed by rapid fading from the hinode caii  h passband , although more recent work by @xcite , were unable to locate any type ii spicules .",
    "@xcite suggested that the disk counterpart of type ii spicules are rbes based on the similarities of their properties .",
    "when observed in the line center of @xmath0 , the chromospheric plasma is clearly seen to be organized along fine - scale magnetic structures which have different inclinations .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite using high - resolution @xmath0  observations together with magnetograms obtained with the spectropolarimeter on hinode , revealed through a potential magnetic field extrapolation another very important aspect of these structures when observed on the disk .",
    "they showed that magnetic flux tubes following the local inclination of the magnetic field lines , define the layer of the magnetic canopy , i.e. the plasma-@xmath1 layer , where the plasma-@xmath2 is the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure .",
    "it is at this layer , where acoustic waves generated by the convective motions , undergo mode conversion , refraction , reflection and transmission with important effects to the upper solar atmosphere and thus these structures play a very important role in wave propagation .",
    "the fact that the solar corona has a temperature more than 1 million degrees is still a puzzling problem of solar physics , despite the considerable theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "since the energy release in the largest explosive events ( flares and microflares ) does not supply enough power to heat the corona , the behaviour of smaller - scale and less energetic , but much more frequent events is an essential constituent of the problem @xcite .",
    "both magnetic reconnection and waves related to spicules are powerful mechanisms for energy release and transfer and have been considered as heating agents of the solar corona . @xcite and @xcite examining the temporal evolution of the line - of - sight velocity of mottles found bi - directional flows and proposed a model according to which spicules are due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "@xcite showed that if magnetic reconnection is considered as the driving mechanism of mottles , the material they supply to the solar corona is in excess of that needed to compensate for coronal mass losses in the solar wind , while the amount of energy released to heat the corona depends on several parameters , among which are the number of the events , their axial velocity and magnetic field , etc . , and can be negligible or substantial .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , showed that the energy flux provided by the alfvn waves identified in spicules is large enough to supply the energy necessary to heat the quiet solar corona and drive the solar wind .",
    "thus the question arises of how these small - scale features participate and contribute into the larger scale observable phenomena , and how a more accurate determination of the physical parameters , which are related to the physical processes , can be extracted from observations .",
    "this review is the first part of a series of four reviews .",
    "the aim of these reviews is to present an overview of our current understanding ( observations , modelling , physical parameters , etc . ) of solar small - scale , jet - like structures observed both on the disk and at the limb , in active , as well as in quiet regions . in this review ( part i ) we present an overview of the chromospheric fine - scale structures .",
    "more specifically , we will present their morphological properties , their derived physical parameters , such as height , width , lifetime , velocities , etc .",
    ", as well as methods used for the derivation of some of them , their dynamical behaviour , and comment on their interrelationship . in subsequent papers we will discuss transition region small - scale events ( part ii ) , and the role of the various small - scale events in coronal heating ( part iii ) .",
    "the solar surface is threaded by a complex network of magnetic fields .",
    "observations of these fields at the photospheric level reveal them to be concentrated into regions of mixed ( negative and positive ) polarities covering a wide range of values for the ( unsigned ) magnetic flux and lifetimes . in _",
    "quiet areas _ the dynamic interplay between the magnetic field concentrations and the plasma has been called the sun s `` magnetic carpet '' @xcite . in these areas ,",
    "photospheric motions are dominated by the flow pattern of large convective cells called supergranules .",
    "these cells range in diameter from roughly 10000  to 50000 , with an average diameter of between 13000 and 18000  @xcite .",
    "their flow pattern takes the form of an up - flow at the cell center , followed by radial outflow of @xmath30.5 , and down - flow at the cell boundaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an upper limit of 0.1  for the magnitude of the supergranule s vertical velocity ( both up - flow and down - flow ) . the strongest down - flow occurring at points where two or more cells meet , and as a result , the magnetic flux tends to build up along the boundaries of supergranular cells after being swept from the center by the radial outflow .",
    "it is now well established from investigations of high resolution magnetograms that new bipolar elements emerge continuously inside the cell interiors and are , subsequently , swept by the supergranular flow at the periphery of supergranular cells where they gather and form the network boundaries with kg field strengths @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated well by the soho / mdi magnetogram shown in figure  [ mdi ] .",
    "the supergranule cell boundaries are marked in yellow , and it can be seen that the majority of the flux concentrations are located along these lines , and in particular at the intersection of multiple cells .",
    "these concentrations called _ network concentrations _ are typically found at sites of strong down - flow , at the boundaries of supergranular cells @xcite .",
    "their fluxes are of the order of 10@xmath4  10@xmath5mx and have typical diameters of 1000  10000@xcite .",
    "they tend to be larger than _ ephemeral regions _ which are clumps of newly emerged flux of varying strengths with total net flux equal to zero .",
    "ephemeral regions emerge preferentially near supergranular boundaries , without influencing the flow pattern .",
    "after emergence , they most often fragment into several concentrations where their flux quickly merges into the pre - existing network . @xcite give the average flux of an ephemeral region to be @xmath3 1.3@xmath610@xmath5mx .",
    "@xcite determined that the network concentrations are produced from the residuals of other flux concentrations .",
    "it is estimated that 90% or more of their flux originates from ephemeral regions , with the remaining 10% being contributed by _",
    "intranetwork fields_. _ intranetwork ( in ) fields _ are the smallest of the three types of small - scale magnetic flux concentrations .",
    "they typically last 2 to 4 hours .",
    "their mean diameter is about 2000 , while their total flux content ( @xmath3 10@xmath7mx ) tends to be close to the detection limit of present instruments .",
    "they emerge within supergranule cells due to the emergence of small bipolar pairs .",
    "they are then swept towards the cell boundaries by radial flows , where they interact with network fields @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite using observations obtained with solar optical telescope spectropolarimeter ( sot / sp ) on board the hinode spacecraft presented clear evidence of an emerging in magnetic loop showing strong horizontal magnetic signal and traces of vertical opposite polarities on each side of it .",
    "the lower parts of the loop were advected into the intergranular lanes , where they aggregate to other magnetic field concentrations resulting in larger flux elements .",
    "@xcite based on the high spatial resolution and polarimetric sensitivity of the sot / sp reported the existence of horizontal magnetic fields in the in regions whose mean field strength surpasses considerably that of the vertical component .",
    "the vertical fields are concentrated in the intergranular lanes , whereas the stronger horizontal fields occur preferentially at the edges of the bright granules or inside them aside from the vertical fields .",
    "this kind of spatial relation between the horizontal and the vertical magnetic fields suggests that the in field consists of small @xmath8 loops having their vertical roots in the intergranular lanes and connected by an horizontal field above granules .    from the previous discussion it becomes clear that the magnetic flux patches within the magnetic carpet , while diffusing along the superganular boundaries due to supergranular flows , interact with one another by the following four main processes : flux _ emergence _ which is the appearance in pairs or in clusters of new magnetic flux ( with equal amounts of flux in both the positive and negative polarities ) .",
    "_ cancellation _ which occurs when concentrations of opposite polarity come into contact and mutually lose flux @xcite .",
    "if two or more concentrations of the same polarity merge together to form a single larger concentration , this is known as _",
    "coalescence_. finally , _ fragmentation _ which is the splitting of a large concentration of flux into several different smaller concentrations . using a series of full - disc 96 minute mdi magnetograms",
    ", @xcite found that the time taken for all flux within the quiet sun photosphere to be replaced ( `` the flux replacement timescale '' ) was around 14 hours .",
    "however , later studies determined this value to be an order of magnitude smaller , at just 1  2 hours @xcite .",
    "the magnetic network formed by the driving of the magnetic flux to the boundaries of supergranules is made up of clusters of kilogauss flux tubes . by definition",
    "the smallest observable structure of the magnetic flux in the photosphere are magnetic elements which have various field strengths and diameters close to or less than the best currently achievable spatial resolution ( @xmath3 150 ) .",
    "magnetic elements are very important because they not only structure the photosphere but also provide a link to the chromosphere and corona along which energy can be transported from the sun s interior to the outer layers .",
    "they were first observed as `` magnetic knots '' @xcite  small dark structures equivalent to what we now call `` micropores '' @xcite and as `` filigree '' , elongated chains of bright points @xcite which have been resolved into strings of adjacent bright points by @xcite . when observed at disc center",
    "they are usually best seen in the `` g - band filtergrams '' , which are obtained with a wide - band filter centered around 430.5 nm , named g - band by fraunhofer .",
    "the first observations of the network at this wavelength window were carried out by @xcite .",
    "the name `` network bright points '' ( nbps ) was introduced @xcite for the bright grains which are visible in filtergrams and are arranged in roughly cellular patterns making up the network boundaries . since bright points have been presumed to be the visible manifestation of thin magnetic flux tubes and thus related to the magnetic elements , extensive work has been initiated and it is now well established that nbps are brightness manifestations of the small , strong field magnetic elements that make up the magnetic network @xcite .    in _ stronger field areas",
    "_ , on the other hand , the increased number density of magnetic flux tubes gives rise to large chromospheric areas called plages which consist of many bright elements ( sometimes referred to as facular granules ) packed together .",
    "granules near network bright points and in plage regions are smaller , display slower temporal evolution and have a lower contrast than those found in quiet areas @xcite .",
    "the granular pattern in these areas is referred too as `` abnormal '' @xcite .",
    "flux concentrations take on structure , behave less passively and seem to affect the granular flow .",
    "the larger magnetic filling factor in plage regions gives rise to large amorphous , elongated `` ribbons '' that contain high net flux .",
    "they are characterized by large flux concentrations having a brighter edge and an intensity depression in the center .",
    "the majority of them are not resolved into flux tubes , but instead show a substructure which is interpreted as an indication of a range of magnetic field strengths within the structure .",
    "circular manifestations of spread out ribbon structures have been called `` flowers '' .",
    "the `` flowers '' and `` ribbons '' are small flux concentrations @xcite , while larger flux concentrations are called ( micro)-pores and have a distinct dark center .",
    "there is a continuous transition between these features evolving from one to another depending on the amount of the magnetic flux that is collected or dispersed .",
    "the merging and splitting of `` flux sheets '' , which are concentrations of the magnetic field due to the granular flow , and the transitions between the ribbons , flowers , and micropores are described by @xcite .",
    "these authors found also that the plasma is basically at rest in these structures with small concentrations of weak up - flow sites , while narrow sheets with down - drafts are found right at the edges of the magnetic field concentrations .    due to the continual motion of mixed polarity concentrations in the magnetic carpet and the different flux evolution processes , the quiet sun photosphere",
    "is highly dynamic . since magnetic fields from the magnetic carpet",
    "extend up into the solar chromosphere and lower corona , it is expected that the quiet sun chromosphere and corona are also highly dynamic responding to the movement and evolution of the different flux concentrations .",
    "even more , the spatial distribution and rates of the different processes of flux evolution play a major role in determining the distribution of heating events in the upper solar layers .",
    "the driving of foot - points of the small - scale magnetic fields on the surface of the sun plays a fundamental role in sustaining the chromospheric network and leads to the build up of currents and/or the generation of waves , mechanisms considered as potential sources of energy for solving the coronal heating problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger magnetic filling factor in plage regions gives rise to more extended structures .",
    "as stated by @xcite , the merging and splitting of flux sheets and the continuous transition between ribbons and micropores , are difficult to reconcile with models that regard these structures as being composed of discrete flux tubes that keep their identity over a long period of time .",
    "they also suggested that it should be more appropriate to characterize the temporal behaviour of the magnetic field in these areas as fluid - like , where the `` magnetic fluid '' is in continuous interaction with the field - free plasma , forming the extended concentrations . due to the differences between quiet and active regions at the photospheric level described above",
    ", differences between the different underlying structures related to them should be expected .",
    "it should be made clear at this point that the aim of this section is not to give an extensive review on the solar photosphere and its magnetic structure , but rather to provide the background for the overlying chromosphere and its structures which is the main topic of this review .",
    "the interested reader can be referred to recent , more detailed reviews on the solar photosphere , like e.g. those by @xcite and @xcite .",

    ": @xmath0  line center .",
    "the left - hand one samples quiet network , the right - hand one more enhanced network ( figure courtesy of dr j. leenaarts , see also @xcite),scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "the photospheric magnetic fields of different forms and strengths extend through the chromosphere into the corona providing the link between the different solar layers .",
    "as stated in the previous section in the photospheric layers the supergranular flows carry the magnetic fields to the edges of the supergranular cells resulting in large magnetic flux concentrations .",
    "the magnetic flux tubes that constitute the magnetic network expand upwards and appear as bright patches that constitute the chromospheric network .",
    "a strong spatial coincidence exists between the photospheric magnetic network concentrations and the overlying network boundaries in the chromosphere . in caii",
    "h&k images , which sample the low chromosphere , nbps show up with a larger brightness enhancement over the surrounding area than they do in g - band ( cf fig . 2 of @xcite ) , but with lower sharpness due to strong resonance scattering and possibly also due to increasing flux tube width with height ( fig .",
    "[ mag_elem ] , upper row ) . also high resolution images taken in the blue wing of @xmath0",
    "were found to display strikingly intense small - scale brightenings at the locations where magnetic elements form the nbps ( fig .",
    "[ mag_elem ] , lower row , left ) .",
    "@xcite showed the potential of these @xmath0  bright points as proxies of the magnetic elements .",
    "the solar chromosphere being only about 2500 km thick ( @xmath33@xmath11 ) actually covers the layer where the solar atmosphere turns from the gas - dominated photosphere / lower chromosphere into the magnetic field dominated upper chromosphere / corona ( for recent reviews on the solar chromosphere , as well as to its coupling with the other solar layers the reader can be referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "chromospheric plasma , especially when seen in the center of the @xmath0  line , is very clearly organized along fine - scale , dark , elongated structures that span out from regions of enhanced magnetic flux .",
    "some of them are connected to neighbouring regions and others fading in between , while covering the in cells ( fig .",
    "[ mag_elem ] , lower row , right ) .",
    "such filamentary structures portray the magnetic field topology and are consistent with the increasing dominance of the magnetic pressure over the gas pressure with increasing heights in the atmosphere .",
    "this dominance has as a result the upward expansion of the magnetic fields which fill the space in the chromosphere and affect its dynamics .",
    "the relative importance of the pressures is given by the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure ( also referred to as the plasma-@xmath2 ) and is related to the formation of the magnetic canopy zone .",
    "this zone , in which @xmath12 1 and the sound speed equals the alfvn speed , separates the solar atmosphere into magnetic and non - magnetic regions and plays an important role in the refraction and reflection of the upward propagating waves , as well as in converting acoustic waves into other modes , such as fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves(see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown the important role the dark @xmath0  fine - scale magnetic structures play in the formation of the magnetic canopy ( for details see section [ canopy ] ) .",
    "as one goes from the @xmath0  line center to the wings , the picture gradually changes ( see lower left panel of fig .  [ mag_elem ] ) .",
    "it is , usually , suggested that in dark structures observed in the @xmath0  line wings the intensity is coming from lower layers than the core of the line , although it can not be excluded that it might come from highly doppler shifted features that are located higher in the atmosphere than the features observed in line center .",
    "the dark structures endings in the @xmath0  blue wing image ( fig .",
    "[ mag_elem ] , lower row , left )  which are part of the elongated mottles seen in @xmath0  line center- are likely to emanate from photospheric bright points which are concentrated into clusters .",
    "the relationship between the ends of the dark structures and the photospheric bright points is presented in section [ pbp ] .    from the above",
    "it becomes clear that the photosphere and chromosphere are coupled via magnetic fields and , furthermore , any description of the solar atmosphere in terms of average properties is incomplete without the consideration of the fine - scale structures and their dynamics .",
    "mottles , spicules , fibrils and dynamic fibrils , straws , rapid blue excursions ( rbes ) are some of the jet - like , fine - scale features that dominate the dynamic and highly - structured chromosphere .",
    "direct , narrow - band or broad - band filtergrams have provided the means for obtaining parameters such as lifetime , size , spatial distribution , inclination , etc .",
    ", of these structures .",
    "on the other hand , spectroscopic observations in different lines are essential to extend our knowledge on the physical conditions , particularly the temperature , density and flows .",
    "determination of the physical conditions in the observed features is also based on the study of the spatial and temporal variation of the observed radiation intensity in different wavelengths , i.e. line intensity or contrast profiles . on the basis of observational findings",
    "various theoretical models and numerical simulations have been developed to explain the mechanism responsible for their formation .",
    "however , in spite of the remarkable advances made by the high resolution observations and by the development of theories and numerical simulations , their interrelationship , the determination of their physical parameters , the definition of their formation mechanism , as well as their possible role in the heating of the solar corona still remain uncertain .",
    "ambiguities are mainly due to the differences in their appearance when observed in different spectral lines , but also at different wavelengths within the same line , to the different instruments used for their observation ( which usually have different spatial and temporal resolution ) , to the different methods used to infer their physical parameters , especially velocities , to their relatively short duration and rapid changes and , most important , to the different names used by different authors to describe the same structure",
    ".    below we present a description of the appearance and the physical properties of these structures .",
    "we follow the traditional terminology , as well as the recent one which has resulted from high resolution observations of some `` new '' ,  spicular - like \" structures .",
    "+        the traditional term `` spicule '' refers to the relatively thin , elongated jet - like structures , seen at the limb of the sun which appear as bright jet - like features against the dark background of the solar corona .",
    "the term was first used by @xcite , to describe jets which dominate the chromosphere seen at the limb shooting up to 10000  heights .",
    "spicule - like features , however , were first observed and described by father angelo secchi of the vatican observatory in 1877 @xcite . as first reported by @xcite ,",
    "spicules seem to show a group behavior , the so - called `` porcupine '' and `` wheat '' field patterns . in the former ,",
    "spicules seem to radiate outward from a common centre forming a 18 mm wide configuration along the solar limb , whereas in the latter all spicules seem to have the same orientation over a width of 140 mm .",
    "initially , spicules were associated with quiet sun regions at the limb , nowadays , however , it is believed that on - disc quiet sun structures called mottles constitute only a fraction of the observed off - limb spicules and that active region fibrils , as well as superpenubral fibrils are seen as spicules when these regions cross the limb ( see fig .  [ dot ] ) . despite their discovery over 130 years ago ,",
    "spicules are among the least understood phenomena of the solar chromosphere . until recently , this was due to the lack of high - resolution observations ( their diameters of a few hundred kilometers and lifetimes of a few minutes were close to the observational limits ) , as well as to the highly simplified and poorly constrained models used for their modelling .",
    "several recent advances not only on the observational side , but also on the modelling side have provided significant progress on the understanding of these structures .",
    "however , we still lack definitive answers on several of their physical properties and interrelationships with other limb and on - disk structures , while models still face difficulties in describing them accurately .",
    "@xcite give comprehensive reviews of early work on mottles and spicules , while a more recent review on the modelling of these structures is given by @xcite .",
    "the morphology and properties of spicules have been under study for the last sixty years although with rather limited interest after the early years of their characterization . only recently",
    ", the interest of the solar physicists on them has been revived by the fact that high resolution instruments are being used .",
    "high resolution movies in the caii  h line obtained with the broadband filter imager ( bfi ) of sot on the seeing - free hinode spacecraft have revealed a remarkably dynamic , spicule - dominated limb . based on some physical properties derived from sot / hinode caii  h observations",
    ", @xcite suggested that there exist two types of spicules : a ) `` type i '' spicules , similar to the traditional spicules , which appear to rise up from the limb and then fall back , to be long - lived ( 3  7min ) and to exhibit longitudinal motions of the order of 20  and b ) `` type ii '' spicules which seem to have much shorter lifetimes ( 50  100s ) , higher velocities ( @xmath3100 ) , to be considerably taller and to exhibit only upward motion and then rapidly disappear ( fig .  [ spic_i_ii ] ) .        in that work the authors following the time evolution of the intensity along a fixed cut almost perpendicular to the limb ( see fig .  [ spic_i_ii ] ) , they were able to show at least one clear example of a `` type i '' spicule which shows a distinctive different profile than the steep linear streaks caused by `` type ii '' spicules .",
    "however , since spicules are so dynamic and may move in and out of the fixed cut , such intensity profiles that cover the full time series can not be used to reliably measure the properties of spicules .",
    "thus the authors had to rely on spicules that did not move transversely so that their full life time could be covered by a fixed cut .",
    "quite recently , @xcite re - analyzing the same data sets adopted by @xcite identified and traced 105 and 102 spicules in quiet sun and coronal hole ( ch ) , respectively .",
    "they claimed that they could not find a single convincing example of `` type ii '' spicules .",
    "furthermore , they reported that more than 60% of the identified spicules in each region showed a complete cycle , i.e. , the majority are `` type i '' spicules .",
    "thirdly , the lifetimes of the spicules in the quiet sun and ch are 148 s and 112 s , respectively , but there is no fundamental lifetime difference between the spicules in the quiet sun and ch reported earlier . in the same paper of @xcite , the authors in order to reveal the two different populations applied two different filters to the time series .",
    "the first , low - frequency , filter was a gaussian centered on 3mhz with a width of 0.5mhz and brought out the `` type i '' spicules , i.e. the relatively slowly evolving features that typically move up and down during their lifetimes of order 3  7min .",
    "the second filter was designed as a combination of a high - pass filter ( @xmath1315mhz ) with a low - pass filter placed at a frequency which is 2mhz lower than the nyquist frequency of the time series studied .",
    "this filtering isolates the longer lived type i spicules from the more dynamic , type ii , spicules which appear and disappear on very short time scales .",

    "the upward motion is usually fairly regular and continuous , the spicule rising and stopping abruptly at its maximum height .",
    "subsequently , the spicule may either fade from visibility or else descend back to the low chromosphere with a velocity comparable to that of its initial ascent . measurements of vertical proper motions were made in the 1950 s and 1960 s by @xcite and @xcite , and have been reviewed by @xcite and @xcite . in an old work , @xcite , after studying the apparent motions of spicules , reported that in half of them the ascending phase is followed by a descending one , while the other half is fading away ; she was also the first to report that some spicules appear to rise from the same source several times .",
    "the majority of descending spicules appear to retrace their original paths , but according to @xcite there are many which fall back along different paths , often forming an arch .",
    "@xcite combining the observations of @xcite and @xcite , which gave the variation of height with time of spicules , constructed the observed distribution of apparent velocities relating them to the angular distribution of spicules obtained from their axial velocity distribution ( fig .",

    "they give as the most probable velocity 20  and a range between 0  and 60 .",

    "thus he found an absolute average value of the los velocity of 6.4  for @xmath0 , 5.6  for @xmath32  and 4.9  for caii  k. using this technique @xcite measured the los velocity component of 90 well  isolated spicules at 50006000  above the limb . to improve the statistics they have also added some other available distributions ( see their table i ) . relating the measured doppler velocity distribution ( which was approximately symmetric ranging between -30 to 30 ) with the angular distribution of inclinations they obtained as a most probable axial velocity 40(fig .",
    "[ axial_velo ] , right ) , i.e. about 20  larger than the most probable apparent upward velocity .",
    "recently @xcite measured los velocities from doppler shifts of the tops of spicules found at their maximum heights ( fig .",
    "[ appar_velo ] , right ) .",
    "the doppler shifts were calculated by fitting gaussians to 5wavelength @xmath0  spectra .",
    "they reported a mean absolute value of 5.1@xmath205.1 , a median of 3.8  and a range of 0.3 to 30.2 .",
    "this value agrees with the mean value of 6  quoted by @xcite .",
    "they also found that the distribution of the los velocities at the bases of the 40 spicules measured ( where the base is defined as the location of the apparent limb ) has a mean of 3.1@xmath2011.9  and a range of @xmath1017.8 to 51.2 .",
    "as noted from their doppler measurements , they regularly found oppositely directed motions , i.e. bi  directional , which could be an indication of magnetic reconnection .",
    "one has to bear in mind , however , that whereas photographic observations give the vertical velocity of the spicules in the plane of the limb , spectroscopic observations give the velocity component along the los and , hence , in the direction normal to the plane of the limb .",
    "this fact can explain the discrepancy between the average apparent vertical velocity value of 25  and an average value of @xmath3 6obtained for the los velocity of spicules .",
    "following @xcite , one can show that the magnitude of the average doppler velocity of spicules lying in a cone whose axis is normal to the los and whose apex angle is 2@xmath35 ( see fig .  [ geometry ] ) is given by the formula :    @xmath36     of a spicule along the los .",
    "@xmath37 is the los component , @xmath2 is the angle made by the spicule with the solar radius , and @xmath38 is the azimuthal angle of the projection of the spicule velocity vector onto a plane tangent to the limb ( from @xcite),scaledwidth=70.0% ]    where @xmath38 is the azimuthal angle of the projection of the spicule velocity vector onto a plane tangent to the limb . at greater heights , the observed doppler shifts will be positive or negative depending on whether the spicule is inclined away from or towards the observer .",
    "thus for @xmath39=25  and @xmath35=30  we get 8  for the average los velocity of spicules , which is close to the value reported from observations .",
    "@xcite , as stated above , found a large difference ( @xmath3 20 ) between the maxima of the distributions of the axial velocities deduced from the measurements of the apparent and doppler velocities of spicules . as they anticipated",
    "this difference is presumably due to the ionization of the hydrogen atoms , when the spicules , penetrating the corona , are heated .",
    "thus if a partially ionized plasma parcel is moving along the axis of a spicule with a velocity of @xmath3 40  and at the same time its front is being ionized and an ionization wave is moving backwards with a velocity of @xmath3 20  then the apparent velocity would be equal to 20 .",
    "they also noted , however , that the differences in the obtained values may also be due to the fact that the data they used for their calculations were taken at different periods of the solar cycle , at different locations on the sun , with different instruments and with different techniques .",
    "the height dependence of the los velocity in spicules has also been investigated by several authors .",
    "the results obtained differ significantly from each other .",
    "for instance , @xcite has found that the doppler shift decreases along the spicule , @xcite found an increase of the doppler shift with height , while @xcite reported a weak or even no observable change of the shift with height .",
    "the main reason for these discrepancies are due to the fact that observations of spicules at various heights simultaneously are related to instrumental difficulties .",
    "@xcite studied almost simultaneously height sequences of 69 spicules in the @xmath0  line .",
    "he claimed that absolute values of los velocities increase linearly with height and that no variation of the sign of the los velocity along individual spicules is observed .",
    "it is quite evident that spicule motions and their time variations are essential in clarifying the mechanism responsible for their formation .",
    "however , reported time variations of doppler shifts are contradictory .",
    "@xcite reported that the doppler shift of spicules increases progressively with time , goes through a maximum and then decreases , but it does not change sign , being always upwards .",
    "@xcite found that doppler velocities of a certain number of spicules do undergo quasi - periodic reversals .",
    "recently , @xcite , in a study of spicules observed in several euv lines by sumer on soho , reported strong red and blue shifts within a feature , which , furthermore , reverse sign .",

    "after following successively from frame to frame four individual spicules he examined whether spicule motions can be interpreted as representing ballistic or constant velocity . by fitting the height variation with a quadratic function of time ( a constant acceleration model ) he found large initial velocities of 80  100  and large acceleration of 0.45  0.65kms@xmath40 .",
    "no disk features that can provide such initial velocities have been observed .",
    "he pointed out , however , the possibility that such a source could be small enough that it is not observed with the current resolution and concluded that the ballistic model of spicule motions can not be rejected from the observational point of view .",
    "he also pointed out the possibility that a rising and a falling motion can be separately fitted with a constant velocity model . in this case , the constant velocities ranged from 30 to 50 .",

    "they suggested that this behavior is strongly indicative of alfvn waves , where the term alfvn waves is used to describe incompressible transverse mhd waves that propagate along the magnetic field in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "they pointed out , however , that the observed waves could also be interpreted as mhd kink - mode waves , should a stable waveguide exist in the chromosphere . the fine structure and lateral motion of spicules has also been observed and reported by @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested that spicules can be driven by magnetic reconnection in unresolved spatial scale taking place at their foot - points .",
    "they also suggested that since most spicules emanate from a seemingly uni - polar magnetic region the relevant magnetic reconnection must take place in unresolved spatial scale contrary to the larger - scale jets associated with an emergence of a small bipole .",
    "another unexplained feature that has been reported is that sometimes a `` tilt '' of the spectral line is observed in spectrograms , i.e. , an inclination at a small angle of the line profile of some spicules to the direction of the spectrograph s dispersion @xcite .",
    "such inclinations have been observed in the @xmath0  and ca h and k spectra of spicules and could be attributed to an actual difference in the los velocities between the two sides of the spicule .",
    "one obvious explanation would be that in these cases there is actually not one but two separate unresolved spicules with different doppler velocities which are seen as one because of the low spatial resolution .",
    "another explanation which was given is that this inclination may be interpreted as resulting from the rotation of the spicule about its axis which would produce differential mass motions .",
    "if , for example , the slit of the spectrograph is oriented across the width of a rotating spicule , with the side rotating towards the observer ( towards the top of the slit ) and the side rotating away ( towards the bottom of the slit ) , then the spectral line will be inclined from the shorter wavelengths to longer wavelengths going from top to bottom along the spectral line .",
    "@xcite gave an upper velocity limit for this spicule rotation at about 30 . by considering a simplified model of a spicule as a column of gas 1000  in diameter rotating with this peripheral speed they pointed out that it would have a velocity gradient of 60  per km across it which would produce a spectral tilt of about 1.9 in k and 2.6 in @xmath0 .",
    "as they noticed this peripheral rotation velocity implies a centripetal acceleration of @xmath3 1.8 , i.e. about 6 times greater than the value of solar gravity .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , calculated a rotational velocity of @xmath3 8  and concluded that the rotation of spicules is almost negligible .",
    "recently , @xcite using high - quality observations from sst provided evidence that most , if not all , type ii spicules are characterized by the simultaneous action of three different types of motion : ( 1 ) field - aligned flows of order 50  100 , ( 2 ) swaying motions of order 15  20 , and torsional motions of order 25  30 .",
    "these last motions confirm the existence of twisting spicular motions .",
    "hinode high resolution observations revealed that most spicules show up a double thread structure during their evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "they also revealed that the separation of some of the double thread spicules changes with time , alternating between a single - thread phase and double - thread one ( fig .",
    "[ sue.fig2 ] ) .",
    "this change in separation can be interpreted by a spinning of spicules as a whole body ( spin period of 1  1.5 min and velocity @xmath315 ) .",
    "@xcite again from caii  h sot / hinode observations reported that they found many spicules to expand laterally or split into two or more strands after being ejected .",
    "a possible explanation could be that many of the splitting or expanding spicules could be small - scale magnetic eruptions , analogous to coronal mass ejections .",
    "consistent with this idea , the motion of the splitting spicules is similar to the spreading of the legs of filament eruptions .",

    "the zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels ( and of the associated spectral line ) into several components in the presence of a magnetic field . in the linear regime",
    "this splitting is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the land factor of the energy level .",
    "the longitudinal zeeman effect produces measurable stokes_v _ signals in the presence of weak magnetic fields , while to observe the signature of the transverse zeeman effect on the stokes _ q _ and _ u _ profiles , field strengths of more than 100 g are needed .",
    "the zeeman effect may produce polarized radiation that can be analyzed to infer the properties of the field .",

    "the zeeman effect is of no importance as a diagnostic tool of magnetic fields .",
    "there is , however , another physical mechanism , the so called hanle effect , which allows us to `` see '' the `` sun s hidden magnetism '' that the zeeman effect is impossible to diagnose . the hanle effect , contrary to the zeeman effect , works in any topological complex weak - field scenario ( even if the net magnetic flux turns out to be exactly zero ) .",
    "atomic level polarization signals are produced by population imbalances and quantum coherence among the magnetic sublevels of the atom due to radiative transitions induced by the anisotropic incident radiation .",

    "we should note , however , that for magnetic field strengths greater that @xmath22 10 g ( i.e. the saturated hanle effect regime ) , the hanle effect is sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic field vector , but not to its intensity . in this context",

    "the plane of polarization of this signal is given by the geometry of the scattering process and would be the same for all three lines observed .",

    "they also pointed out that the determination of the longitudinal component of the magnetic field depends on the distribution of the orientation of the magnetic fields which may produce a cancellation of the zeeman - induced stokes @xmath39 signal when magnetic field vectors are not aligned , or a significant non - negligible stokes @xmath39 signature ( and thus a significant @xmath46 component ) when the magnetic field lines team up .",

    "properties of waves and oscillations ( e.g. amplitudes , periods ) , as well as physical parameters of the medium ( e.g. temperature , density ) determined from observations can be connected through mhd wave theory to the unknown magnetic field strength and transport coefficients .    magnetic fields in spicules can also be inferred from observations of waves .",
    "several observations have shown oscillatory transverse displacement of spicule axes .",
    "this displacement can be caused by two types of waves : kink or alfvn waves . in @xcite",

    "most authors have interpreted this kind of oscillation in spicules as the observational signature of propagating kink waves .",
    "it is well known that transverse kink waves in flux tubes anchored in the photosphere can be generated by buffeting of granular motions @xcite .",
    "the propagation of kink waves can be traced either by direct observation of the tube displacement along the limb or spectroscopically by the doppler shift of spectral lines when the velocity of the kink wave is polarized in the plane of observation .",

    "@xcite analyzed @xmath0  spectra of limb spicules obtained at different heights .",

    "whether or not these structures are similar and are driven by the same mechanism , as well as their relationship to the limb spicules , has been the subject of long - standing discussions for several years .",
    "the line which has been widely used for chromospheric observations , especially following the development of the lyot filter , is the balmer @xmath0  line .",

    "@xcite has remarked that dark structures in caii  h and k filtergrams are barely visible .",

    "as in @xmath0 , the structures observed in caii  ir lines differ noticeably between active regions and the quiet sun .",
    "the traditional term mottles refers to rapidly changing hair - like jets observed in quiet sun regions on the solar disc , usually in the @xmath0  or the caii  lines .",
    "they have long been recognized to be one of the basic elements that constitute the inhomogeneous chromosphere .",
    "several authors tend to refer to these features as spicules , although spicules do not always necessarily represent only quiet sun structures seen at the limb .",
    "mottles are organized in a complex geometric pattern over the solar disk outlining the boundaries of the chromospheric network which is more prominent in the ca lines .",

    "it has been reported that at the same locations dark as well as bright mottles are observed .",
    "however , even such basic considerations as whether dark and bright mottles are the same feature seen at different heights or not , remains unanswered .",
    "some authors suggested that a bright mottle is the base of a dark elongated one @xcite , whereas others claimed that bright and dark mottles are distinctly different phenomena @xcite . today with the achievement of higher resolution observations one has the impression that what was called bright mottles is simply the bright background below the dark mottles .",
    "it is very important to note that the resolution of observations affect drastically the observed morphology of the chromospheric fine structures .",
    "since mottles are usually grouped in rosettes or chains one will fail to discriminate between different structures when using low resolution observations , since each thread and its separation are a few tenths of arcsec wide .",

    ", one must be aware that the derived values give only a parametric description of the actual velocity field , they can give , however , a qualitative picture of upward and downward moving material @xcite .",
    "although mottles show different appearance and are sometimes displaced laterally among filtergrams of different wavelengths in the @xmath0  line @xcite , we should note that no one has analyzed their horizontal motions .",
    "@xcite reported that dark mottles , after disappearing in the @xmath0 - 0.5  image , often became visible in the @xmath0 + 0.5 , consistent with up - flows followed by down - flows .",
    "@xcite has shown that some mottles are visible in the blue wing , while others appear only in the red wing .",

    "these authors after careful co - alignment and examination of a time series of high resolution images at @xmath0 - 0.65 , @xmath0  line center , and @xmath0 + 0.65  and doppler signals proposed the following description for the evolution of disk mottles : at first they appear as faint dark features at the @xmath0  blue - wing filtergrams , elongate and increase in contrast , and then fade out as a whole in this wing .",
    "a few minutes later , they appear again as dark features at the @xmath0line center , and show increased contrast and length . finally , they appear at the @xmath0  red - wing as faint , but long dark features , and shrink towards the footpoint , increasing their contrast and then fading out . they concluded that doppler signals confirm this pattern , i.e. upward radial velocity during the extending phase of the structure and downward during the receding phase or of an up  and  down moving jet as a whole .",
    "they also found that in some cases , the red - wing mottles appear near the foot - points of the blue - wing mottles in their extending phase .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , compared profile minimum intensities and doppler shifts of the minimum intensities of @xmath0  profile observed with ibis .",
    "although there are large scale spatial similarities between the @xmath0  profile - minimum map and the corresponding doppler shift map , they found two dissimilarities : a ) there is a lack of pixel - by - pixel similarity between the two maps and b ) mottles in doppler - shift maps tend to be shorter and are dark or bright ( moving upward or downward ) without obvious relation to the contrast in the profile - minimum image , except for the brightest and darkest features whose co - spatiality indicates exceptional motions in their lower ends . in the corresponding caii  infrared line observations of intensities and doppler shifts , they found slightly higher coherence but with negative correlation , i.e. higher intensity values at locations with larger blue - shifts ( dark in the maps ) .",
    "@xcite examined also the proper motion of the apparent top of mottles .",
    "they showed that the tops of some mottles approximately follow a parabolic trajectory , when they are traced through the three wavelengths along the @xmath0  line profile .",
    "fitting the trajectory with a quadratic function , they derived an initial velocity and a deceleration of proper motion . furthermore , they gave a method to derive a tilt angle from the vertical , assuming that mottles move on inclined straight flux tubes and are decelerated only by solar gravity .",
    "they found initial velocities ranging from 10 to 50  with a mean of 28  and decelerations ranging from @xmath100.2 to @xmath100.02kms@xmath40 with a mean of @xmath100.07kms@xmath40 , which are much smaller than the solar gravitational acceleration of 0.274kms@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "if mottles follow a ballistic trajectory ( material motion under a constant gravitational field ) , we can expect to find some relationship between their lengths and lifetimes .",
    "for example , if the mottle moves along a rigid magnetic flux tube of a given inclination angle , with an initial velocity along the flux tube of @xmath84 , decelerated by solar gravity @xmath85 , we have a relation between the maximum length @xmath86 projected on a horizontal plane and a half - lifetime @xmath53 of    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the lifetime of a vertical mottle whose apparent length is zero .",
    "this equation implies that longer lived mottles have larger apparent lengths , if every mottle has a similar initial velocity .",
    "@xcite studied this relation and found that longer lived mottles are physically longer and that the relation is consistent with the ballistic hypothesis .",
    "they noted , however , that although some mottles are represented by ballistic motions , a pure ballistic trajectory is unrealistic , because the observed values of initial velocity and lifetime are too small to fit the data , while the small decelerations would require the mottles to be tilted typically 60   70  from the los .",
    "@xcite , from light curves of mottles , studied their proper motions performing a least ",
    "square fit of the ballistic motion to the height measurements as a function of time .",
    "their best fit was for an inclination angle from the local vertical of @xmath3 53  and an initial velocity of @xmath3 56 .",
    "@xcite used high spatial and temporal resolution observations of a quiet sun region obtained with sst on la palma .",
    "they reported that it was very difficult to track individual dark mottles during their lifetime for several reasons among which : a ) many mottles lack a sharp top end , b ) they display significant fading which appears to be induced by opacity changes with time and c ) many mottles undergo not only up and down motions , but also significant motion transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "these factors contribute to los superposition and render the identification and follow - up of mottles throughout their lifetime quite problematic .",
    "they were able , however , to follow some mottles and found that their tops undergo a parabolic path .",
    "in addition , they found that the deceleration and maximum velocity are linearly correlated and they suggested that leakage of global oscillations from the photosphere ( with dominant periods around 5min ) plays an important role in the formation and dynamics of at least a subset of quiet sun mottles .",
    "this finding further suggests that the driving mechanism for at least some of the mottles is similar to the driving mechanism of dfs .",
    "another technique to infer velocities of structures seen in absorption on the solar disk has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the contrast profile and is called the `` cloud '' model ( see section [ cloud_model ] ) .",
    "it has been used extensively in the analysis of observations of identifiable fine structures in absorption on the solar disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite , as well as @xcite , applied this model to chromospheric mottles observed at disk centre and derived values for the 4 parameters from the observed contrast profiles .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that this model failed to explain contrast profiles near the limb , also @xcite could not reproduce some contrast profiles of sunspot fibrils . @xcite",
    "have described the range of circumstances under which this model is applicable and were able to map the 2d spatial variation of the obtained parameters . in subsequent work",
    ", @xcite using the `` cloud model '' showed that the predominant pattern of bulk motion in dark mottles is that of down - flows at their foot - points and alternating up - flows and down - flows at their tops .",
    "this result was re - confirmed by @xcite who used another set of @xmath0  observations obtained by a different instrument . in these",
    "works the bi - directional , as well as the recurrent character of the velocities was revealed . this bi - directional flow followed by down - flowing material along the whole structure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ slicec ] .",
    "as can be revealed from this figure , the upper parts of the mottles show flows in both directions , while the bottom parts show flows in the downward direction only and the whole process is repeated with a period of @xmath3 5minutes . in order to explain this kind of flow pattern they suggested that magnetic reconnection might be the mechanism responsible for the formation and dynamics of these structures .",
    "this suggestion is reasonable , since this process seems to be the most suitable physical mechanism that can explain the observed flow of material towards and away from the solar surface .",
    "furthermore , this process can occur at the network boundaries where neighboring pairs of flux tubes of opposite polarity are driven together by external plasma flows and reconnect .",
    "based on these observational findings , they proposed a simple reconnection model .",
    "such a model was also proposed by @xcite . a schematic representation of this model is given in fig .  [ recon ] ( of course , unipolar as well as bipolar fields of appropriate polarity could be involved , see figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "according to this model , the squeezing of opposite polarity field lines at the chromospheric level leads to cooling by radiation of the compressed gas , which is trapped between them and consequently to a downflow due to gravity ( left part of fig .",
    "[ recon ] ) .",
    "when opposite field lines come close , reconnection occurs , then part of the material is carried upward by the reconnected field lines , while the material below the reconnection region moves downwards under the action of both gravity and magnetic forces ( middle and right part of fig .",
    "[ recon ] ) .",
    "this cycle is repeated until the field is annihilated . analyzing the same set of data",
    ", @xcite showed that sometimes there is a temperature excess at the location where reconnection seems to be occurring , indicating the presence of local heating ( fig .",
    "[ slicec ] , right ) .",
    "their study of the intensity and doppler velocity time sequence indicated also that individual mottles appear in bursts , lasting typically for about 5min and usually reappear several times at the same location .",
    "@xcite developed a 2d rebound shock model in which a velocity pulse is steepened into shocks which produce mottles / spicules and reported quasi - periodic behaviour of the rising material due to consecutive shocks , as well as bi - directional flows due to the superposition of falling off and rising plasma portions .",
    "@xcite analyzed data acquired along the caii8542  line with the ibis instrument at the dst .",
    "they applied the cloud model to four mottles and obtained values for the four parameters given by this model .",
    "they found an almost symmetric velocity distribution between @xmath1010 and @xmath8910 , which , they suggested , is an indication of the presence of both upward and downward velocities inside the mottles . as they reported , however , the los velocities they found did not show a regular behavior .",
    "in one of the mottles examined , they obtained alternating upward and downward motion occurring in phase in all the examined segments . in another mottle , they obtained up - flows in one endpoint and down - flows in the other which reverse with a @xmath3 4min period .",

    "@xcite used observations obtained by sst investigated a group of network bright points .",
    "they reported full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700s originating above a bright point .",

    "the linkage between nb oscillations and mottles has been extensively addressed by @xcite in a study concerning periodicities of fine structures in a quiet sun network region where a chain of mottles was observed .",
    "concerning quiet sun mottles , although differences do exist in the periodicities of intensity and velocity variations , which are often bursty and intermittent , with velocity variations resulting in a large range of periods from 100 to 500s , individual mottles or regions of mottles do exhibit a most prominent period in the 5min range ( see fig.[period - mottles ] ) .",
    "they also show a 3min signature which , however , is never the dominant one .",
    "furthermore , an intermittent signature of 100s ( 10mhz ) , reported also by @xcite , seems to exist ; it is , however , unclear whether this short period could be associated with the dynamics of recently reported type ii spicules .",
    "more recently , @xcite in a multi - wavelength analysis of a solar network region showed that both mottles and nb show a periodicity of @xmath3 5min in all considered lines .",

    "the dominant 5-min periodicity present in both nb and dark mottles is compatible with the idea of the leakage of photospheric 5-min acoustic oscillations , which are the well - known p - modes , to higher layers .",
    "commonly , it was accepted that only waves with periods above the acoustic cut ",
    "off period ( which at the chromospheric level is of the order of 3min ) could travel freely in the solar atmosphere , whereas waves with higher periods were considered as evanescent . however , several theoretical studies @xcite have shown that the acoustic cut - off period is increased when waves are propagating along inclined flux tubes allowing the leakage of p - modes to higher layers .",
    "for the first time p - mode leakage has been suggested by @xcite to be related to the formation of active region fibrils .",
    "p - mode leakage , however , seems to be present also in quiet sun mottles which are also inclined flux tubes @xcite .",
    "it should also be stressed that measured periods of the order of 5min in in regions close to nb could well be attributed to the presence of inclined mottles that cover these regions .",
    "recent results reported by @xcite show that a sizable fraction of the photospheric acoustic power at periods above the acoustic cut  off might propagate to higher layers within and around the magnetic nbps .",
    "they referred to these regions as `` magneto - acoustic portals '' and showed that through these regions a significant portion of energy is provided for heating the solar chromosphere .",
    "@xcite has also suggested that propagation of longer - period waves ( i.e. equal or greater than 5min ) is even possible in vertical magnetic flux tubes , resulting from radiative losses in nbps that may lead to the lowering of the acoustic cut - off frequency .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a 2d rebound shock model which predicts quasi - periodic raising of chromospheric jet - like structures with a period of @xmath3 5min . in their simulations this periodicity results from a non - linear wake that is formed behind a leading pulse rather than from p - mode leakage .",

    "he also found that the lifetime of a fibril is a monotonically increasing function of its maximum apparent length . based on this relationship , together with the variation of fibril lengths with time he suggested that fibrils result from material being impulsively injected into magnetic field lines at @xmath22 30 , and returning back under gravity .",
    "@xcite presented high - resolution observations of an active region in the caii  k line obtained from the sst on la palma .",
    "they found that very thin , bright fibrils are a prevailing feature over large portions of the observed field .",

    "one of them is that observations in this line are , usually , obtained with broad - band filters .",
    "however , only the caii  k line core is purely chromospheric , while the wings are formed in the photosphere . with filters having a large passband , the intensity is summed over a significant portion of the line profile and thus the intensity of the line core originating from the chromosphere is rather small relative to the intensity of the line wings originating from the photosphere .",
    "if , however , observations are performed in a sufficiently narrow wavelength band to avoid contamination by photospheric radiation then fibrils can be observed .",
    "another reason is that these structures are very thin and thus very high - resolution observations are required .",
    "the fibrils are structured by the underlying magnetic field and the bright endpoints are clearly co - spatial with the magnetic concentrations in the photosphere .",
    "this is not as obvious in the strong plage where the density of the fibrils is high enough to make identifying the endpoints difficult .",
    "they reported that in a strong plage , where there is more magnetic flux and due to unipolar crowding the field is more vertical , and so are the fibrils , which are also short , and form a thick carpet covering the underlying photosphere . at the plage edges , on the other hand ,",
    "the fibrils become longer and more organized , they extend radially away from the magnetic concentrations , are nearly parallel to one another , more inclined and extend over multiple granules towards the quiet sun .",
    "while mottles have been the major constituent of the quiet solar chromosphere , recent high resolution observations revealed that in active regions there exist mottle  like structures called dynamic fibrils ( df ) which appear to form a subset of what have traditionally been called active region fibrils .",

    ", they suggested that caii  brightenings could represent acoustic shocks or fast - moving interacting magnetic elements .",
    "as they stated it is hard to understand how the energy from acoustic shocks could be converted to spicules of such high velocities .",
    "if , on the other hand , caii  brightenings represent different magnetic elements , their merging could lead to magnetic cancellation and reconnection , resulting to the deposition of thermal energy in the low atmosphere .",

    "thus , instead of the bright points that constitute the network and the facular granules that constitute the plages , which more or less represent the cross - sections of rather vertical flux tubes , thin , elongated , and usually inclined structures dominate in the chromosphere and provide evidence of its complex structure .",
    "@xcite proposed that the magnetic field of the upper solar atmosphere has a wine glass geometry as a result of magnetic field lines fanning out of the network .",
    "such a general configuration of the chromospheric magnetic field was already assumed before ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath2 = 1 layer , i.e. the layer where the gas and magnetic pressures are equal ( or , equivalently , the sound speed equals the alfvn speed ) is called _ magnetic canopy_. this layer is of critical importance because it partitions the atmosphere into contiguous volumes of gas pressure ( high-@xmath2 ) and magnetic pressure ( low-@xmath2 ) dominated plasma .",
    "the location of the magnetic canopy depends on the photospheric magnetic flux and on the pressure profile of the atmosphere in which the flux tubes are embedded .",

    "the caii  lines suffer less than @xmath0  from non - equilibrium ionization processes and thus can be modeled assuming statistical equilibrium .",
    "the cores of caii  h & k , however , form in partial redistribution , which is computationally far less trivial than complete redistribution and still has not been fully implemented in 3d . to make the problem of simulating these lines even worse we mention that the caii  h & k lines are usually observed with wide filters which deliver intensity contributions from a wide range of formation heights .",
    "partial redistribution effects are less important for the caii  infrared triplet and , moreover , these lines can be computed in 3d .",
    "current state - of - the - art instruments have delivered many high - quality chromospheric observations in the caii  8542  line , in particular , although this line has a lower line - core opacity than @xmath0  and caii  h & k. the nlte caii  8542  computation using a 3d simulation @xcite , does not show , however , the fibrilar elongated structures delineating magnetic field lines around the network .",
    "this lack may be do to several reasons , such as the low resolution of the grid used for the simulation , need for larger scale magnetic field configuration , etc .",
    "another possibility is that caii  8542  opacity in the fibrils is caused by physical processes currently included in the existing simulation codes . on the other hand , quite recently @xcite using 3d nlte radiative transfer computations and mhd simulations investigated the @xmath0  line formation in the solar chromosphere .",
    "they were able to reproduce the fibril - like dark structures seen in @xmath0  line - core observations .",
    "furthermore , their simulations support the commonly held notion that fibril - like structures indeed trace the magnetic field .",
    "knowledge of the physical conditions in isolated structures is very important in order to elucidate the physical processes which are occurring in them .",
    "a state - of - the - art method to improve this knowledge is the forward modelling by which data from a combination of radiation - mhd simulation codes with 3d nlte radiative transfer codes are converted into observed quantities and after being compared with observations can give more reliable initial values for the codes .",
    "although existing codes still suffer from severe limitations , they are producing promising results , e.g. the computation of the emerging caii  8542  and @xmath0  line profiles with a 3d nlte model using an rmhd simulation @xcite , the spectral line response to reconnection events in the photosphere and transition region @xcite , monte - carlo simulations of the line profile response to upward propagating material , such as in the case of rapid blue - shifted events , @xcite , and toy models of the solar atmosphere to qualitatively explain the appearance of the solar limb in the hinode caii  h passband caused by large line - of - sight velocities or wide spicule line profiles @xcite .",
    "one of the outstanding questions in spicule research concerns the relationship between spicules at the limb and structures observed on the disk .",
    "although spicules , mottles and fibrils are all nowadays treated as jet - like features of the solar chromosphere and the similarity of many of their properties strongly suggests that some of these phenomena are related , if not the same , there has been a strong debate in the solar community about the exact relationship between them .",
    "in particular , it has long been suspected and even assumed that the _ dark mottles _ are the direct manifestations of _ spicules _ , and considerable effort has been expended to prove this relationship .",
    "the mass velocity is one of the properties that could help establishing a kinship between mottles and spicules . @xcite",
    "have examined two distributions of axial velocities , one based on limb the other on disk observations .",
    "they arrived to the conclusion that the two distributions disagree , that the velocity in spicules is significantly greater than in mottles and thus that mottles are not the disk counterparts of spicules .",
    "they discussed several possibilities for this discrepancy , but the most important we think  not discussed in that paper  is that the velocities from which these distributions were derived have been obtained by different methods : for the limb velocities distribution the doppler shift method was used , while for the disk velocities distribution they used the `` cloud '' model .",
    "these two techniques yield very different results , as it is stated by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies on the velocities between structures seen on the disk and at the limb , apart from the problem in associating with spicules some easily identified class of disk structures , must , furthermore , be sought as due to several other reasons .",
    "these include various selection effects arising from different visibilities of the features , different wavelengths used for their observations , different phases in their evolution and also eventual bias in the data arising from the methods of analysis .",
    "they are also arising from the fact that the structures are observed under very different conditions : in one case ( limb ) at great heights and along the horizontal los ; in the other case ( disk ) at low heights and along the vertical . direct observational evidence for the identification of fine dark mottles with spicules would be that of a dark mottle crossing the solar limb .",
    "@xcite found several examples of individual mottles crossing the solar limb and provide further support to the association between spicules and mottles . on the other hand",
    ", some authors suggested that similarities in dimensions , lifetime , and physical conditions , such as density and temperature , provide indirect evidence to the identity of spicules and dark mottles @xcite .",
    "it is also not clear which the relationship is between quiet sun _ dark mottles _ and active region _ long fibrils _ and _ short dynamic fibrils _ ( dfs ) .",
    "long fibrils are found at the edges of plages , are longer , more stable , longer lived and more horizontally oriented than the most dynamic dfs , which are found towards the center of the plages , are more vertically oriented and have shorter lifetimes ( although their lifetime depends on their inclination being longer for the more inclined ones ) .",
    "the more complex topology of the quiet sun with its mixed polarity magnetic fields are to be opposed to plage regions which are considered as unipolar with magnetic flux tubes packed close together . due to these differences",
    "the conditions between quiet sun and plage regions should differ considerably and this must be reflected in the dynamics , as well as the mechanisms responsible for the formation of mottles and fibrils .",
    "thus for mottles magnetic reconnection has been suggested as the more likely formation mechanism @xcite , while for fibrils magnetoacoustic shock waves driven by leakage of convective motions and oscillations from the photosphere into the chromosphere along magnetic fields have been suggested as the formation mechanism .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite derived los velocities along mottles using the cloud model .",
    "examining the temporal evolution of the los velocity they found that the predominant motion is downward at their foot - points and alternatively upward and downward at their tops .",
    "mottles are found at the network boundaries where bipolar elements are swept by the supergranular flow .",
    "interactions of the magnetic fields have as a result the enhancement of the flux concentration in the case of same polarities or its cancellation in the case of opposite polarities .",
    "the bipolar nature of the flux cancellation process most likely involves magnetic reconnection and thus it is reasonable to consider this process as the driver of mottles .",
    "@xcite studying the formation of chromospheric jet - like structures in the framework of the rebound shock model which was based on a localized velocity pulse launched from the lower atmosphere which quickly steepens into shocks .",
    "they were able to explain the observed speed , width , heights and periods of type i spicules , as well as the observed multi - structural and bidirectional flows .",
    "fibrils , on the other hand , are found at active region plages which are considered as unipolar , with high filling factor of the magnetic field , while the field lines are only moderately inclined and the spatial distribution of magnetic flux in their core evolves slowly .",
    "it is possible that different mechanisms have to be considered as their driver . for dynamic fibrils examination of their proper motions",
    "have shown that their tops follow parabolic paths .",
    "recent observations , as well as several new , usually 2d , simulations have suggested that dynamic fibrils are driven by magnetoacoustic shock waves , which originate in the convection zone and photosphere .",
    "it has long been recognized that along inclined magnetic flux tubes p - modes leak sufficient energy from the gloabal resonant cavity into the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed 2d simulations that included the effects of radiation and heat conduction and that involved reconnection events induced by waves propagating upward from the photosphere / convection zone and were able to produce a number of jet phenomena among them spicules .",
    "@xcite performed 3d simulations and showed that some structures having the properties of mottles and dfs can be formed by upwardly propagating chromospheric waves through several driving mechanisms : collapsing granules , magnetic energy release in the photosphere or low chromosphere , p - modes , etc .",
    "they suggested that magnetic energy release events might be related to magnetic field line reconnection and thus both mechanisms , i.e. magnetic reconnection and shock waves could co - exist in the jets .",
    "their simulations , however , do not reproduce the observed values for the duration and maximum height of the jets .",
    "thus , they found durations of 2  3min ( instead of 5  10min ) and maximum heights less than 2 mm ( instead of @xmath3 10 mm ) . there is a bias also towards rather vertical structures which can not account for the heavily inclined structures that , as it is known , are responsible for the formation of the magnetic canopy .",
    "their simulations , on the other hand , showed that half of the events they found were driven by magnetic energy release , most likely related to the emergence of new field into a pre - existing ambient field .",
    "such conditions , however , do not prevail in plage regions and thus these simulations are still far from what works in the real sun . from the above",
    "it seems more plausible to consider that both drivers , i.e. waves and magnetic reconnection should be considered as responsible for the formation of both mottles and fibrils .",
    "it is also unclear what the relationship is between the recently named _ type i _ and _ type ii spicules _ and the _ traditional spicules_. traditional spicules show mean velocities of order 20  30 , lifetimes of order 5  10min , and heights of 5000  10000 .",
    "type i spicules appear to rise up from the limb and fall back again and show similar dynamical evolution as active region dfs @xcite , as well as a subset of quiet ",
    "sun mottles @xcite . for these structures magnetoacoustic shocks",
    "have also been suggested as their driven mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "the so - called type ii spicules , on the other hand , appear to exhibit upward motion followed by rapid fading without a downward moving phase .",
    "they have shorter lifetimes ( 10  100s ) , high apparent velocities ( 50  150 ) , and lower widths ( 150 and 700 ) .",
    "they undergo a swaying motion which has been suggested to be caused by the upward propagation of alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "thus it seems that type i and type ii spicules , as seen by sot on hinode , look totally different from what are considered as traditional spicules described in the literature .",
    "it has to be noticed , however , that the properties of the newly discovered type i and type ii spicules have been derived from observations in the caii  h intensity images obtained with the broad - band filter onboard the hinode spacecraft , while most of the earlier works were based on filtergrams and/or spectra obtained in the @xmath0  line .",
    "furthermore , since spicules are so dynamic and many undergo transverse motions during their lifetime , in order to infer a reliable measure of their properties if a fixed cut almost perpendicular to the limb is used then one has to rely only on spicules that did not move transversely so that their full lifetime can be covered . in a recent work @xcite",
    "re - analyzing the same data sets used by @xcite traced the intensity along individual structures in quiet sun and ch .",
    "they claimed that they could not find a single convincing example of type ii spicules .",
    "furthermore , they claimed that more than 60% of the identified spicules in each region showed a complete cycle , i.e. , the majority are type i spicules . due to these discrepancies",
    ", it can not be clear how the traditional spicules are related to the type i and type ii sot / hinode spicules .",
    "furthermore , what is measured in caii  h images is apparent motions and it is unclear whether they are associated with bulk mass motions derived sometimes in the @xmath0line .",
    "the differences in the heights , lifetimes , velocities and driving mechanisms that pointed that there are two types of spicules should also be questioned .",
    "are there really two different distributions of the different parameters or one broad distribution with a wide range of values ?",
    "@xcite gave histograms of upward and downward velocities in traditional spicules in the range @xmath2060  70 , lifetimes in the range 2  10min , heights in the range 6  16 mm .",
    "@xcite give also a distribution of the apparent velocities in the so - called traditional spicules from which it can be seen that they are in the range 0  70  ( see fig.[axial_velo ] , left ) .",
    "regarding the formation mechanisms , @xcite found that : if the explosion ( reconnection ) occurs below the middle chromosphere , the jets are formed as a result of shocks ; if the explosion ( reconnection ) occurs above the middle chromosphere the jets are directly driven by reconnection .",
    "@xcite using the shock model explained why spicules are taller in coronal holes and shorter in active regions .",
    "thus in our opinion the question whether there really exist two types of spicules or one type of spicules with very broad distributions of heights , lifetimes and velocities , remains open .",
    "recently an important effort has been undertaken to establish a relationship between _ type i _ or _ type ii spicules _ and _ structures on the disk _",
    ", such as straws and rbes .",
    "it is suggested that straws seen in dot caii  h near - limb images appearing bright against the very dark background and fast - waving might be identical to the fast - waving type ii spicules .",
    "@xcite , suggested that caii  8542  rbes might be the on - disk counterparts of type ii spicules observed at the limb by the hinode caii  h broad filter .",
    "this suggestion was based on the similarity in evolution , lifetime , spatial extent and location .",
    "rbes , however , show low blue - shifts of 15  20 , as opposed to the high apparent velocities reported for type ii spicules . in order to explain this discrepancy they used monte carlo simulations and showed that the low observed blue - shifts can be explained by a wide range of spicule orientations combined with a lack of opacity @xcite .",
    "of course , type ii spicules have very short lifetimes , small spatial dimensions and change very fast and thus they are on the limit of what can be resolved with present - day telescopes .",
    "@xcite from spectral observations in the @xmath0and caii  h 8542  lines reported also that the disk counterparts of type ii spicules might be the rbes based on the similarities on their appearance , lifetimes , longitudinal and transverse velocities and occurrence rate .",
    "recently , @xcite used on - disk @xmath0  observations of rbes obtained with sot / hinode and reported that they found direct evidence of a strong correlation between the rbes and short - lived brightenings in a wide range of transition region ( tr ) and coronal passbands observed with the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on - board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) space mission .",
    "they , also , found evidence that chromospheric spicules observed in caiih with sot / hinode at the limb in coronal holes are intimately linked to the formation of features at ( tr ) and coronal temperatures and concluded that on - disk rbes and caii  h limb spicules are connected .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in a recent work , @xcite questioned whether spicules ( and fibrils ) are straw - like fine structures ( as assumed by most authors ) or whether they are best described as warps in a sheet .",
    "readron ( 2012 , private comm . ) suggests that some features may appear within @xmath222 sec , clearly questioning the plasma ejection flux - tube model as this implies mach speeds well in excess of 100 .",
    "higher cadence data from present - day imaging spectrometers will allow us to access whether ( or what fraction ) of these features are jet / tube features or as suggested by @xcite as current sheets .",
    "spicules produced by these current sheets could also be a natural explanation for the caii  h type ii spicules which are very fast and seem to disappear rather than falling back to the lower atmosphere .    furthermore , it is not known if spicule - like structures seen in uv and euv are some aspects of traditional spicules or totally independent features .",
    "several authors suggest that uv spicules may be the result of heating of chromospheric spicules to uv temperatures .",
    "this would provide an explanation for the reports that spicules often `` fade from view '' when being observed in chromospheric spectral lines ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that uv spicules are a transition region `` sheath '' that surrounds the chromospheric spicules .",
    "in this review we present observations and physical parameters of fine - scale structures observed in the solar chromosphere .",
    "the solar chromosphere is dominated by a variety of thin , jet - like features omnipresent in quiet , as well as in active regions , and on the disk , as well as at the limb . because of their small size and the limitations of ground - based observations , for many decades it was difficult to characterize completely their properties , and much less to determine with confidence their interrelationship and the mechanism(s ) responsible for their generation . in recent years because of the improved quality of observations acquired by ground and space - based instrumentation and , especially , with the current ability to observe the chromosphere with high resolution and high time cadence exciting jet - like features",
    "have been detected that were not recognized earlier .",
    "their properties are not yet fully unraveled , while new names have been attributed to distinguish them from those previously observed .",
    "the nomenclature is nowadays rather confusing , but there are strong indications that , at least some if not all of the several observed fine - scale structures , are physically closely related , if not the same .",
    "it seems also that all these small - scale structures are related to the fine - scale structure of the magnetic field and its evolution .",
    "magnetic field lines are the most likely channels for transporting convective energy to the solar upper atmospheric layers",
    ". detailed spatial and temporal high - resolution observations of the magnetic fields are crucial for understanding the small - scale structures and investigating their role in powering the sun s outer atmosphere .",
    "magnetic field extrapolations are also very important tools in reconstructing the 3-d topology of the upper solar layers .",
    "different methods have been proposed so far based on different assumptions .",
    "of particular interest is the reconstruction of the 3-d magnetic topology in inclined fine - scale structures , such as e.g. spicules . these structures , being magnetic flux tubes following the local inclination of the magnetic field lines , define the layer of the magnetic canopy , i.e. the layer where the plasma @xmath2 ( ratio of the gas to the magnetic pressure ) is equal to 1 .",
    "this layer is very important , since acoustic waves generated by the convective motions upon meeting this layer undergo mode conversion , refraction , reflection and transmission with important effects to the upper solar atmosphere .",
    "the state - of - the - art in the understanding of small - scale events and their interrelationship requires simultaneous , co - spatial , multi - wavelength , high spatial and temporal resolution ground - based observations combined with observations from forefront observing space facilities of the same solar region . such observations will permit their follow - up from the photospheric to the lower coronal level of the solar atmosphere .",
    "they will also permit a better correlation between manifestations of the same phenomenon in different atmospheric heights and , hence , are a powerful tool for understanding the physics that governs the generation and dynamics of fine - scale structures .",
    "apart from different types of studies based on analyses of observations , there is an on - going development and refinement of non - lte and cloud model inversion codes of spectral line profiles based on better understood physics of spectral line formation and radiation transfer .",
    "these codes together with advances in theory are an indispensable tool for a more accurate determination of several physical parameters that describe the observed fine structures .",
    "quantitative determinations of such parameters is an essential ingredient not only for their modelling , but also for the modelling of the solar atmosphere as a whole . by their accurate determination it will also be possible to define the basic physics of , at least , some of the coronal heating processes and the origin and generation of the solar wind .",
    "these developments go hand in hand with improvements in numerical simulations and improvement of observational technology .",
    "numerical simulations , using 3d mhd codes together with forward modelling that produce precise synthetic data which are able to mimic accurately improved observations are important to correctly interpret them .",
    "it is hoped that , in the near future , the combination of state - of - the art multi - wavelength observations , along with improved nlte codes , realistic mhd simulations and forward modelling , will provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the fine - scale chromospheric structures .",
    "the authors would like to thank the international space science institute ( issi ) in bern , switzerland , for the hospitality provided to the members of the team on `` solar small - scale transient phenomena and their role in coronal heating '' , as well as the members of the team for fruitful discussions .",
    "we also acknowledge the remarks and suggestions made by the two referees which helped to improve the paper ."
