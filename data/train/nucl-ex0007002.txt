    "the word heavy used in the title requires a short explanation .",
    "the reason is rather historical , and it seems now that heavy are all mesons but not pions .",
    "the talk will concern the production of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons , and since @xmath6 is even heavier than @xmath5 the discussion concerning this meson will constitute the major part of the presentation .",
    "last year , for the first time total cross sections for the production of the @xmath6 meson in the collision of protons close to the reaction threshold have been published  @xcite .",
    "two independent experiments performed at the accelerators saturne and cosy have delivered consistent results .",
    "the first remarkable inference derived from these experiments was that the total cross sections for the @xmath7 reaction are by about a factor of fifty smaller than the cross sections for the @xmath3 reaction at the corresponding values of the excess energy . trying to explain this large difference hibou et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the one - pion - exchange model with the parameters adjusted to fit the total cross section for the @xmath3 reaction underestimate the @xmath6 data by about a factor of two .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that short - range production mechanisms as for example heavy meson exchange , mesonic currents  @xcite , or more exotic processes like the production via a fusion of gluons  @xcite may contribute significantly in the creation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons  @xcite . especially that the momentum transfer required to create these mesons is much larger compared to the pion production , and already in case of pions a significant contribution from the short - range heavy meson exchange is necessary in order to obtain agreement with the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the second interesting observation was that the energy dependence of the total cross section for the @xmath3 and @xmath7 reactions does not follow the predictions based on the phase space volume and the proton - proton final state interaction , which is the case in the @xmath8 meson production  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons the deviation from this prediction were qualitatively different .",
    "namely , the close to threshold cross sections for the @xmath5 meson are strongly enhanced compared to the model comprising only the proton - proton interaction  @xcite in contrary to the observed suppression in the case of the meson @xmath6 .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section for the @xmath3 reaction can be , however , explained when the @xmath5-proton attractive interaction is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "albeit @xmath5-proton interaction is much weaker than the proton - proton one ( compare scattering length a@xmath9  fm + @xmath10  0.274  fm  @xcite with a@xmath11  fm  @xcite ) it becomes important through the interference terms between the various final pair interactions  @xcite . by analogy ,",
    "the steep decrease of the total cross section when approaching a kinematical threshold for the @xmath7 reaction could have been explained assuming a repulsive @xmath6-proton interaction  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation , however , should rather be excluded now in view of the new cosy-11 data which will be presented in the next chapters .",
    "the theoretical studies of the mechanisms accounting for the @xmath8 and @xmath5 mesons creation in the close to threshold @xmath12 reactions have shown that the short - range component of the n - n force and the off - shell pion rescattering dominate the production process of the @xmath8 meson  @xcite , whereas the @xmath5 meson is predominantly produced through the excitation of the intermediate baryonic resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison of the experimentally determined @xmath5 and @xmath6 total cross section ratio with the predictions based on the one - pion - exchange model indicates that we are still far from the full understanding of the dynamics of the discussed processes . in particular , at present",
    "there is not much known about the relative contribution of the possible reaction mechanisms to the production of the meson @xmath6 .",
    "it is expected that similarly as in the case of pions the @xmath6 meson can be produced as depicted in figures  [ grafy]a , b , c , d . however , because of the much larger four - momentum transfer , short - range mechanisms , like heavy meson exchange ( figure  [ grafy]c ) or depicted in figure  [ grafy]e production via a mesonic current , where the @xmath6 is created in a fusion of exchanged virtual @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 mesons shell contribute even more significantly . recently",
    "nakayama et al .",
    "@xcite , studied contributions from the _ nucleonic _",
    "[ grafy]b ) , _ nucleon resonance _",
    "[ grafy]d ) , and _ mesonic _",
    "[ grafy]e ) currents and found that each one separately could describe the absolute values and energy dependence of the close to threshold @xmath6 data points  @xcite after an appropriate adjustment of the ratio of the pseudoscalar to the pseudovector coupling .",
    "this rather pessimistic conclusion means that it is not possible to judge about the mechanisms responsible for the @xmath6 meson production from the total cross section alone .",
    "moreover , the possible gluonium admixture in the meson @xmath6 makes the study even more complicated but certainly also more interesting .",
    "figure  [ grafy]f depicts appropriate short - range mechanism which may lead to the creation of the flavour singlet state via a fusion of gluons emitted from the exchanged quarks of the colliding protons  @xcite .",
    "albeit the quark content of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons is very similar , this manner of the production should contribute primarily in the creation of the meson @xmath6 .",
    "this is due to the small pseudoscalar mixing angle ( @xmath16 )  @xcite which implies that the @xmath6 meson is predominantly a flavour singlet state and is expected to contain a significant admixture of gluons .",
    "further , it is almost two times heavier than @xmath5 and hence its creation requires much larger momentum transfer which is more probable to be realized in the short - range interactions . unfortunately , at present there are no theoretical calculations concerning this mechanism .",
    "now , since the effective coupling constant describing the @xmath6-proton - proton vertex is not known , it is even not possible to determine the contribution from the simplest possible production mechanism where the @xmath6 is supposed to be emitted as a bremsstrahlung radiation from one of the colliding protons as it is shown in figure  [ grafy]a .",
    "therefore , investigations of the @xmath6 production have to deal with a few problems at the same time .",
    "namely : unknown reaction mechanism , unknown coupling constant , and unknown proton-@xmath6 interaction . in the next section the present status of the knowledge about the effective nn@xmath6",
    "coupling constant will be given .",
    "in the effective lagrangian approach  @xcite the strength of the nucleon-@xmath6 coupling is driven by the the @xmath17 coupling constant @xmath18 , which comprises the information about the structure of the @xmath6 meson and the nucleon .",
    "the knowledge of the coupling constant is necessary in the calculation of the production cross section if one considers the feynman diagrams as illustrated in figure  [ grafy ] .",
    "the main difficulty in the determination of this quantity is due to the fact that usually the direct production on the nucleon is either associated with the production through baryonic resonances , as in the case of the @xmath19 reaction  @xcite , or with the exchange of other mesons .",
    "therefore , if the direct production mechanism is not dominant it is not possible to extract the @xmath17 coupling without the clear understanding of the other mechanisms .",
    "however , it would be very interesting to determine the @xmath18 coupling constant and to compare it with the calculations performed on the quark level assuming the @xmath6 meson structure .",
    "first theoretical considerations concerning this issue have been published last year  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons are mixtures of the su(3 ) singlet and octet states , one can relate the @xmath20 and @xmath17 coupling constants by the following equation  @xcite : @xmath21 the measurements of the @xmath22  @xcite reaction have yielded that : @xmath23 whereas the comparison of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 reaction cross sections implies  @xcite : @xmath26 .",
    "the above inequalities and equation  [ getaetap ] lead to the following range for the @xmath18 value : @xmath27 which is to be compared to the @xmath6 coupling determined from the fits to low energy nucleon - nucleon scattering in the one - boson - exchange models amounting to @xmath28  @xcite .    on the other hand , the @xmath18 coupling constant determined via dispersion methods  @xcite turns out to be smaller than  1 , @xmath29 , which is in contradiction to the above estimations .",
    "the @xmath18 coupling constant is also related to the issue of the total quark contribution to the proton spin  ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the approximate equation derived in reference  @xcite reads : @xmath31 where , @xmath32  @xcite denotes the @xmath6 decay constant and m the proton mass .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the contributions from up , down and strange quarks , respectively   quark are usually not considered , but i.  halperin and a.  zhitnitsky suggested  @xcite that the intrinsic charm component of proton may also carry a significant amount of the proton spin .",
    "the quark and gluon contributions to the proton spin are widely discussed in the literature  @xcite based on measurements of the spin asymmetries in deep - inealstic scattering of polarised muons on polarised protons . ] .",
    "the total contribution of the quarks to the proton spin amounts to @xmath36  @xcite . applying this value in the above equation one",
    "obtains @xmath37 , which is consistent with the upper limit @xmath38 set from the comparison of the measured total cross section values for the @xmath7 reaction with the calculations based on the effective lagrangian approach , where only a direct production has been considered  @xcite .",
    "the present estimations for @xmath18 inferred from different experiments are widely spread from 0.2 to 7.3 and are not consistent with each others .",
    "therefore more effort is needed on experimental as well as theoretical side to fix this important parameter .",
    "the experiments were performed at the cooler synchrotron cosy - jlich  @xcite which accelerates protons up to a momentum of @xmath39 .",
    "the threshold momenta for the @xmath3 and @xmath7 reactions are equal to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "about @xmath42 accelerated protons circulate in the ring passing @xmath43 times per second through the @xmath44 cluster target  @xcite installed in front of one of the dipole magnets , as depicted schematically in figure  [ tarczawiazka ] .",
    "[ aabc ] the target is realized as a beam of @xmath44 molecules grouped inside clusters of up to @xmath45 atoms .    at the intersection point of the cluster beam with the cosy proton beam",
    "the collision of protons may result for example in the production of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "the ejected protons of the @xmath46 reaction , having smaller momenta than the beam protons , are separated from the circulating beam by the magnetic field .",
    "further they leave the vacuum chamber through a thin exit foil and are registered by the detection system consisting of drift chambers and scintillation counters as depicted in  figure  [ tarczawiazka ] .",
    "the measurement of the track direction by means of the drift chambers , and the knowledge of both the dipol magnetic field and the target position allow to reconstruct the momentum vector for each registered particle .",
    "the time of flight measured between the s1 ( s2 ) - and the s3 scintillators gives the particle velocity . having momentum and velocity for each particle one can calculate its mass , and hence identify it .    in the first step of the data analysis events with two tracks in drift chambers",
    "were preselected , and the mass of each particle was evaluated .",
    "figure  [ invmass ] shows the squared mass of two simultaneously detected particles .",
    "a clear separations is seen into groups of events with two protons , two pions , proton and pion and also deuteron and pion .",
    "thus , this spectrum allowed for a software selection of events with two registered protons .",
    "the knowledge of the momenta of both protons before and after the reaction allows to calculate the mass of an unobserved particle or system of particles created in the reaction .",
    "figure  [ miss]a depicts the missing mass spectrum obtained for the @xmath47 reaction at the excess energy value of q  =  5.8  mev above the @xmath6 meson production threshold .",
    "most of the entries in this spectrum originate in the multi - pion production , forming a continuous background to the well distinguishable peaks accounting for the @xmath13 and @xmath6 mesons production , which can be seen at mass values of 782  mev / c@xmath48 and 958  mev / c@xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the signal of the @xmath0 reaction is better to be seen in the figure  [ miss]b , where the missing mass distribution only in the vicinity of the kinematical limit is presented .",
    "figure  [ miss]c shows the missing mass spectrum for the measurement at q  =  7.6  mev together with the multi - pion background as combined from the measurements at different excess energies  @xcite .",
    "subtraction of the background leads to the spectrum with a clear peak at the mass of the meson @xmath6 as shown by the solid line in figure  [ miss]d .",
    "the dashed histogram in this figure corresponds to the monte - carlo simulations where the beam and target conditions were deduced from the measurements of the elastically scattered protons  @xcite .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 12.2,15.0 ) ( -0.5,0.0 ) ( 5.0,3.7 ) ( 7.0,0.0 ) ( 12.5,3.7 ) ( -0.5,5.0 ) ( 5.0,8.7 ) ( 7.0,5.0 ) ( 12.5,8.7 ) ( -0.5,10.0 ) ( 1.0,13.8 ) ( 7.0,10.0 ) ( 12.5,13.8 )    the scale of the simulated distribution was adjusted to fit the data , but the consistency of the widths is a measure of understanding of the detection system and the target - beam conditions .",
    "histograms from a measurement at q  =  1.5  mev shown in figures  [ miss]e , f demonstrate the achieved accuracy at the cosy-11 detection system .",
    "the width of the missing mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ miss]f ) , which is now close to the natural width of the @xmath6 meson ( @xmath49  mev  @xcite ) , is again well reproduced by the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "determination of ( a ) number of the produced @xmath6 events from the presented above missing mass distributions , ( b ) luminosity from the simultaneous measurements of the elastically scattered protons , and ( c ) detection system acceptance by means of the monte - carlo simulations allows for the calculations of the total cross section for the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath50 reaction was determined by the same method , however , with a much bigger signal to background ratio ( 40/1 ) due to the larger total cross section values  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ etap - eta ] shows the compilation of the total cross sections for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson production together with the new cosy-11 data shown as filled squares  ( @xmath5 ) and filled circles  ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the cosy-11 data on the @xmath5 production were taken changing continously during the measurement cycle a momentum of the uncooled proton beam .",
    "this technique allowed for the precise determination of the total cross section energy dependence near the kinematical threshold .",
    "the obtained result confirmed the enhancement of the close to threshold total cross section values compared to the predictions based on the phase space factors and the proton - proton fsi which was earlier observed by the pinot  @xcite , wasa  @xcite , and spes  iii  @xcite collaborations .",
    "new cosy  -  11 data concerning @xmath6 meson production are shown in figure  [ etap - eta ] as filled circles .",
    "these measurements on the @xmath7 reaction were performed with the stochastically cooled proton beam and the integrated luminosity of 1360  nb@xmath2 .",
    "statistical and systematical errors are separated by dashes .",
    "the systematical error of the energy equals to 0.44  mev constitutes of the 0.3  mev due to the uncertainty in the detection system  @xcite and 0.14  mev due to the uncertainty in the @xmath6 meson mass  @xcite .",
    "the systematical error of the cross section values , including the overall normalization uncertainty , amounts to 15  @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to stress again , that spes  iii and cosy  -  11 results obtained at different laboratories are in a perfect agreement .",
    "the dashed - dotted line in figure  [ etap - eta ] shows the energy dependence predicted by fldt and wilkin  @xcite normalized now to the cosy-11 data points , and the solid line corresponds to the predictions based on a one - pion - exchange model adjusted to fit the close to threshold @xmath50 data ( dashed line )  @xcite .",
    "the factor two discrepancy suggests that the short - range mechanisms may play a prominent role in the production of these mesons  @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations performed by nakayama et al .  @xcite indicate that the determination of the total cross section close to threshold is surely not sufficient to establish the contributions from different mechanisms to the overall production amplitude . specifically , the primary production amplitude for processes studied by these authors ( fig .",
    "[ grafy]b , d , e ) does not change significantly within the present experimental accuracy for the excess energies below q  =  30  mev .",
    "therefore , the energy dependence of the total cross section for q  @xmath52  30  mev should be quite well described by the integral of the phase space volume weighted by the squared amplitude of the final state interaction among the outgoing particles . and indeed , as shown in figure  [ etap - fsi ] , the data are in a good agreement with this model even without considering the @xmath6-proton interaction .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the @xmath6-proton interaction is too weak to influence considerably , within the experimental error bars , the total cross section energy - dependence .",
    "the cross section for the reaction @xmath53 can be expressed as : @xmath54 where , @xmath55 denotes the transition matrix element for the @xmath56 reaction , and x stands for @xmath57 or @xmath6 mesons . in analogy with the _ watson - migdal _",
    "approximation  @xcite for two body processes , it can be assumed that the complete transition amplitude of a production process @xmath55 factorizes approximately as  @xcite : @xmath58 where , @xmath59 accounts for all possible production processes , and @xmath60 describes the elastic interaction of protons and x meson in the exit channel . making further assumptions that only the proton - proton interaction is present in the exit channel ( @xmath61 ) and that the primary production amplitude does not change with the excess energy , it is possible to calculate @xmath62 .",
    "the enhancement from the proton - proton interaction , @xmath63 , was estimated as an inverse of the squared jost function , with coulomb interaction being taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath63 is a dimensionless factor which turns to zero with vanishing relative protons momentum k , peaks sharply at k@xmath6425  mev / c and approaches asymptotically unity for large proton - proton relative momenta .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 12.2,12.0 ) ( -0.5,0.0 ) ( 6.8,0.0 ) ( 3.0,6.2 )    figure  [ m0 ] compares the extracted absolute values for the modulus of the primary production amplitude for the near - threshold production of the @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 is normalized to unity at the point of highest excess energy , for each meson separately .",
    "if the performed assumptions in the derivation of @xmath62 were fulfilled the obtained values would be equal to one as depicted by the solid line .",
    "it can be seen , however , that in the case of the @xmath5 meson , @xmath62 grows with decreasing excess energy reflecting attractive @xmath5-proton interaction . in the data for the @xmath8 production , apart from the two closest - to - threshold points is equal to 0.5  @xcite .",
    "thus , one should be careful , at small excess energies , where the approximately treated coulomb interaction dominates .",
    "] , one can notice a tiny grow of @xmath62 when the excess energy decreases from q  =  20  mev to q  =  2  mev .",
    "this may be cause by the small @xmath65-proton interaction .",
    "the deviation from the constant is much smaller than in the @xmath5 meson case since , the s - wave @xmath65-proton interaction is much weaker than the @xmath5-proton one .",
    "similarly , neglecting the two lowest points for the @xmath6 meson , one observes about 20  @xmath51 increase of @xmath62 when approaching the threshold .",
    "this may indicate a small attractive @xmath6-proton interaction . anyhow , with the new cosy  -  11 data points the possible @xmath6-proton repulsive interaction must be excluded .    instead of conclusion",
    "the article of bernard et al .",
