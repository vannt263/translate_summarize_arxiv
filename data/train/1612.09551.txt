    "most of the models proposed so far are attributed to either dissipation of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) waves or magnetic reconnection . among the several proposed ideas ,",

    "@xcite first suggested existence of electromagnetic - hydrodynamic waves in the solar atmosphere and its importance in the heating of solar corona @xcite .",
    "this led to the wave heating model of solar corona . in this model ,",
    "convective motions at the footpoints of magnetic flux tubes are assumed to generate wave - like fluctuations that propagate up into the extended corona @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are often proposed to partially reflect back down toward the sun , develop into strong magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) turbulence , and dissipate gradually @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) alfvn wave turbulence model to explain the heating of both solar chromosphere and corona in the coronal loop .",
    "another model used to explain coronal heating is nanoflare heating model ( see recent review by * ? ? ?",
    ". in this model , random photospheric motions and flows lead to twisting and braiding of coronal field lines .",
    "this results in building up of magnetic stress , and thus , leads to release of energy in the form of impulsive heating events called as nanoflares @xcite .    in order to understand wave heating mechanism of solar atmosphere , observations of detection , propagation , and dissipation of waves are essential . @xcite and @xcite reported the ubiquitous presence of outward propagating alfvnic ( transverse ) waves in the solar corona . propagating alfvnic waves",
    "were also found in the polar region @xcite .",
    "comprehensive review exists on the detection of propagating waves in the solar atmosphere , e.g. , @xcite . in recent studies , evidence of damping of propagating waves",
    "are also reported .",
    "signatures of alfvn waves can also be found through the study of broadening of spectral line profiles in the solar corona .",
    "alfvnic wave motions are transverse to the direction of propagation . in case of field lines aligned in the plane of sky , plasma motions due to alfvnic waves",
    "will either be directed towards or away from the line - of - sight . in the off - limb corona",
    ", several spatially unresolved structures may be present along the line - of - sight with different phases of oscillations .",
    "these unresolved wave motions can lead to non - thermal broadening of spectral line profiles .",
    "thus , observed non - thermal broadening of spectral line profiles in the corona will be proportional to alfvn wave amplitude , e.g. , .",
    "there are numerous studies devoted to measure off - limb non - thermal broadening of spectral lines to search for any wave activity .",

    "@xcite investigated cool loop and dark lane over a off - limb active region and obtained basic plasma parameters as a function of height above the limb .",
    "they found slight decrease in non - thermal velocity along the cool loop whereas sharp fall along the dark lane .",
    "they attributed these findings to wave damping .",
    "@xcite also measured energy and dissipation of alfvnic waves in the quiet sun region .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a 3-d mhd model of alfvn wave turbulence to explain the heating of solar chromosphere and corona in the coronal loop .",
    "this model has attracted lot of attention from the community to look for such signatures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on off - limb active region loop system and quiet sun corona to study propagation of alfvn waves with height and search for any signature of their damping over a wide range of temperature . as alfvn wave energy flux density is given by ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is mass density ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 is proton mass , and @xmath7 is electron number density ) , @xmath8 is alfvn wave velocity amplitude , and @xmath9 is alfvn wave propagation velocity given as @xmath10 .",

    "this dataset was previously analyzed by to study electron density and temperature structure of a limb active region .",
    "we followed standard procedures for preparing the eis data using idl routine eis_prep available in the _ solar software _ ( ssw ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite showed that absolute calibration of eis data leads to a systematic overestimation of spectral line widths for most of the pixels along slit .",
    "thus , for the purpose of measuring line widths , we obtained eis spectra in the data number ( dn ) unit by applying eis_prep routine with /noabs keyword .",
    "moreover , we also obtained eis spectra in the physical units ( erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 ) to further perform electron number density diagnostics .",

    "comparison between both type of spectra reconfirms the systematic overestimation of line widths from absolutely calibrated data as recently reported by @xcite and @xcite .",

    ", @xmath17 will always be a constant .",
    "because in a constant magnetic field model , cross - sectional area will remain constant , thus , product will also remain constant .",
    "however , in the case of expanding flux tube model , @xmath18 will decrease with height ( let us assume inverse square field dependence ) , whereas @xmath19 will increase with squared radius dependence , thus , product of @xmath18 and @xmath19 will again be constant . therefore , total alfvn wave energy flux will always be proportional to @xmath20 in either case . henceforth , if total alfvn wave energy flux is conserved as waves propagates outward , @xmath20 will remain constant with height . in figures  [ fig : enrg_ar1 ] , [ fig : enrg_ar2 ] , and [ fig : enrg_qs ] , we plot variations of @xmath21 with height obtained from selected spectral lines along active region ar1 , ar2 , and quiet sun qs respectively . as electron number densities were estimated only from few spectral line pairs , therefore for rest of the lines , we choose number densities obtained from line pairs formed at nearest temperature .",
    "plots clearly show that product @xmath21 decreases with height in all spectral lines in all the regions .",
    "this provides clear evidence of damping of alfvn wave energy flux with height in the both off - limb active and quiet sun region .",
    "alfvn wave energy fluxes are found to be @xmath22 erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 near the limb which decreases to @xmath23 erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 at around height of 70 mm as calculated from fe  xii 192   spectral line . to calculate the alfvn wave energy flux , we assumed coronal magnetic field strength of 39 g as measured by using loop oscillations . calculated alfvn wave energy fluxes are of similar order of magnitude which is required to maintain the active region corona .",
    "moreover , coronal magnetic field strength can vary like 10 g and 33 g as measured by @xcite in two active regions at distances of 0.12 and 0.15 @xmath24 using longitudinal zeeman effect in fe  xiii 10747   spectral line . therefore",
    ", if assumed magnetic field strength is of the order of 10 g , then alfvn wave energy fluxes will be slightly less than the energy flux required to maintain the corona .",
    "one thing to be noted here that although alfvn waves are getting gradually damped with height , non - thermal velocities obtained from warm spectral lines were initially increasing with height in the active region .",
    "this indicates that damping of alfvn waves can only be inferred from complete calculation of total alfvn wave energy flux with height . only non - thermal velocity estimates with height",
    "will not serve the purpose .    upon finding the evidence of damping of alfvn wave energy flux with height , we further obtain damping length in all the spectral lines covering range of temperature .",
    "effect of damping can be calculated by multiplying @xmath25 to the proportional alfvn wave energy flux @xmath20 , where @xmath26 is termed as damping length  for total alfvn wave energy flux ,    @xmath27    @xmath28    where a and b are appropriate constants .",
    "henceforth , we obtained damping length by fitting the @xmath29 values in different spectral lines as per equation  [ eq : damping ] using mpfit routines @xcite .",
    "derived damping lengths @xmath26 from various spectral lines along active region ar1 , ar2 , and quiet sun qs are in the range of 25 - 170 mm and provided in the table  [ tab : damp_scale ] .",
    "@xcite also reported decay of alfvn wave energy flux with height in the polar coronal hole region .",
    "however , they performed linear fit to decay profile and estimated decay rates to be @xmath30 erg  cm@xmath14 below 0.03 r@xmath32 and @xmath33 erg  cm@xmath14 between 0.03 - 0.4 r@xmath32 .",
    "equivalent damping length for the decay rate between 0.03 - 0.4 r@xmath32 is calculated to be around 95 mm .",
    "they performed measurements using eis fe  xii 195   spectral line . in this work ,",
    "damping lengths obtained from fe  xii 192   lines are in the range of 7590 mm in both active and quiet sun regions .",
    "this suggests that damping lengths obtained from both the studies are comparable .",
    "in this work , we found clear evidence of damping of alfvn waves in the off - limb active and quiet sun region .",
    "damping lengths were found to be different for different spectral lines formed at different temperatures ( see table  [ tab : damp_scale ] ) .",
    "we further explore existence of any temperature dependence on various decay lengths obtained in this study . henceforth , we analyze density scale heights and alfvn wave damping lengths with peak formation temperature of their respective spectral lines ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "we plot density scale heights obtained from the different line pairs with respect to their peak formation temperature ( see top panels of figure  [ fig : temp_damp ] ) .",
    "density scale heights first increase and later decrease with temperature .",
    "however , density scale height obtained from fe  xii pair does not follow this trend .",
    "moreover , hydrostatic scale heights as expected from equation  [ eq : stemp ] are also provided in table  [ tab : dens_scale ] . as mentioned earlier , comparison between the two density scale heights",
    "indicate that both active and quiet sun regions are basically underdense , with few exceptions from quiet sun region .",
    "however , it appears that emissions coming from spectral lines formed near the temperature of 1.8 mk are more closer to be in hydrostatic equilibrium than those formed different from 1.8 mk in the active region .",
    "this may be speculated as observed region to be filled with plasma of temperature nearly 1.8 mk and has poor supply for other cooler and hotter plasma .",
    "this result might be a characteristic of observed active region , and different active regions might have different temperature distribution .    in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : temp_damp ] , we plot damping lengths obtained from different spectral lines with respect to their peak formation temperature .",
    "different panels show that damping lengths first increase and later decrease with temperature .",
    "maximum damping length is attained at around temperature of 1.78 mk ( corresponds to fe xiii 202  ) for all the active region and quiet sun stripes .",
    "we would also like to point out that several structures were traced and analyzed as mentioned earlier .",
    "although obtained decay lengths were not same , results followed similar pattern for all the analyzed structures . henceforth , obtained results indicate measurement of different damping lengths for different temperatures .",
    "these results can either be interpreted as temperature dependent damping of alfvn waves or measurement of different damping lengths in different coronal structures formed over wide range of temperature along the our line - of - sight .",
    "possible temperature dependent damping length of alfvn waves may indicate that thermal conduction plays some important role in the damping of these waves .",
    "however , role of thermal conduction in the damping of alfvn waves is not much explored ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although it is very well studied for the case of slow magneto - acoustic waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "role of thermal conduction in the damping of slow magneto - acoustic waves were recently observed by and @xcite based on possible period ( of waves ) dependent damping length . in this study , although we do not have any information on wave period , we have coverage over wide range of temperature .",
    "work of @xcite suggested that slightly enhanced thermal conductivity may explain observed damping lengths of 40 - 50 mm for slow waves .",
    "these enhancements in thermal conductivity were later also suggested by . in this study , observed damping lengths for alfvn waves are in the range of 25 - 170 mm as obtained from different temperature lines . henceforth , these results demand for detailed investigation of role of thermal conduction in the damping of alfvn waves .",
    "slow magneto - acoustic waves in the solar corona propagate along the field lines with propagation speed of the order of 100 km s@xmath14 and velocity amplitude of the order of 5 - 10 km s@xmath14 .",
    "active region studied in this work is located near the limb and derived results are mainly focused on off - limb regions . in the off - limb region ,",
    "magnetic field lines are generally found to be oriented nearly perpendicular to the observers line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , contribution from observed doppler velocities due to propagation of slow magneto - acoustic waves in the measurement of non - thermal velocities will be minimal .",
    "similarly , studies on measurement of plasma flows in the active region loops indicate temperature dependent flow speeds .",
    "measured absolute flow speeds to be less than 30 km s@xmath14 along the active region loops using similar spectral lines formed over temperature range of 0.62 mk .",
    "they found decrease in flow speeds with increase in temperature ( redshift to blueshift ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite also measured on an average doppler velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath14 from the edges of active regions .",
    "generally loops cross an active region in the east - west direction , so flows along the off - limb loops will either be directed toward or away from the observers line - of - sight ( if loops are not radially directed ) .",
    "this may lead to some enhancements in the line - width .",
    "however , as velocities in line - width measurements add in quadrature , contribution of doppler velocities due to plasma upflows ( @xmath35 km s@xmath14 , due to inclination of loops along the line - of - sight ) will again be minimal in the non - thermal velocities .",
    "moreover , there might be some enhancement in the non - thermal broadening due to these factors but given the range of errorbars ( 24 km s@xmath14 ) , their contribution can not be quantified .",
    "measurements on ar2 which were obtained after taking average over larger spatial length , shows enhancements in non - thermal velocities by @xmath36 km s@xmath14 as compared to measurements on ar1",
    ". this could possibly be the effect of different doppler shifted flows present along several different loop structures which were summed together to obtain the integrated profile , and thus , resulted in larger non - thermal velocities . henceforth , measured non - thermal velocities along ar2 can only be considered as an upper limit .",
    "as mentioned earlier , role of thermal conduction in the damping of slow magneto - acoustic waves is well known .",
    "one of the possibility of damping of alfvn waves would be that alfvn wave energy is being transferred to slow magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "these slow waves will further get easily dissipated via thermal conduction and will finally show up as temperature dependent damping of alfvn waves .",
    "studied wave energy conversion process in the non - linear ideal mhd framework .",
    "they demonstrated that wave energy can be converted from alfvn waves to slow magneto - acoustic waves near the region of corona where plasma-@xmath37 approaches unity .",
    "as contributions from slow magneto - acoustic waves in the current measurements of non - thermal velocities are minimal , henceforth , only the damping of alfvn waves can be inferred from the observed non - thermal velocities .",
    "we investigated off - limb active and quiet sun region using spectroscopic data from eis / hinode .",
    "we studied height dependence of basic plasma parameters such as intensity , electron number density , and non - thermal velocity along the active region and quiet sun .",
    "these estimated parameters enabled us to further study height dependence of alfvn wave energy flux in the both regions .",
    "main findings of our analysis are summarized as ,    * we identified several isolated spectral lines with good signal to noise ratio in the off - limb regions .",
    "these lines are formed at different temperatures and cover the temperature range of 1.12.8 mk .",
    "* we obtained electron densities and corresponding scale heights from different spectral line pairs which suggested that observed active and quiet sun regions are basically underdense with few measured exceptions from quiet sun region . *",
    "non - thermal velocities measured from warm spectral lines first showed increase with height and later showed either decrease or almost constant value with height in the far off - limb active region whereas hot lines showed gradual decrease with height .",
    "however , those measured from various spectral lines in the quiet sun region showed either gradual decrease or almost constant value with height .",
    "* calculated alfvn wave energy fluxes were similar to or slightly less than the energy required to maintain the active region corona .",
    "results also showed damping of alfvn wave energy flux with height .",
    "* we found damping lengths of alfvn wave energy flux ( @xmath26 ) to be in the range of 25 - 170 mm as measured from different spectral lines formed at different temperatures .",
    "* variation of damping lengths first showed increase and later decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "damping length peaked at around temperature of 1.78 mk in the both active and quiet sun regions .",
    "this work provides measurements of non - thermal velocities and alfvn wave energy fluxes at wide range of temperature .",
    "possible interpretation of these results would be either temperature dependent damping of alfvn waves or measurements along different coronal structures formed at different temperatures .",
    "possible temperature dependent damping may suggest some important role of thermal conduction in the damping of alfvn waves in the lower corona .",
    "this may even suggest some non - linear coupling between alfvn and slow mhd modes .",
    "we believe this to be an important result as this will provide more insight in to the dissipation mechanism of alfvn waves .",
    "recent 3-d mhd models of @xcite explained role of alfvn wave turbulence in the heating of solar chromosphere and corona .",
    "they predicted velocity amplitude of alfvn waves in the corona to be in the range of 20 - 40 km  s@xmath14 so as to maintain the typical active region loops . in our analysis , we found almost similar wave velocity amplitude in the active region .",
    "observed damping rate of alfvn wave energy flux with height is similar or slightly less than to the requirements of coronal active region .",
    "@xcite also measured non - thermal velocities in the range of 25 - 45 km  s@xmath14 using observation from eis / hinode along the on - disk individual coronal loop length .",
    "their findings were consistent with the predictions from alfvn wave turbulence model .",
    "however , we would also like to point out that model of @xcite still do not include effects of thermal conduction and radiative losses . therefore , at present , exact form of any relation between damping length of alfvn wave turbulence and temperature can not be comprehended . henceforth , these results demand for development of more sophisticated 3-d mhd models of alfvn wave propagation and dissipation including the effects of thermal conduction and non - linear coupling between various mhd modes in the solar atmosphere .",
