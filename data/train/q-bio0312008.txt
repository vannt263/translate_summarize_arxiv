    "microtubules are hollow , cylindrical polymers which perform several important functions inside the cell .",
    "the persistence length of a typical microtubule is of the order of mm @xcite , so they behave as rigid rods inside cells ( linear dimension @xmath3 ) .",
    "the basic monomer unit of a microtubule is a heterodimer of @xmath4 and @xmath5-tubulin . within a microtubule ,",
    "tubulin heterodimers are arranged head - to- tail to form linear protofilaments , usually 13 per tube .",
    "the length of a tubulin dimer is nearly 8 nm , and the total diameter of a microtubule is about 25 nm . heterodimers are oriented with their @xmath5-tubulin monomer pointing toward the plus end , or fast growing end , of the microtubule .",
    "the minus ends are at the microtubule - organizing centers such as centrosomes in animal cells .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5-tubulin binds gtp .",
    "following polymerization , the @xmath5-tubulin in the dimer hydrolyses its bound gtp to gdp @xcite .",
    "the hydrolyzed gdp - tubulin ( which we shall refer to as d - tubulin , while the un - hydrolyzed version shall be called t - tubulin ) does not polymerize , and the process is irreversible inside the microtubule . when the advancing hydrolysis front reaches the growing end of a microtubule , it starts de - polymerizing from the end and the protofilaments start peeling off , releasing the gdp - tubulin into solution . outside a microtubule ,",
    "reverse hydrolysis takes place and polymerization events start all over again .",
    "thus the microtubule constantly switches between phases of growth and shrinkage , and this behavior ( first observed in _ in vitro _",
    "experiments ) is called _ dynamical instability_@xcite .",
    "when a microtubule makes a transition from growing to shrinking state , it is said to undergo _ catastrophe _ and the reverse transition is called _",
    "rescue_. the relative rates of catastrophe and rescue , combined with the velocities of growth and shrinkage determine the character of a given population of microtubules @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic microtubule dynamics observed _ in vitro _",
    "is modified inside the cell by interaction with cellular factors that stabilize or destabilize microtubules , and which operate in both spatially and temporally specific ways to generate different types of microtubule assemblies during the cell cycle .",
    "proteins that modulate microtubule dynamics are called microtubule - associated proteins ( map ) .",
    "several maps have been identified , including map1 , map2 and tau in neurons and map4 in non - neuronal cells @xcite .",
    "maps regulate the microtubule dynamics through one or more of the following mechanisms : suppressing catastrophe rate , increasing rescue rate , promoting polymerization and preventing de - polymerization @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies show that , inside cells , dynamic instability of microtubules is observed predominantly near the cell margin .",
    "deep inside the cytoplasm , microtubules were observed to be in a state of almost persistent growth with very few catastrophe events .",
    "direct experimental measurements showed a marked difference between the rates of catastrophe in the cell interior ( @xmath6 ) and periphery ( @xmath7)[13 ] .",
    "these observations suggest that in the cell interior , microtubule growth is sustained by cellular factors which are presumably absent or rare near the cell boundary .",
    "our principal aim in this paper is to develop a simple mathematical model to study how the microtubule - associated proteins affect the dynamics of microtubule assembly .",
    "it is convenient to outline the main results of this paper at this point . by analyzing the rate equations associated with microtubule dynamics under a mean - field treatment of map density ,",
    "we show that the microtubule assembly can be in two different phases depending on the proportion of map to tubulin ( henceforth referred to as the map density ) inside the microtubule . above a critical density @xmath0 ,",
    "individual microtubules exist in a phase of unlimited growth , while below this density , growth is limited and the average length is finite . we show that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are rates of hydrolysis and growth respectively .",
    "the rates of catastrophe and rescue are related to @xmath11 through the relations @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the rate of shrinkage .",
    "numerical simulations show that the fluctuations in map distribution do not signficantly affect the predictions based on mean - field analysis .",
    "we compare our results to experimental observations on the effects of map on microtubules , and find that there is qualitative agreement .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "in the next section , we briefly discuss the salient features of our model and its limitations.in sec .",
    "3 , we write down explicitly the rate equations that govern the dynamics of the microtubule assembly . we derive expressions for the critical map density , the time evolution of the average length of microtubules in the unlimited growth regime as well as the expressions for the rates of catastrophe and rescue in our model . in sec.4",
    ", we present results of numerical simulations of our model which are in excellent agreement with the analytical predictions . in sec.5 , we summarise our results and outline the main conclusions that emerges out of this study .",
    "in this model , we assume that microtubules are thin rigid rods nucleating from the microtubule - organizing center , which is very often the centrosome(fig.1 ) . the three - dimensional structure of microtubules is ignored in our model .",
    "the centrosome contains nucleation sites for a microtubule , and nucleation takes place at vacant sites at a rate @xmath15 .",
    "the microtubule grows by adding tubulin subunits at a rate @xmath16 , and tubulin units inside the microtubule are stochastically hydrolyzed at a rate @xmath17 .",
    "a microtubule will start de - polymerizing when the t - tubulin at its growing end is hydrolyzed to d - tubulin @xcite .",
    "the shrinkage takes place at a rate @xmath14 , which is the probability per unit time to lose a subunit .",
    "it is generally assumed that the de - polymerization process will continue along the length of the microtubule , until the shrinking end encounters a patch of t - tubulin in the interior . in our model , however , we assume that a microtubule in shortening state will continue to shrink ( irrespective of the state of tubulin in the interior ) until the de - polymerizing end encounters a map , which are present along the microtubule .",
    "this simplification helps focus on the role of maps in the microtubule dynamics .",
    "we further assume that maps also assist in the polymerization process by acting as polymerization sites along a microtubule .",
    "for further simplification , we assume the presence of an excess of free tubulin in solution , so that the dynamics of the tubulin concentration can be largely ignored .",
    "we also assume that the nucleation sites in the centrosome are spaced sufficiently far apart so that the effective interaction between microtubules through local depletion and enhancement of concentration of free tubulin is insignificant .",
    "a schematic illustration of the dynamics of our model is given in fig.2 , and a schematic illustration of the various rates of the model is shown in fig.3 .",
    "it is helpful to note the typical experimental values of the various parameters in our model .",
    "we refer to recent experimental work @xcite for most of the parameter values .",
    "nucleation of microtubules in the centrosome was seen to occur at a rate of @xmath18 5 - 6/min _ in vivo _",
    "the velocity of growth of growing microtubules observed is @xmath19 .",
    "the rate of addition of tubulin dimers ( @xmath10 ) is determined from @xmath20 as follows .",
    "a tubulin dimer has length @xmath21 .",
    "since there are 13 protofilaments of t - dimers in a single microtubule , each tubulin contributes a length of @xmath22 to the microtubule .",
    "thus , the rate of addition of tubulin dimers would be @xmath23 .",
    "using similar reasoning , the rate of loss of tubulin can be calculated from the measured velocity of shrinkage in shortening microtubules .",
    "this turns out be @xmath24 .",
    "the rate of hydrolysis is a difficult parameter to measure , and is not as well known as the other rates .",
    "however , a wide range of values , 0.25 - 25/min has been reported @xcite .",
    "the typical values of the density @xmath11 of map used in injection experiments are estimated to be of the order @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we analyze the mean - field rate equations for the time evolution of the probability distribution of the lengths of microtubules . since our basic aim is to study the character of an assembly of microtubules , we resort to a statistical description . the most appropriate quantity to study in this perspective",
    "is the length distribution @xmath26 , which is the fraction of nucleation sites which has a microtubule of length @xmath27 at time @xmath28 .",
    "the presence of map is taken into account through a mean - field density variable @xmath11 , whose local fluctuations in space is ignored ( the effect of these fluctuations are explicitly studied in numerical simulations presented in sec.4 ) .",
    "the maps change the microtubule dynamics by modifying the rates of shrinkage and hydrolysis , as seen below .",
    "it is also convenient to classify the entire set of microtubules into two : growing and shrinking microtubules ( as was done in @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the complete length distribution @xmath26 can also be split as follows .",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath30 is the fraction of microtubule in growing state at any time @xmath28 , and @xmath31 is the fraction in shrinking state at time @xmath28 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath30 is described by the following equation ( for @xmath32 ) :      the significance of each term easily follows from the model description in sec.2 .",
    "the first two terms represent _ gain _ events , where a microtubule of length @xmath27 in growing state is created at time @xmath28 . in particular",
    ", the second term describes the transition between a microtubule in a shrinking state to a growing state , and so    @xmath34    is the rate of _ rescue _ in our model .",
    "we note that in our model @xmath35 as @xmath36 , which is in agreement with the assumptions of our model .",
    "( however , in experiments , microtubules have been observed to undergo rescue under _ in vitro _",
    "conditions in the absence of map .",
    "our assumption here is that the map significantly increases the rescue frequency , which would otherwise be negligible ) .",
    "the last two terms represent the _ loss _ events where a microtubule of length @xmath27 either adds a tubulin to increase its length , or undergoes hydrolysis to transform into shrinking state .",
    "the latter is an event of _ catastrophe _ , and so the corresponding rate in our model is    @xmath37    both the rates of catastrophe and rescue are parameters which are measured in experiments .",
    "we also note that for microtubules of unit length , the gain event in @xmath38 is nucleation , rather than polymerization , so that its equation is    @xmath39 \\label{eq : rate1+}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 $ ] is the fraction of vacant sites in the lattice at time @xmath28 .",
    "the equation for @xmath31 is ,    @xmath41    the equations eq.([eq : rate1 ] ) and eq.([eq : rate2 ] ) are supplemented by the boundary condition for @xmath26 , which is ,    @xmath42    we now proceed to look for the solution for these coupled set of rate equations . as a first step , we look for the steady state solution by putting the time derivatives to zero in eq.([eq : rate1 ] ) and eq.([eq : rate2 ] ) .      in the steady state , it is reasonable to assume that both the distributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( the time dependence has been dropped since we are looking at steady state solutions now ) have the same dependence on @xmath27 .",
    "further , it is easily seen from the equations that the steady state solution has an exponential form , which is easily determined by substituting the trial functions    @xmath45    in the steady state equations . in the trial solution , @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath47 are two unknown constants which need to be determined , and @xmath48 is the normalization factor .",
    "upon substitution in eq.([eq : trial ] ) we find the following equations for the unknown constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath49+\\gamma p_{s}\\rho e^{-\\lambda}=p_{h}(1-\\rho)=p_{s } \\gamma[1-(1-\\rho)e^{-\\lambda})]\\ ] ]    from which we determine the unknown constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 as follows .",
    "clearly , from the boundary condition in eq([eq : boundary ] ) , the solution is meaningful only if @xmath51 , and this implies that @xmath52 , where    @xmath53    it turns out that @xmath0 is a critical value of map density , below which growth is bounded and the length distribution of microtubule is stationary .",
    "the typical values of @xmath0 can be easily estimated using the known values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "for example , keeping @xmath54 and changing @xmath17 from @xmath55 3/min to 300/min ( which are close to _ in vivo _ estimates ) gives @xmath0 in the interval @xmath56 .",
    "this suggests that a very small map to tubulin ratio might be enough to stabilize microtubules against depolymerization .",
    "the steady state solution discussed above is not valid when @xmath57 , and so the solution for the rate equations has to be found explicitly for this case .",
    "when @xmath2 , growth becomes unbounded .",
    "although the exact solution of the evolution equations in this regime is hard to find , it is helpful to note that under usual experimental conditions the growth and shrinkage rates far exceed the hydrolysis rate , i.e.,@xmath17 is small in comparison with @xmath16 and @xmath14 . if we further assume that we work in the regime where the map density is high , i.e. , @xmath58 , then all the terms in the rate equations which contain @xmath17 can be neglected in comparison with the other terms .",
    "further analytic progress is now possible by converting the finite difference equations into differential equations ( in the limit @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is done by formally expanding @xmath60 in its derivatives ( see the appendix for a discussion on this point ) as the series , @xmath61 .",
    "after substitution , we arrive at the following differential equation for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath62    let us now define the re - scaled time @xmath63 and the new variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in terms of which eq.([eq : cont - minus ] ) is re - cast as    @xmath66    this equation is easily solved by substituting @xmath67 , upon which we find that @xmath68 satisfies the equation @xmath69 , which is the well - known equation for diffusion of a particle in one dimension , with a drift term .",
    "the solution of this equation ( apart from the trivial solution @xmath70 ) has the form(up to a proportionality factor ) ,    @xmath71    however , this solution is not physically reasonable since the mean length decreases with time as @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that in this limit , the solution for eq.([eq : cont - minus ] ) is the trivial solution i.e , @xmath73 .",
    "the equation for @xmath30 in the same limit is ,    @xmath74    which , again , is the diffusion equation with a drift term , whose solution is ( up to a constant )    @xmath75    we see that in the limits @xmath76 and @xmath58 , the length distribution of growing microtubules is a gaussian at all times , and the mean value increases linearly with time as @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , in this limit , almost all the microtubules are in the growing state .",
    "although it is possible at this stage to look for a perturbative solution of the evolution equations eq.([eq : cont - minus ] ) and eq.([eq : cont - plus ] ) with @xmath78 as the pertrubation parameter , we have not attempted this here .",
    "rather , in the next subsection , we determine the mean length as a function of time exactly , and shows that it agrees with the prediction of eq.([eq : cont - plus - solution ] ) in the limit @xmath76 .      in order to study the time evolution of the average length in the unbounded growth regime , it is convenient to define the following quantities :    @xmath79    which is the fraction of microtubule in growing state , irrespective of length , and    @xmath80    is the fraction of microtubule in shrinking state , irrespective of length .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath81 can be found by performing a sum of eq .",

    "the average length of microtubule at time @xmath28 is defined as    @xmath87\\ ] ]    the rate of change of @xmath88 with time may be expressed in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath83 , since each growing microtubule grows by an amount @xmath16 and each shrinking microtubule shrinks by an amount @xmath14 per unit time .",
    "it follows that    @xmath89    to calculate @xmath81 and @xmath83 from eq.([eq : q+ ] ) and eq.([eq : q- ] ) , let us first assume that @xmath90 .",
    "this assumption is valid in the unbounded growth regime , where the mean length increases with time , and hence the peak of the distribution is expected to shift toward larger and larger times ( note the shifting gaussian we found in the last section ) .",
    "the result is a closed set of equations for @xmath81 and @xmath83 , which has the form    @xmath91    and    @xmath92    where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we take the initial condition to be @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the general solution for the above set of equations is    @xmath97    and @xmath98    we note that the exponential terms vanish at sufficiently late times , and so the asymptotic forms of @xmath81 and @xmath83 are ,    @xmath99    thus , even in the unbounded growth phase , a finite fraction of microtubule will be in the shrinking state .",
    "after substituting eq.([eq : q+- ] ) in eq.([eq : dldt ] ) , we find that      for unbounded growth , we need @xmath101 , for which the condition @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is defined in eq.([eq : rhoc ] ) .",
    "this calculation confirms that @xmath0 is the critical map density above which microtubules exist in a phase of sustained growth . in the limit @xmath76",
    ", we see that @xmath102 , which is one of the results we had derived in the last subsection .      at this stage , it is worthwhile to compare our predictions ( although based on a very simple model ) with experimental observations regarding the effect of maps on microtubules@xcite .",
    "we specifically refer to experiments by dhamodharan and wadsworth @xcite where maps were microinjected into bsc-1 cells and their effects on growth of microtubules , in particular , the changes in catstrophe and rescue frequencies , were studied .",
    "when 0.1 mg / ml of map-2 was added to the cells , the proportion of map to tubulin in the polymerized state was estimated to be nearly 1:25 , or @xmath103 .",
    "increasing the map concentration 10-fold was observed to decrease the catastrophe frequency from 0.05 ( @xmath104)@xmath105 to 0.02 ( @xmath106)@xmath105 , i.e. , by a factor of nearly 0.4 after neglecting the experimental error . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cat - rate ] ) , increasing @xmath11 by a factor of 10 , from 0.04 to 0.4 , would decrease the catastrophe frequency by a factor of 0.625 , which is in resonably good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "furthermore , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cat - rate ] ) , the catastrophe rate in the absence of map is simply the hydrolysis rate @xmath17 , which may be calculated from the same equation using experimental data for @xmath107 and @xmath11 .",
    "the data for @xmath108 ( which has greater accuracy ) gives @xmath109 , which is , again , in reasonably good agreement with the experimental value of 0.043 ( @xmath110 ) @xmath105 .",
    "the effects of map on the rescue frequency is more subtle , since rescue would occur in cells even in the absence of map , which is not taken into account in our model .",
    "in this section , we discuss the results of our numerical simulations of the microtubule assembly . since our model neglects any effective interaction between growth of neighboring microtubules due to local depletion of ligand concentration , the geometry of the system , and the spacing between individual microtubules is unimportant in the simulation . for simplicity , the cell interior is imagined as a rectangular box , where the base forms the substrate for nucleation of microtubules @xcite .",
    "the microtubules grow in the direction perpendicular to the base until they hit the boundary .",
    "the next step in the simulation procedure is to divide the box into a grid array of dimensions @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the length of the side of the substrate and @xmath113 is the height . as we had mentioned before , the lattice spacing in the substrate is unimportant as long as it is sufficiently large that direct interaction between neighboring microtubules could be ignored ( henceforth , we shall always assume that this condition is satisfied ) .",
    "the lattice spacing in the direction of growth ( @xmath114-axis ) is the length of one tubulin dimer , which , after taking into account the number of protofilaments , is equivalent to @xmath115 . for the time evolution",
    ", we choose monte carlo step as equivalent to @xmath116 . with this timescale , the probability of a microtubule growing by one unit per mc step is nearly 0.55 , and the probability that a tubulin unit is lost in one mc step is nearly 0.82 , from the rates discussed in sec .",
    "2 . in other words ,",
    "the time scale has been chosen such that growth and shrinkage of microtubules are stochastic events , in accordance with the rate equations .",
    "for the lattice size , we chose @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the tubulin density _ in polymerized state _ at each point in space is represented using a density index @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the substrate co - ordinate , @xmath114 is the position in the direction of growth and @xmath28 is time in units of mc steps . at @xmath121 , we start with a substrate free of microtubule , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "we do not explicitly keep track of the density of free tubulin in the solution .",
    "the density index @xmath119 takes three values : @xmath123 represents t - tubulin , @xmath124 represents d - tubulin and @xmath125 implies that the site is empty . a string of @xmath126 at any @xmath120 , for @xmath127 is a microtubule of length @xmath27 . for @xmath128 ,",
    "@xmath119 changes from 0 to @xmath129 with probability @xmath15 per mc step at all @xmath120 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is the nucleation event . for any @xmath130",
    ", this transition takes place with probability @xmath10 , which is a polymerization event where a new t - tubulin dimer is added to the microtubule .",
    "the location of map in the lattice is specified through another density index @xmath131 , which takes the value 1 or 0 depending on whether there is a map molecule at the lattice site ( * r*,z ) at time t. at all times , we distribute the maps at random throughout the lattice with mean density @xmath11 .",
    "we do not take into account the diffusion of maps in solution explicitly .",
    "rather , when microtubules grow from the substrate , they assimilate the maps along their length and release them randomly such that the mean density remains @xmath11 at all times .",
    "we assume here that the binding and release of map take place over time scales much less than one 1mc step in the simulation ( which is equivalent to @xmath132 seconds ) , so that , at each time step , the microtubule assembly has a different map configuration .    in all our simulations ,",
    "the rates of growth and shrinkage were fixed as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which are the experimental values quoted in sec.2 . for reasons we shall shortly discuss ,",
    "the hydrolysis rate was fixed at a value higher than the typical estimates , i.e , we chose @xmath135 ( which would translate into a hydrolysis rate of @xmath136/minute ) .",
    "we also chose a high nucleation rate ( @xmath137 ) , for two reasons : to increase the occupancy of the lattice so as to improve the statistics , and to reduce the duration of the early - time regime of growth ( where the exponential factors in eq .. ([eq : earlyq- ] ) and eq .. ([earlyq+ ] ) would ne non - negligible ) .",
    "the chosen values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 gives a convenient value of the critical map density , @xmath138 ( which was the primary reason for choosing a high @xmath17 ) .",
    "we measured the length distribution and average length of microtubule assembly for three values of @xmath11 , 0.1 , 0.3 and 0.6 .",
    "we chose the first two values to be below @xmath0 , where we expect bounded growth ( steady state distribution ) and the last value is above @xmath0 , where growth is expected to be unbounded .",
    "the results for probability distribution of lengths are given in figs .",
    "4 - 6 , and the result for time evolution of the average length in the unbounded regime is displayed in fig.7 . in fig . 4 and 5",
    ", we observe that , as predicted by the rate equation analysis , the solution is exponential , but the measured value of @xmath46 differs from the mean - field prediction .",
    "this is presumably due to the spatial fluctuations in the map density , which is ignored in the mean - field analysis .",
    "in fig.6 , we find that the length distribution of microtubules in the unbounded regime closely resembles a gaussian function with a mean value shifting with time .",
    "this is in accordance with the results of rate equation analysis in sec . 3 ( although in the simulations @xmath17 and @xmath14 are of the same order of magnitude ) . in fig.7",
    ", we confirm that the mean length in the unbounded regime follows a linear dependence on time , again in agreement with the analysis in sec.3 .",
    "in this work , we have presented a simple theoretical model of stabilization of microtubules due to microtubule - associated proteins .",
    "we have shown that when the density of map is reduced below a critical value , the length distribution of the microtubule assembly undergoes a significant change .",
    "whereas in one phase ( at high map density ) the microtubules extend throughout the cell , in the other phase they have an exponentially decaying length distribution with a finite average length .",
    "it is interesting to note that this transition is similar to the transition at mitosis in real cells , where phosphorylation of maps by agents such as the metaphase promoting factor ( mpf)@xcite leads to a weakening of their binding to the microtubules , and a consequent change in length distribution .",
    "we have also shown that the critical ratio of map to polymerized tubulin required for a transition to the cell - spanning phase can be as low as 1:1000 under _ in vivo _ conditions .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that even a very small concentration of map can sustain unlimited growth of microtubules , which is in qualitative agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "there are still many open questions regarding the effect of maps on microtubule dynamics in cells .",
    "in fact , maps which inhibit polymerization have also been identified recently @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to include such maps also in our model and look for the consequences of competition between the effects of two kinds of map .",
    "moreover , our prediction of the existence of a critical map density which differentiates between two distinct growth regimes for microtubules could be verified in future experiments .",
    "lastly , our model could be still improved by including effects of local fluctuations in the concentrations of map and tubulin . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to ask in the context of such an improved model whether there exists subpopulations of microtubules in one growth regime , while the over - all growth behavior of the whole population is in the other regime .",
    "these are some of the questions we would like to address in the future .",

    "<S> maps are assumed to bind to the microtubule filaments , thus preventing their disintegration following hydrolysis and enhancing further polymerization . using mean - field rate equations and explicit numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the density of map ( number of map per tubulin in the microtubule ) has to exceed a critical value @xmath0 to stabilize the structure against de - polymerization . at lower densities @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the microtubule population consists mostly of short polymers with exponentially decaying length distribution , whereas at @xmath2 the average length increases linearly with time and the microtubules ultimately extend to the cell boundary . using experimentally measured values of various parameters , the critical ratio of map to tubulin required for unlimited growth </S>",
