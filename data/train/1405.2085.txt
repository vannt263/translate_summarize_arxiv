    "the first stars formed in the primordial chemical environment of the early universe , when all baryons were remnants of the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the metallicity was zero ( except for a trace amount of lithium and beryllium ) , and therefore the first stars are also identified as zero - metallicity , or pop iii , stars .",
    "these stars were born primarily inside minihalos , the first collapsed cosmological halos with @xmath8 .",
    "the formation , evolution and death of these stars gradually enriched the environment with metals , allowing the formation of pop ii stars when metallicity reached about @xmath9 of solar metallicity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . both pop ii and iii stars emit ultraviolet photons capable of ionizing the surrounding hydrogen and helium atoms , and thus early formation epoch also marks the cosmic dawn ( cd ) and the beginning of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) .",
    "the evolution of this high - redshift astrophysics is marked conveniently by three prominent epochs : ( 1 ) the ly@xmath10 -pumping epoch , when the igm is strongly coupled to the gas kinetic temperature ( @xmath11 ) through the wouthysen - field effect with high ly@xmath10 intensity , ( 2 ) the x - ray heating epoch , when the igm is heated to beyond @xmath12 , the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the x - ray heating and ( 3 ) the main eor , when h ii bubbles in cosmological scales form in a patchy way .",
    "it is generally believed that the cd commences with the the ly@xmath10-pumping epoch , followed by the x - ray heating epoch , and finally occurs the eor , whose sequence is rather robust unless 1 - 2 order - of - magnitude changes in the fiducial astrophysical parameters are allowed @xcite .",
    "while this might be true , the recent development in the theory of the first - star formation and the subsequent x - ray - source formation brings a new possibility that the x - ray heating epoch may have started earlier than previously thought , as we describe below .    early theoretical work on the formation of the first stars , mostly through high resolution simulations , found that pop iii stars with mass @xmath13 are born in isolation inside minihalos , and thus the `` one massive pop iii star per minihalo '' paradigm was established ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "later , however , several higher - resolution simulations began to observe the formation of binary protostar systems with a smaller mass range , @xmath14\\ , m_{\\odot}$ ] ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the universality of the latter finding is in doubt ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite",
    "; see also @xcite for the formation of pop iii stars inside more massive halos ) , it certainly introduces very important subtleties to the old paradigm .",
    "one important aspect is that x - ray binary systems may remain after some of these stars die , and can emit x - rays very efficiently ( we will quantify their x - ray emissivity in section  [ sec:21cm_rarepeak ] ) through gas accretion rate comparable to the eddington limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "this then could make the x - ray heating epoch occur earlier than previously thought , or even allow a model where the reionization is dominated by x - ray photons instead of uv photons .",
    "reionization dominated by x - ray photons , due to their long mean free path , will occur much more smoothly in space than reionization by uv photons ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , x - rays can heat the igm ( see e.g. recent observational signature reported by @xcite ) , which impacts the dynamics of the igm ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath0 of igm ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high - redshift x - ray binaries seem to dominate the x - ray background over the active galactic nuclei at the late stage of eor ( @xmath15 ) , if their emissivity and sed is calibrated by the observed , low-@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "it is important to study the observational aspect of this new scenario of the formation and evolution of the pop iii objects during the cd . because of short lifetime of these objects ( e.g. pop iii stars with mass @xmath18",
    "live for less than a few million years ) , direct observation should aim a very high redshift range . among many , one of the most sought - after probes of such high redshift objects",
    "is the observation of the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen , because it can probe the igm structure and the impact from the early radiation sources simultaneously .",
    "this is the main science goal of the next - generation radio telescopes ( e.g. lofar - low frequency array , mwa - murchison widefield array , paper - precision array for probing the epoch of reionization , hera - the hydrogen epoch of reionization array , ska - square kilometre array , etc . ) .",
    "the 21 cm observation will be driven mainly in two ways : the power spectrum analysis and the real - space tomography ( 3d imaging ) .",
    "the power spectrum analysis has the merit of achieving relatively high sensitivity by stacking many wavemodes at an equal radius in the fourier space ( @xcite and references therein ) , and thus is possible with ska precursors ( lofar , mwa , paper , hera ) .",
    "using the anisotropy due to the redshift - space distortion , the power spectrum analysis can even allow separation of the cosmological information from the astrophysical information ( bl ; @xcite : msmika hereafter ) during the early epoch of cosmic reionization .",
    "nevertheless , the real - space tomography should be carried out eventually to obtain more information for the generically non - gaussian field , which will become practical with ska , the highest - sensitivity radio apparatus .",
    "predictions have been made on the possible tomography of individual high - redshift objects during the cd , which is also the focus of this paper .",
    "when uv sources are embedded in the igm colder than the cmb , a `` ly@xmath10 sphere '' forms around them and the 21-cm absorption trough forms .",
    "when these uv sources are accompanied by x - ray sources , the central regions is heated to be observed in emission but is still surrounded by the absorption trough against the cmb continuum ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . because this feature is not likely to form during the main eor phase when x - ray heating is efficient everywhere and the patchy h ii regions dominate the signal",
    ", the ly@xmath10 sphere can be a smoking gun for the very early astrophysical objects .",
    "tomography of the signature of a single pop iii star ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) is practically impossible at this stage even with ska , because its zone of influence on the igm is too small to be observed with reasonable sensitivity . observing a quasar system with a supermassive black hole @xcite seems more promising , because the zone of influence is much more extended than that of a single star and thus guarantees much better detectability .",
    "nevertheless , the number density of high - redshift quasar systems are calculated under an ad - hoc assumption @xcite , and thus the required volume of observation ( field - of - view @xmath19 redshift - range ) is uncertain .    in this paper , instead of a single star , galaxy , or a quasar system ,",
    "we examine a system of highly clustered galaxies hosting pop iii and ii stars together with the x - ray binaries , which have many observational merits as follows .",
    "rare , high - density peaks in the universe are a good site for pop iii and ii stars to form and get clustered , and the number density of such peaks can be easily calculated under a fixed density - filtering scale .",
    "because they form much earlier than more average peaks under a given filtering ( or mass ) scale , these high - density peaks may stand out as almost - isolated objects until other smaller - scale objects start to become abundant .",
    "moreover , strong clustering of radiation sources may extend their zone of influence to the extent that is observable by the 21 cm tomography .",
    "how the impact of x - ray binaries associated with the death of binary pop iii stars will be seen in 21 cm is also of prime interest , as it involves a new development in the theory of first star formation and may affect how cosmic reionization progressed .",
    "observation of such a signature will allow constraining a few physical parameters of high - redshift radiation sources , such as their spectral energy distribution , uv and x - ray emissivity , and their clustering scales .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the impact of the sed of high - redshift x - ray binaries , and concluded that a very hard sed case would result in very uniform heating of the igm , such that the resulting 21-cm fluctuation during the x - ray heating epoch may be much smaller than previously estimated .",
    "high - redshift x - ray binaries surely increase model uncertainties and can affect the high - redshift 21-cm observations @xcite .",
    "we study the observational signature of highly clustered population iii and ii stars and pop iii x - ray binaries inside `` rarepeak '' , a rare and high - density environment , within which the formation and evolution of both pop iii and ii stars and their uv radiative feedback on the igm has been simulated up to @xmath20 inside a @xmath21 box ( @xcite , xwn hereafter ) , with a particular focus on the 21-cm differential brightness temperature with respect to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "radiation from pop iii x - ray binaries was included in this box in postprocessing , in order to determine the temperature and ionization states of igm ( @xcite , xawno hereafter ) , which we use to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "while the 21-cm signature of individual sources has been studied for individual or composite first stars , galaxies and black hole systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , rarepeak is unique in that ( 1 ) it is much more realistic than the idealized , spherically - symmetric geometries considered in previous work , ( 2 ) it has a very large volume , @xmath22 comoving , and mass , @xmath23 , as a single clustered object at @xmath20 which would seed a small proto galaxy cluster later ( for example , at @xmath24 , two @xmath25 halos appear inside rarepeak in addition to many smaller galaxies ) and ( 3 ) has a relatively large mean overdensity , @xmath26 at @xmath27 , which amplifies the 21-cm signal .",
    "we investigate whether the last two factors will combine to open a new observational window for detecting high - redshift objects .",
    "as shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the existence of a ly@xmath10 sphere with a strong absorption trough of @xmath28 around these sources seems ubiquitous .",
    "however , x - ray binary systems may be very efficient in heating the igm before the absorption trough occurs , which we also investigate here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : simulation ] , we briefly describe the numerical simulation of rarepeak and how we calculate the inhomogeneous ly@xmath10 and x - ray background , which determine @xmath29 .",
    "we also describe the parametrization of the x - ray sed . in section [ sec:21cm_rarepeak ] , we describe the characteristics of the calculated @xmath0 field . in section",
    "[ sec : detectability ] , we present our forecasts for 21-cm observations of rarepeak , by tomography ( section [ sub : tomography ] ) and power spectrum analysis ( section [ sub : power - spectrum - analysis ] ) .",
    "we conclude this work with a summary and a discussion on observational prospects and some concerns on high - redshift 21-cm cosmology with regard to our result in section [ discussion ] .",
    "appendix is added to describe the detailed scheme we developed and used for calculating @xmath0 inside the observing data cube for the most generic cases with finite optical depth and peculiar velocity .",
    "rarepeak is a local density maximum whose mean density is significantly larger than the average density , and thus biased formation of population iii and ii stars occurs at all times .",
    "xwn performed a simulation of the formation and uv radiation feedback of pop iii and ii stars in rarepeak from @xmath30 to @xmath20 , using the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code enzo ( @xcite ) and ray - tracing method for uv transfer moray ( @xcite ) .",
    "a cubic , comoving , periodic box of volume @xmath31 was used , with a @xmath32 root grid resolution and three levels of static nested grids centered on this high density region ( see xwn for details ) .",
    "the first run was a pure n - body simulation with @xmath32 particles , which ran from @xmath30 to @xmath24 .",
    "then , a lagrangian volume ( cuboid ) containing two @xmath33 halos at @xmath24 was selected , and the simulation restarted now with three more static nested grids to have an effective resolution of @xmath34 and an effective dark matter mass resolution of @xmath35 inside the highest nested grid covering a comoving volume of @xmath36 .",
    "we call this region `` rarepeak '' . inside",
    "rarepeak , identifying halos with @xmath37 or more dark matter particles , the minimum halo mass resolved is @xmath38 .",
    "this halo mass resolution seems good enough to cover the whole range of star - forming halos : a finer - resolution simulation with the minimum halo mass of @xmath39 still finds that stars are forming only inside halos of mass greater than @xmath40 @xcite . depending upon the refinement criteria @xcite , a maximum refinement of level @xmath41 was allowed , resulting in a maximum resolution of 19 comoving pc .",
    "this lagrangian volume has , at @xmath20 , a comoving volume of @xmath42 which is a @xmath43 density peak under the corresponding filtering scale ( see also section  [ sub : power - spectrum - analysis ] ) . at this time , this region contains more than 10000 pop iii stars and remnants distributed over 3000 halos , most of which are more massive than @xmath44 .",
    "together with the simulation of the structure formation , the transfer of h- and he - ionizing photons from all the pop iii and pop ii stars and calculating the ionization fractions with a rate solver are all carried out simultaneously .",
    "hydrodynamics is also carried out self - consistently to follow the evolution of density , temperature and velocity fields . in xwn and xawno ,",
    "a star particle is formed when the star formation criterion is met ( see xwn , xawno and @xcite for details ) . if a grid cell containing the star particle has metallicity [ z / h]@xmath45 , the particle becomes a pop iii star ( or a pop iii binary system ) whose mass is a randomly chosen sample from an initial mass function ( imf ) given by @xmath46 dm , \\label{eq : popiii_imf}\\ ] ] and the star particle becomes a pop ii stellar cluster otherwise .",
    "here the characteristic mass for the pop iii imf , @xmath47 , is taken as @xmath48 .",
    "based on this simulation , we calculate the impact of x - ray binaries as follows .",
    "first , we assume that 50% of the pop iii star particles form x - ray binary systems .",
    "then , the initial black hole is assigned a mass of @xmath48 or @xmath49 , if the mass of the star particle satisfies @xmath50 or @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the black hole then accrets matter of the companion star at the eddington limit during the lifetime of the star @xmath52 , such that the luminosity becomes @xmath53 with radiation efficiency @xmath54 and the black hole mass grows from the initial value , @xmath55 , by @xmath56 where the eddington time @xmath57 .",
    "the total accreted mass becomes @xmath58 .",
    "the under - resolved region outside rarepeak , which in fact takes almost all the simulation volume , is populated by uv and x - ray sources as follows .",
    "inside rarepeak , we project the uv ( x - ray ) luminosity and baryon density to the root grid of @xmath32 cells . among all the cells , we sample only those containing uv ( x - ray ) sources and obtain the average uv ( x - ray ) luminosity @xmath59 and the baryon density @xmath60 .",
    "then , all the cells with density higher than @xmath60 are assigned the uv ( x - ray ) luminosity of @xmath59 .",
    "the net luminosity of the simulation box is found to be dominated by these new sources over the rarepeak by a factor of @xmath61 depending on the redshift .",
    "updating the net uv and x - ray luminosities this way are very important in estimating the ly@xmath10 background intensity and x - ray heating rate + secondary ly@xmath10 pumping , respectively ( section  [ sec : rt_x_lya ] ) .",
    "we assume two types of rest - frame seds for x - rays .",
    "the first type is a simple monochromatic sed , given by luminosity @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the bolometric x - ray luminosity and is multiplied by the dirac delta function centered at frequency @xmath65 .",
    "we use a constant @xmath63 such that the number of x - ray photons is inversely proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "the second type is a composite power - law sed @xmath66 where again the bolometric luminosity @xmath67 is set to equal the constant value @xmath63 . for the first type",
    ", we parametrize @xmath65 to observe the impact of the x - ray energy : @xmath68\\{0.3 , 0.5 , 0.77 , 1 , 3 } kev . for the second type ,",
    "we use five bands of above frequencies @xmath69 with luminosities weighted by \\{0.134 , 0.125 , 0.089 , 0.219 , 0.433 } , respectively . the photo - heating and photo - ionization by x - ray photons",
    "are calculated by correctly implementing the build - up of x - ray background .",
    "we calculate all quantities locally , by calculating physical quantities within the entire simulated volume on a @xmath70-cell uniform grid .",
    "we explicitly calculate the two crucial , locally - varying , radiation fields : the proper ly@xmath10 number intensity @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and the proper x - ray intensity @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) as follows ( similar to the calculation of lyman - werner background by @xcite ) .",
    "first , ly@xmath10 photons can be generated both by redshifted uv continuum below the lyman limit frequency and by collisional excitation of hi atoms heated by x - ray photons : let us denote the number intensity of the former by @xmath75 and of the latter by @xmath76 . a point source with the rest - frame photon number luminosity @xmath77 at the source frequency @xmath78 ( below the lyman limit ) , the comoving coordinate position @xmath79 and the source redshift @xmath80 will generate , at a comoving coordinate position @xmath81 and an observing redshift @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the principal quantum number and the luminosity distance @xmath85 is given in terms of the comoving distance @xmath86 $ ] as @xmath87 in the above , @xmath88 is the recycling rate of a source photon with @xmath89 , when it is redshifted to the nearest lyman resonance frequency @xmath90 at @xmath91 ( we use @xmath88 calculated by @xcite ) , being recycled to a ly@xmath10 photon by subsequent cascades and multiple scatterings .",
    "this is then multiplied by the heaviside function @xmath92 ( @xmath93 if @xmath94 ; @xmath95 otherwise ) , indicating the redshift of @xmath96 to @xmath97 at @xmath16 without being absorbed by the higher resonance frequency @xmath98 .",
    "this `` dark screen '' effect generates the well - known step - wise profile of @xmath99 decreasing more rapidly than @xmath100 .",
    "we truncate the summation at @xmath101 , which is a rough estimation of the impact of local ionization by a source ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then calculate the net intensity , @xmath102 , by summing contributions from all the sources inside and outside the box : we attach the simulated boxes periodically for the latter , and we consider the time dilation such that boxes use progressively older snapshots as look - back time increases .",
    "the calculation is accelerated by using the fast - fourier - transform scheme for discretized look - back time contributions .",
    "we find that the out - of - box contribution becomes nearly uniform while the inhomogeneity of the radiation field is dominated by the inside - the - box contribution .",
    "of course , modes of fluctuation with wavelengths larger than the simulaton box is not this periodic , and realizing these modes in our simulation is impossible .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuation of long mean - free - path radiation fields is usually dominated by nearby sources ( e.g. lyman - werner fluctuation compiled by @xcite ) , and thus we simply use the scheme described above .",
    "second , we calculate the x - ray intensity field @xmath103 in the same manner for time dilation and periodicity as in obtaining @xmath104 , by summing over the point - source contribution @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the source luminosity ( @xmath107 ) in the x - ray band , and an appropriate calculation of the x - ray optical depth @xmath108 is made ( xawno ) .",
    "finally , @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 , given only by local ionized fraction @xmath112 , is the fraction of the primary electron s energy going into the secondary excitation of hi ( @xcite ) , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the number density , the ionization energy and the absorption cross section of species @xmath116 ( = h i , he i , he ii ) , respectively , @xmath117 is the hubble constant at @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the planck constant , and @xmath120 is the hi ly@xmath10 frequency ( we neglect he ii contribution though , due to low ionization states at @xmath121 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2ndlya ] ) is the result of the fact that the originally line - centered ly@xmath10 photons created by the secondary excitation at a rate @xmath122 is balanced by the photons being redshifted out of the line center at a rate @xmath123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the total intensity , @xmath124 , to calculate ly@xmath10 pumping of the 21 cm lines . with the background x - ray intensity @xmath103 , which includes all the sources inside and outside the box by properly treating the redshifting of photons and time dilation , we calculate and `` update '' the kinetic temperature @xmath11 and the electron fraction @xmath112 to include secondary ionizations ( xawno ) .",
    "@xmath0 is determined by the spin temperature @xmath125 , coupled to the cmb temperature @xmath126 and the kinetic temperature of baryons @xmath11 through @xmath127 where @xmath128 }    { \\rm cm^{-2}\\ , s^{-1}\\ , hz^{-1}\\ , sr^{-1}})$ ] is the ly@xmath10 coupling coefficient with a correction factor of the order of unity @xmath129 and the local ly@xmath10 photon number intensity @xmath71 , and @xmath130 is the collisional coupling coefficient . here ,",
    "@xmath131 , @xmath132 is the spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath133 is the oscillator strength for the ly@xmath10 transition , and we use the tabulated values for @xmath134 by @xcite . in this work",
    "we adopt the form suitable for comoving gas without peculiar velocity , @xmath135\\left(1+{0.4}/{t_{{\\rm k}}}\\right)^{-1}$ ] , calculated by @xcite , where @xmath136 is the gas temperature in kelvin ; for similar results see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we accurately calculate @xmath0 considering both the finite optical depth and the peculiar velocity of gas elements ( appendix ) . in the highly nonlinear regime reached by e.g. rarepeak , some gas elements can be optically thick and also move at high peculiar velocities .",
    "large optical depth , where it occurs , invalidates the usual , optically thin approximation , and high peculiar velocities may lead to significant shifts of the signal in the observing frequency space .",
    "in addition , real - space cells may overlap in the observing frequency space due to the spatial variance of the peculiar velocity .",
    "therefore , we need a new scheme different from the typical optically thin approximation , which is described in appendix .    the results at @xmath16 = 17 , 15 and 13 on either the @xmath137 real - space grid or # ( sky pixels)@xmath19#(frequency bins)@xmath138 real - sky+frequency - space grid are illustrated in figures [ fig : densvel]-[fig:3kev ] . even though we accurately treat the finite optical depth and the effect of the peculiar velocity , it is still intuitive to analyze the result with the optically thin approximation , under which @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath112 is the ionized fraction of hydrogen .",
    "the overdensity of rarepeak ( figure [ fig : densvel ] ) is on average @xmath142 , and is maximized at @xmath143 in this resolution , which boosts @xmath0 of the most heated region to @xmath144\\sim[58 - 630]\\,{\\rm mk}$ ] .",
    "source location , density , temperature , and coupling parameter ( @xmath145 ) are rather strongly correlated with each other in the shock - heated or ionized region .",
    "thus , the dense inner region is in saturated emission ( @xmath2 ) regime such that @xmath146 and thus @xmath147^{0.5}\\left(1+\\delta_{{\\rm hi}}\\right)\\left(1-x\\right)$ ] .",
    "outside rarepeak , in contrast , @xmath148 before the igm is fully heated ( @xmath149 ) and thus it is in absorption ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the whole volume is seen in emission when ( 1 ) a large amount of x - ray photons escape rarepeak and ( 2 ) heat up gas efficiently , where the former occurs more easily with harder seds and the latter with softer seds , resulting in full emission at @xmath150 with photon energies in the range @xmath151\\,{\\rm kev}$ ] . when @xmath152 , x - ray photo - heating is most efficient , and thus the temperature inside rarepeak and other peaks are the highest , while efficient x - ray photon trapping by all these peaks regulate the build - up of the x - ray background in the igm outside the peaks .",
    "thus , a substantial portion of the igm remains colder than the cmb even at @xmath150 .",
    "because the x - ray photon opacity and heating rate drop rapidly at high frequency ( @xmath153 ) , the @xmath154 case has the smallest emission region , while the igm outside the shock - heated region is the coldest among all cases and resembles the case without x - ray sources most .",
    "the composite power - law sed case resembles the @xmath155 case at @xmath156 and 15 , while they show some difference at @xmath150 .    the high efficiency of x - ray radiation from our assumed pop - iii x - ray binaries in generating ly@xmath10 photons is clearly demonstrated in figures  [ fig : uvonly]-[fig:3kev ] .",
    "except for the case with @xmath154 ( figure  [ fig:3kev ] ) , the ly@xmath10 intensity ( or @xmath145 ) generated by secondary excitation due to x - ray photons ( figures  [ fig : synthetic]-[fig:1kev ] ) significantly exceeds the one generated by the uv continuum only ( figure  [ fig : uvonly ] ) .",
    "this also indicates that x - ray binaries are efficient sources of heating , as shown in figures  [ fig : uvonly]-[fig:1kev ] , as long as most ",
    "@xmath157 in our simulation  pop - iii stars leave behind x - ray binaries , but again with the exception of the case with @xmath154 ( figure  [ fig:3kev ] ) . when @xmath154 , the relatively small optical depth makes the x - ray photons travel almost freely without too much interaction with gas elements .    how emission transitions to absorption is also noteworthy , because it shows a `` ly@xmath10 sphere '' .",
    "when @xmath154 , or there is no x - ray flux present , the emission region ( heated by adiabatic compression of the igm ) is surrounded by the maximum - absorption trough , weakening towards larger radii ( figures [ fig : uvonly ] and [ fig:3kev ] ) .",
    "this is due to the rapid decline of @xmath145 ( @xmath71 ) with increasing radius , which couples @xmath125 most strongly to the @xmath11 ( @xmath158 ) of the relatively unheated igm in the vicinity of clustered sources but progressively weakly outward .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath159 , in the cases of @xmath160\\,{\\rm kev}$ ] and the composite power - law seds , @xmath0 decreases monotonically with increasing radius . in these cases ,",
    "x - ray heating becomes very efficient and the igm around the sources is heated significantly above @xmath126 , so there is no chance to form the deep absorption trough at @xmath159 .",
    "nevertheless , there still exist cases with an absorption trough with x - rays present , which occur at @xmath161 when the sed is a power law ( at @xmath162 ) or @xmath163 ( at @xmath164 $ ] ) .",
    "this is due to the efficient x - ray photon trapping at low frequency and the slower build - up of an x - ray background than in the harder x - ray cases .        the strong emission , @xmath165\\,{\\rm mk}$ ] , and",
    "the absence of the absorption trough ( except for the inefficient heating case ) in some of the models may seem to contradict previous predictions on the 21-cm signal from individual qsos or first star - black hole systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the former is simply due to the fact that rarepeak has a large overdensity , while previous work assumed a mean density for the igm ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that very efficient creation of x - ray binaries makes the ratio of x - ray to uv photons larger than that used in previous work .",
    "rarepeak has @xmath167\\,{\\rm erg\\ , s^{-1}\\ , sfr(m_{\\odot}/yr)}$ ] ( xawno ; sfr = star formation rate ) when both pop iii and ii stars are considered , while much smaller values , @xmath168 , have been used previously to model starburst galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this can be cast into another familiar parameter @xmath169 , defined in @xcite as @xmath170 or sometimes more concisely as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the total x - ray energy emitted per stellar baryon(@xcite ) . with the former definition",
    ", we find that @xmath173 at @xmath27 for efficient x - ray binary cases while x - rays from starburst galaxies have @xmath174 at most .",

    "we therefore investigate this possibility by calculating the power spectrum due to these rare peaks .",
    "this is to quantify the contribution to the power spectrum from these _ rare peaks only _ , and checking for any possibility to sort these high - density peaks out of other contributors such as the fluctuation of the cosmological matter - density field and the fluctuation in the distribution of all the astrophysical sources . in reality",

    "therefore , if the resulting power spectrum is comparable to the cosmological one , we may safely assume that the power spectrum analysis is not adequate for probing these rare objects .",
    "note that this is a rough estimate of the detectability , and thus in this paper we simply take the real - space 3d power spectrum in the comoving coordinates as the approximate 3d power spectrum in the observing frame , where one should in principle take into account the impact of the peculiar velocities ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; msmika ) and the light - cone effect ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in a gaussian density field filtered on scale @xmath238 , the number density of peaks with @xmath239 ( @xmath240 : rms of filtered density ) is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath241 where @xmath84 is the power - law spectral index of matter - density power spectrum @xmath242 . at @xmath27 , around relevant wavenumber @xmath243 , @xmath244 .",

    "@xmath268 is the usual 1-halo term , which reflects both the rarity of peaks ( @xmath259 ) and the characteristics of the radial profile .",
    "when these peaks are spatially correlated , the 2-halo term @xmath269 arises with the bias parameter @xmath270 , and thus @xmath271 .",

    "the variance at given @xmath276 , @xmath277 , is a useful indicator of the degree of fluctuation at the corresponding scale .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : power - spectrum ] , @xmath278 of rare peaks never reaches @xmath279 regardless of the x - ray model , which makes the statistical observation of these peaks very difficult .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum is given by ( 1 ) the white spectrum at @xmath280 because peaks are not resolved and are therefore equivalent to randomly distributed point sources on these large scales , and ( 2 ) the spectrum roughly decaying faster than @xmath281 at @xmath282 due to the relatively smooth spatial variation of @xmath256 .",
    "the peak is at @xmath283 , and if we roughly extrapolate the noise estimates at @xmath284 and @xmath285 with @xmath286 of @xcite to @xmath287 , hera and ska will have @xmath288 and @xmath289 , respectively .",
    "therefore , hera and ska may seem to have opportunity to observe these rare peaks through the power spectrum analysis .",
    "however , as noted earlier in this section , the net contribution from all the astrophysical sources dominates the power spectrum and is much larger than the power spectrum of the cosmological origin .",
    "therefore , we need to address whether the power spectrum only by these rare peaks is comparable to the cosmological one .",
    "we compare the nonlinear @xmath251 from rare peaks to the cosmological @xmath251 , or @xmath290 where for consistency we use the igm value @xmath291 which varies over different x - ray models , and assume zero ionization , uniform background , uniform @xmath125 and take baryons as a perfect tracer of dark matter  as shown by @xcite , and this can change the amplitude and the shape of @xmath292 significantly from the form given by equation ( [ eq : pk - cosmological ] ) if this effect results in efficient thermalization of the igm ( @xcite ) .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : power - spectrum ] , in most cases the power spectrum is dominated by @xmath292 .",

    "note that the peculiar shape of the power spectrum by rare peaks ( only ) is the result of considering only those sparsely spaced but individually extended signals , just as seen in similar shape found by @xcite when only isolated qso signals are considered .",
    "in contrast , a very different shape is usually predicted for the power spectrum when all astrophysical sources are considered , which will be distributed diffusely when they are strongly correlated with the underlying matter - density distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .    based on the fact that the power spectrum from all the astrophysical sources dominates the power spectrum over that of the cosmological origin , and the power spectrum of rare peaks are just comparable to the cosmological one , we conclude that probing these rare peaks through power spectrum analysis is not as encouraging as tomography . nevertheless , it is worthwhile to investigate how the detailed microphysical process including various feedback effects may affect the net power spectrum .",
    "previous studies usually consider simplified source models with an averaged or a constant mass - to - light ratio , which makes the distribution of astrophysical sources very strongly correlated with the underlying density field ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if e.g. radiative feedback effects affect star formation inside nearby halos , such a strong correlation may break down and the power spectrum will be affected .",
    "estimating this self - consistently requires extending the degree of accuracy of our rarepeak calculation to a much larger scale , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we delay this investigation into the future ( xu et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of observing strongly clustered stars at high redshifts ( @xmath300 ) by future and current radio interferometers through 21-cm tomography and power spectrum analysis .",
    "we have assumed that x - ray emission is from x - ray binaries after binary pop iii stellar systems evolve , with high success rate of 50% for such events ( we let 50% of pop iii star particles in the simulation end up as x - ray binaries , and emit x - rays constantly for 10 myrs through the accretion of matter by black holes at the eddington limit ) . by properly calculating the local feedback and the global background ,",
    "these x - ray sources are found to be not efficient in ionizing the igm at @xmath301 , but very efficient in heating the igm above cmb temperature and also generating ly@xmath10 photons when the rest - frame x - ray photon energy is @xmath302 .",
    "there exist somewhat isolated rare density peaks , which then generate spatially extended ( @xmath303 comoving mpc ) , quasi - spherical @xmath0 profiles .",
    "the peak center is in emission , and depending on the x - ray sed and its amplitude , there may or may not exist an absorption trough .",
    "low - energy x - rays are found to be very efficient in heating the igm before ly@xmath10 pumping becomes important ( @xmath304 ) , for this high success rate of x - ray binary formation by pop iii stars , erasing the absorption trough feature .",
    "when the rest - frame x - ray energy is @xmath305 , there exists an era when ly@xmath10 pumping is efficient while the x - ray heating region is somewhat confined within the ly@xmath10 sphere in the cold igm , leaving the absorption trough still visible .",
    "real space imaging ( tomography ) seems more promising than the power spectrum analysis , and ska with @xmath306 core and reasonable ( ~1000 hr ) integration times can obtain excellent s / n ratios for most of our models in this high redshift range , provided that the image plane is filtered with a beam of @xmath307 and bandwidth of @xmath308 .",
    "the power spectrum due to many rare peaks such as the ones treated here is smaller than that from linear fluctuations in most cases , and thus the 21-cm power spectrum analysis is not likely to probe these rare peaks out of the full 21-cm power spectrum caused both by the cosmological density fluctuation and that by all existing astrophysical sources .",
    "we note that the absorption trough feature will be a smoking gun for high - redshift uv sources .",
    "the depth of the absorption will strongly depend on the efficiency of igm heating .",
    "if the x - ray heating era is more delayed because formation of the x - ray binary systems is not as efficient as we assumed or rest - frame x - ray photons are predominantly at low energies ( @xmath309 ) such that they are mostly trapped by the surrounding igm , even deeper ( a few to several hundred mk when unfiltered ) absorption will be observed .",
    "nevertheless , as the universe evolves , more and more density peaks and filaments will appear around rarepeak , which may erase this isolated , quasi - spherical feature by forming their own radiation profiles and overlapping with one another ( as seen in fig [ fig:300ev ] ) .",
    "we will investigate this possibility in the future .",
    "if an object like rarepeak is imaged in the sky , it should reveal the degree of x - ray heating from the system .",
    "if no absorption trough is observed , it will imply that at least locally the igm has been heated beyond the cmb temperature ( or simply the trough is unresolved ) .",
    "in contrast , when an absorption trough is observed , it will imply that either ly@xmath10 pumping efficiency ( and hence the uv luminosity ) is much greater than the x - ray heating efficiency ( x - ray luminosity ) or the system is in the early stage of x - ray heating such that the heated region has not grown comparable in size to the ly@xmath10 sphere . in either case",
    ", we should be able to constrain the uv / x - ray luminosity ratio of these early sources .",
    "depending on the aggregated uv / x - ray luminosity ratio from the full spectrum of sources , it may be possible that the x - ray heating era can precede the ly@xmath10 pumping era , while we do not observe this in any of our models .",
    "there seems to be tension between 21-cm astrophysics and cosmology even at high redshifts ( @xmath310 ) . while it is difficult to extrapolate our result directly , there",
    "exist several astrophysical effects that require careful attention for high - redshift 21-cm cosmology .",
    "first , it may be possible that many well isolated peaks produce nonlinear fluctuations in the ly@xmath10 and the x - ray background , as it seems already possible at a specific @xmath276 range with an admittedly contrived x - ray model ( 300 ev case at @xmath150 , fig [ fig : power - spectrum ] ) .",
    "if we imagine a full spectrum of those peaks ( of different mass for example ) , it is possible that the ly@xmath10 pumping field has nonlinear fluctuations around the mean at @xmath311 .",
    "many models already find that this is indeed the case , where astrophysical information dominates the fluctuating signal over the cosmological information even during the cd .",
    "second , the uv emissivity of minihalos inside our simulation is relatively small mainly due to the effective minimum mass of minihalos hosting stars is large , which is @xmath40",
    ". the uv feedback may be much more advanced than what has been simulated here , as is inferred by e.g. @xcite where the mean ionization fraction at @xmath27 can be as high as @xmath312 if efficient formation of pop iii stars in minihalos of @xmath313 is assumed , even with lyman - werner feedback on the primordial cooling agent @xmath314 . the 21-cm signal",
    "will then be again dominated by the astrophysical information , whose observation would be more useful in astrophysics , such as discriminating between these two models with very different efficiencies in pop - iii star formation . thus for 21-cm cosmology",
    ", it is preferred that the observation is done at the highest possible redshift to enable at least the @xmath315-decomposition of the observed power spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ; msmika ) when every field relevant for building up the 21-cm @xmath251 is in the linear regime .",
    "the baryon - dark matter offset velocity ( @xcite ) is in some sense another nuisance to cosmology even at very high redshift , because the rate and spatial fluctuations of the induced shock heating are not yet well understood , even though the power spectrum can be strongly boosted for much easier observation than what had been predicted before ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thank andrei mesinger and xuelei chen for helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported by a research grant from chosun university ( 2009 ) .",
    "in general , the nonlinear evolution of density and temperature will generate non - negligible opacity to the 21-cm radiation from place to place .",
    "in addition , the peculiar velocity of gas elements shifts the observing frequency and can make photons go through the 21-cm transition multiple times along the los while ending up with the same observing frequency .",
    "therefore , even though the line optical depth is defined locally as an integrated quantity of a dirac delta function under cosmological scale , we need to carefully treat the multi - valuedness of line transitions as follows .",
    "it becomes the most convenient when one considers uniformly discretized redshift space , and map the real - space mesh into the redshift - space mesh , which was dubbed as mesh - to - mesh ( mm ) real - to - redshift - space - mapping ( rrm ) scheme in msmika .",
    "while msmika show explicitly how mm - rrm under frequency overlap can be done in the optically thin limit , it was not shown explicitly how to perform mm - rrm in the generic case with finite optical depth and frequency overlap . here",
    "we describe the detailed scheme for the mm - rrm and the radiative transfer in the most generic cases .",
    "the most generic form of the transfer equation ( equation 18 of msmika ) is @xmath316 which can also be expressed in terms of brightness temperatures : @xmath317 when equations ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) of msmika are used . here",
    "@xmath318 is the cosmological redshift of a gas element , which is shifted in the redshift space ( or the observing frequency space ) due to the los peculiar velocity @xmath319 , with @xmath320 .",
    "the variance in @xmath319 thus can make different gas elements along the los to be observed at the same @xmath321 ( frequency overlap ) .",
    "due to thermal broadening , this overlap may be extended a little bit across more gas elements , but we find that the peculiar velocity is the dominant cause of the frequency overlap , and thus ignore thermal broadening .",
    "as shown in msmika , correction to the optical depth due to thermal broadening at about the highest temperature reached , @xmath322 , is only of order @xmath323 .",
    "we can write equation  ( [ eq : generict ] ) more explicitly .",
    "if there are n locations along the los yielding the same @xmath321 , equation  ( [ eq : generict ] ) becomes @xmath324 where indicies @xmath116 and @xmath325 increase toward the near side of the simulation box to the observer , a gas element at @xmath326 has the optical depth @xmath327 and the total optical depth of all the gas elements with the same @xmath321 is @xmath328 .",
    "a gas element at @xmath326 emits radiation in proportion to ( @xmath329 , and is attenuated by the accumulated optical depth @xmath330 by those `` in front of '' the element and the element itself .",
    "the differential brightness temperature at @xmath321 then becomes @xmath331 which obviously converges to the usual form ( e.g. equation 47 of msmika ) for the case without frequency overlap , when @xmath332 .    for mm - rrm",
    ", we first form an empty data cube corresponding to the simulation box at the redshift of interest but with the los observing frequency as the los axis . without peculiar velocities ,",
    "then , there will be a one - to - one mapping of the real - space cube onto the observing - space cube .",
    "in general , however , we need to shift each cell according to the peculiar velocity .",
    "we shift each los boundary between two adjacent real - space cells in the redshift space by the average of the two cell - centered peculiar velocities in addition to the cosmological redshift .",
    "this guarantees that these cells do not overlap in frequency unless a frequency - crossing of two boundaries occurs .",
    "the same frequency shifting scheme is used in e.g. @xcite and msmika .",

    "<S> the boost of the signal by the high - density environment ( @xmath4 ) and on a relatively large scale combine to make rarepeak a discernible , spatially - extended ( @xmath5 ) object for 21 cm observation at @xmath6 , which is found to be detectable as a single object by ska with integration time of @xmath7 hours . </S>",
    "<S> power spectrum analysis by some of the ska precursors ( lofar , mwa , paper ) of such rare peaks is found difficult due to the rarity of these peaks , and the contribution only by these rare peaks to the total power spectrum remains subdominant compared to that by all astrophysical sources . </S>"
