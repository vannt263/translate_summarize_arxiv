    "the study of the hidden charm sector has been a very active field lately with many studies involving interactions of meson - baryon or meson - meson  @xcite .",
    "in particular the @xmath6 resonance is predicted in many models including the meson - baryon interaction  @xcite or heavy quark spin symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the role of those states in the production of charmed hadrons is a new field that requires an exhaustive study because new facilities will have enough energy to generate those particles .",
    "one example is the pion beam experiments at j - parc where the energy of the pion is expected to be over 20 gev  @xcite , and therefore , it is sufficient to produce those hidden charmed baryons at j - parc . in the near future",
    "the j - parc in japan will be one of the efficient facilities in which to study the predicted baryon states dynamically generated from the meson - baryon interaction with hidden charm .",

    "@xcite , studied the photo - production of this @xmath6 resonance and they found that it is difficult to search for the @xmath6 resonance in photo - production because of the very large background .    it has been found in previous works  @xcite that states below the threshold of a process can generate bumps close to the threshold , leading to claims of resonance above the threshold of the reaction studied ; hence , we expect that if the @xmath6 state is created in the @xmath18 scattering , a strong signal in the @xmath19 production should be visible close to the reaction threshold .    in this work",
