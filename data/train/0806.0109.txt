    "the general principles in non - living systems play significant roles in living systems .",
    "how do the principles in gravity theory or in quantum mechanism impact on our understanding of life ?",
    "an organism can not keep active without the supply of energy due to the first law in thermodynamics . and it can not live long without the supply of minus entropy due to the second law in thermodynamics .",
    "but it seems that there are no direct effects of the relativity principle or the uncertainty principle on life .",
    "we found that the holographic principle , which is likely only one of several independent conceptual advances needed for progress in quantum gravity @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , profoundly constraints the forms of life and substantially impacts on the evolution of life .",
    "the holographic principle states that there is a precise , general and surprisingly strong limit on the information content of spacetime regions .",
    "the number of quantum states in a spatial region is bounded from above by the surface of the region measured in the unit of four - fold planck areas .",
    "this entropy bound is a strong constraint on any theory about our universe .",
    "if this principle is true , field theory or string theory , where there are infinite degrees of freedom , can not be the ultimate theory . and if this principle can be applied to the phenomenon of life , the degrees of freedom in a living system will also be constrained . from this point of view",
    ", the principles in relativity or in quantum theory constrain life in an alternative way .",
    "the holographic principle indicates that there is a strict relationship between the information storage capacity of the space and the complexity of any organism wherein .",
    "such a basic idea can be illustrated by a simple example .",
    "whatever a living system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom is , we can conclude that it can never exist in a universe with a horizon area less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the planck length .    in this paper , we estimated the immense degrees of freedom for living systems according to the theory of gene regulatory networks and boolean networks @xcite @xcite .",
    "we found a contradiction between the possible degrees of freedom of living systems and the maximum information storage capacity in the observed universe .",
    "then we reconciled this contradiction in terms of the causality between the possible sequences of macromolecules for the actual living systems , which is equivalent to the existence of language of genes .",
    "we propose evidences of language of genes and we can explain the outline of protein length distributions by a linguistic mechanism of generation of protein sequences .",
    "we can also explain the leaps in the evolution of biological complexity according to the entropy bound .",
    "information properly bridges biology and physics @xcite@xcite@xcite , which gives deep insights into the nature of life . with the development of genetics , we know that the gene regulatory networks play significant roles in development and evolution of life @xcite . based on the theory of self - organization ,",
    "kauffman proposed a general theory of boolean networks to describe the gene regulatory networks , where the interactions between genes can represented by boolean operations between the nodes of the network @xcite .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom of a living system can be estimated by the number of states of the corresponding boolean network .",
    "proteins are the elementary units in the activities of life .",
    "so a living organism can be represented by a dynamical system of all the proteins in its body .",
    "we denote the set @xmath3 as all possible protein sequences with a cutoff of protein length @xmath4 .",
    "proteins are chains concatenated by @xmath5 amino acids .",
    "so there are @xmath6 elements in the set @xmath3 .",
    "we define a boolean network @xmath7 as the boolean network whose nodes are elements of @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "according to the definition of boolean networks , there are two states for each node of a boolean network : `` on '' or `` off '' @xcite .",
    "a state of @xmath8 represent that some nodes are `` on '' while the others are `` off '' .",
    "so a proteome can be represented by a state of @xmath8 , where only the nodes corresponding to protein sequences in the proteome are `` on '' .",
    "the state space @xmath9 consists of all possible states of @xmath7 whose number is @xmath10 an actual species can be represented by a point in @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of a species can be illustrated by a trajectory in @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "2b ) . as a preliminary consideration ,",
    "the degrees of freedom of a living system can be estimated by the logarithm of number of states @xmath11 which we will reconsider later on .    according to the holographic principle",
    ", we can calculate that the information in the observed universe is about @xcite @xmath12 this value is too large for non - living systems .",
    "for example , the information of black body cosmic background photons is about @xmath13 bits , which may be the largest degrees of freedom for possible non - living systems .",
    "but it is still much less than @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining information storage capacity in our universe has not been wasted however for there being living systems .",
    "the degrees of freedom for living systems are so immense that may exceed the maximum information storage capacity in the observed universe .",
    "the structure of chains of genetic macromolecules essentially provides immense degrees of freedom for living systems , because the number of possible protein sequences can be as large as @xmath15 . for a living system",
    ", the degrees of freedom may be equivalent to that of the observed universe if the protein length is about @xmath16 amino acids .",
    "interestingly , the most frequent protein length for the life on our planet is about @xmath17 .",
    "the immense degrees of freedom of living systems originate from the great number of possible sequences in @xmath7 .",
    "most of the degrees of freedom come from the states of @xmath7 in which about half the nodes are `` on '' . on the other hand , the degrees of freedom can also come from the states in which only a minority of nodes are `` on '' .",
    "our living systems belong to the latter case , where there are only thousands of proteins in actual proteomes .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the estimate of immense degrees of freedom of a living system in the above , however , seriously contradicts the holographic principle if we consider the actual life around us .",
    "the average protein length in a proteome ranges about from @xmath18 amino acids to @xmath19 amino acids , and a certain number of proteins are longer than thousands of amino acids . according to the preliminary estimate",
    ", the degrees of freedoms for the actual living systems on our planet will be much larger than the maximum degrees of freedoms in the observed universe @xmath14 .",
    "we have to reconcile the contradiction between the preliminary estimate of degrees of freedom of living systems and the conclusion of the holographic principle .",
    "if the holographic principle is not invalid , we must find ways to shrink the preliminary estimate of the degrees of freedom of living systems .",
    "we introduce the causality between the states of @xmath7 to reveal the additional constraint on the degrees of freedom by the entropy bound . at the beginning of the evolution on the planet",
    ", the first living system may be denoted as an inertial state @xmath20 .",
    "when the degrees of freedom of @xmath7 is greater than @xmath14 , not all the states of @xmath7 can have causal relationship with @xmath20 unless the holographic principle is untrue .",
    "we define the set @xmath21 as all the states that have causal relationship with @xmath20 , which has @xmath22 states and is only a proper subset of @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "the nodes of @xmath21 constitute @xmath23 , which is a subset of @xmath3 .",
    "an actual living system at present corresponds to a dynamic system evolving only in the state space @xmath21 and a meaningful protein sequence in biology must belong to @xmath23 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of a living system , therefore , can be defined by the number of states in @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath22 is much less than @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be rightly less than @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the causality provides a physical explanation to distinguish a part of sequences @xmath23 from all possible sequences @xmath28 .",
    "not all the amino acid chains or base chains are meaningful in biology . according to the theory of formal language ,",
    "a language is defined by a subset of all the sequences concatenated by letters in a given alphabet @xcite .",
    "the choice of a subset @xmath23 from @xmath3 is a natural way to define a formal language ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the protein or dna languages originate in the constraint on the degrees of freedom of life by the entropy bound .",
    "the alphabet of protein language consists of @xmath5 amino acids , and the alphabet of the language of genes consists of @xmath29 bases .",
    "the arrangement of the letters in the sequences should be determined by some grammars . although there are various entropy bounds , there is no difference for the requirement of finite degrees of freedom in life and the requirement of the language of genes for all the theories .",
    "to some extent , the language of genes is a consequence of the principles in quantum gravity .",
    "the phenomenon of life is constrained strictly by the entropy bound .",
    "the requirement of the order of sequences by the grammars can not be explained in the context of classical physics because the degrees of freedom of life can be infinite .",
    "the ability of speaking for human beings is determined by genes . that we can communicate with each other instinctively",
    "can be attributed to our common genes .",
    "the human language can be viewed as a transformation of cell language @xcite .",
    "the information storage capacity of a natural language can also be estimated by the similar calculation in the above .",
    "for instance , we estimated that there are up to @xmath30 bits of information can be written in a language with @xmath31 letters and the length of words in the language is @xmath32 , which is much less than the protein length . in this sense , the natural language is simpler than the language of genes .",
    "the value @xmath33 is much less than the information in the observed universe @xmath14 .",
    "so the description of the universe by natural language is always a simplified version of the actually complex world .",
    "interestingly , there were not rare cases to reach the same goal by different routes in the history of natural sciences , such as , riemannian geometry and general relativity , or the theory of bundles and gauge theories .",
    "such encounters may come from that all the descriptions in different subjects have a common ultimate theory of all the information in the universe , although we can not understand all the details of the world by only one subject .",
    "[ fig3 ]    several attempts have been made over the past three decades to combine linguistic theory with biology @xcite @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the number of occurrences of protein domains in a genome can be a good fit of the power - law distribution known as zipf s law in linguistics , and we can distinguish between the protein linguistics and the language of genes according to the theory of formal language @xcite .",
    "so the experimental observations support the existence of languages in the sequences of macromolecules . on one hand ,",
    "they are required by the holographic principle . on the other hand , they are consequences of the evolution of life at the molecular level @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the alphabets of amino acids or bases formed at the beginning of life . and genetic code developed and fixed in the early stage of evolution .",
    "all these factors can determine whether a sequence is permitted in a life , which is equivalent to the role of grammars at the molecular level .",
    "we found a strong evidence of the underlying mechanism in the organization of amino acids in protein sequences by studying the correlations between protein length distributions , which indicates the languages in the protein sequences .",
    "the protein length distribution corresponds to a vector @xmath34 where there are @xmath35 proteins with length @xmath36 in the complete proteome of a species and @xmath37 is the cutoff of protein length .",
    "our data of the protein length distributions are obtained from the data of @xmath38 complete proteomes in the database predictions for entire proteomes @xcite .",
    "the discrete fourier transformation of the protein length distribution is : @xmath39 let @xmath40 denotes the frequency of the highest peak @xmath41 in the discrete fourier transformation of the protein length distribution for a species .",
    "we found that there is an interesting relationship between the frequency @xmath40 and the average protein length @xmath42 of species .",
    "the distribution of species in @xmath43 plane shows an regular pattern : the species in the three domains ( archaebacteria , eubacteria and eukaryotes ) gathered in three rainbow - like arches respectively ( fig 3 ) .",
    "this pattern strongly indicates the intrinsic correlation among the protein length distributions , which can never achieve if the protein length distributions are stochastic .",
    "the periodic - like fluctuations in the protein length distribution @xcite may also originate in the underlying mechanism of generation of protein sequences .",
    "we propose a model to reveal the underlying mechanism in the protein sequences according to tree adjoining grammar @xcite . in the model ,",
    "protein sequences can be generated by tree adjoining operations , i.e. , substituting the initial tree or auxiliary trees into to each other by identifying the inner nodes ( fig .",
    "4a ) @xcite .",
    "there is only one variant @xmath44 in the model , which is the probability of substitutions in the adjoining operations and denotes different species .",
    "a certain number of proteins can be generated when @xmath44 is fixed , hence we obtain a protein length distribution by the model ( fig .",
    "the properties of protein length distributions can be explained by the simulation . the outline and the fluctuations of the simulated protein length distribution agree with the actual protein length distributions in principle .",
    "we show that there is a close relationship between the protein length distributions and grammar rules .",
    "the fluctuations in the distributions are determined by the grammar rules .",
    "the same grammar rule corresponds to the same distribution . if changing grammar rules , we obtain different outlines and fluctuations of distribution .",
    "this result suggests that the fluctuations in actual protein length distributions are intrinsic properties of certain species and may infer the underlying mechanism on the order of protein sequences .",
    "the evolution of complexity of life is not a linear course of increment @xcite@xcite .",
    "the entropy bound can also explain the leaps in the evolution of biological complexity .",
    "consequently we can outline the macroevolution of life .",
    "the gene regulatory networks are accelerating networks @xcite@xcite . according to this theory",
    ", the evolution of complexity of any accelerating networks has to be slowed down and will stop at an upper limit of complexity . hence there must be upper limits of complexity in both of the evolution of biological complexity for prokaryotes and eukaryotes , where the entropy bound is a natural upper limit .",
    "the whole evolution of biological complexity can be , therefore , divided into three steps : the evolution of unicellular life , the evolution of multicellular life and the evolution of society of human beings .",
    "the cambrian explosion divided the first two steps .",
    "and we found that the evolution of multicellular life has reached its upper limit because the maximum non - coding dna content is near to @xmath45 at present .",
    "the civilization of human beings appeared , which can be taken as an alternative form of biological complexity .",
    "the entire evolution of biological complexity should be governed by a universal mechanism of evolution . the universal language of genes in species may harmonize the evolution of life in the biosphere .",
    "croft , l. j. , lercher , m. j. , gagen , m. j. & mattick , j. s. is prokaryotic complexity limited by accelerated growth in regulatory overhead .",
