    "while the local e1 strength at low energies weakly correlates with isovector indicators such as symmetry energy , the magnitude of those correlations varies rapidly around the lower end of the gdr region .",
    "this strong dependence on the cutoff energy indicates that a pygmy strength can not be unambiguously defined ; hence , it is not a particularly useful quantity .",
    "of particular importance are the fully integrated strength ; the much celebrated sum rules .",
    "the @xmath6 sum rules , such as the dipole polarizability @xmath10 ( the inverse energy weighted sum rule ) , the sum rule enhancement factor @xmath16 ( strongly correlated with the energy weighted sum rule ) , and the total accumulated e1 strength are all excellent probes of nuclear isovector properties . at the isoscalar side",
    ", we found a relatively strong correlation between nuclear incompressibility and the accumulated isoscalar dipole strength for @xmath65@xmath5 ( at @xmath109mev and above 20mev ) . in general , experimental studies at @xmath110 in the isovector and isoscalar channel could provide an excellent window for a better characterization of e1 strength and relating it to fundamental nuclear properties .",

    "<S> background : :    recent experiments on the electric dipole ( e1 ) polarizability in heavy    nuclei have stimulated theoretical interest in the low - energy electric    dipole strength , both isovector and isoscalar . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    we study the information content carried by the electric dipole    strength with respect to isovector and isoscalar indicators    characterizing bulk nuclear matter and finite nuclei . to separate    isoscalar and isovector modes , and low - energy strength and giant    resonances </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the e1 strength as a function of excitation    energy @xmath0 and momentum transfer @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> methods : :    we use the self - consistent nuclear density functional theory with    skyrme energy density functionals , augmented by the random phase    approximation , to compute the e1 strength , and covariance analysis to    assess correlations between observables </S>",
    "<S> . calculations are performed    for spherical , doubly - magic nuclei @xmath2pb and    @xmath3sn . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    we demonstrate that e1 transition densities in the low - energy region    below the giant dipole resonance exhibit appreciable state dependence    and multi - nodal structures , which are fingerprints of weak    collectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between the accumulated low - energy    strength and symmetry energy is weak , and dramatically depends on the    energy cutoff assumed . on the other hand , a strong correlation is    predicted between isovector indicators and the accumulated isovector    strength at @xmath0 around 20mev and momentum transfer    @xmath4@xmath5 . conclusions : :    momentum- and coordinate - space pattern of the low - energy dipole modes    indicate a strong fragmentation into individual particle - hole    excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the global measure of low - energy dipole strength poorly    correlates with the nuclear symmetry energy and other isovector    characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our results do not support the    suggestion that there exists a collective  pygmy dipole resonance , \"    which is a strong indicator of nuclear isovector properties . by    considering nonzero values of momentum transfer </S>",
    "<S> , one can isolate    individual excitations and nicely separate low - energy excitations from    the @xmath6 and @xmath7 giant collective modes .    </S>",
    "<S> that is , measurements at @xmath8 may serve as a tool to    correlate the e1 strength with certain bulk observables , such as    incompressibility or symmetry energy . </S>"
