    "after the new era of atomic physics opened by the successful realization of ultracold atoms , the focus now turns to the ultracold molecule that would lead to the test of fundamental physics , the realization of quantum control chemical reaction and cold chemistry @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "the efficient formation of a high density ultracold molecular ensemble and the detection of ultracold molecule are the major issues .",
    "the formation of molecule in the ultracold regime ( @xmath3 ) has been demonstrated using the optical or the magnetic association of ultracold atoms .",
    "for the magnetic association ( feshbach resonance ) @xcite , the atomic ensemble is required to be in a degenerate or near - degenerate quantum state and the feshbach molecules are formed in a loosely bound triplet state . by contrast , the optical association ( photoassociation , pa ) @xcite can be performed directly in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and produce more deeply bound molecules , but less efficient .",
    "one of the approaches to enhance the production rate of photoassociated diatomic cold molecules in the singlet ground state @xmath0 is to take advantage of the resonant coupling effect , which couples vibrational levels of the @xmath4 states converging to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 asymptotes due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "such an enhancement was first demonstrated using atomic caesium by c. dion _ et .",
    "@xcite , then for rubidium @xmath7 by h. k. pechkis _ et .",
    "_ @xcite . by adopting this effect , using just single - photon association ,",
    "it becomes feasible to generate a large amount of the ground state molecules well below the dissociation limit .",
    "however , a high number density of ultracold molecule using single - photon association has not yet been demonstrated . because the experiments mentioned above were performed in mots , the produced molecule dropped off the mots and can not be accumulated . in this experiment ,",
    "a large number of ultracold rubidium dimer @xmath1 was produced and accumulated in a crossed optical dipole trap ( odt ) to reach a high number density .",
    "the detection of ultracold molecule is the crucial technique for the ultracold molecular experiments . in comparison with detecting ultracold atoms using the conventional absorption image technique ,",
    "the challenges lying in the ultracold molecules are : the small amount , the low number density and the complex internal structure of the produced molecules . in producing ultracold molecule from associating atoms ,",
    "various methods have been proposed and demonstrated to detect the molecular association resonance , such as trap loss of the mot @xcite , the optical @xcite or the magnetic @xcite traps .",
    "the optical and magnetic association resonance enhance the atom - atom collision , which induce atomic losses in a trap , or a macroscopic mechanic oscillation effect upon the cold atomic cloud @xcite .",
    "all of these methods are to detect the `` excitation process '' of the ground state atoms to the excited ground molecular state .",
    "they have shown versatility in characterizing and searching for the association resonance , rather than the final produced ground state ultracold molecules .",
    "the capability of detecting the final production , the ground state molecule , is highly demanded to allow optimizing the efficiency of the producing and loading ultracold molecule .",
    "two methods of detecting the ground state ultracold molecule have been demonstrated : resonance - enhanced multi - photon ionization ( rempi ) and the direct absorption image . in experiments where ultracold molecules are produced using an incoherent process , such as single - photon pa ,",
    "the highly - sensitive multi - photon ionization has been widely applied @xcite , since the high resolution to assign molecular states and the state - selectivity .",
    "recently , the direct molecular absorption image scheme has been realized for imaging the ground state molecules by d. wang _ et .",
    "however , in comparison with the conventional ultracold atom detection ( absorption image ) , both methods of ultracold molecule detection are more complex and delicate . a robust , convenient and less invasive detection mechanism",
    "is still required for ultracold molecule experiments .    in our experiment , a novel ultracold molecular detection mechanism is demonstrated utilizing the ultracold atoms mixed with the molecules as a detector .",
    "the detector ( ultracold atoms ) is affected by the atom - molecule collisions due to the existence of the molecules .",
    "the produced ultracold molecules can then be characterized using the typical absorption image of the  detector \"  atoms .",
    "most of the previous atom - molecule collision experiments @xcite were performed in the limit of low molecule number ( @xmath8 ) , and the atom - molecule collision was observed through the collision loss of molecule , rather than the loss of the mixed atoms . the high molecular number density , achieved in this experiment , allowed us to compare the absorption images of the atoms with and without the mixed molecules , and to observe a pronouncing trap loss and heating of the atoms caused by the inelastic atom - molecule collision .",
    "the experimental results have been used to derive the atom - molecule collision rate @xmath9 and to measure the number of the produced molecules @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11rb atoms for forming @xmath1 were trapped from the background thermal atoms , and cooled by a mot in a stainless vacuum chamber with a vapor pressure of @xmath12 10@xmath13 torr using a rubidium dispenser as an atomic source .",
    "the shape of the atomic cloud loaded in the mot was approximately spherical with a 1.4 mm diameter and @xmath1210@xmath14 @xmath11rb atoms at @xmath15f=3@xmath16 state were collected to reach a peak number density of @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the temperature of @xmath11rb was measured to be 120  @xmath20 using the time - of - flight free expansion images .",
    "a single frequency cw ti : sapphire laser ( 795 nm , 300 mw ) pumped by a 5.25 w diode - pumped solid - state green laser was used for the pa process .",
    "the pa laser was frequency - stabilized using a temperature - stabilized optical cavity and with a beam size matched to the atomic cloud for a higher molecular formation efficiency .",
    "the @xmath21 crossed optical dipole trap was based on a 20  w fiber laser ( 1080 nm , manlight , ml20-cw - r - oem ) , whose output beam was split into two parts with a power ratio of 50:50 .",
    "each beam was focused into the center of the mot cloud with beam waists of 47  @xmath22 and 44  @xmath22 , corresponding to intensities of 118  @xmath23 and 125  @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "fig.@xmath39 shows the time sequence of the experiment .",
    "all the mot , pa laser beams and odt were turned on during the 10  sec collecting stages .",
    "subsequently , in order to load atoms into the odt efficiently , we applied a polarization gradient cooling ( pgc ) for 30  ms to cool the atoms from 120  @xmath20 down to 30  @xmath20 . to avoid the loss owing to the hyperfine - changing collisions ,",
    "the atoms were prepared in the f=2 ground state by illuminating a light on the @xmath40 resonance for a short period to optical - pump . once both of atoms and molecules were loaded and prepared , all the laser beams and",
    "the mot quadruple magnetic field were off , except the odt to hold the atoms and molecules .",
    "at this moment , it was set as the time zero in our experimental timing sequence .",
    "then , the absorption image of rubidium atoms was taken after various holding times .",
    "the atomic clouds were imaged in two difference conditions of being with molecules (  pa \" ) and without molecules (  no pa \" ) .",
    "the  pa \" is denoted as that the pa laser was tuned to the pa resonance , as mentioned above .",
    "@xmath41 was produced and trapped in the odt simultaneously with the rubidium atoms .",
    "the pa laser frequency was verified by the mot trap loss signal .",
    "no pa \" is that the pa laser had a few ghz detuning away from the pa resonance and produced no molecules ( no mot trap loss observed ) , and only the rubidium atoms were trapped in the odt .",
    "experimentally , the only difference between  pa \" and  no pa \" is the _ frequency _ of the pa laser , and the rest of experimental conditions were kept the same for both , including the laser powers , the time sequence , the imaging process , and so forth .    the evolution of the number and the absorption images of the atomic @xmath25 in the crossed optical dipole trap after the single - photon photoassociation .",

    "the absorption images were analyzed to deduce the number and the density of atoms , as the technique commonly used in cold atom experiments .",
    "the density distribution of the atomic could be fitted to a gaussian profile with an elliptic shape , by which the temperature of the trapped atoms can be estimated , complementary to the free expansion image method .",
    "the evolution of the trapped atoms allows us to understand the inelastic collision behaviors of the rb atoms with the ultracold @xmath45 molecules in the odt .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ lossrate ] , the decay rate of the rubidium atoms for the  pa \" was found to be faster than the  no pa \" .",
    "the time evolution of the total number of the rubidium atoms are fitted very well to typical exponential decay curves : @xmath46 , in the both conditions of  pa `` and  no pa '' . for  no pa \" ,",
    "the effective loss rate constant @xmath47 is @xmath48 , including all the losses without molecule involved . for ",
    "pa \" , since the photoassociation had been performed and generated molecules accumulated in the odt , the faster decay of @xmath49 was attributed to the inelastic atom - molecule collision .",
    "while the pa laser was on the photoassociation resonance , the mot trap loss caused a smaller number of the atoms , as shown in the inset of fig.[traploss ] .",
    "hence , the initial loaded numbers of the atoms were slightly different between two conditions : @xmath50 ( in  no pa \" ) and @xmath51 ( in  pa \" ) .",
    "the decay rate of the number of the atoms caused by the atom - molecule collisions is proportional to the molecular number density @xmath52 and the atom - molecule collision rate @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", the decay curve should not be a straight line in a logarithmic scale ( fig.[lossrate ] ) , since time - dependence of the decay rate .",
    "however , the experimental data shows a very straight curve of the time evolution of the atoms in a logarithmic scale .",
    "it implies that the total number of the molecules is almost constant during the period of observation ; that is , there was a large number of molecules @xmath53 to maintain a constant decay rate : @xmath54 during 40  ms to 110  ms , and to set a lower bound for the number of molecules in the odt .",
    "the estimations of the collision rate and the molecular number can then be extracted from the experimental data using an atom - molecule collision loss model .    in an inelastic atom - molecule collision",
    ", the internal energy of the excitation released from the molecules was converted to kinetic energies to both rb and @xmath45 . since",
    "the vibrational energies of the molecule are large in comparison with the odt depth , it is justified to assume that both @xmath55 and @xmath45 were lost from the trap after an inelastic collision .",
