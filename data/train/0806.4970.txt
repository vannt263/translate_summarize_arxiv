    "the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy provides a potentially important heating source in a variety of galactic astrophysical environments , such as the solar wind ( e.g. , matthaeus et al .",
    "1999 ) , interstellar clouds ( e.g. , falgarone and puget 1995 ) , and the warm ionized medium ( e.g. , minter and balser 1997 ) . the effect of turbulent heating has also been studied in extragalactic environments , such as in the context of the broad - line regions of quasars ( bottorff & ferland 2002 ) , and in intracluster cooling flows ( dennis & chandran 2005 ) .",
    "astrophysical turbulence is often highly supersonic and magnetized .",
    "energy decay in supersonic turbulence was thought to be very rapid due to shocks ( e.g. , goldreich and kwan 1974 ) , while the presence of strong magnetic fields was believed to suppress the compressible modes and thus reduce the dissipation rate ( arons & max 1975 ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations offered a better understanding of energy dissipation in supersonic mhd turbulence ( stone et al .",
    "1998 , mac low et al .",
    "1998 , padoan and norlund 1999 ) . as in incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence , where the kinetic energy decays in a turnover time of the largest eddies , the dissipation timescale in supersonic mhd turbulence is of order the flow crossing timescale ( stone et al .",
    "1998 ) or , equivalently , the dynamical timescale at the driving scale ( mac low 1999 ) .    in typical molecular clouds",
    "the dynamical timescale is rather short , of order a million year , suggesting the need of continuous energy injection to support the observed turbulence .",
    "this result also implies a large turbulent heating rate .",
    "an estimate of the average dissipation rate from this timescale shows that it can be several times larger than the cosmic - ray heating rate , and thus may be the primary heating source in molecular clouds .",
    "stone et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also argued that the average turbulent heating rate can be comparable to the photoelectric heating in hi clouds with large velocity dispersions ( however , according to wolfire et al .",
    "2003 , the overall turbulent heating in the neutral medium may not be sufficient to produce the observed cii luminosity ) . in this paper",
    ", we provide a general theoretical formulation of the problem of turbulent heating , and investigate its effect on various types of interstellar clouds .",
    "turbulent dissipation is characterized by its strong spatial roughness ( see figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) .",
    "extreme dissipation events appear in the smallest structures occupying a tiny volume or mass fraction , while a significant fraction of the flow experiences essentially no dissipation .",
    "this implies a broad probability distribution of the dissipation rate , which must be taken into account for a consistent investigation of turbulent heating .",
    "the extended tail of this distribution at large dissipation rates , corresponding to highly dissipative structures , is responsible for the anomalous scaling of the high - order velocity structure functions , referred to as intermittency in turbulence theory ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "intermittency has been extensively studied in incompressible turbulence .",
    "the intermittent model by she and leveque ( 1994 ) , which considers a hierarchy of dissipation rates of different levels and relates them to the fractal dimension of the most intermittent dissipative structures , has been very successful in reproducing the measured scaling exponents of structure functions in incompressible turbulence .",
    "it has been shown that the model is equivalent to a log - poisson distribution of the dissipation rate ( dubrulle 1994 , she and waymire 1995 ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the dissipation rate in supersonic turbulence has not been studied yet .",
    "although the she and leveque model with a fractal dimension of 2 , corresponding to shocks , agrees well with the structure functions computed from numerical simulations of highly compressible turbulence ( boldyrev et al .",
    "2002 , padoan et al .",
    "2004 ) , it remains to be confirmed whether the distribution of the dissipation rate in supersonic turbulence is consistent with a log - poisson process .",
    "this theoretical concern and the wide application of an intermittency model of turbulent heating to various astrophysical environments are the primary motivations of the present work .",
    "an important effect of the intermittency of the turbulent dissipation is the generation of small regions with very large heating rate , and thus very high temperature .",
    "falgarone and puget ( 1995 ) were probably the first to recognize the importance of this effect in cold hi clouds .",
    "observed molecules , such as ch@xmath4 , suggest the existence of hot regions in cold hi clouds , because their production requires temperatures much higher than the average . adopting experimental results from incompressible turbulent flows , they found that strong local turbulent heating in hi clouds could produce a sufficient fraction of hot regions to explain the observed abundance of ch@xmath4 molecules . in this work",
    "we address the validity of their result in the case of an intermittency model for supersonic turbulence , more appropriate for cold hi clouds .    in  2 , we study the intermittent energy dissipation in supersonic turbulence .",
    "we show that the log - poisson intermittency model gives probability distributions for the dissipation rate in excellent agreement with those at the resolved scales of numerical simulations of supersonic turbulence . in  3 ,",
    "we discuss heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium and give the energy balance equations .",
    "we apply the log - poisson intermittency model to investigate turbulent heating in molecular clouds , high - mass star - forming cores , and cold hi clouds in  4 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "the energy dissipation rate in turbulent flows is known to exhibit fluctuations in both space and time .",
    "the viscous dissipation rate per unit mass is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity , and we have omitted the bulk viscosity , which is negligible for an ideal gas ( a good approximation for the interstellar medium ) .",
    "the divergence term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is necessary for compressible flows .",
    "clearly , in the presence of a fluctuating velocity field , the dissipation rate is expected to be inhomogeneous .",
    "kolmogorov s 1941 theory uses the average dissipation rate ( as the energy transfer rate in the inertial range ) and thus implicitly assumes spatial homogeneity in the dissipation rate .",
    "that theory is therefore not sufficient to study turbulent heating . because a significant fraction of the kinetic energy is viscously dissipated in the finest structures , such as vortex tubes and shocks ( in supersonic turbulence ) , which occupy only a small volume fraction ( or mass fraction for compressible turbulence ) , the dissipation rate is strongly intermittent .",
    "its probability distribution has a tail much more extended than that of a gaussian distribution , as the result of strong local dissipative events .",
    "a careful consideration of this intermittent distribution is essential for investigating turbulent heating . in the following ,",
    "we briefly review the intermittency theory .",
    "kolmogorov ( 1962 ) and oboukhov ( 1962 ) developed the first intermittency model for incompressible turbulence . to account for the fluctuations in the dissipation rate , they defined the dissipation rate , @xmath7 , at each scale @xmath8 and considered its probability distribution as a function of @xmath8 , which , together with the refined self - similarity hypothesis ( kolmogorov 1962 ) , was used to predict the scaling exponents of the velocity structure functions .",
    "generalizing to a compressible flow , the dissipation rate per unit mass at a scale @xmath8 is , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the volume of a spherical region of size @xmath8 and @xmath11 is the average density of that spherical region . from its definition",
    ", @xmath7 is a function of @xmath12 and we aim to study its spatial fluctuations .",
    "note that the average rate , @xmath7 , over a region of size @xmath8 defined here is different from @xmath13 used by falgarone and puget ( 1995 ) , which neglects the velocity gradient fluctuations in the region , and thus is valid only for @xmath8 smaller than the kolmogorov dissipation scale , @xmath14 , below which the velocity field is smooth and the velocity gradient is approximately constant .",
    "we point out that the pdf needed to study turbulent heating is that at the dissipation scale , the smallest scale of fluctuations in the dissipation rate . for this purpose , an ideal intermittency model to use",
    "is one for the dissipation range .",
    "however , most intermittency models , including the log - poisson model we will adopt below , are for the inertial scales , and we are not aware of theoretical models that give the pdf of the dissipation rate in the dissipation range . here , we take the following approach to obtain the pdf at the dissipation scale .",
    "we first focus on the inertial range and test an intermittency theory for the dissipation rate pdf in the inertial scales by comparing its predicted pdf at each scale with that computed from numerical simulations . if the theoretical pdf and its scale dependence agree with those from the simulation data , we extrapolate the model to obtain the pdf at the dissipation scale .",
    "this assumes that the pdf at the dissipation scale can be approximated by that extrapolated from the inertial scales .",
    "although there is no theoretical estimate for its accuracy , the assumption is justified by the expectation that the pdf in the dissipation range probably connects continuously and smoothly to that in the inertial range and is supported by our numerical results ( see below )",
    ".    the probability distribution , @xmath15 , of the dissipation rate , @xmath7 , at a scale @xmath8 can be calculated as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total volume of the system and @xmath18 is the overall average density in the flow .",
    "we have used the density as a weighting factor ( @xmath19 , which is unity for incompressible turbulence ) to account for the density variations in supersonic turbulence .",
    "this density or mass weighting is supported by kritsuk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who find that replacing the velocity field @xmath20 by @xmath21 gives a 3rd order structure function in supersonic turbulence in agreement with kolmogorov s 4/5 law .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the density - weighted average dissipation rate , @xmath22 , is the same over all the inertial scales .",
    "this is built in our definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath23 which is independent of @xmath8 , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we will therefore denote the average dissipation rate @xmath22 as @xmath24 . clearly , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the rms velocity of the flow and @xmath27 is the integral scale .",
    "another reason for choosing the density weighted distribution is that we want to estimate the mass - weighted average temperature resulting from the turbulent heating of interstellar clouds .",
    "kolmogorov ( 1962 ) and oboukhov ( 1962 ) proposed a log - normal distribution for @xmath7 , for which yaglom ( 1966 ) gave a justification with a self - similar eddy - fragmentation argument .",
    "the variance of the log - normal distribution is assumed to be proportional to the number of cascade steps , @xmath28 ln@xmath29 , from the integral scale , @xmath27 , to the scale of interest , @xmath8 .",
    "experiments by ansemet et al .",
    "( 1984 ) find that the scaling exponents of the structure functions agree with the log - normal model at low orders , but depart from it at orders @xmath30 .",
    "the log - normal model has also been shown to violate some theoretical requirements on the structure function exponents in incompressible turbulence ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "numerical simulations find that the log - normal distribution of the dissipation rate is quite a good approximation in the inertial range and is valid up to about 4 - 5 @xmath31 , beyond which a departure from the simulations is clearly seen ( e.g. , yueng et al .",
    "this departure explains the deviation of the model from the measured structure functions in the experiments . in this work",
    "we do not consider the log - normal model ( which was proposed for incompressible turbulence ) , because it gives a poor fit to @xmath15 computed in our simulations of supersonic turbulence .",
    "a different intermittency model has recently been proposed by she and leveque ( 1994 ) .",
    "the scaling exponents of structure functions of order up to 10 predicted by this model for incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence agree with experimental data with an accuracy of 1% . in their original paper , she and leveque start from the hierarchy of dissipation rates at each scale . by invoking a `` hidden symmetry '' that relates the dissipation rate at different intensity levels to the strongest dissipative structures at a given scale @xmath8 , they determine the whole hierarchy of dissipation rates from the fractal dimension of the most intermittent structures and from the scaling of the dissipation rate of these structures with @xmath8 .",
    "the `` hidden symmetry '' was speculated to be an unknown symmetry of the navier - stokes equation and was immediately recognized as corresponding to a log - poisson process in a multiplicative energy cascade model .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to incompressible mhd turbulence ( muller and biskamp 2000 ) , supersonic turbulence ( boldyrev et al . 2002 ) and super - alvnic turbulent flows ( padoan et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these studies compute the scaling exponents of the structure functions from numerical simulations and compare them to the prediction of the log - poisson model with different fractal dimensions for the most intermittent structures .",
    "they find that a 2d geometry of the most intermittent structures , corresponding to current sheets in mhd turbulence or shocks in highly supersonic turbulence , gives an excellent fit to the simulation results . here , instead of considering the scaling exponents of the structure functions , we focus on the log - poisson version of the she - leveque model and",
    "compare the model directly with the probability distribution , @xmath15 , measured in simulations of supersonic mhd turbulence .",
    "our purpose is to check whether this model agrees with numerical simulations .",
    "if so , we can first `` calibrate '' it by fitting resolved inertial scales in the simulations , and then extrapolate it to high reynolds number flows . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief description of the log - poisson model .",
    "the interested reader is referred to dubrulle ( 1994 ) and to she and waymire ( 1995 ) for more details ( see also pan et al .",
    "2008 , which includes both the original presentation by she and leveque and the log - poisson version ) .",
    "the log - poisson model is a multiplicative cascade model where the dissipation rates at two scales , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are related by a multiplicative factor , @xmath34 , @xmath35 since the average dissipation rate at each scale is equal to the overall average dissipation rate @xmath24 ( see above ) , the average of the multiplicative factor , @xmath36 , is required to be unity . according to the speculation by she and waymire ( 1995 ) ,",
    "two types of events determine @xmath34 .",
    "one is the amplification of the dissipation rate that tends to cause singular structures at small scales .",
    "the other , called the modulation - defects by she and waymire , corresponds to the failure of structures at scale @xmath32 to turn into the most dissipative structures at scale @xmath33 in the cascade .",
    "the first type of events is assumed to give an amplification factor of @xmath37 , which approaches infinity as @xmath38 for positive @xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 measures how intense the most intermittent structures at scale @xmath33 can be . assuming that the kinetic energy per unit mass available for dissipation in the most intermittent structures is @xmath40 ,",
    "where @xmath26 is the rms velocity at the integral scale , and that the dynamical timescale @xmath41 in these structures follows the regular kolmogorov scaling , @xmath42 , she and leveque ( 1994 ) argued that the energy dissipation rate in these intense structures is @xmath43 , which suggests that @xmath44 .",
    "the modulation - defects are assumed to be a discrete process , where each defect reduces @xmath34 by a factor of @xmath45 and the number of defects , @xmath46 , occurring in the cascade from @xmath32 to @xmath33 is assumed to obey a poisson distribution .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath45 will be discussed below .",
    "these arguments are represented by two equations , @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the average number of defects in the cascade from @xmath33 to @xmath32 .",
    "requiring @xmath50 gives @xmath51 .",
    "as expected , @xmath49 is proportional to the number of steps in the cascade , @xmath52 .    taking the logarithm of eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , we see that the distribution of @xmath7 is log - poisson .",
    "given the probability distribution at one scale , the distribution of @xmath7 at any other scale @xmath8 can be derived using eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) . the convenient scale to start with is the integral scale , @xmath27 , where the distribution , @xmath53 , of the dissipation rate mainly depends on the forcing of the flow and thus is probably flow - dependent .",
    "however , the dissipation rate , @xmath54 , at @xmath27 is close to the average , @xmath55 , and hence @xmath53 is expected to be narrow and approximately a delta function . given @xmath56 , we find that @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "note that if @xmath53 is a delta function , then @xmath15 is discrete with a series of spikes .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath45 in the log - poisson version of the model is not clear . deriving the moments of the distribution @xmath15 from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) and comparing with the original version of the model , one finds that @xmath45 here corresponds to the same @xmath45 parameter introduced in the `` hidden symmetry '' by she and leveque ( 1994 ) , which has been related to the fractal dimension of the most intermittent structures , @xmath0 , and the parameter @xmath39 by @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being the dimension of the system .",
    "here we omit the derivation of this relation that can be found , e.g. , in pan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . for vortex tubes ,",
    "the dimension is @xmath61 and for shocks @xmath62 . because in supersonic turbulence about 1/3 of the energy is dissipated in dilatational modes and 2/3 in solenoidal modes ( kritsuk et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath0 is expected to be between 1 and 2 .",
    "we compare the log - poisson distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , with results from a numerical simulation of supersonic mhd turbulence .",
    "we examine how well this model can be extended to supersonic mhd flows and what fractal dimension of the most intense dissipative structures gives the best fit to the simulation .",
    "we take 6 snapshots from the 1000@xmath63 stagger - code mhd simulation in padoan et al .",
    "the simulation adopts periodic boundary conditions , isothermal equation of state , random forcing in fourier space at wavenumbers @xmath64 ( @xmath65 corresponds to the computational box size ) , uniform initial density and magnetic field , and random initial velocity field with power only at wavenumbers @xmath66 .",
    "the simulation is both supersonic and super - alfvnic , with an rms sonic mach number of @xmath67 , and an initial rms alfvnic mach number of @xmath68 .",
    "after a few dynamical times , the magnetic energy is amplified by the turbulence , and the rms alfvnic mach number with respect to the rms magnetic field is @xmath69 , still super - alfvnic .    in each snapshot , we evaluate the dissipation rate at the grid points according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "a complication arises as a result of the limited numerical resolution .",
    "the dissipation rate should be calculated at the kolmogorov scale using the kinematic viscosity , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the sound speed , @xmath46 the number density and @xmath31 the collision cross section .",
    "this is not possible because the resolution scale in the simulation is much larger than the kolmogorov scale .",
    "we can not use the kinematic viscosity to calculate the dissipation rate at the grid points , because that neglects the fluctuations in velocity gradients below the grid scale and would underestimate the dissipation rate in each computational cell . to avoid this ,",
    "we are forced to use an effective viscosity at the grid size to account for the sub - grid fluctuations erased by the numerical viscosity . in principle , the effective viscosity at each grid depends on the sub - grid fluctuations and ( perhaps weakly ) on the local kolmogorov scale ( which varies in space because the kinematic viscosity @xmath6 depends on density ) . due to the lack of information about sub - grid scales",
    ", we simply assume the effective viscosity is constant , and normalize it so that the mean dissipation rate averaged over all the grid points is equal to the overall dissipation rate of the flow , @xmath72 . with this assumption",
    ", we calculate the dissipation rate in each computational cell .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the logarithm of the dissipation rate ( upper panel ) and density ( lower panel ) on a slice of a snapshot of the simulation .",
    "both the dissipation rate and the density have a filamentary structure .",
    "dense filaments are usually sites of strong dissipation , but filaments of high dissipation rate are also found at the interface of low and high density regions . as a result ,",
    "the dissipation rate and the gas density are practically uncorrelated .",
    "this lack of statistical correlation between dissipation rate and gas density is apparent when comparing images of projected dissipation rate and projected density , shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "structures in these two images appear to be rather independent of each other .",
    "the correlation coefficient between dissipation rate and gas density , computed over all the computational cells of one snapshot , is very low , -0.11 , as illustrated by the scatter plot of figure  [ f3 ] , for 10,000 randomly selected computational cells of one snapshot .    from the dissipation rate at each computational cell ,",
    "we compute the average dissipation rate , @xmath7 , at any larger scale @xmath8 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ( instead of calculating the average over spheres , we compute that over cubes of size @xmath8 from the simulation data ) .",

    "the distribution becomes broader toward smaller scales , indicating the dissipation rate is more intermittent at smaller scales .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath77 is strongly skewed toward small values , suggesting that a log - normal model can not give a satisfactory fit to the numerical results .",

    "note that the motivation of the log - poisson model was to explain the tail at large dissipation rates corresponding to high - order structure functions .",
    "it turns out that this model provides a surprisingly good fit to the tail of low dissipation rates as well .",

    "we think the measurement uncertainty at small scales is probably small because of the large number of sampling cubes ( thus we put more weight to the pdf towards smaller scales ) and the snapshot - to - snapshot variations at these scales may primarily reflect the intrinsic temporal fluctuations ( which corresponds to the variations in the predicted temperature from time to time ) .",
    "we calculated the standard deviation of log ( p ) in different @xmath85 bins over the 6 snapshots . in fig . 5",

    "error bars of similar size are also obtained for other scales ( the size of error bars for the scale , l/64 , is about 60% larger than those in fig .",
    "this is because the measurement uncertainty is larger due to the smaller number of sampling cubes . ) .",
    "we see that the snapshot - to - snapshot variation is quite small except at the far right tail ( the effect of which will be discussed later in  4.3 ) . from the two curves representing the log - poisson model with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( normalized to that with @xmath89 , we find that the model gives acceptable fits to the measured pdf within the 1-@xmath31 error bars , for a range of values of the dimension @xmath0 between @xmath87 and @xmath88",

    "reynolds numbers in interstellar turbulence are much larger than can be resolved by current numerical simulations . because the intermittency theory can only be verified by simulations with limited resolution , the extrapolation of the theory to a realistic value of @xmath91 remains uncertain .",

    "( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) , we find a gas temperature of 57  k , suggesting a strong thermal coupling between gas and dust , as mentioned above .",
    "the gas heating rate per unit volume by dust grains is @xmath202  ergs  @xmath102  s@xmath3 , which is only @xmath203 times the heating rate of the dust grains by the stellar radiation field .",
    "thus the dust temperature is not affected by the energy transfer to the gas .",
    "we then calculate the gas temperature at @xmath194  pc assuming the gas is heated both by the dust and by the turbulence .",
    "the average turbulent heating rate in these cores is @xmath204  ergs  @xmath102  s@xmath3 , which is larger than the rate from collisions with dust grains when the turbulence is neglected .",
    "the inclusion of turbulent heating should therefore result in a gas temperature larger than 57  k. using again the intermittency model with @xmath1 , we obtain a mean gas temperature of 64  k , very close to the dust temperature of 65  k. in summary , the gas and the dust temperatures in this dense inner region are very well coupled , but the turbulent heating can still increase the gas temperature by a few degrees .",
    "the outer region is interesting because it contains most of the mass of the core and because its density is lower and so gas and dust are less well coupled .",
    "we carry out the same calculation as above for the outer region , at @xmath189  pc , assuming a density of @xmath205-@xmath206  @xmath102 and a dust temperature of @xmath207  k. neglecting turbulent heating , we obtain a gas temperature of 17  k and 6  k , for @xmath208 and @xmath178  @xmath102 respectively ( including cosmic ray - heating increases the temperature to 18  k and 10  k respectively ) . in this case",
    "the gas temperature is considerably smaller than the dust temperature due to the weak coupling ( while with @xmath209 @xmath102 the gas and dust temperatures would be almost equal ) . as we did for the inner region ,",
    "we now include the turbulent heating . for illustration , we assume the average dissipation rate is independent of radius . without energy transfer between dust and gas",
    ", we find that the intermittent turbulent heating alone would give a temperature of 36  k and 35  k , for @xmath205 and @xmath206  @xmath102 respectively .",
    "the gas temperature is here nearly independent of the density because at densities above @xmath178  @xmath102 the cooling rate per particle is almost constant ( see goldsmith and langer 1978 ) . because in this outer region the thermal coupling between dust and gas is weak , we find that including both the energy transfer between dust and gas and the intermittent turbulent heating , the gas temperature is still 35 - 36  k. in other words , in the outer region of the cores , containing most of the core mass , the gas is thermally decoupled from the dust and its temperature is completely determined by the turbulent heating .",
    "similar to the case of molecular clouds , we find that range of @xmath0 from 1.56 to 1.71 results in a small range for the average temperature , within 1.5 - 2 k ( i.e. , @xmath2 5% ) , around the value 35 - 36 k obtained for @xmath1 .    our result is in general agreement with the observations of high - mass protostellar objects by leurini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . by fitting the observed methanol spectral lines",
    ", they derive the physical parameters of a model consisting of an inner core , an extended component , and an outflow .",
    "in particular , they find the kinetic temperature is in range of 22 - 40 k in the extended component ( corresponding to the outer regions in our model ) where the fwhm linewidth is 2.8 - 4.2 km @xmath3 ( see their table 5 ) over an average size of 0.1 pc ( smaller then the value of 0.3 pc we adopted above ) . with these specific parameters , and the density range of @xmath210 @xmath102 ( table 5 in leurini et al .",
    "2007 ) , our model would predict a temperature range of 28 - 39 k. although the velocity dispersion here is lower than adopted in our example , the size is also smaller , resulting in a dissipation rate and a temperature comparable to those in our example above .",
    "future observations with high spatial resolution will provide a better test of our model .",
    "we conclude that , although negligible in comparison with the dust heating rate by the central stellar sources , turbulent heating in high - mass star - forming cores provides an important energy source for the gas . for a characteristic density of @xmath180  @xmath102 in the inner regions ,",
    "the gas and dust temperatures are well coupled .",
    "the turbulent heating increases the gas temperature only by a few degrees .",
    "this slight temperature increase in the inner regions may not have important observational or dynamical consequences . on the other hand ,",
    "the turbulent heating has significant effects in the outer regions , where the density is lower and the coupling of dust and gas is weaker than in the inner regions . for a characteristic dust temperature of 20 - 30  k and a density of @xmath107-@xmath211 , the turbulent heating increases the gas temperature from less than 10 - 20  k ( lower than the dust temperature ) up to about 36  k. this large increase in the gas temperature by a factor of 2 - 3 due to turbulent heating , in the region containing most of the core mass , may have important effects on the evolution of the cores , on their star formation efficiency , and on their stellar initial mass function .",
    "future observations of these cores may help determine their gas temperature with sufficient accuracy to constrain the relative importance of turbulent heating .",
    "the observed abundance of ch@xmath4 , hco@xmath4 , and oh molecules in cold diffuse clouds ( crane et al .",
    "1995 , gredel 1997 , lucas and liszt 1996 , liszt and lucas 1996 ) suggests the existence of hot regions inside these clouds .",
    "the activation temperature of reactions producing these molecules is @xmath212  k , while the cloud average temperature is @xmath213  k. dissipative heating by mhd shocks and vortex tubes have been proposed to explain the existence of hot regions ( see , e.g. , pety and falgarone 2000 ) .",
    "these dissipative structures are the most intermittent structures in the log - poisson model of the turbulent energy dissipation .",
    "since the model gives the distribution of the dissipation rate at all intensity levels , it can be used to calculate the cumulative probability corresponding to the mass fraction of regions with @xmath118 k. falgarone and puget ( 1995 ) performed a similar calculation .",
    "they used the probability distribution of the velocity difference from experiments with incompressible flows , where the strong dissipative structures responsible for the hot regions are vortex tubes .",
    "it is not clear whether their result applies to supersonic turbulence in diffuse neutral clouds , where both shocks and vortex tubes contribute to high temperatures .",
    "the log - poisson intermittency model for supersonic turbulence includes both types of dissipation structures .",
    "we will compare the result by falgarone and puget ( 1995 ) with that from the log - poisson model for incompressible turbulence and for supersonic flows presented in   2 .",
    "for the characteristic density and length scale of cold neutral clouds we adopt @xmath214  @xmath102 and @xmath27=1  pc ( helies and troland 2003 ) .",
    "the observed 1d rms turbulent velocity , @xmath150 , at the scale of 1  pc , is between 1 and 3  km  s@xmath3 ( hennebelle et al .",
    "the average turbulent heating rate is @xmath215 km s@xmath216  ergs  s@xmath3 per h atom .",
    "we will treat @xmath150 as a parameter and study the dependence of the mass fraction of hot regions on @xmath150 . as discussed in   3 ,",
    "the photoelectric heating rate in cold neutral clouds is @xmath217 ergs s@xmath3 per h atom . neglecting turbulent heating ,",
    "this gives a temperature of 53 k using the cii and oi cooling rates from wolfire et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . at @xmath214 @xmath102 ,",
    "the gas - dust coupling is very weak and their energy balance equations can be solved separately .",
    "we now consider the effect of turbulent heating .",
    "first we neglect intermittency and use the average dissipation rate , and then we include the effect of intermittency using the log - poisson model . assuming @xmath218  km  s@xmath3 as an example , we find that the temperature increases to 63  k , much smaller than the 1000  k required for production of ch@xmath4 .",
    "temperatures much higher than the average can only be obtained if intermittency is included . in the temperature range from 100  k to 8000  k",
    ", the cooling rate as a function of temperature is very flat , meaning that hotter gas is more difficult to cool .",
    "this suggests that temperature fluctuations in this range of values reduce the overall cooling efficiency .",
    "therefore , the net effect of fluctuations in the dissipation rate is that of producing a higher mean temperature than in the case of a uniform dissipation rate ( contrary to the case of molecular clouds , where the cooling rate depends on temperature very sensitively ) .",
    "for example , if the dimension of the most intense dissipative structures is @xmath1 , the average temperature derived for @xmath218  km  s@xmath3 is 100  k ( versus 63  k in the case of a uniform dissipation rate ) .",
    "furthermore , the flat cooling curve helps the generation of hot regions due to the fluctuations in the dissipation rate , so the extended high - rate tail of the dissipation rate distribution translates into a fairly extended high temperature tail in the temperature distribution .",
    "we calculated the gas temperature probability distribution using @xmath1 for the most dissipative structures in the intermittency model .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] shows the cumulative probability of temperatures lower than @xmath121 for different rms velocities . from the cumulative probability curve",
    ", we can read the fraction of gas with temperature larger than 1000  k. for @xmath219 , 2 , and 3  km  s@xmath3 , the probabilities of finding @xmath118  k are 3.6@xmath220 , 3@xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively . since the hot gas fraction needed to explain the observed abundance of ch@xmath4 molecules is a few percent ( gredel et al .",
    "1993 ) , our result shows that cold neutral clouds , where molecules such as ch@xmath4 are detected , must have a minimum rms turbulent velocity of 3  km  s@xmath3 at the scale of 1  pc .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath0 within the range 1.56 - 1.71 corresponds to a range of the cumulative probability of only @xmath2 2 - 3% around the value of 0.019 found for @xmath1 and @xmath223 km s@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath0 does not affect our conclusion for the minimum rms velocity required to produce enough hot regions to explain the abundance of ch@xmath4 molecules .",
    "one may expect the large uncertainty at the far right tail ( fig .",
    "5 ) may significantly affect the cumulative probability .",
    "however , for @xmath224 km s@xmath3 , 1000 k corresponds to a dissipation rate only 10 times larger than the average ( see below for a discussion of a wider range of @xmath0 , between 1 and 2 )",
    ". therefore the cumulative probability is not determined by the far tail , but mainly by the part of the pdf where there are no significant snapshot - to- snapshot variations , as can be seen from fig .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] also shows that most of the gas has temperature below 100  k , which is the mean temperature in the case of @xmath218  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this is because the skewness of the dissipation rate distribution favors values below the average .    to study how the degree of intermittency affects the mass fraction of hot regions , we consider different values ( beyond the range 1.56 - 1.71 ) of the dimension of the most intense dissipative structures .",
    "we choose two special vales , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , corresponding to vortex tubes and shocks .",
    "the dissipation rate is more intermittent for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that , if @xmath219  km  s@xmath3 , the cumulative probability for @xmath118 k depends on @xmath0 very sensitively .",
    "it is @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , for @xmath223  km  s@xmath3 , the degree of intermittency does not affect the probability by much ; the cumulative probability is 0.015 and 0.021 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , close to the value of 0.019 that we previously found for @xmath1 .",
    "this is because for @xmath219  km  s@xmath3 the average dissipation rate is low , and a temperature of @xmath227  k requires the far tail of the dissipation rate distribution , which strongly depends on the degree of intermittency . for @xmath223  km  s@xmath3 , instead",
    ", @xmath227  k corresponds to a dissipation rate only approximately 10 times larger than the average . in the range of values about an order of magnitude around the average",
    ", there is no considerable difference in the dissipation rate distribution for different dimensions of the dissipative structures .",
    "falgarone and puget ( 1995 ) adopted an rms velocity of 3  km  s@xmath3 at 1  pc , and used experimental results for the probability distribution of the dissipation rate of incompressible turbulence ( converted from the velocity difference distribution ) .",
    "their model corresponds to our model with @xmath61 .",
    "they obtained a mass fraction of a few percent ( see their figure 4 ) for gas with @xmath118  k , consistent with our result using the same parameters .",
    "therefore , puget and falgarone s model , physically valid only if the turbulence in cold atomic clouds were subsonic , gives by chance a result similar to that of our model for supersonic turbulence .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the intermittent turbulent heating can generate enough hot regions to produce the observed ch@xmath4 abundance in cold neutral clouds if the turbulent rms velocity , @xmath150 , is large enough .",
    "the required minimum value for @xmath150 is approximately 3  km  s@xmath3 at a length scale of 1  pc .",
    "we have studied the energy dissipation and the heating in supersonic turbulence .",
    "the turbulent dissipation is characterized by strongly intermittent fluctuations .",
    "a significant fraction of the kinetic energy is viscously dissipated in the finest , most intermittent structures , giving rise to a broad tail in the probability distribution function of the dissipation rate . to study the turbulent heating in interstellar clouds , a theoretical model is needed for the probability distribution of the dissipation rate at the dissipation scale , @xmath14 .",
    "we have generalized the log - poisson model , originally proposed for incompressible turbulence by she and leveque ( 1994 ) , to supersonic turbulence .",
    "because the dissipation scale , @xmath14 , can not be resolved by current numerical simulations , we have used results from resolved inertial - range scales in our numerical simulation of supersonic and super - alfvnic turbulence as a guideline for the sub - grid scales .",
    "we have found that the log - poisson model , with a fractal dimension @xmath1 for the most intermittent dissipative structures , gives an excellent fit to the mass - weighted probability distribution of the dissipation rate at resolved scales in the simulation . extrapolating the model to the corresponding reynolds numbers",
    ", we have studied the turbulent heating in molecular clouds , high - mass star - forming cores , and cold diffuse neutral clouds . here",
    "we summarize our results .    1 .   in typical molecular clouds , the average turbulent heating rate exceeds the cosmic ray heating rate by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "fluctuations in the heating rate give a lower mean temperature than expected from the average heating rate ; temperature fluctuations make cooling more efficient because in molecular clouds the cooling rate increases sensitively with temperature .",
    "taking intermittency into account , the turbulent heating alone gives a mean temperature of approximately 8.5  k , close to the characteristic temperature of molecular clouds .",
    "this would suggest that cosmic rays are not even needed to explain the thermal balance in molecular clouds .",
    "however , due to the intermittent fluctuations in the turbulent heating rate , a significant mass fraction of the molecular gas is not heated by the turbulence .",
    "cosmic ray heating would dominate in these regions .",
    "assuming a cosmic ray heating rate of @xmath228 , the turbulent heating increases the average temperature by a few degrees , from 9.5  k to 13  k. we also find that turbulent heating plays a similar role in the outer regions of the dark cloud cores in the orion molecular cloud complex .",
    "2 .   turbulent heating provides an important energy source for the molecular gas in high - mass star - forming cores . assuming spherical symmetry , in the inner regions of these cores ( within @xmath229  pc from the center ) , stellar sources heat the dust grains to a relatively high temperature . due to the high density of these inner regions ( @xmath144  @xmath102 ) ,",
    "the gas and dust are thermally coupled , and the gas temperature is close to the dust temperature even in the absence of turbulent heating",
    ". the turbulent heating increases the gas temperature only by a few k. on the other hand , in the outer regions ( @xmath230  pc from the center ) , where most of the core mass resides , the turbulent heating results in a considerable increase in the gas temperature .",
    "the low density of these regions ( @xmath178-@xmath206  @xmath102 ) makes energy exchange between gas and dusts inefficient and , without turbulent heating , the energy transfer from the dust heats the gas only to 10 - 20  k. inclusion of turbulent heating increases the temperature to approximately 36  k. because turbulent heating causes a large temperature increase in most of the core mass , it may have important implications for the dynamical evolution of the cores and for their star - formation process , and it may also be probed by future observations",
    ". 3 .   the intermittent turbulent heating in diffuse hi clouds can give rise to regions much hotter than the average temperature .",
    "these warm regions have been used to explain the existence of molecules such as ch@xmath4 in hi clouds , whose production needs high temperatures . using the log - poisson intermittency model for supersonic turbulence",
    ", we find that a turbulent rms velocity of 3  km  s@xmath3 at 1  pc is sufficient to account for the observed abundance of these molecules , which extends the earlier result , based on incompressible turbulence , by falgarone and puget ( 1995 ) .",
    "we point out that thermal conduction is neglected in our calculations .",
    "conduction tends to transport thermal energy to fill in regions not significantly heated by dissipation , and thus may , to some degree , erase the fluctuations in the heating rate . as discussed in   4 , more intermittent fluctuations in the heating rate give a smaller average temperature in molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , if thermal conduction were included , the average temperature in molecular clouds and in the outer regions of high - mass star - forming cores would be even larger , making turbulent heating even more important in these two cases (   4.1 and ",
    "the situation is different in cold diffuse hi clouds (   4.3 ) .",
    "if the fluctuations in the heating rate are less intermittent there , the average temperature becomes smaller and , more importantly , the tail of the temperature probability distribution , needed for ch@xmath231 production , would be less extended .",
    "we estimate whether and how much thermal conduction would change our results by calculating the conduction length scale , @xmath232 , during a cooling time scale , @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the thermal conduction coefficient ( approximately equal to the kinematic viscosity , @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is the scale over which thermal conduction can homogenize before the heat from turbulent dissipation is radiated away .",
    "we find that in molecular clouds and in hi clouds @xmath235 is smaller than ( but comparable to ) the dissipation length scale , @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the heat generated in the most intermittent structures can not be transported far from these structures by thermal conduction .",
    "this justifies our choice of computing the temperature distribution by using the dissipation rate distribution evaluated at @xmath14 . in the outer regions of high - mass star - forming cores",
    ", @xmath235 is about an order of magnitude larger than @xmath14 ( the latter is very small because of the very large reynolds number ) . using the distribution of the dissipation rate at @xmath235 instead of @xmath14 ( assuming thermal conduction homogenizes the temperature over a size of @xmath235 ) gives an average temperature of 40  k in the outer regions of these cores , a little higher than from the distribution of the dissipation rate evaluated at @xmath14 .",
    "however , the conduction process in the presence of turbulent motions is more complex than described by the above estimate , and a detailed study of its effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "although so far neglected , the process of turbulent heating may play an important role in the process of star formation . the mean temperature in molecular clouds",
    "defines the mean jeans mass , which may control the peak of the stellar mass distribution . because we have found that the mean temperature in molecular clouds and in high - mass star - forming cores may be controlled by turbulent heating , the characteristic stellar mass may be affected by turbulent heating as well .",
    "for example , the larger gas temperature predicted in high - mass star - forming cores may partly offset their large density , resulting in almost the same characteristic stellar mass , with respect to molecular clouds following larson s relations . finally , because the process of turbulent heating results in broad gas temperature distributions",
    ", it may be crucial in many molecular chemical reactions , besides those responsible for the formation of ch@xmath4 molecules .",
    "this research was partially supported by a nasa atp grant nng056601 g , and by an nrac allocation mca098020s .",
    "we utilized computing resources provided by the san diego supercomputer center , by the national center for supercomputing applications and by nasa high end computing program .",

    "<S> our main results are : i ) the mean gas temperature in molecular clouds can be explained as the effect of turbulent heating alone , while cosmic ray heating may dominate only in regions where the turbulent heating is low ; ii ) the mean gas temperature in high - mass star - forming cores with typical fwhm of @xmath2 6 km s@xmath3 ( corresponding to a 1d rms velocity of 2.5 km s@xmath3 ) may be completely controlled by turbulent heating , which predicts a mean value of approximately 36  k , two to three times larger than the mean gas temperature in the absence of turbulent heating ; iii ) the intermittency of the turbulent heating can generate enough hot regions in cold diffuse hi clouds to explain the observed ch@xmath4 abundance , if the rms velocity on a scale of 1  pc is at least 3  km  s@xmath3 , in agreement with previous results based on incompressible turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> because of its importance in the thermal balance of molecular clouds and high - mass star - forming cores , the process of turbulent heating may be central in setting the characteristic stellar mass and in regulating molecular chemical reactions . </S>"
