    "ngc  55 is a dwarf ( @xmath4 ) member of the sculptor group , a nearby group dominated by spiral galaxies such as ngc  300 and the famous starburst ngc  253 . at a distance of 1.78  mpc @xcite , the high inclination of ngc  55 ( 81 ;",

    "ngc  55 has a large ( @xmath730 ) but well - defined angular extent and so was chosen to test the imaging capabilities of the instrument on extended sources with both high and low surface brightness regions .",
    "these commissioning observations proved to be of sufficient quality to support scientific analysis . in this paper , we measure global properties of the galaxy ( temperature , luminosity , scale height as a function of wavelength , and star formation rate ) and exploit the sensitivity and resolution of mips to determine the distribution of temperatures and luminosities within the galaxy and to address the nature of the nuclear source . we refer to other papers in this volume for topics best studied in more face - on galaxies : 1 . ) star formation rate indicators in m  81 @xcite ; 2 . )",

    "3232 individual images at each of the three mips bands were taken , with an exposure time of approximately 4 seconds per image .",
    "the depth of the map at each point was 240 , 120 , and 24 seconds at 24 , 70 , and 160  , respectively .",
    "the resulting mosaics cover an area of approximately @xmath8 at each wavelength , with a region in common to all three wavelengths of @xmath9 .",
    "the mips images were reduced using the mips instrument team data analysis tool which is the test bed for data reduction algorithms for mips @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced as described in that paper , with some minor exceptions : a customized flat field was required at 24  , and a time - dependent illumination correction and calibration lamp latent image removal were required at 70  .",
    "the uncertainties on the calibration are estimated at 10% , 20% , and 20% for 24 , 70 , and 160  , respectively ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in the absolute calibration  uncertainties in the background level for this target are around 5% and so have not been included in subsequent analysis .",

    "the beam sizes in the three mips bands are limited by diffraction and so vary with wavelength : the fwhm of the point - spread - function ( psf ) is 6 , 18 , and 40  at 24 , 70 , and 160  , respectively . where images have been compared directly at different wavelengths , they have been convolved to matching resolutions ( the 160  resolution , unless otherwise noted ) using kernels derived from psf models generated using the tinytim software @xcite",
    "the morphology of the galaxy in the mips images is broadly similar , being dominated by a bright central region and asymmetric emission from the disk on either side .",
    "the extent of the galaxy ( both in the optical and far infrared ( fir ) ) is @xmath0  to the nw of the nuclear region and @xmath10to the se .",
    "the central region and the region to the se are separated by a low - surface - brightness gap that crosses the galaxy at @xmath11 .",
    "the 24  emission is dominated by discrete regions , in contrast to the smoother structure seen at 70 and 160  .",
    "these discrete emission regions also dominate the nuclear region ( which we have assumed lies at the 24  peak ) , as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : optical ] .",
    "we performed photometry on the 24  image using the daophot package in iraf .",
    "the luminosities of the extracted point sources are plotted in figure  [ fig : lum24 ] , where we simply multiplied the measured flux density by the 24  bandpass to determine the in - band flux and thence the luminosity .",
    "we have made a correction for the background point sources in the ngc  55 image by subtracting the luminosity function measured in a background region of identical size , well away from the galaxy .",
    "the integrated flux of the extracted point sources is more than @xmath1 of the total 24  emission from this galaxy .",
    "the brightest point source is located near the center of ngc  55 . as demonstrated by figure",
    "[ fig : optical ] , this 24  peak is nearly an arcminute ( a projected separation of 520  pc ) away from the peak i - band emission .",
    "this source appears to be hidden behind a strong dust lane apparent in the i - band image and is responsible for @xmath0% of the total emission at 24  .",
    "this source is marginally resolved at 24  the measured fwhm of the source is @xmath753 .",
    "the edge - on aspect of the galaxy provides a unique opportunity to measure infrared scale heights .",
    "we generated profiles along the major and minor axes of ngc  55 by averaging the images ( convolved to the 160  resolution ) parallel and perpendicular to the disk of the galaxy .",
    "these profiles are presented in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , in which the psf measured on an unresolved galaxy in the field is plotted for reference .",
    "the profiles have all been normalized to the same peak value .",
    "the extent of the observed emission is correlated with wavelength : the emission is more extended at longer wavelengths , along both the major and minor axes .",
    "the major - axis profile is highly asymmetric , with an off - center nuclear region and discrete emission regions evident in the eastern portion of the disk .",
    "the minor - axis profile is more symmetric , and we fit it with a function proportional to @xmath12 , where x is the distance from the emission peak and h is the scale height .",
    "the scale height is 0.32 , 0.43 , and 0.49  kpc at 24 , 70 and 160  .",
    "these values are higher than the value of @xmath13  kpc determined by @xcite for the stellar component of ngc  55 but are comparable to the @xmath14  kpc scale height for the ionized gas determined by @xcite .",
    "we computed the fir sed of ngc  55 using mips data , combined with measurements by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) , the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) , and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "the total emission in the mips images was measured using iraf s `` polyphot '' task , while the iras measurements were taken from @xcite .",
    "the dirbe measurements were computed using the dirbe point source photometry research tool , and the 2mass measurements were taken from @xcite .",
    "we fit the fluxes with two modified blackbody functions to characterize roughly the dust temperature and found a good fit with two components at 51  k and 19  k , modified by a @xmath15 emissivity ( adopted as an appropriate factor beyond 70  ; cf .",
    "the data and the fit are plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the total infrared ( tir ) luminosity was estimated from both the mips and iras fluxes using equations 4 and 5 of @xcite , respectively : both equations indicate the luminosity of ngc  55 is @xmath16 . additionally , the bolometric ir luminosity was computed from the data directly , integrating the two - temperature blackbody fit discussed above ( plus a linear fit to the 2mass and 12  data where the blackbody falls short of the observed emission ) from 3 - 1100  to compute a luminosity of @xmath17 .",
    "we have averaged these three estimates to compute @xmath18 .",
    "the star formation rate implied by this luminosity is @xmath3 , using equation  4 of @xcite .",
    "this rate is roughly 40% higher than the value derived from h@xmath19 measurements @xcite .",
    "we compute a total infrared luminosity of @xmath20 for the brightest compact source discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discrete ] using the formula discussed above after making an aperture correction of 2.5 ( computed using the psf model discussed in   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "this value depends on a large aperture correction , so we have compared it to the value obtained by assuming that the sed of the integrated galaxy is similar to that of the compact source ( measured at the native 24  resolution ) and that we can therefore scale the 24  emission to a tir luminosity .",
    "since this source contributes @xmath0% of the flux at 24  , the integrated luminosity implied by taking this same fraction of @xmath21 is @xmath22 , similar to the value derived above .",
    "this large luminosity is similar in scale to the nuclear star formation regions in m  33 and the galactic center discussed by @xcite , and we suggest that the nuclear source in ngc  55 is similarly powered by star formation . the high infrared and h@xmath19 luminosity ( @xmath23  erg  s@xmath24 @xcite ) of the central source can be plausibly attributed to star formation if we are observing a very young burst : the output is similar to a starburst99 @xcite model ( @xmath25 ) at an age of 2  myr .",
    "the star formation scenario for the central source is also consistent with mid - infrared spectroscopic @xcite , radio @xcite , and x - ray @xcite observations of this galaxy .",
    "we have used the 70 and 160  images to characterize the dust temperature in ngc  55 .",
    "we fit a blackbody modified by a @xmath15 emissivity function to each pixel and assigned a temperature to that pixel based on the temperature of the best fit . in reality , multiple dust temperature components are expected to contribute to the far - infrared emission @xcite , but this approach allows us to characterize variations across the disk of the galaxy . the result is shown in figure  [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "the mean temperature of this map ( 22.6  k ) is similar to the value of 22  k computed by @xcite from the central area covered by the single iso 60 and 100  pointing .",
    "the temperatures range from 20 to 26  k and correlate well with the fir surface brightness , with the exception of a few streaks in the temperature map which correspond to artifacts in the 70 and 160  images .",
    "the highest dust temperatures in figure  [ fig : temperature ] correspond to peaks in the 24  emission and are likely regions ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the lowest temperatures correspond to diffuse regions with little star formation .",
    "we have presented observations of the galaxy ngc  55 at 24 , 70 , and 160  made with the mips instrument aboard the _ spitzer space telescope . _",
    "the data provide images at unprecedented sensitivity and resolution at these wavelengths .",
    "the data demonstrate that the brightest region at fir wavelengths is faint at optical wavelengths and has a projected separation from the optical peak of nearly 520  pc .",
    "the fir peak is barely resolved in the 6  24  beam but still accounts for @xmath0% of the total flux at that wavelength .",
    "comparison of the infrared luminosity of this source and h@xmath19 measurements from the literature to a starburst model suggest that the current episode of star formation could be as young as 2  myr .",
    "the tir luminosity of the galaxy measured in several ways is @xmath2 , implying a star formation rate of @xmath3 .",
    "10% of the infrared luminosity is due to the compact nuclear source , which is of comparable luminosity to the bright star formation regions at the center of m  33 and the milky way . the integrated flux of this source and the other compact sources in the galaxy accounts for more than @xmath1 of the 24  emission from ngc  55 .",
    "a dust temperature map shows that the temperature ranges from 20  k in the low - surface - brightness region se of the nucleus to 26  k in the nucleus and other star - formation regions in the disk .",
