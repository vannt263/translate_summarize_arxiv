    "the general conjecture is that gravitational collapse of massive stars ( @xmath0 ) after a type ii supernova leads to neutron stars .",
    "@xcite these dense compact stars have been an object of various physical speculations due to possible extreme conditions of density and pressure at the core of the star .",
    "in fact , the physical nature of the interior of neutron star is still a point of debate among the researchers . in spite of the availabilty of plenty of observational data ,",
    "the problem is hardly resolved .",
    "the extreme conditions of pressure and density inside the neutron star may lead to the phase transition of neutrons to hyperons , bosons , free quark matter or strange quark matter .",
    "cameron @xcitepredicted that hyperons must be produced inside the neutron star . at high densities",
    "some of the nucleons may be converted to hyperons due to weak interaction as that is energetically more favourable .",
    "however , quark matter may also be present in the interior of the neutron star . due to extreme asymptotic momentum transfer and density at the core of the neutron star ,",
    "quarks become free of interaction .",
    "quarks inside the individual nucleons forms a colourless matter known as quark matter .",
    "@xcite heiselberg , pethick and staubo@xcite proved , in their paper , that the lowest energy state of matter with high density is constituted of quark matter in coexistence with nuclear matter . from this consideration",
    "they predicted that in the interior of neutron star finite fraction of constituent matter might be converted into quark matter .",
    "it is generally believed that conversion of baryonic matter into quark matter inside the neutron star would result into transient events like neutrino or gamma ray burst @xcite .",
    "however , it is always difficult to discriminate between a hybrid star and a neutron star through observation .",
    "recently , alford et al . @xcite have conformed that hybrid stars can pretend like neutron stars because they have very similar mass - radius rlationship .",
    "recent observation of the binary millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite predicted the mass of the neutron star to be @xmath1 which was the highest ever mass measured for a neutron star . another significant paper by antoniadis et al @xcite have reported after careful calculations that the mass of the pulsar @xmath2 is @xmath3 .",
    "these observations rule out the possibility of existence of hyperons or bosons inside the neutron star because the highest mass of the neutron star predicted by the models with the consideration of hyperons or bosons are much smaller than the observed value .",
    "various studies @xcite have reported that stiffer equation of state is to be considered for the nucleonic matter , as well as quark matter to achieve the obserbed maximum mass limit of the neutron stars which are believed to be hybrid stars due to their mass .",
    "there are numerous proposed models for hybrid star @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we propose a relativistic model of hybrid star with strange quark matter obeying the mit bag model equation of state along with normal baryonic matter . in cosmological modeling",
    "interacting two fluid model has been extensively used @xcite . in their paper ,",
    "f. rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite modelled galactic dark matter halo using interacting bryonic matter and quark matter .",
    "we have defined an interaction between the two types of matter inside the hybrid star through interaction equations obtained from the conservation equation .",
    "we have explored the physical nature of repulsive and attractive interaction between the two types of matter , and the case of no interaction as well .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the second section we describe the proposed model .",
    "section @xmath4 persents the results of the equations of the previous section for two different equations of state of the baryonic matter .",
    "section @xmath5 elaborates various aspects of the results and their physical significance . in section",

    "the study of inheritance symmetry is very useful in searching the natural relation between geometry and matter through the einstein equations .",
    "the well known inheritance symmetry is the symmetry under conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) .",
    "the conformal killing equation for ( [ metric ] ) becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lie derivative operator and @xmath16 is the conformal factor . here",
    "vector @xmath17 generates the conformal symmetry and then the metric @xmath18 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath17 .",
    "it may be noted that neither @xmath17 nor @xmath16 need to be static even though one considers a static metric  @xcite .",
    "the interesting point is that due to this and several other properties ckvs provide a deeper insight into the space - time geometry connected to astrophysical and cosmological realm .",
    "the above equations give the following equations as @xmath19 integration of eqs .",

    "it is interesting to note that the solution of @xmath23 in equation ( [ ck1 ] ) resembles the assumption ( @xmath24)taken by tolman @xcite in the solution @xmath25 of einstein s equation . making use of eqs .",

    "unless one knows the exact form of @xmath30 , one could not say anything .",
    "the hybrid star is constituted of quark matter at the core within an envelope of normal baryonic matter .",
    "we assume an interaction between these two states of matter inside the star .",
    "as we have assumed pressure isotropy inside the star , the conservation equation becomes @xmath31 the equations of state of nuclear matter , as well as the quark matter at low temperature and extremely high density that is relevant to the compact stars , are yet to be confirmed even from the theoretical consideration of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "we have explored two possible equations of state for the normal baryonic matter . in the first case equation of state of the baryonic matter",
    "is taken to be @xmath32 and in the second case the equation of state is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the equation of state parameter and @xmath35 is another parameter taking values in the range @xmath36 .",
    "the mit bag model is very successful in explaining the observations in particle physics .",
    "it is simple , but the researchers have been using it for last three decades to describe the quark matter inside a hybrid star .",
    "following mit bag equation of state , we have chosen the equation of state for the quark matter as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bag constant being expressed in units of @xmath39 . in literature we get the value of b in the range @xmath40 .",

    "chamel et al .",
    "@xcite in their study have used the values of effective bag constant to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath39 for the nucleonic equations of state bsk19 , bsk20 and bsk21 . in the present study",
    "we take @xmath45 @xmath39 which in geometric units becomes @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "from equations ( [ cfe2 ] ) and ( [ cfe3 ] ) we get the solutions of @xmath16 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the constant of integration .",

    "for @xmath68 , the expresion for @xmath12 in equation ( [ roq1 ] ) boils down to @xmath95 the first term in this expression is positive as @xmath54 .",
    "however , the second term is negative .",
    "so , the energy of the quark matter within the star appears to decrease with increasing @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting that similar observation was pointed out by p.k.panda et al @xcite in their paper .",
    "similarly , for case @xmath96 , the equation ( [ roq2 ] ) reduces to the form @xmath97 the role of the bag constant is similar to the previous case .",
    "however , the term @xmath98 provides the opposite effect .",
    "the radius of the star can be found out from the condition @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the radius of the star .",
    "the effective pressure for the first case is @xmath101 for the afore mentioned condition the equation ( [ pe1 ] ) gives @xmath102 for the second case , the @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 the condition @xmath99 gives the expression of radius same as the equation ( [ radius ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the solution for the radius sets a constraint for the constant @xmath49 . since @xmath105 can not be negative , from ( [ radius ] ) we get @xmath54 .",
    "this is in consistence with the equation ( [ motion ] ) .",
    "the mass function of the star is given by @xmath106 for @xmath107 ( [ m ] ) reduces to @xmath108 substituting @xmath100 from ( [ radius ] ) one can easily get @xmath109 from ( [ radius ] ) and ( [ ms2 ] ) it can be verified that @xmath110 this value of @xmath111 nicely satisfies the buchdahl s condition for mass radius relationship of a star @xcite .    in the equation ( [ psi ] ) if we substitute @xmath107 and the value of @xmath100 from equation ( [ radius ] ) we immediately get @xmath112 the value of @xmath16 from this equation comes out to be positive .",
    "thus one can note that conformal symmetry holds at the boundary of the star as well .    if we solve for @xmath100 , in the above equation ( [ m ] ) with the substitution of @xmath107 , where @xmath100 be the radius of the star , we get    @xmath113    the plot for @xmath100 from equation ( [ r ] ) is in fig([r_fig ] ) .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     [ six ]",
    "so , in the present paper we investigate some intricate theoretical questions regarding the physical nature of the hybrid star .",
    "the first question is whether the space time of a hybrid star admits conformal symmetry . from our analysis",
    "it is evident that the answer is yes . since conformal motion points to some intrisic symmetry of the space time , we think that the present study would be interesting for further exploration of the nature of the symmetry . another important problem that we have tried to explore is the nature of interaction between the quark matter and the nucleonic matter inside the hybrid star .",
    "however , we did not approach the problem from the point of view of particle physics . from general relativistic considerations and taking both types matter as fluids",
    ", we set up interaction equations for the two fluids .",
    "the results of the present model fit best with the observational data for @xmath114 , which implies a repulsive interaction between the quark matter and the nucleonic matter . from the plots ( [ comparison1 ] ) and ( [ comparison2 ] )",
    ", one can clearly find that the repulsive interaction becomes more and more conspicuous for higher masses .",
    "it may be noted that from particle physics also it is predicted that at high densities the mutual repulsions between the nucleonic particles would be dominant .",
    "steinheimer & schramm @xcite strongly proposed the existence of repulsive interactions between the deconfined quarks as well as hadrons .",
    "hell & weise @xcite in a recent paper pointed out that hybrid matter without the consideration of some strongly repulsive interaction like vector current interaction between quarks , would be very soft .",
    "we also get similar finding in the present paper .",
    "several models with different predictions are there in the literature to describe cold and dense interacting nuclear matter .",
    "walecka model is one of the most popular models for modeling nuclear matter at high densities .",
    "calculations based on this model show that at high densities for nucleonic matter @xmath115",
    ". thus , @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "in the present model , we have obtained @xmath68 for equation of state of the normal baryonic matter .",
    "therefore , from our model also we get @xmath117 which is in concurrence with the prediction of walecka model .",
    "a. chodos et al.@xcite proposed a strongly interacting particle as a finite region of space where the fields are confined . in their paper",
    "they conjectured bag constant as a finite region having a constant energy per unit volume .",
    "thus this constant must contribute to energy momentum tensor of the star .",
    "this in turn infuences the geometry of the space time . in the present model we have got a relation between the bag constant and the geometry of the space time of the hybrid star through the three relations which we have obtained from the interaction equations for both cases of the equations of state .",
    "since bag constant is a constant measurable in terrestrial laboratories , we used the measured value of @xmath38 to find out the possible nature of the space time geometry through the constant @xmath105 which is the constant of proportionality between @xmath118 and @xmath16 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we have obtained the values of mass and radius of the hybrid star in equations ( [ radius ] ) and ( [ ms2 ] ) from theoretical calculations .",
    "it is intersting to note that the values of the mass and radius satisfies the buchdahl s condition .",
    "this is a very strong support for our model .",
    "moreover , the value of mass calculated from the mass function , obtained from the theory closely match the mass obtained by alford et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath114 .",
    "however , in the present model we have not taken into account the particle nature of quarks and baryons and considered both as two different fluids inside the hybrid star . the study may be extended considering more realistic equations of state obtained from qcd simulations .",
