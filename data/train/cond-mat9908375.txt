    "the magnetophonon resonance ( mpr ) effect occurs when two landau levels are a phonon energy apart which leads to a resonant scattering due to emission or absorption of phonons . since the pioneering work by gurevich and firsov [ 1 ]",
    ", this effect has been extensively studied in bulk [ 2 - 4 ] as well as low - dimensional semiconductor systems.[5 - 10 ] the resonant character makes it a powerful spectroscopic tool .",
    "magnetophonon resonances have been used to obtain information on band structure parameters , such as the effective mass and the energy levels , and on the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the vast majority of work on mpr was done on the transport properties of semiconductors , usually the magnetoresistance , which inevitably involves a complicated averaging of scattering processes .",
    "the oscillations in the magnetoresistance are the results of a combination of scattering and broadening processes which can lead to a quite complicated dependence of the resonance amplitudes on doping , sample structure , carrier concentration , and temperature .",
    "however , the mpr can also be observed directly through a study of the electron cyclotron resonance ( cr ) linewidth and effective mass , i.e. , the so called optically detected mpr ( odmpr ) .",
    "this was demonstrated by barnes _",
    "[ 11 ] for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor system formed in gaas / algaas heterojunctions .",
    "the odmpr allows one to make quantitative measurements of the scattering strength for specific landau levels and yields direct information on the nature of the electron - phonon interaction in semiconductors .    in this work",
    ", we extend the theory for odmpr to three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems and present the first theoretical study of the magnetophonon resonances in the frequency - dependent conductivity in bulk polar semiconductors .",
    "our calculations show strong oscillations of both the linewidth and the effective mass in a 3d system of gaas which indicate that the odmpr should also be observed experimentally in bulk polar semiconductors .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii ,  we present our theoretical formulation of the problem .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "iii , and we summerize our results in sec .",
    "magnetophonon resonance is essentially a single - particle effect and , consequently , can be treated as a one - polaron problem .",
    "we consider a polar semiconductor in a uniform magnetic field * b * directed along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "the system under consideration can be described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bare electron effective mass , the vector potential @xmath7 is choosen in the symmetrical coulomb gauge , @xmath8   ( @xmath9 ) the momentum ( position ) operator of the electron , @xmath10 @xmath11 the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an optical - phonon with wave vector @xmath8 and energy @xmath12 .",

    "first , we calculate the optical aborption spectrum of the polaron in the presence of a magnetic field from which we are able to investigate the polaron cr spectrum and the corresponding mpr effects . for convenience",
    "we use units such that @xmath17 within linear response theory the frequency - dependent magneto - optical absorption spectrum for cyclotron resonance [ 12 - 14 ] is given by @xmath18^{2}+[{\\rm im}\\sigma ( z)]^{2 } } } ,   \\label{absorption}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the unperturbed electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath20 is the so called memory function , and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a broadening parameter .",

    "in this section , we present our numerical results on the magneto - optical aborption spectra and study the magnetophonon resonant effects . as an example , we apply our theory to the semiconductor gaas where @xmath48 .",

    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively , as a function of frequency at three different magnetic fields .",
    "we see that , at @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ... ) , re@xmath52 exhibits a jump while im@xmath53 diverges logarithmically .",
    "the discontinuity of re@xmath52 and the divergency in im@xmath54 reflects the resonant coupling between the state @xmath55 and landau level @xmath56 the stronger this coupling , the larger the discontinuity in re@xmath52 .",
    "actually , the real part of the memory function re@xmath52 is responsible for the shift in the observed cr energy which is due to the electron - phonon interaction . while , the imaginary part leads to a broadening of the spectrum which is a result of scattering .",
    "when im@xmath57 like in a 2d system , the absorption is a @xmath58 function and its position is determined by the equation @xmath59 .",
    "1(b ) shows that for a bulk system im@xmath52 is non zero which reflects the 3d character of the electron states . the scattering which is mainly in the direction parallel to the magnetic field results in a finite im@xmath52 and consequently a finite linewidth even for @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we show the corresponding magneto - optical absorption spectra .",
    "the position of the aborption peaks corresponds to the cyclotron resonance frequency @xmath61 at which the cyclotron resonance occurs .",
    "we notice an asymmetric double peak structure around @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( the solid curve ) and the absorption becomes zero at @xmath64 the zeros in the absorption spectrum are a consequence of the divergences in im@xmath54 and which can be traced back to the divergent nature of the density of states .",
    "the double peak structure is a consequence of the magnetophonon resonance which leads to an anticrossing behavior in the cr spectrum .",
    "when the cr frequency @xmath65 deviates from @xmath66 this splitting becomes very weak and difficult to observe in the aborption spectrum . as we will see below , however",
    ", the magnetophonon resonance will strongly affect the linewidth of the magneto - optical aborption and the cr mass . from the dash and the dotted curves",
    ", we notice that the absorption peak appears at a frequency @xmath67 due to the polaron effect which shifts the cyclotron frequency to lower frequencies . the latter is often interpreted as an increase of the cyclotron mass , i.e. @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the absorption spectrum around ( a ) @xmath69 and ( b ) @xmath70 .",
    "the double peak structure disappears when @xmath71 deviates from @xmath72 .",
    "the aborption spectra also demonstrate clearly a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the peak position and linewidth around @xmath73     fig .",
    "3 demonstrates the effect of the broadening parameter @xmath74 on the absorption spectrum .",
    "notice that , with increasing @xmath22 : i ) the double peak structure disappears for @xmath75 , ii ) the zero in the absorption spectrum disappears when @xmath76 , and iii ) the position of the absorption peak shifts to higher frequency .",
    "this indicates that the anticrossing behavior in the cr spectrum will be difficult to be observed experimently at @xmath63 due to broadening effects which are a consequence of scattering on e.g. impurities and acoustical phonons .",
    "as soon as the polaron cr frequency @xmath61 is determined from the postion of the magneto - optical absorption peak , the cr mass of the polaron is obtained by @xmath77 the numerical results of the polaron cr mass and the fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) for @xmath78 are plotted as a function of the unperturbed cr frequency at different temperatures in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , respectively .",
    "one observes that the polaron cr mass is an oscillating function of the magnetic field .",
    "4(b ) shows that the fwhm of the polaron magneto - optical absorpion spectrum reaches a local maximum at @xmath79 where the polaron mass has an inflection point .",
    "this result demonstrates the derivative - like relation between the polaron cr mass and the linewidth which are due to the fact that the real and imaginary part of the memory function are related to each other through a kramers - kronig relation .",
    "one finds that , for temperature @xmath80 k , the resonance grows rapidly with increasing @xmath81 .",
    "this effect can lead to a direct measurement of the optical - phonon scattering rate .",
    "we notice also an overall increase of the linewidth with temperature , but an overall decrease of the effective mass when @xmath82 k. the resonant position is slightly larger than the non - interacting resonant condition @xmath83 and is almost independent of temperature .",
    "a detailed analysis indicates that , at @xmath84 and @xmath85 the peak position both in the fwhm and in the derivative of the cr mass is at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "experimentally this position determines the so called fundamental field @xmath88 which is an important quantity to study the effective mass , nonparabolicity of the energy band , as well as the lo - phonon frequency .",
    "the linewidth is a direct measure of the lifetime of the state .",
    "notice that the conventional mpr occurs in the resistivity , which is given by @xmath89 im@xmath90 .",
    "but odmpr is related to both the real and imaginary part of the memory function which occurs for @xmath91 and is a dynamical mpr .",
    "5 shows the cr mass oscillation amplitude at @xmath92 and @xmath93 as a function of temperature . with increasing temperature , the number of phonons increases and consequently , the oscillation amplitude increases . on",
    "the other hand , the background electron - phonon scattering ( coupling ) increases which results in a suppression of the oscillation amplitude .",
    "6 shows an activation plot of the amplitude of the resonant peak in the fwhm at @xmath92 and @xmath93 as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "we find that , for the resonance around @xmath84 , the linewidth can be described rather well by the exponential law @xmath95 for @xmath96 k , while that around @xmath97 can be described by @xmath98 for @xmath99 k. this exponential behavior can be understood as follows .",
    "mpr is proportional to the number of lo - phonons which are present and therefore should increase as @xmath100 . on the other hand , thermal broadening of the landau levels , which is proportional to @xmath101 , will diminish the resonant structure in @xmath102 .",
    "thus this contribution decreases the resonant character and consequently we expect that @xmath103 which agrees with the exponential laws found for @xmath84 and @xmath97 .",
    "we have extended the theory for odmpr to three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems and present the first detailed theoretical study of the magnetophonon resonance in the frequency - dependent conductivity of electrons in bulk gaas . in comparison to the corresponding 2d systems ,",
    "the theoretical obtained amplitudes for the oscillations of both the linewidth and the effective mass in a 3d system are for gaas predicted to be about half of those in 2d .",
    "therefore , we believe that odmpr can also be observed experimentally in bulk polar semiconductors . out",
    "numerical results indicate that the amplitude of the resonant peak in the fwhm can be described by an exponential law for not too large temperatures .",
