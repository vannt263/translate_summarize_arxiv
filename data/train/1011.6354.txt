    ", they have bosonic spacetime physics , although they have worldsheet fermions , and may be thought of as two  dimensional supergravity coupled to @xmath6 superconformal minimal models , with a diagonal gso projection .",

    "linear ordinary differential equations , known as the string equations .",
    "they furnish asymptotic expansions for the free energy once the boundary conditions are fixed .",
    "these expansions take the form of a string world  sheet expansion .",
    "typically ( for the cases of the type  0a and  0b systems coupled to the @xmath7 superconformal minimal models ) there are two perturbative regimes in which such an expansion can be developed .",
    "one is interpreted as purely closed string backgrounds with integer , @xmath8 , units of r  r flux , while the other has both open and closed string sectors with @xmath8 d  branes in the background d  branes or flux units correspond to special soliton solutions , as shown in refs .",

    "@xcite in the context of the type  0a systems ) that connects these two asymptotic regimes , furnishing an example of a so  called `` geometric transition '' between open and closed string backgrounds .",
    "while in the case of type  0a , complete ( numerical ) solutions of the exact string equations for any @xmath8 can be found , the connectedness of the type  0b case has been argued for on the basis of a large @xmath8 , t hooft  like , limit where the interpolating solution can be found using algebraic techniques@xcite .",

    "these string equations turn out to be a painlev  iv hierarchy of equations .",
    "we found that both the type  0a and  0b string theories were found to be naturally embedded within this framework .",
    "in addition to this new non  perturbative connection , we found further that the two string theories are merely special points in a much larger tapestry of possibilities that also appear to be string theories .",
    "this is somewhat suggestive of an m  theory , now for minimal strings , which is exactly solvable .",
    "it clearly deserves further study .    among the other special points which suggested themselves ( using perturbation theory )",

    "we argue that the conjectured type  ii theories have non  perturbative completions by showing that the corresponding perturbative expansions match onto each other smoothly .",
    "this is accomplished using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques similar to those used for the type  0 theories coupled to the @xmath7 superconformal minimal models .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sections 2 and 3 , we review essential aspects of the well  known type  0 theories and provide a summary of results about the dww system that will be needed later .",

    "we then reformulate it in a manner that allows us to extend the technique to our dww system .",
    "we apply this strategy to our system in section 5 for the first two even dww flows , which contain the type  0 and conjectured type  ii theories of interest and find that the type  ii theories possess smooth non  perturbative solutions .",
    "in addition , we find evidence for the existence of new non  perturbative solutions with novel asymptotics . in section 6 , we consider the first ( and simplest ) flow of the dww system .",
    "for this case , we are able to strengthen evidence for the existence of these new non  perturbative solutions with exact numerical results .",
