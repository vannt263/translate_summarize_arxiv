    "in addition to numerous theoretical and experimental works on graphene and its nrs , research efforts have been also devoted to synthesize its various derivatives .",
    "notably , the synthesis of a 2d hydrocarbon in honeycomb structure,@xcite namely graphane , followed its prediction through theoretical works.@xcite detailed analysis of hydrogenation processes of graphene leading to graphane and the existence of hydrogen ( h ) frustrations were discussed very recently.@xcite furthermore , it was reported that graphane nrs have more favorable formation energies than experimentally available graphene ribbons .",
    "@xcite recently , we reported the possibility of obtaining magnetization through dehydrogenation of domains on 2d graphane.@xcite modification of electronic structure of graphane by introducing either a hydroxyl group or a h - vacancy was also investigated with gw self - energy calculations .",
    "@xcite although there are several recent studies on graphane , electrical and magnetic properties of its nrs have remained unexplored .",
    "recent advances in graphane have motivated us to explore the properties of zigzag and armchair graphane nrs . in this paper , using first - principles plane wave method within the density functional theory ( dft ) we investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of bare and h- passivated graphane nrs .",
    "we also explored the effects of specific imperfections on these properties .",

    "reciprocal space integrations are carried out with 1x1x15 monkhorst - pack * k*-point grids .",
    "for a better understanding of graphane nrs we start with 2d graphane which is derived from the hydrogenation of graphene , where each carbon atom is saturated by a single hydrogen atom .",
    "accordingly , the primitive cell of graphane consists of two carbon and two hydrogen atoms .",
    "chair like configuration of infinite sheet of 2d graphane is formed , whereby each carbon atoms of a- and b - type sublattices are saturated by hydrogen atoms from above and below , respectively , as described in fig .",
    "[ 2d - graphane](a ) .",
    "this is known as the most favorable and stable hydrocarbon conformation.@xcite the planar graphene honeycomb structure , which is stabilized by planar @xmath7-hybrid orbitals and @xmath8-bonding between adjacent perpendicular @xmath9-orbitals is puckered ( buckled ) as a result of the adsorption of h atoms , whereby a single c atom is bound to three adjacent c atoms and a single h atom through tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath10-like hybrid orbitals .",
    "the buckling , @xmath11 , i.e. the perpendicular distance between a - type and b - type carbon sublattices , is calculated to be 0.45  . as a result ,",
    "the lattice constant of graphene increases from 2.46     to 2.51     and hence the c - c and c - h bond lengths become 1.52 and 1.12   , respectively , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ 2d - graphane](a ) .",
    "the charge density contour plots given in fig .",
    "[ 2d - graphane](b ) indicate that the charge distribution in graphane especially around the c - c bond is reminiscent of that in tetrahedrally coordinated diamond . in graphane ,",

    "the maximum of the c - c bond charge in diamond and in graphane are found to be @xmath14 and @xmath15 e / @xmath2 , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we found that some atoms , such as c , o , v and pt that are adsorbed on the h - passivated armchair graphane nr surface show a tendency to remove h atoms from graphane surface .",
    "since the single atoms of c , o , v and pt have rather high binding energy , it seems possible to create graphene domains on graphane by striping h atoms but covering the domain by adsorbed atoms .",
    "independent of their initial position , c and o atoms are adsorbed to carbon atoms of graphane by replacing h atoms .",
    "a typical binding configuration of c and o is indicated as m1 in fig .",
    "[ adatom ] .",
    "adsorption of c and o atoms occur at the middle of nanoribbon with strong binding energies of 5.89 and 3.99 ev , respectively .",
    "the resulting system is nm .",
    "binding structures of pt and v , which also remove h atom from the host c atom of graphane , are also shown in the same figure .",
    "although h has very low binding energy ( and hence is not shown in table  [ tab : adsorp ] ) , it may be important for striping h atoms from graphane . upon all geometry relaxations from different initial conditions",
    ", single adsorbed h atom prefers to bind on top of h atom of graphane and forms h@xmath16 molecule which is weakly bound to the nearest c atom .",
    "the binding energy of h@xmath16 molecule is calculated to be @xmath17 mev .",
    "in our recent study@xcite , we showed that a graphane , which has a nm ground state , can be made magnetic simply by removing hydrogen atoms from the uniform hydrogen layers adsorbed on its both sides .",
    "it was found that the magnetization depends on whether the defect region is one - sided or two - sided .",
    "it was also shown that in certain circumstances remarkably large magnetic moments can be attained in a small domain on the sheet of graphane .",
    "experimentally , removal of surface hydrogen atoms by using laser beam resonating with surface - atom bond@xcite , ionic vapor application@xcite and subnanometer pt clusters@xcite are reported before . since it is revealed that the double - sided vacancies give higher magnetic moments we focus on these type of vacancies on the nanoribbons .    in this section",
    "we consider six different types of vacancies in a bare armchair graphane nr with @xmath18=15 .",
    "upon desorption of a single hydrogen atom , as shown in fig",
    ".  [ vacancy ] , local bonding through @xmath10-hybrid orbital is retransformed into planar @xmath19- and perpendicular @xmath20-orbitals . at the vacancy site one",
    "electron accommodated by the dangling @xmath20-orbital becomes unpaired and hence contributes to the magnetization by 1 @xmath21 .",
    "we also calculated that a single h - vacancy located at the center of the nr has 70 mev lower energy than that located near the edge of the ribbon .",
    "the situation is rather intriguing for the magnetization of large domains of hydrogen vacancies .",
    "as in the case of single h - vacancy , leading to transformation of @xmath10-bonding into planar @xmath19-bonding , triangular @xmath22 , and rectangular @xmath23 shaped large graphene islands can be created by removing h atoms hence by creating h - vacancy domains . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vacancy ] , hydrogen desorbed triangle - shaped island consisting of @xmath24 carbon atom at its each edge is defined as @xmath22n - type h - vacancy .",
    "therefore , a @xmath22n - type vacancy domain can be obtained by removing @xmath25 h atom from top side and @xmath26 h atom from down side of the graphane nanoribbon .",
    "this means that @xmath25 @xmath20-orbital electrons freed from a - type and @xmath26 @xmath20-orbital electrons freed from b - type sublattice c atoms .",
    "according to the lieb s theorem @xcite net magnetic moment of such a system can be calculated from the difference between the sublattice atoms . for triangle vacancies",
    "this difference is simply equal to @xmath24 and thus the @xmath22n - vacancy domain has net magnetic moment with @xmath27 .",
    "however , the @xmath23-type domains does not yield large magnetic moments and have values between 0 and 2 @xmath21 .",
    "it is seen that magnetic interactions in double - sided triangular and square h - vacancy domains resulting in net magnetic moments are relatively straightforward and are in good agreement with lieb s theorem .",
    "we also consider ch- and c@xmath28h@xmath28-vacancies , the synthesis of them are relatively easier than creating only h - vacancies . in our study , these vacancies are first created in a nr by removing involved atoms and subsequently their structures are optimized .",
    "calculated values of magnetic moments of the structure are presented in fig .",
    "[ vacancy ] .",
    "after the creation of a ch - vacancy on a graphane nanoribbon , geometric structure rearranges itself via jahn - teller - like distortion in the lattice .",

    "[ vacancy ] shows the unpaired up and down spin electron states located on the region surrounding the vacancy .",
    "it is seen that a bare armchair graphane nr , which is nm semiconductor when it is defect free , attains permanent magnetic moment in the presence of ch - vacancies .",
    "while ch - type vacancy makes small changes in the geometric structure , stone - wales type deformation occurs after formation of the c@xmath28h@xmath28-vacancy .",
    "since electrons are paired in c@xmath28h@xmath28-vacancy , the ground state is again nm and thus there is no visible difference charge density in fig .",
    "[ vacancy ] . from the point view of lieb s theorem ,",
    "removal of a ch couple results in an absence in the number of @xmath20-orbital electron belonging to a a - type ( or b - type ) sublattice . upon the creation of c@xmath28h@xmath28-vacancy ,",
    "both the a- and b - type sublattices lose one electron and thus the difference is zero resulting in a nm ground state .",
    "our results are consistent with the recently reported values for ch - vacancies in infinite sheets of graphane.@xcite    2 and @xmath223 , double - sided rectangular shaped @xmath232 , ch and c@xmath28h@xmath28 vacancies and resulting difference charge density , @xmath29 , surfaces for a bare armchair graphane",
    "large / black and small / light blue - gray balls indicate c and h atoms , respectively .",
    "only a small part which includes vacancy region and its nearby atoms , of the armchair graphane nr with @xmath18=15 is shown.,width=321 ]",
    "earlier , it was shown that the edge roughness of graphene nrs can affect their electronic@xcite and mechanical@xcite properties . in particular , it was revealed that periodically repeating edge profiles can be treated within the superlattice structure , which result in confinement of spin states in zigzag nrs.@xcite band alignments of these superlattice structures have been studied both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite here we investigated the effect of periodically repeating edge roughness of a bare zigzag graphane nr . while one edge of nr is kept flat , periodically repeating undulations are carved at the other edge .",
    "the same structure can be viewed as periodically repeating heterostructures of wide ( @xmath18=8 ) and narrow ( @xmath18=6 ) segments of zigzag graphane nrs .",
    "atomic and electronic band structure of this superlattice , which mimics the edge roughness are shown in fig .",
    "[ roughness ] .",
    "here we note that infinite bare zigzag graphane nr with @xmath18=8 has a band gap of 0.8 ev , while the band gap of infinite bare zigzag graphane nr with @xmath18=6 is relatively wider and 0.9 ev . as pointed out in sec .",
    "iv , wide band gap of h - passivated graphane nrs is reduced to 0.8 - 0.9 ev because of edge states of unpassivated dangling bonds of bare graphane nrs , which appear in the band gap .",
    "these edge states in fig .",
    "[ roughness ] of the superlattice occur as several closely lying flat bands below and above the fermi level separated by a superlattice band gap of @xmath300.8 ev .",

    "charge density isosurfaces of the highest filled spin up and spin down edge state indicate the localization at the flat edge . as for the charge distribution of the lower lying valence states",
    "is rather uniform along the narrow region .",
    "the states of the flat band at the edge of the conduction band is confined in the wide segment of the superlattice since they can not find a matching state in the narrow region . as a proof of the concept",

    "research on recently synthesized graphane revealed interesting electronic and magnetic properties of this two dimensional honeycomb structure .",
    "graphane attains a @xmath31-like bonding through covering of its both sides by hydrogen atom .",
    "this bonding is rather different from the @xmath7-bonding of graphene and attributes a number of additional properties to graphane .",
    "for example , in contrast to semimetallic graphene with linear band crossing at the fermi level , graphane is a nonmagnetic , wide band semiconductor .",
    "the armchair and zigzag graphane nrs of graphane display important number of properties and hence constitute basic structures to fabricate various devices .",
    "both zigzag and armchair graphane nrs are wide band gap semiconductor when their edges are passivated with hydrogen .",
    "the band gaps vary exponentially with their widths . for narrow graphane nrs",
    "the band gap is large due to quantum confinement effect , but approaches to the band gap of graphane as the width increases .",
    "unpaired , unpassivated dangling bonds at the edges have 1 bohr magneton magnetic moment and have antiferromagnetic coupling with adjacent dangling bonds .",
    "these graphane nrs can be functionalized to attain additional properties through h - passivation of their edges , adatom adsorption , vacancy creation , edge profiling and superlattice formation . in particular ,",
    "graphane nrs attain magnetic moment through the creation of h vacancy at the surfaces of graphane .",
    "this property can be utilized to achieve interesting functionalities through decoration and patterning of h - vacancies on the graphane nrs .",
    "the possibility of generation of large magnetic moments at small domains of h - vacancies makes graphane based structures promising for data storage and nanospintronic applications .",
    "these functionalities can be further extended by adsorbing adatoms to carbon atoms deprived from hydrogen .",
