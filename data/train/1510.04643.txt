    "these studies have frequently taken the form of a detailed analysis for individual events , e.g. , sn 1987a ( 87a ) , or surveys for stars of just a few different masses . in some cases where broader surveys were done ,",
    "the nucleosynthesis was calculated separately from any consideration of the explosion physics , and the central engine was linked in as a parametrized inner boundary condition for a calculation that included only the matter outside of the collapsing core .",
    "the explosion was parametrized either by dumping a prescribed amount of energy into inner zones , or by the motion of a piston , generally constrained to give a fixed value of kinetic energy for the final supernova .",
    "sometimes this energy was varied over a limited range and the sensitivity of outcomes determined .    here",
    "we report the results of a different approach .",
    "the starting point is an ensemble of 200 presupernova models that together span the range of masses expected for common supernovae ( 9.0 - 120 @xmath0 ) . for the most part ,",
    "these models or very similar ones have been published before @xcite .",
    "all have solar metallicity .",
    "each was calculated using the kepler code and identical stellar physics .",
    "the major innovation here is the treatment of the explosion mechanism .",
    "two sorts of calculations of the explosion are carried out for each mass . iron - core collapse and bounce , neutrino transport , and the propagation of the outgoing shock",
    "are followed in one simulation until sufficiently late that the final mass cut and explosion energy have been well determined .",
    "this calculation , which includes a high density equation of state and neutrino transport that captures the essential effects of neutrinos , also gives an estimate of nucleosynthesis , especially for @xmath2ni .",
    "the second calculation tracks the results of the first in a study of detailed nucleosynthesis and radiation transport that gives the bolometric light curve .",
    "a consistent mapping between the two codes gives , for each presupernova star , very nearly the same remnant mass , kinetic energy at infinity , and @xmath2ni mass .",
    "nucleosynthesis is calculated for all isotopes from hydrogen through lead , except that the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino wind is not included .",
    "both calculations are one - dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "while the actual physics of neutrino - powered supernovae can not be fully represented in a such a limited study @xcite , multi - dimensional models are expensive , scarce , and often lack community consensus . of necessity",
    ", an expedient track is adopted that should capture many characteristics of a real explosion .",
    "the 1d core - collapse code is used to calculate the explosion of five different progenitors for sn 1987a @xcite and one progenitor for sn 1054 ( the `` crab '' ;   [ sec : crab ] ) .",
    "adjustable parameters in the central engine model are varied to give the well - determined @xmath2ni mass , kinetic energy and neutrino burst time scale for sn 1987a , and the kinetic energy of the crab .",
    "based upon the systematics of presupernova core structure (   [ sec : calibrate ] ) , supernovae below 12.0 @xmath0  are deemed to be `` crab - like '' , while heavier stars are `` 87a - like '' .",
    "further partition of the mass space might be practical given more observational constraints , especially supernovae with well - determined masses , but was not attempted here .",
    "these central engines are then used to explore the outcomes when placed in the 200 presupernova stars .",
    "the use of these `` calibrated central engines '' , which are really just standardized descriptions of the inner 1.1 @xmath0  of the proto - neutron star , allows a calculation of the neutrino and accretion physics outside the inner core that depends sensitively upon the structure of individual presupernova stars . for some models ,",
    "the standard central engine is unable to provide enough energy for explosion and a black hole forms . for others ,",
    "the star explodes with a variable amount of kinetic energy . for the stars that do explode , the resulting patterns of supernova energetics , nucleosynthesis , remnant masses , and light curves are reasonable for four out of five of the calibrations for sn 1987a .",
    "one set of calculations that used a model for sn 1987a that exploded too easily , gave explosions that , on the average , were deemed too weak . in this case",
    "an inadequate number of stars exploded to make the abundances we see in the sun (   [ sec : explosions ] ) .",

    "for stars 13.0 @xmath0   and heavier , including the models for sn 1987a , the evolution up to core oxygen depletion was followed using a 19 isotope approximation network and , after central oxygen decreased to below 4% by mass , using a 128 isotope quasi - equilibrium network @xcite .",
    "those calculations were `` co - processed '' using an adaptive network @xcite that , near the end included , typically , 1500 isotopes and sometimes over 2000 .",
    "in addition to following the nucleosynthesis zone by zone and step by step , the evolution of the ( slowly evolving ) electron mole number , @xmath11 , calculated by the large network was fed back into the structure calculation .",
    "energy generation within an iterative loop , however , came from the 19 isotope network or the quasi - equilibrium network .    for stars lighter than 13 @xmath0 , the tracking of off - center burning and convectively bounded flames requires a more careful treatment of the nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "for these stars , the large network and all neutrino losses from weak reactions on individual nuclei , was coupled directly to the structure calculation .",

    "the key quantity for nucleosynthesis and remnant masses is the mass of the core of helium and heavy elements at the time of the explosion . to the extent",
    "that the salpeter imf properly reflects this distribution of helium core masses , our results would not be changed if a substantial fraction of the stars were in binary systems .",
    "if mass exchange proceeds so far as to appreciably reduce the mass of the helium core from what it would have been for a single star , including radiatively - driven mass loss , then the answer will change . for example , it seems most likely that common sn ib and ic result from binary systems containing stars whose presupernova mass is only 3 or 4 @xmath0   @xcite .",
    "many of these may come from 12 to 15 @xmath0   main sequence stars that lost their envelopes and little else to a companion .",
    "treating these as single stars does not greatly distort the nucleosynthetic outcome , though it obviously changes the rate of type ib and ic supernovae a lot .",
    "if the progenitors in binaries were much heavier , some of their nucleosynthesis , especially in the helium shell , might have been lost to a companion and it becomes an issue whether _ that _ star blows up returning what it accreted to the interstellar medium .",

    "it achieves the desired goals of making a blue supergiant progenitor , producing a relatively large mass of oxygen , and displaying large enhancements in surface helium and nitrogen abundances , by invoking reduced metallicity , restricted semiconvection , and a substantial amount of rotation .",

    "the detected neutrino signal from sn  1987a is used as a benchmark , but we also make sure that the neutrino - energy loss of our pns models is consistent with binding energies of neutron stars based on microphysical equations of state .",
    "excluding the high - density core of the pns from direct modelling can be justified by the still incomplete knowledge of the equation of state in the supernuclear regime and significant uncertainties in the neutrino opacities in dense , correlated nuclear matter , which overshadow all fully self - consistent modelling .",

    "the onset of the explosion differs between 2d and 3d with the former favouring earlier explosions because of differences in the behaviour of turbulence in the post - shock region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the imposed constraint of axisymmetry in 2d leads to artificial explosion geometries with pronounced axis features .",
    "also the long - time phase of simultaneous accretion and ejection of neutrino - heated matter seems to differ considerably between 2d and 3d @xcite , which can lead to more energetic explosions in 3d @xcite .    in the following , we present essential information on how the pns is described as neutrino source in our simulations and how the calibration of this neutrino source is done by referring to observational data .",
    "since results of nearly the same set of presupernova models using p - hotb have been recently discussed by @xcite , our description here can be terse and focused mainly on newly introduced aspects .",
    "the central 1.1 @xmath0  core of the pns resulting from the collapse of each presupernova star is excised from the computational volume and replaced by a contracting inner grid boundary a few milliseconds after core bounce , shortly after the expanding shock has converted to a stalled accretion shock at an enclosed mass of more than 1.1 @xmath0 . for the hydrodynamics",
    "we apply the conditions that are needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium at this lagrangian grid boundary @xcite .",
    "the shrinking of the cooling and deleptonizing pns is mimicked by the contraction of the inner grid boundary , @xmath47 , which is described by an exponential function ( eq .  1 in @xcite ) with the parameter values given in sect .  2 of @xcite .",
    "in order to avoid too severe time - step restrictions that could hamper the tracking of the combined evolution of pns and ejecta over more than 20s , we choose the case of `` standard '' instead of `` rapid '' contraction shown in fig .  1 of @xcite",
    "this may lead to an underestimation of the accretion luminosity and of the gradual hardening of the radiated neutrino spectra compared to self - consistent supernova simulations , but in our approach this can well be compensated by a corresponding adjustment of the calibration of the inner core as neutrino source . since the accretion luminosity computed by the transport adds to core luminosity imposed at the inner grid boundary , the calibration sets constraints to the combined value of these two contributions .    as detailed in @xcite",
    ", we describe the high - density pns core of mass @xmath48 by a simple one - zone model under the constraints of energy conservation and the virial theorem including the effects associated with the growing pressure of the accretion layer , whose accumulation around the pns core is followed by our hydrodynamic simulations .",

    "nevertheless , with a suitably chosen ( calibrated ) time dependence of @xmath70 , our model is able to reproduce basic features of the neutrino emission of cooling pnss , and the choice of @xmath69 and @xmath68 can be guided by the temporal behaviour of @xmath53 in sophisticated pns cooling calculations ( see below ) .    since both of the expressions of eqs .",

    "w20 is weak for other reasons .",
    "its values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are actually quite similar to those of n20 , which is a considerably stronger engine .",
    "the main reason for the different strengths of these two cases is the fact that we tuned the n20 parameters such that sn  1987a exploded with about 1.5b ( table [ tab : p - hotbparams ] ) , whereas for w20 we accepted a sn  1987a explosion energy of only 1.24b ( see table  1 in @xcite ) .",

    "one then has two options for simulating the explosion - dumping a prescribed amount of energy in one or several zones , or moving a specified inner boundary , a `` piston '' , along a specified trajectory , radius as a function of time .",

    "the thin gray lines are mass shells in steps of 0.004 @xmath0  resolving the neutrino - driven wind , which is defined as the difference between the proto - neutron star mass at the onset of the explosion and its mass after @xmath115s .",

    "experience showed that a piston situated too deep in the star accreted too much matter while waiting for neutrinos to reverse the accretion .",
    "the sudden outward motion of the large artificially accreted mass resulted in an overly powerful explosion and too much @xmath2ni production .",

    "they mark the first mass shell to be accelerated outwards when the stalled shock revives .",
    "several such trajectories were followed in kepler and gave reasonably good agreement , typically within 20% , with the results from p - hotb for both supernova energy and iron - group synthesis .",
    "better agreement could be obtained , however , if the significant stagnation at small radius for the `` special trajectory '' used by kepler was shortened .",

    "they also agreed to typically better than 10% in the mass of iron - group nuclei that were synthesized ( table [ tab : eni_z9.6 ] and table [ tab : eni_n20_w18 ] ) . here the total iron in p - hotb calculation is taken as the amount outside the final fallback mass .    to make the agreement in @xmath2ni mass even better , first , for few models the starting location in mass of the special trajectory , @xmath122 , was slightly varied , usually by @xmath124 @xmath0 ,",

    "models are one - dimensional , of a single metallicity - solar , and do not include any effects of rotation .",
    "nevertheless , they capture many essential aspects of a general solution neglected in past studies , including the explosion effects of a non - monotonic variation of the presupernova compactness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_all ] ) with mass .",
    "the explosions are calibrated to reproduce the characteristics of two well - studied supernovae : the crab and sn 1987a .",
    "the crab is believed to have been a low mass supernova , near 10 @xmath0 , with a low explosion energy , @xmath288 erg that made very little iron .",
    "sn 1987a was a star near 18 @xmath0  that exploded with @xmath334 erg and made 0.07 @xmath0  of @xmath2ni .",
    "these two calibration points anchor our survey .",
    "multiple models for the central engine for 87a were employed and one for the crab .",
    "calibrating to these two events , and using lessons learned from previous 3d modelling efforts of core collapse , results in fiducial `` central engines '' that describe the evolution of only the inner 1.1 @xmath0  of the collapsing iron core (   [ sec : coremodel ] ) .",
    "these central engines , or inner boundary conditions are characterized by just a few physically descriptive parameters ( table [ tab : p - hotbparams ] ) .",
    "these inner core evolution prescriptions are then used to follow the evolution of 200 presupernova stars (   [ sec : solgrid ] ; table [ tab : progenitor ] ) in the mass range 9.0  120 @xmath0 . outside",
    "1.1 @xmath0 , neutrino transport was followed in an approximate , efficient way for each stellar model , thus assuring a physical representation of the explosion that was sensitive to the structure of individual presupernova stars .",
    "above 12 @xmath0 , five central engines for various sn 1987a models were employed , two of them extensively . from 9.0 to 12 @xmath0",
    ", the properties of the central engine were interpolated between crab - like and 87a - like behaviour .",
    "the crab model itself was based on a 9.6 @xmath0  star whose explosion has been previously studied in 3d .    as a result of these simulations , a large diversity of successful and",
    "failed explosions was generated .",
    "kinetic energies at infinity varied from 0.11 to 2.03 @xmath240 erg .",
    "the outcome of each calculation depended upon the structure of the presupernova star and central engine employed .",
    "all stars below 12 @xmath0  exploded , albeit weakly . despite their small compactness parameters and ease of explosion ,",
    "their final energies were low because a smaller fraction of the neutrino power radiated by the proto - neutron star was converted into kinetic energy of expansion .",
    "the steep density gradient outside the iron core reduced the absorption .",
    "conversely , larger stars trapped a larger proportion of the neutrino radiation and had a bigger neutrino luminosity from accretion , but also had a larger binding energy and ram pressure to overcome . some exploded with variable energy up to @xmath306 erg ; some not at all .",
    "there was no single mass below which all stars exploded and above which black holes formed , but rather there were islands of `` explodability '' in a sea of black hole formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_map ] ) .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite suggesting that the outcome of supernova explosions is more influenced by presupernova structure than details of the central engine , provided that engine is sufficiently powerful to explode many stars .",
    "stars above 35 @xmath0  lost their envelopes and a few that experienced severe mass loss as wolf - rayet stars exploded as type ibc supernovae , but most became black holes .",
    "typically 95% of the stars that did explode were sn iip with masses less than 20 @xmath0  ( table [ tab : stats ] ) .",
    "the median supernova mass , neglecting any explosions below 9 @xmath0 , was 12 @xmath0 .",
    "half were heavier and half lighter .",
    "the heavier half accounted for most of the nucleosynthesis .    from the baryonic masses of the remnants , it was possible to create a distribution of neutron star masses and an average .",
    "both agreed very well with observations ( table [ tab : stats ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nstarmass ] ) with typical neutron star gravitational masses near 1.40 @xmath0 .",
    "the heaviest neutron star made was 1.77 @xmath0  and the lightest , 1.23 @xmath0 . while electron capture supernovae were not computed here , their neutron stars should result from the collapse of chandrasekhar mass cores with @xmath11 still close to 0.50 .",
    "the neutron stars resulting from our 9 and 10 @xmath0  models , which have experienced appreciable electron capture during oxygen and silicon burning prior to collapse , can actually be lighter .",
    "for those stars that made black holes , which were most , but not all of the stars above 20 @xmath0  and some below 20 @xmath0 , only a few produced their black holes by fallback .",
    "stars that in past surveys produced black holes by fallback more frequently did not explode at all in the present study .",
    "the present calculations with p - hotb also included a contribution to the explosion energy from the neutrino - powered wind and from recombination , of order 10@xmath335 to 10@xmath148 erg , that gave an extra push to the inner zones during the first second or so after the shock was launched .",
    "this helped to prevent their reimplosion .",
    "usually black hole production involved the collapse of the full star , including its hydrogen envelope .",
    "other mechanisms are necessary and were invoked to explain envelope ejection during black hole formation . if the full presupernova star always collapsed the average black hole mass ( imf weighted ) was 13.3  13.8 @xmath0 ; if only the helium core collapsed , it was 7.7  9.2 @xmath0  ( table [ tab : stats ] ) .",
    "the latter is in better agreement with observations and suggests that black hole formation is accompanied by weak explosions that eject only the hydrogen envelope .",
    "these weak supernovae would have distinctive light curves and colors .",
    "the gap between neutron stars and black hole masses from @xmath12 to @xmath14 @xmath0  suggested by observations was naturally obtained because of the lack of fallback supernovae that could fill this mass interval .",
    "one important result of this study is the nucleosynthesis expected from massive stars calculated using the more realistic depiction of explosion .",
    "this was calculated using the kepler code and an amply large nuclear reaction network complete up to the element bismuth .",
    "a trajectory near the final mass cut in p - hotb was taken as the inner boundary for the kepler calculation , and the infall and time of reversal were nearly the same .",
    "the velocity of the piston in kepler was varied however , to give near perfect agreement in explosion energy with the p - hotb calculations and to reproduce the iron synthesis to better than 10% in most cases .",
    "in a few cases the latter required a slight adjustment of the piston mass .",
    "neutrino interactions , except for the neutrino process of nucleosynthesis , were neglected in the kepler studies and the neutrino - powered wind was not carried . in practice",
    "this meant the neglect of a possible @xmath7-process or @xmath336-process component and some uncertainty in the nucleosynthesis of nickel , copper and zinc .",
    "the contributions from various mass stars were then determined as well as their overall imf - weighted production factors .",
    "the lighter supernovae below 12 @xmath0 , half of all supernovae numerically , make a relatively small contribution to the overall nucleosynthesis , but are important for some elements .",
    "carbon , nitrogen , lithium , boron , and fluorine as well as numerous species in the iron group were produced in solar or super - solar proportions to oxygen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : low ] ) . besides their contribution to pop i nucleosynthesis in nature ,",
    "these abundances are also of interest for the large fraction of supernova remnants they would characterize . the iron to oxygen ratio was nearly normal , despite the fact that overall , the massive stars only account for a minor fraction of the iron in the sun (   [ sec : fegroup ] and @xcite ) .",
    "boron was unusually high owing to the operation of the neutrino process in a shell close to the neutron star with a large abundance of carbon .",
    "explosions from 12 to 30 @xmath0  are responsible for most of the nucleosynthesis . the elemental production pattern ( fig .  [ fig : mid ] ) is consistently solar from boron to copper with the expected deficiency in the iron group due to sn ia production .",
    "carbon , nitrogen , and fluorine are also greatly reduced compared with the low mass supernovae . in general , there is a tendency to slightly underproduce the intermediate mass elements , si , s , ar , and ca with respect to oxygen .",
    "this may indicate a smaller than optimal abundance for oxygen in the sun , or the lack of some other component , e.g. , sn ia .",
    "the @xmath8-process production , from cu to zr is less than in previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is problematic .    above 30 @xmath0 , there were few explosions , but even stars that make black holes still contribute their winds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : high ] ) . because mass loss rates are uncertain",
    ", the nucleosynthesis of these stars must be treated with caution . for standard assumptions , carbon and oxygen",
    "are substantially produced in the winds of massive wolf - rayet stars , and nitrogen , neon , and sodium also have important components .",
    "indeed the abundances of these light elements are so great that stars in this mass range make little else when the other productions are normalized to them .    integrating over the entire full range from 9 to 120 @xmath0 , and examining isotopes as well as elements ,",
    "the nucleosynthesis bears strong resemblance both to the solar pattern and to the earlier survey by @xcite , but with notable exceptions .",
    "@xmath9c and @xmath172ne are slightly overproduced .",
    "this might be an indication that the mass loss rates used here are high by about a factor of two , but the @xmath172ne yield would also be reduced in stars with less than solar metallicity , because of the smaller neutron excess .",
    "c and o production in the winds of low metallicity stars would also be reduced .",
    "the excesses would instead end up in black holes .",
    "a full galactic chemical evolution model would need to be done to see if these overproductions are problematic .",
    "fluorine is underproduced by a factor of two , suggesting a possible contribution from lower mass stars .",
    "radioactive @xmath196k is greatly overproduced , but this is not a problem since a large uncertain fraction of the radioactive species would decay before the sun was born .",
    "the iron group retains the underproduction seen in the mid - mass explosions , but some copper and nickel are slightly overproduced , possibly due to the neglect of neutrino interactions at the base of the ejecta .",
    "also notable are the deficient productions of @xmath197ca and @xmath206mn and of the @xmath8- and @xmath337processes .    in fact , above the iron group ,",
    "the fit to solar abundances is substantially poorer than in @xcite which used essentially the same stellar physics , but an inferior model for the explosion .",
    "the underproductions are a consequence of many massive stars that were once prolific sources of the @xmath8-process now imploding to black holes .",
    "to a lesser extent , it also reflects the use of a rate for the @xmath172ne(@xmath173n)@xmath174 mg reaction that is about @xmath150% smaller than a recent reanalysis of experimental data .",
    "given the critical role of the light @xmath8-process as a diagnostic here , our calculations should be repeated with a variable value for this rate to test the sensitivity of the outcome .",
    "the heavy @xmath215-process is also underproduced both compared with the sun and with the results from @xcite .",
    "this again reflects a deficiency of massive star explosions with thick layers that experience explosive neon burning .",
    "the origin of the light @xmath215-process below a = 130 and specifically of the nucleus @xmath338mo continues to be a mystery . in total",
    ", the nucleosynthesis would be improved if more massive stars blew up @xcite .",
    "more @xmath216al is produced relative to @xmath217fe than in the 2007 survey because some of the major producers of @xmath217fe now make black holes .",
    "this is good news , but should be treated cautiously because the same changes necessary to increase light @xmath8-process production might also increase the yield of @xmath217fe .",
    "the production ratio from the present survey for @xmath217fe/@xmath216al , averaged over a salpeter imf , is , by mass , @xmath10.90 .",
    "the observed value is 0.35 @xmath227 0.1 .",
    "the @xcite survey gave 1.8 .",
    "part of the remaining discrepancy probably has to do with uncertain reaction rates .",
    "as is well known , the underproduction of iron in massive stars is actually desirable since most of iron comes from sn ia .",
    "here we find 28% of the solar abundance relative to oxygen is made in massive stars . since both are primary elements whose synthesis is independent of neutron excess , the same ratio would probably characterize low metallicity stars .",
    "if the sn ia rate is at least 1/6 to 1/5 of the sn iip rate then iron is made in solar proportions .",
    "roughly comparable contributions from both sub - chandrasekhar mass models and the traditional chandrasekhar mass model are needed , however , to produce both @xmath197ca and @xmath206mn .",
    "the sub - chandrasekhar model also helps boost the deficient production of the alpha - nuclei from silicon through calcium .",
    "the excellent agreement of @xmath41b/@xmath35o in the integrated sample provides an accurate measure of the @xmath157- and @xmath158-neutrino temperature during proto - neutron star evolution .",
    "a total of 194 supernova light curves were calculated .",
    "the vast majority of these were sn iip but the successful explosions over 30 @xmath0  made a variety of sn ibc .",
    "these are not the common sn ibc though , because they are too faint and broad .",
    "presumably the common events come from lower mass explosions stripped of their envelopes in binary systems .",
    "the massive faint variety should exist in nature though , and should be sought .",
    "the 181 sn iip models are a community resource that is freely available^[mpa_db]^ , and they offer a rich opportunity for modelling the spectrum and colors of a large comprehensive sample with standard identical physics . here",
    "we analysed (   [ sec : popov ] ) the bolometric light curves using semi - analytic approximations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the range in plateau luminosities spans one and a half orders of magnitude , its systematics are amazingly well represented by the analytic formulae ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l50 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the systematics are well understood and encapsulated in simple scaling relations , lending confidence to the proposition that , with additional constraints from the spectrum , colors , dilution factor , etc .",
    ", sn iip may be useful cosmological yardsticks .",
    "[ fig : l50ke ] shows a tight correlation between sn iip luminosity on the plateau and its total explosion energy .",
    "this is well worth checking with an observational sample with spectroscopically determined kinetic energies .",
    "it also gives a useful tool for finding `` unusual '' supernovae .",
    "none of our explosions exceeded @xmath339 erg and none were brighter than @xmath340 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "a sn iip brighter than this , say 10@xmath237 erg s@xmath5 , then is not powered by neutrinos .",
    "this gives a physical basis for discerning `` superluminous '' supernovae of type iip .",
    "[ fig : l50ke ] also shows that the fraction of kinetic energy that comes out as light in a neutrino powered sn iip is roughly constant , @xmath341% for the 95% of sn iip",
    "lighter than 21 @xmath0 .    while the width luminosity relation for sn iip is not nearly so tight or `` calibratable '' as for sn ia , typical sn iip of a given plateau duration have the same luminosity at day 50 to about @xmath342% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wlr ] ) .",
    "this is not true , however , for a substantial sample of low energy supernovae below 12 @xmath0 .",
    "these would need to be spectroscopically distinguished on the basis of their low photospheric speed .    with less precision , the mass of the supernova progenitor",
    "can also be determined from measurements of the total radiated light ( to good approximation @xmath343 ) and estimates of the explosion energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : getmass ] ) .",
    "the figure is especially useful for distinguishing low mass supernovae but loses utility in separating supernovae in the mass range 13 to 21 @xmath0  because of the much slower variation of integrated light in this range . in practice ,",
    "the need to determine the explosion energy accurately may limit the application .",
    "the success of the present approach in fitting many observational constraints , including neutron star masses , black hole masses , supernova kinetic energies , light curves , and nucleosynthesis is gratifying , and gives hope that it may be more broadly applied in the future .",
    "the existence of a large set of models with controlled , well understood physics will be useful for the statistical analysis of large data sets in the future .",
    "there is surely room for improvement , though .",
    "nuclear reaction rates need updating and the effect of varying the mass loss should be explored .",
    "rotation can be included in the presupernova models , and approximated in the explosion",
    ". a broader range of metallicities can be explored .",
    "the core physics , currently 1d and calibrated using just two observed events can be improved by calibrating to a greater range of 3d simulations and observations .",
    "the survey can be done in 2d to capture essential aspects of the mixing , and the neutrino wind included in the yields .",
    "given the vast amount of data expected in the near future from large dedicated transient surveys , the effort is worth it and it will happen .    for now though we offer not only the results and analysis in this paper , but all presupernova models , exploded models , nucleosynthetic yields and the light curves in the electronic edition , and also at the mpa - garching archive^[mpa_db]^.",

    "<S> nucleosynthesis , light curves , explosion energies , and remnant masses are calculated for a grid of supernovae resulting from massive stars with solar metallicity and masses from 9.0 to 120 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the full evolution is followed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> a novel aspect of the survey is the use of a one - dimensional neutrino transport model for the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> this explosion model has been calibrated to give the observed energy for sn 1987a , using five standard progenitors , and for the crab supernova using a 9.6 @xmath0   progenitor . as a result of using a calibrated central engine , </S>",
    "<S> the final kinetic energy of the supernova is variable and sensitive to the structure of each presupernova star . </S>",
    "<S> many progenitors with extended core structures do not explode , but become black holes , and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that a reasonable contribution from type ia supernovae is also allowed , but with a deficiency of light s - process isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting neutron star imf has a mean gravitational mass near 1.4 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the average black hole mass is about 9 @xmath0  if only the helium core implodes , and 14 @xmath0 , if the entire presupernova star collapses . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath110% of supernovae come from stars over 20 @xmath0  and some of these are type ib or ic . </S>",
    "<S> some useful systematics of type iip light curves are explored . </S>"
