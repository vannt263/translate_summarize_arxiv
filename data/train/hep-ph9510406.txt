    "bound state systems consisting of a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark are fairly well described in terms of wave function models , where the potential among the two heavy quarks is determined from fitting a phenomenological ansatz to the data @xcite . in this way many static properties of these systems may be understood even quantitatively .",
    "as far as decays of heavy quarkonia are concerned there has been also some theoretical progress recently @xcite . for inclusive decays in which the two heavy quarks annihilate an effective theory approach has been developed allowing for a systematic treatment of these processes .",
    "this method puts the description of this type of decays on a model independent basis .",
    "the theoretical description of exclusive hadronic decays is in general still quite model dependent .",
    "however , for a large class of decay modes of excited quarkonia we may use chiral symmetry arguments to construct an effective hamiltonian for decays such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a member of the goldstone boson octet .",
    "this ansatz has been discussed already in the literature @xcite , however , without giving a systematic derivative expansion in the spirit of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "such an expansion may be performed starting from the infinite mass limit for the heavy quarkonium decays . ] .",
    "the momentum of the heavy quarkonium scales with the heavy quark masses and hence it may not be used as an expansion parameter . in order to define a systematic derivative expansion we decompose the momentum @xmath6 of the heavy quarkonium in the initial ( final ) state as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are small residual momenta of the order @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of the heavy quark and antiquark respectively .",
    "the velocity @xmath13 is the velocity of the initial state quarkonium and hence the momenta of the final state heavy quarks will be of the order of the mass difference of the initial and final state quarkonia , which we shall assume to be small compared to the masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in the spirit of chiral perturbation theory",
    "one may now formulate a derivative expansion , which after fourier transformation becomes an expansion in the pion momenta and the residual momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the next section",
    "we shall use chiral symmetry to write down the leading as well as the chiral symmetry breaking terms in such an expansion . in section 3",
    "we show that one may obtain a good fit to the data , total rates as well as invariant mass spectra of the two pions in the decay @xmath4 .",
    "we shall compare the charmonia and the bottomonia and discuss the dependence of the parameters in the effective lagrangian of the bottom and charm mass in section 4 .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "we construct an effective lagrangian for the decays of a heavy excited @xmath0-wave - spin - one quarkonium into the ground state , which is either a @xmath14 or an @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the field of the excited @xmath0-wave @xmath17 state and @xmath18 the one of @xmath17 ground state .",
    "we shall consider here only quarkonia where @xmath19 , hence we look at charmonia or bottomonia systems .",
    "the momenta of the heavy quarkonia are split into a large piece which scales as @xmath11 and a small residual part @xmath8 which depends only weakly on the heavy quark mass @xmath20 in coordinate space this is achieved by a phase redefinition of the fields @xmath21 such that the derivative acting on the fields with superscript @xmath22 is now @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) and small compared to the heavy mass .",
    "the fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 obey the equations of motion corresponding to static fields and are transverse with respect to the velocity vector @xmath13 @xmath25    we are interested in an effective lagrangian for the hadronic decays of the type @xmath26 or @xmath27 , and we construct this lagrangian using chiral symmetry .",
    "higher order terms may be included by chiral perturbation theory , i.e.  by a systematic expansion in the derivatives ( these correspond to pion momenta or residual momenta for quarkonia ) and in the light quark masses .",
    "the heavy quarkonia are singlets under the chiral symmetry , and hence the decays @xmath26 are forbidden in the chiral limit",
    ".    in the chiral limit only decays to an even number of pions are allowed , and the leading term in the derivative expansion obeying chiral symmetry consists of three terms @xmath28             + g_1 a_\\mu^{(v ) } b^{(v)\\mu * }               \\mbox { tr}[(v\\cdot\\partial u ) ( v\\cdot\\partial u)^\\dagger ]               \\nonumber\\\\           & & + g_2 a_\\mu^{(v ) } b_\\nu^{(v ) * }               \\mbox { tr}[(\\partial^\\mu u ) ( \\partial^\\nu u)^\\dagger +                          ( \\partial^\\mu u)^\\dagger ( \\partial^\\nu u ) ]             + \\mbox { h.c.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a unitary @xmath30 matrix that contains the goldstone fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the pion decay constant mev . ] in the chiral limit . in previous considerations",
    "the second term in ( [ l0 ] ) has been often omitted , but since a consistent definition of the derivative expansion forces us to introduce the vector @xmath13 , the second term is a perfectly allowed one .",
    "we shall show in the next section that the magnitude of the coupling @xmath33 is not small compared to @xmath34 , at least not for the case of charmonium , and that a reasonable fit to the invariant mass spectra of the pions may be obtained from ( [ l0 ] ) .",

    "the observation , that the data can be fitted accurately with operators allowed in the chiral limit , has been made by novikov and shifman @xcite . to our knowledge , however , the rigorous description in the language of effective lagrangians has not been presented before .    in the case of the decay amplitudes of @xmath54 where @xmath55 experimental values exist in the charmonium system , for bottomonia",
    "upper limits are known only .",

    "we shall try to achieve an at least qualitative understanding by representing the coefficients in the lagrangian by matrix elements of heavy quark operators .",
    "hence we consider a model in which the heavy quarks and the light pseudoscalar mesons are the relevant degrees of freedom ; in this respect this resembles the chiral quark model of georgi and manohar @xcite .",
    "first of all , this model easily explains the fact that the pion-@xmath47-wave contribution is suppressed , since this at least requires a dimension-6-operator for the heavy quarks , which would be contained in the operator @xmath59\\ ] ] while the pion-@xmath0-wave component may be represented by a dimension-3-operator for the heavy quarks @xmath60\\ ] ] here @xmath61 are the operators of heavy quarks which have been rescaled with a phase according to @xmath62 and the scale @xmath63 is at least of the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale or maybe even the heavy quark mass ; in the latter case the @xmath47-wave contribution to this decay would be more strongly suppressed in the @xmath2 decays as compared to the @xmath1 transitions .",
    "we have argued that the @xmath47-wave contribution is suppressed and hence we have only two operators left in the chiral limit .",
    "both operators contribute to the @xmath0-wave of the decays @xmath64 and @xmath65 . employing the model discussed above , we have the corresponding two operators on the quark level @xmath66 \\\\ \\nonumber   & + & b_0 ( \\bar{q}_v q_v ) \\mbox{tr } \\left [             ( v \\cdot \\partial u)(v \\cdot \\partial u^\\dagger ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coupling constants @xmath34 and @xmath33 are related to the couplings in the quark lagrangian @xmath67 through the relations @xmath68 from the combined chiral and heavy mass expansion one would expect that both coupling constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 scale in the same way with the heavy quark mass . as far as the mass dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath33",
    "is concerned , one has to take into account the mass dependence of the matrix element @xmath71 .",
    "for the operators itself there exists a heavy mass limit , while the mass dependence of the states may not be accessed within the framework of the @xmath72 expansion @xcite . to this end",
    "we have to rely on simple dimensionality arguments . assuming that the states are normalized to unity we may write the matrix elements as @xmath73 where @xmath63 is a scale related to the binding of the heavy quarkonia . here",
    "we may consider two extreme cases .",
    "the first one is the purely coulombic scenario , in which the parameter @xmath63 is the heavy mass times the fine structure constant @xmath74 and therefore one would expect a strong scaling with the heavy mass .",
    "this is , however , not supported by the energy differences in the known quarkonia , where e.g. the level spacing @xmath75 is practically the same in the @xmath1 system and the @xmath2 system .",
    "so we shall argue that a scenario in which @xmath63 is independent of the mass of the heavy quark is realistic , and consequently we would expect that @xmath34 and @xmath33 should scale in the same way as the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the quark level lagrangian @xmath67 . since @xmath76 is practically unity , we may assume that both couplings are of order one in the heavy mass expansion .",
    "this in turn would lead to the conclusion that @xmath77 should not scale as a power of the heavy mass .",
    "however , the coupling @xmath33 is larger in the @xmath1 system by a factor between two or three compared to the @xmath78 system .",
    "the only consistent interpretation of this factor is that @xmath79^{\\kappa } , \\hspace{2 cm } \\kappa \\simeq 2 - 3\\ ] ] consequently the second term of our effective lagrangian must be governed at the level of qcd by an operator with a sufficiently large anomalous dimension .",
    "let us finally also consider the chiral symmetry breaking contribution relevant for the decays @xmath80 and @xmath81 . interpreting this transition again in terms of a dimension-3 operator for the heavy quarks one writes @xmath82\\ ] ]",
    "the leading term in the heavy mass expansion will vanish for this operator , since @xmath83 and hence one expects the coefficients @xmath84 to scale as @xmath85 assuming again that the mass dependence of the matrix elements is weak .",
    "we have formulated an effective theory approach for the hadronic decays of heavy quarkonia based on the chiral limit for the light degrees of freedom and on the @xmath72 expansion for the heavy ones . the leading term in both the inverse of the heavy quark mass and the inverse of the chiral symmetry breaking scale consists of two terms multiplied by coupling constants which we have fitted from experiment .",
    "the fit to the invariant mass spectrum of the two pions in the decays @xmath40 and @xmath86 shown in fig.1 is quite satisfactory .",
    "we also have discussed the mass dependence of the various terms in the lagrangian which unfortunately may not be considered entirely in the effective theory .",
    "we model the leading terms of the effective lagrangian by switching to a description in which the relevant degrees of freedom are pions and heavy quarks .",
    "this model resembles the chiral quark model as proposed by georgi and manohar @xcite . in this picture",
    "the coupling constants of the quarkonia - pions effective lagrangian may be reexpressed in terms of the ones of the underlying quark lagrangian and certain matrix elements of heavy quark operators between heavy quarkonia states .",
    "the mass dependence of the matrix elements may not be evaluated from chiral and heavy quark symmetry and thus requires additional input . using a specific assumption on the mass dependence of these matrix elements we arrive at definite predictions for the ratios @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the predictions are consistent with what is found experimentally , although for @xmath89 only an experimental bound exists and more data is needed to confirm or falsify our values .",
