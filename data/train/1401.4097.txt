    "in 3 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity , black hole solutions are uniquely determined by their conserved quantum numbers ( i.e. , ` black holes have no hair ' ) .",
    "the region around the horizon is in the vacuum state for all quantum fields .",
    "quantum mechanics in this black hole background exhibits an intriguing thermodynamics : the hole has an entropy @xmath0 , a temperature @xmath1 and an energy @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 .",
    "further , the hole radiates quanta in a thermal distribution with temperature @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "but the mechanism of radiation involves pair creation at the horizon , and the radiation gets progressively more entangled with the remaining hole .",
    "this situation creates a problem near the endpoint of evaporation , where the small mass ` remnant ' must have an enormous number of internal states to carry the required entanglement @xcite .",
    "string theory does not appear to have such high degeneracy remnants , so one needs to find some mechanism that prevents the monotonic growth of entanglement during the radiation process . in @xcite",
    "it was proved , using strong subadditivity , that small corrections can not achieve this goal ; we need a correction of order unity to the dynamics at the horizon . in string theory",
    "we find the fuzzball construction @xcite , where a nonperturbative effect eludes the no - hair theorems @xcite and provides the required alteration of the hole . in a fuzzball microstate",
    "the spacetime ends just outside the horizon , because compact directions ` cap - off ' ( fig.[c6 ] ) .",
    "the structure of the cap is supported by the fluxes , branes etc .",
    "present in the theory .",
    "the fuzzball proposal then says that all microstates of the hole are fuzzballs - i.e. , no microstate has a traditional horizon .",
    "this alteration of the horizon removes the information paradox ; the fuzzball radiates from its surface just like a piece of coal .",
    "( a ) in the traditional hole , compact directions appear as a tensor product with the noncompact ones ( the tensor product is denoted by the cross ) .",
    "( b ) in a fuzzball microstate the compact directions ` cap - off ' before the horizon is reached ; different choices of ` caps ' at the various angular positions yield the entropy @xmath4 . ]    while this proposal resolves the information issue , one might ask a second question : if the horizon is not the traditional one , then do we still get black hole thermodynamics with the traditionally computed values of @xmath5 , and the hawking radiation rate @xmath6 ?",
    "for example neutron stars are also gravitating objects without a horizon , but their entropy and temperature are not given by the spacetime geometry of the star . for fuzzballs on the other hand",
    "the situation seems to be different .",
    "radiation has been computed from a very simple set of fuzzballs @xcite , and the rate of radiation was found to _",
    "exactly _ agree with the hawking emission rate predicted for these special fuzzballs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we begin by noting that all thermodynamic properties of fuzzballs will agree with the traditional hole if _",
    "one _ of them agrees ; say the entropy @xmath0 .",
    "we will then recall the gibbons - hawking computation of @xmath7 for traditional black holes @xcite , and see how this derivation needs to be modified for the situation where microstates are fuzzballs .",
    "this argument will give us @xmath8 .",
    "the entropy of fuzzballs is given by s_fuzzball(m)_fuzzball(m ) where @xmath9 is the number of fuzzballs at mass @xmath10 .",
    "suppose we knew that the entropy of fuzzballs at mass @xmath10 agreed with the traditional black hole entropy at mass @xmath10 s_fuzzball(m)= s_bh(m ) [ twtwo ] then the temperature of the typical fuzzball will agree with the traditional black hole temperature t_fuzzball(m)=t_bh(m ) [ twthree ] since in both cases we have ( setting @xmath11 ) tds = de ( for black holes this is the first law of black hole mechanics .",
    "fuzzball states describe a normal statistical system with a large number of states , so we again have the usual first law . )",
    "the radiation rates will agree as well , for the following reason .",
    "for both black holes and normal radiating bodies , the radiation rate @xmath6 is connected to the absorption cross section @xmath12 by ( ) = ( ) e^t-1 [ twone ] consider first the computation of @xmath13 for the traditional black hole .",
    "this computation starts with an incoming wave at infinity , which is partially reflected back from the geometry in the region @xmath14 .",
    "once the wave reaches @xmath15 , it does not reflect any further ; it continues to fall to the horizon @xmath16 where it is completely absorbed .",
    "thus in computing @xmath13 we find the part of the incoming wave that makes it to the region @xmath15 without being backscattered .",
    "now consider the computation of @xmath13 for absorption into a fuzzball .",
    "the fuzzball surface is presumably a few planck lengths outside @xmath16 , so the metric in the region @xmath14 is the same as the metric of the traditional hole .",
    "further , the part of the wave that reaches the fuzzball surface is absorbed almost completely , because of the large number of degrees of freedom of the fuzzball .",
    "thus we will have @xmath17 in the limit of large black holes @xmath18 .    from ( [ twone ] )",
    "we see that if @xmath19 , then we will have _ fuzzball=_bh [ twfour ] to summarize , if we are given the agreement of entropies ( [ twtwo ] ) , then the agreement of temperatures ( [ twthree ] ) and radiation rates ( [ twfour ] ) follow .",
    "let us now ask why we would expect @xmath20 . to see the nature of the argument that we will make ,",
    "consider the example of a 2-d cft with central charge @xmath21 .",
    "the number of states at energy level @xmath22 , in the limit of large @xmath22 , is @xcite ~e^2 [ thir ] for a general interacting cft , it would be very hard to prove this relation by constructing all the states at level @xmath22 and counting them .",
    "but the answer can be obtained quickly from modular invariance .",
    "for a theory that comes from a local lagrangian , we can evaluate the partition function @xmath23 on a torus through hamiltonian evolution along the two different cycles @xmath24 z = tr e^-h_=tr e^-h _ here @xmath25 are the lengths of the torus cycles in the @xmath24 directions . taking",
    "@xmath26 one can derive the relation ( [ thir ] ) .",
    "similarly , it would be very hard to compute the number of fuzzballs @xmath27 for a black hole of mass @xmath10 by constructing all the relevant fuzzballs and counting them .",
    "but if the theory arises from a local lagrangian , then there can be an alternative way of getting the count of states .",
    "we first review the computation given in @xcite of the entropy for the traditional hole , and then see how a somewhat modified argument arises in a theory where the microstates are fuzzballs .",
    "if we perform a euclidean continuation @xmath28 , the schwarzschild metric becomes ds_e^2=(1 - 2gmr)d^2+(1 - 2gmr)^-1dr^2+r^2d_2 ^ 2 [ fourt ] we compactify the @xmath29 circle with period @xmath30 ; this makes ( [ fourt ] ) have the shape of a ` cigar ' which ends smoothly at @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath31 space is shown in fig.[c1](a ) .",
    "let us now recall the steps given in @xcite for computing the black hole entropy .",
    "\\(a ) the euclidean action for gravity is s=116gr d^4 x + 18g_k d^3 x where the second term is the boundary action . for the configuration ( [ fourt ] ) , the bulk term vanishes since the curvature scalar @xmath32 is zero .",
    "the boundary contribution diverges , but we subtract the value for flat space with @xmath29 again compactified with period @xmath30 .",
    "this gives i_m - i_flat=4gm^2 [ thone ] which yields z = e^-4gm^2 [ sevent ]     ( a ) the @xmath31 space is a ` cigar ' with the topology of a disc .",
    "( b ) the bold line is the spatial slice on which a state of energy @xmath11 lives .",
    "euclidean time evolution is in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "a small hole is cut around the point @xmath16 where slices of different @xmath29 meet . ]",
    "\\(b ) now we try to compute the same @xmath23 in a hamiltonian formulation , where the time evolution is in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "the spatial slices stretch in the @xmath33 direction from @xmath16 to @xmath34 .",
    "but these slices all meet at @xmath16 ( the tip of the ` cigar ' ) , so this is not a situation where we have the topology  spatial slice @xmath35 time circle \" required for hamiltonian evolution . to remedy this problem , we cut a small disc out of @xmath31 plane around the point @xmath16 ; the resulting spatial slices are depicted in fig.[c1](b ) .",
    "we will add back the contribution of the cut - out disc as a separate term .",
    "we thus have two contributions :    \\(i ) writing ( [ thone ] ) as z=-^216 g we have e=- z=8g = m [ thtwo ] thus the path integral with the @xmath29 circle identified with period @xmath36 is peaked at configurations with energy @xmath11 .",
    "we take this energy on the spatial slice of fig.[c1](b ) , and note that this slice evolves for a time @xmath37 .",
    "this gives a contribution to the partition function @xmath23 equal to e^-e = e^-8gm^2 [ fift ]    \\(ii ) the contribution of the small disc .",
    "the bulk action gives zero since the curvature scalar @xmath32 is zero , while the boundary gives @xmath38 .",
    "thus we get a contribution to @xmath23 equalling e^4 g m^2 [ sixt ] putting together ( [ fift ] ) and ( [ sixt ] ) , we get z = e^-4gm^2 in agreement with ( [ sevent ] )",
    ". thus the hamiltonian evolution method agrees with the path integral method .    finally , we find the interpretation for the contribution of the small disc ( [ sixt ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath39 .",
    "this gives z=- et+s [ twenty ] the first term on the rhs is the contribution ( [ fift ] ) .",
    "thus we find that the entropy @xmath0 is given by the contribution ( [ sixt ] ) s_bh=4 g m^2 which can be seen to equal the well known expression @xmath40 .",
    "there are some issues of concern in this derivation :    \\(i ) once we cut out the small disc around @xmath16 , the state in ( [ fift ] ) is defined on a spatial slice that has an inner boundary .",
    "what is the significance of a state having such a boundary ?",
    "is it clear that such a state should be assigned the energy @xmath10 ?",
    "\\(ii ) while @xmath0 behaves like the entropy in the thermodynamic relation ( [ twenty ] ) , it is not clear why the entropy arrived at this way should be related in any way to a count of microstates . in particular , we do not see the differences between the @xmath41 $ ] orthogonal states that are predicted by this value of the entropy .",
    "now let us assume that we have a theory of gravity where all the microstates are fuzzballs .",
    "our question is : what will be the number @xmath42 of these fuzzballs ?     a fuzzball microstate ( defined on slice depicted by the bold line ) ` caps - off ' before reaching the horizon ; the cap is denoted by the black dot .",
    "thus we do not need to cut out a hole around @xmath16 , but do have to take into account the degeneracy factor @xmath27 arising from different possible caps . ]",
    "we will again follow a path similar to the one above where we compared the path integral computation of @xmath23 to a hamiltonian computation of @xmath23 .",
    "we first outline the steps , and in the following section comment on the physical picture underlying the computation .",
    "\\(a ) we work with the euclidean theory and compactify the time direction @xmath29 with period @xmath30 , just as before .",
    "we consider the path integral over all metrics that have mass @xmath10 at infinity .",
    "we assume that the solution ( [ fourt ] ) is a saddle point to this path integral , thus getting z = e^-4gm^2 [ seventq ] ( this step is the same as the corresponding step in the gibbons - hawking argument . )",
    "\\(b ) now consider the hamiltonian evolution along the @xmath29 direction . in hawking s argument , the spatial slices all met at @xmath16 , so we had to cut out a small disc around this location .",
    "but fuzzball microstates ` cap - off ' before the horizon location @xmath16 is reached ( fig.[c2 ] ) .",
    "thus there is no disc that we need to cut out , and consequently , no contribution from the action of such a disc .",
    "instead , we have the following contributions :    \\(i ) by the same reasoning as in ( [ thtwo ] ) , the states contributing to the path integral are peaked around the energy @xmath11 .",
    "any one such state contributes to @xmath23 an amount e^-e = e^-8gm^2 [ fiftq ] ( this is the same as ( [ fift ] . )",
    "\\(ii ) we have a degeneracy factor from the region near @xmath16 of the spatial slice , where we get different ` caps ' for different microstates .",
    "letting @xmath27 be the number of fuzzballs of mass @xmath10 , we get . ] z = n_fuzzball e^-8 g m^2 [ eighttq ]    now equating ( [ seventq ] ) to ( [ eighttq ] ) we get _ fuzzball = e^4 g m^2 this gives the entropy s_fuzzball_fuzzball=4 g m^2=a4 g [ twfive ] this is the same as the entropy computed in the hawking computation ; i.e. , we get the desired relation ( [ twtwo ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ twfive ] ) is the main result of this paper .",
    "a key point in the argument is the fact that fuzzball states are wavefunctionals defined on the space of manifolds that have no boundary near @xmath16 ; instead these manifolds have a topology that allows them to ` cap - off ' .",
    "because of this ` capping - off ' , the spatial slices do not meet at a common point @xmath16 the way they did in the computation of @xcite .",
    "consequently , we do not need to cut out a disc around @xmath16 to define a good hamiltonian evolution .",
    "thus we do not get a contribution to @xmath23 from the gravitational action of the disc , but in its place we get something more physical : an explicit degeneracy factor @xmath27 from the different possible ` cap ' states .",
    "we have addressed the question : should the number of fuzzball states equal @xmath43 $ ] , the value suggested by black hole thermodynamics ? it is difficult to explicitly construct and count all fuzzball states for a black hole .",
    "but we can use an indirect argument similar to the modular invariance relation used to count the states of a general 2-d cft .",
    "we have followed the lines of @xcite where the euclidean path integral @xmath23 was computed in two ways : a saddle point evaluation and a hamiltonian evolution . implementing the changes",
    "required for the situation where all microstates are fuzzballs , we arrived at the relation ( [ twtwo ] ) .",
    "once the entropy of fuzzballs agrees with the traditional entropy of the black hole , we argued that other thermodynamic quantities would have to agree as well .    in what follows , we comment on the assumptions that have been made and discuss the physical picture suggested by the ` completeness ' of fuzzball states .",
    "we end with some remarks on the euclidean and lorentzian sections of the black hole .",
    "since our argument is subject to these assumptions , we have not given a ` derivation ' of the agreement of entropies ( [ twtwo ] ) .",
    "but what we have argued is that under these qualitative assumptions , the number of fuzzballs would be a definite number - the one given by the standard bekenstein entropy - and not some other arbitrary number .",
    "note that these assumptions are a nontrivial statement about the physics of our gravity theory ( string theory ) , since they can be violated for other theories :    ( i ) consider the 0 + 1 dimensional matrix model , which at low energies gives a 1 + 1 dimensional gravity theory .",
    "the low energy effective action has a euclidean saddle point , but in the full theory quantum corrections invalidate the semiclassical approximation and prevent the formation of a black hole @xcite .",
    "thus for this theory quantum fluctuations must invalidate the role of this saddle point as a leading order approximation to the path integral .",

    "\\(a ) it was argued in @xcite that the semiclassical geometry of the lorentizian black hole is destroyed by tunneling into the large number of possible fuzzball states .",
    "the fuzzball states are concentrated just outside @xmath16 , and so we expect the path integral in ( [ seventq ] ) to be concentrated on metrics that live in the region @xmath44 .",
    "we have assumed that this path integral has the saddle point ( [ fourt ] ) , and the @xmath31 space of this saddle point metric is depicted in fig.[c1](a ) .",

    "\\(b ) before we move on to the hamiltonian slicing leading to ( [ eighttq ] ) , consider the evaluation of @xmath23 by a different slicing , indicated in fig.[c3](a ) . here",
    "we have taken spacial slices that move smoothly through the central point @xmath16 .",
    "recall that we have compact directions in our theory ; these directions are important for the fuzzball construction . in fig.[c3](b ) we draw the slice passing through @xmath16 , with a compact direction now explicitly exhibited as the circular direction of a cylinder . in fig.[c4 ] we depict the lattice points ( from the above mentioned lattice ) which lie on this cylinder ; let these points be labelled by an index @xmath51 .",

    "we can expand the same state @xmath54 $ ] either as eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian given by the links in fig.[c4 ] , or by the links depicted above . in the case above , the inner ends of the cylinders have points identified with their diametrically opposite points , causing each of the cylinders to end in a cross - cap . ]",

    "we can get different eigenstates of @xmath60 ( with the same energy ) by taking different excitations of the springs on the links .",

    "] adding over the @xmath27 values of the index @xmath63 , we get the full partition function _ a z_a = z [ thirty ] we thus have a ` fuzzball duality ' which says that the contributions of all the fuzzballs add up to give the full path integral for the given compactification at infinity .",
    "it is important to note that we should not take the path integral @xmath23 in eq.([seventq ] ) and _ also _ take the contribution of fuzzball states ; that would be overcounting .",
    "what happens instead is that the fuzzball states give a way of decomposing the full path integral into parts ; each part arises from a state that has support only on manifolds that end without boundary in a ` cap ' .",
    "it is a nontrivial statement that these fuzzball states are complete in the sense that they give ( [ thirty ] ) .",
    "one may ask : what is the point of writing the full path integral @xmath23 in terms of fuzzballs ?",
    "if the goal is just to compute the euclidean path integral @xmath23 , then we can imagine doing this path integral without the decomposition into fuzzball states .",
    "but most of the interesting questions about black holes lie in the lorentzian section , where physical black hole processes can be considered .",
    "when we rotate back to the lorentzian section @xmath64 , the eigenstates at energy @xmath10 are still the fuzzball states @xmath61 at energy @xmath10 .",
    "these states are wavefunctionals on the space of geometries that end compactly without boundary .",
    "thus these states do not have the traditional horizon which would have the vacuum in its vicinity .",
    "it is this fact which resolves the information paradox .",
    "we should contrast the computation here with the approach of sen @xcite , where the goal is to count all the microstates of an extremal hole with a given charge . in the latter approach one finds the bekenstien - wald entropy @xcite from the traditional geometry of the hole , and adds in contributions from ` hair ' modes .",
    "the result agrees perfectly with the count of states derived from d - brane counting along lines similar to @xcite .",
    "but as was noted in @xcite , the entropy obtained in this way from the traditional horizon should not be taken as a count of states which individually have a traditional horizon .",
    "rather , the traditional black hole metric used in @xcite should be thought of being in the euclidean section , i.e. , the analogue of the metric ( [ fourt ] ) .",
    "this is the case for two reasons :    \\(1 ) in the lorentzian section , the traditional hole has a central singularity which can be accessed by a finite proper time of infall from the region outside the horizon .",
    "thus , as a lorentzian metric , the exterior of the horizon does not define a complete string background .",
    "if we extend the string background to cover the interior of the hole , then we encounter the singularity which is not an allowed source in string theory .",
    "the approach of @xcite requires an exact string background , so it is not clear how the traditional lorentzian solution could be used .",
    "\\(2 ) the solution used in @xcite is obtained by setting the coupling @xmath48 to zero in the duality frame where one is working .",
    "thus this metric is a formal solution that is used as a tool to compute the entropy ; it is not an actual state of the theory which would have to be defined at whatever ( nonzero ) value of the coupling we have .",
    "thus the computation of @xcite should be thought of as extending a gibbons - hawking type euclidean computation in a way that yields the exact entropy ( for extremal holes ) instead of just the leading order bekenstein entropy .",
    "it should not be taken to imply that actual microstates have traditional horizons .",
