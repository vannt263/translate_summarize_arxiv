    "recent years have seen great strides in our ability to simulate global properties of accretion disks in a fashion dependent on actual physical mechanisms rather than _ ad hoc _ phenomenological models .",
    "beginning a decade ago , several algorithms have been developed capable of treating 3d mhd in full general relativity @xcite . with those algorithms ,",
    "it has become possible to study the bolometric energy budget of radiatively efficient accretion onto black holes @xcite , and from it predict details of the spectra of stellar - mass black holes both in the thermal - dominant state @xcite and in other spectral states @xcite .",
    "potentially , fits of these predictions to measured spectra taken in the thermal state could be used to constrain the spin of the black hole and the inclination of the disk @xcite .",
    "however , to make these measurements quantitative requires careful attention to a variety of sources of systematic error .",
    "possible contributors to the error budget include uncertainties about atmospheric effects , both lte and non - lte , the disk inclination angle ( spectral fitting leaves spin and inclination degenerate ) , the vertical structure of disks , and the intrinsic surface brightness profile of the disk .",
    "the two latter issues are both amenable to study through simulations , but both also exhibit subtle sensitivities to algorithm ( e.g. , the consequences of internal radiation pressure : @xcite ) and grid resolution . in particular , after the first generation of global energy budget simulations were completed , @xcite showed that only one of them ( thinhr : @xcite ) even came close to having the spatial resolution required for a proper description of nonlinear mhd turbulence in the disk context ; the others all fell far short . unfortunately , the noble et  al .",
    "work treated only a schwarzschild spacetime and therefore gave little aid to constraining spin .",
    "it is the first goal of this paper to present three new simulations in kerr spacetime ( spin parameters @xmath3 , 0.9 , and 0.99 ) with resolution and vertical scale height comparable to that of the noble et  al .",
    "schwarzschild simulation . with the resulting data , we have constructed predictions of the surface brightness profile and the resulting thermal spectra and",
    "compare them to previous results .",
    "additionally , we make predictions of spin - dependent effects in the polarization spectrum of the thermal state , and show how spectropolarization observations can break degeneracies that have traditionally plagued the continuum fitting method for measuring spin .",
    "lastly , we present a new analytic model for the emissivity profile of disks in the thermal - dominant state , applicable to _ any _ value of @xmath4 .    in general , we find these new simulations lead to results similar to the non - spinning case described in @xcite .",
    "namely , the mhd disks produce a significant amount of additional flux in the region around the inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "this additional luminosity is manifest in a small , but consistent , increase in flux at the high - energy tail of the thermal spectrum as measured by a distant observer .",
    "fitting the simulated spectra to traditional analytic thin disk models ( e.g. , @xcite ) therefore leads to small but significant bias towards higher spin parameters .",
    "our proposed emissivity profile provides a better overall fit to the data , as well as generally a more faithful inference of the spin parameter .",
    "our simulations were carried out with the harm3dcode @xcite and were designed to resemble closely the thinhr schwarzschild simulation of @xcite .",
    "all used the same cooling function and target temperature profile , designed to keep the disk aspect ratio @xmath5 .",
    "all also began with the same initial condition , a hydrostatic torus with a pressure maximum at @xmath6 and an inner edge at @xmath7 ( here and subsequently , we use units in which @xmath8 ) . threading these tori there was a dipolar magnetic field with mean initial plasma @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial grids for the three kerr spacetime simulations were very similar to the one utilized for the schwarzschild case ; the only alteration was to extend the radial grid to smaller kerr - schild radii in order to follow the shrinkage of the event horizon with increasing spin .",
    "as in the earlier work , our radial grid was logarithmic ( i.e. , constant @xmath10 ) and stretched from just inside ( 5 cells ) the event horizon to @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , there were 912 , 960 , 1020 , and 1056 radial cells in the simulations with @xmath12 , 0.5 , 0.9 , and 0.99 , respectively .",
    "in all four simulations , there were 160 cells in the polar angle direction , and these cells were strongly concentrated to the equatorial plane .",
    "likewise in all cases , the simulation domain included only the 1/4 circle from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , with 64 cells across that range and periodic boundary conditions that mapped cells at @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "boundary conditions on the inner and outer radial surfaces were outflow ; the polar - angle boundaries at the axis ( @xmath15 ) were continuous across the pole .",
    "the thinhr simulation was run to a time 15,000@xmath16 ; the kerr simulations were run to @xmath1717,000  18,000@xmath16 .",
    "as is generally the case , inflow equilibrium , to the degree it is achieved , begins at the isco and gradually moves outward .",
    "it can be characterized in ( at least ) two ways : by a statistical steady - state in the accretion rate onto the black hole and by constancy in the accretion rate as a function of radius when time - averaged over the period of interest .",
    "here we show both measures .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot_t ] shows how the accretion rate through the event horizon varied over time in all four simulations .",
    "the peak accretion rates were similar in all four simulations , but , particularly at late times , there is a tendency for the accretion rate to diminish with increasing spin .",
    "this tendency was also seen in earlier global simulations with thicker disks and shorter durations @xcite . because the period before 10,000@xmath16 tends to be dominated by transients associated with initial channel solutions , we have restricted our analysis of disk output to periods after that time , 10,000 ",

    "when @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 across the entire range of radii ; when @xmath3 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with comparable quality factors for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these numbers compare very favorably with the standard set by @xcite and @xcite that for proper description of the nonlinear development of mhd turbulence in accretion disks if @xmath34 , then @xmath25 should be @xmath35 .      given the density , cooling rate , and four - velocity of the fluid at each point in the simulation , we construct a disk surface temperature map as in @xcite . for the purpose of ray - tracing to infinity , we remove the geometric effects of finite disk thickness , assuming that all the thermal flux comes from a thin disk near the midplane , while still preserving the time and azimuthal variability in the simulation data .",
    "@xcite do the former , but not the latter , leading to systematically softer spectra .",
    "the radiation is emitted from this surface with the limb - darkening and polarization properties appropriate for a scattering - dominated , optically thick atmosphere @xcite .",
    "since we are in this paper primarily focused on the thermal state , in which the coronal compton-@xmath36 parameter is expected to be small , we ignore any scattering in the corona ( to a large degree , in the thermal state , the corona can simply be thought of as an extension of the accretion disk atmosphere ) .",
    "the photons therefore follow geodesic paths from the disk until they reach the distant observer or are captured by the event horizon . however , because we are also interested in polarization signatures , we include scattering of returning radiation off the optically - thick disk body , as in @xcite .    as a test of this method",
    ", we have also tried using emission models that include only the disk proper , as defined by the region between electron - scattering photospheres , as in @xcite .",
    "this approach requires specifying a physical accretion rate in order to fix the density scale in cgs units . for @xmath37 in eddington units ( roughly the lower limit of the thermal - dominant state )",
    ", we find that , for the @xmath27 run , roughly @xmath38 of the dissipation takes place in the disk proper , with that number rising to @xmath39 for the spinning cases .",
    "for all cases , we find that the coronal and disk radial emissivity profiles are nearly identical .",
    "thus , if we were to include only the disk emission , the thermal luminosity would decrease slightly , but the spectral shape remains unchanged .",
    "one of the most basic results that comes from these global mhd simulations is the total radiative efficiency of the thin accretion disk .",
    "astrophysically , this number is critical for connecting the accretion history and growth of super - massive black holes in the universe with the observed luminosity and mass distribution functions @xcite . while it is almost impossible to measure the efficiency of an individual black hole , the shape of the thermal spectrum ( which of course is observable ) is empirically related to the radiative efficiency because higher efficiency is typically due to higher emission at small radii , producing higher temperatures and harder spectra .    in table",
    "[ table : eta ] we show several measures of the radiative efficiency .",
    "we define @xmath40 ( radiated ) to be the ratio between the time - averaged luminosity emitted by the disk and the time - averaged rest - mass accretion rate ( photon energy and observer time both measured at infinity ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 ( captured ) is the ratio of the time - averaged luminosity crossing the horizon to the time - averaged accretion rate ( for photons crossing the horizon , the energy - at - infinity is easy to measure : @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus the net radiative efficiency measured at infinity is @xmath40(radiated)-@xmath40(captured ) .",
    "@xmath42 is the classical novikov - thorne efficiency , and @xmath43 is calculated from our simulations .",
    "note that @xmath42 ( radiated ) is identical to the specific binding energy of a test particle orbiting at the isco .",
    "lastly , for the simulation data , we also show @xmath43 ( advected ) , a measure of the accreted energy carried into the hole in the form of heat and magnetic field . in principle",
    ", this energy could be liberated via additional radiation mechanisms .",
    "as first shown in @xcite , we find that very little radiation is actually captured by the black hole .",
    "although the additional flux emitted near and inside the isco leads to somewhat higher capture fractions than the nt model would predict , it is still less than @xmath44 of the total emitted flux even for @xmath18 . in the end , the net radiative efficiency is quite close to @xmath42 , as the additional mhd dissipation is negated by capture and advection , consistent with earlier work @xcite . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "much of the increase in radiative efficiency relative to nt is due to the enhanced emission near the isco , both immediately inside and outside that radius .    in a certain sense ,",
    "our figures for the efficiency are conservative estimates . by adopting an initial condition with nested dipolar field loops ,",
    "we assure that there is some net magnetic flux trapped on the event horizon , but in terms of the @xmath45 measure introduced by @xcite , it is smaller than the maximum that can be achieved .",
    "here we use the definition of @xcite , in which @xmath46 , for accretion rate @xmath47 , gravitational radius @xmath48 , and @xmath49 the integral of the absolute value of the radial magnetic field around a spherical surface containing the black hole .",
    "when @xmath50 ( roughly @xmath51 the value in our simulation ) , @xcite found that the radiative efficiency of a disk with somewhat greater aspect ratio ( @xmath52 ) orbiting in an @xmath53 spacetime was roughly double what we found for the same spin parameter .",
    "this contrast suggests that the magnetic augmentation to radiative efficiency rises very sharply over the range in @xmath45 between these values .",
    "however , in thermal states of black hole binaries , which do not show evidence of radio jets , one might not expect such large values of @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic field topology in accreting black holes is entirely unknown . other sorts of field topology  higher - order multipoles in the poloidal field or intrinsically toroidal field  may exist , and how the efficiency behaves as a function of net toroidal flux , etc . , remains to be explored .",
    "all that can be said at the moment is that for @xmath45 comparable to or smaller than in our simulations , the internal magnetic stresses depend only weakly on the field topology @xcite .",
    "we see significant variability of the accretion rate and radiative efficiency within each simulation , as well as qualitative differences from one simulation to the next ( e.g. , differences in the radial fluid properties that do not appear to vary monotonically with spin ) , representative of the stochastic nature of the turbulent mhd disks . in principle , we could carry out an ensemble of runs for each spin to measure both the mean radiative efficiency and the variance of the observed efficiency due to the random fluctuations in the simulations",
    ". however , even the four simulations we did carry out were extremely expensive computationally , and any more would be very difficult to justify .",
    ".[table : eta ] for a range of spins , the emitted bolometric radiative efficiency @xmath40 ( radiated ) and the fraction of flux captured by the black hole @xmath40 ( captured ) , for both nt disks and harm3dsimulations . also listed is the fraction of advected thermal and magnetic energy in the mhd simulations . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these results are in agreement with the findings of @xcite , finding a modest but consistent overestimate of the spin parameter when fitting to a nt disk model .",
    "@xcite also found a systematic error due to assuming the nt model , but of slightly smaller magnitude than both @xcite and the new results presented here .",
    "some possible explanations for these differences were outlined in detail in @xcite .",
    "one potential distinction mentioned there was the difference between averaging over @xmath54 and @xmath55 before or after calculating the spectra .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail below in section [ sec : fitangle ] , but for the purposes of facilitating direct comparison with @xcite , the fits in table [ table : spin_fit_2_10 ] were done _",
    "after _ averaging the simulation data over time and azimuth , then carrying out a single ray - tracing spectral calculation .    the fits quoted in table [ table : spin_fit_2_10 ]",
    "were carried out over the energy range 210 kev , appropriate for the large body of archival data from black holes in the thermal state . from figure",
    "[ fig : spec_fits ] , it is clear that this energy range is also ideal for distinguishing between different spins for systems with comparable masses and luminosities to the fiducial @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "when performing the fits over a wider energy range 0.110 kev , the outer disk contributes greater weight , yet this part of the spectrum is nearly independent of black hole spin , so the net effect is almost negligible , and we find nearly identical values for the best - fit spins .    not surprisingly , the sbpl model does a better job at recovering the spin parameter for the target spectra , particularly for smaller values of the spin , where emission from the isco region is relatively more important .",
    "the small variations from perfect fitting are likely due to the stochastic nature of the mhd simulations as described above .",
    "there does not appear to be any clear trend for systematic offsets with observer inclination .",
    "taken together , the deviations between the target spins and the best - fit sbpl spins can be taken as a rough estimate for the systematic error in the spin fitting method . comparing with table [ table : eta ] , it is clear that the radiative efficiency alone is not a sufficient measure of the thermal emissivity : the mhd simulations give efficiencies that are very similar to nt , but the shapes of the observed thermal spectra show deviations from the classic thin disk model . and ultimately , it is the spectral shape that is observed , not the radiative efficiency .      as shown in figure [ fig : spec_fits ] , the shape of the thermal spectrum in the @xmath59 kev band is a function of the black hole spin . for a fixed bolometric luminosity ,",
    "a larger spin leads to a higher disk temperature because the total radiative power is emitted from a smaller region .",
    "however , relativistic beaming and doppler blue - shifting of photons emitted from a highly inclined disk have a similar hardening effect on the observed spectrum .",
    "together , there is an almost perfect degeneracy between the black hole spin and the observer inclination angle . to demonstrate this , we plot in figure [ fig : contourjs1 ] contours of @xmath60 between a simulated target spectrum generated from the mhd data with @xmath61 and @xmath53 , and a template of fitting spectra based on the sbpl model .",
    "the simulated spectral data have poisson error bars consistent with an observation of roughly @xmath62 photons divided into 10 energy bins , typical of what might be expected from a first - generation x - ray polarimeter @xcite .",
    "contours of @xmath60 for simulated spectral observations of an accreting black hole in the thermal state .",
    "the spectrum is fit in the range @xmath59 kev with energy resolution of @xmath63 .",
    "the target system ( marked by * ) has spin parameter @xmath53 , inclination @xmath61 , mass @xmath64 , and luminosity @xmath65 .",
    "the contours represent 1- , 2- , and 3-@xmath66 confidence limits.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this degeneracy is a well - known problem with the continuum fitting method , and is generally resolved by assuming a specific inclination derived from the optical light curve of the distorted stellar companion @xcite .",
    "one systematic problem with this approach is that the inclination of the inner disk may very well be misaligned with the inclination of the binary orbit @xcite .",
    "another important issue in fitting observations is properly treating the scattering atmosphere of the accretion disk . because the electron scattering opacity dominates over free - free absorption for the temperatures and densities expected in the inner disk",
    ", we expect a wien spectrum for the local emission @xcite . for fitting our simulated spectra to nt or sbpl models , motivated by @xcite we used a simple hardening factor of 1.8 as in @xcite .",
    "when fitting real observational data , @xcite find that more detailed atmospheric models are required to achieve a good fit @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above in section [ section : results ] , there is also the issue of t- and @xmath55-averaging the data before carrying out the ray - tracing calculation .",
    "this averaging has the effect of softening the observed spectrum .",
    "consider an annulus of the disk with a uniform temperature @xmath67 . if instead , the total thermal flux were emitted from a series of discrete hotspots of temperature @xmath68 and covering fraction @xmath69 , while maintaining the same total flux , the new spectrum is a higher - temperature blackbody with color - correction factor @xmath70 .    as a test of this effect , we generated spectra both before and after averaging in time and azimuth , and find that by first averaging the simulation data and using a color - correction factor of @xmath71 , we can exactly match the spectra that result from using the full time - varying 3d data with @xmath72 and then integrating the light curves in time and azimuth .",
    "of course , nature uses the latter method , so if the observational data best fits an azimuthally symmetric model best with a certain hardening function , one must keep in mind that this in fact corresponds to a somewhat softer local spectrum coming from an inhomogeneous disk .",
    "careful analysis of x - ray timing properties may be one promising way of breaking this degeneracy and lead to greater understanding of the properties of the accretion disk atmosphere .      as discussed in detail in @xcite ,",
    "x - ray polarization observations of black holes in the thermal state provide a powerful new way to probe the dynamics of the inner accretion flow , and thereby measure the black hole spin .",
    "@xcite showed that the photons emitted from a plane - parallel , scattering - dominated atmosphere are polarized in a direction parallel to the emitting surface .",
    "the degree of polarization ranges from 0 for face - on observers up to @xmath73 for edge - on observers . because of relativistic effects such as beaming and gravitational lensing ,",
    "the net polarization of light from the inner regions of an accretion disk is reduced in magnitude , and the angle of polarization is rotated . because higher - energy photons come from the inner regions , these relativistic effects are energy dependent , and thus the polarization spectrum can be used to probe the inner disk .",
    "this technique was first proposed over thirty years ago by @xcite , who considered only direct radiation from the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite included the effects of returning radiation , photons emitted from the disk , deflected by the black hole , and reflected off the far side of the disk before reaching the distant observer .",
    "these photons are strongly polarized by the large - angle scattering geometry and impart a significant polarization signature to the total radiated flux .    for the purpose of analyzing the x - ray polarization , we define the black hole spin axis to be along the vertical direction , so a polarization angle of @xmath74 is parallel to the disk .",
    "this is the case for the low - energy photons emitted at large radii , where relativistic effects are negligible .",
    "the high - energy photons emitted close to the black hole are more likely to contribute to the returning radiation and scatter into the vertical polarization mode .",
    "since the disks around rapidly spinning black holes extend closer to the horizon , they should exhibit more vertical polarization , and the transition from horizontal to vertical polarization occurs at a lower energy .",
    "polarization amplitude ( top ) and angle ( bottom ) for thermal disks as a function of photon energy for a range of black hole spins . in all cases ,",
    "the black hole parameters are @xmath56 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   polarization amplitude ( top ) and angle ( bottom ) for thermal disks as a function of photon energy for a range of black hole spins . in all cases ,",
    "the black hole parameters are @xmath56 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure [ fig : polarization ] we plot the angle and degree of polarization from the mhd simulation data as a function of photon energy for our fiducial parameters @xmath56 , @xmath65 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the spectropolarization signal is clearly sufficient to distinguish between different spins with even modest energy resolution .",
    "the near overlap of the @xmath27 and @xmath53 curves is due to the anomalously low ( high ) flux from the @xmath53 ( @xmath27 ) simulations , as described above .",
    "real observations would cover a much longer duration of time , smoothing out the stochastic variability seen in the much shorter simulations .",
    "polarization also provides a complementary observable that can break the spin - inclination degeneracy inherent in the traditional spectral continuum fitting method @xcite . to demonstrate its power , we perform the same sort of spectral fitting shown in figure [ fig : contourjs1 ] , but using the broad - band polarization information displayed in figure [ fig : polarization ] . instead of the intensity spectrum",
    ", we use the energy - dependent stokes parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as in @xcite .",
    "again , we use a simulated spectrum from a target disk with @xmath53 and @xmath61 . for a broad - band photoelectric polarimeter like praxys @xcite ,",
    "@xmath62 photons divided roughly equally between 10 energy bands gives a 1-@xmath66 uncertainty on the polarization degree of about @xmath79 per band .",
    "fitting the polarization information with the sbpl model between 2 - 10 kev , we get the confidence contours shown in figure [ fig : contourjs2 ] . at 2 kev",
    "there is still significant returning radiation , so the polarization signal is not a perfect probe of disk inclination",
    ". a soft x - ray polarimeter sensitive over the 0.1 - 0.5 kev band would significantly improve sensitivity to disk inclination .",
    "the slight spin - inclination degeneracy seen in figure [ fig : contourjs2 ] can be understood as follows . from figure",
    "[ fig : polarization ] it is clear that the location of the transition from horizontal to vertical orientation occurs at lower energy for increasing spin . this transition is due to a small number of highly polarized returning photons dominating over the vast majority of weakly polarized direct photons . at higher inclinations ,",
    "the direct signal is more highly polarized , so is harder to overcome with returning photons , and thus the transition point shifts to higher energy where the contribution from returning radiation is higher .",
    "therefore , to maintain a constant transition energy , increasing inclinations require a higher spin .",
    "contours of confidence limits as in figure [ fig : contourjs1 ] , but now also considering polarization spectra @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the simulated sensitivity corresponds to a minimum detectable polarization of @xmath80.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    comparing the contours in figure [ fig : contourjs2 ] , we see that the degeneracy due to continuum fitting and that due to polarization intersect at a significant angle . as a result ,",
    "the range of both parameters consistent with a good fit is substantially reduced .",
    "clearly , x - ray spectropolarimetry observations have the potential to be of great benefit to measurements of black hole spin and inclination .    for all of the contours in figure [ fig :",
    "contourjs2 ] , we used the sbpl model for the radial emissivity profile . when redoing them with a nt model as in @xcite , not surprisingly we get very similarly shaped contours for @xmath60 , but with a systematic offset towards higher spin .",
    "however , we find that the actual minimum in @xmath58 is consistently lower for the sbpl model than for nt . for the fiducial observations used above with @xmath62 photons over the 2 - 10 kev band , combined spectral and polarization fits to the mhd data prefer the sbpl model at roughly @xmath39 confidence . for a photon - limited (",
    "as opposed to background - limited ) detector , this significance would simply grow with more and longer observations .",
    "thus , x - ray polarimetry combined with x - ray spectroscopy can also be a significant aid in distinguishing different emissivity profiles , thereby creating a new diagnostic of accretion dynamics in the innermost regions of accretion disks around black holes .",
    "we have carried out a new series of high - resolution grmhd simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes . using a physically motivated cooling function to emulate radiative losses ,",
    "we have found a single broken power - law model that accurately describes the luminosity profile of the thermal emission from these disks . by reframing the profile in terms of a new radial coordinate",
    ", this model can capture the additional emissivity near the isco produced by mhd stresses , but omitted by the traditional novikov - thorne model .",
    "these new profiles should more accurately fit the 2 - 10 kev spectra observed from stellar - mass black holes in the thermal state , thereby reducing systematic errors in parameter estimates of black hole spin and inclination .",
    "although a single power - law index for the inner radial dependence of the surface brightness fits all our simulations quite well , it is possible that this index might be altered if , for example , the magnetic field topology were different .",
    "we have further found that the polarization induced by returning radiation @xcite offers a powerful probe for tightening these parameter inferences .",
    "it constrains both the spin and the inclination in a way having little degeneracy with the spectral method . at the same time",
    ", it can also constrain the detailed shape of the intrinsic disk radial luminosity profile ( including the possibility of a different inner power - law index ) . moreover , because the trajectories of the returning radiation photons pass close to the black hole s photon orbit , this method probes as deeply into the regime of strong - field relativistic gravity as almost any imaginable observational method .",
    "here we present a simple procedure for generating the phenomenological emissivity profile that best matches the mhd simulations , for a range of black hole spin parameters .",
    "we begin by defining a new radial coordinate that captures the effects of increased proper distance as measured by a geodesic observer near the black hole : @xmath81 with @xmath82 the standard differential radial coordinate in boyer - lindquist coordinates . integrating equation ( [ eqn : drtilde ] ) gives @xmath83 as a function of @xmath84 with the condition that they are equal when @xmath85 .",
    "we next scale by the isco radius to define another coordinate @xmath86 . with these coordinates",
    ", the universal emissivity function can be written as a smoothly - broken power law of the form @xmath87^{\\xi\\ , \\delta r}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath88 is an overall normalization factor , @xmath89 is the location of the power - law break , @xmath90 is the width of the break , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the slopes of the power law at small and large radii respectively , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we fix @xmath95 to give the proper behavior at large @xmath84 , and @xmath88 is determined by the total mass accretion rate . for the remaining free parameters , we find the best simultaneous fit with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .    from equations ( [ eqn : sbpl ] ) and ( [ eqn : frstar ] ) above , we can write the local flux as @xmath99 for purely blackbody emission , the local temperature is then given by @xmath100^{1/4}$ ] .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath88 in ( [ eqn : sbpl ] ) is simply a function of the total luminosity : @xmath101 and scales linearly with the mass accretion rate .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath16 comes in when converting the dimensionless coordinate @xmath102 to cgs units , leading to a factor of @xmath103 in equation ( [ eqn : frstara ] ) , giving the familiar scaling of disk temperature @xmath104 .",
    "this simple procedure works well to construct physically - motivated models for thin accretion disks for all spins up to @xmath111 .",
    "above that limit , the coordinate @xmath112 takes on negative values outside of the isco . for extreme spins above this value ,",
    "we recommend following the traditional novikov - thorne emissivity models , which in any case have almost no remaining plunging region between the isco at @xmath113 and the horizon at @xmath114 .",
