    "the lattice simulations are presently considered as the only first principle tool to investigate the deconfinement phase transition ( pt ) in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "such a pt is also expected in gluodynamics ( gd ) which is a pure non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the svetitsky - jaffe hypothesis @xcite relates the deconfinement pt in ( d+1)-dimensional su(n ) gd to the magnetic pt in z(n ) symmetric spin model in d - dimensions .",
    "the local polyakov loops in gd are playing the role of spins in z(n ) symmetric spin model .",
    "for the ( d+1)-dimensional lattice having the size @xmath2 the local polyakov loop is defined by the temporal gauge links @xmath3 as @xmath4 a high level of understanding of the spin systems along with the svetitsky - jaffe hypothesis led to a significant progress in studying the su(n ) gd properties in the pt vicinity .",
    "formation of geometrical clusters composed of the polyakov loops is an important feature of gd @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon is well known in spin systems and it is responsible for percolation of clusters , which already was studied in gd with paying a special attention to the largest and the next to the largest clusters @xcite .",
    "however , already from the famous fisher droplet model ( fdm ) @xcite it is well - known that some essential features of the liquid - gas pt are encoded in the properties of smaller clusters .",
    "a principally important feature of the fdm ( and all its followers ) is that at the critical point the size distribution of physical clusters obeys a power law which is controlled by the fisher topological exponent @xmath0 .",
    "hence the value of @xmath0 maybe a key element both for developing a consistent cluster model of liquid - gas pt for qcd and for experimental localization of the qcd critical point with its help .",
    "therefore , in this work we study the geometrical clusterization in su(2 ) gd and analyze the properties of clusters of all possible sizes .",
    "this approach allows us to explain the deconfinement of color charges as the liquid - gas pt @xcite of special kind .",
    "in case of su(2 ) gauge group @xmath5 has the real values from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . similarly to spin models , for a given lattice configuration",
    "the polyakov loops being the nearest neighbors can be attributed to the same cluster , if they have the same sign .",
    "the boundaries of clusters with opposite signs of @xmath5 are characterized by strong fluctuations .",
    "therefore , similarly to refs .",
    "@xcite we introduced the minimal absolute value of the polyakov loop attributed to the clusters , i.e. a cut - off @xmath8 .",
    "all space points @xmath9 with @xmath10 are attributed to `` auxiliary '' or `` confining '' vacuum which volume fraction is independent of the inverse lattice coupling @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the lattice coupling constant .",
    "the above definition allows us to define the monomers , the dimers , etc . as the clusters made of a corresponding number of  gauge spins \" of the same sign which are surrounded either by the clusters of opposite `` spin '' sign or by a vacuum @xcite",
    ". obviously , there are clusters of two types related to two signs of the local polyakov loop .",
    "we introduce a formal definition of anticlusters , if their sign coincides with the sign of the largest n - mer existing at a given lattice configuration .",
    "the largest anticluster is the",
    " anticluster droplet \" and the other n - mers ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) of the same sign correspond to the  gas of anticlusters \" .",
    "the clusters are defined to have an opposite sign of the polyakov loop and the largest of them is called the  cluster droplet \" .",

    "the described scheme of the ( anti)cluster identification was realized numerically .",
    "the polyakov loops were obtained at each spatial point of 3 + 1 dimensional lattice with the spatial and temporal extents @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . the simulations were performed for 13 values of the inverse lattice coupling @xmath17 inside the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the physical temperature @xmath19 is defined via two - loop @xmath17 dependence of the lattice spacing @xmath20 as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 points were distributed not uniformly .",
    "they were concentrated in the pt region which is of principal interest for this study .",
    "the identification of ( anti)clusters was performed for two values of the polyakov loop cut - off @xmath22 and @xmath14 . for most of @xmath17 values the number of ( anti)clusters of each size was averaged over the ensemble of 800 and 1600 gauge field lattice configurations .",
    "the distributions obtained in this way were the same within the statistical errors .",
    "for the gaseous anticlusters at three largest values of @xmath17 the statistics was increased to 2400 configurations .",
    "the right hand side vicinity of pt was also analyzed with such a statistics in order to exclude the effects of numerical fluctuations which we observed for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the typical size distributions of ( anti)clusters for @xmath14 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ivan_fig1 ] . for @xmath17 below the critical value @xmath25 in an infinite system @xcite the distributions of ( anti)clusters are identical due to existing global z(2 ) symmetry . if @xmath17 is even slightly above @xmath26 then the symmetry between ( anti)clusters breaks down ( the left panel of fig . [ ivan_fig1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the size of the cluster ( anticluster ) droplet decreases ( increases ) .",
    "it is remarkable , that the corresponding gaseous clusters behave contrary to their droplets .",
    "therefore , the deconfinement pt in su(2 ) gd can be considered as an evaporation of the cluster droplet into the gas of clusters and a simultaneous condensation of the gas of anticlusters into the anticluster droplet . for large values of @xmath17 ( the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ivan_fig1 ] ) the cluster droplet becomes indistinguishable from its gas whereas the size of anticluster droplet becomes comparable to the system size .",
    "also we found that the gas and liquid branches of anticluster distributions are always well separated from each other .     for several values of @xmath27 and for a few values of @xmath17 found by the 4-parametric fit of the ldm formula .",
    "all these results refer to the cut - off @xmath14 . ]",
    "[ fig3 ]    the found distributions closely resemble the ones discussed for the nuclear fragments and for the ising spin clusters @xcite . hence , we analyzed whether the liquid droplet formula ( ldf ) @xcite @xmath28 is able to reproduce the size distributions of clusters ( @xmath29 ) and anticlusters ( @xmath30 ) . here",
    "@xmath31 is the bulk part of free energy of k - mer , @xmath32 denotes its surface free energy with the surface proportional to @xmath33 , @xmath0 is the fisher topological constant and @xmath34 is the normalization factor . since the ldm is valid only for ( anti)clusters which are sufficiently large , then the question which has to be clarified first was a determination of the minimal size @xmath27 to which eq .",
    "( [ eqii ] ) can be applied .",
    "the standard procedure of @xmath35 minimization with respect to @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath0 and @xmath27 allowed us to answer this question .",
    "our analysis shows that the ldf is already able to describe the dimers .",
    "indeed , we found that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , whereas for @xmath40 we got @xmath41 which corresponds to the low quality of data description . within the statistical errors we found that @xmath0 is independent on @xmath17 for @xmath42 ( see fig .",

    "moreover , we found that @xmath43 both for clusters and for anticlusters , which agrees with the exactly solvable model of the nuclear liquid - gas pt @xcite and contradicts to the fdm @xcite .",
    "thus , from a four parametric fit of the ldf we found that @xmath42 and @xmath44 both for clusters and for anticlusters .    for fixed values @xmath42 and @xmath44 we performed a three parametric fit of the ( anti)cluster size distributions to define @xmath34 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 with high precision .",
    "the typical value of @xmath45 was obtained for any @xmath17 , which signals about high quality of the data description .",

    "it is seen that the behavior of the reduced surface tension coefficient drastically changes , if @xmath17 exceeds the critical value @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath47 this quantity is constant and it is identical for clusters and anticlusters , while @xmath48 monotonically decreases and @xmath49 monotonically increases with @xmath17 for @xmath50 .",
    "the qualitatively different behavior of @xmath48 and @xmath49 allows us to treat them as an order parameter of the deconfinement pt in su(2 ) gd . on the other hand ,",
    "the average value of polyakov loop @xmath51 is traditionally considered as an order parameter of the deconfinement pt in su(2 ) gd . in @xcite we demonstrated that @xmath51 is mainly defined by the largest ( anti)cluster droplets whose average size ( see fig .

    "we also explain the deconfinement pt as a special kind of the liquid - gas transition between two types of liquid whose behavior is drastically different in the region of broken global z(2 ) symmetry . above pt the cluster liquid droplet evaporates , whereas the anticluster liquid droplet condensates the accompanying gas of anticlusters .",

    "this result is in line with the exactly solvable model of the nuclear liquid - gas pt @xcite and disproves the fdm prediction that @xmath63 @xcite .",
