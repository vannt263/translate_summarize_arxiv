    "the dark states are pure entangled states of the two nanocantilevers . for pure states , it is possible to quantify entanglement using the _ participation ratio _",

    "two- and three - excitation subspaces we have @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively . although @xmath161 , only the dark state in the one - excitation subspace is a maximally entangled state of the two nanocantilevers .",
    "nonetheless , in higher excitation subspaces there is a finite degree of entanglement present between the two nanocantilevers .",
    "we have proposed a scheme to generate entanglement between two nanomechanical systems through indirect interactions mediated by an ultra cold gas of atoms .",
    "the excitation energy of the two - level atoms is assumed to have been tuned to coincide with the energy quantum of the fundamental flexural mode of the two identical cantilevers .",
    "hence single excitations have the same energy in the atomic system as in the cantilevers and we have studied the dynamics of systems with a total of one , two and three excitations present . in the presence of dissipation in the atomic gas ,",
    "the two nanocantilevers relax into a statistical mixture of various dark states of the system .",
    "this opens the possibility to achieve long - lived entangled states of nanomechanical systems which are only limited by the dephasing time of the cantilevers .",
    "the atomic decay channel is important for the creation of time independent entangled states , provided that the decay rate of the atoms is low enough to enable a strongly coupled regime and high enough so that the steady state is reached before the coherence of the cantilevers decays away .    with respect to the preparation of an initial state it has been shown in @xcite",
    "that if a two level system is coupled to a classical field and a quantum field , prepared in its vacuum state , and if the two coupling strengths can be tuned independently of each other then atom - field interactions can force the vacuum state of the field to an arbitrary superposition of the fock states .",
    "this can be used for the initial state preparation of the nanocantilevers .",
    "also , in a recent work @xcite a possibility of transferring also non - gaussian states from an optical field to a mechanical oscillator has been outlined .",
    "a challenging aspect of any scheme involving entanglement generation between `` macroscopic '' mechanical systems is the actual experimental detection of entanglement .",
    "a promising scheme suggested in @xcite employs a quantum non demolition ( qnd ) measurement of the excitation of a mechanical oscillator by using the anharmonic coupling between two beam bending modes , which uniquely shifts the resonant frequency of the readout oscillator .",
    "another recent proposal is to determine the wigner function of a mechanical resonator by coupling the vibrational mode of the oscillator to a three level `` detector '' atom , which in turn is coupled to a pair of optical fields , inducing raman transitions between its ground and excited state @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the probability for the `` detector '' atom to be found in the ground state is a direct measure of the wigner characteristic function of the nanomechanical oscillator as long as dissipation in the system can be kept under control .",
    "entanglement detection for nanomechanical systems is thus experimentally challenging , but may be possible using techniques such as these .",
