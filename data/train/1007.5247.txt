    "it was shown that maximum transmission through the array is reached precisely at the super - radiant transition .",
    "the transport properties of a @xmath0 sequence of potential barriers were analyzed with the aid of the energy - independent _ effective non - hermitian hamiltonian_. this approach produces excellent agreement with the exact ( numerical ) treatment of the problem for weak tunneling between the wells .    in this paper",
