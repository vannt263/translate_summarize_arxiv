    "note that only the morphology of the eddies at a given time differ , the developing instability remains of the same kind , i.e. a thin - shell - related instability  @xcite .",
    "in the situation of our slowly - moving supernova progenitors , the remnant is affected by thermal conduction in the sense that the channeled supernova shock wave interacting with the walls of the cavity encounters a more irregular and clumpy medium ( fig .  [ fig : snr_large_scale_2070]a ) .",
    "it changes neither the shape of the outflow along the direction of the progenitor nor the global remnant morphology , however , it may generate ring - like emission artefacts , e.g. by projection effect .",
    "note that heat conduction is in its turn sensitive to the ism magnetisation which makes it anisotropic  @xcite as it has been shown in several studies devoted to old supernova remnants  @xcite .    in the case of our fast - moving supernova progenitors , the absence of thermal transfers ( i ) slightly modify , as discussed above , the shape of the eddies constituting the pre - supernova circumstellar medium distribution and ( ii ) allows the ejecta interacting with the bow shock to cool independently of the rest of the gas during the radiative phase of the remnant .",
    "consequently , the fingers of the developing rayleigh - taylor instabilities become denser ( fig .",
