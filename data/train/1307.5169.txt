    "along years significant efforts have been devoted to determining the hadron spectrum with lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on the different methods and results .",
    "a crucial feature of the lattice qcd studies is that one must extrapolate from the finite box used in the lattice calculations to infinite space in order to obtain physical observables . to this aim , one of the tools most widely used is the lscher s approach @xcite . at the practical level ,",
    "the latter method was recently rederived in a simpler way in ref.@xcite by employing general expressions for two - body scattering from ref .",
    "it is worth stressing that the method of ref .",
    "@xcite keeps the relativistically covariant two - body propagator .",
    "this method has been applied in refs .",
    "@xcite to calculate physical observables from possible calculations of different hadronic processes in a finite box as well as associated errors .",
    "however , a common feature of refs .",
    "@xcite is that they do not take into account the finite size dependence of potentials from which the scattering in infinite volume is obtained .",
    "this simplification is based on the result of ref .",
    "@xcite that the volume dependence of the potentials is `` exponentially suppressed '' with the box volume . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effects of the finite size in the isoscalar and isotensor @xmath0 @xmath6-wave scattering channels were studied quantitatively .",
    "an estimation was given of the minimum box size of possible lattice calculations so that the errors coming from these finite size effects were negligible .    following a similar procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of finite volume for @xmath7 @xmath0 scattering in order to extract physical observables for infinite volume from lattice qcd .",
    "this channel is of special relevance since it has the quantum numbers of the resonance @xmath8 whose study in lattice qcd has attracted special attention in the last decade .",
    "several works have used lscher s method to extract physical observables in infinite volume from actual lattice qcd data @xcite .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to theoretically illustrate the improvement of using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite for determining @xmath0 scattering in the @xmath9 channel from finite box calculations over the standard lscher s method . in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential for the @xmath0 scattering in @xmath10 and @xmath11-wave was obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite which considered as dynamical input tree level diagrams from lowest order chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) with explicit exchange of vector resonances . in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential is not modified in the finite box and , hence , the finite volume effects come only from the discretization in the box of the unitarization loops . in the present work we use the amplitudes from the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) and another method based on an approximate algebraic solution to the n / d method that we refer as the @xmath12 in the following . in both cases",
    "the amplitudes include loops in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 channels , which indeed get modified in the finite volume .",
    "this provides two different volume dependent amplitudes for the isovector @xmath0 @xmath11-wave scattering .",
    "we can then study the impact of volume dependence from these amplitudes in the process of extracting physical observables in the infinite volume , like phase shifts , from scattering energy levels obtained in the finite box .",
    "the error made by neglecting possible volume dependence of the potential in the direct lscher s analysis of the data is discussed .",
    "for the study of the finite volume effects in @xmath0 interactions in the @xmath9 channel , we will consider two approaches , the @xmath12 method and the iam , whose dynamical input is obtained from the @xmath15 chiral amplitudes at @xmath16 .",

    "] these chiral amplitudes are discussed in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : amplitudes_p4 ] , whereas the amplitudes involving @xmath9 exchanges are considered in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : rhoamplitudes ] . in finite volume , since the loop integrals are replaced with sums over discrete momenta , these amplitudes are volume dependent .",
    "the finite volume effects on the amplitudes are treated in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : fin_vol ] . in subsecs .",
    "[ subsec : nd ] and [ subsec : iam ] we discuss the @xmath12 and the iam methods , respectively , and show how they make use of the one - loop perturbative chiral amplitudes discussed before .",
    "the amplitudes depend on some free parameters , that are fixed in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : fits ] by reproducing several sets of data .",
    "let us denote the different @xmath0 partial waves of isospin @xmath19 and angular momentum @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "these amplitudes are normalized such that : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cm momentum of each pion ( with mass @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is the partial wave phase shift . these amplitudes can be calculated perturbatively as the projection into angular momentum @xmath20 wave of the different isospin amplitudes @xmath26 , that are computed in @xmath15 chpt @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the @xmath31 contribution to this amplitude , and by @xmath32 its projection into the partial wave with angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "both the iam and the @xmath12 methods , as we shall see below , make use of the amplitudes @xmath32 to calculate the partial waves @xmath21 in a non - perturbative manner , in the sense that they resum the unitarity cut .",
    "( in what follows , the superscript @xmath33 is dropped to simplify notation . )",
    "the amplitude @xmath34 can be written in a generic way , for the different isospin channels , as : @xmath35 the functions @xmath36 above are polynomials of the mandelstam variables .",
    "in particular , the low energy constants ( lecs ) @xmath37 appear just in the term @xmath38 .. in the case of @xmath0 scattering , only the lecs with @xmath39 are involved . ] in eq .  , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the one and two  point one  loop functions , respectively , given by : @xmath42 where @xmath11 is the four  momentum entering the loop .",
    "whence , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eq .",
    "stem from the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29channel loops   with @xmath46 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "these functions are regularized through dimensional regularization .",
    "after the divergences and scale dependencies are absorbed in the lecs  @xcite , the loop function , denoted now @xmath47 , reads : @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , because of the regularization approach followed , we have @xmath50 .      from a broader point of view , one can include , together with the @xmath16 amplitudes explained so far , the contribution coming from resonance chpt @xcite , which start to contribute at one - loop order as well .",
    "for the problem discussed here , the relevant lagrangian is the one that incorporates exchanges of the @xmath9 meson field .",
    "this term involves , in our case , two free parameters , the bare @xmath9 mass , @xmath51 , and the coupling constant @xmath52 .",
    "this contribution is relevant in the @xmath12 method for the @xmath10 , @xmath53 channel , since the physical @xmath9 resonance is generated by dressing the bare @xmath9 pole with @xmath0 rescattering @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the @xmath9 exchanges in the @xmath28 and @xmath29channels for the @xmath54 @xmath0 @xmath6-wave channels which are also studied here for consistency .",
    "these exchanges cancel partially with the crossed channel @xmath0 loops @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the exchange of resonances has a large impact on the values of the lecs .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath9 resonance to these constants reads @xcite : @xmath55 since these contributions are already accounted for by the @xmath9-exchange amplitudes , we subtract them from the lecs appearing in the amplitudes to avoid double counting .",
    "this is the case when applying the unitarization scheme based on the n / d method , but not in the iam . in this latter method the physical @xmath9 is generated from the dynamics through the chpt @xmath56 lecs @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this makes a difference between the @xmath12 method and the iam , that will show up in the different finite volume effects predicted by each approach .",
    "this point is not a shortcoming of our study , but rather it will allow us to confront both methods , so that the differences between both are considered as an estimate for uncertainties .",
    "let us now discuss the modifications to the amplitudes explained so far when one considers the interactions in a finite cubic box of edge @xmath4 and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the chiral amplitude @xmath57 receives contribution from loop integrals that , in the finite volume case , are replaced with sums over the allowed ( quantized ) momenta , giving rise to @xmath58 , which is the finite volume version of the former .",
    "namely , these contribution arise from @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29channel loops , and from tadpole diagrams as well .",
    "note also that we write the amplitudes in terms of the physical pion mass @xmath24 and decay constant @xmath59 , and hence the @xmath16 contributions to them ( tadpole loop - functions ) are included as @xmath16 terms in the amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath60 . the @xmath16 contribution to the partial wave in the finite volume ,",
    "that we denote by @xmath61 , is calculated as @xmath62 with the replacement @xmath63 .",
    "this one is calculated from eq .  , but replacing the loop functions in eqs .   and with their finite volume counterparts , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "following the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite , the finite volume loop functions are obtained from the infinite volume ones as : @xmath66~,\\label{eq : loopfun_fin }   \\\\ &   \\widetilde h^d = h^d + { { \\nonumber}}\\\\ & \\lim_{q_\\textrm{max}\\to\\infty}\\bigg [    \\frac1{l^3}\\sum_{\\vec{q}_i}^{q_\\textrm{max } } \\frac1{2\\omega_{\\vec{q}_i } }    -\\int\\limits_{q <",

    "since the box breaks lorentz symmetry , the reference frame is fixed to the center of mass frame of the initial pions .",
    "for this reason we have used @xmath11 as the argument of @xmath64 in eq .   instead of @xmath68 .",
    "for the @xmath27channel loop case , where @xmath69 so that @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 as : @xmath72~,\\label{tonediff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and : @xmath73 let us note that @xmath71 depends solely on @xmath46 in this case . however , for the @xmath28channel loop , we have @xmath74 so that @xmath75 , and hence the integrand @xmath67 becomes : @xmath76 now , contrary to the @xmath27channel case , @xmath77 depends on @xmath78 , but also on @xmath79 and its relative orientation respect to the cubic lattice of allowed momenta in the box , @xmath80 .",
    "this dependence translates into a dependence on the scattering angle @xmath81 , present in @xmath82 , but also on the azimuthal angle @xmath83 , and this also happens with the @xmath29channel case .",
    "thus , when making the partial wave projections in finite volume , , @xmath84  . ] we should now also integrate on @xmath83 , @xmath85 being @xmath86 the legendre polynomial of order @xmath20 .    finally , the function @xmath65 can be computed using the poisson resummation formula ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , since @xmath87 , we find : @xmath88 being @xmath89 the bessel function .",
    "the @xmath27channel loops are responsible for the right  hand cut ( rhc ) , or unitarity cut , that stems from the loop function @xmath43 and it is the most important source of @xmath4 dependence in the amplitude .",
    "this @xmath4 dependence arising from the rhc is the one used by the lscher method to obtain phase shifts from the energy levels obtained in a finite volume . in particular , in the version of ref .",
    "@xcite , given a certain energy level @xmath90 on a finite box of size @xmath4 , the infinite volume amplitude is given by @xmath91 from where the phase shifts can be straightforwardly extracted . note that the @xmath92-matrix so calculated does not depend on any regularization procedure for the loop function @xmath93 since its inverse is the limit of the piece between brackets in eq .",
    "( for further discussion on eq .  , see ref .",
    ".   only takes into account the @xmath4dependence coming from the @xmath27channel loops .",
    "however , the tadpoles and the @xmath28 and @xmath29channel loops , which give rise to the left - hand cut ( lhc ) when projected into partial waves , give further dependence on @xmath4 ( polarization corrections in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that is neglected in eq .  .",
    "its effects are typically disregarded because they are exponentially suppressed @xcite .      from the exact @xmath2 method @xcite it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the lhc is neglected or treated perturbatively ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a two - body partial wave amplitude can be written in full generality as : @xmath94 where the loop function @xmath95 is given by a once - subtracted dispersion relation of eq .  ,",
    "@xmath96 here , @xmath97 is a subtraction constant , that depends on the renormalization scale @xmath98 , taken as @xmath99 .",
    "the kernel @xmath100 is calculated by matching its chiral expansion , @xmath101 , with the chiral amplitudes @xmath102 and @xmath103 , that is : @xmath104 where the ellipsis indicate @xmath105 and higher orders in the expansion .",
    "it results then : @xmath106 note that the kernel @xmath107 has no rhc , since @xmath62 contains the piece @xmath108 and then this cut cancels in the difference in eq .  .",
    "hence , the rhc stems solely from the denominator in eq .  .",
    "now , to calculate the amplitude in the finite volume , @xmath109 , we must replace @xmath100 with @xmath110 .",
    "since the @xmath111 term does not depend on @xmath4 , no replacement is needed on it , whereas we have : @xmath112 with @xmath113 given by an analogous expression to eq .   but with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath114 .",
    "notice that , according to the discussion above , the volume dependence of the @xmath27-channel loop does not affect the kernel @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the volume dependence in the amplitude @xmath109 enters through : ( i ) the kernel @xmath107 which volume dependence originates from tadpoles and @xmath28 and @xmath29 loop functions generating lhc , and ( ii ) denominator @xmath116 , that gives rise to the rhc , through the function @xmath113 .",
    "this is the most important source of volume dependence .",
    "finally , the energy levels @xmath90 within a box of edges of size @xmath4 are given by the poles of the amplitude @xmath117 , @xmath118 , that corresponds to the solution of the equation : @xmath119 one can then reobtain the infinite volume phase shifts from the finite volume energy levels obtained by using eq .   and quantify the effect of neglecting the @xmath4dependence in the kernel @xmath107 .      now , we consider the elastic iam @xcite .",
    "this method uses elastic unitarity and chpt @xcite to calculate the inverse of the @xmath0 scattering partial wave @xmath120 through a dispersion relation .    in the iam",
    ", one considers an auxiliary function , @xmath121 , its analytic structure being a rhc from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , a lhc from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , and possible poles coming from zeros of the @xmath92 function ( like adler zeros ) .",
    "hence , we can write a dispersion relation for @xmath126 as : @xmath127 the rhc integral can be evaluated exactly due to unitarity , whereas the subtraction constants can be evaluated with chpt , since they involve amplitudes or derivatives of them at @xmath128 , and so @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "the lhc is dominated by the low energy region , due to the three subtractions , and it is also dumped by an extra @xmath132 for physical values of @xmath27 . then , it can be evaluated using chpt to obtain @xmath133 . the pole contribution , @xmath134 , is formally @xmath105 and we neglect it ( this causes some technical problems in the subthreshold region around the adler zeros which can be easily solved , but they do not affect the description of scattering nor resonances , for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . taking into account all the above considerations we arrive at the simple iam formula , @xmath135 hence , the amplitude in the box is obtained as @xmath109 by replacing in eq .   the amplitude @xmath103 with @xmath61 .",
    "the energy levels @xmath90 are then given by the poles of the amplitude @xmath109 , that is , by the solution of the equation @xmath136 .",
    "as stated before , the infinite volume @xmath92-matrix can be reobtained , neglecting the left cut and tadpoles @xmath4-dependence , from eq .  .",
    "the partial wave amplitudes , calculated in the @xmath12 method and in the iam , depend on four lecs , @xmath137 , and , in the case of the @xmath12 method , also on the subtraction constant @xmath97 and the parameters related to the @xmath9 bare field , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these parameters are fixed by reproducing scattering data as well as lattice results . for @xmath138 ,",

    "this means that for points coming from the level 2 ( or higher ) the @xmath4dependence of the potential has a minor effect in the resolution of the `` inverse problem '' .",

    "this effect is mild for the @xmath12 , while it is rather strong in the case of the iam .",
    "the reason for this different behavior between both methods is that in the @xmath12 the @xmath9 meson is included as an explicit pole with fixed bare mass .",
    "the physical @xmath9 generates from the dressing of this bare field due to @xmath0 rescattering .",

    "this corresponds approximatly to energies below @xmath150 and to an @xmath4 value of about @xmath151 .",
    "this means that using lattice points from level 1 , one can only obtain the same results for both methods for the @xmath9 phase shifts for energies below @xmath150 . in order to get similar results for both methods for the right part of the @xmath9 resonance shape one must consider points in the second level for @xmath4 values between @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath12 and iam models considered in the present work are two sound models rooted in basic properties of strong interactions as unitarity , analyticity and chiral symmetry and have been rigorously and thoroughly tested in many processes in infinite volume . by considering the @xmath4dependence that stems from such models we conclude with some confidence that if one uses points obtained from the second level of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] in order to extract the @xmath9 meson , then it is safe to neglect such @xmath4dependence in the potential and proceed via standard lscher method or its version of @xcite to solve the inverse problem .",

    "the original type of kawarabayashi - suzuki - riazuddin - fayyazuddin ( ksrf ) relation @xcite predicts @xmath156 .",
    "this relation can also be derived from the high - energy constraint of the pion vector form factor at tree level @xcite . however , when the latter study is extended up to the one - loop level @xcite it gives rise to the relation @xmath157 that it is considered to be valid in the large @xmath158 .",
    "this modified ksrf - like relation was also confirmed in other contexts : @xmath0 scattering @xcite , radiative @xmath159 decays @xcite , extra - dimension model for @xmath0 scattering @xcite and within spectral - function sum rules and semi - local duality @xcite .",
    "we then consider quite reasonable to take that @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath59 and , from the @xmath4 dependence of the latter , to obtain that of @xmath52 .",
    "this extra @xmath4 dependence is now taken into account and reads @xmath160 one comment is in order here .",
    "we should note that the amplitudes involving @xmath9-exchange are already @xmath16 , and hence the above modification introduces terms of @xmath105 and higher in the evaluation of @xmath161 in eq .  .",
    "however , as argued above , it is of interest in order to identify sources of @xmath4 dependence in the resulting scattering amplitudes by using the @xmath12 method .",
    "next we discuss the results that stem by considering this additional volume dependence of the amplitude .",
    "the energy levels and phase shifts obtained now are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gvl ] .",
    "the upper panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : gvl](a ) , shows by the ( green ) dot - dashed lines the the new energy levels obtained . for comparison , we also display the original @xmath12 and iam results , already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , by the ( blue ) dashed and ( red ) solid lines , respectively .",
    "one can observe that the new energy levels are very similar to the previous ones for @xmath162 .",
    "however , the new @xmath154 energy level starts to be different from the original @xmath12 one for @xmath163 .",
    "indeed , for smaller values of @xmath4 the novel @xmath154 energy level even decreases for decreasing values of @xmath4 and tends to values near the bare @xmath9 mass ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath52 becomes very small for these small values of @xmath4 ( for example , @xmath165 is around @xmath166 , whereas @xmath167 ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the bare @xmath9 meson can only be felt for energy values very close to the bare @xmath9 mass .",
    "although the @xmath168 contribution to @xmath161 considered here is only partial , it may indicate that the approach is not valid for values of @xmath169 in the range @xmath170 .",
    "let us recall here that these @xmath4 values are far from the range @xmath171 , confirming our previous conclusion that this lower bound can be taken as safe in order to extract reliable @xmath0 phase shifts and information about the @xmath9 meson . in the bottom panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : gvl](b ) , we show by the dot - dashed lines the phase shifts obtained with the new energy levels , together with the original ones , already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , resulting from the iam ( solid lines ) and the @xmath12 method ( dashed lines ) . for each of these three models ,",
    "the phase shifts obtained with the energy levels @xmath154 and @xmath155 are shown by the blue and red lines , respectively . as expected ,",
    "the three approaches are rather similar for the @xmath155 level . the differences between the phase shifts calculated from the @xmath154 energy level obtained with the two @xmath12 results ( with and without volume dependence of @xmath52 ) are large for energy values around @xmath172 . the deviation of the new calculated phase shifts with respect to the original ones ( which were already close to the infinite volume phase shifts ) for this range of energies ( corresponding to values of @xmath169 in the range @xmath170 ) confirms the previous discussion on the large effects that stem from this energy range with low @xmath4 and that invalidates the use of eq .  . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement between the phase shifts calculated with the two versions of the @xmath12 method ( with and without volume dependence of the coupling @xmath52 ) supports the results obtained with energy levels that involve values of the volume @xmath171 .",
    "we have made a study of the @xmath0 scattering in the @xmath8 channel in a finite box .",
    "in particular , we have studied the effect of the exponentially suppressed @xmath4-dependence coming from tadpoles and crossed channel loops that is usually neglected when extracting physical quantities from lattice results in a finite volume via lscher approach or the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . to do so we have used two realistic models to describe @xmath0 scattering , the @xmath12 method and the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) .",
    "these approaches describe fairly well the scattering and the @xmath8 resonance in infinite volume and , when modified to describe the @xmath0 energy levels in a finite box , they also incorporate the suppressed @xmath4-dependence mentioned above .",
    "we obtain for each method the @xmath0 energy levels in a finite box as a function of the box size @xmath4 , and study when the lshcer approach or the method of ref .",
    "@xcite can be safely used to obtain the infinite volume phase shifts around the @xmath8 region .",
    "we conclude that if one uses lattice sizes @xmath173 , the exponentially suppressed @xmath4dependence is in fact numerically negligible , and the same results are obtained from the levels derived from either the @xmath12 method or the iam , which also agree with the infinite volume phase shifts . however , if the high energy part of the @xmath8 shape is to be reproduced from the first energy level , one needs to use @xmath4 values smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "then , the results from the @xmath12 and iam levels are quite different , which suggests that the neglected @xmath4dependence in this case might be numerically important also in lattice calculations , and the phase shifts obtained inaccurate .",
