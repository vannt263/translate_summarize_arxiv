    "it is generally believed that there exists a rich phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and baryon density , for instance , the deconfinement process from hadron gas to quark - gluon plasma , the transition from chiral symmetry breaking phase to the symmetry restoration phase@xcite , and the color superconductivity@xcite at low temperature and high baryon density .",
    "recently , the study on the qcd phase structure is extended to finite isospin density . the physical motivation to study isospin spontaneous breaking and the corresponding pion superfluidity",
    "is related to the investigation of compact stars , isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies . while there is not yet precise lattice result at finite baryon density due to the fermion sign problem@xcite , it is in principle no problem to do lattice simulation at finite isospin density@xcite .",
    "it is found@xcite that the critical isospin chemical potential for pion condensation is about the pion mass in the vacuum , @xmath2 . the qcd phase structure at finite isospin density is also investigated in many low energy effective models , such as chiral perturbation theory@xcite , ladder qcd@xcite , random matrix method@xcite , strong coupling lattice qcd@xcite and nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite .",
    "one of the models that enables us to see directly how the dynamic mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration operate is the njl model@xcite applied to quarks@xcite . within this model ,",
    "one can obtain the hadronic mass spectrum and the static properties of mesons remarkably well@xcite , and the chiral phase transition line@xcite in @xmath3 plane is very close to the one calculated with lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "recently , this model is also used to investigate the color superconductivity at moderate baryon density@xcite . in this letter",
    "we report our results on the phase structure of the general @xmath0 njl model with @xmath1 breaking term at finite isospin chemical potential . at small isospin chemical potential",
    ", we argue that there is only one chiral phase transition line in the @xmath3 plane@xcite . at isospin chemical potential larger than vacuum pion mass ,",
    "the ground state of the system is a bose - einstein condensate of charged pions@xcite .",
    "we start with the flavor @xmath0 njl model defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the current quark mass , @xmath6 the chemical potential matrix in flavor space , @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the baryon and isospin chemical potential , respectively , and the interaction part includes@xcite the normal four fermion couplings corresponding to scalar mesons @xmath10 and @xmath11 and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 excitations , and the t - hooft@xcite determinant term for @xmath1 breaking , @xmath14 + \\frac{k}{2}\\left[\\det\\bar{\\psi}(1+\\gamma_{5})\\psi+\\det\\bar{\\psi}(1-\\gamma_{5})\\psi\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}(g+k)\\left[(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^{2}+(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma_{5}\\vec{\\tau}\\psi)^{2}\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2}(g - k)\\left[(\\bar{\\psi}\\vec{\\tau}\\psi)^{2}+(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma_{5}\\psi)^{2}\\right]\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at zero isospin chemical potential @xmath15 , for @xmath16 and @xmath17 the lagrangian is invariant under @xmath18 transformations , but for @xmath19 , the symmetry is reduced to @xmath20 and the @xmath1 breaking leads to @xmath21 and @xmath22 mass splitting and @xmath23 and @xmath24 mass splitting . if @xmath25 , we come back to the standard njl model@xcite with only @xmath26 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "we introduce the quark condensates @xmath27 and the pion condensate @xmath28 where we have chosen the pion condensate to be real .",
    "the quark condensate and pion condensate are , respectively , the order parameters of chiral phase transition and pion superfluidity . in mean field approximation ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the system is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the inverse of the mean field quark propagator , in momentum space it reads @xmath31 with the effective quark masses @xmath32 the condensates @xmath33 and @xmath23 as functions of temperature and baryon and isospin chemical potentials are determined by the minimum thermodynamic potential , @xmath34 it is easy to see from the chemical potential matrix and the quark propagator matrix that for @xmath35 or @xmath15 the gap equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are symmetric , and one has @xmath38",
    "we now consider the qcd phase structure below the minimum isospin chemical potential @xmath40 for pion superfluidity .",
    "since the pion condensate is zero , there is only chiral phase structure in this region .",
    "it is well known that in absence of isospin chemical potential the chiral condensate jumps down suddenly at a critical baryon chemical potential , which indicates a first order phase transition . at both finite baryon and isospin chemical potential , in principle",
    "we have @xmath41 , they may jump down at the same critical baryon chemical potential or at two different critical points . in the case",
    "@xmath16 , the two gap equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 decouple and the two critical points do exist , and therefore , there are two chiral phase transition lines in @xmath3 plane at fixed isospin chemical potential , the interval between the two points is just @xmath42 .",
    "what is the effect of the @xmath1 breaking term on the qcd phase structure ? if @xmath43 , the two gap equations couple to each other and tend to a single phase transition . especially in chiral limit , one can clearly see that when one of the quark condensates becomes zero , the other one is forced to be zero for any coupling constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , there is only one chiral phase transition line at any @xmath45 in chiral limit . in real world with small current quark mass , numerical solution of the gap equations shows that if there exists a structure of two chiral phase transition lines depends the quantity @xmath46    in real world there are four parameters in the njl model , the current quark mass @xmath5 , the three - momentum cutoff @xmath47 , and the two coupling constants @xmath44 and @xmath48 . among them @xmath49 and the combination @xmath50 can be determined by fitting the chiral condensate @xmath21 , the pion mass @xmath51 and the pion decay constant @xmath52 in the vacuum . for @xmath53 mev@xmath54 , @xmath55 mev , and @xmath56 mev",
    ", one has @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 mev , and @xmath59 . to determine the two coupling constants separately or the ratio @xmath60",
    ", one needs to know the @xmath24- or @xmath22-meson properties in the vacuum . in the self - consistent mean field approximation",
    ", the @xmath61 mass @xmath62 can be calculated in random phase approximation(rpa)@xcite @xmath63 with polarization function @xmath64 defined as @xmath65.\\\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath60 can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 . combining with the above known parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 obtained and choosing @xmath68 mev , we have @xmath69 which is much larger than the critical value @xmath70 for the two - line structure at @xmath71 mev@xcite .",
    "in fact , for a wide mass region",
    "@xmath72 mev @xmath73 mev , we have @xmath74 , and there is no two - line structure .",
    "to fully answer the question if the two - line structure exists before the pion condensation happens , we consider the limit @xmath75 . in real world with @xmath76 and @xmath19 , with increasing coupling constant @xmath48 or the ratio @xmath60 the two lines approach to each other and finally coincide at about @xmath77 which is still less than the value @xmath78 calculated by fitting @xmath68 mev .",
    "therefore , the two - line structure disappears if we choose @xmath68 mev .",
    "in fact , for @xmath79 mev @xmath80 mev , we have @xmath81 and the two phase transition lines are cancelled in this wide mass region .",
    "when the @xmath24-meson mass is outside this region , the @xmath1 breaking term is not strong enough to cancel the two - line structure , but the two lines are already very close to each other . considering the relation between the @xmath61 mass and the number of flavors , @xmath82 , one can estimate the @xmath61 mass in the case of two flavors @xmath83 which is in the region where @xmath84 .",

    "different from normal rpa approach in vacuum and at finite temperature , the meson modes in the pion superfluid will mix with each other and the dispersion relations of each eigen modes are determined by @xmath94 where the polarization function matrix @xmath95 is defined as @xmath96 the polarization functions are defined as @xmath97\\ , \\ ] ] with the vertexes @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 . from detailed calculation",
