    "<S> our findings enable one to determine the number of measurements required to obtain a physical solution . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the frequently used complete sampling strategy results in a different , much wider distribution and thus more often in unphysical estimates . as the required number of measurements depends exponentially on the number of qubits , the goal to obtain a physical estimate @xmath15 for a larger number of qubits is an illusion . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the possible structure of @xmath15 allows a new ansatz for discriminating statistical effects from systematic ones or , vice versa , for analysing colored noise contributions . </S>",
    "<S> performing hypothesis tests gives a firm basis for the determination of a physical density matrix and thereby a new level of confidence in the tomography of multiqubit states .    _ </S>",
