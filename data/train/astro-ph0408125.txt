    "stellar discs have a finite size . in the extreme outer parts the stellar light distribution diminishes more steeply than the exponential decline over the main disc and drops to low values beyond the so - called truncation radius @xmath0 ( @xcite , @xcite , hereafter ks13 ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter gkw ; @xcite ) .",
    "this truncation or cut - off of the disc light is often directly visible in contour maps of edge - on spirals and usually occurs at a radius of 3 to 5 disc scalelengths @xcite , although stellar discs that extend to a much larger number of scalelengths are certainly known to exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the truncation is most easily found in edge - on spirals because of the line - of - sight projection and the associated higher surface brightness .    in less inclined spirals ,",
    "for which azimuthally averaged radial light profiles are routinely studied , the non - axisymmetric component ( e.g.  spiral structure , lopsidedness ) can smooth out a truncation present in the old disc .",
    "this effect was first noted by @xcite . for 16 face - on spirals ,",
    "of which 15 did not show any sign of a truncation in the azimuthally averaged light profile , he found that the three outermost isophotes were much more closely spaced than the inner ones , providing clear evidence for the truncation .",
    "the milky way disc probably also shows a truncation , with recent estimates of @xmath1 ranging from 1015 kpc based on near - infrared star counts @xcite and the near- and far - infrared sky survey of the _ cobe_/dirbe instrument @xcite .",
    "recently , wide - field surveys have also revealed truncations in the local group galaxies ngc 2403 @xcite and ngc 3109 @xcite .",
    "the origin of the truncation of the stellar disc is still unclear and could possibly result from a number of physical scenarios @xcite .",
    "for example , if there has been no major re - distribution of the disc angular momentum during its formation and evolution , the truncation may reflect the maximum specific angular momentum of the protogalaxy @xcite .",
    "this would imply that the hi extending beyond the stellar disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been accreted , and that the truncation is associated with a small drop in the rotation curve ( ks3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the truncation corresponds to the radius at which the gas density drops below a threshold density necessary for star formation ( @xcite ; ks3 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in (",
    "* hereafter kkg ) we fitted truncation radii to the photometry of 34 edge - on galaxies from the sample of @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria and properties of this sample are summarized in kkg ( sect . 2 and table  1 ) .",
    "the sample covers a large range in rotation velocity ( @xmath2 = 50400 km s@xmath3 ) and is dominated by spirals of intermediate- to late - type . of the 34 galaxies we found that at least 20 have truncated discs .",
    "the truncation radii @xmath1 have been listed in table 5 in kkg . here",
    "we further compare the observed truncation radii to those predicted by the scenarios proposed for the origin of the truncation , and specifically address the behaviour with disc surface brightness ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we show the distribution of @xmath4 versus scalelength in fig .  [",
    "fig : trunc2]a . for those galaxies for which no truncation was found ,",
    "the lower limit is shown ( arrows ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : trunc2]a appears to show a subtle increase in @xmath4 towards small scalelengths ; the average ratio for the spirals with @xmath5 4 kpc is 4.4 , more than one standard deviation higher than that of the entire sample .",
    "this increase of @xmath4 may be related to its decrease found at very large scalelengths by @xcite . however , the reality of this feature is not entirely clear considering the modest sample size and the selection effect against galaxies of small physical sizes and low surface brightness .",
    "we are , for example , still missing small low surface brightness galaxies , which may have entirely different @xmath6 .",
    "while our view of the distribution of @xmath6 is certainly obscured by this selection effect , additional information can be obtained from face - on samples .",
    "we have estimated a lower limit to @xmath1 for the spirals in the face - on sample of @xcite , a sample which is dominated by spirals of small scalelength . by taking the lowest contour in their _",
    "r_-band contour plots as a lower limit to @xmath1 , we find an average @xmath7 4.0@xmath81.1 ( 1@xmath9 ) .",
    "this lower limit and the tentative increase of @xmath6 towards small scalelength spirals suggest that the ratio of truncation radius to disc scalelength in small scalelength nearby spirals is at least four",
    ".    figure  [ fig : trunc2]b shows the dimensionless truncation radius versus the de - projected face - on central surface brightness ( corrected for galactic extinction as in @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath6 appears to be correlated with surface brightness in the sense that lower surface brightness discs tend to truncate at a smaller number of scalelengths .",
    "a spearman rank correlation test appears conclusive , yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.61 ( or a confidence level greater than 99% ) .",
    "however , the errors are substantial in many cases and not entirely random , so that the test could have given a false positive result .",
    "note that the face - on surface brightnesses are probably underestimated , by @xmath10 0.7 mag according to a comparison between the tully - fisher relations of edge - on and face - on spirals ( @xcite ; hereafter kkf ) .",
    "the large lower limits for eso 340-g08 and eso 555-g36 are puzzling .",
    "the discs of these spirals appear to be far more extended than the norm .",
    "figures  [ fig : trunc2]a & b combined suggest that in small scalelength , high surface brightness spirals the truncation occurs at at least four scalelengths .",
    "this is important , because small spirals ( @xmath11 4 kpc ) are the most numerous in the local universe ( @xcite ; @xcite , kkg ) . as another corollary , the range in face - on surface brightness among spirals is narrower at @xmath1 than at the disc centre .",
    "if the discs in the current sample are exponential out to @xmath1 then the distribution of _ i_-band face - on surface brightnesses at @xmath1 has an average of 25.3 mag arcsec@xmath12 and a 1@xmath9 scatter of 0.6 mag arcsec@xmath12 .",
    "this dispersion is considerably smaller than the 1.1 mag arcsec@xmath12 dispersion in the central surface brightness .",
    "this also implies that in the face - on view , the truncation is just as easily ( or laboriously ) detected in lsb as in hsb spirals .",
    "we can compare the observed trends to the predictions of the analytical collapse model of disc galaxy formation ( @xcite , hereafter dss97 ) .",
    "if protogalaxies are relatively sharp - edged , then the collapse theory also predicts the outermost radius of the baryonic disc @xcite .",
    "this radius corresponds to the material with the highest specific angular momentum in the protogalaxy . to quantify this prediction we calculated model surface density profiles using the method of dss97 for a range in spin parameter and total mass of the protogalaxy .",
    "we assume a constant baryonic mass fraction @xmath13 0.10 and a constant efficiency for turning the baryons into stars over the age of the disc at @xmath14 2 ( see kkf ) .",
    "the scalelengths were derived using a method similar to the ` marking - the - disc ' method @xcite , and the outermost radii were obtained by taking the radius at which the density drops to zero .",
    "the result is indicated by the cross - hatched region in figs .",
    "[ fig : trunc2 ] .    in the collapse theory , both the outermost radius and the scalelength of the baryonic proto - disc increase with the mass and angular momentum of the protogalaxy such that their ratio remains approximately constant at 34 .",
    "taking a different or non - constant baryon mass fraction does not significantly change this result .",
    "the predicted @xmath4 is slightly smaller than the ratio of 4.5 predicted by @xcite based on a comparison of the angular momentum distribution of an exponential disc with that of a uniformly rotating , uniform sphere with @xmath15 0.07 .",
    "although the prediction of the collapse model roughly coincides with the average observed @xmath6 , it can not explain the existence of discs which extend to a relatively large or a small number of scalelengths .",
    "in particular , it does not predict an increase of @xmath4 toward small scalelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trunc2]a ) , or a decrease towards low surface brightness discs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trunc2]b ) . taking",
    "a different halo density profile and/or angular momentum profile could change the value of @xmath4 , but not its constancy . including additional prescriptions for mass accretion ,",
    "star formation and supernova feedback can lead to @xmath4 ratios that do change as a function of central surface brightness , but with the opposite sign @xcite . perhaps taking a range in angular momentum profiles , as suggested by n - body simulations in the @xmath16cdm cosmology @xcite , or re - distributing the angular momentum during and/or after the collapse could solve the discrepancy .",
    "alternatively , the stellar disc truncation may be caused by the inhibition of widespread star formation below a critical gas surface density ( @xcite ; ks3 ; @xcite ) , _ if _ the corresponding critical radius is approximately constant over time .",
    "this star formation threshold is suspected to be related to the stability of the gas disc .",
    "recently , @xcite made a prediction for the threshold radius based on simulations of the thermal and ionization structure of the gaseous discs assembled in the galaxy formation model of @xcite . in these simulations",
    "the transition to the cold ism phase is responsible for the onset of local gravitational instability that triggers star formation .",
    "this transition to the cold phase is independent of the shape of the rotation curve and occurs at a critical gas surface density , which for reasonable values of the gas fraction , turbulence , metallicity and the uv radiation intensity attains values in the range @xmath17 310 pc@xmath12 @xcite . for a disc with an exponential surface density profile",
    ", he finds :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the disc mass ( gas and stars ) and @xmath20 is the mass scalelength .",
    "it is easy to show that when the gas mass is negligible this prediction reduces to :    @xmath21    with @xmath22 the stellar mass - to - light ratio and @xmath23 its central surface brightness ( linear units ) .     versus face - on central surface brightness for the _ v _ and _ r_-band results of pohlen for the sharply truncated disc model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the face - on surface brightnesses were calculated assuming a exponential vertical luminosity distribution . as in fig .",
    "1b , the cross - hatched region shows the prediction of the collapse model and the dotted line shows the prediction of the star - formation treshold model , with the except that here the @xmath22 for the threshold model is arbitrary.,width=264 ]    the predicted threshold radii according to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : trunc ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trunc2]a for three disc masses and schaye s ( @xcite ) fiducial critical surface density @xmath24 5.9 pc@xmath12 ( @xmath25 = 5.6 10@xmath26 cm@xmath12 ) .",
    "for the adopted disc masses , the threshold model brackets the observations .",
    "interestingly , the model predicts an increase in @xmath28 towards small scalelengths .",
    "discs with a higher central surface density form stars out to a larger radius in terms of scalelengths before reaching the critical density .",
    "since , for constant total disc mass , a higher surface density disc has a smaller scalelength , it follows that smaller scalelength discs have larger @xmath28 .",
    "this anti - correlation , which is similar to the observed trend in the @xcite sample @xcite , is also in accordance with the present observations .",
    "motivated by the observation that the gas fraction in the galaxies is small ( @xcite , hereafter kkb ) , we show eqn .",
    "[ eqn : trunc_nogas ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : trunc2]b assuming @xmath29 5.9 pc@xmath12 and @xmath30 2 ( constant among galaxies ) .",
    "lower surface brightness discs are predicted to be less extended , with a slope in agreement with the observed trend .",
    "the match is better if we take into account that the inferred disc central surface brightnesses are fainter by about 0.7 magnitudes compared to their face - on counterparts ( kkf ) .",
    "the scatter and outliers may be explained as being due to a non - constancy in @xmath31 , e.g.  due to a varying uv radiation intensity or metallicity , or due to a variation of @xmath22 .",
    "altogether , the observations are consistent with a ` critical surface brightness ' in the range @xmath32 1.54 l@xmath33 pc@xmath12 .",
    "saying it differently , for @xmath24 5.9 pc@xmath12 the stellar mass - to - light ratio is @xmath30 41.5 m@xmath34/l@xmath33 .",
    "the lower part of this range is reasonable , both from the perspective of stellar population synthesis @xcite and observations of the stellar velocity dispersions in galaxy discs @xcite .",
    "both models can also be compared to the truncation analysis performed by @xcite in the _ v _ and the _ r _ bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pohlen ] ) .",
    "although obtained using a different method , these data show a trend very similar to our _ i_-band result ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trunc2 ] ) and to the star - formation treshold model ( dotted line ) .",
    "lower surface brightness discs tend to be less extended in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "it has long been known that viscosity driven angular momentum re - distribution within a star - forming gas disc may drive the resulting stellar disc towards an exponential profile @xcite .",
    "depending on the details of star formation , this process may yield a stellar disc with a well - defined edge that advances radially outward with time @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the theory has not yet been explicitly investigated with respect to this truncation radius .",
    "the theory of stochastic self - propagating star formation predicts @xmath4 = 4 @xcite for flat rotation curves .",
    "this prediction is similar to that of the collapse model , leading to the same difficulties of predicting no dependence on surface brightness .",
    "at least 20 galaxies in our sample of 34 have truncated stellar discs , displaying a tight relation between disc scalelength and truncation radius .",
    "the stellar disc edge seems to occur at a larger number of scalelengths in galaxies with a smaller scalelength , in agreement with the decrease of @xmath6 towards large scalelengths reported by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we observe a tentative correlation between the ratio @xmath4 and the de - projected face - on central surface brightness of the disc .",
    "these observations appear to have two important implications .",
    "first , high surface brightness spirals with small scalelengths , which are the most numerous spirals in the local universe @xcite , have an @xmath4 of at least four .",
    "secondly , the face - on disc surface brightness at the truncation radius is roughly constant among galaxies .",
    "the observed truncation radii were compared to the predictions of several theories proposed for its origin .",
    "the data are best reproduced by the constant star - formation threshold model for the truncation ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this model is able to match the correlation between @xmath6 and surface brightness for reasonable stellar mass - to - light ratios . the collapse model for disc galaxy formation ( @xcite ; dss97 ) , in which the truncation corresponds to the maximum angular momentum in the proto - galaxy before disc collapse with detailed conservation of angular momentum , provides a significantly poorer match to the observations .",
    "this model would require some amount of re - distribution of angular momentum during and/or after the collapse .",
    "we thank the referee for comments and suggestions ."
