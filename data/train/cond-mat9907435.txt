    "<S> a spin - glass compound , la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , shows quasi - three - dimensional magnetic ordering below @xmath340 k. a remarkable feature is that the magnetic correlation length along the orthorhombic @xmath4 axis is much longer than that along the @xmath5 axis , suggesting that the spin structure is closely related to the diagonal stripe structure . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - glass state can be expressed as a random freezing of quasi - three - dimensional spin clusters with anisotropic spin correlations ( @xmath6  , @xmath7  , and @xmath8   at 1.6 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the new magnetic state is important as an intermediate phase between the three - dimensional antiferromagnetic ordered phase in la@xmath9cuo@xmath2 and the incommensurate phase in la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath2 in which the positions of the incommensurate peaks are rotated by 45@xmath12 in reciprocal space about ( @xmath13,@xmath13 ) from those observed in the superconducting la@xmath9cuo@xmath2 compounds . </S>"
