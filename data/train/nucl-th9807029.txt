    "ground states of deformed exotic nuclei , unstable isotopes with extreme isospin values , display many interesting and unique properties .",
    "the description of observed phenomena , as well as the prediction of new and unexpected properties , present an exciting challenge for modern theoretical advances . for neutron - rich nuclei , a fascinating example of the modification of the effective single - nucleon potential",
    "is the observed suppression of shell effects , the disappearance of spherical magic numbers , and the resulting onset of deformation and shape coexistence .",
    "fine examples are @xmath3 mg ( extreme quadrupole deformation ) and @xmath4s ( shape coexistence ) .",
    "isovector quadrupole deformations are expected at the neutron drip - lines , and possible low - energy collective isovector modes have been predicted .",
    "a very interesting phenomenon is a possible formation of deformed halo structures in weakly bound nuclei . in much heavier neutron - rich systems ,",
    "the modification of shell structure could produce an enhancement of stability for superheavy elements @xmath5 .",
    "proton - rich nuclei present the opportunity to study the structure of systems beyond the drip - line .",
    "the phenomenon of ground - state proton radioactivity is determined by a delicate interplay between the coulomb and centrifugal terms of the effective potential .",
    "proton decay rates indicate that the region @xmath6 contains strongly deformed nuclei at the drip - lines .",
    "the lifetimes of deformed proton emitters provide direct information on the shape of the nucleus .    and while an impressive amount of experimental data on deformed exotic nuclei has been published recently ,",
    "relatively few pertinent theoretical studies have been reported .",
    "for relatively light exotic nuclei , as for example @xmath3 mg , shell model predictions for the onset of deformation and shape coexistence have been remarkably successful .",
    "however for medium - heavy and heavy systems , the only viable approach at present are large scale self - consistent mean - field calculations ( hartree - fock , hartree - fock - bogoliubov , relativistic mean - field ) .",
    "the problem is of course that , in addition to the self - consistent mean - field potential , pairing correlations have to be included in order to describe ground - state properties of open - shell nuclei . and",
    "while for strongly bound systems pairing can be included in the simple bcs scheme in the valence shell , exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values require a careful treatment of the asymptotic part of the nucleonic densities , and therefore a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations .",
    "the nonrelativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) and relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) models have been very successfully applied in the description of a variety of nuclear structure phenomena in spherical exotic nuclei on both sides of the valley of @xmath7- stability . for deformed exotic nuclei",
    "however , so far pairing has been only described in the bcs approximation .",
    "the bcs scheme presents only a poor approximation for nuclei with small separation energies , i.e. with the fermi level close to the particle continuum .",
    "the inclusion of deformation in hfb or rhb models with finite range pairing still presents considerable difficulties , and it has not been possible yet to obtain reliable results in coordinate space calculations . in the present work we report on the first application of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory with finite range pairing interaction to the structure of deformed nuclei in the n=28 region of neutron - rich nuclei .    in the framework of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model , the ground state of a nucleus @xmath8 is represented by the product of independent single - quasiparticle states .",
    "these states are eigenvectors of the generalized single - nucleon hamiltonian which contains two average potentials : the self - consistent mean - field @xmath9 which encloses all the long range particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) correlations , and a pairing field @xmath10 which sums up the particle - particle ( _ pp _ ) correlations .",
    "the single - quasiparticle equations result from the variation of the energy functional with respect to the hermitian density matrix @xmath11 and the antisymmetric pairing tensor @xmath12 .",
    "the relativistic model was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the hartree approximation for the self - consistent mean field ,",
    "the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) equations read @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the nucleon mass and @xmath15 is the single - nucleon dirac hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath16 the chemical potential @xmath17 has to be determined by the particle number subsidiary condition in order that the expectation value of the particle number operator in the ground state equals the number of nucleons .",
    "the column vectors denote the quasi - particle spinors and @xmath18 are the quasi - particle energies .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian contains the mean - field potentials of the isoscalar scalar @xmath19-meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath20-meson , the isovector vector @xmath11-meson , as well as the electrostatic potential .",
    "the rhb equations have to be solved self - consistently with potentials determined in the mean - field approximation from solutions of klein - gordon equations .",
    "the equation for the sigma meson contains the non - linear @xmath19 self - interaction terms . because of charge conservation only the third component of the isovector @xmath11-meson contributes .",
    "the source terms for the klein - gordon equations are calculated in the _ no - sea _ approximation . in the present version of the model",
    "we do not perform angular momentum or particle number projection .    the pairing field @xmath21 in ( [ equ.2.2 ] )",
    "is an integral operator with the kernel @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote quantum numbers that specify the dirac indices of the spinors , @xmath24 are matrix elements of a general relativistic two - body pairing interaction , and the pairing tensor is defined @xmath25 in the applications of the rhb theory to spherical nuclei  @xcite we have used a phenomenological non relativistic interaction in the pairing channel , the pairing part of the gogny force @xmath26 with the set d1s @xcite for the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "this force has been very carefully adjusted to the pairing properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table .",
    "in particular , the basic advantage of the gogny force is the finite range , which automatically guarantees a proper cut - off in momentum space . the fact that it is a non - relativistic interaction has negligible influence on the results of rhb calculations .",
    "of course , in order to have a consistent formulation of the model , the matrix elements in the pairing channel @xmath33 should be derived as a one - meson exchange interaction by eliminating the mesonic degrees of freedom in the model lagrangian  @xcite . however , although recently results have been reported in applications to nuclear matter , a microscopic and fully relativistic pairing force , derived starting from the lagrangian of quantum hadrodynamics , still can not be applied to nuclei . therefore also in the present calculations we use the effective gogny interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "the eigensolutions of eq .",
    "( [ equ.2.2 ] ) form a set of orthogonal and normalized single quasi - particle states .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are the single quasi - particle energies .",
    "the self - consistent iteration procedure is performed in the basis of quasi - particle states .",
    "the resulting quasi - particle eigenspectrum is then transformed into the canonical basis of single - particle states , in which the rhb ground - state takes the bcs form .",
    "the transformation determines the energies and occupation probabilities of the canonical states .",
    "the self - consistent solution of the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov integro - differential eigenvalue equations and klein - gordon equations for the meson fields determines the nuclear ground state . for systems with spherical symmetry , i.e. single closed - shell nuclei ,",
    "the coupled system of equations has been solved using finite element methods in coordinate space @xcite , and by expansion in a basis of spherical harmonic oscillator  @xcite . for deformed nuclei the present version of the model",
    "does not include solutions in coordinate space .",
    "the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov equations and the equations for the meson fields are solved by expanding the nucleon spinors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the meson fields in terms of the eigenfunctions of a deformed axially symmetric oscillator potential  @xcite . in the present calculations the number of oscillator shells in the expansion is 12 for fermion wave functions , and 20 for the meson fields .",
    "of course for nuclei at the drip - lines , solutions in configurational representation might not provide an accurate description of properties that crucially depend on the spatial extension of nucleon densities , as for example nuclear radii . in the present study we are particularly interested in the deformed n=28 region : shell effects and shape coexistence phenomena . for a description of general trends",
    "coordinate space solutions are not essential , solutions in the oscillator basis should present a pertinent approximation .",
    "the region of neutron - rich @xmath36 nuclei presents many interesting phenomena : the average nucleonic potential is modified , shell effects are suppressed , large quadrupole deformations are observed as well as shape coexistence , isovector quadrupole deformations are predicted at drip - lines .",
    "the detailed knowledge of the microscopic structure of these nuclei is also essential for a correct description of the nucleosynthesis of the heavy ca , ti and cr isotopes . in the present application of the rhb theory we study the structure of exotic neutron rich - nuclei with @xmath37 , and in particular the light @xmath1 nuclei .",
    "we are interested in the influence of the spherical shell @xmath1 on the structure of nuclei below @xmath38ca , in deformation effects that result from the @xmath39 core breaking , and in shape coexistence phenomena predicted for these @xmath40-soft nuclei .",
    "the structure of exotic neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath36 has been extensively studied by werner et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the self - consistent mean - field theory : skyrme hartree - fock model and relativistic mean - field approach .",
    "skyrme - hf calculations were performed by discretizing the energy functional on a three - dimensional cartesian spline collocation lattice .",
    "the skyrme interaction siii  @xcite was used . for the rmf model the dirac equation for the baryons and the klein - gordon equations for the meson fields",
    "were solved using the basis expansion methods .",
    "the nl - sh parameter set  @xcite was used for the mean - field lagrangian . in both models the pairing correlations were included using the bcs formalism in the constant gap approximation with a strongly reduced pairing interaction .",
    "hf and rmf results were compared with the predictions of the finite - range droplet ( frdm ) and the extended thomas - fermi with strutinsky integral ( etfsi ) mass models , as well as with available experimental data . in particular , the onset of deformations around @xmath1 , the stability of the heaviest si , s , ar and ca isotopes , and the isovector deformations were investigated .",
    "calculations confirmed strong deformation effects caused by the the @xmath39 core breaking , especially in the rmf model .",
    "almost all deformed nuclei were found to be @xmath40-soft , with the deformation dependence of the single - particle spectrum favoring prolate shapes for @xmath41 and oblate for @xmath42 .",
    "the results obtained with the two models , hf and rmf , were found to be similar , although also important differences were calculated .",
    "for example , the equilibrium shape of the @xmath1 nucleus @xmath4s .",
    "rmf calculations predict a well deformed prolate ground state with @xmath43 for this nucleus , while according to the hf model , @xmath4s is @xmath40-soft with a small quadrupole deformation @xmath44 .",
    "the frdm and etfsi models predict spherical and oblate ( @xmath45 ) ground states , respectively .",
    "another detailed analysis of the ground - state properties of nuclei in the light mass region @xmath46 in the framework of the rmf approach is reported in ref .",
    "the calculations were also performed in an axially deformed configuration using the nl - sh effective interaction . pairing was included in the bcs approximation , but a somewhat different prescription was used to calculate the neutron and proton pairing gaps in regions where nuclear masses were not known  @xcite .",
    "nuclei at the stability line were considered , as well as those close to the proton and neutron drip - lines .",
    "results of calculations were compared with available empirical data and predictions of mass models .",
    "a very interesting result is the predicted ground - state deformation for @xmath4s : oblate ( @xmath47 ) , with a highly prolate shape ( @xmath48 ) about 30 kev above the ground state .",
    "this result is at variance with the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , although in both cases the same effective interaction was used for the mean - field lagrangian .",
    "the pairing gaps used in the two calculations however were different .",
    "therefore it appears that , for nuclei which are very @xmath40-soft , the pairing interaction determines the shape transition to the deformed intruder configurations .",
    "results of skyrme - hf and rmf calculations clearly indicate that mean - field and pairing correlations should be described in a unified self - consistent framework : the nonrelativistic hartree - fock bogoliubov theory  @xcite or the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model that was described in the previous section .",
    "only fully self - consistent hfb or rhb models correctly describe the virtual scattering of nucleonic pairs from bound states to the positive energy particle continuum  @xcite .",
    "the correct representation of pairing correlations is an essential ingredient for microscopic models of the structure of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the input parameters for our model are the coupling constants and masses for the effective mean - field lagrangian , and the effective interaction in the pairing channel . in the present calculation we use the nl3 effective interaction  @xcite for the rmf lagrangian .",
    "we have used the nl3 force in most of the applications of rhb theory to spherical nuclei : in the analysis of light neutron - rich nuclei in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the study of ground - state properties of ni and sn isotopes @xcite , and in the description of proton - rich nuclei with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "properties calculated with nl3 indicate that this is probably the best rmf effective interaction so far , both for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath7-stability .",
    "nl3 has also been used in calculations of binding energies and deformation parameters of rare - earth nuclei  @xcite . for the pairing field",
    "we employ the pairing part of the gogny interaction , with the parameter set d1s @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figa ] the two - neutron separation energies are plotted @xmath51 for the even - even nuclei @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the values that correspond to the self - consistent rhb ground - states ( symbols connected by lines ) are compared with experimental data and extrapolated values from ref .",
    "@xcite ( filled symbols ) . except for mg and si , the nuclei that we consider are not at the drip - lines .",
    "the theoretical values reproduce in detail the experimental separation energies , except for @xmath38cr . in general",
    "we have found that rhb model binding energies are in very good agreement with experimental data when one of the shells ( proton or neutron ) is closed , or when valence protons and neutrons occupy different major shells ( i.e. below and above @xmath54 and/or @xmath55 ) .",
    "the differences are more pronounced when both protons and neutrons occupy the same major shell , and especially for the @xmath56 nuclei . for these nuclei",
    "additional correlations should be taken into account , and in particular proton - neutron pairing could have a strong influence on the masses .",
    "proton - neutron short - range correlations are not included in our model .    in fig .",
    "[ figb ] the calculated neutron radii are displayed .",
    "the model of course predicts an increase of the calculated radii with the number of neutrons .",
    "it is interesting however that cr , ti , ca , ar , and to a certain extent s isotopes , display very similar neutron radii in this region . only for the two more exotic chains of si and mg isotopes , i.e. more neutron - rich , a substantial increase of the calculated radii is observed . very important for our present investigation",
    "is the effect that the @xmath57 spherical shell closure produces on the neutron radii of cr , ti and ca isotopes . on the other hand , no effect of shell closure",
    "is observed for s , si and mg .",

    "the predicted mass quadrupole deformations for the ground states of @xmath1 nuclei are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
