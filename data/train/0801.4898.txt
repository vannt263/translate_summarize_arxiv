    "a promising technology for the implementation of quantum computation ( qc ) involves the storage of quantum information in the spin of electrons in quantum dots ( qds ) .",
    "the key requirement is that the lifetime of the spins is long compared with the time required for the operation of logic gates .",
    "this has motivated the development of dots in silicon , where spin - orbit coupling is weak and isotopic enrichment can eliminate hyperfine coupling ( hc ) .  indeed",
    ", recent experiments demonstrate the presence of long - lived spin states in silicon qds @xcite .  understanding the processes that relax spins can point to strategies for minimizing relaxation and coherence times , thereby improving coherent control of quantum systems .  in the case of electron spins embedded in semiconductor nanostructures , the relaxation properties",
    "are strongly affected by the regime of operation .",
    "thus it is important to identify the dominant sources of fluctuations in these systems , the mechanisms by which they couple to the spins , and to analyze the non - equilibrium decay laws in different regimes of external fields .",
    "considerable theoretical work has been performed on lifetimes for single - electron spin flip @xmath0 and dephasing @xmath1 for gaas khaetskii1,woods , golovach and for si @xcite .  in gaas",
    "these times have been measured .",
    "single - spin values for @xmath0 of about 0.5 ms at a field of 10 t up to 170 ms at 1.75 t were obtained @xcite , while for @xmath1 one finds a value of about 1 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a qubit consisting of the singlet and triplet states of a two - electron system is also a proposal for qc .",
    "the singlet - triplet lifetime has been studied in gaas @xcite .  in particular , hanson et al .",
    "found @xmath0 for the singlet - triplet transition in a two - electron gaas dot to be 2.6 ms at b=0.02 t.  we shall call this @xmath3  extensive theoretical work has been done for @xmath4 in gaas @xcite and our methods are similar to those found in these references .     in this paper",
    "we study the relaxation process for a doubly - occupied si qd in an excited ( triplet ) state to the ground ( singlet ) state , focusing on the computation of @xmath5 .",
    "our main motivation is to understand transport through double quantum dots .",
    "thus we are concerned with lateral dots defined by gates in strained silicon quantum wells .",
    "such dots have a two - fold valley degeneracy as well as spin degeneracy , but we will deal here with dots where the valley splitting is large compared with the first orbital excitation energy .  we will focus on natural si with a 4% concentration of @xmath6si nuclei , since this is the material on which experiments have been performed , but we comment on isotopically enriched si below .",
    "we assume the levels to be ordered as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : levels ] : the relevant energy scales are then the exchange , @xmath7 , and the difference between the ground singlet and the first triplet , @xmath8 , where the triplet is formed with a higher energy orbital , as depicted in fig .",
    "fig : levels(a ) .",
    "the dominant mechanism available in the absence of an external magnetic field is the hyperfine coupling with nuclei saykin , khaetskii via a virtual state @xcite ( left arrows of fig .",
    "fig : levels b ) .",
    "hc can not cause a direct @xmath9 transition because the nuclei can not absorb the energy .",
    "so the change in energy of the electron spin must be accompanied by the emission of a phonon falko , nazarov , abalmassov .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction mixes thus different orbital states via a deformation potential in this process , while the spin - flip is provided by the hc .",
    "this is the dominant process at zero applied magnetic field .",
    "a second relaxation channel is through spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",
    "so coupling mixes different spin states through the _ rashba _ so coupling @xcite .",
    "this leads to a non - vanishing matrix element for the phonon - assisted transition between a singlet and a triplet state _ in the absence of time - reversal symmetry _ ( right of fig .",
    "fig : levels ) leading to an increase in the relaxation rate , @xmath10 as the field is increased .",
    "our aim here is to compute the singlet - triplet relaxation rates due to these two mechanisms as a function of external field .",
    "we outline the method in the following section , and justify the approximations that are made .  we then present results and discussion .",
    "we consider first the case of low fields .  for reasons to be discussed below , we may neglect the spin - orbit coupling and the hamiltonian is written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 contains the confining potential of the qd and @xmath13 .  here",
    "@xmath14 corresponds to the electron - phonon coupling ( which conserves spin ) , and @xmath15 is the hyperfine coupling that causes spin mixing in the dot .  the confining potential is taken as parabolic with circular symmetry .",
    "we do not consider the coulomb interaction explicitly in the hamiltonian , as was done , for example , by golovach _",
    "@xcite , whose main interest was in the regime close to the singlet - triplet crossing . instead the interaction is included phenomenologically through a parameter @xmath16 , the singlet - triplet splitting .",
    "this is a crude form of mean field theory , but is reasonable as long as we are far from the singlet - triplet crossing point .",
    "far from this point there are no energy denominators that depend sensitively on the interaction strength , and matrix elements depend smoothly on the strength .    for the purpose of this paper ( qd formed in a bi - axially strained",
    "quantum well grown along the @xmath17-axis ) , we consider the lowest electric subband , so that the wavefunction @xmath18 in the @xmath17-direction is fixed .",
    "we utilize the fock - darwin ( fd ) states for the lateral dimensions @xmath19 to construct our wavefunctions , @xmath20 , that diagonalize @xmath12 .  for these states ,",

    "this is slightly simpler than the corresponding hamiltonian in gaas because of the absence of the piezoelectric coupling in ( centrosymmetric ) si .    next , we evaluate the spin - flip matrix element given by @xmath47 , which is provided , at low magnetic fields , by the bath of nuclear spins of the @xmath6si isotope saykin . accordingly , we consider a contact hamiltonian , @xmath48where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52)denote the spin and position of the @xmath53th electron ( @xmath54th nuclei ) , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are hyperfine coupling constants . inserting eq .",

    "this is consistent with the simple picture that the relaxation rate is proportional to the mean - square fluctuations in the random hyperfine field .",
    "formulas for spin relaxation rates due to hyperfine coupling that give an apparent proportionality to @xmath78 are common in the literature , and have given rise to the incorrect notion that some sort of motional narrowing is at work .",
    "this is not possible , since the fluctuations in the nuclear spin system are slow .  in any case",
    "the rate must vanish as @xmath79  these formulas are correct , but they generally involve other parameters that actually vary with @xmath80    fig .",
    "[ fig : st ] represents @xmath81 obtained as described in eq .",

    "the triplet @xmath98and singlet @xmath99 levels are strongly mixed by the hyperfine interaction and the phonon density of states increases as a function of level separations . in the limit @xmath100=0 , the rate is given by phonon emission , which we found to be of the order of 10@xmath101 s@xmath102 .",
    "thus @xmath103 appears very small as @xmath104 0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : st ] , but it is not zero .  at large @xmath95 spin mixing is lessened because there is an energy denominator and phonon relaxation is then suppressed by spin conservation .",
    "the calculations are obviously consistent with the observed lower bound of   @xmath105 @xmath2 given in ref .",
    "it is expected that more stringent bounds , hopefully also upper bounds , will be available soon .",
    "we now move to the case of finite applied magnetic field @xmath106 .",
    "we first take the the field along the growth direction ( perpendicular to the 2-deg ) : @xmath107  this allows a direct @xmath9 transition to occur in the presence of a rashba so coupling @xcite .",
    "the rashba field is a consequence of structural inversion asymmetry sobook in the heterostructure .",
    "note that no bulk inversion asymmetry needs to be considered in a centrosymmetric crystal like si .",

    "notice that @xmath115 is zero if @xmath116 .",

    "note that the behaviour of @xmath5 here is different to the much studied gaas - based devices @xcite because of the nature of spin - orbit coupling and electron - phonon coupling in non - centrosymmetric materials : the bia is absent and there are no piezo - phonons , also avoided crossings of the singlet and triplet energy level does not occur for the magnetic fields considered here , giving a monotonous behaviour .",
    "there are several ways to measure @xmath146 .  in single - dot systems , this can be realized using a single pulse @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may use the following sequence : in the first phase , the state can be prepared so that only one electron is present in the qd , and in the next phase , the triplet would be available for conductance , unless it relaxes to the singlet .",
    "measurement of the current for different values of the pulse duration then gives a direct method to determine @xmath147 .",
    "the latter experiment has been performed in gaas @xcite . in double - dot experiments , @xmath146 is one of the parameters in the rate equations that determine the measured current , so these experiments also provide an avenue for the determination of the singlet - triplet lifetime @xcite .",

    "it is also possible to lengthen @xmath148 by the use of isotopically enriched si , i.e. , pure @xmath149si .",
    "this would eliminate the hyperfine mechanism but it would not get rid of spin relaxation entirely , as higher - order effects of soc are still present even at @xmath116 .  however , these effects are quite small in si",
    ".  it seems likely that other effects such as flux noise will be the limiting factor in isotopically enriched si .    in summary , we have calculated the dominant rates for phonon - assisted triplet - singlet relaxation of a silicon quantum dot .",
