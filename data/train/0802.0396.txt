    "quantum phase transitions in ultracold atoms provide important insights into the behaviour of matter at very low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "an important example of this class of transitions is the transition from a superfluid(sf ) to a mott insulator(mi ) which has been observed in cold bosonic atoms in @xmath3 optical lattices  @xcite as predicted by jaksch _",
    "subsequently , this transition has been observed in a @xmath4 optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of this transition have been carried out by pai _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "an important question to address is how do the characteristics of this transition alter in going from one to two dimensions . in coupled bosonic chains",
    ", competition exists between the ratio of atomic interactions to the intra - chain hopping and the inter - chain hopping . a large value of the former favors a mott insulator state overcoming the effect of the inter - chain hopping while if the latter dominates it would tend to delocalize the bosons and drive the system to a superfluid state .",
    "it is not practical to perform numerical studies for the above mentioned transitions in a very large number of coupled chains , so one must restrict to a finite number of such chains .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the effect of the inter - chain hopping on the sf - mi transition for a bosonic ladder consisting of two coupled chains .",
    "although a substantial amount of theoretical and numerical work has been done in this direction for the case of spin - less fermionic ladders and spin ladders @xcite , no work has been done to our knowledge for the bosonic ladders except a recent work using the bosonization method .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the bosonic ladder(as shown in fig.[fig : fig1])is given by @xmath5 in this model ( [ eq : ham ] ) @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) represents bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator for the site @xmath8 of the chain with index @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the intra - chain hopping amplitude between the nearest neighboring sites of chain @xmath12 and the on - site interaction between the bosons respectively .",
    "the last term in this model ( [ eq : ham ] ) represents inter - chain hopping with an amplitude @xmath1 between corresponding sites on the two chains .",
    "we set our energy scale by taking @xmath13 .",
    "this model has been studied using the bosonization technique  @xcite at or close to commensurate filling of one boson per site .",
    "this study predicts a transition from a mott insulator to a superfluid phase when the inter - chain hopping is increased and it is in the beresenskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) universality class at commensurate filling . in the present work we verify these predictions and thus complement the earlier analytical results . for this purpose , we study the variation of critical on - site interaction @xmath0 for the superfluid phase to the mott insulator phase transition with the change in the inter - chain hopping amplitude @xmath1 using the finite size density matrix renormalization group method ( fsdmrg )",
    "@xciteand obtain the phase diagram in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the present work is the first application of fsdmrg method to bosonic ladders .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized in the following manner.the fsdmrg method in the context of bosonic ladders is briefly described in section [ sec : fsdmrg ] .",
    "our results are described and discussed in section [ sec : results ] and our conclusions are stated in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we use the fsdmrg technique to obtain the energies and the correlation functions of the ground state .",
    "this method is very efficient and has proven to give accurate results for 1d quantum lattice systems and has been applied to low - dimensional strongly correlated fermionic and bosonic systems  @xcite .",
    "we give below some pertinent details of this method adapted to the system of two coupled chains that we have considered .",
    "we begin with a super - block configuration @xmath15 of @xmath16 rungs as shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the left @xmath17 and the right block @xmath18 have @xmath19 rungs each and the @xmath20 represents one rung of two sites , one from each chain .",
    "thus in every iteration , the new left and right blocks are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we increase the size of the system in every iteration by adding two rungs which increases the number of lattice sites by @xmath23 . to keep the density @xmath24 fixed",
    ", we also increase the number of bosons in the system by @xmath23 .",
    "the truncation of states of left ( right ) block in each iterations corresponds to choosing @xmath25 highest weighted states out of @xmath26 of the left ( right ) density matrix . here",
    "@xmath27 is the number of states kept at each site , which is in general infinity , but we truncate it for a feasible numerical calculation .",
    "we keep @xmath28 in this calculation which is found to be sufficient for the values of @xmath11 considered here  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is chosen such that the truncation error in our calculation is always less than @xmath29 .",
    "the mott insulator phase has a finite gap in its energy spectrum .",
    "the single particle gap is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ground - state energy of two leg bosonic ladder with length @xmath16 having @xmath32 bosons .",
    "the mi phase is signaled by the opening up of the gap @xmath33 .",
    "however , @xmath34 is finite for finite systems and we must extrapolate to the @xmath35 limit , which is best done by using finite - size scaling  @xcite . in the critical region ,",
    "i.e. , sf region , the gap @xmath36 where the scaling function @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the correlation length .",
    "@xmath39 in the sf region .",
    "thus plots of @xmath40 versus @xmath11 , for different system sizes @xmath16 , consist of curves that intersect at the critical point at which the correlation length for @xmath41 diverges and gap @xmath42 vanishes . the phase diagram , as discussed below , is obtained from such plots .",
    "it is now well known that the single chain bose - hubbard model with density @xmath24 shows a sf - mi transition with the critical on - site interaction @xmath43@xcite . in order to understand the effect of the inter - chain hopping on this transition , we varied @xmath1 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and obtained the corresponding critical on - site interaction @xmath46 for the sf - mi transition .",
    "we found that @xmath0 increases with @xmath1 and saturates in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "these results are highlighted by the plots of scaling of gap @xmath40 versus @xmath11 for different values of @xmath1 and lengths @xmath16 .",
    "for example , in the fig.[fig : fig3 ] we plot @xmath40 versus @xmath11 for @xmath48 .",
    "the coalescence of @xmath40 curves for different values of @xmath16 below @xmath49 demonstrates the sf - mi transition with @xmath50 which is much larger than the corresponding value for the single chain @xmath51 .",
    "fig.[fig : fig4 ] represents similar plots for @xmath52 . for this case",
    "the critical on - site interaction increases further to @xmath53 .    from similar plots of @xmath40 versus @xmath11",
    ", we obtain the phase diagram for model ( [ eq : ham ] ) in the @xmath54 plane and it can be seen in fig.[fig : fig5 ] .",
    "@xmath0 for the sf - mi transition initially increases sharply as the inter - chain hopping @xmath1 increases .",
    "this phase diagram verifies the prediction of mi - sf transition with respect to increase in the inter - chain hopping @xmath1@xcite . for higher values of @xmath1",
    ", @xmath0 tends to saturate . for @xmath55 ,",
    "each rung has two one particle states : corresponding to bonding or anti - bonding .",
    "as predicted in the bosonization  @xcite study , this problem then maps onto a single chain bose hubbard model with commensurate density @xmath56 and on - site interaction @xmath57 . to confirm this prediction we plot the variation of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 in fig.[fig : fig6 ] .",
    "critical on - site interaction @xmath0 for large @xmath1 converges to a value equal to @xmath58 .",
    "plotting @xmath40 versus @xmath11 for single chain bose - hubbard model for @xmath56 in fig.[fig : fig7 ] we find that @xmath59 , which is one half the converged value of @xmath60 for the bosonic ladder confirming the prediction made in bosonization study@xcite .",
    "the mott insulator to superfluid transition is found to be beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) universality class at commensurate filling@xcite .",
    "the correlation function that characterizes the superfluid phase is given by @xmath61 which decays as a power law in the limit @xmath62 . here the expectation value is taken with respect to the ground state .",
    "however , in the mott insulator phase it has an exponential decay due to the finite gap in the energy spectrum . the power law decay of this correlation function has been obtained using the bosonization method  @xcite and it is predicted to go as @xmath63 with the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath64 stated to be @xmath65 at the superfluid to mott insulator transition point .    in order to obtain the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath64 we fix @xmath66 and vary the inter - chain hopping @xmath1 and obtain the mott insulator to superfluid transition .",
    "the scaling of gap @xmath40 as a function of @xmath1 is given in fig.[fig : fig8 ] .",
    "the critical inter - chain hopping @xmath67 for the mi to sf transition .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath68 for @xmath66 different values of @xmath1 are given in fig.[fig : fig9 ] .",
    "the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath64 which is obtained by fitting @xmath68 with the expression given in eq.[eq : corr ] is plotted as a function of @xmath69 in fig.[fig : fig10 ] . from these values",
    "the critical @xmath70 for which @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 which is consistent with values obtained from the scaling of the gap .",
    "the results we have obtained could have experimental implications .",
    "it is now possible to prepare bosonic ladders by growing optical superlattices in the form of double well potential along one direction@xcite .",
    "the tunneling between the double well potential will control the inter - chain hopping . by changing dynamically the optical lattice parameters",
    "one can control all the interaction and hopping parameters of the model ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "we have studied the ground state properties of a two chain bosonic ladder with commensurate filling of one boson per site using the finite size density matrix renormalization group method .",
    "the critical on - site interaction for sf - mi phase transition increases sharply for small values of inter - chain hoping amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "however , it saturates in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "thus in the presence of large inter - chain hopping , the system continues to be in the superfluid state even though the single chain is a mott insulator .",
    "thus we confirm the prediction of mott insulator to superfluid transition as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we have obtained the luttinger liquid parameter and compared it with the analytical results .",
    "in addition to verifying and complementing the predictions made by the bosonization technique , we have pointed out the possible experimental verification of our results . we hope that our analysis of the sf - mi transition in bosonic ladders will stimulate experimental studies in this direction .",
