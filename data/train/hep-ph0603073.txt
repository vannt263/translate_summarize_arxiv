    "the derivation of the bfkl equation for qcd scattering amplitudes in the regge regime of high energies @xmath1 and fixed momentum transfers @xmath2 @xcite is based on the fact that gluon is reggeized in perturbation theory . in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) the pomeron singularity in the @xmath3-plane of the @xmath4-channel partial waves appears as a composite state of two reggeized gluons .",
    "the gluon regge trajectory is known in two first orders of perturbation theory and the integral kernel for the bfkl equation is calculated in the next - to - leading approximation @xcite , which is important for the phenomenological applications @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to believe , that the gluon reggeization has a physical meaning even beyond the qcd perturbation theory , although up to now its regge trajectory is calculated only at sufficiently large momentum transfers @xmath5 where the effective coupling constant is small . for low momentum transfers we should use non - perturbative methods . for example",
    ", one can assume that the gluon trajectory in this region is approximately linear , as it takes place for the hadron trajectories .",
    "the linearity of the regge trajectories was an important property in constructing the dual model by g. veneziano @xcite .",
    "later a string interpretation of the dual amplitudes was developed @xcite . in the born approximation",
    "the dual hadron models include only particles lying on the secondary regge trajectories .",
    "the pomeron - like singularity appearing in the open string scattering amplitudes in one loop approximation was identified with a leading regge trajectory for the closed sector .",
    "later it was found that four dimensional string theories meet with difficulties , which were avoided in their superstring generalizations to space - time dimensions @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "now these superstring models are considered as candidates for an unified theory of all elementary particle interactions including the gravity .",
    "moreover , all of them are supposed to be various realizations of the same @xmath7-theory .    in the modern interpretation",
    "the closed string sector is associated with the graviton regge family rather than with the pomeron singularity , and so the pomeron does not directly present in the string theory . in a line with the maldacena proposal @xcite for the @xmath8 super - yang - mills model one might expect an appearance of a colorless composite state becoming a graviton in the thooft limit @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a coupling constant and @xmath11 is the number of colors .",
    "the pomeron singularity seems to be a candidate for such graviton state @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we treat the pomeron similar to the case of perturbative qcd where it is a composite state of two reggeized gluons .",
    "namely , this singularity should appear in the diagrams where two open strings are exchanged in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "such feynman graphs lead to the mandelstam cut in the @xmath3-plane of the @xmath4-channel partial wave @xmath12 .",
    "the sum of contributions from the ladder - type diagrams in the string theory corresponds to the bfkl - like equation .",
    "we hope that its string modification is a reasonable model for non - perturbative effects in the region of small momentum transfers .",
    "indeed , the string models in extra dimensions can lead to a dual description of gauge theories including qcd @xcite .",
    "note , that in the critical dimensions @xmath6 the multi - regge kinematics for intermediate particles in the @xmath13-channel is not unique even for small coupling constants .",
    "namely , one should take into account also the production of resonances having large masses at high energies , which leads in particular to the graviton contribution appearing in one loop . in the last case the imaginary part of the corresponding non - planar diagram with the graviton regge pole in the @xmath4-channel appears from the production of two resonances with masses @xmath14 .",
    "below we does not discuss this problem in details and consider mainly the @xmath0 case .",
    "we use the superstring 4d model in the ramond - neveu - schwarz version @xcite , but the supersymmetry is involved only to remove the tachion from the spectrum .",
    "it is known , that non - critical string models have difficulties related to the absence of the @xmath15-matrix unitarity in higher loops .",
    "in particular , to restore the unitarity in one loop approximation it is needed to introduce an additional @xmath16 gravity field @xcite .",
    "this field provides the conformal symmetry on the tree and one - loop levels , and restores the modular invariance of the one - loop closed string amplitudes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the modular invariance of higher loop closed string amplitudes remains to be broken @xcite .",
    "thus , the higher loop amplitudes for non - critical string models can not be constructed in a self - consistent way .",
    "the difficulties of non - critical string models are related mainly to the closed string sector . in the perturbation theory with respect to the closed string coupling constant @xmath17 the contributions from this sector",
    "grow with energy very rapidly @xmath18 .",
    "such behavior in the case of hadron - hadron interactions is not compatible with the @xmath13 -channel unitarity .",
    "so one expects that once a relevant summation over @xmath19 being performed , the high asymptotics of the amplitude is reduced to @xmath20 .",
    "it is reasonable to omit initially the closed string sector taking into account also , that @xmath17 is quadratic in the yang - mills coupling constant @xmath10 and for @xmath21 the open string terms in the amplitude are enhanced comparing to closed string ones .",
    "thus , we consider here the contributions to the production amplitude only from the open string states in crossing channels leading to the mandelstam cuts for the elastic @xmath22 -channel partial wave @xmath23 in the angular momentum plane @xmath24 .    in the discussed model",
    "the gluon trajectory @xmath25 is given by the perturbative expansion @xmath26 where @xmath27 are radiative corrections , and the regge slope @xmath28 is a reversed square of an characteristic mass scale . below the correction @xmath29 to the trajectory",
    "is also taken into account .",
    "this correction is calculated from one - loop diagrams for the scattering amplitude .",
    "one - loop non - planar diagrams contain also a contribution destroying the unitarity , but the correction to the regge trajectory appears only from the planar graphs , where the problem with the closed string sector does not exist . providing that @xmath30 ,",
    "the loop correction in the @xmath0 case has the infrared divergency @xmath31 which is cancelled with the contribution from the massless particle production . for @xmath32 the radiative correction to the regge trajectory",
    "has a complicated form .",
    "an important difference between qcd and the string model is related to the role of intermediate states with relatively large masses : @xmath33 for produced resonances .",
    "these states are absent in qcd . in the string theory",
    "the large mass states are responsible for the appearance of the graviton contribution to the elastic scattering amplitude in the one - loop approximation .",
    "further , the impact factors for the reggeon - particle scattering vanish for planar diagrams as a result of integration over large masses . in particular",
    ", it leads to the absence of the mandelstam cuts in the color octet channel .",
    "in qcd the cancellation of these cuts for the @xmath4-channel with gluon quantum numbers is provided by another mechanism related to the so - called bootstrap relations for scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the large mass kinematics is responsible also for the additional term in the kernel of the bfkl equation corresponding to the soft pomeron contribution .",
    "it is important , that in the considered string model even in the tree approximation there is a colorless state in the @xmath4-channel with vacuum quantum numbers and a positive signature . in upper orders of the perturbation theory",
    "its regge trajectory is renormalized . at small @xmath4",
    "this state mixes with the mandelstam cut constructed from two reggeized gluons .",
    "the radiative corrections to its trajectory are calculated from ladder diagrams in the @xmath4-channel .",
    "the @xmath13-channel imaginary part of scattering amplitudes appears from the intermediate states in the above considered kinematics with relatively large masses : @xmath34 for produced resonances .",
    "physically the @xmath3-plane singularity with the vacuum quantum numbers in the tree approximation corresponds to the soft pomeron which can exist together with the hard bfkl pomeron .",
    "similar to the perturbative qcd , we restrict ourselves to the region @xmath35 .",
    "however , in the string case , the region @xmath36 is possible also because the regge slope @xmath37 has no @xmath38 smallness . some important properties of the bfkl equation are related to this fact . in particular , we obtain that for @xmath39 its solution is concentrated near the saddle point @xmath40 for the reggeon transverse momenta @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "the fluctuations of this momentum are small @xmath43 and therefore the transverse momenta of the emitted gluons are also small @xmath44 .",
    "in the same time there are no similar restrictions on transverse momenta of the virtual gluons entering in the loop corrections to the gluon regge trajectories .",
    "it means , that the contribution from the multiple saddle points @xmath45 is suppressed by the reggeization effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the bfkl approach to the perturbative qcd is briefly reviewed . in sec .",
    "3 the superstring model which will be used later is introduced . in sec .",
    "4 the calculation of the multi - regge asymptotics of production amplitudes is presented . in sec .",
    "5 the bfkl - like equation for the superstring model is derived .",
    "also the vanishing of the impact factors for planar diagrams is demonstrated . in more details",
    "this problem is considered in appendix d. in sec .",
    "6 the calculation of the bfkl kernel is performed . in sec .",
    "7 the equation for the case @xmath0 is discussed . among other things ,",
    "it is explained why in the space - time @xmath6 the non - regge kinematics contributes to the regge asymptotics of amplitudes . in sec .",
    "8 the solution of the bfkl equation at small values of @xmath46 is constructed . in sec .",
    "9 an algebraic approach to this problem is developed and integrability properties of similar equations for composite states of several open strings in the multi - colour limit including a relation with the heisenberg spin model are discussed .",
    "appendices a , b and c contain some details of calculations .",
    "as it was mentioned already , in the perturbative qcd the bfkl pomeron appears as a composite state of two reggeized gluons @xcite .",
    "the gluon is reggeized as a result of summing radiative corrections to the born amplitude @xmath47 for the colored particle scattering @xmath48 in the regge kinematics of large energies @xmath49 and fixed momentum transfers @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath47 is given below @xmath52=i\\,f_{cc^{\\prime } d}\\,t^{d }   \\label{born}\\ ] ] and @xmath53 is the gluon regge trajectory known in two first orders of the perturbation theory @xmath54    the trajectory contains logarithmic divergencies cancelled in the total cross sections with the contributions from the production of soft gluons .",
    "for example , in one loop approximation we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a gluon mass introduced for the regularization of the infraredly divergent integral . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude for the production of @xmath19 gluons with momenta @xmath57 in the multi - regge kinematics @xmath58 has the factorized form @xmath59 where the effective vertex @xmath60 for an emission of the gluon with a definite helicity is @xmath61    here we introduced the complex coordinates @xmath62 for transverse components @xmath63 of gluon momenta . the contribution to the elastic scattering amplitude from the intermediate state having a gluon with the momentum @xmath64 is proportional to the expression @xmath65 and contains the pole @xmath66 . the integration over @xmath67 cancels the infrared divergency in the gluon regge trajectory appearing in the virtual corrections to the production amplitudes .",
    "it is convenient to present the elastic amplitude for the colorless particle scattering in the form of the mellin representation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath4-channel partial wave analytically continued to the complex values @xmath70 of the angular momentum .",
    "the amplitude @xmath71 contains only the contribution from the @xmath4-channel state with vacuum quantum numbers and the positive signature , corresponding to the bfkl pomeron . a positive value of the parameter @xmath72 in the above representation is chosen from the condition , that all singularities of @xmath69 are situated to the left from the integration contour .",
    "the @xmath4-channel partial wave @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of the gluon - gluon scattering amplitude @xmath73 integrated with the impact - factors @xmath74 @xmath75 the impact - factors of colorless particles vanish at small gluon momenta    @xmath76    which leads to an infrared  stability of @xmath77 .",
    "the partial wave @xmath73 satisfies the bfkl equation @xcite @xmath78 here @xmath79 is a non - homogeneous term corresponding to the impact factor .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath80 is an integral operator , which can be defined by its action on the pomeron wave function @xmath81 in the coordinate representation @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 and we introduced the complex coordinates and momenta @xmath84    the hamiltonian has the property of the mbius invariance , which allows us to find its eigenfunctions @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 are conformal weights .",
    "the high energy asymptotics of the total cross - section is parametrized by the pomeron intercept @xmath87 @xmath88 in the leading logarithmic approximation we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the ground state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the cross - section @xmath91 violates the froissart theorem @xmath92 . in the next - to - leading approximation",
    "the cross - section grows also , but not so rapidly ( see @xcite ) .    to verify the gluon reggeization",
    "one can use the @xmath13 and @xmath93-channel unitarity constraints and dispersion relations to calculate by iterations the scattering amplitude with the color octet quantum numbers in the @xmath4-channel @xcite . in lla",
    "it is enough to consider only the multi - regge kinematics for intermediate particles in the direct channels . in this kinematics",
    "the production amplitude has the multi - regge form ( [ multreg ] )",
    ". the reggeization hypothesis should be in an agreement with the @xmath13- and @xmath94- channel unitarity .",
    "this requirement leads to the so - called bootstrap relations .",
    "the simplest bootstrap relation corresponds to the statement , that the scattering amplitude , obtained from the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for the wave function of the composite state of two reggeized gluons in the octet channel should coincide with the regge pole anzatz for the amplitude constructed in terms of the reggeized gluon exchange . in the momentum space",
    "the equation for the @xmath4-chanel partial wave @xmath95 with the gluon quantum numbers has the form @xcite @xmath96 @xmath97 where the gluon mass @xmath56 is introduced with the use of the higgs mechanism to regularize the infrared divergencies .",
    "it is obvious , that in an accordance with the bootstrap requirement the solution of the above equation corresponds to the regge pole anzatz @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the gluon regge trajectory .",
    "in the string and superstring models the scattering amplitude in the tree approximation satisfies the duality requirement : namely , the sum over the resonances in the @xmath4-channel related to its regge asymptotics in the @xmath13-channel is equal to the ( analytically continued ) sum of resonances in the @xmath100 and @xmath93-channels : @xmath101 the particles with squared masses equal to @xmath102 and integer spins @xmath103 lie on the linear regge trajectories @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath28 are their intercept and slope , respectively .",
    "the slope @xmath28  is universal for all excitations of the open string . for the closed strings it is equal to @xmath106 . as for intercepts , in the critical dimensions @xmath107 for the bosonic string and @xmath6 for the superstrings ,",
    "they are integer or half - integer numbers . in particular , for the intercepts of the leading bosonic regge trajectories , corresponding to the massless vector ( @xmath108 ) particle -  gluon  and tensor ( @xmath109 ) particle -  graviton  we have respectively @xmath110 we put @xmath111 also for the @xmath0 model to leave the gluon on the trajectory .",
    "the  graviton  is absent in this case , instead one has a non - physical cut in the @xmath3 -plane .",
    "the regge asymptotics of @xmath71 in the dual models appears as a result of summing over the poles in the @xmath13-channel . really at large @xmath13",
    "the contributions @xmath112 with integer values of @xmath113 are cancelled and we can substitute approximately the sum over @xmath114 by the dispersion integral @xmath115 it agrees with the regge asymptotics @xmath116 providing that @xmath117 .    in the born approximation",
    "there are only stable particles in the intermediate state , but with taking into account loop corrections these particles acquire the widths due to their decay into lower mass states . as a result , @xmath118 has the @xmath119-like singularities only for a finite number of stable states and the amplitude is a smooth function for large values of @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath120 can be expanded in the series over the parameter @xmath121 and one can interpret the corresponding term of the expansion @xmath122 as a contribution from the production of @xmath19 particles in a multi - regge kinematics .",
    "in qcd such a non - perturbative contribution @xmath123 to the regge trajectory could appear from the integration region @xmath124 in the loop corrections of the type of ( [ traj ] ) . in this case",
    "the common factor @xmath4 would lead to the linearity of the trajectory at small @xmath4 .    to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the born amplitude for the tachyon - tachyon scattering amplitude in the bosonic string theory @xmath125 where for simplicity we omitted the chan - paton factors .",
    "asymptotically one obtains @xmath126    this result corresponds to the regge asymptotics described by the reggeized gluon exchange in the @xmath4-channel . for other colliding particles",
    "there are additional factors depending on their spins .",
    "they are related to different residues for the corresponding regge pole .",
    "note , that the effective vertices for reggeized gluon interactions in qcd were obtained also from the string amplitudes in the limit @xmath127 @xcite .    for the superstring models the multiplier @xmath128 in ( [ tach ] ) is replaced by @xmath129 , which leads to the absence of the tachyon pole at @xmath130 . at small momentum transfers",
    "both models give the same amplitude for the massless vector boson scattering .",
    "taking , however , into account that one should sum over other intermediate @xmath4-channel states for the scattering amplitude with arbitrary momentum transfers , it is natural to consider only the superstring model where the tachyon disappears from the spectrum .",
    "the regge limit of the superstring scattering amplitude is given in the end of this section ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as it was said in introduction , we use the ramond - neveu - schwarz version of the open superstring model . in this model",
    "the interaction vertices are calculated in terms of the scalar superfield @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a world - sheet coordinate and @xmath133 is its superpartner . here",
    "@xmath7 labels the space - time coordinates , @xmath134 .",
    "the vertex @xmath135 for the emission of a massless vector boson with its momentum @xmath136 and polarization vector @xmath137 is given below @xcite @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are scalar products of the corresponding @xmath141-dimensional vectors .",
    "as usually , the relation @xmath142 is valid for polarizations of external vector bosons . in the contrast to the string tradition , in this paper we use the  mostly minus metrics  @xmath143 .",

    "derivative in @xmath133 .",
    "note , that the gauge invariance @xmath147 of the amplitudes is valid due to the relation @xmath148    the superfield vacuum correlator @xmath149 in super - coordinates for @xmath150 equals @xmath151\\ , ,   \\label{scorr}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 is the space - time metrics .",
    "the massless boson tree amplitude is obtained by integrating the vacuum expectation of the product of the vertices @xmath153 ( [ vert ] ) over @xmath154 .",
    "the variables @xmath154 are assigned to the vertex for an emission of the boson carrying the momentum @xmath155 and polarization @xmath156 . in the amplitude",
    "we do not integrate over three of coordinates @xmath157 using the integrand invariance under @xmath158-transformation . to conserve this symmetry after fixing the variables @xmath159 one should include in the final expression the additional multiplier @xmath160 leading to an independence of the born amplitude from the choice of these variables .",
    "thus , the open string amplitude @xmath161 for the interaction of @xmath19 massless bosons in a tree approximation is given by @xmath162 where each a term corresponds to an ordering of the parameters @xmath157 : @xmath163 and the sum is taken over the configurations , which are non - equivalent under the cyclic transmutations of indices @xmath164 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath165 is the chan - paton factor @xcite for the given color group .",
    "further , the expression @xmath166 is the integral over @xmath154 from the vacuum expectation of the product of interaction vertices multiplied by the factor @xmath167 : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the step function : @xmath170 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "since the correlator ( [ scorr ] ) is singular at @xmath174 , the integral ( [ opsamt ] ) is convergent only in a certain region of invariants constructed from external particle momenta .",
    "each of the terms @xmath175 in ( [ opsam ] ) is calculated for such signs of the invariants where it is convergent , and the result is analytically continued to their physical values for the production kinematics .",
    "the integrand in ( [ opsamt ] ) contains some contributions which do not contribute to the final result because they are total derivatives in integration variables .",
    "one can make their cancelation explicit using the fact , that the integrand in the superstring case is invariant under the @xmath158-susy transformation @xcite : @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are given below @xmath179 here @xmath72 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 are bosonic parameters and @xmath183 , @xmath119 are their grassmann partners .",

    "this symmetry is non - splitted because it mixes the grassmann variables to bosonic ones .",
    "note , that the step function factors in ( [ opsamt ] ) lead after the symmetry transformation to the @xmath119 -function type terms which are multiplied by expressions vanishing in the kinematical region where the integral is convergent . to avoid the consideration of such terms",

    "<S> we consider scattering amplitudes in string models in the regge limit of high energies and fixed momentum transfers with the use of the unitarity in direct channels . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate states are taken in the multi - regge kinematics corresponding to the production of resonances with fixed invariant masses and large relative rapidities . in qcd </S>",
    "<S> such kinematics leads to the bfkl equation for the pomeron wave function in the leading logarithmic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a similar equation in the string theory and discuss its properties . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this investigation is to find a generalization of the bfkl approach to the region of small momentum transfers where non - perturbative corrections to the gluon regge trajectory and reggeon couplings are essential . </S>",
    "<S> the bfkl equation in the string theory contains additional contributions coming from a linear part of the regge trajectory and from the soft pomeron singularity appearing already in the tree approximation . in higher dimensions in addition , a non - multi - regge kinematics corresponding to production of particles with large masses </S>",
    "<S> is important . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the equation for the pomeron wave function in the string theory for @xmath0 and discuss integrability properties of analogous equations for composite states of several reggeised gluons in the multi - colour limit . </S>"
