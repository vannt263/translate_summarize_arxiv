    "we can conclude that these brightest members of the young open cluster vdb  130 associated with the cyg  ob1 give an idea on the apparent cluster motion on the sky . to draw more definite conclusions on the reality of the gravitationally bound young stellar group additional precise proper motions measurements and spectroscopic observations",
    "are needed that would allow refining the spectral classification and provide accurate radial velocity measurements .",

    "@xmath91 is the fuv radiation field in units of the draine field @xcite , and @xmath92 is the gas density .",
    "our estimate for the electron density of the order of 100 @xmath68 implies @xmath93 .",
    "note that in our picture all these regions are related to the boundary of the hii  region around vdb  130 .",
    "the second group consists of blob  e and the _ w3 _ , _",
    "w4 _ , and _",
    "w6 _ regions , that belong to blob  w. their colours do not fall into the domain considered in the work of @xcite , with the [ 3.6][4.5 ] colour being positive and the [ 4.5][5.8 ] colour being slightly below 3 . extrapolating results of @xcite , we may assume that absorption in these directions is higher than @xmath94 and @xmath90 is lower than 2 .",
    "we can not expect that @xmath91 is low in the region of bright near - ir emission , so lower @xmath90 is probably caused by higher density ( consistent with higher absorption ) .",
    "note that extinction values inferred from @xcite diagram agree with our estimates .",
    "finally , the third group in our sample includes the _",
    "w5 _ region and the nebulosity around the star 4r .",
    "location of the _",
    "w5 _ region nearly coincides with the location of the star 1r . according to @xcite ,",
    "their colours ( [ 3.6][4.5 ] @xmath95 and [ 4.5][5.8 ] @xmath96 ) can be explained by the emission of the low - temperature shocked h@xmath97 gas .",
    "thus , we may tentatively conclude that h@xmath1 blob , blob  w , and blob  e and may be other regions with suppressed 8@xmath79 m emission , also seen in fig .",
    "[ ir]d ( like a region around the star 4r ) , are actually hii  regions surrounding young massive stars",
    ". in particular , the infrared emission properties of h@xmath1 blob are entirely consistent with our conclusion on the hii  region that surrounds the cluster vdb  130 , based on the optical spectra .",
    "blob  w and blob  e can be excited by the stars 1r ( b1v ) and 5r ( b1v-2v ) , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vdb130 ] ) , while h@xmath1 blob can be excited , among others , by stars 11r ( b1v ) and 12r , which are members of the cluster vdb  130 .",
    "being more extended and fainter in all infrared bands up to 160@xmath79 m , h@xmath1 blob is probably older than the other hii  regions in this area .",
    "we note that big filament which borders h@xmath1 blob from the west , partially encircles a ring - like feature , seen on the map of the [ sii]/h@xmath1 ratio ( fig .  [ fig : siitoha]b ) , which is also visible as an absorption feature on the dss image .",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath1 ratio is somewhat enhanced along this ring - like feature relative to its interior , indicative of a shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : siitoha]c ) . as we mentioned in the previous subsection , in the eastern part of the region we observe a clear signature of a shock .",
    "the sickle - like feature bordering blob  w from the west may have been formed by h@xmath1 blob expansion , when the ionization front has started to engulf a parent clump for blob  w.    the presence of hii  regions in the vicinity of vdb  130 stresses the problem of its age overestimation .",
    "if h@xmath1 blob is indeed excited by the cluster star(s ) , their interaction should have started quite recently , after the cluster itself had formed .",
    "it must be noted that the stars 1r and 5r , which we propose as exciting stars for blob  w and blob  e ( as there are no other b stars in the blobs vicinity ) , may not be cluster members ( see above ) .",
    "it is interesting that the three blobs are located at the tip of a long chain of millimetre sources that extends to the west far beyond big filament @xcite .",
    "this also hints that the co cloud , also visible in the dust continuum , may be a remain of a bigger structure that has been destroyed by the expanding supershell .",
    "it is also possible that the interaction between the pre - existing cloud and the expanding supershell has moved some molecular material in the vicinity of the cluster b - stars , initiating the formation of h@xmath1 blob .",
    "we may ask then whether blob  w and blob  e formation has been triggered by an expansion of h@xmath1 blob .",
    "their location hints at some causal link with the shell , but the available information is definitely not sufficient for any firm conclusion .",
    "detailed analysis of stellar populations and the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the cluster vdb  130 was performed , using optical observations taken with the 6-m telescope of sao ras and the 125-cm telescope of the crimean laboratory of sai msu as well as archival data from _",

    "the following results are obtained .",
    "1 .   new revision of the stellar population of vdb  130 revealed 36 stars with proper motions differing by less than @xmath14 from the centroid determined by @xcite ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the sample shows large scatter of colours ( 0.6 mag for faint stars ) that can be considered as an evidence for substantial differential reddening across the cluster . the minimum colour excess @xmath99  mag , and the apparent distance module @xmath100  mag , whereas in nir @xmath101  mag and @xmath102  mag .",
    "since nir data are corrupted by large and inhomogeneous extinction in much lesser extent then in optics , we consider cluster parameters obtained from 2mass photometric data as more reliable .",
    "photometric data are consistent with young cluster age ranging from 5 to 10 myrs and distance of about @xmath38  kpc .",
    "the physical relation between vdb  130 , which is located near the outer boundary of a supershell surrounding the cyg  ob1 association , and the cometary molecular cloud with the size of @xmath61 @xcite is corroborated by ( 1 ) similar distances to the cluster and the association ( 1.5  1.8  kpc ) , which agree within the errors , and ( 2 ) the agreement of line - of - sight velocities of the cloud ( @xmath53 ) , cyg ob1 stars , and hydrogen ionized by these stars ( @xmath103 ) . the molecular cloud is located in the region influenced by the stellar wind and radiation of cyg  ob1 and vdb  130 stars .",

    "the inner part of the shell is partially filled with diffuse emission at 8 and 24@xmath79 m , with 24@xmath79 m emission being brighter than 8@xmath79 m emission .",
    "such a relation between 8@xmath79 m and 24@xmath79 m is typical for galactic hii  regions , so we suggest that this shell marks the location of an ionization front in an hii  region , h@xmath1 blob , which is also visible on our h@xmath1 and [ sii ]  maps and is probably produced by the hottest stars of vdb  130 . at the eastern border of the hii  region encircled by the ir filament signatures of a weak shock are identified .",
