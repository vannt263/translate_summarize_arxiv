    "there are many systems in nature whose dynamics become slow in some part of their phase diagram , because they undergo a transition from a fluid to a disordered solid phase  like in a sol - gel transition , a glass transition , or a jamming transition .",
    "these systems are generically called `` glassy materials '' , examples of which are simple or polymeric liquids , colloidal particles with soft - core or hard - core interactions , grains , etc . as physicists",
    ", we would like to have a microscopic understanding of the slow dynamics of these materials and would like to answer , in particular , an apparently very simple question : how do particles move in a glassy material close to the fluid - solid transition ? to answer this question directly , one needs to resolve the dynamics of individual particles . in experiments , this is a particularly hard task for molecular liquids , although some techniques are now available  @xcite but becomes much easier in the colloidal and granular worlds , where direct visualization is possible  @xcite .",
    "of course , resolving single particle dynamics is trivial in computer simulations where , for each particle in the system , the equations of motion are directly integrated .    hence , single particle dynamics have now been well documented , both numerically and experimentally , in a wide variety of materials . a most striking feature emerging from these studies",
    "is the existence of dynamic heterogeneity  @xcite . in terms of single particle trajectories ,",
    "dynamic heterogeneity implies the existence of relatively broad distributions of mobilities inside the system .",
    "it is therefore an important task to suggest a framework to describe and interpret those data , and hopefully understand the physical content carried by single particle displacements .    in this work",
    ", we study an assembly of moderately attractive colloidal particles ( attraction depth @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the thermal energy ) that undergo dynamic arrest at an `` intermediate '' volume fraction , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the system is in fact intermediate between fractal gels made of very strongly attractive particles ( @xmath3 ) at very low volume fraction , and hard sphere glasses obtained with no attraction ( @xmath4 ) at a much higher volume fraction , @xmath5 .",
    "although experiments clearly detect the presence of an amorphous phase with arrested dynamics , the nature of the transition towards this `` dense gel '' ( or low density glass ! ) remains unclear  @xcite .",
    "the transition seems too far from the so - called `` attractive glass '' obtained at higher volume fraction in colloids with very short - range attraction ( sticky particles ) , so that other phenomena are usually invoked .",
    "a popular hypothesis is that gelation is in fact a non - equilibrium phenomenon due to a kinetically arrested phase separation  @xcite .",
    "dynamic heterogeneity in such systems has been analyzed before in just a few systems , both experimentally  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze single particle dynamics on the approach to the glassy phase and show that the self - part of the van hove distribution function is not the gaussian expected for a fickian process , but that it reflects instead the existence , at any given time , of colloids with widely different mobilities : our system is dynamically heterogeneous .",
    "we then show that the simple analytical model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe data in a variety of systems close to glass and jamming transitions also describes our experimental data in a satisfactory manner .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ exp ] we describe the system , experimental techniques , and the results obtained for the van hove function . in sec .",
    "[ modelsec ] we describe the model used to fit the experimental data and discuss the results .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the experimental system under study is a suspension of colloidal particles interacting through a hard - core repulsion and a softer attractive interaction , induced by depletion by adding polymers .",
    "details of the system have been presented in ref .",
    "the dynamics of this system is observed using confocal fluorescence microscopy .",
    "the strength of the inter - particle attractive interaction , @xmath6 , is determined by the concentration of polymers in the suspension .",
    "we present data for a sample at a moderate interaction strength of @xmath7 .",
    "we work at constant temperature @xmath8 , so that our control parameter is the volume fraction of the particles , @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the system becomes a gel when @xmath9 is increased , with a transition close to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "measurement of different relevant statistical quantities are carried out at different @xmath11 .",
    "our procedure to vary slowly the volume fraction uses particle sedimentation .",
    "the relative buoyancy of the colloids is @xmath12  g/@xmath13 , corresponding to a gravitational height of @xmath14 particle radii @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "therefore , the gravitational field is small enough that it induces a very slow densification of the system .",
    "the densification is slow enough that microscopic dynamics of the colloids remains controlled by the interplay between attraction and steric hindrance , rather than by sedimentation itself .",
    "moreover , the large asymmetry between polymer coil diffusion time , @xmath17  s , and particle sedimentation time over one particle , @xmath18  s , ensures that polymers are uniformly distributed , maintaining the interaction strength @xmath6 constant in the course of the experiment .",
    "the colloidal particles are polymethyl - methacrylate ( pmma ) spheres of diameter @xmath19 m , sterically stabilized by chemically grafted poly-12-hydroxystearic acid , dyed with the electrically neutral fluorophore 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2 oxa-1,3-diazole ( nbd ) , and suspended in a solvent mixture of decahydronaphthalene ( decalin ) , tetrahydronaphthalene ( tetralin ) , and cyclohexyl bromide ( cxb ) that allows for independent control of the refractive index and buoyancy matching with the particles .",
    "polystyrene polymers ( molecular weight @xmath20  g / mol ) are added at @xmath21 mg / ml to induce a depletion attraction at a range estimated by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the polymer radius of gyration .",
    "using confocal microscopy , we collect stacks of images at fixed time intervals ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25  s at different @xmath9 to access short and long time dynamics during the approach to gelation . from the stacks of images we extract the particle positions of @xmath26 particles in three dimensions and track their positions at better than 10  nm resolution over time .",
    "a three - dimensional rendering of a typical particle configuration from a stack of images at @xmath27 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ snap429 ] .      in an earlier work  @xcite , we analyzed some structural and dynamical properties of the system for different volume fractions .",
    "in particular , we analyzed in some detail the distinct part of the van hove function , finding dynamic signatures typical of gel systems .",
    "we only presented briefly some preliminary results concerning the self - part of the van hove function .",
    "it is the latter that we investigate in more detail here .",
    "it is defined by @xmath28 ) , \\label{gsdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the position of particle @xmath30 at time @xmath31 along one of the horizontal directions .",
    "the function @xmath32 measures the probability that a given particle has undergone a displacement @xmath33 in a time interval of duration @xmath31 .",
    "once the distribution ( [ gsdef ] ) is known , several quantities can be determined .",
    "perhaps the simplest one is the mean squared displacement , @xmath34 , where the average is taken over the distribution @xmath32 , which contains quantitative information about the average mobility of the colloidal particles . in particular , its long - time limit yields values for the self - diffusion constant @xmath35 of the particles through @xmath36 for large @xmath31 .",
    "such a measurement , however , tells nothing about the possible presence of dynamic heterogeneity in the system .",
    "in our earlier study  @xcite , we had measured @xmath34 ; although we observed a slowing down of the dynamics , the heterogeneous nature remains hidden and could only be seen by measuring @xmath32 . in fig .",
    "[ fit ] , we have plotted @xmath37 for four different volume fractions ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 corresponds to the time when @xmath41 ( @xmath15 being the particle radius ) - which is a meaningful measure of the timescale for structural relaxation  @xcite .",
    "we can clearly see that @xmath32 , at this timescale , is very non - gaussian and therefore , the particle trajectories do not correspond to fickian dynamics .    it can be easily seen that although , in all four cases , most of the statistical weight of the functions is carried by particles which have barely moved , @xmath42 m , there is a pronounced tail extending to distances that are much larger than what is expected for the gaussian prediction shown as dashed lines @xcite . the small @xmath33 behavior , however , is not far from a gaussian distribution , corresponding to quasi - harmonic vibrations in the cage formed by neighbouring particles , but at large distances the decay is well described by an exponential , rather than a gaussian , decay .",
    "thus , the single particle motion for our experimental system at timescales corresponding to @xmath40 is strongly non - diffusive .",
    "such a non - gaussian behaviour has been observed in other glass - forming systems , both in simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite .",
    "such non - gaussianity is related to the presence of heterogeneity in the dynamics of the particles in the system .",
    "most of the particles simply undergo vibrational motion around their initial position  this corresponds to the central gaussian part in @xmath32 .",
    "additionally , a small fraction of the particles gets the opportunity to explore larger distances during the observational time and contributing to the non - trivial tail of @xmath32  @xcite",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ fit ] shows that , with increasing volume fraction , the width of the central gaussian of @xmath32 at time @xmath40 decreases while the tail gets more pronounced .",
    "this implies that even though the volume available for the quasi - harmonic vibrations decreases with @xmath9 , some particles still find pathways to travel large distances and allow the structural relaxation of the system .",
    "several attempts have been previously made to empirically fit the non - gaussian shape of @xmath32 with known functional forms .",
    "weeks _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have tried to fit their experimentally measured @xmath32 with a stretched exponential function , in order to fit both the broad tails and the narrow center .",
    "attempts have also been made to fit both components of the van hove function as the sum of two different gaussian functions  @xcite .",
    "however , neither attempts seem to give satisfactory results since the shape of the distribution changes with time .",
    "basing their analysis on numerical simulations of a lennard - jones system , stariolo and fabricius  @xcite recognized that the tails are probably better fitted with an exponential function in some time window .",
    "using extensive data , it has recently been shown  @xcite that the @xmath32 , for different glass - formers , colloidal hard spheres and granular materials close to jamming are better represented by a superposition of a central gaussian along with an exponential tail for the large distances , which crosses over , at large times , to a gaussian form .",
    "the model therefore allows one to describe the data at different times without changing the fitting formula in the middle of the game .",
    "as we show below , the exponential tail is interpreted as the direct consequence of the occurrence of rare events of particles undergoing large displacements that are statistically distributed .",
    "there have been several attempts to map the heterogeneous single particle dynamics of gels and glass - formers to some stochastic process . closely related to our approach",
    "are the ones of refs .",
    "odagaki and hiwatari  @xcite have studied the dynamics of atoms near the glass transition of simple classical liquids , on the basis of a mesoscopic stochastic - trapping diffusion model , and calculated various dynamical quantities such as the mean squared displacement , non - gaussian parameter and intermediate scattering functions .",
    "monthus and bouchaud  @xcite have looked at various models of independent particles hopping between energy traps which have relaxation functions similar to glass - formers .",
    "they also show that diffusion in trap models can be described using the formalism of the continuous time random walk ( ctrw )  @xcite , widely used in many different areas of physics .",
    "finally , berthier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also proposed to describe the process of self - diffusion in glass - forming materials in terms of a ctrw picture , and they base their analysis on the study of spin facilitated models . in this context , the ctrw picture directly follows quite generically from the spatially heterogeneous nature of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a convincing empirical rationale for this type of approaches stems from a visual inspection of particle trajectories in materials with slow dynamics , such as the ones shown in both panels of fig .",
    "[ ctrwfig ] , which represent examples of particle displacements for a lennard - jones supercooled liquid  @xcite and for the present colloidal system .",
    "direct visualization reveals that , when observed on a timescale comparable to @xmath40 , most of the particles simply perform a large number of localized vibrations around their initial position , just as in a disordered solid .",
    "however , the particles that contribute to the tail of the van hove function undergo one or several quasi - instantaneous jumps separating long periods of localized vibrations , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ctrwfig ] . for both systems , we observe that these jumps occur randomly in time and also have distributed amplitudes . therefore ,",
    "a continuous time random walk  @xcite should be a good coarse - grained stochastic model for single particle trajectories of these systems as suggested before  @xcite .",
    "the case of very low density gels is peculiar , since in these systems there is a well - defined network of quasi - immobile particles existing along with the free particles .",
    "therefore , the system can truly be decomposed into two dynamically distinct families , whose properties directly follow from the heterogeneous nature of the stucture of these gels .",
    "indeed , a two - family dynamical model has been shown to fit the van hove distribution functions obtained in computer simulations of gel systems for a wide window of parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , for denser systems , we have no structural basis to assume that such a distinction can be made , although this has been done in other studies  @xcite . for supercooled liquids",
    ", it can even be quantitatively established by simulations  @xcite that dynamic heterogeneity at the particle scale has no such structural origin . since the present system lies somewhat in between low density gels and dense glasses , it is not obvious _ a priori _ whether we should adopt a glass ( one family ) or a gel ( two families ) description .",
    "in fact , we will show that the strong hypothesis of a two - family model is not necessary to account for our measurements .",
    "therefore we will model the system as a collection of indistinguishable particles undergoing continuous time random walks and we prove below that such a modeling accounts well for the data presented in fig .",
    "obviously , a two - family model would also fit our data very well since one can always artificially separate one group of particles into two distinct subgroups , ( the reverse is not necessarily true ) .",
    "we now describe the ctrw model , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which will be used to fit the experimental data .",
    "we consider particles undergoing a stationary , three - dimensional , isotropic random walk process , as in the original montroll - weiss ctrw model  @xcite , and add to the process localized vibrations occuring on a fast timescale in between the jumps .",
    "we assume that vibrations are gaussian and distributed according to @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 represents the variance of the size of vibrations .",
    "we also assume that the jump size is distributed according to @xmath45 , introducing @xmath46 , the variance in the size of the jumps .",
    "the last ingredient needed to define the ctrw model is the distribution of times between jumps , called the waiting time distribution  @xcite , which we denote as @xmath47 , for reasons that will become clear in a moment .    with these definitions , one can express the van hove function as  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the probability to make @xmath50 jumps in a time @xmath31 , and @xmath51 is the probability to move a distance @xmath52 in @xmath50 jumps  @xcite .",
    "these probabilities involve convolutions and are more easily expressed in the fourier - laplace domain , ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . the sum in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) is geometric and can be performed easily to yield the well - known result  @xcite : @xmath56 where we defined @xmath57 and the distribution @xmath58 is related to the waiting time distribution @xmath47 through the feller relation  @xcite : @xmath59 physically , @xmath58 represents the distribution of the time , @xmath31 , a walker takes to undergo a jump starting from an arbitrary initial condition at time @xmath60 . note",
    "that @xmath61 becomes equal to @xmath62 when the distribution of waiting time is a simple exponential , while it also follows that the moments of @xmath63 are larger than those of @xmath64 if the distributions are broader than exponential  @xcite . in a measurement of the van hove function , @xmath58 represents the distribution of the time to the first observed jump , as seen in the first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , corresponding to @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath47 quantifies the time between subsequent jumps and contributes to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) which contains the contribution of all the terms with @xmath66 in the sum ( [ sum ] ) .",
    "the importance of the distinction between the first and subsequent jumps in order to derive the correct expression of the van hove function was emphasized long ago by tunaley  @xcite , and is crucial when the distribution of waiting time becomes broad . as noted by monthus and bouchaud  @xcite , and by barkai and coworkers  @xcite ,",
    "this first term is in fact directly responsible of the aging dynamics observed in ctrw characterized by `` fat '' waiting time distributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , barkai _ et al .",
    "_ even provide an example of a system for which the average time to the first jump is infinite , while the average time between jumps is finite : eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) then shows that in that case particles never leave their initial positions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite refer to the two distributions as `` persistence '' and `` exchange '' and relate them to the decoupling phenomena observed in supercooled liquids .    to proceed further and use eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) to fit experimental or numerical data , one needs input about the waiting time distribution .",
    "it has been claimed by odagaki and hiwatari  @xcite that waiting time distributions in a binary mixture of soft spheres becomes fat with power law tails at low temperature , as in the trap models studied of monthus and bouchaud  @xcite .",
    "garrahan and coworkers performed extensive studies of waiting time distributions both in kinetically constrained glass models  @xcite and more recently using molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "their results clearly confirm that waiting time distributions in glass - forming systems are not trivial .",
    "in particular , they report measurements of various moments of the distributions @xmath61 and @xmath62 and confirm that they evolve differently with temperature  @xcite , establishing the complex nature of the waiting time distributions for glass - formers .    using these insights , we have suggested  @xcite the following simplification to make the use of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) much more practical . in the absence of definite information on the detailed shape of @xmath47",
    ", we characterize @xmath58 and and @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) by their respective first moments , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and we generally expect that @xmath69 we assume that the distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are exponential , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and that they are independent from one another . the real link between them in the feller relation ( [ feller ] ) and their complex shapes are now hidden in the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , which corresponds to the particles undergoing localized vibrations modulated by the waiting time distribution for first jumps , controls the shape of the central part of the van hove function @xmath32 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) is responsible for the broad tail in @xmath32 and stems from particles which have performed one or several jumps after a time @xmath31 . using parameters relevant for our colloidal system (",
    "see below for the details of the fitting procedure ) , we present on an extended vertical scale , the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) concerning the shape of the van hove function and its evolution with time in fig .",
    "the van hove functions can clearly be described as the superposition of `` mobile '' and `` immobile '' particles with broad tails that are well fitted by an exponential decay for large @xmath33 : @xmath72 which defines a new lengthscale @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , a close to exponential decay of the van hove function is present in the original ctrw model  @xcite when distances outside the realm of central limit theorem are considered . using a saddle - point calculation ,",
    "we have proved  @xcite analytically that eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) generically leads to broad distributions that indeed decay exponentially ( with logarithmic corrections ) . interestingly",
    "this expansion can be obtained independently of the actual shape of the distributions , establishing its universality .",
    "we have also shown  @xcite that these tails simply become enhanced in glassy materials , and are therefore more easily measured using typical experimental accuracy .    using the exact solution from eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we fit the decay of @xmath32 with an exponential function for two measurements of different precisions corresponding to @xmath74 levels of @xmath75 as in typical experiments , and of @xmath76 , which is obviously not accessible experimentally .",
    "we find that the lengthscale @xmath73 slowly increases with time , the growth being slower for the most asymptotic measurements .",
    "this suggests that if one were to measure @xmath73 for even lower values of @xmath32 , @xmath73 would be almost constant , in agreement with the saddle - point calculation .",
    "in fact , most of the time dependence of @xmath73 observed through fitting is due to the distribution crossing over , at fixed @xmath33 and increasing @xmath31 , to its long - time gaussian limit .",
    "we conclude therefore that probably the `` growing lengthscale '' @xmath73 does not carry any deep physical information .",
    "finally we remark that , quite often , the quantities @xmath77 or even @xmath78 are measured in simulations  @xcite , and the appearance of a secondary peak in @xmath52 at low temperature is given a large significance , supposedly signalling the change towards an `` activated '' dynamics with `` hopping '' processes .",
    "we would like to inform that within our ctrw model ( which is a purely `` hopping '' model ) , a secondary peak is not necessarily present .",
    "although the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 describing the tails have a maximum at some value of @xmath52 , this peak is sometimes buried below the gaussian central part of the van hove function , so that only a shoulder ( instead of a secondary maximum ) is observed .",
    "a peak emerges , for instance , when the ratio between times @xmath67 and @xmath68 is large enough , the precise limiting value depending also on the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , we believe that the observation of such peaks is not in general indicative of a deep change in the physical behaviour of the system .",
    ".[table ] fitting parameters used to get the fits shown in fig .  [ fit ] .",
    "timescales are in seconds , lengthscales in microns . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have used the model , given by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , with the four fitting parameters @xmath83 described above to fit the van hove function @xmath32 measured in our experimental system . like in our previous work with different materials showing slow dynamics  @xcite , suitable choice of the fitting parameters results in very good fits of the experimental data , as can be recognized from fig .",
    "the fitting parameters we have used are presented in table  [ table ] .    to confirm that the good agreement obtained from the model is not due to a large number of free parameters that would allow to fit any set of data , we have tried to compare our choice for the waiting times , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with the same quantities being measured directly from the observed trajectories .",
    "to do so , we must determine the `` jumps '' from our trajectories .",
    "in our experiments , we say that a particle undergoes a jump if the magnitude of its displacement between two successive experimental frames is larger than a threshold , @xmath84 .",
    "here we consider displacements only in one dimension , and use @xmath85 m , which is slightly larger than the typical lengthscale for the vibrations , @xmath86 .",
    "similar to the ctrw model , we measure two distinct timescales associated with the jumps and separately record timescales to the first jump from an arbitrary initial condition , and timescales between jumps . given that our experimental trajectories have a finite duration , we observe particles which do not jump , meaning that we probably underestimate both timescales .",
    "moreover , it needs to be noted that in the present experiment , only trajectories where at least two jumps have occured are being recorded meaning that @xmath67 is slightly more underestimated than @xmath68 in our measurements . from the statistics of the observed events , we obtain two time distributions , from which we compute the first moments , which we label as @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "we can then compare the experimental data to the results obtained through the fitting procedure , which we label as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ taudat ] .",
    "we find that the average waiting times , measured directly from experiments and by using the ctrw fitting procedure , show very similar trends when volume fraction is varied .",
    "this good agreement gives evidence that our modeling of the dynamics is physically correct , and that our fitting procedure of the van hove function indeed yields a detailed statistical information on the particle trajectories .",
    "however , the numbers for @xmath67 and @xmath68 obtained from the ctrw model are higher than the numbers extracted from experimental measurements by a factor 2 and 10 , respectively . there can be several reasons for this mismatch , which might originate from the model or from the experimental determination of waiting times , or from both .",
    "the waiting time distributions are perhaps far more complex than the exponential distributions that are used in our model .",
    "but , as mentioned above , we have good reasons to believe that waiting times are slightly underestimated in our experimental analysis , @xmath67 more than @xmath68 , a trend compatible with fig .",
    "[ taudat ] .",
    "one could also imagine the presence of back and forth motions , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ctrwfig ] , and that would erroneously be counted as jumps , again biasing the experimental waiting times towards small values , in agreement with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ taudat ] . given these possible sources of discrepancy",

    "[ taudat ] is quite satisfactory .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the heterogeneous dynamics of a colloidal system which undergoes dynamical arrest at a volume fraction intermediate between low density gels and dense glasses .",
