    "classical approaches present a population divided into susceptibles ( s ) , infectives ( i ) and recovered ( r ) , and consider interactions and transitions among these compartments .",
    "susceptibles are those hosts who either have not contracted the disease in the past or have lost immunity against the disease - causing pathogen . when a susceptible host gets in contact with an infective one , the pathogen can be transmitted from the infective to the susceptible and with a certain probability , the susceptible host becomes infective himself . after pathogen clearance the infective host recovers and becomes immune for some time , afterwards he possibly becomes susceptible again .",
    "+   + from the in - host point of view , immunity to a pathogen is the result of either active or passive immunization .",
    "the latter one is a transient protection and is due to the transmission of antibodies from the mother to the fetus through the placenta , thanks to which the newborn is immune for several months after birth @xcite .",
    "active immunization is either induced by natural infection or can be achieved by vaccine administration @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the case of natural infection . a susceptible host , also called _ naive host _",
    ", has a very low level of specific immune cells for a pathogen ( mostly a virus or a bacterium , but possibly also a fungus ) .",
    "the first response to a pathogen is nonspecific , as the innate immune system can not recognize the physical structure of the pathogen .",
    "the innate immune response slows down the initial growth of the pathogen , while the adaptive ( pathogen - specific ) immune response is activated .",
    "clonal expansion of specific immune cells ( mostly antibodies or ctl cells ) and pathogen clearance follow .",
    "the population of pathogen - specific immune cells is maintained for long time at a level that is much higher than in a naive host .",
    "these are the so - called _ memory cells _ and are activated in case of secondary infection ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : introfig1 ] ) .",
    "memory cells rapidly activate the immune response and the host mostly shows mild or no symptoms @xcite .",
    "each exposure to the pathogen might have a boosting effect on the population of specific memory cells .",
    "indeed , the immune system reacts to a new exposure as it did during primary infection , thus yielding an increased level of memory cells @xcite .",
    "though persisting for long time after pathogen clearance , the memory cell population slowly decays , and in the long run the host might lose his pathogen - specific immunity .",
    "@xcite writes that it `` is unclear for how long hosts are protected against reinfection , and this may vary from case to case . ''",
    "vaccine - induced immunity works similarly to immunity induced by the natural infection .",
    "agents contained in vaccines resemble , in a weaker form , the disease - causing pathogen and force a specific immune reaction without leading to the disease .",
    "if the vaccine is successful , the host is immunized for some time .",
    "vaccinees experience immune system boosting and waning immunity , just as hosts recovered from natural infection do . in general , however , disease - induced immunity induces a much longer lasting protection than vaccine - induced immunity does @xcite .",
    "waning immunity might be one of the factors which cause , also in highly developed regions , recurrent outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles , chickenpox and pertussis .",
    "on the other side , immune system boosting due to contact with infectives prolongs the protection duration .    in order to understand the role played by waning immunity and immune system boosting in epidemic outbreaks , in the recent past several mathematical models",
    "were proposed .",
    "few of these models describe only in - host processes which occur during and after the infection @xcite .",
    "many more models , formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , consider the problem only at population level , defining compartments for individuals with different levels of immunity and introducing transitions between these compartments @xcite .",
    "possibly , also vaccinated hosts or newborns with passive immunity are included , and waning of vaccine - induced or passive immunity are observed @xcite . in some cases , e.  g. in the model by @xcite ,",
    "a discretization of the immune status leads to a very large system of odes .",
    "simplified versions were suggested by @xcite who add the class w of hosts with waning immunity .",
    "w - hosts can receive immune system boosting due to contact with infectives or move back to the susceptible compartment due to immunity loss .",
    "@xcite extend the sirws model in @xcite , dividing each population into age - classes of length of 6 months each and further classifying immune hosts ( r ) and hosts with waning immunity ( w ) by the level of immunity .    to describe the sole waning immunity process ,",
    "authors have chosen delay differential equations ( ddes ) models with constant or distributed delay @xcite .",
    "the delay represents the average duration of the disease - induced immunity .",
    "however , neither a constant nor a distributed delay allows for the description of immune system boosting .",
    "@xcite suggest an sirs model in which infective and recovered hosts are structured by their immune status . in infective hosts the immune status increases over the course of infection , while in recovered hosts the immune status decays at some nonconstant rate . when the immune status has reached a critical level , recovered hosts transit from the immune to the susceptible compartment .",
    "+   + the goal of the present paper is to suggest a general framework for modeling waning immunity and immune system boosting in the context of population dynamics .",
    "we want to understand how the population dynamics , and in particular the number of infectives , affects waning immunity and immune system boosting in a recovered host and how , in turn , these two in - host processes influence the population dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the models proposed in @xcite , we shall maintain the number of equations as low as possible .",

    "immune system boosting is included by the mean of the probability @xmath4 , that an individual with immunity level @xmath5 moves to immunity level @xmath6 , when exposed to the pathogen .",
    "at the same time we choose the susceptible and the infective populations to be non - structured . in this way",
    "we combine a pde for the immune population with two odes for susceptible and infective hosts .",
    "the physiological structure in the immune population is the key innovation of the modeling approach , as it allows to describe at once both waning immunity ( as a natural process which occurs as time elapses ) and immune system boosting .",
