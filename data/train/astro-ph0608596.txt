    "one of the major challenges that will face gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomers is the successful discrimination between instrumental noise , stochastic gw backgrounds , and individual , resolvable gw sources .",
    "for example , the population of galactic white dwarf binaries in close orbits will provide a major contribution to the lisa noise curve in the @xmath3 mhz band @xcite . at the same time , this confusion `` noise '' can also be treated as a signal , and its shape and amplitude will provide important information about the distribution and properties of white dwarf binaries in the galaxy .    it has recently been proposed that , in the self - gravitating accretion disks of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , massive stars could form and evolve , eventually collapsing into compact objects and merging with the central black hole @xcite . at different stages in the inspiral evolution , this population will contribute to the gw background confusion or alternatively produce individual , resolvable chirp signals .",
    "it is therefore a matter of theoretical and practical interest to understand the nature of such a population .    in this paper",
    "we derive a relationship between the observable electro - magnetic ( em ) emission and the predicted gw emission from agn , following the procedures and summarizing the results outlined in our longer paper @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the hard x - ray luminosity function of ueda et al .",
    "@xcite to infer the accretion history of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) out to redshifts of @xmath4 .",
    "then we assume a few simple scaling factors , such as the average ( eddington - scaled ) accretion rate and the efficiency of converting accretion energy to x - rays , and derive the gw spectrum that might be seen by lisa .",
    "depending on the specific model parameters , we find this background could be an important class of lisa sources , similar in strength and event rates to extreme mass - ratio inspirals from captured compact objects @xcite . as in those sources , here",
    "too it is a matter of preference as to whether the background should be thought of as signal or noise .",
    "but for higher masses ( perhaps as large as @xmath5 @xcite ) , disk - embedded compact objects should produce individual , resolvable inspiral events with high signal - to - noise over a wide band of frequencies .",
    "we begin with a short discussion of notation .",
    "the results derived below include a number of dimensionless parameters , most of which can take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "we divide these parameters into two general classes : efficiencies and fractions .",
    "efficiencies , denoted by @xmath6 , are believed to be determined by more fundamental physics , and typically have more stringent lower- and upper - limits .",
    "fractions , denoted by @xmath7 , are more model - dependent parameters and less - well known than the efficiency parameters , and thus have a larger range of acceptable values .",
    "a summary of these model parameters appears in table [ glossary ] .",
    ".[glossary ] glossary of dimensionless parameters , with allowable and preferred values [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a growing consensus has been forming that smbhs grow almost exclusively by accretion , suggesting @xmath8 ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "a corollary of this assumption is that most agn should be rapidly spinning , with dimensionless spin parameters of @xmath9 , giving em efficiencies for a radiative disk of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "similarly , assuming the compact objects are on circular , adiabatic orbits , we set @xmath11 , ignoring any em or gw emission from the plunging region .",
    "we write the x - ray luminosity @xmath12 as a fraction @xmath13 of the bolometric luminosity , which in turn is a fraction @xmath14 of the eddington luminosity @xmath15 : @xmath16 the eddington limit is a function only of the smbh mass : @xmath17 . over the range of redshifts and luminosities we are probing ,",
    "typical accretion rates are estimated to be @xmath18 , but could conceivably be even greater than unity @xcite .",
    "since the energy density in the cosmic infrared background ( also dominated by agn ) is about 30 times greater than the x - ray background , we set @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "lastly , the parameter @xmath20 is the fraction of total mass accreted in the form of compact objects",
    ". since the astrophysical mechanisms that actually determine this fraction are not yet well understood , we set it to a conservative value of @xmath21 .",
    "if it were much higher , the disk would be entirely fragmented and thus not efficiently emit em radiation . and",
    "as we will see below , a value much below @xmath21 would result in a gw signal undetectable by lisa .",
    "we approximate the intrinsic ( i.e.  directly produced by the accretion process , and before reprocessing and/or partial absorption within the host galaxy ) x - ray luminosity function per comoving volume after ref .",
    "@xcite , roughly giving a broken power - law distribution with higher average luminosities at higher redshift .",
    "the fiducial values for the model parameters and the observed range of luminosities correspond to smbh masses in the range @xmath22 , consistent with the masses inferred from observations of velocity dispersions .",
    "we begin by considering the inspiral of a single compact object of mass @xmath23 onto a smbh of mass @xmath24 and specific angular momentum @xmath25 . using geometrized units such that @xmath26 , a particle on a circular , equatorial orbit around a kerr black hole has an orbital frequency ( as measured by an observer at infinity ) of @xmath27 and specific energy @xmath28",
    "thus the total energy emitted in gravitational waves down to a radius @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "the gw energy emitted between frequency @xmath7 and @xmath31 for such an event is @xmath32 here , we restrict the gw emission to the quadrupole formula for circular geodesic orbits , thus we consider only gw frequencies at twice the orbital frequencies @xmath33 .    we will generally want to restrict equation ( [ dedf ] ) to a range of frequencies @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is determined by the lisa sensitivity and @xmath36 is the gw frequency at the inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the isco frequency in turn is determined solely by the smbh mass and spin , giving @xmath37 mhz for @xmath38 . in figure [ single_inspiral ]",
    "we show the characteristic strain spectrum for a single inspiral event for a range of black hole masses and spins .",
    "integrated over redshift @xmath39 , the observed gw energy density per logarithmic frequency is given by ( e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the rate of inspiral events per comoving volume .",
    "cosmology enters with the term @xmath43^{-1}$ ] , where for a flat geometry , @xmath44^{1/2}.\\ ] ] throughout this paper we will assume a standard @xmath45cdm universe with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .    the event rate for a single agn is simply the x - ray luminosity divided by the total x - ray energy emitted between inspiral events : @xmath49 . integrating over the luminosity distribution function , we get @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the intrinsic luminosity distribution function in units of mpc@xmath52 . combining equations ( [ omega1 ] ) and ( [ r_z ] ) , the total ( time - averaged ) gravitational wave spectrum is @xmath53 the gw spectrum @xmath54 from each individual agn is a function of the smbh mass , which in turn is determined by the x - ray luminosity through equation ( [ lx ] ) .",
    "note that the integrated spectrum is independent of @xmath23 , as long as @xmath23 is small enough so that the inspiral waveform can not be individually resolved .",
    "one measure of this resolvability is the _ duty cycle _ , described in the next section .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we will want to compare directly the background defined in equation ( [ omega3 ] ) to the spectral density of the detector noise @xmath55 , which has units of inverse frequency . in this case",
    ", @xmath56 will be a dimensionless strain .",
    "averaging over the entire sky , weighted by the lisa antenna pattern , gives @xmath57 throughout the paper we use the so - called sky and detector averaged instrumental spectral density for lisa , augmented by the white - dwarf galactic confusion noise , as given in @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fiducial ] we plot the nominal gw background from equation ( [ omega3 ] ) with the model parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "also shown are the effects of varying the accretion rate @xmath14 ( fig .  [ fiducial]a ) and the fraction of accreted mass in compact objects @xmath20 ( fig.[fiducial]b ) . by increasing @xmath58 , the effect is to reduce the agn mass inferred from equation ( [ lx ] ) and thus increase the gw frequency of the signal , shifting the curves to the right . from the leading term in equation ( [ omega3 ] ) , it is clear that the total gw power is simply proportional to @xmath20 , so increasing this parameter linearly increases the total amplitude of the gw spectrum .",
    "the gw spectra calculated from equation ( [ omega3 ] ) represent the _ time - averaged _ signal from all the agn in the universe , but at any single time , there may only be a few sources that are emitting at a given frequency .",
    "this can be seen from comparing figures [ single_inspiral ] and [ fiducial ] : while the signal - to - noise ratio of a single inspiral can be very large around @xmath59 mhz , a relatively small fraction of the inspiral time is spent in that band , significantly reducing the time - averaged strain amplitude .",
    "one way of estimating the number of individual signals at a given frequency is by calculating the duty cycle @xmath60 : @xmath61 where the cosmological volume element is @xmath62 and the `` coherence time '' @xmath63 is approximated by the newtonian limit of the radiation reaction formula ( e.g.@xcite ) : @xmath64    in figure [ duty_cycle ] we show the duty cycle for the fiducial model parameters and a range of compact object masses @xmath23 .",
    "the sharp cutoff around 40 mhz is not physical , but rather due to the somewhat artificial low - end cutoff in the luminosity function , corresponding to a minimum value for @xmath65 and thus maximum attainable frequency .",
    "note that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath66 , since smaller @xmath23 means more compact objects , and also slower inspiral rates , thus each source spends more time around a given @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to understand that @xmath60 represents the total number of sources in the observable universe , not all of which would be individually resolvable with lisa . to estimate the subtractable portion of the signal , we integrate the total signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for a three - year mission lifetime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for a given @xmath23 , @xmath65 , and source distance @xmath67 , we can calculate the minimum frequency above which the source would be detectable with snr above a certain threshold ( here we use 15 ) .",
    "any contribution to equation ( [ omega3 ] ) above that frequency is ignored , resulting in an unresolvable gw spectrum , plotted in figure [ unresolvable ] .",
    "as expected , with increasing @xmath23 , more inspiral events are detectable and the remaining background confusion noise is diminished ."
