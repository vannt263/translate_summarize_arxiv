    "shortly after the realization of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) a remarkable experiment was reported @xcite , establishing becs as coherent matter waves .",
    "this experiment demonstrated ( apart from self - interference ) the interference between two becs confined in a trap , which was divided into two separate parts by means of a repulsive `` hump''-shaped potential induced by a laser beam ( usually called `` light sheet '' ) .",
    "the becs were left to expand and overlap forming interference fringes , similar to the ones known in optics .",
    "analysis of this phenomenon @xcite allowed for a quantitative understanding of some of its key features ( such as the fringe separation ) based on the mean - field theory @xcite , and in particular the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation ; the latter , can be expressed in the following dimensionless form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the condensate wavefunction ( and @xmath2 is the atom density ) , while @xmath3 is the trapping potential .",
    "in fact , this potential is also time - dependent since it has initially a double - well form ( and the condensate is allowed to relax to its ground state ) and subsequently , at @xmath4 , the `` hump '' separating the two wells is lifted ; this way , the two fractions of the bec are allowed to interfere and produce the beautiful experimental pictures observed ( see , e.g. , the observed pattern in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "such experiments and relevant theoretical studies are of particular value in this setting as they allow the study of quantum phenomena at the mesoscopic scale , but with an interesting additional twist : while the underlying quantum processes are purely linear , in the mean - field picture , inter - atomic interactions are accounted for through an effective nonlinearity [ see the last term in eq .",
    "( [ ceq1 ] ) ] that significantly enriches the linear behavior .",
    "an important modification of the linear behavior introduced by the above mentioned nonlinearity is that the underlying nonlinear gp model supports `` fundamental '' nonlinear structures in the form of matter - wave solitons and vortices .",
    "importantly , such structures , and particularly dark @xcite , bright @xcite and gap solitons @xcite , as well as vortices @xcite and vortex lattices @xcite have been observed in a series of experiments over the past decade .",
    "moreover , experimental observation of dynamical features of these structures , such as the decay of dark solitons into vortex structures @xcite has also been reported .    here , we will focus on becs with repulsive inter - atomic interactions , which support stable dark solitons and vortex structures , in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) and higher - dimensional settings respectively . in that direction , and in connection with the above setting of interfering condensates , a very interesting observation was originally reported in ref .",
    "in particular , it was numerically found that the collision of two quasi-1d bec fragments upon release of the light sheet may lead to the formation of a train of dark solitons , filling the space originally covered by the light sheet .",
    "the phase of the condensate and its jumps around the soliton locations offered undisputed evidence that this `` nonlinear interference '' leads to the formation of the relevant localized nonlinear structures .",
    "subsequent work in ref .",
    "@xcite aimed to clarify the regimes where the quasi - linear interference of the original experiments @xcite would result , versus the ones where the nonlinear interference of ref .",
    "@xcite forming dark soliton fringes , would arise .",
    "importantly , new relevant experiments were very recently reported @xcite , in which three independent becs interfered while trapped , giving rise to the formation of vortices .",
    "the latter experiment can rather naturally be characterized as a three - dimensional generalization of the original proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we revisit the nonlinear interference problem of ref .",
    "@xcite in its higher - dimensional version , relevant to two - dimensional ( 2d ) becs ( which are experimentally accessible @xcite ) , as well to fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) becs .",
    "we use appropriately crafted potentials to slice the condensate in two , as well as in _ four _ parts in 2d settings and observe their nonlinear interference in these cases .",
    "then , we fragment the 3d bec into _ two , four _ and _ eight _ pieces and examine the results of their merging as well .",
    "the main finding of the present work is that the nonlinear interference of higher - dimensional becs typically give rise to the higher - dimensional analogs of the 1d train of dark solitons .",
    "specifically , in 2d , we find nucleation of vortex - antivortex pairs and vortex necklaces ( which have previously been predicted to be formed in becs as a result of the snaking instability of ring dark solitons @xcite ) , while in 3d we find that the vortex patterns are replaced by vortex ring ones .",
    "the patterns created by the collision of different bec slices become more complex for larger numbers of slices . in examining the robustness of the relevant mechanism",
    ", we also explore the role ( in the vortex formation process ) of the relative phases of the different fragments , as well as those of dissipation ( emulating the interaction of the condensate with a non - condensed atom fraction ) and of the time for ramping down the barrier separating the fragments .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ 2d ] , we present the 2d version of the problem : the condensate is separated into two fragments by a light sheet and then allowed to collide ( after light sheet removal ) , producing vortex structures . in sec .  [ 2d ] , we also present results pertaining to the collision of four fragments separated by a light `` cross '' . next , in sec .",
    "[ 3d ] , we systematically study the 3d case and interpret the corresponding findings for , respectively , two , four and eight condensate fragments . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize and present our conclusions , as well as discuss some interesting aspects meriting future study .",
    "in the 2d case , we propose two different experimentally feasible situations . in the more standard one , i.e. , the direct analog of the 1d case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the potential in eq .",
    "( [ ceq1 ] ) reads @xmath5 where , for the 2d case , @xmath6 v_{\\rm ls}(x , y ) & = & v_0\\ , { \\rm sech}(by ) , \\label{mtsl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 represents the harmonic trapping potential ( with @xmath8 being the normalized trap strength ) , while @xmath9 is a localized repulsive potential describing the light sheet ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 representing the normalized intensity and inverse width of the laser beam ) .",
    "note that , similarly to the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of @xmath7 is necessary to guarantee nonlinear interference of the two condensate fractions separated by the light sheet potential @xmath9 ( the latter pushes the bec atoms away from the vicinity of the line @xmath12 ) .",
    "0.0 cm ( a ) 8.6 cm ( b ) +             in the case under consideration , the ground state of the system has the form shown in the top left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1].a , namely two identical condensate fragments separated by the light sheet .",
    "this ground state is obtained by relaxation ( imaginary time integration ) starting from a thomas - fermi cloud with density @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the chemical potential that will be set to unity in what follows .",
    "our proposed experiment assumes that the condensate , confined in the the potential of eq .",
    "( [ ceq2 ] ) is in the ground state at @xmath4 , and that both fragments share the _ same _ phase ( see below for a description when fragments have deferent phases ) .",
    "then , at that time , @xmath4 , we `` lift '' ( i.e. , switch - off ) the light sheet by setting @xmath15 , and subsequently let the system evolve according to the gp eq .",
    "( [ ceq1 ] ) .",
    "notice that this is the direct generalization in 2d of the setup proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . during the evolution , the two fragments originally constituting the condensate expand , and eventually interfere [ see later times in the left column of fig .  [ fig2d_1](a ) ] . in order to quantify the amount of vorticity generated by the collision of the different fragments we monitor the vorticity @xmath16 [ @xmath17 corresponds to @xmath18 in the 2d simulations and @xmath19 in the 3d simulations ] .",
    "the vorticity is calculated as the curl of the fluid velocity , @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where the fluid velocity is given by : @xmath22 the typical numerical experiment showing the collision between two fragments with same initial phase ( @xmath23 , see below ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](a ) is performed for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this choice corresponds , e.g. , to a pancake sodium bec , containing @xmath27 atoms , and confined in a trap with frequencies @xmath28hz and @xmath29hz . on the other hand ,",
    "the light sheet parameters may correspond , e.g. , to a blue - detuned laser beam providing a maximum barrier energy of @xmath30  nk .",
    "note that the phenomenology that will be presented below does not change for the more realistic case of smaller trap strengths @xmath8 , which leads to larger numbers of atoms .    through the interference ,",
    "quasi-1d `` nonlinear '' fringes are formed , i.e. , dark stripes ( see atom density at @xmath31 in the left panel of fig .  [ fig2d_1].a ) resembling dark solitons ( in direct analogy to the 1d case ) , but now in the 2d setting .",
    "however , it is well - known that such 1d stripes are unstable in 2d ( and 3d ) towards transverse modulations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . as a result of the ensuing snaking instability , such stripes break up into vortex - antivortex pairs ( because the original zero vorticity of the solution needs to be preserved ) .",
    "this is precisely what happens in our case as well .",
    "the bending of the stripes [ see the atom density at @xmath32 in fig .  [ fig2d_1](a ) ] is responsible for the break up into four vortex pairs as is shown in vorticity plot at @xmath32 . as the dark stripes continue bending and mixing ,",
    "a series of vortex pair nucleations and annihilations occur .    to follow this evolution , we depict in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](a ) a space - time plot of the vorticity .",
    "the main evolution of the vorticity can be summarized as follows . at @xmath33 four vortices ( i.e. , two vortex pairs ) nucleate .",
    "two more quartets of vortices are nucleated at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . at @xmath36 the first quartet merges and",
    "is annihilated .",
    "the second quartet merges at @xmath37 .",
    "this process of merging and spontaneous nucleation of vortex pairs and quartets remains active for long times ( data not shown here ) .",
    "0.0 cm ( a ) 8.6 cm ( b ) +               in actual bec experiments ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) the condensate is grown inside the _ combined _ harmonic trap @xmath7 and light sheet potential @xmath9 .",
    "there are two distinct regimes depending on the strength of the light sheet : if the light sheet strength is weak , the fragments have enough overlap and maintain a common phase , however , for stronger light sheets , the fragments grow essentially independently carrying their own independent ( random ) phases .",
    "another possibility in the experiment is to grow a condensate in the harmonic trap alone and then split the condensate into fragments by adiabatically ramping up the light sheet .",
    "depending on the degree of adiabaticity and , more importantly , on the time the fragments are kept separate before releasing the light sheet , the phases of the different fragments will evolve independently and assume , effectively , random phases . here , we explore the effects of such phase differences between the condensate fragments .",
    "we therefore consider the case where just before the light sheet release the phase of the top ( bottom ) fragment is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . without loss of generality we fix @xmath40 and we focus on the phase difference between the condensates @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](b ) we depict the collision of two fragments as in fig .  [ fig2d_1](a ) but with a different initial relative phase between the condensates of @xmath42 . in the simulations ,",
    "initial configurations with arbitrary phase differences @xmath43 were achieved by using the steady state solution found for @xmath23 as before , then applying a phase shift of @xmath43 to the bottom fragment ( i.e. , for @xmath44 ) , and running again the relaxation scheme ( imaginary time integration ) until convergence .",
    "the results presented in figs .  [ fig2d_1](a ) and [ fig2d_1](b ) indicate that the detailed evolution of the vortex formation and merging depends on the relative phases of the condensates .",
    "in fact , further numerical results with phase differences between @xmath23 and @xmath42 show similar vortex formation and annihilation with vortex `` activity '' decreasing ( both in terms of the number of vortices produced and the persistence time of the structures ) as @xmath43 was increased from 0 to @xmath45 ( results not shown here ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dynamics for phase differences different from zero loses its four - fold symmetry when compared to the @xmath23 case . in all cases that we tried ,",
    "vortex pairs are nucleated at some point in the simulation irrespective of @xmath43 .",
    "however , it is evident from the figures that the smaller the phase difference between the fragments , the more vortex structures are nucleated and the longer they live .",
    "in fact , the extreme case of a @xmath42 between fragments barely produces any vortex pairs [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](b ) ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial condition is close to a steady - state domain - wall ( dark soliton stripe separating out of phase domains ) and thus there is little extra energy for the collision of the fragments . indeed , as it can be evidenced from fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](b ) ( where @xmath42 ) , the condensate always maintains a configuration similar to a domain - wall with some perturbations : the density always shows a nudge at @xmath12 and there is a predominant phase difference of @xmath45 between the upper and lower half planes .",
    "the gp model used above relies , by construction , on the mean - field description of a boson gas at extremely low temperatures and becomes exact at @xmath46 .",
    "when the temperature is finite , but still below the critical temperature @xmath47 for bec formation , there exists a fraction of atoms that is not condensed , the so - called thermal cloud .",
    "this thermal cloud is in fact coupled to the condensed gas and its presence produces effects that are not accounted for by the gp equation ( cf .",
    "the insightful review in chap .",
    "18 of ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "phenomenologically , one of the most noticeable effects of the presence of a sizeable thermal cloud is the introduction of damping ( to the condensed gas ) .",
    "the approach of adding phenomenological damping to emulate thermal effects was originally proposed by pitaevskii @xcite and applied with a position - dependent loss rate in ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice ,",
    "a few different implementations for the phenomenological damping are viable . here , we follow the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite where the gp equation is modified by the inclusion of a damping term , thus taking the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the damping rate ( the chemical potential is again fixed at @xmath50 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2d_damp ] we display the collision of two fragments as in fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](a ) ( i.e. , same initial phase , @xmath23 ) for two values of damping .",
    "figures  [ fig2d_damp](a ) and [ fig2d_damp](b ) correspond to the cases of weak ( @xmath51 ) and strong ( @xmath52 ) damping . for the above choices , it is relevant to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the value @xmath53 corresponds to a temperature of about @xmath54 .",
    "as it can be observed from the figure , the case of weak damping [ @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2d_damp](a ) ] behaves qualitatively the same as the case without damping [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2d_1](a ) ] until about @xmath55 , when a noticeable reduction in the generated vorticity sets in .",
    "this effect is even more dramatic for larger damping [ @xmath52 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2d_damp](b ) ] where it can be seen that after @xmath56 there is a complete absence of vortices .",
    "the effect of damping can be easily , qualitatively , understood in that the added phenomenological dissipation slows the fragments in their collisions and , therefore , less vorticity is produced .",
    "we also studied the effect of ramp - down time of the laser sheet separating the different condensate fragments . in current experiments ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the barrier created by the laser sheet can be removed using a gradual ramp - down of the laser intensity .",
    "simulations ( not show here ) reveal that slower ramping - down times have similar suppressing effects on vortex formation to the phenomenological damping cases described above .",
    "in fact , this is also for similar reasons , namely that longer ramping - down times induce a slowing down of the fragments and hence the production of less vorticity .",
    "a more detailed study of the effects of ramp - down times on the vortex nucleation is beyond the scope of the present manuscript and will be reported in a separate publication @xcite .",

    "[ fig2d_quad ] ) .",
    "subsequently , as the `` light cross '' is lifted at @xmath4 , the fragments attempt to fill in the empty space , resulting in an interference pattern with four - fold symmetry .",
    "the oscillation and ensuing bending of the resulting dark stripes results in a rich evolution of vortex pairs as it can be evidenced by the space - time plot of the vorticity in the right panel of fig .",

    "notice that for this initial condition , more exotic patterns , including _ vortex necklaces _ ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and structures with a higher number of vortices are formed .",

    "@xcite , with a harmonic trapping potential @xmath60 and a light sheet potential of the form @xmath61 we use @xmath62 , in the typical results of fig .  [ fig3d_1 ] , leading to the fragmentation of the initial condition into two pieces as is shown for @xmath4 .",
    "once the single light sheet of the potential of eq .",
    "( [ ceq5 ] ) is lifted , interference ensues among the different condensate fragments ( see snapshots at @xmath63 ) . as the two fragments get closer , pairs of _ vortex rings _ are nucleated between the fragments .",
    "it is interesting to observe that these vortex rings , created in pairs ( recall that our system conserves angular momentum ) around the condensate ( as smoke rings that are created at the edge of the flow tube ) , may travel inward and `` pinch '' the condensate promoting its fragmentation .",

    "in particular , we observe the formation of vortex rings around the condensate that promote the `` pinching '' of the different interference fragments .",
    "it is very interesting to note that for longer times ( @xmath70 ) a recurrent evolution emerges whereby a cage of vortex rings surrounds the bulk of the condensate atoms ( cf .",

    "again we find that vortex rings are created in pairs around the condensate and subsequently migrate inward promoting the `` pinching '' of the interference pattern .",

    "the 3d setting is particularly interesting , since the 2d vortex patterns are replaced by vortex ring ones .",
    "we find that these vortex rings , upon nucleating in pairs around the condensate , migrate inward promoting the `` pinching '' of the different interference patterns .",
    "subsequently the condensate evolves under a complex pattern of nucleation and annihilation of vortex rings .",

    "<S> we study the formation of vortices , vortex necklaces and vortex ring structures as a result of the interference of higher - dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study is motivated by earlier theoretical results pertaining to the formation of dark solitons by interfering quasi one - dimensional becs , as well as recent experiments demonstrating the formation of vortices by interfering higher - dimensional becs . here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the genericity of the relevant scenario , but also highlight a number of additional possibilities emerging in higher - dimensional settings . </S>",
    "<S> a relevant example is , e.g. , the formation of a `` cage '' of vortex rings surrounding the three - dimensional bulk of the condensed atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the relative phases of the different bec fragments and the role of damping due to coupling with the thermal cloud are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions should be immediately tractable in currently existing experimental bec setups . </S>"
