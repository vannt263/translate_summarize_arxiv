    "the spectrum of cosmic rays extends in energy up to almost @xmath1  ev .",
    "about twenty mysterious events were observed above 10@xmath3  ev by five different air shower observatories ( agasa  @xcite , fly s eye  @xcite , haverah park  @xcite , hires  @xcite , and yakutsk  @xcite ) .",
    "though some small - angle clustering in the arrival direction of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is observed , the overall event distribution is isotropic .",
    "this indicates that they originate from several , isotropically distributed sources .",
    "nucleons produced at large distances with energies above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite @xmath4@xmath5  ev interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and produce pions which decay into neutrinos . this way the nucleons lose their energy during propagation .",
    "the typical interaction length of nucleons above @xmath6 is around @xmath7  mpc .",
    "thus all events above @xmath8  ev should originate from small distances .",
    "however , no source within a distance of @xmath7  mpc is known in the arrival directions of the post - gzk events .",
    "the angular distribution of uhecrs above @xmath4 does not show a correlation with our galactic plane which also indicates that they originate from large distances .",
    "no conventional explanation exists to the problem how can they reach us with energies above @xmath8  ev without an apparent energy loss . at the relevant energies , among the known particles",
    "only neutrinos can propagate without significant energy loss from cosmological distances to us .",
    "it is this fact which led , on the one hand , to scenarios invoking hypothetical  beyond the standard model  strong interactions of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos  @xcite and , on the other hand , to the z - burst scenario  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the flux of neutrinos coming from the pions produced during the propagation of nucleons  the cosmogenic neutrinos  @xcite  shows a nice agreement with the observed uhecr flux above @xmath6  @xcite . assuming a large enough neutrino - nucleon cross - section at these high energies",
    ", these neutrinos could initiate extensive air showers high up in the atmosphere , like hadrons , and explain the existence of the post - gzk events .",
    "this large cross - section is usually ensured by new types of tev - scale interactions beyond the standard model , such as arising through gluonic bound state leptons  @xcite , tev - scale grand unification with leptoquarks  @xcite , or kaluza - klein modes from compactified extra dimensions  @xcite ( see , however , ref .",

    "it exploits non - perturbative electroweak instanton - induced processes for the interaction of cosmogenic neutrinos with nucleons in the atmosphere , which may have a sizeable cross - section above a threshold energy @xmath9  ev , where @xmath10 denotes the w - boson mass and @xmath11 the electroweak fine structure constant  @xcite .",
    "we present a detailed statistical analysis of the agreement between observations and predictions from strongly interacting neutrino scenarios .",
    "our scenario is based on a standard power - like primary spectrum of protons injected from sources at cosmological distances .",
    "after propagation , these protons will have energies below @xmath6 , so they can well describe the low energy part of the uhecr spectrum .",
    "the cosmogenic neutrinos interact with the atmosphere and thus give a second component to the uhecr flux , which describes the high energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the relative normalization of the proton and neutrino fluxes is fixed in this scenario , so the low and high energy parts of the spectrum are explained simultaneously without any extra normalization .",
    "details of this analysis can be found in ref .",

    "the structure of this review is as follows . in the next section",

    ". the overall normalization @xmath17 will be fixed by the observed flux , and our predictions are quite insensitive to the specific choice for @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , within their anticipated values .",

    "ii ) _ we multiplied the corresponding infinitesimal probabilities starting at a distance @xmath47 down to earth with @xmath48 .",
    "since the propagation functions are of universal usage , we decided to make the latest versions of @xmath49 available for the public via the world - wide - web url www.desy.de/~uhecr .",

    "such suddenly increasing cross - sections have been proposed in various models involving physics beyond the standard model  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ cross - nun ] we show another example which is based entirely on the standard model exploiting non - perturbative electroweak instanton - induced processes  @xcite . our quantitative analysis  @xcite was based on this cross - section , however it is expected to be insensitive to the exact form of it as long as it rises abruptly far above 1  mb .",
    "note that such a behaviour is consistent with present upper bounds on electroweak instanton - induced cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such a cross - section will lead , via dispersion relations , to lower energy deviations of standard model predictions for elastic scattering from their perturbative values .",
    "however , it is easily checked that , for the one shown in fig .",
    "[ cross - nun ] ( left ) , these corrections will be unobservably small in the energy regime available at present accelerators  @xcite .",
    "the predicted air shower rate induced by protons and neutrinos is given by @xmath64 we performed a statistical analysis to compare ( [ flux - pred ] ) with the observations and presented a measure for the goodness of the scenario  @xcite .",
    "we gave the best fit to the observations and the 1- and 2-sigma confidence regions in the ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) plane .",
    "uhecr collaborations usually publish their results for the detected fluxes in a binned form .",
    "the first step of our analysis is to convert these fluxes into event numbers in each bin .",
    "we use the most recent results of the hires and agasa collaborations and do our analysis separately with both data sets .",
    "we use the energy range @xmath65  ev ",
    "ev which is divided into 38 equal logarithmic bins . in the low energy region , there are no published results available from agasa and only low statistics results from hires-2 .",
    "therefore , we included the results of the predecessor collaborations ",
    "akeno  @xcite and fly s eye , respectively  into the analysis .",
    "the goodness of the scenario is determined by a statistical analysis .",
    "we determined the compatibility of different ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) pairs with the experimental data .",
    "for some fixed ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) pair , the expected number of events in individual bins are ( @xmath66 with @xmath26 being the total number of bins ( in our case 38 ) .",
    "the probability of getting an experimental outcome @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 are non - negative integer numbers ) is given by the probability distribution function @xmath69 , which is just the product of poisson distributions for the individual bins .",
    "it is easy to include also the @xmath70 overall energy uncertainty into the @xmath69 probability distribution .",
    "we denote the experimental result by @xmath71 , where the @xmath72-s are non - negative , integer numbers .",
    "the ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) pair is compatible with the experimental results if @xmath73 for a 1-(or 2-)sigma compatibility one takes c=0.68 ( or c=0.95 ) , respectively .",
    "the best fit is found by minimizing the sum on the left hand side .",
    "since we have 38 variables , it is practically impossible to calculate the sum in equation ( [ summation ] ) exactly . if we rewrite it as @xmath74 \\over \\sum_{{\\bf k } } p({\\bf k})}\\,,\\ ] ] then we can calculate this sum approximately using an importance sampling based monte - carlo technique .",
    "we have to generate the components of @xmath75 with poisson distribution and take only those in the sum , for which @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fit ] ( left ) shows our best fits for the agasa and for the hires uhecr data .",
    "the best fit values are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , for agasa(hires ) .",
    "we can see very nice agreement with the data within an energy range of nearly four orders of magnitude .",
    "the fits are insensitive to the value of @xmath18 as far as we choose a value above @xmath79  ev .",
    "the shape of the curve between @xmath0  ev and @xmath80  ev is mainly determined by the redshift evolution index @xmath15 . at these energies",
    "the universe is already transparent for protons created at @xmath81 while protons from sources with larger redshift accumulate in this region .",
    "the peak around @xmath82  ev shows the accumulation of particles due to the gzk effect .",
    "neutrinos start to dominate over protons at around @xmath8  ev .",
    "it is important to note that , if we omit the neutrino component , then the model is ruled out on the 3-sigma level for both experiments .",
    "this is due to the fact that we excluded nearby sources by setting @xmath83 ( see also ref .",
    "a choice of @xmath84 makes the hires data compatible with a proton - only scenario on the 2-sigma level ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    figure  [ fit ] ( right ) displays the confidence regions in the ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) plane for agasa and hires .",
    "the scenario is consistent on the 2-sigma level with both experiments . for hires ,",
    "the compatibility is even true on the 1-sigma level .",
    "it is important to note that both experiments favor the same values for @xmath13 and @xmath15 , demonstrating their mutual compatibility on the 2-sigma level ( see also ref .",
    "finally , let us discuss the consistency of our scenario with the currently available limits on deeply penetrating showers from fly s eye  @xcite and agasa  @xcite .",
    "taking into account  in distinction to ref .",
    "@xcite  the atmospheric attenuation of the cosmogenic neutrino flux predicted in our scenario and the uncertainties in the estimate of the range of depth within which the shower must originate to trigger the array , we find that agasa should have seen @xmath46 quasi - horizontal air showers ( @xmath85 ) from the electroweak instanton - induced processes during a running time of @xmath86  days .",
    "this is consistent with agasa s present analysis of their respective data  @xcite .",
    "the fly s eye upper limit on the product of the total neutrino flux times neutrino - nucleon cross - section , @xmath87  @xcite , in the energy range @xmath88  ev , can be translated , for a given predicted neutrino flux @xmath89 , into an upper limit on @xmath90 , as long as it is smaller than @xmath91  @xmath92b  @xcite .",
    "we find that , for our predicted cosmogenic neutrino flux , the right - hand - side of this inequality is larger than @xmath91  @xmath92b in the whole energy range , such that the fly s eye non - observation of quasi - horizontal air showers does not give any constraint .",
    "we therefore conclude that our prediction of the neutrino - nucleon cross - section , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cross - nun ] ( left ) , does not contradict any constraints from cosmic ray experiments so far , as long as the ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux is at the cosmogenic level we have predicted .",
    "we have shown that a simple scenario with a single power - like injection spectrum of protons can describe all the features of the uhecr spectrum in the energy range @xmath93  ev . in our scenario ,",
    "the injected protons produce neutrinos during their propagation and these neutrinos are assumed to have large enough cross - section to produce air showers high up in the atmosphere . as an example we discussed the possibility that standard model electroweak instanton - induced processes may give a cross section which is suitable for this scenario .",
    "the model has few parameters from which only two  the power index @xmath13 and the redshift evolution index @xmath15  has a strong effect on the final shape of the spectrum .",
    "we found that for certain values of @xmath13 and @xmath15 this scenario is compatible with the available observational data from the agasa and hires experiments ( combined with their predecessor experiments , fly s eye and akeno , respectively ) on the 2-sigma level ( also 1-sigma for hires ) .",
    "the ultrahigh energy neutrino component can be experimentally tested by studying the zenith angle dependence of the events in the range @xmath94  ev and possible correlations with distant astrophysical sources  @xcite at cosmic ray facilities such as the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , and by looking for enhanced rates for throughgoing muons at neutrino telescopes such as amanda  @xcite . as laboratory tests ,",
    "one may search for a model - independent enhancement in ( quasi-)elastic lepton - nucleon scattering  @xcite or for signatures of qcd instanton - induced processes in deep - inelastic scattering  @xcite , e.g. at hera .",
