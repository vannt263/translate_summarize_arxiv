    "mathematical models are now commonly used in the study of growth of cell tissue . for instance , a wide literature is now available on the study of the tumor growth through mathematical modeling and numerical simulations @xcite . in such models , we may distinguish two kinds of description : either they describe the dynamics of cell population density ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or they consider the geometric motion of the tissue through a free boundary problem of hele - shaw type ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently the link between both descriptions has been investigated from a mathematical point of view thanks to an incompressible limit @xcite .    in this paper , we depart from the simplest cell population model as proposed in @xcite . in this model the dynamics of the cell density is driven by pressure forces and cell multiplication .",
    "more precisely , let us denote by @xmath0 the cell density depending on time @xmath1 and position @xmath2 , and by @xmath3 the mechanical pressure .",
    "the mechanical pressure depends only on the cell density and is given by a state law @xmath4 .",
    "cell proliferation is modelled by a pressure - limited growth function denoted @xmath5 .",
    "mechanical pressure generates cells displacement with a velocity whose field @xmath6 is computed thanks to the darcy s law .",
    "after normalizing all coefficients , the model reads @xmath7 the choice @xmath8 has been taken in @xcite .",
    "this choice allows to recover the well - known porous medium equation for which a lot of nice mathematical properties are now well - established ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the incompressible limit is then obtained by letting @xmath9 going to @xmath10 .",
    "however , this state law does not prevent cells to overlap .",
    "in fact , it is not possible with this choice to avoid the cell density to take value above @xmath11 ( which corresponds here to the maximal packing density after normalization ) . a convenient way to avoid cells",
    "overlapping is to consider a pressure law which becomes singular when the cell density approaches @xmath11 .",
    "such type of singularity is encountered , for instance , in the kinetic theory of dense gases where the interaction between molecules is strongly repulsive at very short distance @xcite .",
    "similar singular pressure laws have been also considered in @xcite to model collective motion , in @xcite to model the traffic flow , and in @xcite to model crowd motion ( see also the review article @xcite ) .",
    "then , in order to fit this non - overlapping constraint , we consider the following simple model of pressure law given by @xmath12    finally , the model under study in this paper reads , for @xmath13 , @xmath14 this system is complemented by an initial data denoted @xmath15 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the incompressible limit of this model , which consists in letting @xmath16 going to @xmath17 in the latter system .    at this stage",
    ", it is of great importance to observe that from , we may deduce an equation for the pressure by simply multiplying by @xmath18 and using the relation @xmath19 from , @xmath20 formally , we deduce from that when @xmath21 , we expect to have the relation @xmath22 moreover , passing formally to the limit into , it appears clearly that @xmath23 .",
    "we deduce from this relation that if we introduce the set @xmath24 , then we obtain a free boundary problem of hele - shaw type : on @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 , whereas @xmath28 on @xmath29 .",
    "thus although the pressure law is different , we expect to recover the same free boundary hele - shaw model as in @xcite .",
    "the incompressible limit of the above cell mechanical model for tumor growth with a pressure law given by @xmath30 has been investigated in @xcite and in @xcite when taking into account active motion of cells . in @xcite , the case with viscosity , where the darcy s law is replaced by the brinkman s law ,",
    "is studied .",
    "we mention also the recent works @xcite where the incompressible limit with more general assumptions on the initial data has been investigated .",
    "however , in all these mentionned works the pressure law do not prevent the non - overlapping of cells .",
    "up to our knowledge , this work is the first attempt to extend the previous result with this constraint , i.e. with a singular pressure law as given by .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "in the next section we give the statement of the main result in theorem [ th1 ] , which is the convergence when @xmath16 goes to @xmath17 of the mechanical model  towards the hele - shaw free boundary system .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of this result .",
    "first , in section [ sec : estim ] we establish some a priori estimate allowing to obtain space compactness .",
    "then , section [ sec : tcompact ] is devoted to the study of the time compactness .",
    "thanks to compactness results , we can pass to the limit @xmath21 in system  in section [ sec : conv ] , up to the extraction of a subsequence .",
    "finally the proof of the complementary relation is performed in section [ sec : compl ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish the incompressible limit @xmath31 of the cell mechanical model with non - overlapping constraint . before stating our main result , we list the set of assumptions that we use on the growth fonction and on the initial data . for the growth function ,",
    "we assume @xmath32 } |g'| = \\gamma,\\\\           & \\exists\\ , p_m>0 , \\quad g(p_m)=0 .        \\end{aligned }      \\right.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath33 , for which the growth stops , is commonly called the homeostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "this set of assumptions on the growth function is quite similar to the one in @xcite , except for the bound on the growth term which is needed here due to the singularity in the pressure law .    for the initial data ,",
    "we assume that there exists @xmath34 such that for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 notice that this set of assumptions imply that @xmath15 is uniformly bounded in @xmath37 .",

    "we notice that we recover the same limit model whose uniqueness has already been stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) .",
    "although our proof follows the idea in @xcite , several technical difficulties must be overcome due to the singularity of the pressure law .",
    "indeed , we first recall that with the choice @xmath30 , equation may be rewritten as the porous medium equation @xmath51 .",
    "a lot of estimates are known and well established for this equation ( see @xcite ) , in particular a semiconvexity estimate is used in @xcite which allows to obtain estimate on the time derivative and thus compactness . with our choice of pressure law , should be consider as a fast diffusion equation .",
    "thus we have first to state a comparison principle to obtain a priori estimates ( see lemma [ lem : estim ] ) . unlike in @xcite",
    ", we may not use a semiconvexity estimate to obtain estimate on the time derivative . to do so",
