    "the most energetically favourable arrangement of low - density electrons in an infinite two - dimensional plane is the ordered triangular wigner lattice @xcite where each electron is surrounded by six equidistant nearest neighbours .",
    "however , in most instances of contemporary interest one deals instead with finite clusters of strongly interacting particles localized in potential traps .",
    "for example , extensively studied realizations of finite - size two - dimensional wigner crystallites are created by trapping charged micrometric particles formed in the complex plasma environment @xcite . confined geometries inevitably lead to deviations from the perfect triangular structure .",
    "presence of lattice imperfections plays a key role in determination of physical properties of both macroscopic @xcite and low - dimensional mesoscopic systems .",
    "it has been argued that lattice faults are important in the shape changing processes during the maturation of capsides of spherical viruses @xcite , cell division , and growth of bacterial surface layers @xcite .",
    "intrinsic defects have a major impact on the collective particle motion and the inhomogeneous melting of two - dimensional coulomb clusters in circular confinement @xcite and straight narrow channels @xcite .    the topological charge",
    " also known as the disclination charge  of a site in a distorted lattice is defined as @xmath0 ; here @xmath1 is the actual coordination number ( the number of nearest neighbours ) and @xmath2 is the reference value pertaining to the perfect lattice . for sites that belong to the bulk of the cluster @xmath3 , while for those situated on the edge @xmath4 .",
    "the topological charges of all sites in a two - dimensional cluster must sum up to six , a topological invariant due to the euler s theorem @xcite .",
    "in a recent work @xcite topological defects and defect complexes were investigated in the thomson model @xcite , featuring a fixed number of particles moving on the surface of a sphere and interacting through repulsive coulomb forces . in a quasi - three - dimensional geometry defined by the spherical surface",
    "the total disclination charge must equal twelve @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in systems consisting of @xmath5 particles or more , isolated defects cost too much strain energy , and thus , various defect complexes are formed .",
    "the most intriguing of the lot are the so - called _ rosette _ defects consisting of a central five - coordinated site ( topological charge @xmath6 ) surrounded by a layer of five seven - coordinated sites ( @xmath7 ) , and a further layer of five five - coordinated sites .",
    "the total disclination charge of this compound is @xmath8 .",
    "thus , highly symmetric configurations with @xmath9 rosettes arranged on a sphere must be possible and were indeed reported in reference @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is a comprehensive study and classification of topological defects in a two - dimensional coulomb cluster  a mesoscopic system , known for its applicability to a broad range of experimental problems , namely , the distribution of electron islands on the surface of liquid helium @xcite , electrons in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite and charged micrometric spheres in the complex plasma environment @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a given number of identical charged particles confined by an isotropic parabolic potential trap .",
    "the confinement gives rise to the presence of topological defects .",
    "the number , structure and distribution of defects , or defect complexes , strongly depends on the system size and its energetic state .    as a matter of fact , in large coulomb clusters an exponentially large number of stable configurations",
    "are possible @xcite .",
    "the one with the lowest energy is called the ground state and is , of course , the most special and interesting configuration .",
    "however , metastable states are also realized in experiments @xcite and should not be neglected .",
    "therefore , we do not restrict our attention to the ground states but investigate the whole spectrum , mostly focusing on its low - energy part .",
    "we use the term _ low - energy states _ to refer to the states whose energies fall within the bottom @xmath10 of the energy interval covered by all discovered metastable states .",
    "the presence of a large number of competing metastable states is also a computational issue .",
    "various methods have been tried striving to locate the ground state as well as metastable configurations of large clusters .",
    "simulated annealing @xcite , genetic algorithms @xcite and basin hopping @xcite are a few significant examples . in the present work ,",
    "we rely on the recently proposed minima hopping method @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is designed to avoid revisiting already known configurations and employs low - energy molecular dynamics escape trajectories to reach neighbouring energy minima from a given one .",
    "the minima hopping method was shown to be efficient in locating ground states of complex molecular systems @xcite , and with the present contribution we test its performance on strongly coupled coulomb systems .    the paper is organized as follows . in , we introduce the model and the computational scheme .",
    "the three subsections of are devoted to discussion and classification of the obtained defect compounds and their impact on the orientational order of the wigner lattice .",
    "we end with a concluding .",
    "the model system consists of @xmath11 identical particles of mass @xmath12 and electrostatic charge @xmath13 , restricted to move in a two - dimensional plane and laterally confined by a circular parabolic potential .",
    "the total potential energy of the system is given by @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is a two - dimensional vector denoting the position of the @xmath16-th particle and @xmath17 is the distance between two of them .",
    "the first term of represents the parabolic confinement with the characteristic frequency @xmath18 , while the second term corresponds to the coulomb interparticle repulsion . introducing the units of length @xmath19 and energy @xmath20 , we rewrite the potential energy in a simple dimensionless and parameter - free form @xmath21 to find the low - energy stable states of the cluster",
    ", we use the minima hopping algorithm @xcite .",
    "since application of this algorithm is novel in this context , we begin with a brief outline .    initially , the system is placed into one of the known minima and the algorithm starts by performing a short molecular dynamics simulation that attempts to escape from the basin of attraction of the current minimum .",
    "the particles are assigned random velocities according to the maxwell distribution scaled in such a way that their total kinetic energy adds up to the current value of @xmath22 , a dynamically adjustable simulation parameter .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulation proceeds keeping track of the instantaneous value of the potential energy , and is stopped immediately after its @xmath23-th minimum along the simulation path is reached . in the simplest version of the algorithm ,",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is set to unity , that is , the nearest minimum is sought .",
    "however , one may often wish to skip some minima along the trajectory , and such an opportunity is provided by using larger values of @xmath23 .",
    "once the molecular dynamics simulation is stopped , the geometry minimization takes over and the system is forced to roll down towards the closest minimum .",
    "this step is accomplished by a combination of the steepest descent and newton s optimization techniques .",
    "there are three possible outcomes of the described simulation .",
    "if the kinetic energy @xmath22 is insufficient to overcome the surrounding potential barriers and/or the parameter @xmath23 is not large enough to find a low - energy escape path , the system rolls back to the same minimum . in the second case , the new minimum turns out to be visited previously .",
    "if any of these two outcomes is reached , the kinetic energy of the system is increased by a respective factor @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( see below ) and a new more vigorous attempt is launched from the same minimum .",
    "the third and most desirable case is realized when the obtained minimum is a new one and has not been visited previously .    to introduce a preference for steps that reduce the total potential energy ,",
    "the new configuration is accepted only if the increase in the potential energy does not exceed the threshold value @xmath26 , another dynamically adjustable parameter . if the newly found minimum is accepted , the kinetic energy of the system @xmath22 is lowered and the following cycle is started from the new minimum .    the simulation is stopped after @xmath22 increases significantly .",
    "this happens when the simulation is unable to produce any new minima for a long time , which implies that the lowest minima have been found .",
    "the behaviour of the energies @xmath22 and @xmath26 is governed by five control parameters .",
    "the factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 determine how fast @xmath26 is increased ( decreased ) after a new minimum is rejected ( accepted ) .",
    "the factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 multiply the kinetic energy @xmath22 according to the outcome of an escape attempt , and must be chosen close to unity in order to sample the phase space thoroughly . in our simulations",
    "we follow @xcite and use @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , @xmath23 determines the number of minima along the molecular dynamics path before the geometry relaxation takes over .",
    "the success of the algorithm is based on the validity of the bell - evans - polanyi principle @xcite which states that highly exothermic chemical reactions have a low activation energy . in other words ,",
    "low - energy local minima are more likely to be located behind low potential barriers , and this is the reason to keep the kinetic energy as low as possible . having performed some test runs we verified that the minima hopping algorithm never fails to find the true ground state of a three - dimensional coulomb cluster with @xmath32 particles and the thomson problem with @xmath33 .",
    "we further investigated the performance of the minima hopping algorithm in the case of a two - dimensional @xmath34-particle cluster .",
    "this cluster has a symmetric ground state that controls a rather small basin of attraction and @xmath35 metastable states known from the previous work @xcite .",
    "thus , the search for the ground state is not a simple task .",
    "the algorithm starts at a randomly chosen initial minimum and runs until the true ground state is reached . to collect reliable statistics , the whole simulation is repeated @xmath36 times .",
    "the total number of the algorithm steps @xmath37 needed to reach the ground state strongly depends on the value of @xmath23 and correlates with the average kinetic energy of the system @xmath38 during the course of the simulation . from",
    "we observe that larger values of the parameter @xmath23 result in lower values of @xmath38 and a significant decrease of the total number of simulation steps .",
    "higher values of @xmath23 are beneficial as they allow the system to oscillate more frequently within the area of the current basin or jump over a few barriers and thus increases chances to find low - energy escape trajectories .",
    "higher values of @xmath23 also lead to a slightly lower number of minima @xmath39 visited before the ground state is found .",
    "these observations confirm the validity of the bell - evans - polanyi principle in coulomb systems . on the other hand , large values of @xmath23",
    "also increase the total computing time which strongly depends on the length of molecular dynamics trajectories .",

    "our aim is a comprehensive study of a broad range of sizes , and most importantly , classification of the determined structures some of which were previously not seen in two - dimensional systems .",

    "the defects move into the transition region between the circular outer part and the triangular interior .",
    "six groups of defects , located at the corners of a hexagon can often be distinguished @xcite , and the size and composition of the observed defect structures become insensitive to the addition of a single particle to the cluster .",
