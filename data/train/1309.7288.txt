    "the first explicitly constructed universal petri net ( upn ) @xcite consists of thousands of vertices and works exponentially slow ; for its design , a direct simulation of petri net behavior according to its state equation was applied .",
    "the construction was done within the class of pure inhibitor petri nets .",
    "small universal petri nets with the pairs of places / transitions numbers ( 14,42 ) @xcite and ( 14,29 ) @xcite were constructed using the technique of simulating know small universal turing machines ( utm ) : the net upn(14,42 ) simulates utm(6,4 ) @xcite and the net upn(14,29 ) simulates weakly universal turing machine ( 2,4 ) ",
    "wutm(2,4 ) @xcite .",
    "the construction was done within the class of deterministic inhibitor petri nets .",
    "their time complexity was estimated as exponential .    in the present work ,",
    "these nets are modified : a place left added to represent the left moves of the tm control head in an explicit way ; only inhibitor arcs are used to control transitions which fire in multiple instances ; the control flow is represented in an inverse way with moving zero to provide check via inhibitor arcs .",
    "interpretation of the modified upn as a petri net with multichannel transitions @xcite gives polynomial estimations of time complexity .",
    "thus , constructed upn are efficient models of computations .    in sequel , net polyupn(15,29 )",
    "is constructed on upn(14,29 ) , and it is shown that interpreting its behavior as a deterministic timed inhibitor petri net which transitions firing time is discrete and equal to unit and unlimited number of transitions channels gives polynomial time complexity ; the corresponding class of petri net is named a deterministic arithmetic petri net . in the same way the results could be obtained for other early constructed universal petri nets .",
    "a class of _ deterministic arithmetic petri net _ is employed in the present paper that represents a combination of _ a deterministic inhibitor petri net _ ( dipn )",
    "@xcite and _ a timed petri net with multichannel transitions _ @xcite for the case when the firing time of each transition is equal to unit .",
    "since all the times are equal to unit , it is more convenient to not introduce the time concept at all but to perceive petri net as a synchronous @xcite net when at each step the maximal valid set of firable transitions fires . the validity of the maximal set is defined as not leading to negative markings .",
    "but when using transitions numbers as priorities in deterministic inhibitor petri net , only one transition could fire at a step possibly in a few instances .",
    "the necessity of restricting the net behavior making it deterministic is stipulated by the deterministic character of simulated tm .    _ a deterministic arithmetic petri net _ ( dapn ) is is a bipartite directed multigraph supplied with a dynamic process that has synchronous deterministic behavior .",
    "dapn is denoted as a quadruple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are disjoint sets of vertices called places and transitions respectively , the mapping @xmath3 defines arcs between vertices , their type and multiplicity , and the mapping @xmath4 represents the initial state ( marking ) .",
    "the transition choice order is defined by their enumeration @xmath5 ; places are also supposed been enumerated @xmath6 , and the places marking is represented as a vector @xmath7 with integer index @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a nonnegative integer equal to the number of tokens situated in place @xmath10 .",
    "the mapping @xmath11 defines arcs , their types and multiplicities , where transition input and output arc multiplicities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are natural numbers , a zero value corresponds to the arc absence , a positive value  to the regular arc with indicated multiplicity , and a minus unit  to the inhibitor arc . as it was shown in @xcite , petri nets with the multiple arcs",
    "are easily converted to _ ordinary _ petri nets with regular arcs multiplicity equal to unit . to avoid nested indices we denote @xmath14 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 .    in graphical form , places are drawn as circles and transitions as rectangles .",
    "an inhibitor arc is represented by a small hollow circle at its end , and a small solid circle ( read arc ) represents the abbreviation of a loop .",
    "regular arc s multiplicity greater than unit is inscribed on it and place s marking greater than zero is written inside it .    to estimate firability conditions on each incoming arc of a transition ,",
    "the following auxiliary operation is defined @xmath18 to avoid inconsistency with infinite number of instances , here we prohibit transitions without input regular arcs .",
    "the _ behavior _ ( dynamics ) of a dapn could be described by the corresponding state equation similarly to @xcite .",
    "the present work considers the behavior as result of sequential applying the following _ transition firing rule _ :",
    "net transitions @xmath19 are checked sequentially with integer index @xmath20 ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ; 2 .",
    "the number of instances of transition @xmath23 firable at the current step is equal to + @xmath24 .",
    "3 .   the first transition @xmath19 ( with the minimal value of index @xmath25 ) having @xmath26 fires in @xmath27 instances ; 4 .",
    "when transition @xmath23 fires , it 1 .   extracts @xmath28 tokens from each its input place @xmath29 for regular arcs @xmath30 ; 2 .",
    "puts @xmath31 tokens into each its output place @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; 5 .",
    "the net halts if firable transitions are absent .    when a transition , having a single regular incoming arc with multiplicity @xmath34 from place @xmath35 and a single regular outgoing arc with multiplicity @xmath36 to place @xmath37 , fires , it implements the following computations @xmath38 .",
    "that is why it is named arithmetic petri net : it implements division by @xmath34 and multiplication by @xmath36 .",
    "choosing either @xmath34 or @xmath36 equal to unit we obtain either pure multiplication or pure division .",
    "thus , transitions could be thought of as virtual actions .",
    "the number of really started actions depends on the amount of available resources represented by transitions input places .",
    "why we should restrict the number of transitions instances to unit and fire them in sequence , as in classical petri net , when available resources allow firing them simultaneously ? anyway , classical sequential order of transitions firing could be obtained as a special case attaching a place to each transition connected with read arc and having marking equal to unit .",
    "as in upn(14,29 ) @xcite , the source information for simulation is the transition function of wutm(2,4 ) @xcite and the encoding of its states and tape symbols given by table  [ tab : wutm24 ] . in wutm(2,4 ) , an infinite repetition of definite blank words is written on its tape : @xmath39 to the left and @xmath40 to the right of the working zone . according to the function @xmath41 for the tape words encoding @xcite ,",
