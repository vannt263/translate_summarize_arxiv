    "experimental results indicate @xcite that localized magnetic moments could appear when magnetic impurities are dissolved in a metal , and a minimum in the electrical resistivity is always present in the material at low temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "jun kondo was the first who associated the formation of magnetic moments in the material with the minimum of the resistivity .",
    "he studied the phenomena employing perturbation theory in second order in the born approximation , @xcite and showed that the minimum was generated by the spin - flip scattering of the conduction electrons with the magnetic moment of the impurity ; this phenomena become known as the kondo effect . in",
    "its calculation kondo showed that the resistivity increases with the decrease of temperature according to @xmath3 , which become known as the logarithmic divergence of the kondo effect . in the alloys formed in such a way",
    "it is not possible to control the kondo parameters microscopically , but with the advent of nanotechnology the kondo effect was realized experimentally in quantum dots ( qd ) , with complete control over all the relevant parameters @xcite .",
    "quantum dots are artificial atoms that offer a high degree of parameter control by means of simple gate electrostatics , allowing the nanometric confinement of the electrons .",
    "the coupling between the quantum dot and the electronic reservoirs produces tunneling events that can modify the discrete energy levels of the dot , changing them into complicated many - body wave functions .",
    "when conducting electrons move in an out the nanostructure , a progressive screening of the atomic spin occurs , in complete analogy with the well - known kondo effect in solids containing magnetic impurities .",
    "the kondo effect in quantum dots is then observed as a zero - bias conductance resonance , associated with the entangled state of the electrons in the electronic reservoirs and in the dot .",
    "the experimental realization of the kondo effect in qd s renewed the interest in searching new approximate solutions for the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) and several calculations of the green s functions ( gf ) employing the method of motion equation ( eom ) were reconsidered , meir93,luo99 but such methods suffered several drawbacks due to their failure to satisfy the completeness and the friedel sum rule .",
    "completeness07 another method that was extensively applied to describe the siam is the slave boson mean field theory , @xcite but this method suffered from a spurious second order phase transition .",
    "@xcite another recent approach that describes the siam is the local moment approach , @xcite that satisfies a number of correct limits : weak - coupling fermi liquid , atomic limit , and the kondo regime , but the strong coupling limit is plagued with a symmetry breaking and an unphysical static order value of the local magnetic moment",
    ". very recently appeared an analytical calculation , @xcite that employed diagrammatic expansions with feynman diagrams and obtained the kondo resonance in the electron - hole symmetric limit , but out of this limit the kondo resonance was lost .",
    "another appealing approach is the quantum monte carlo technique , @xcite that is expensive from the computational point of view and is restricted from intermediate to high temperatures .",
    "other expensive computational numerical methods are the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "@xcite the most effective approach which nowadays describes the dynamical properties of the siam is the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , nrg1,nrg2,nrg3 but as the other powerful methods it is expensive from the numerical point of view and presents some limitations ; the nrg describes very well the kondo physics but presents convergence problems in the extreme kondo limit .",
    "@xcite until now it was missing a dynamical theory that describes the transition from the weak coupling limit @xmath4 to the strong coupling limit @xmath5 , where @xmath0 is the coulomb repulsion and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the hybridization and @xmath8 is the density of states of the conduction electrons .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to fill the gap described above : the atomic approach is able to describe quantitatively all the regimes of the siam in the weak , intermediate and strong correlation limits of the model . due to the simplicity of its implementation ( practically all",
    "the method is analytical ) and very low computational cost ( a density of states curve can be obtained in few seconds or less ) , the atomic approach is a good candidate to describe strongly correlated impurity systems that exhibits the kondo effect , like quantum dots @xcite or carbon nanotubes .",
    "thiago2_2006 the atomic approach does not substitute powerful computational methods like nrg , dmft or dmrg , but can be a first choice to describe systems where the kondo physics is relevant .",
    "in an earlier work thiago06 we developed the atomic approach for the strong coupling limit ( @xmath9 ) , and in the present work we present the atomic approach for finite u.    the kondo effect for both the impurity and the lattice are described by the anderson hamiltonian , which considers systems that have two types of electrons : the localized electrons ( @xmath10-electrons ) , that are strongly correlated , and the conduction electrons ( @xmath11-electrons ) , that can be described as free .",
    "the anderson model allows the interchange between the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 electrons through the hybridization interaction , and to study this problem we shall consider the cumulant expansion of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) employing the hybridization as perturbation .",
    "@xcite from the cumulant expansion we obtain formal expressions for the exact one - electron green s functions ( gf ) in terms of effective cumulants , that are as difficult to calculate as the exact gf , and our approximation consists in substituting these effective cumulants by those of the atomic case of the anderson model , that is exactly soluble . in general the anderson model",
    "does not have analytical solutions , but when the energies of all the @xmath12 conduction states have collapsed ( the conduction band has zero width ) and the hybridization is local ( i.e. independent of the wave vector @xmath13 ) , the anderson hamiltonian has an exact solution , and the electronic green s functions can be calculated analytically . in this case",
    "it is only necessary to study a single site , that can hold up to four electrons : two @xmath10-electrons and two @xmath11-electrons . with the @xmath10-electrons we can build four states : one @xmath14 with no electrons , two with one electron with spin up@xmath15 or with spin down@xmath16 and one @xmath17 with the two electrons at the same site . in a similar way we can build up four states @xmath18 with the @xmath11-electrons , and for a given site we have then a vector space of dimension sixteen .",
    "the corresponding anderson hamiltonian is then easily diagonalized , giving sixteen eigenenergies and eigenstates that we shall name the atomic anderson solution ( aas ) , and this minimal anderson system contains already the fundamental excitations that generate the kondo effect . to chose the position of the conduction band of the aas",
