    "<S> in this reply , we respond to the above comment . our computation [ phys .  </S>",
    "<S> rev .  </S>",
    "<S> d 91 ( 2015 ) 074512 ] only took into account pure qcd effects , arising from quark mass differences , so it is not surprising that there are discrepancies in isospin splittings and in the sigma  lambda mixing angle . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that these discrepancies will be smaller in a full calculation incorporating qed effects .    </S>",
    "<S> we agree with gal @xcite that lattice numbers for the mixing angle are not complete until numbers for the isospin splittings are correctly accounted for . in our paper , @xcite the calculation only includes qcd effects , arising from quark mass differences . for a complete result </S>",
    "<S> , a full calculation with qed effects added is also needed .    before addressing the main issue </S>",
    "<S> , we would first like to mention that it is not surprising that our results satisfy the coleman  </S>",
    "<S> glashow @xcite and dalitz  von - hippel ( eq .  ( 3 ) of @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> relations . </S>",
    "<S> our fit function has all the @xmath0 symmetry constraints built in , so it automatically obeys every symmetry relation to the appropriate order . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> violations of the coleman  glashow relation are at @xmath1 , while violations of the dalitz  von - hippel relation are at @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that lattice qcd gives reliable numbers for the part of the isospin splitting due to quark mass differences , and that the differences between the values in  @xcite and experiment are mainly due to electromagnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> our reasons to believe that lattice numbers for the purely qcd contribution are accurate are : firstly the lattice gives good values for the splittings between the multiplets ( @xmath3 ) , and it is hard to see how there could be a systematic error that would spoil the isospin splittings without also showing up in splittings between multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> secondly at leading order , pure qcd relates the isospin splittings to the splittings between the multiplets through the relations @xmath4 ( see fig .  2 of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that this leading order formula only has minor corrections from higher order effects , and the above relations hold reasonably well , with a value @xmath5 for the quark mass ratio @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the main systematic uncertainty in this mass ratio are due to the difficulty of correcting for electromagnetic effects in the pseudoscalar meson sector . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ splitting_fig ]    . </S>",
    "<S> black squares are from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ splits ] ) , while blue circles the lattice qcd results . </S>",
    "<S> both use the pure qcd numbers from table 5 , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> red stars use the physical values ( i.e.  for qcd and qed).,width=366 ]    we show the splitting values . the squares and circles are consistent with each other , but do not reproduce the full result without adding a non - qcd force ( namely qed ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the relations  ( [ splits ] ) do not hold in the real world , we take this as evidence that the qed corrections to the isospin splittings are substantial . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with qed included  @xcite show that qed effects on the isospin splittings are comparable with the effects of the @xmath7 difference , and that the combined simulation reproduces the physical numbers very closely </S>",
    "<S> . unfortunately we do not have lattice results for the qed shift in the @xmath8 mass , so we can not estimate the qed effect in the mixing matrix element .    in the paper by isgur @xcite </S>",
    "<S> there are electrostatic ( coulomb ) contributions to the isospin splittings , but they cancel completely for the combination @xmath9 $ ] , which , by the dalitz  von - hippel relation , is proportional to the @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing angle . if this holds , we would expect to see some shifts in the isospin splittings , but no coulomb contribution to the mixing angle . however , this exact cancellation is model - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb contributions in @xcite are calculated for a particular gaussian wavefunction , which has more symmetry than required by qcd . for equal - mass quarks </S>",
    "<S> the isgur spatial wavefunction is completely symmetric under exchange of any quark pair . </S>",
    "<S> since the octet is a mixed symmetry multiplet , we do not expect complete symmetry . in the proton ( @xmath12 ) there is no theorem that says @xmath13    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied our flavour analysis to qed effects too . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are five allowed coefficients for the electromagnetic effects , one of which just shifts all masses by the same amount , so making no contribution to splitting or mixing . in terms of these coefficients , we find ( assuming small mixing angle ) @xmath14 e^2 \\nonumber\\\\   </S>",

    "<S> ( [ emmix ] ) . however , these inter - relations are model dependent , and we need lattice calculations to see how well they hold .    </S>",
    "<S> we are currently working on a combined simulation with qed effects included . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results suggest that qed effects do account for much of the difference between the current qcd - only results and the experimental values . in the isgur model </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that although the individual splittings will be changed by qed effects , the qed contribution to the @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing angle will cancel . </S>",
    "<S> this is however a model dependent statement , with other choices for the spatial wavefunction the cancellation would not be complete . </S>",
    "<S> our joint qed and qcd results are not yet at the point where we can comment on how much the mixing angle is changed by qed , but we are grateful to gal for bringing the issue to our attention , and will certainly include a discussion of the question when we have our final results . </S>"
