    "observations of the @xmath0  mm continuum emission in orion bn / kl were made using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",

    "we then self - calibrated the narrow - band @xmath37 sio maser data , applied the derived phase and amplitude corrections to the broadband continuum data , and produced a high - quality map of the continuum emission .",
    "a detailed description of this calibration procedure can be found in @xcite .    using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) task imagr , we made images of the bn / kl region with 4096@xmath194096 pixels and cell size 0@xmath33005 to cover a 20@xmath38 field .",
    "we produced maps with two different weightings of the ( u , v ) data , first setting the imagr `` robust '' weighting parameter to @xmath39 ( equivalent to natural weighting ) and then to @xmath40=0 .",
    "we restored these image with a circular beams with fwhm 59  mas and 47  mas , respectively .",
    "the sizes of these restoring beams are approximately the average of the geometric - mean sizes among different epochs ( see table  [ obs ] ) . since the synthesized beam size in the ac952 program was larger ( @xmath3520% ) than that in other programs , this choice resulted in a degradation of the resolution for other epochs .",
    "for this reason , we also produced images with round restoring beams of 40  mas ( @xmath41 weighting ) and 50  mas ( @xmath42 weighting ) , equal to the geometric - mean size of the beams in projects ac817 and ag622 , thus slightly `` super - resolving '' ac952 .",
    "the  high - resolution \" maps were used to analyze structural changes in the continuum emission from source  i ( sect .  [ srci ] ) , whilst the  low - resolution \" images were used to fit positions and track proper motions of the continuum sources in bn / kl ( sect .",

    "four continuum sources were detected above a @xmath43 lower limit of @xmath44  mjy  beam@xmath17 in the most sensitive epoch ( 2009 january 12 ) : bn , i , _ n _ , h @xcite .",
    "for each detected source , a two - dimensional ellipsoidal gaussian model was fitted in a @xmath45 pixel area around the peak emission , using the aips task jmfit .",
    "for source  i , we used the aips task omfit to directly fit the visibilities using a disk model geometry , which is more appropriate for the elongated morphology of the emission than the gaussian model fitted by jmfit ( see below ) .",
    "the positions , flux densities , and deconvolved angular sizes of the detected sources for the 2009 january 12 epoch are given in table  [ sources ] .",
    "the flux densities obtained for bn and source  i are in good agreement with the values previously reported in the literature @xcite . source  _ n _ was recently detected with the vla for the first time at 7  mm by @xcite , who reports a flux density of @xmath46  mjy .",
    "this a factor @xmath352 higher than what we found in 2009 january 12 .",
    "the discrepancy might be due either to a different filtering of the total flux in the two observations ( 0@xmath3305 vs 0@xmath332 beam ) or to intrinsic variability of source  _ n _ , possibly due to non - thermal nature of the continuum emission @xcite . based on a comparison between 7  mm and 3.6  cm observations",
    ", however , @xcite estimated a spectral index of 0.2 for the continuum emission from source  _ n _ , suggestive of marginally thick free - free thermal emission , as expected in an ionized outflow .",
    "since the 3.6  cm emission is extended over 0@xmath336 ( i.e. , an order of magnitude more than the restoring beam in a - configuration ) , the variation in flux between measurements with different angular resolutions is most probably due to filtering of the total flux in the most extended configuration .",

    "in addition , we found no evidence for significant variations in the total 7  mm continuum flux density of source  i over the last decade , with all values being consistent with @xmath59  mjy .",
    "what is the nature of this ionized emission ?",
    "the centimeter - to - millimeter wavelength spectrum of the entire source can be characterized as a power law with flux density @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the emission is optically thick up to 100  ghz , with a dust component dominating above 300 ghz @xcite .",
    "the radio emission has been interpreted either as an ionized jet with a nw - se axis @xcite or as an ionized disk with a ne - sw axis @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will discuss three alternative interpretations of the radio continuum emission from source i : 1 ) an ionized jet , 2 ) an equatorial wind , and 3 ) an accreting disk .",
    "we will show that only the latter is consistent with our multi - epoch data .",
    "if the emission originates in an ionized jet , one would expect to detect structural variations owing to motions of individual jet components .",
    "in fact , when observed with high - angular resolution , radio jets do not show a smooth structure , but contain clumps . using multi - epoch vla observations , detection of proper motions as large as @xmath35100 - 500  km",
    "s@xmath1have been reported in the components of radio continuum jets associated with both low - mass ysos ( e.g. , hh1 - 2 -@xcite ) and high - mass ysos ( e.g. , cepheus - a - @xcite ; hh80 - 81 - @xcite ) .",
    "assuming 20  km  s@xmath1as a lower limit for the expansion velocity of the jet associated with source  i ( as estimated from the sio maser flow by @xcite ) , displacements of @xmath3540  au are expected on a temporal baseline of 9 years .",
    "such displacements are comparable to the radius of the continuum emission and are easily detectable with the linear resolution of our observations ( @xmath3525  au ) . in principle , no structural changes would be expected from an optically thin , homogeneous ionized region . however , even in the case of uniform density , thermal pressure would drive expansion of the ionized region as a whole , as seen for ionized winds and hii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as well , classic models of spherical winds @xcite and ionized jets @xcite predict the size of the ionized region to vary as a function of frequency as @xmath61 , which would imply a factor of 3 change in size between 8.4  ghz and 43  ghz .",
    "nonetheless , deconvolved sizes obtained for the radio continuum emission around source  i are similar at the two frequencies : 0@xmath3323 @xmath19 0@xmath33115 at 43  ghz ( this work ) and 0@xmath3319 @xmath620@xmath3315 at 8.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the radio emission from source i arises in a disk - like structure rather than in a jet , where the gas is not accreting but rather consists of an equatorial ionized wind .",
    "such an equatorial wind has been modeled by @xcite .",
    "the model predicts that the radiation pressure ( mediated by line opacity ) from a massive yso accelerates material from the surface of the disk and blows it away mainly in the equatorial plane .",
    "the velocities obtained for the gas are of the order of a few hundreds km  s@xmath1 .",
    "also in this scenario , large changes in morphology are expected over short time intervals ( i.e. , a few years ) owing to fast motions of clumps in the wind , as observed in the luminous yso s140 irs1 @xcite .",
    "in addition to fast motions , rapid changes in the wind structure are expected as well , owing to small changes in illumination by the ionizing yso and to the inherently unstable nature of the radiation - driven winds ( owocki et al .",
    "hence , we conclude that our multi - epoch data are not consistent with the picture of a radiation - driven disk - wind model .",
    "finally , we consider the case that the elongated structure traces ionized accreting gas in a disk .",
    "@xcite has shown that , even when the inner portion of a disk is fully ionized , accretion of ( ionized and neutral ) material can continue onto a massive yso . in this spherically symmetric model , the gravitational attraction of the star exceeds the outward force of the ( radiation and thermal ) pressure inside a critical radius @xmath63 , where g is the gravitational constant ,",
    "m is the mass of the yso , and @xmath64 is the sound speed in the ionized material . in the hypothesis of spherical accretion , by scaling the stellar parameters in table  1 from @xcite to a 10  m@xmath3  star",
    ", ionized accretion can proceed inside of the critical radius @xmath3525  au with an accretion rate @xmath65  m@xmath3  yr@xmath17 .",
    "this critical radius is reasonably consistent with the disk size observed at 43  ghz in source i. in sect .",
    "[ dyn ] , we report evidence for source  i being a binary of total mass of the order of 20  m@xmath3 . in the most probable case of an equal - mass binary , this would slightly increase the critical radius above , estimated in the assumption of one 10  m@xmath3  single star .",
    "we note that similar values for the critical radius and accretion rates are obtained for models of ionized accretion in the presence of significant angular momentum @xcite , as required by the disk geometry in source  i. we also note that an accretion rate of @xmath66  m@xmath3  yr@xmath17and a central stellar mass of 10 to 20  m@xmath3  is consistent with a luminosity of a few times @xmath67  l@xmath3 for source  i. the interpretation of the ionized elongated structure as a disk versus a jet is relevant to a key longstanding question regarding orion bn / kl : what are the drivers of the region s outflows ? in our interpretation , the elongated radio continuum structure traces a nearly edge - on disk , with a spin axis aligned ne - sw , parallel to the low - velocity outflow ( see   [ int ] ) .",

    "<S> we present new @xmath0  mm continuum observations of orion bn / kl with the very large array ( vla ) . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve the emission from the young stellar objects ( yso ) radio source  i and bn at several epochs . </S>",
    "<S> radio source  i is highly elongated northwest - southeast , and remarkably stable in flux density , position angle , and overall morphology over nearly a decade . </S>",
    "<S> this favors the extended emission component arising from an ionized edge - on disk rather than an outwardly propagating jet .    </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the proper motions of source  i and bn for the first time at 43  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that both sources are moving at high speed ( 12 and 26  km  s@xmath1 , respectively ) approximately in opposite directions , as previously inferred from measurements at lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss dynamical scenarios that can explain the large motions of both bn and source  i and the presence of disks around both . </S>",
    "<S> our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close ( @xmath2  au ) dynamical interaction occurred around 500  years ago between source  i and bn as proposed by gomez et al . from the dynamics of encounter </S>",
    "<S> we argue that source i today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20  m@xmath3 , and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close encounter . </S>",
    "<S> this enables preservation of the original accretion disk , though truncated to its present radius of @xmath2  au .    </S>",
    "<S> n - body numerical simulations show that the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20  m@xmath3  total mass ( source  i ) and a single star of 10  m@xmath3  mass ( bn ) may lead to the ejection of both and binary hardening . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational energy released in the process would be large enough to power the wide - angle , high - velocity flow traced by h@xmath4 and co emission in the bn / kl nebula . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct , the smaller mass for source  i recently estimated from sio maser dynamics ( @xmath5  m@xmath3 ) by matthews et al . </S>",
    "<S> , suggests that non - gravitational forces ( e.g. magnetic ) must play an important role in the circumstellar gas dynamics . </S>"
