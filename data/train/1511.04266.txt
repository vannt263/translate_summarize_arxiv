    "the chemical composition of circumstellar disks is one of their most important properties as it controls many key phenomena like accretion , angular momentum transport , and ionization .",
    "therefore , it directly impacts planet formation in protoplanetary disks .",
    "a basic parameter describing the chemical composition is the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) consists mainly of gas ; only a small fraction ( @xmath0% ) is in the form of dust grains .",
    "protoplanetary disks are thought to have a gas - to - dust ratio close to the ism value during their early evolutionary stages .",
    "therefore , the ism gas - to - dust ratio of 100:1 is often _ assmued _ when deriving the total disk mass from dust thermal emission measurements . directly deriving the total gas reservoir",
    "is more challenging as the conversion of gas emission line fluxes to total ( gas ) disk mass strongly depends on often uncertain model parameters .",
    "one possibility to trace the gas is x - ray absorption .",
    "the absorption cross section is essentially independent of the chemical bonds of the absorbing material , because x - ray absorption involves the inner shell electrons while molecular bonds involve the outer ( valence ) electrons .",
    "thus , we can derive the absorber s gas content from its x - ray absorption signal .",
    "comparison with optical extinction caused by the dust along the line - of - sight enables us to measure the gas - to - dust ratio of the absorbing material .",
    "the location of the absorber(s ) along the line - of - sight often remains uncertain .",
    "time variability of the absorption can help to overcome this ambiguity . in this proceedings , we present three cases where the absorber location can be determined with some certainty so that a local gas - to - dust ratio can be derived .",
    "au  mic is a young ( @xmath1 myrs , @xcite ) m1 dwarf at a distance of about 10pc belonging to the @xmath2pic moving group ( @xcite ) .",
    "au  mic is surrounded by an edge - on debris disk , i.e. , a dust - rich disk .",
    "this disk , extending out to , has been subject to numerous studies from scattered light ( e.g. @xcite ) , over dust emission ( @xcite ) to absorption ( @xcite ) and molecular hydrogen emission ( @xcite ) . given its small distance to the earth , we can exclude substantial interstellar absorption so that any absorption signal can be safely associated with au  mic s circumstellar disk .",
    "thanks to its youth and distance , au  mic is a bright x - ray source ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained a _",
    "chandra _ letgs x - ray spectrum of au  mic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : au_mic ] , published in @xcite ) , which extends from a up to @xmath3 . this wavelengths coverage allowed us to compare lines of the same element and ionization stage formed at largely different wavelengths .",
    "the line ratios are given mainly by atomic physics and almost independent of the plasma temperature .",
    "thus , these line ratios can be used to measure the total absorption towards au  mic . specifically from our analysis of abundant fe  lines ,",
    "we limit the gas column density to @xmath4@xmath5 ( @xmath6 conf . ) .",
    "furthermore , this spectrum allowed us to directly constrain the amount of carbon in gas and small grains ( @xmath7 m ) from the depth of the carbon k - edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : au_mic ] ( right ) shows a zoom into the wavelengths region around the c - k edge .",
    "the edge - like structure is clearly visible .",
    "however , its depth can be entirely explained by carbon in the detector itself .",
    "we derive an upper limit on the circumstellar carbon content of @xmath8@xmath5 .    comparing our upper limits with published dust masses , we find that the disk must contain more dust than gas .",
    "the measurements of @xcite suggest a dust mass around @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , which would correspond to a total dust column density of @xmath10g@xmath5 or @xmath11@xmath5 for ism abundances . that we detect",
    "less absorption implies that the dust is locked in large grains that are opaque to x - rays .",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=254 ] kev . , title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]    the classical t  tauri star ( ctts ) aa  tau is surrounded by a gaseous protoplanetary disk .",
    "compared to au  mic , aa  tau is younger ( @xmath12myrs ) and its disk is not viewed edge - on , but inclined by 75@xmath13 with respect to the plane of the sky . thus , the disk is not in front of the star for most of the time .",
    "the inner disk region , however , is warped and periodically eclipses the star .",
    "x - ray data showed that this inner region is gas - rich as measured by @xmath14/@xmath15 where @xmath14 is the equivalent hydrogen column density derived from low - resolution x - ray spectra and @xmath15 is the dust extinction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    towards the end of 2011 ,",
    "the system darkened significantly in the optical ( @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : aa_tau ] left ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the extra absorption is caused by disk material at larger radii ( @xmath17au ) , which rotated into view and now obscures the line - of - sight towards the central star . that the inner disk region is obscured from view",
    "is confirmed by our high - resolution hst fuv spectrum obtained during the dim state , as the h@xmath18 line width decreased compared to the bright state s data published by @xcite .",
    "we obtained a new x - ray observation with xmm - newton during the dim state .",
    "it reveals that the increase in absorbing column density is moderate ( ) .",
    "our contemporaneous uv to near - ir data characterize the dust extinction during the dim state . comparing dust and gas absorption , we find a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath19@xmath5 , which is within a factor of two of the ism value ( @xcite ) .",
    "rw  aur consists of two cttss ; both of approximately solar mass .",
    "the system underwent a major dimming event towards the end of 2014 ( @xmath202 - 3mag ) .",
    "this event resembles a previously observed half - year long dimming , which was attributed to a tidal stream between both binary components ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the new dimming might more closely resemble the aa  tau dimming with obscuration by the primary s disk itself as suggested by infrared data ( @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained a new _ chandra _ observation of the system during a dim state that started end of 2014 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rw_aur ] ) . comparing the dim state s x - ray properties with those observed previously by @xcite during the bright state",
    ", we find an increase in absorbing column density of @xmath21@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite find that the optical extinction appears rather gray , i.e. , that the absorption is caused by grains with sizes greater than 1@xmath22 m .",
    "therefore , the dust mass might differ from the value suggested by assuming @xmath23 and an ism - like grain population . as an estimate",
    ", we assume absorption by @xmath24 m sized grains and opacities from @xcite ) . with these assumptions , the gas - to - dust ratio of the extra absorber is below the ism - value when comparing the observed 2mag of dust extinction with the increase in x - ray absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio of circumstellar material is probed by the ratio between x - ray absorption ( @xmath14 ) and optical / nir extinction ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we present three systems where we applied this method .",
    "the debris disk system au  mic contains more grains than gas , the protoplanetary disk around the ctts aa  tau has a gas - to - dust ratio compatible with the ism at radii of a few au , and the absorber in the young binary system rw  aur has low gas - to - dust ratio and large grains ."
