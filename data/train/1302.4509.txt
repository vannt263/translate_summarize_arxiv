    "one of the long - standing puzzles of the hole - doped high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) is the existence of the ubiquitous pseudogap state that precedes the superconducting state.@xcite the pseudogap state , a partial suppression of the spectral density , generally are detected as either a pseudogap temperature ( @xmath5 ) or a pseudogap energy ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the initial reported @xmath5 or @xmath6 differed in details from material to material at , presumably , the same doping level and , sometimes , it is not even consistent with each other in the same material at the same doping level if determined by different experimental probes .",
    "we also showed that , using our proposed universal @xmath7-scale@xcite of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) doped - hole concentration @xmath7 , all measured @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s of hole - doped htcs fell on either of the two , the upper or the lower , pseudogap lines.@xcite furthermore , a unified electronic phase diagram ( uepd ) was constructed in which there are four characteristic temperatures ( energies ) for hole - doped htcs with an optimal superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 of @xmath990 k , such as bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 and hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath10.@xcite     ( color online ) electronic phase diagram of ( a ) @xmath11 and ( b ) @xmath12 in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the colored solid lines are characteristic ( a ) temperatures and ( b ) energies in the unified electronic phase diagram ( uepd ) @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we plot various pseudogap measurements of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 together with schematic sketch of the uepd .",
    "three very distinct features can be clearly summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : ( i ) there are three characteristic temperatures ( energies ) : the lower pseudogap @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the upper pseudogap @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and the hump @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) in the underdoped to the slightly overdoped regimes ; ( ii ) all three characteristic temperatures ( energies ) merge together with superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 ( superconducting gap energy @xmath19 ) , at the slightly overdoped level ; ( iii ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 are connected by 2@xmath20 = 7 @xmath21 1,@xcite where @xmath22 is the boltzmann s constant",
    ". therefore all three energy - scales , which are correlated with corresponding characteristic temperatures measured by vast different experimental probes on various htcs with @xmath8 of @xmath990 k , are unified in the uepd .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) had made a unique contribution to the study of htcs through the direct observation of the inhomogeneous nanoscale electronic gaps ( inseg ) in the superconducting states.@xcite a recent stm / s study pushed this electronically heterogeneous picture well into the pseudogap state by showing that nanoscale local gaps persist at a temperature well above @xmath4.@xcite it was shown that in the optimal to overdoped regimes the local inseg appear ( vanish ) at a temperature @xmath23 upon cooling ( warming ) where @xmath23 and the inseg energy ( @xmath24 ) are universally connected by 2@xmath25 = 7.9 @xmath21 0.5.@xcite in the underdoped regime , the situation is more complicated : two gap - like structures , the pseudogap and the pairing gap,@xcite are observed and , therefore the simple relation , between local - gap vanishing temperature and gap size , namely , 2@xmath25 = 7.9 @xmath21 0.5 could not be clearly pinned down .",
    "temperature dependent stm measurements showed that the cuo@xmath0 plane is gradually covered by the inseg with decreasing temperature.@xcite although the inseg have been subjected to intense studies in the past decade , the origin and the physical significance of inseg to the ubiquitous pseudogap state and the high-@xmath4 superconductivity is largely unexplored .    in this report we analyzed the stm data of the purely oxygen - doped bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 by using the @xmath7-scale and compared the results with our proposed uepd with @xmath8 of @xmath990 k.@xcite we show that in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 the specific coverages , 50% and 100% , of the cuo@xmath0 plane by inseg are quantitatively connected to the upper and lower pseudogaps of the uepd .",
    "we further show that the previous conclusion based on nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies that yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 is electronically homogeneous is not correct under @xmath7-scale .",
    "the electronic inhomogeneity is generic in the hole - doped htcs .",
    "we conjecture that the origin of pseudogaps is the geometrical coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by the inseg state .",
    "in analyzing stm data of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , we selected the single crystal data with either thermoelectric power at 290 k ( @xmath26 ) or @xmath4 reported in the publications .",

    "these experimental observations of very subtle changes of physical properties by different probes in different materials that universally fall on either the upper or the lower pseudogap reconfirm the two - pseudogap scenario reported in ref .  .",
    "this further validates the uepd reported in ref .  .",
    "the novel connection between pseudogaps and nanogap distribution is a natural consequence of plotting the published experimental results by using the quantitatively correct and accurate @xmath7-scale .",
    "based on this inhomogeneous nanogap distribution picture and its quantitative connection to the bulk pseudogap , it is interesting to point out that these `` phase transitions '' are highly unusual that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) appeared right at a 50% coverage and ( 3 ) occurred when 100% of the cuo@xmath0 planes are covered by the nanogaps .",
    "how does a phase transition emerge from such an inhomogeneous background at the specific nanogap coverage require further studies .    to understand why various probes can detect the pseudogap of either the 50% or 100% coverage of cuo@xmath0 planes by inseg",
    ", we point out that the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath5 , 2@xmath80 = 7 @xmath21 1 , revealed in the uepd plot , and that between @xmath24 and @xmath23 , 2@xmath81 = 7.9 @xmath21 0.5 reported in ref .  ,",
    "are surprisingly similar , within the error band of the original construction of the uepd .",
    "the uepd was constructed by the data collected from many experimental techniques which probe an area with a length - scale that is much larger than the characteristic length - scale , @xmath9 10@xmath82 , of inseg .",
    "this strongly suggests that the pseudogaps revealed in uepd are the expectation value of the gap map sampled in the characteristic length - scale of the experimental probe .",
    "indeed , it is intriguing to see that the gap map identified in the stm / s can be naturally related to the `` bulk '' pseudogap measured by various bulk probes : @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) are the gap energies ( temperatures ) when one half or the entire cuo@xmath0 plane is covered by the inseg , respectively .",
    "the former is detected by the deviation from the high - temperature trend that was measured by in - plane dc resistivity,@xcite and nernst effect,@xcite and the latter are properties that are detected by various bulk and surface - sensitive probes.@xcite it is interesting to note that the 50% coverage corresponds to 2d percolation limit of a square lattice.@xcite therefore , we conclude that the upper and lower pseudogaps detected by different experimental probes must also be related to , besides the characteristic length - scale , the energy - scale of the experimental probes . in this context , the pseudogaps in the uepd are the spatially `` averaged '' response of the gap map measured by the individual experimental probe . depending on the characteristic energy - scale and length - scale of the experimental probes :",
    "some of the probes are sensitive enough to pick up the incipient inhomogeneous nanoscale electronic state , some probes pick up the percolation path and the others measure the true bulk property when the cuo@xmath0 plane is completely covered by inseg .",
    "there are two mutually exclusive scenarios regarding the connection between inseg coverage and the pseudogaps : one is that the connection between 50% ( 100% ) coverage to the upper ( lower ) pseudogap is only a surface manifestation of a intrinsically bulk pseudogap , therefore , the nanoscale inhomogeneity is just a surface state that is distinct from bulk .",
    "the other is that it is an intrinsic property of the cuo@xmath0 plane that the inseg is not confined to the surface but also exists throughout the bulk .",
    "we are not aware of any bulk transition that induces the surface coverage properties as we have observed here .",
    "it is very difficult to envision that the connection between the specific coverage of cuo@xmath0 planes and the two pseudogaps over such wide doping range is only a surface property .",
    "in fact , similar characteristics and similar nanoscale inhomogeneity were observed in very different htcs @xcite that we expect , if the gap map data sets are available in the literature , then the gap map would lead to the same coverage as we observed .",
    "furthermore , uepd is constructed from the reported @xmath5 and @xmath6 , of many htcs with @xmath72 90 k , measured by various surface - sensitive probes and bulk probes that can not be just coming from a surface state . in light of the aforementioned observations and the further connection between the 100% and 50% coverage of cuo@xmath0 planes by inseg to the lower and the upper pseudogaps ,",
    "respectively , we argue that the specific coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by inseg should be intrinsic , at least , to bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 and , more likely , to be generic to htcs with @xmath72 90 k. this conclusion is also consistent to the fact that pseudogap is a pure 2d property as we have shown in ref .  .",

    ". however superconductivity in the underdoped regime , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , appears at an even lower temperature _ * after * _ the cuo@xmath0 plane is _ * completely * _ covered by the inseg .",
    "therefore , combing all the above observations and for the entire doping range , we conclude that 100% coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by the inseg is a _ * necessary * _ condition for generating the high-@xmath4 superconductivity in cuprate superconductors .",
    "we emphasize that our conclusion is fundamentally different from other two - energy - scale scenarios , where the charge order is competing against superconductivity .",
    "in contrast , we proposed that the 100% coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by the inseg is a necessary condition for the high-@xmath4 superconductivity , and the high-@xmath4 superconductivity is `` realized''on a texture of a globally coupled inseg of the lower pseudogap state .    to further elaborate our point we examine the doping dependence of the entropy associated with the lower pseudogap state . for a gaussian distribution the standard deviation ( @xmath83 )",

    "since the @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ) follow the upper and the lower pseudogap energies ( temperatures ) , respectively , we can clearly see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ) also disappear with @xmath4 ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath85 1.3 .",
    "the disappearances of @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath83(@xmath43 ) at @xmath85 1.3 indicate that the gaussian distribution , that is inseg state , is also disappearing with @xmath4 ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath85 1.3 . the concomitant disappearance of @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath29 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath83(@xmath43 ) at the doping level when superconductivity ceases to exist , coupled to the monumental evidences that superconductivity coexists with the pseudogap state,@xcite again suggests that the lower pseudogap state , the state that the cuo@xmath0 plane is completely covered by inseg , is a necessary condition for high-@xmath4 in cuprates .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) , we plot the @xmath83(@xmath84 ) as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "although there are some scattering , @xmath83(@xmath84 ) tends to increase with doping .",
    "the trend in the doping dependence of @xmath83(@xmath84 ) is opposite to that of @xmath83(@xmath43 ) . although we do not know the scaling rule between @xmath83 and @xmath64 , the trend of @xmath83(@xmath84 ) is similar to that of the intrinsic @xmath64 in the normal state observed by nqr .",
    "accordingly , @xmath83(@xmath84 ) may be corresponding to the intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity .",
    "@xmath83(@xmath43 ) was observed at below 60 k , while @xmath83(@xmath84 ) was observed also at above 80 k. however , the @xmath83(@xmath43 ) is comparable to @xmath83(@xmath84 ) , although the extrinsic @xmath64 is about five times larger than the intrinsic @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath83(@xmath43 ) is not due to the extrinsic electronic inhomogeneity .",
    "when the intrinsic electronic inhomogeneities in the superconducting state disappear , the high-@xmath4 also disappears .",
    "the topographic coverage interpretation of the pseudogaps provides a microscopic inhomogeneous electronic picture for the origin of the pseudogap and superconductivity .",
    "based on this picture , the pseudogaps , an observable due to the averaged response of the topographic coverage at 50% or 100% in the gap map detected by a specific experimental probe , loses its conventional meaning of a `` gap '' .",
    "it is in this context that the gap is `` pseudo '' , and accordingly , all properties measured on htcs should be addressed with the characteristic length - scale and energy - scale of the experimental probes , and the underlying inseg state in mind.@xcite indeed , the photon - energy - dependence of the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) spectra were only recently observed,@xcite when laser - based arpes had achieved a unprecedented high - resolution , indicating that the probe energy should be as low as possible in addressing the low energy quasiparticle states .",
    "furthermore , the nmr and nqr analysis show that the inseg state observed in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 is extended to the other htcs .",
    "while our results link the specific inseg coverage of cuo@xmath0 planes to the two pseudogaps , the origin of and how the high-@xmath4 superconductivity emerges from such a robust inseg state remain to be a challenging problem of the mechanism for htcs .",

    "<S> we have found a quantitative connection between the evolution of the inhomogeneous nanoscale electronic gaps ( inseg ) state detected in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 by scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) and the two , the upper and the lower , pseudogaps in high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) . when the doping and the temperature dependent inseg map are analyzed by using our proposed hole - scale , we find that two pseudogaps are quantitatively connected to two specific coverages of the cuo@xmath0 plane by inseg : the 50% and the 100% coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by inseg correspond to the upper and the lower pseudogaps , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this quantitative connection to the two pseudogaps indicates that the origin of the measured pseudogap energies and temperatures are intimately related to the geometrical coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by the inseg state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that inseg and superconductivity coexist in the underdoped to the overdoped regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to common belief we showed that yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 is electronic inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that pseudogap states are microscopically inhomogeneous and 100% coverage of the cuo@xmath0 planes by the inseg is a necessary condition for the high-@xmath4 superconductivity . </S>"
