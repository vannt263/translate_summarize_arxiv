    "more precisely , qudit s pure states are determined by the equation @xmath37 where @xmath38      from the standpoint of quantum information theory it is mostly interesting to consider states composed of several qubits . according to the quantum theory axiom on composite systems  @xcite , the space of states of system , which is obtained by joining two systems @xmath39 and @xmath40 represents a subspace of the tensor product of their individual hilbert spaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43    the definition ( [ eq : comphil ] ) in conjunction with the superposition principle is a source of an existence of correlations in the joint system , which do not have any classical analog .",

    "the entanglement properties of density matrices ( [ rhobipartite ] ) as well as more general multipartite systems admit formulation in terms of invariants of the so - called local groups @xcite . in the next paragraph",
    "the corresponding notions will be introduced .",
    "on the space of density matrices of @xmath4-level system the group su(n ) acts in adjoint manner @xmath64 if a quantum system is obtained by combining @xmath49-subsystems with @xmath65 levels , the non - local properties of the resulting composite system can be put into a correspondence with a certain decomposition of the unitary operations in ( [ eq : untran ] ) .",
    "namely , from all unitary actions we separate the group of so - called _ local unitary transformations _ ( lut ) @xmath66 acting independently on the density matrices of each subsystems @xmath67 two states of composite system connected by the lut transformations ( [ eq : lut ] ) have the same non - local properties .",
    "the latter can be changed only by the rest of the unitary actions @xmath68 generating the class of non - local transformations .    as it was mentioned in the introduction the action of lut is not transitive .",
    "the equivalence of states regarding the action ( [ eq : lut ] ) gives rise to a decomposition of the space of matrices into the equivalence classes ( orbits ) .",
    "the union of these classes , i.e. , the orbit space , is customary to call as the `` entanglement space '' @xmath69      the main motivation for studying of @xmath70 is necessity to work out qualitative criteria and quantitative measures for characterization of non - locality in composite systems  @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned above , a canonical method for description of the orbit space @xmath70 is the theory of classical invariants  @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "starting from the works by linden and popescu  @xcite , series of interesting results , which clarify the mathematical contents of the entanglement phenomenon , has been obtained .",
    "a considerable progress was achieved for pure states . as an example",
    ", we refer here to the construction of hilbert series for a multipartite systems of qubits  @xcite and classification of pure entangled states based on the theory of hyperdeterminants  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the orbit space for systems in mixed states is much more vague .",
    "the generic questions of construction of basis for rings of local invariants for mixed states have been considered in  @xcite . with this aim",
    "the algorithmic methods of computer algebra were used  @xcite ,  @xcite .    according to the theory of invariants  @xcite , the ring of polynomial invariants @xmath71^g$ ] , of linear space @xmath72 over the complex numbers @xmath73 , under the action of a group @xmath74 represents the graded algebra @xmath75^g=\\bigoplus_{k=1}^\\infty a_k,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the space of homogeneous g - invariant polynomials of degree @xmath77 .",
    "the special unitary groups @xmath78 belong to the reductive algebraic groups .",
    "their ring is finitely generated  @xcite , and @xmath71^g$ ] is cohen - macaulay type  @xcite .",
    "however , straightforward application of this construction to the problems of quantum entanglement is complicated by the fact that the space @xmath8 , on which the local group ( [ eq : lut ] ) acts is not a linear space . as it was already emphasized in the introduction ,",
    "density matrices are the positive semi - definite and therefore the space of representations @xmath8 is nonlinear semi - definite algebraic manifold .",
    "bellow we suggest the trick how to overcome this difficulty , exemplifying the problem in details for a system of pair of qubits .",
    "let start with the construction of the ring @xmath79^{\\mathrm{su(2)\\otimes su(2)}}$ ] of the adjoint action invariants on the space of @xmath80 hermitian matrices @xmath81 .",
    "in order to define the ring @xmath3^{\\mathrm{su(2)\\otimes su(2)}}$ ] , note that the space of positive - definite matrices @xmath82 is subspace of @xmath83 which is invariant under the action of @xmath84 as we demonstrate below the subset @xmath82 admits representation via the set of polynomial inequalities similar to the given here , in @xcite . ] @xmath85 in three invariants , @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the enveloping algebra of @xmath88 group . from the other side , since @xmath89 are at the same time invariants of @xmath90 , then it is possible to construct in @xmath79^{\\mathrm{su(2)\\otimes su(2)}}$ ] such a basis that includes these invariants . as result ,",
    "having this basis and taking into account the inequalities ( [ eq : inset ] ) , we will be able to characterize the ring @xmath3^{\\mathrm{su(2)\\otimes su(2)}}$ ] completely . according to the consideration given in the subsequent paragraphs a basis of the ring can be chosen in a way that only the primary invariants of degree 2 , 3 and one secondary invariant of degree 4 presented in the ring s hironaka decomposition @xcite are constrained by the above polynomial inequalities ( [ eq : inset ] ) .",
    "to succeed in our program of construction of an optimal homogeneous basis for the ring @xmath3^{\\mathrm{su(2)\\otimes su(2)}}$ ] let us start with the discussion of positive semi - definiteness of density matrices .",
    "below the requirement of non - negativity will be formulated in the form of inequalities in invariants of the adjoint action of @xmath78 group on @xmath91      a hermitian operator is positive semi - definite if and only if all its characteristic numbers are non - negative .",
    "the condition of non - negativity of hermitian operator can be formulated solely in terms of coefficients of its characteristic equation : @xmath92 the coefficients @xmath93 in ( [ eq : chareq ] ) are given as the sums of principal minors of @xmath77-th order : @xmath94    since the matrix @xmath44 is hermitian all its characteristic numbers @xmath95 are real roots of the characteristic equations ( [ eq : chareq ] ) .",
    "when @xmath95 are positive then all @xmath93 being the symmetric polynomials @xmath96 are non - negative real numbers .",
    "the inverse statement is true as well ; the non - negativity of the coefficients @xmath93 provides the non - negativity of roots @xmath97 the descartes theorem  @xcite : a number of positive roots ( taking into account their multiplicity ) equals to the number of signs changes in the sequence of the coefficients of the polynomial equation , gives proof of this observation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "so , non - negativity of density matrices can be written in the invariant way as condition of non - negativity of the coefficients of its characteristic equation : @xmath98    we give here , for further use , the explicit form of a few first coefficients @xmath99 written in terms of @xmath4-dimensional bloch vector @xmath100 @xcite : @xmath101    besides from the restrictions ( [ eq : nonnegatcoef ] ) there are upper bounds on @xmath93 due to the normalization condition @xmath102 @xmath103 for @xmath104 note , that the equality fulfils for pure states and the maximal values of @xmath93 are achieved for the equal eigenvalues @xmath105 of density matrices .",
    "finally , the positive semi - definiteness and normalizability conditions for density matrices of @xmath4-level system can be written as the following set of inequalities @xmath106    coefficients @xmath107 of the characteristic equation are invariants under the adjoint action of @xmath108 group .",
    "they are algebraically independent and can be represented via polynomials in the casimir operators of the corresponding enveloping algebra .",
    "below , the case @xmath109 related to the system of 2-qubits , is considered in details and inequalities ( [ eq : ineqsyst ] ) are rewritten directly in terms of the casimir operators of the enveloping @xmath110 algebra .",
    "the group su(4 ) has three casimir operators whose expressions in terms of the components of 15-dimensional bloch vector @xmath100 ( see the decomposition ( [ eq : qdit ] ) ) can be written as @xmath111 because for an arbitrary 4-level system the coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 of characteristic equation of density matrix are expressible via these casimir operators @xmath114 the set ( [ eq : ineqsyst ] ) reduces to the following constraints on @xmath88 invariants @xmath115    in the space spanned by invariants @xmath116 and @xmath117 inequalities ( [ eq : ineqsyst4 ] ) define the bounded domain depicted on the figure [ fig ] .     and @xmath118 , width=302 ]",

    "apart from this we linearize the adjoint action ( [ eq : untran ] ) of the local group @xmath131 @xmath132 with @xmath133 matrix @xmath134 .",
    "so , our preliminary issue is to build up the ring of polynomial invariants of linear action of @xmath135 group on the linear space @xmath136 .",
    "note that the linearization ( [ eq : linlut ] ) allows to use the prompt from the molien formula for the generating function of invariants for @xmath137 representations of a compact group @xmath138  @xcite : @xmath139 where the integral is taken over the group @xmath138 with the haar measure @xmath140    the molien function provides information on the polynomial invariants ring s structure .",

    "more detailed information on invariants dependence on coefficients of the decomposition ( [ eq : rho2qb ] ) can be extracted using the so - called method of many - parametric generating functions @xcite . in our case",
    "the many - parametric generating function depends not only on one parameter @xmath141 , but is a function of three arguments , @xmath153 .",
    "the contribution from variables @xmath128 and @xmath154 into the molien function now is taken with the weights determined by each independent parameter , @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively .    it is worth to note that the generating function @xmath153 was found already in the middle of 70-th of the last century @xcite , in connection with so - called problem of _ `` missing index '' _ which arose within issue of nuclei spectrum classification",
