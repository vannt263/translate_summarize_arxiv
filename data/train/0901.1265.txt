    "<S> ( [ 36 ] ) and @xmath83 we have @xmath84 this way , via rge , the scale of noncommutativity @xmath85 becomes the running scale of noncommutativity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however it receives very small change when energy @xmath77 increases . </S>",
    "<S> + _ the 4@xmath86 divergences for nc chiral fermions in u(1 ) and su(2 ) cases _    the one - loop effective action is computed from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 16 ] ) by using background field method .    </S>",
    "<S> our computations shows that divergent contributions from relevant terms are finite due to the structure of the momentum integrals in both , the u(1 ) and the su(2 ) , cases . for nc chiral electrodynamics , with majorana spinors and with the usual definition for the supertrace @xmath87 , @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have used chiral fermions in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> choosing majorana spinors we apparently break the su(2 ) symmetry , and consequently we have to work in the framework of the components for the vector potential . </S>",
    "<S> now of course , majorana @xmath88 is not a su(2 ) doublet . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , we conclude that direct computations by using bfm confirms results of the symmetry analysis for the 4@xmath86 divergent terms , which , due to their u(1 ) invariance , have to be zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same symmetry arguments holds also su(2 ) terms , i.e. they both vanish identically too . </S>",
    "<S> + _ limits on the noncommutativity scale _    from the gauge - invariant amplitude for @xmath89 decays in momentum space and for @xmath90 boson at rest and for @xmath64 , we have found the following branching ratios @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the @xmath90 boson lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> lhc experimental possibilities for @xmath93 we analyze by using the cms physics technical design report @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that for @xmath94 events of @xmath95 for @xmath96 in 2 years of lhc running and by assuming @xmath97 and using @xmath98 about @xmath99 events of @xmath100 decays should be found . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that background sources ( cms note 2006/112 , fig.3 ) could potentially be a big problem . </S>",
    "<S> for example study for @xmath101 shows that , when @xmath102 from @xmath95 radiates very high energy bremsstrahlung photon into pixel detector , for similar energies of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , there is a huge probability of misidentification of @xmath102 with @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the irreducible di - photon background may also kill the signal . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath104 decay was discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , note that after 10 years of lhc running integrated luminosity would reach @xmath105 . in that case and from bona fide reasonable assumption @xmath97 one would find  @xmath106 events of @xmath100 decays , or one would have @xmath99 events with @xmath107 . from above </S>",
    "<S> it follows that , in the later case , the lower bound on the scale of noncommutativity would be @xmath108 . + limits on the scale of noncommutativity in high energy particle physics are coming from the analysis of decay and scattering experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> considering sm forbidden decays , recently we have found the following lower limit @xmath109 tev @xcite from @xmath100 decay . </S>",
    "<S> note here that earlier limits obtained from @xmath110 decay ( astrophysics analysis ) produces @xmath111 gev @xcite while from the sm forbidden @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xcite decays we obtain @xmath114 gev , and @xmath115 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> last two bounds are not usefull due to the too high lower limit of the relevant branching ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> scattering experiments @xcite support the above obtained limits . from annihilation @xmath116 </S>",
    "<S> it was found @xmath117 gev , which is a bit to low . </S>",
    "<S> however , from @xmath118 unelastic scattering experiments there is very interesting limit @xmath109 tev . </S>",
    "<S> + _ summary and conclusion _    principle of renormalizability implemented on our @xmath0-expanded ncgft led us to well defined deformation via introduction of higher order noncommutative action class for the gauge sectors of the mncsm , nmncsm and nc su(n ) models . </S>",
    "<S> this extension was parametrized by generically free parameter @xmath37 : @xmath119 we have found the following properties of the above models with respect to renormalization procedure : + - renormalization principle is fixing the freedom parameter @xmath37 for our @xmath120-expanded nc gft . </S>",
    "<S> + - divergences cancel differently than in commutative gft and this depends on the representations </S>",
    "<S> . + - gauge sector of the nmncsm , which produces sm forbidden @xmath121 decay , is renormalizable and _ finite _ for @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> due to this finiteness no renormalization of @xmath71 necessary . + - noncommutative su(n ) gauge theory is renormalizable for @xmath123 and @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath123 corresponds to the earlier obtained result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case @xmath122 additional divergences appears and had to be absorbed through the renormalization of the noncommutative deformation @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the case of noncommutative su(n ) the noncommutativity deformation parameter @xmath73 had to be renormalized and it is _ asymptotically free _ </S>",
    "<S> , opposite to the previous expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the same is valid for mncsm . </S>",
    "<S> + - the solution @xmath122 , while shifting the model to the higher order , i.e. while extending ` nc minimal coupling ' , hints into the discovery of the key role of the higher noncommutative gauge interaction in one - loop renormalizability of classes of ncgft at the first order in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> + - our computations also confirms symmetry arguments that for noncommutative chiral electrodynamics , that is the u(1 ) case with majorana spinors , the @xmath124 divergent part vanishes . for noncommutative chiral fermions in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) with majorana spinors </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath124 divergent part vanishes due to the su(2 ) invariance . </S>",
    "<S> so , for noncommutative u(1 ) and su(2 ) chiral fermion models typical @xmath124-divergence is _ absent _ , contrary to the earlier results obtained for dirac fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + - there is similarity to noncommutative @xmath125 theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + - note that the renormalizability principle could help to minimize or even cancel most of the ambiguities of the higher order seiberg - witten maps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + - finally , phenomenological results , as the standard model forbidden @xmath121 decay , are _ robust _ due to the one - loop renormalizability and _ finiteness _ of the nmncsm gauge sector @xcite . </S>"
