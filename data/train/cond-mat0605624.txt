    "while superconductivity ( sc ) on the nano - scale has been a long - standing issue , dating back to the seminal work of anderson @xcite , only in the last decade has technological advancement enabled the realization of such systems in experiment @xcite .",
    "since then , manifestations of sc on the nano - meter scale has been observed not only in isolated grains @xcite or granule on insulating substrate @xcite , but also in inhomogeneous sc thin films , where well - separated sc and normal regions have been observed @xcite . in such hybrid systems ,",
    "the proximity between the sc and normal phases gives rise to novel effects , mainly manifested in the local density of states ( ldos ) , which may be directly measured using scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "encouraged by the technological advance , we ask the following question : what would be the properties of an ultra - small sc grain placed on a _ metallic _ ( or a doped semi - conducting ) substrate ? in such a case , would the gap in the grain still obey anderson s criteria @xcite , or will the proximity effect yield a new criteria for the destruction of sc in such a grain , as seen in , e.g. thin sc layers attached to normal layer @xcite ? furthermore , in such systems one expects that the sc properties of the grain would be strongly affected by the properties of the surrounding metal , and that the proximity to a sc grain would generate pair correlations that would impinge on the local properties of the metallic area , such as its ldos @xcite .",
    "the above question is also interesting form a technological point of view , as josephson arrays fabricated on metallic or semi - conducting substrate seem to have large technological potential as nano - electrical devices .    in order to examine these issues , a minimal model of a single sc grain placed in a clean metal matrix",
    "is studied , by means of a negative - u hubbard hamiltonian in which the interactions are confined to a small region in space ( so - called `` negative - u impurity '' ) . applying a hartree - fock - gorkov mean - field decomposition @xcite leads to the bogoliubov - de - gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian @xcite , which serves as a starting point in the calculation .",
    "the effect of the proximity between the sc grain and normal area is investigated by numerically solving a tight - binding bdg hamiltonian in one and two dimensions .",
    "it is found that the pairing in the grain is strongly affected by the chemical potential ( i.e. density ) of the substrate , and that on the normal area pair - correlations may either be suppressed exponentially away from the impurity or be long - ranged , depending on the value of the attractive interaction in the grain .",
    "the dependence of the gap in the grain on its size is studied using a continuous version of the bdg hamiltonian .",
    "solved analytically , the dependence of the gap on island size is found to diminish as a power - law rather than exponential ( as in an isolated grain @xcite ) , and the minimal island size under - which sc vanishes in the grain @xcite is evaluated , and is found to depend on the properties of the substrate .",

    "we have neglected the boundary conditions on the normal - sc interface .",
    "omitting the boundary effect is hard to justify a - priory , especially when the size of the sc grain is smaller than the sc coherence length .",

    "this indicates that neglecting the boundary effect merely results in a quantitative modification .",
    "it does not change the qualitative behavior , which is mainly characterized by the power - law dependence specified in eq ..",
    "one main feature of the result shown in eq .",
    "is that , in contrast to previous works on the proximity effect @xcite , the length - scale is not the usual superconducting coherence length @xmath80 , but rather a new length scale @xmath81 . in order to understand the origin of this new length scale we cast the criterion for the vanishing of sc correlations in the island given by eq .   to the form ( )",
    "^1/2 2 a^2 _d = 1  .[condition ] the factor @xmath82 is nothing but the number of electrons with energy in the range @xmath65 within the island , and thus the condition turns out to be a continuous version of the anderson criteria , which states that sc vanishes in a grain once the number of pairs , roughly given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the level spacing , becomes less then unity .",
    "however , in the above model there is no discreteness of energy levels .",
    "rather , the number of pairs in restricted due to the finite region to which the interaction is limited to . it is also clear from this argument why @xmath80 does not play a role in this system , as @xmath80 indicates the existence of a region where superconductivity is developed to its bulk value , which is not the case here .",
    "yet another way of understanding the result of eq .   is to note that in a sc  semi - conductor junction , one expects that due to the low density on the normal side , the suppression of pair correlations in the sc ( due to the proximity effect ) will no longer be on a length scale @xmath80 as in a sc - metal junction , but rather a new length scale , which in the point - island approximation corresponds to @xmath85 .",
    "thus , if the sc island is smaller than the length - scale on which pair correlations are suppressed , sc in the island will vanish .",
    "one also expects that upon increasing the island size ( beyond the point - island approximation ) this new length - scale will change .",
    "this problem is beyond the scope of the present work and will be addressed in a future study .    in eq .",
    "[ delta ] , @xmath11 has a power - law dependence on the grain size .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of an isolated grain , where an exponential dependence on size is predicted @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the re - normalization of electron number and the dependence of critical island size on the dos , the critical size may be either larger or smaller than given by anderson s criteria .",
    "this may affect the possibility of fabricating devices made from sc grains embedded on a metallic matrix .",
    "this effect may be tested experimentally by , e.g. , varying the dos of the metallic substrate by changing its carrier density ( by gating the sample , for instance ) .",
    "more intuition on the existence of a critical island size or interaction strength may be obtained by noting the similarity between eq .",
    "[ delta ] and anderson s criteria for the existence of a magnetic impurity in a metal @xcite .",
    "this similarity , along with the friedel - like oscillations of eq .",
    "[ dos1 ] , implies that the negative - u impurity is screened by the free electron gas , in an analogous way to the screening of a magnetic impurity .",
    "it would thus be intriguing to investigate the possibility of the formation of an effect equivalent to the charge kondo effect @xcite , resulting from the presence of embedded sc grains .",
    "we conclude by noting that these results may be tested experimentally , by planting superconducting impurities on a metallic substrate and measuring the local gap , in a similar way to that of ref .  .",
    "another system in which our results may be valid is a sc grain strongly coupled to matching leads ( i.e. sc aluminium grain and normal aluminium leads ) , where the existence of sc may be verified as a function of grain size . while this may be experimentally challenging , it may be achieved by , for instance , planting magnetic impurities in the leads .",
    "the dependence of the sc gap on the properties of the substrate , as seen in fig .",
    "[ nmu2 ] for instance , may be tested by changing the density on the metallic substrate .",
