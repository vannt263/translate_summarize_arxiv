    "we study the existence rather than the uniqueness of such a structure .    in the process of building an obstruction theory for the existence of @xmath0-structures on a ring @xmath1 we encountered two assumptions commonly needed on @xmath1-modules .",

    "we discovered that this hypothesis is not needed , if one takes a closer look at the lie algebra structure usually used to solve obstruction issues .",
    "indeed , in our context , the lie algebra structure not only comes from a pre - lie algebra structure but from a pre - lie system as defined by gerstenhaber in @xcite .",
