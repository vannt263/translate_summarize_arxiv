    "experiments in strongly interacting nanostructures are often well described by relatively simple model hamiltonians . in several cases ,",
    "these models are integrable and can be solved exactly , @xcite or they can be studied using powerful numerical methods , such as the numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite these techniques have had enormous success in describing the equilibrium properties of these models . however , the understanding of open systems out of equilibrium remains an extremely challenging area of research .",
    "while recent studies have succeeded in calculating the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of the interacting resonant level model , @xcite the focus of current research has been devoted toward the more difficult single - impurity anderson model incorporating kondo correlations .",
    "for example , experimental results for the finite - bias transport properties of a quantum dot still await a complete theoretical explanation.@xcite besides the fundamental interest in solving this type of problems , kondo physics is an emergent feature in many experiments on nanoscopic systems.@xcite    our goal here is to calculate the i - v characteristics of the single - impurity anderson model , described by the hamiltonian @xmath0:@xcite @xmath1 @xmath2 contains the gate potential @xmath3 and the coulomb repulsion @xmath4 acting on the dot .",
    "the first term in @xmath5 is the hybridization of the dot with the conduction band , and the last term describes the leads .",
    "@xmath6 is the number of sites on the left ( right ) lead , with @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a fermionic creation operator acting on the dot ( @xmath9 ) or a site @xmath10 in the left ( right ) lead ( @xmath11 ) , with a spin index @xmath12 .",
    "the kondo resonance is a signature of the hybridization of the leads with a single electron on the dot.@xcite electrons from the leads screen the extra spin , forming an overall singlet , and the corresponding kondo cloud.@xcite this collective state can be suppressed , and eventually destroyed , by temperature , magnetic field , or a large bias between the leads .",
    "the ultimate goal is to understand the subtle mechanisms behind the suppression of the kondo resonance , and how this response translates into the i - v characteristics of the system .",
    "in particular , when a finite voltage bias is applied , results for the density of states ( dos ) at the particle - hole symmetric point @xmath13 seem to indicate @xcite that the kondo peak smoothly decreases , while the spectral weight is transferred to satellite peaks centered at the chemical potentials of the leads at frequencies @xmath14 . at large biases ,",
    "these peaks merge with broad shoulders at @xmath15.@xcite the possible existence of a negative differential conductance in the high - voltage regime of nanostructures is a topic of intense discussion.@xcite    beyond perturbative limits in @xmath4 or bias voltage @xmath16 , the properties of the steady state , including average currents , are still under scrutiny .",

    "real - time nrg calculates the steady - state density operator and then extracts the current and the nonequilibrium spectral density from that information .",
