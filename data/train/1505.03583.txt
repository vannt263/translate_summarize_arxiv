    "the last five decades have witnessed the great triumph of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "especially the higgs boson was finally discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . however , there are some solid experimental evidences hinting new physics beyond sm .",
    "these evidences include neutrino oscillations  @xcite , dark matter ( dm ) @xcite and baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations can be explained by nonzero but tiny masses of neutrinos . and the observed nearly tri - bimaximal mixing pattern  @xcite strongly indicates new symmetries , discrete or continuous , in the neutrino flavour sector",
    ". in general , models  @xcite inhabited by these new flavour symmetries contain new heavy particles and new cp violation ( cpv ) phases . as a bonus",
    ", these models may provide candidates of the dm , and new cpv sources accounting for bau .",
    "so the flavour symmetry can be a possible solution to the puzzles mentioned above .    in sm , before electroweak symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken , quarks and leptons are all massless . due to the universality of gauge interactions ,",
    "no quantum number can distinguish the three families .",
    "only the yukawa interactions can tell them apart .",
    "thus a simple extension to sm is to introduce a new flavour symmetry among the three families , which is then broken spontaneously . in this work",
    "we take the @xmath7 as the flavour symmetry group , denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "the flavour structure of minimal flavour violation in quark and lepton sectors based on family symmetries have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "models based on other family symmetry , such as @xmath9 symmetry , have been discussed in @xcite .    in",
    "the @xmath8 gauged family symmetry model  @xcite , there are new interactions among the three families .",
    "the extended gauge symmetry group becomes @xmath10 @xmath11 . as the sm higgs field being singlet under this new family symmetry transformation ,",
    "new higgs fields are needed to break the @xmath8 symmetry . a hermitian field @xmath12 which is adjoint representation of the @xmath8 can do this job",
    "actually , to explain the mass and the mixing pattern both in quark and lepton sectors , we need two hermitian fields @xmath13 . in the lepton sector , we also need right handed neutrinos @xmath14 and seesaw mechanism  @xcite to explain the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "so there should be a complex symmetric higgs @xmath15 to generate majorana mass terms for @xmath14 .",
    "the new higgs fields transform under the @xmath8 gauge transformation as @xmath16 for the representation of @xmath7 , one has @xmath17 where the @xmath18 representation denoted as @xmath19 in @xmath20 notation is symmetric while @xmath21 is anti - symmetric . here",
    "the @xmath22 is the symmetric @xmath18 representation of @xmath8 .",
    "seesaw mechanism can also be used to explain the mass hierarchy structures in quark and charged lepton sectors .",
    "there could also be new heavy charged fermion fields as cousins of @xmath14 , and a new @xmath8 singlet higgs @xmath23 to couple these new heavy fields with sm fields together",
    ". we can write down the general particle contents based on @xmath8 gauge family symmetry with features mentioned above , as listed in table.[tab : fermion ] . for the new gauge transformation acting in the same way on",
    "the left handed and right handed parts of all fermions , no chiral anomaly occurs here .",
    ".the particle contents of the model with @xmath8 gauge symmetry and their representation of gauge group @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25(@xmath26 , @xmath27 ) means that the field is singlet of @xmath8(@xmath28 , @xmath29 ) while the @xmath30 means the hypercharge of the field is 0 .",
    "the @xmath31 are the hermitian adjoint representation and the @xmath22 is the symmetric @xmath18 representation of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath22 s vevs produce majorana mass terms for right handed neutrinos .",
    "@xmath14,@xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34 are additional heavy fields that generate mass hierarchy structures in lepton and quark sectors .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it s obvious from table.[tab : res ] that the @xmath35-@xmath36 system and @xmath37-@xmath38 system give the most stringent constraints on @xmath39 .",
    "the lower bounds turn out to be about @xmath40 tev .",
    "@xmath41 can be got through @xmath39 with eq.([eq : v0 ] ) , which turns out to be about @xmath42tev . to apply seesaw mechanism at this scale , we need tuning the yukawa coupling to @xmath43 . although not very nature , it s much better than the situation in sm .",
    "it is notable that the constrains on the scales are not depend on the gauge coupling strength @xmath44 . if we take it on the same order as the weak interaction , the mass of the new lightest gauge family boson can be about @xmath2tev .",
    "this energy scale is at the reach of the next generation @xmath2tev colliders .",
    "in sm fcnc processes occur at loop level through box diagrams and penguin diagrams  @xcite .",
    "these processes are suppressed by high order coupling , loop factor @xmath45 , and ckm factors in power of @xmath46 . with the new gauge bosons",
    ", fcnc process can happen at tree level .",
    "the new gauge bosons may manifest themselves and play a crucial roles in such processes . on the other hand , due to their heavy masses",
    ", there is almost no significant effect on the sm tree level allowed channels .",
    "for example , the rare kaon decay process @xmath47 , and lfnv processes @xmath48 .    in sm ,",
    "the rare kaon decay processes are induced by z - penguin diagram and box diagram . and",
    "the channel @xmath49 violates cp directly  @xcite , providing same flavour contents of the final neutrino pair .",
    "the couplings between sm fermions and the new gauge bosons provide several new @xmath50 low energy effective hamiltonian terms , for the final neutrinos with arbitrary flavour contents , the effective hamiltonian terms are : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and the numerical values of the coefficient matrix elements for @xmath53 , @xmath54 are @xmath55 the diagonal matrix elements correspond to same flavour neutrino final states .",
    "we can sum these channels incoherently and get the coefficient being @xmath56 .",
    "we only focus on the left - handed neutrinos , thus the leptonic current takes a @xmath57-@xmath58 form . as for the hadronic current , since @xmath59 , the final result only depends on @xmath60 .",
    "we have @xmath61 where the neutrino pairs belong to weak eigenstates and have the same flavour . using the isospin symmetry relation : @xmath62",
    "we have @xmath63 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking @xmath64 and using the result @xmath65  @xcite , we can get the branch ratio @xmath66 the sm predicts these semi - leptonic fcnc processes have tiny branch ratios  @xcite @xmath67 we find the contributions from new gauge bosons are far below the sm prediction in eq.([smrare ] ) . the cp violation in @xmath68 is still dominated by sm contribution .",
    "in sm , lfnv processes are caused by the non - zero masses of neutrinos  @xcite and neutrino mixing .",
    "there are several interesting lfnv processes , such as @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in sm , these processes are loop level effects and highly suppressed .",
    "sm predictions of these processes are hopelessly small  @xcite , @xmath71 the experimental bounds on the branch ratios at 90% c.l . are  @xcite @xmath72    the process @xmath73 are not influenced by the new gauge bosons at tree level .",
    "however , for @xmath3 , there are tree level contributions mediated by the new gauge bosons . here with the assumption that @xmath74 , we get the effective hamiltonian for this process is @xmath75 where @xmath76 taking @xmath53 , @xmath54 , we get @xmath77 .",
    "the branching ratio for this channel is @xmath78 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming @xmath79 , we get @xmath80 this result is much larger than the sm prediction in eq.([eq : mu2egamma ] ) but still below the experimental bound  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of new physics in this process is of same order as that in @xmath81 . both of their initial flavours are changed . and",
    "they are induced by the mixing among the heavy family gauge bosons @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "there are many similar processes , such as the rare b decays through @xmath84 , rare kaon decay through @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "their branching ratios are of the same order , i.e. @xmath6 from the new gauge bosons contributions . and they are all below the various experimental bounds .",
    "these results make the lower bound @xmath87 safe .",
    "we have investigated the structure of @xmath8 gauge family symmetry model and its low energy phenomenal results in flavour physics .",
    "this family symmetry undergoes spontaneous breaking to @xmath9 and then to a residual @xmath88 symmetry .",
    "seesaw mechanism is widely used both in leptonic sector and quark sector to explain the observed mass hierarchy and mixing structure , especially the neutrinos mass spectrum .",
    "the equality of seesaw scale and flavour symmetry breaking scale needs a tuning of the yukawa couplings , about @xmath43 , which are much softer than sm .",
    "new scalar field is introduced and may be a dark matter candidate . also new cp violation phases appear and may provide a solution to the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the symmetry breaking mode makes the new gauge bosons can be divided into two groups .",
    "their mass scales can be constrained through the mass differences of @xmath89-@xmath90 meson systems .",
    "we get the broken scale of the new gauge family symmetry is about @xmath91 tev , and mass of the lightest new gauge boson can be low as @xmath2 tev .",
    "these new gauge bosons can induce fcnc processes at tree level , and their contributions are suppressed by their heavy masses and the resulting branching ratios are about @xmath6 , which is @xmath92 order below the current experimental bounds .",
    "we expect the improvement of the rare fcnc processes measurements , as well as some exotic processes discovery , which may be found in the next running of lhc and the next generation colliders of @xmath2 tev , can throw some light upon this new flavour symmetry .",
