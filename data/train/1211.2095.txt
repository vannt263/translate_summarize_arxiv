    "low - mass stars form out of molecular clouds which consist of @xmath8 hydrogen and helium ( further referred to as gas ) , and @xmath9 dust and ices @xcite , i.e. , everything that has a higher complexity than hydrogen molecules or helium .",
    "those molecular clouds have cores between less than @xmath10and more than @xmath11@xcite that are gravitationally unstable .",
    "most parts of the mass will collapse into a newborn star .",
    "the remaining @xmath12 of the total mass will form an accretion disk with pressure supported , sub - keplerian gas @xcite around the young star .",
    "those disks have lifetimes in the order of a few million years @xcite .",
    "dust particles grow due to coagulation @xcite .",
    "however , coagulation models show that there are several barriers to overcome to grow dust large enough to become gravitationally bound in kilometer - sized planetesimals , such as the bouncing barrier @xcite , the fragmentation barrier ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) , and the kilometer - size barrier @xcite .",

    "this paper addresses the fragmentation barrier or meter - size barrier .",
    "pebbles of several decimeters in size will drift very fast inward due to the headwind from the sub - keplerian gas @xcite .",
    "thus , dust has to grow very quickly from some centimeters to several kilometers in size in order to avoid drifting into the inner region of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "turbulence in protoplanetary disks around young stars provides promising mechanisms for rapid planetesimal formation @xcite .",
    "shearing box simulations @xcite are a powerful tool for analyzing the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) as a source of turbulence .",
    "these simulations consider a local , corotating box , representing a small part of a keplerian disk .",
    "@xcite reported long - lived axisymmetric sub- and super - keplerian flows , zonal flows , in shearing box simulations of turbulence caused by the mri .",
    "these zonal flows have been seen in several other local @xcite and global @xcite simulations using a wide variety of codes .",
    "zonal flows are a product of large - scale variations in the magnetic field that transport momentum differentially , creating regions of slightly faster and slightly slower rotating gas .",
    "large - scale pressure bumps are excited through geostrophic balance .",
    "this creates long - lived over - densities that potentially trap dust particles .",
    "a more thorough description of zonal flows and their creation put forward in @xcite found zonal flows always populating the largest radial mode available in the local box approximation . their largest box was simulating @xmath13 pressure scale heights ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "the second component is seen at the largest scales and can be associated with the ( predominantly toroidal ) background magnetic field .",
    "@xcite measure the radial length scale of the zonal flows to converge at @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper we consider even larger physical extents for zonal flow structures .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to measure physical properties such as size and lifetime independent of the simulated domain .",
    "further , we investigate properties of the zonal flows in radially and azimuthally stretched boxes . we alter the radial and azimuthal domain up to @xmath17 gas pressure scale heights .    additionally , we study the behavior of dust in zonal flows .",
    "@xcite was the first to suggest that axisymmetric pressure bumps can trap gas .",
    "@xcite invoked zonal flows as a possibility to explain the submillimeter and millimeter - sized particles observed in protoplanetary disks .",
    "they used artificial static density bumps introduced as sinusoidal density perturbations with different amplitudes ( e.g. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and different wavelengths ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "they found that a @xmath21 density perturbation ( with @xmath22 ) is necessary to stop the drift of the dust grains .",

    "the pressure bumps are generally more pronounced in simulations with a larger radial extent .",
    "simulation set _",
    "a _ strictly follows this general trend .",
    "pressure bump features grow in strength and lifetime with the physical box size , always staying at the largest radial scale .",
    "this rule applies to all but the largest runs  _ xl _ , _ x - xl _ , and _",
    "xxl_. there , instead of the formerly predominant @xmath93 ( @xmath94 in fourier mode @xmath95 ) mode , the mode @xmath96 ( higher modes for run  _ xxl _ ) is occupied by the pressure bumps . in simulation set _ b _ , the strength and size of the pressure bumps converges for simulations with a radial extent larger than @xmath97 .",
    "the lifetime of the pressure bumps even decreases for the largest simulation in this set .",
    "simulation set _ c _ is qualitatively different from the other simulation sets .",
    "strength , size , and lifetime of the pressure bumps seem to be inversely proportional to the azimuthal extent of the box , when the vertical and radial box sizes are kept constant .",
    "this effect was already seen in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both groups show that the magnetic field consists of two components : a local turbulent component that is responsible for the zonal flows and a global azimuthal component .",
    "since the total energy stays approximately constant , the local component gets weaker and consequently zonal flows as well as axisymmetric pressure bumps get weaker too .",
    "figure  [ zonalxxl ] additionally shows space  time plots of the azimuthal gas velocity and the radial gradients of gas density and azimuthal gas velocity of run  _ xxl_. in the right panels , the position of the highest dust density are shown as dots .",
    "particles get clearly slowed by the maxima of the azimuthal gas velocity , i.e. , the large - scale maxima of the pressure gradients .",
    "the velocity has large - scale structures that are very similar to those of the density gradient , as expected in geostrophic balance .",
    "thus , the structure of the velocity gradient can be approximated as the large - scale structure of the second derivative of the gas density .",
    "it is shown in the lower right panel that the particles get stopped at the minima of the radial derivative of the azimuthal gas velocity ( and thus at minima of the second derivative of the gas density ) as analytically predicted ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we calculated the correlation time of the pressure bumps and the zonal flows in the same way as it was calculated in @xcite .",
    "we use the density @xmath98 , averaged over azimuthal and vertical directions , at a given time @xmath99 .",
    "then , we average over each point in radial direction the time it takes for the density at each point to change by a value corresponding to the standard deviation of the gas density .",
    "these measurements are taken for every local orbit .",
    "the measurements are averaged over the time between saturation of the turbulence and a time when the correlation does not extend the correlation time to the final time of the simulation .",
    "finally , the averages are multiplied by two , in order to cover the full temporal extent of the correlated structures .",
    "the correlation times measured in this fashion are in good agreement with the lifetime of the overdensities that is seen in figures  [ zonalall ] and [ zonalxxl ] . however , a change of position of the structures , as seen in run  _ xl _ ( check figure  [ zonalall ] ) , is not accounted for .",
    "thus , correlation times are more likely to be underestimated than overestimated .",
    "also , we can not be entirely sure whether this behavior is really drift or structure decay and reformation",
    ".     grows for boxes with a larger radial extent . only run  _ x - xl _ does not follow this trend .",
    "the large ratio @xmath100 may prohibit formation of stable zonal flows .",
    "the two lower plots show the first four amplitudes of the radial fourier modes of the gas density and the azimuthal gas velocity against their real size @xmath101 ; @xmath102 is the wave number of the corresponding fourier mode , defined by @xmath94 in the fourier mode @xmath103 .",
    "the lines connect the amplitudes of different fourier modes for one simulation .",
    "both quantities have most of their power in the largest modes . only in the largest simulations , the power in the largest modes decreases .",
    "there the maximum is between @xmath104 and @xmath105 . ]",
    "the results of the correlation time determination are shown in table  [ zonalresults ] and in the upper panel of figure  [ correlationtimes ] . for the diagonal simulation set , ( _ a _ ) ,",
    "the correlation time increases with box size .",
    "it seems to saturate toward the largest box size .",
    "the trend to longer correlation times is also evident for simulation set _",
    "b_. here only run  _ x - xl _ has a shorter correlation time than expected .",
    "this might be an effect of the strongly stretched simulation box .",
    "the correlation time decreases slightly with an increasing azimuthal box size in simulation set _ c _ ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ correlationtimes ] shows a measurement for the physical size of the zonal flow features .",
    "we fourier - transformed the vertically and azimuthally averaged gas density and azimuthal gas velocity for each time step and averaged the amplitudes of the first four modes over the time of @xmath106 local orbits .",
    "the length was normalized for the size of the simulation box , to get the physical size of the modes by @xmath107 with the wave number @xmath102 .",
    "the turbulence is always strongest at the largest modes for simulations with @xmath108 .",
    "the highest amplitude for both quantities in the largest simulation domain is found between @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( up to @xmath109 for @xmath110 ) .",
    "these measurements are also found in table  [ zonalresults ] .",
    "the runs  _ l_safi _ and _ xl_safi _ were carried out to compare the turbulence and zonal flow parameters with the runs  _ l _ and _ xl_. they were run to check that zonal flows are no effects from the shear advection scheme that was used in the pencil code . comparing the values in tables  [ turbresults ] and [ zonalresults ] shows that there is little change in the measured properties of the zonal flows and the associated pressure bumps .",
    "however , the computation time increases if one uses the safi scheme .",
    "thus , this scheme was only used to confirm our results .",
    "particle accumulations and planetesimal formation can occur in clumps and filaments of the overdensities in the dust . in our simulations",
    ", we do not include gravitational interaction between the particles .",
    "thus , we only study the passively developed overdensities of the dust to see when and whether overdensities sufficient for the streaming instability can be reached . by not having explicit feedback one can retroactively study the concentration factor for various initial dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "simulations including feedback will have to be done in future studies .",
    "figure  [ surfcoll ] shows the position of every @xmath111 particle in selected simulations .",
    "these plots clearly show the trend for particles to accumulate in the downstream of high - pressure regions .",
    "particles are pulled toward pressure gradient maxima @xcite . in the upper right panel in figure  [ surfcoll ] ,",
    "a snapshot of run  _ xl _ after @xmath112 local orbits is shown . the particles clump up at positions just left of the maxima in the @xmath93 of the gas density ; these are the locations of positive zonal flows , i.e. , regions where the azimuthal gas velocity is higher than the pressure - supported keplerian flow .      in the upper right panel of figure  [ zonalxxl ] ,",
    "the azimuthal gas velocity development of run  _ xxl _ is shown , overplotted with the position of the most massive clump for each time step .",
    "the azimuthal gas velocity coincides with the derivative of the gas density , but it is much easier to interpret .",
    "the speckled structure of the derivatives comes due to the high power in the smaller scales .",
    "however , the large - scale structure is still visible and the geostrophic correlation between the structures of @xmath113 and @xmath114 $ ] is directly observed .",
    "since they have the same large - scale structure , the particle position is much easier interpreted at the azimuthal gas velocity plot than on the density gradient plot .",
    "sometimes the radial displacement from one orbit to the next is too large to be explained by radial drift .",
    "that happens when another clump becomes more massive than the previous one .",
    "these particles accumulate in regions with high azimuthal gas velocities ( see upper right panel in figure  [ zonalxxl ] ) .",
    "the only time when this is not true is at times from @xmath115 to @xmath116 local orbits . in this period ,",

    "the drift velocity of the most massive particle clump is indirectly encrypted in this plot .",

    "<S> recent numerical simulations have shown long - lived axisymmetric sub- and super - keplerian flows in protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> these zonal flows are found in local as well as global simulations of disks unstable to the magnetorotational instability . </S>",
    "<S> this paper covers our study of the strength and lifetime of zonal flows and the resulting long - lived gas over- and underdensities as functions of the azimuthal and radial size of the local shearing box . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate dust particle concentrations without feedback on the gas and without self - gravity . strength and lifetime of zonal flows increases with the radial extent of the simulation box , but decreases with the azimuthal box size . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations support earlier results that zonal flows have a natural radial length scale of @xmath0 to @xmath1 gas pressure scale heights . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first study that combines three - dimensional mhd simulations of zonal flows and dust particles feeling the gas pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure bumps trap particles with @xmath2 very efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath3 particles ( of some centimeters in size if at @xmath4 in an mmsn ) reach a hundred - fold higher density than initially . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the path for particles of @xmath3 and dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath5 or for particles of @xmath6 and dust - to - gas ratio @xmath7 to still reach densities that potentially trigger the streaming instability and thus gravoturbulent formation of planetesimals . </S>"
