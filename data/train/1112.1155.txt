    "it has been long - termly known that , the two different types of charge carrier transport , namely , incoherent hopping and bandlike tunneling , coexist in organic semiconductors , and both of them play an essential role simultaneously.@xcite at the very beginning , when the conducting conjugated polymer was firstly found in 1970s , the explanation for the underlying mechanism of the electric conductivity was based on the picture of solitons and polarons.@xcite it is the strong electron - phonon ( e - p ) coupling in organic materials that makes the electrons or holes self - trap in a lattice distortion .",
    "this charged polaron is the main carrier , which is initially realized to be completely localized in an individual molecule . in this context , it was smoothly concluded that , the character of charge transport between organic molecules should be incoherent hopping of polarons .",
    "however , in the last decade , plenty of experiments reported that there is a region that bandlike tunneling works.@xcite for example , there exists an abnormal region around 100 - 200k that the mobility decreases as temperature increases ( i.e. , negative temperature coefficient of mobility ) .",
    "this indicates the type of carrier transport in this region is bandlike and coherent,@xcite as the charge is found to be delocalized in a region of several molecules ( about 10 molecules from the experiment of electron spin resonance@xcite ) rather than a single molecule .",
    "this result is somehow contradiction to the traditional understanding of localized polarons .",
    "in addition , it was also stated by a recent experiment on the ultrafast initial carrier dynamics that , the intramolecular microscopic dynamics should be significant in the charge transport.@xcite up to now , to describe the _",
    "dualistic _ coherent and incoherent transport is still an open subject .    to understand the new experimental findings , a number of theoretical works based on the microscopic models , such as dynamic disorder model,@xcite su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model,@xcite and anderson model,@xcite were addressed to account for the coherent and incoherent transport,@xcite and the coherent length and diffusion constant@xcite have also been studied .",
    "based on holstein - peierls model , troisi and his coworkers highly commended the mechanism of dynamic disorder.@xcite they proposed that , due to the scattering with phonons , the carrier will be localized into a small region , and thus the mobility decreases . their theory may be applied to the temperature dependence of mobility in organic crystal but has not comprehensively described that in organic semiconductors.@xcite meanwhile , under sufficiently long time evolution , the model seems failing to capture the basic bandlike characteristic.@xcite more importantly , the ehrenfest method used by troisi has some fundamental drawbacks , and the typical one is that the superposition principle is deviated.@xcite this is because the decoherence process has not been appropriately taken into consideration,@xcite while for the simulation of incoherent hopping transport in organic semiconductors , the decoherence process should be of actual importance .    in the common sense ,",
    "the role of phonons is twofold : one is to provide the energy to help the carrier hopping ( hopping transport ) and the other is to scatter with carriers to obstruct them ( bandlike transport ) .",
    "these two mechanisms might coexist in organic semiconductors , which makes the discussion on this issue very complicated . in this work",
    ", we apply the decoherence process into troisi s dynamic disorder model@xcite and then embed it into the monte carlo simulation to quantitatively evaluate the diffusive coefficient within organic molecules .",
    "our aim is to provide a generalized and efficient way to merge the above two roles of phonons into a single framework and find the transition between bandlike and incoherent hopping transport .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section will be the introduction of the present theory .",
    "the main results will be in the third section , and the final section is for the conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the present theory . as the basis , incoherent hopping and thus the decoherence process during intermolecular hopping will be firstly described by introducing a phenomenological parameter , i.e. , decoherence time .",
    "then the details of the calculating procedure of diffusion coefficient will be described .",
    "at last , the dynamic disorder model will be introduced into the theory .",
    "we first discuss the incoherent hopping , which is the motivation we consider the process of decoherence in this work .",
    "originally , in order to study the incoherent hopping , bssler applied the kinetic monte carlo simulation with the so - called miller - abrahams ( m - a ) formula embedded.@xcite based on the gaussian disorder model ( gdm ) , he was able to evaluate the relationship between the mobility of carriers and temperature , electric field , and energy disorder .",
    "especially , he found for the temperature dependence of mobility a scaling @xmath1 , which is quite different from the traditional understanding.@xcite following him , there are lots of work investigating the influence of carrier density,@xcite electron - electron interactions,@xcite and so on.@xcite meanwhile , the other theories , such as the molecular dynamics,@xcite the percolation theory,@xcite and those considering the trapping mechanism,@xcite are applied extensively to complement the discussions of this incoherent hopping .",
    "especially , the dynamic disorder model has already been put into the monte carlo simulation under the displaced harmonic oscillator approximation,@xcite which is somehow different from the present treatment .",
    "fundamentally , the m - a formula , coinciding with the detailed balance , is related to a single phonon process , such that the energy difference between initial and final site must be comparable with the highest energy of phonons that could effectively interact with carriers.@xcite hence , the hopping mechanism based on m - a formula could be described like this:@xcite initially a few of vibrational modes ( phonons ) are excited , such that the carriers could be heated up to make the energy levels of two neighboring sites coincide , and then the phonon transit its energy to the carrier to assist it hopping .",
    "this mechanism correspondingly provides an intuitive picture to understand the application of m - a formula in the case of low carrier s density,@xcite but in common cases , the vibrational modes are quite diverse , which means the single phonon process loses its efficiency .",
    "hence , a converted picture of incoherent hopping should be addressed , which is one of the main subject in this work .      in organic materials ,",
    "charge carriers move in a complicated environment , which is mainly composed of the disorders of molecular configurations and vibrations , and decoherence happens incessantly .",
    "normally , the high frequency modes of intermolecular vibration ( fast interaction ) could be realized to be the source of decoherence , while the lower ones ( slow interaction ) is referred to a thermal reservoir as in dynamic disorder model discussed in below.@xcite the typical decoherence time is of the order @xmath2ps in organic materials with good conductivity,@xcite such as in c60 , where the frequency of center - of - mass motion is observed to be 1.2thz,@xcite but in more amorphous materials , the value should be smaller .",
    "the common method treating decoherence in molecular systems is to add some fluctuation and dissipation to the model and evaluate the corresponding green s function.@xcite obviously , this method is invalid for the dynamic disorder model , in which the motion of lattice sites must be calculated within real spacetime .",
    "so here we will describe a more efficient picture for the decoherence process,@xcite which is straightforward from a so - called coarse graining method.@xcite    to this end , we take two molecules indexed by 1 and 2 as an example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ decoherence ] .",
    "initially , there is a carrier residing in molecule 1 as a localized wavepacket .",
    "it will spread following the equation of motion , @xmath3,\\label{eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the tool of density matrix @xmath4\\right)$ ] for convenience to understand decoherence .",
    "@xmath5 in ( [ eom ] ) is the hamiltonian considering the simplest hopping term of polarons , namely , @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) creates ( annihilates ) a polaron at @xmath9-th molecule , @xmath10 the intermolecular overlap integral of electronic wavefunctions .",
    "when the frequency of vibration is high enough , the vibrational modes make the decoherence happen very quickly,@xcite such that we can define a decoherence time @xmath11 , within which the carrier will lose its coherence and the off - diagonal terms @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 carrying the phase information of the system vanish.@xcite normally , @xmath11 is of the order of @xmath14.@xcite after @xmath11 , the pure density matrix @xmath15 becomes a statistical mixture , and due to the vanishing of overlap between 1 and 2 , the system could be realized to be a classical ensemble with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the probability that the carrier is residing in molecule 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "one can then produce a random number @xmath18 as the procedure in monte carlo simulation . if @xmath19 , the carrier will be chosen to reside in molecule 2 after @xmath11 , and one step of the incoherent hopping finishes .",
    "otherwise , the carrier remains at molecule 1 , and the above process restarts .",
    "this provides the generalized picture of decoherence .",
    ", its wavepacket will spread to molecule 2 .",
    "then the correlation between the two molecules is quenched due to the decoherence , and it will be decided whether one try of the incoherent hopping is successful .",
    "if yes , the polaron will hop to molecule 2 , otherwise the whole process restarts . ]      in the common studies of charge transport in organics , the coherent motion of carriers could be simulated within both adiabatic@xcite and nonadiabatic@xcite dynamical method . as well , when one wants to study the incoherent hopping only , the marcus theory based on lattice relaxation and level crossing is frequently used.@xcite green s function was also evaluated to distinguish incoherent and coherent process.@xcite in this subsection , we will develop such a method that merges both coherent and incoherent process on the basis of decoherence as we described above .",
    "the central task is that , when a carrier is initially residing in a molecule , we need to find a way to determine the probability that a carrier hops out of the initial molecule .",
    "the procedure of our treatment is as follows .",
    "initially , there is a carrier localized at molecule @xmath2 ( or the central site of the chain , as discussed below ) , that is , the initial state of the system is @xmath20 ) .",
    "since the carrier loses its coherence every @xmath11 as discussed above , it will choose a molecule ( e.g. , molecule @xmath21 ) to reside in based on the probability at this molecule at @xmath11 .",
    "it means that , we calculate the probability of carrier at molecule @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 with @xmath23 the state of system at time @xmath11 , and then make @xmath24 the hopping probability that the carrier hops out of the initial molecule .",
    "this treatment is almost the same with the process of decoherence as we discussed above .    obviously , when @xmath11 is small enough , it is extremely difficult for a carrier to hop out of the initial molecule by one try .",
    "so the key step of the present theory is that , when the try fails , namely the carrier keeps at the initial molecule , the wavefunction of system will be projected onto the initial molecule , and continue evolving .",
    "that is , a new round of evolution starts with the renewed projective initial state @xmath25 after normalizing @xmath26 by making the above steps recur .",
    "of course , if necessary , @xmath11 could also be randomly selected .",
    "now , we have in hand a series of time - dependent @xmath27 , which is different from those time - independent hopping rates in gdm , so the remaining question is to determine the waiting time @xmath28 for a carrier residing in the initial molecule . following the usual idea of monte carlo simulation",
    ", we sum up @xmath27 and make the hopping happen when the summation result exceeds a given random number , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 . in case for simplicity , the right hand side of ( [ inte ] ) could also be replaced by @xmath2 .",
    "then the waiting time is @xmath31 the above procedure could obviously be generalized for different systems beyond two molecules . in the following",
    ", we will apply it to the dynamic disorder model .    before moving on to the next subsection",
    ", we would like to say that , the projective method we describe here is almost the same with the coarse graining method , with the only difference that the projection is acting within the real space other than energy space.@xcite so that , the basic drawback of ehrenfest method we will use shortly , such as the deviation of superposition principle , is overcome in some sense .",
    "meanwhile , the sudden switching method of electronic states in molecular dynamics is used for reference of the monte carlo simulation.@xcite equivalently , as we will show later , one can also use a rate equation with the off - diagonal decay term to calculate the diffusion process , which will give similar results with the present theory in some case .",
    "but for a multi - site system , since the velocities of decay of the off - diagonal term are not exactly the same , the rate equation becomes quite complicated and inefficient in practise .",
    "this is why we consider the projective procedure here .",
    "the dynamic disorder model recommended by troisi is a quite simple but efficient one in the study of charge transport in organics.@xcite the basic idea is to use a one - dimensional ssh - like hamiltonian to describe the coupling between charge carriers and intermolecular vibrational mode . since the initial distribution of vibrational mode is dependent on temperature , the disorder introduced by this electron - phonon coupling is changeable with temperature , which implies the original meaning of the words `` dynamics disorder '' .",
    "the model hamiltonian writes , @xmath32 the electronic part is @xmath33(c^\\dagger_{j+1}c_{j}+h.c.),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 creates ( annihilates ) a carrier on the @xmath35-th site .",
    "@xmath36 represents the displacement of the @xmath35-th site .",
    "@xmath37 is the transfer integral and @xmath38 is the electron - lattice coupling constant .",
    "the vibrational part of hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) is described as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the elastic constant between neighbor sites and @xmath41 the mass of a site .",
    "the parameters are chosen to the similar ones as in [ 10 ] .",
    "that is , @xmath42amu ps@xmath43 , @xmath44amu , @xmath45@xmath46 , @xmath47@xmath48 , and the lattice constant is @xmath49 .",
    "the number of site for the chain will be set to sufficiently large , such that the diffusive wavepacket of carrier can not reach the end of the chain .",
    "based on this hamiltonian , we could use the ehrenfest method to calculate the diffusion of an initially localized wavepacket of carrier.@xcite the initial state could have several forms and result in slightly different trajectories , but the basic behavior does not change.@xcite in this work , the initial electronic state we choose is to locate a carrier at a single site , e.g. the central site of the chain .",
    "and the initial condition of vibrations is under thermal equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be randomly chosen in a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , with @xmath54 the temperature .",
    "then we apply the time - dependent schrdinger equation for electronic part and newtonian equation for vibrational part to compute the time evolution of the whole system .    in the original treatment of troisi",
    ", the evolution time should be long enough to ensure the saturation of diffusion coefficient .",
    "but in the present work , we calculate the evolution for each round to the time @xmath11 and then make a decision whether the carrier could hop out of the initial site .",
    "the whole calculating procedure for electronic part is almost the same as described in above subsections .",
    "however , as we are now facing a multi - site system , we treat the initial site as molecule 1 and the others as molecule 2 , and after the hopping is determined , we need to produce another random number to determine which site the electron should go . on the other hand , the evolution of vibrational part will be successive during the decision of the final site of electron .",
    "the quantities we compute are the diffusion coefficient defined as @xmath55 with @xmath56 the distance between the initial site and the final site that the carrier hops to , whose mean value is the diffusion length as we will show in below .",
    "of course , if necessary , the mobility could be calculated by einstein relation,@xcite but einstein relation is violated under nonequilibrium condition,@xcite such that the validity to use it here should be doubted .",
    "so we did not plan to plot it in the present work .",
    "in fig . [ troisi ] , we show the comparison between the present theory and others .",
    "firstly , under the parameters that troisi has used,@xcite we change the value of @xmath11 and calculate the same quantity with troisi , i.e. , the averaged squared displacement .",
    "the red lines are from our projective method , while the blue ones are from the calculation based on the master equation . for the latter case ,",
    "we add an exponential decay term with variance @xmath11 for all the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix and calculate the evolution and the physical quantities we want .",
    "this treatment is an intuitive way to treat the decoherence at least in two - site systems .    as shown in left panels of fig .",
    "[ troisi ] , following the @xmath11 decreasing , the diffusion becomes much slower than troisi s results , say no decoherence case .",
    "meanwhile , when the @xmath37 and @xmath38 reduce by one order , the reduction of diffusion coefficient becomes quite large .",
    "these results clearly show that , when the decoherence is presence , the ability of charge transport becomes poorer , and as we will show shortly , the type transits from bandlike to hopping transport . on the other hand ,",
    "the results from the present projective method are very close to those from the master equation , but the computational efficiency improves a lot .          , @xmath11 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the values of @xmath38 is in the unit of @xmath46 . ]",
    "the most important characteristic difference between bandlike and hopping transport is that , for the former one the diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing temperature due to the thermal induced dynamic disorder ( say , a power law scaling @xmath57 ) , while for the latter case the diffusion coefficient increases with increasing temperature due to the thermal assisted mechanism ( @xmath58 ) . in troisi",
    "s original studies , only bandlike transport was found for all the range of parameters . here in fig .",
    "[ hopping ] , we show for different parameters the diffusion coefficient .",
    "our results clearly show that , when @xmath37 is small ( @xmath59@xmath48 , which is the typical value in organic small molecules ) , there is only positive temperature dependence of diffusion coefficient . while when @xmath37 is large ( @xmath60@xmath48 , which is the typical value in pentacene ) , there is only a negative and power law ( @xmath61 ) temperature dependence . in between ( @xmath62@xmath48 ) ,",
    "both positive and negative temperature dependence emerge . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hopping](b ) , when we change @xmath11 , we find a critical region of the transition between bandlike ( low temperature ) to hopping ( high temperature ) transport , and the transition point is around 100k .",
    "this is the most important finding in this work .",
    "the explanation of these results is that , for large @xmath37 , the case is the same with that discussed in dynamic disorder model,@xcite while for small @xmath37 , the carrier has little time to diffuse to other sites , but some phonon induced potential well could assist carrier to move .",
    "so in the latter case , temperature plays a positive role , and the type of transport becomes incoherent hopping .",
    "more interpretation will be addressed shortly when we study the diffusion length .",
    "in addition , to get the sense of the influence of electron - phonon coupling , we also show the results with @xmath63@xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ hopping](c )",
    ". based upon our calculation , the transition region from bandlike to incoherent hopping is insensitive to @xmath38 except some quantitative change , which means the dynamic disorder itself does not influence the transition of the two type of transport .",
    "as we have mentioned , the temperature dependence is mostly negative in crystalline organic semiconductors , whose mechanism should be bandlike transport . here , applying the physics of decoherence , we obtain both positive and negative temperature dependence for different @xmath37 and temperature . for the typical value of @xmath37 in pentacene , namely @xmath60@xmath48",
    ", it shows negative temperature dependence , which is the same with the result in dynamic disorder model.@xcite it implies that , in this material , bandlike mechanism dominates the charge transport , and the role of decoherence is just to decrease the diffusion coefficient as we will discuss later on .",
    "however , the value of @xmath37 in other organic materials , such as alq@xmath65 , is about two order smaller than that in pentacene , i.e. , @xmath66@xmath48 , so the temperature dependence becomes positive .",
    "hence , in common organic semiconductors under room temperature , the characteristic of hopping transport should be more frequently observed .      .",
    "@xmath62@xmath48 and @xmath67@xmath46 ]    the spatial extent of carriers is a controversial but crucial issue in this field .",
    "understanding of it is essentially helpful to clarify the interplay between bandlike and hopping transport .",
    "the former corresponds to a delocalized picture , while the latter is to the localized one .",
    "especially , since the localization length in pentacene is estimated to be about @xmath0 molecules,@xcite this value could be directly utilized to estimate the decoherence time in pentacene . within the present theory , we can also calculate the diffusion length within @xmath28 as the average distance between initial and final site that before and after carrier hops .",
    "obviously , when @xmath11 is very large , our result should be the same with troisis.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ dlength ] , it is found that , with @xmath69ps , the carrier could diffuse over about @xmath70 sites , that is , the spatial extent of the carrier is about @xmath0 times intermolecular distance , which is very close to the experimental prediction in pentacene.@xcite hence , we can safely say that , @xmath2ps is the typical order of decoherence time in pentacene .",
    "besides , with small @xmath11 , the carrier is only localized within the next - nearest sites , such that , hopping transport should be the dominant for this case .",
    "correspondingly , with temperature increasing , the large @xmath11 curves decrease first and then increase slightly , while the small @xmath11 curve does almost not change .",
    "this means , for the bandlike transport , the spatial extent of carriers should decrease with increasing temperature , while for the hopping transport , the carrier is mainly localized .",
    "the results for other parameters are similar , so we do not show here .",
    ", the carrier is mainly localized in one molecule , such that temperature acts as an assistance . for large @xmath11",
    ", the wavepacket of carrier is extended , and temperature produces disorders for the carrier s diffusion .",
    "[ trans ] ]    the physical picture of these results is quite different from that in the traditional understanding of incoherent hopping , where the carrier residing in a trap would tunnel to another one with similar energy.@xcite this mechanism works based upon the simple phonon structure and dilute impurities in inorganic semiconductors . in organic semiconductors ,",
    "however , due to the dynamic disorder each molecule might be treated as a trap and the phononic environment is quite diverse .",
    "so the basic point for the dynamics disorder model is , in our opinion , not the energy difference between molecules , but how long the carrier spreads .",
    "[ trans ] shows a brief schematic for the present theory .",
    "when @xmath11 is small , the hopping is mainly between two neighbor molecules . in this case ,",
    "due to the thermal motion of each molecule , the intermolecular distance eventually decreases when the temperature is sufficiently high , such that the hopping rate should be larger than that under low temperature .",
    "this is actually the temperature assisted hopping .",
    "while when @xmath11 is large , that is , the carrier is much easier to spread out to several sites , the thermal motion of molecules behaves now as the disordered obstacles .",
    "so in this case , temperature will act to produce more and more scattering to the carriers and then block the carrier s motion .      .",
    "@xmath60@xmath48 , @xmath67@xmath46 , and @xmath71k .",
    "the dashed line denotes the diffusion coefficient obtained in ref . [ 10].[td ] ]    in the present theory , the decoherence time @xmath11 is the most important parameter . in fig .",
    "[ td ] , we show the dependence of diffusion coefficient on @xmath11 . as expected , the diffusion coefficient increases following the increasing @xmath11 , and when @xmath72ps , diffusion coefficient tends to saturate to the result from troisi.@xcite this is easy to understand , since when @xmath11 is extremely small , it is quite hard for a carrier to hop out of the initial site .",
    "it is worth noting that , the estimated value of mobility in dynamics disorder model is slightly larger than that from experiment , say @xmath73@xmath74s@xmath75v@xmath75 from theory and @xmath2@xmath74s@xmath75v@xmath75 from experiment.@xcite the present theory based on the decoherence might be the solution to this difference .",
    "furthermore , the experiment on organic field effect transistor has shown that , when the drain voltage is large , the temperature coefficient is negative , and for the inverse case , it is positive.@xcite this could also be explained in the present theoretical framework . in case",
    "the drain voltage is large , the waiting time @xmath28 in each molecule should be small .",
    "considering the ratio between @xmath28 and @xmath11 that , the smaller the @xmath28 , the larger the @xmath11 , the relationship of mobility with drain voltage could be easily understood .",
    "actually , the influence of phonons on charge transport in organic semiconductors has been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "however , the meaning of `` incoherent hopping '' in organic materials is still obscure in our opinion , since the widely used m - a formula is not such applicable for organic molecules .",
    "meanwhile , as we show in this work , hopping and bandlike transport happens at different time scales .",
    "the first case refers to decoherence time of the same order with relaxation time of phonon so that phonon is able to transfer its energy to the carrier to assist it hopping , while the second case functions when @xmath11 is large enough to ensure the time for scattering between carriers and phonons . in a real material ,",
    "there are many ways to adapt these two conditions and make the type of transport transit from hopping to bandlike . furthermore ,",
    "under low temperature , tunneling might become dominating , and carriers will search for a molecule out of the trap which has closest energy to tunnel to , i.e. , mott s variable range hopping mechanism.@xcite this case has not been addressed in the present work .    in the end , we would like to discuss more on the present theory .",
    "firstly , the practical device parameters , such as electric field , have not been explicitly included , which could be easily considered within the present framework .",
    "for example , the electric field could be regarded as a phase factor in the hopping constant,@xcite but for the common ehrenfest method , this way loses its efficiency due to the bloch oscillation .",
    "especially , based on the study of electric field , we might discuss the validity of einstein relation in these systems.@xcite secondly , it is straightforward to replace the dynamic disorder model discussed in the present work , such as holstein model , spin - boson model , etc .",
    "especially , since the spin motion in organic materials is always realized to be coherent , it could be easily incorporated into the present theory , and the hot debated magnetic field effect could be studied.@xcite thirdly , the theory could be applied to estimate the corresponding decoherence time in the specific material , since it is the only adjustable parameter .",
