    "there has been a growing demand for an efficient method of generating a spin current because it is a key quantity in driving the functionality of spintronic devices  @xcite . in the early days ,",
    "an idea of electrical spin current injection from a metallic ferromagnet into nonmagnetic metals or semiconductors was theoretically proposed  @xcite , and later on , it was successfully demonstrated in experiments  @xcite .",
    "although such a technique is by now recognized as a standard method for the spin current injection  @xcite , the method suffers from a problem called impedance mismatch , which means that a huge reduction in the spin injection efficiency appears when there is a large difference in resistivity between the ferromagnetic spin current injector and the spin current sink  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such an electrical spin injection method is available only when _ both _ the spin current injector and the spin current sink are electrically conducting .",
    "recently a completely different type of spin injection method , termed spin pumping  @xcite , has attracted much attention as an alternative and efficient way for the spin injection  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "nonequilibrium dynamics of magnetization in a ferromagnet injector is driven by ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) , and the precessing magnetization `` pumps '' spins into an adjacent spin sink by transferring spin angular momentum through the @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange interaction at the interface .",
    "the fmr - driven spin pumping has an advantage that it is unaccompanied by any charge transfer across the spin injector / spin sink interface , such that it is free from the impedance mismatch problem and thus available even when the injector is an insulating magnet  @xcite .",
    "because of this versatility , the spin pumping in a variety of systems is now a subject of intensive research  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a spin injection from permalloy ( py ) into gaas by means of the spin pumping , which would otherwise suffer from the impedance mismatch problem , was successfully demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "originally , the fmr - driven spin pumping is formulated  @xcite in a close analogy to a theory of adiabatic charge pumping in mesoscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the spin pumping is then characterized by a quantity called _ spin mixing conductance _",
    "@xmath4 , the value of which may be calculated by the landauer - bttiker approach combined with first - principles calculation  @xcite .",
    "however the physical meaning of @xmath4 and its microscopic origin are obscure in the existing literature  @xcite , and moreover , there is no knowledge at present on how to take account of many - body effects in the spin pumping theory .",
    "by contrast , the linear - response formalism is a powerful theoretical framework to describe nonequilibrium phenomena near thermal equilibrium . in particular , it is amenable to the language of the magnetism community , and more importantly , it has an advantage that it can easily deal with many - body effects when combined with a field - theoretical approach  @xcite . in the context of spintronics ,",
    "the linear - response approach has greatly contributed to the progress in a thermal version of the spin pumping , termed the spin seebeck effect  @xcite .",
    "it was not until the advent of the linear - response formulation of the spin seebeck effect  @xcite that a description of the phonon - drag process  @xcite , which is now recognized as one of the principal mechanisms of the spin seebeck effect  @xcite , was made possible .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to develop a linear - response formulation of the spin pumping in order to describe many - body effects .    in this paper , we develop a linear - response theory of the fmr - driven dc spin pumping by using field - theoretical methods  @xcite in order to clarify the role of many - body effects .",
    "we investigate intriguing effects of critical spin fluctuations on the spin pumping , and show that when a metallic ferromagnet near the curie temperature @xmath0 is used as the spin sink , the spin pumping is largely enhanced owing to the fluctuation enhancement of the spin conductance across the spin injector / spin sink interface .",
    "central to the above argument is the fact that the interface spin conductance ( conventionally denoted as @xmath5 ) is proportional to the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility of the spin sink , @xmath6 , which is known to be largely enhanced near @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the interface spin conductance is effectively enhanced if the spin sink is made of an itinerant ferromagnet close to @xmath0 , and that the resultant spin pumping attains a large enhancement .",
    "this argument is justified in this work by a microscopic analysis which is supplemented by the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of spin fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "we introduce a model hamiltonian to describe the dc spin pumping . in sec .",

    "the enhancement can be detected experimentally by observing either the additional gilbert damping  @xcite or the pumped spin current  @xcite .",
    "note that this enhanced spin pumping should be distinguished from the fluctuation effects on the spin hall angle  @xcite . in refs .   and , the anomaly in the inverse spin hall effect at @xmath0 due to skew scattering in nipd alloy has been studied ( see the inset of fig .
