    "in fact , a skyrmion lattice , was recently identified unambiguously at ambient pressure in a small phase pocket just below @xmath10 , which is believed to be stabilized by thermal fluctuations @xcite . to resolve the origin of these exciting properties it has become of great importance in its own right to establish at first a full account of the normal helimagnetic state and its spectrum of excitations .",
    "this has also inspired the experimental study presented here .",
    "+ the three different energy scales governing the physics of the helimagnetic state of mnsi result in four different regimes for spin excitations . as a function of increasing momentum of the excitations these regimes",

    "explores the antiferromagnetic limit , @xmath11 , where a linear spectrum of spin waves is expected . here",
    "@xmath12 is the wavevector measured from the ordering vector @xmath13 of the helix and @xmath14 measures the weak pinning of the orientation of the helix to the crystalline lattice , which is fourth order in spin orbit coupling ( @xmath14 is expected to be of the order of @xmath15 and therefore extremely tiny ) .",

    "+ the magnetic phase diagram of mnsi is remarkably rich . for small magnetic fields between of 0.05 t and 0.15 t",
    "a reorientation transition takes place and the helimagnetic modulation aligns with the applied field to form the so - called conical phase .",
    "the helical modulation is suppressed for fields above @xmath23 .",
    "finally , a small phase pocket just below @xmath10 has been identified recently as the first example of a skyrmion lattice , thereby demonstrating the inherent instability of the helical order to stabilize non - trivial spin textures in small magnetic fields .",
    "+ for a comprehensive understanding it is consequently important to measure the spin excitations in the prestine ( zero - field cooled ) helical state .",
    "this has not been attempted before , since four equally populated domains form , all of which contribute to the full spectrum of the spin excitations , as described below . in the following",
    "we denote these domains as follows : domain 1 corresponds to @xmath24 , domain 2 corresponds to @xmath25 , domain 3 corresponds to @xmath26 , and domain 4 corresponds to @xmath27 ( cf .",

    "for the experiment the single crystal was cooled with an ill - type orange he - cryostat .",
    "the sample was oriented with the [ 1,1,0 ] and [ 0,0,1 ] crystallographic directions in the scattering plane . in order to avoid second order contamination of the neutron",

    "for setup i the triple - axis spectrometer was operated with fixed final wave vector @xmath32 = 1.2  @xmath33 .",

    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the resolution achieved was about the best currently available .",

    "the background was carefully measured at positions in reciprocal space that were not contaminated by inelastic scattering around the @xmath31 bragg reflection and was estimated as 20 counts/25 min .",
    "+ finally , some of the energy scans measured during the course of our experiments were contaminated by spurious scattering that was effectively caused by neutrons that were scattered incoherently from the monochromator crystals of the used triple - axis spectrometer ( see e.g. open symbols fig .",

    "this type of spurious scattering is well - known as currat - axe peaks in the literature @xcite . for the analysis we considered",
    "only scans where the spurious scattering could be separated well from the inelastic signal .",
    "all scans shown in the following were performed at a temperature of 20  k. this way the intensity was strong while still being significantly below @xmath10 deep inside the helical phase . summarized in fig.[figure1](d ) are the locations in reciprocal space where we have recorded excitation spectra .",
    "a total of 24 spectra were recorded . to cover the regime of interest near the magnetic ordering wave vector we have mostly carried out inelastic scans at reciprocal lattice positions along three traces in reciprocal space as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](d ) .",
    "two traces ( square and rhombus symbols ) were selected such that they are parallel and perpendicular to @xmath42 , while the third trace ( circle symbols ) was recorded along an arbitrary direction .",
    "the latter may be seen as the most stringent test of the theoretical model used to describe the experimental data .",

    "the scattering intensity observed experimentally is hence the result of contributions from each of the domains , that is , most of the scattering wave vectors were neither perfectly parallel nor perfectly perpendicular to the ordering wave vector .",
    "+ prior to our study we expected spectra that are strongly reminiscent of the excitations of the ferromagnetic limit . in stark contrast , we observed highly anomalous line shapes that appear to be inconsistent with any conventional scenario .",
    "for instance , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) and ( b ) are typical data for @xmath43 ( squares in fig.[figure1 ] ) . here",
    "the data are characterized by fairly broad dispersive maxima , but a naive interpretation of the data suggests an extreme form of broadening .",

    "finally , the data for the arbitrary direction shown in fig.[figure2](e ) and ( f ) display yet another type of characteristic , namely distinct maxima suggesting a well defined intense mode on a large background of scattering . + the remarkable variety of seemingly anomalous spectra",
    "we observe experimentally certainly does not look reminiscent of ferromagnetic spin waves at all . in a first attempt we tried to fit each scan individually with one or several gaussians .",
    "however , this procedure failed . recognizing that our data was taken for wave vectors much smaller than the fermi momentum , @xmath45 , in principle",
    ", the spectra should be insensitive to most microscopic details .",
    "we have therefore set up an effective model to calculate the excitation spectra based on two physically transparent and meaningful parameters , namely the ferromagnetic spin wave stiffness @xmath46  mev@xmath47 derived from previous experiments @xcite and the pitch of the helical modulation @xmath48  @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed description of the theoretical model will be given in the following section  [ theory ] .",
    "to compare the calculated spectra with our data we folded them with the energy and momentum resolution of our measurements ( which is about the best currently available ) and adjusted the absolute value of the intensity .",
    "we emphasize that the scaling of the intensity of all spectra by the same value represents the only free parameter of our model . +",
    "our theoretical model gives complete and precise account of _ all measured features and lineshapes for all momenta _ as illustrated in fig.[figure2 ] for six of the 24 spectra we have measured .",
    "the agreement between the calculated spectra and the experimental data can be quantified by the remarkably small value of the reduced @xmath49 value of @xmath50 .",
    "we thereby note that we used a rather conservative estimate of the instrumental resolution , which tentatively averages out small details that may possibly exist in the data .",
    "these underestimates of the experimental resolution are quite typical and observed in many inelastic neutron scattering studies .",
    "further , when artificially modifying the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 by more than @xmath53 the quality of the agreement as measured by @xmath49 deteriorates rapidly .",
    "this suggests strongly that our model sensitively captures the entire physics of all excitation spectra measured .",
    "as a starting point of a detailed account of our theoretical description we emphasize again , that the weakness of spin - orbit coupling in mnsi leads to well - separated energy and length scales .",
    "the underlying physics is based on the properties of a ferromagnet . at energies below @xmath54mev , where the spin - flip stoner continuum sets in @xcite , and for corresponding small momenta , @xmath55 ,",
    "the low - energy excitations of the ferromagnet in the absence of spin - orbit interactions are described with high precision by a simple quadratic dispersion @xmath56 . at the small wave vectors relevant for our experiment the damping of those modes",
    "may be neglected .",
    "+ accordingly , the starting point of our theoretical description is a rotationally invariant non - linear @xmath57 model ( including the appropriate berry - phase term ) to describe the low - energy excitations of this ferromagnet .",
    "following ref .  , we add to this model the leading spin - orbit coupling effect , which is given by the rotationally invariant dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xmath58 .",
    "being linear in momentum , the dm interactions necessarily lead to an instability of the ferromagnet and stabilize a chiral helix of the form @xmath59 where the unit vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 are perpendicular to each other and to the ordering vector @xmath13 . in our mnsi crystals",
