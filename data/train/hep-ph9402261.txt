    "during the last few years a big effort has been made in order to state the theoretical predictions for k- and b - meson physics on a more solid ground .",
    "our interest in k- and b - physics is due both to theoretical and experimental reasons . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this kind of physics is the natural framework to analyze and test the mechanisms of flavour mixing and cp violation proposed in the standard model and beyond .",
    "@xmath2 ( f = flavour ) mixings , @xmath3 weak decays ( and related asymmetries ) , rare k- and b - decays provide in principle all the necessary tools for a full - fledged analysis of this important aspect of the present phenomenology of elementary particle physics .",
    "several `` still missing '' parameters of the standard model , tipically the ones related to the top quark  as the top mass ( @xmath4 ) and couplings ( @xmath5 )  can be constrained by cp violation and flavour mixing results : a real alternative prediction to the pure electroweak determinations , moreover improvable in the near future .    on the other hand , the nowadays theoretical enthusiasm is supported by an exciting experimental scenario , where more and more precision is reached in single measurements or expected in first generation experiments .",
    "this is expecially the case of b - physics , so extensively discussed at this conference , and of @xmath1 , the _ direct _ cp violation parameter in kaon decays into two pions .",
    "the smallness of this cp violation parameter , due both to its _ radiative _ origin and to its intrinsic dependence on the @xmath6 _ rule _",
    "@xcite , is at the same time the origin of its interest and of its illness .",
    "@xmath1 is today still compatible with zero , both theoretically and experimentally . at the same time it is crucial to state if it vanishes , in order to trust the standard model or not .",
    "thus , it is a real challenge to reduce more and more all the uncertainties in the problem .",
    "our contribution in this direction has been the calculation of the effective hamiltonian for @xmath7 weak decays at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd and qed .",
    "the effective hamiltonian formalism is the typical framework for the analytical calculation of the physical amplitudes for weak processes , i.e. in a theory where very large masses and mass gaps are present . within this formalism",
    ", the hamiltonian which describes a given physical process is expressed as a linear combination of effective operators with certain wilson coefficients . in so doing , the perturbative and non - perturbative realms factorize and we can fully exploit our analytical capabilities in calculating the wilson coefficients at a given perturbative order , while taking the operator matrix elements from some non - perturbative results .",
    "they are precisely the non - perturbative inputs which represent the `` dark side '' of the problem , being affected by very large uncertainties , which show up not only in the operator matrix elements , but also in some physical input parameters ( like the ckm parameters , etc . )",
    "whose prediction relies on some `` long - distance physics '' .",
    "taking `` long - distance physics '' from lattice qcd ( just a method among others , to be predictive from a quantitative point of view ) , our effort has been to state the perturbative calculation of the wilson coefficients on a more solid ground .",
    "a nlo effective hamiltonian constitutes a more reliable result in many respects : the @xmath8-dependence is greatly reduced ( @xmath8 being the scale of matching between wilson coefficients and matrix elements ) ; @xmath9 can be properly taken from other experiments which use nlo results ; the stability of the perturbative expansion can be tested ; the dependence on the heavy masses of the theory can be precisely taken into account and enforced .",
    "moreover , the results obtained in the calculation of the @xmath7 effective hamiltonian can be easily generalized to the case of other effective hamiltonians , in the standard model or even beyond it .    for all these reasons and many others i do not detail here",
    ", we think that this calculation will be important , even if , as we will show in the phenomenological analysis , for the time being the theoretical prediction for @xmath1 is not adequate to be competitive with the improvements of the experimental measurements in the near future .",
    "i would like to report here about some main points in the theoretical calculation of the effective hamiltonian which describes @xmath10 decays and @xmath1 .",
    "i will recall the general construction of the effective hamiltonian for the physical problem at hand , the importance of the matching between `` short - distance '' and `` long - distance '' physics , the independence of any physical result from the matching scale and its consequences .",
    "i will finally present the nlo solution of the evolution equation for the wilson coefficients and discuss the regularization scheme independence of the final result .",
    "full details and references about each single point can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most general effective hamiltonian can be written , using the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the product of the two original weak currents as : & & f _ eff^s=1i + & & d^4 x d_w(x^2 , m_w^2 ) f t ( j_(x),j^_(0 ) ) i + & & _ if o _ i ( ) i c _ i ( ) = o^t ( ) c()[ope ] where @xmath11 is a complete basis of independent operators ( which mix under renormalization , when qcd and qed corrections are taken into account ) , appropriate to the physical problem at hand , and @xmath12 the related wilson coefficients . for the specific case of the @xmath13 effective hamiltonian",
    ", we have used the following basis made of vertex - type and penguin - type operators : o _ 1&=&(|s_u_)_(v - a ) ( |u_d_)_(v - a ) + o _ 2&=&(|s_u_)_(v - a ) ( |u_d_)_(v - a ) + o _ 3,5 & = & ( |s_d_)_(v - a ) _ q = u , d , s,(|q_q_)_(va ) + o _ 4,6 & = & ( |s_d_)_(v - a ) _ q = u , d , s,(|q_q_)_(va ) + o _ 7,9 & = & ( |s_d_)_(v - a ) _ q = u , d , s , e _",

    "q(|q_q_)_(va ) + o^c _ 1&=&(|s_c_)_(v - a ) ( |c_d_)_(v - a ) + o^c _ 2&=&(|s_c_)_(v - a ) ( |c_d_)_(v - a ) [ opbasis ] where the subscript @xmath14 indicates the chiral structure and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are colour indices .",
    "the sum is intended over those flavours which are active at the scale @xmath8 .",
    "the factorization of @xmath17 in operator matrix elements and wilson coefficients is completely arbitrary .",
    "it depends on the scale @xmath8 at which we decide to match the `` short - distance '' and `` long - distance '' physics .",
    "but the final physical amplitude must be @xmath8-independent . imposing this condition , a renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the wilson coefficients",
    "can be derived . when both qcd ( @xmath18 ) and qed ( @xmath19 ) radiative corrections are taken into account ,",
    "the rge for the coefficients is : ( - + ( ) - ) c(t , ( t ) , ) & = & 0 + & & [ rge ] where ( in the case of a weak interaction effective theory ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 and in particular we ignore the running of @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of eq.([rge ] ) gives the evolution of the coefficients with the mass scale @xmath8 and depends on @xmath22 ( the qcd @xmath16-function ) , @xmath23 ( the qcd+qed anomalous dimension matrix ) and the value of the coefficients at a given initial scale ( initial conditions for the solution of the rge ) .",
    "all these quantities are perturbative objects , expanded in powers of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( or in powers of @xmath24 in a leading logarithm expansion ) . thus the solution of eq.([rge",
    "] ) has also to be specified at a given order , f.i .",
    "lo ( leading order ) , nlo ( next - to - leading order ) , etc .",
    "our result concerns the nlo evolution of the wilson coefficients . assuming",
    "the initial value of the coefficients to be @xmath25 @xcite , their value at the scale @xmath8 will be given in term of the evolution matrix @xmath26 $ ] as : c ( ) = c ( ) [ evo ] consider the perturbative expansion of @xmath22 and @xmath23 : ( ) = - _ 0 - _ 1 + o(^4 ) [ betafun ] & = & _ s^(0 ) + _ e^(0)+ + & & ( ) ^2 _ s^(1 ) + _ e^(1 ) [ dimanom ] where @xmath27 are @xmath28 matrices expressing the mixing under renormalization ( at one and two loops respectively ) among the operators in eq.([opbasis ] ) .",
    "then at the nlo in qcd and qed , when only one power of @xmath19 is taken into account ( @xmath29 negligible for @xmath30 .",
    "this means that terms of order @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are resummed in the leading - log expansion ) , the evolution matrix @xmath26 $ ] is of the form : = [ monster ] with : & = & ( 1 + ) ( 1 + ) + & & ( 1 + ) [ mo1 ] and & = & ( 1- ) + & & ( 1 - ) ( 1 - ) [ mo2 ] here @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are recursively determined by a set of complicate equations i do not report here ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) and results to be functions of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    on the other hand , the nlo initial conditions @xmath25 , defined by matching the full theory with the effective one at the @xmath42 scale and at order @xmath43 , are of the form : c ( ) & = & t^(0 ) + ( t^(1 ) - r^t t^(0 ) ) + + & & ( d^(1 ) - s^t t^(0 ) ) [ coeic ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent the coefficients obtained calculating the one loop matching at the scale @xmath42 , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 express the mixing in the operator matrix elements , at the @xmath42 scale and at the given order ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "both @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on the external states chosen for the feynman diagrams involved in their calculation .",
    "however in the final expression for the @xmath25 coefficients this dependence cancels .",
    "any `` unbalanced '' modifications of the initial condition @xmath48 will break this cancellation and the dependence on the external states must be recovered by the operator matrix elements at the @xmath42 scale , as we have indeed verified .",
    "our contribution has been the calculation of @xmath49 with respect to the operator basis in eq .",
    "( [ opbasis ] ) and the development of the whole formalism summarized up to here in order to get the nlo answer for the wilson coefficients .",
    "we have worked in the modified minimal subtraction renormalization scheme ( @xmath50 ) and in two different regularization schemes : naive dimensional reduction ( ndr ) and t hooft - veltman scheme ( hv ) .",
    "the regularization scheme independence of the final result has been demonstrated and explicitely checked . on this point",
    "we agree with the only other similar calculation in the literature @xcite , while a difference on two single diagrams is still present ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the scheme - dependent objects in the calculation are those involving divergent parts of two - loop feynman diagrams or finite parts of one - loop feynman diagrams , i.e. @xmath39 on one side and @xmath44 , @xmath51 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 on the other ( for the list of the feynman diagrams contributing at different levels see ref .",
    "however , they enter the final expression for the evoluted coefficients @xmath52 in a scheme independent combination .",
    "the final results for the nlo coefficients can be given in any definite regularization scheme , provided that the relative operator matrix elements are also calculated in the same scheme , as is affordable using lattice qcd matrix elements .",
    "one could also use scheme independent coefficients , but this would correspond to what we have called an `` unbalanced '' definition of the initial conditions @xmath48 , i.e. to an additional dependence of @xmath52 on the external states , to be compensated by using matrix elements calculated between the same external states .",
    "using the @xmath7 effective hamiltonian we have computed , we can calculate the nlo amplitudes for kaon decays into two pions : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , whose imaginary parts enter the expression for @xmath55 : ^&=&[epsilonprime ] where @xmath56 and : a _ 2=(a _ 2)^+_iba _ 0 @xmath57 denotes the isospin breaking contribution and we assume @xmath58 .    @xmath59 and @xmath60 are expressed in terms of wilson coefficients and operator matrix elements .",
    "we have implemented a numerical program for the calculation of the evolution of the wilson coefficients at nlo and we have taken the matrix elements of the operators in eq.([opbasis ] ) from lattice qcd .",
    "we have chosen as matching scale @xmath61 gev , because at this scale the wilson coefficients can be safely computed in a pure perturbative regime and operator matrix elements , when calculable , can be taken from lattice qcd ( this would not be true for other non - perturbative methods , a much lower scale @xmath8 would be required , @xmath62 gev , where the wilson coefficients show a quite strong instability ",
    "see fig.([ncf68 ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , the matrix element of the generic operator @xmath63 is given by : o_i = b_io_i_via where the subscript `` @xmath64 '' denotes the matrix element calculated in the vacuum insertion approximation and @xmath65 is the b - parameter of the operator @xmath63 , which quantitatively represents the deviation of the physical matrix element from the via expectation .",
    "the via matrix elements are calculated as functions of three quantities : x&=&f_(m _",
    "k^ 2-m_^ 2 ) + y&=&f_()^2 + & ~ & 12x()^2 + z&=&4(-1)y [ xyz ] while the b - parameters are in part taken from lattice qcd ( with a given error ) and , when this is not possible , they are allowed to vary in a suitable range , consistent with some theoretical predictions or experimental results .",
    "thus , in the effective hamiltonian formalism the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath66 result to be : [ ima0 ] & & a _ 0 = -im ( v _ ts^ * v _ td ) + & & \\{-(c _ 6b _ 6+c _ 5b _",

    "9^ 3/2 }    as one can see from eqs.(17 ) and ( 18 ) , @xmath1 depends on the analytical calculation of the coefficients ( as functions of the scale @xmath8 , the top mass @xmath4 and @xmath9 ) and on some experimental and theoretical input parameters , in particular : the b - parameters , the strange quark mass @xmath67 , the ckm matrix elements .",
    "many other well known quantities enter the determination of @xmath1 , but they are clearly not so relevant in the analysis of the uncertainties which still affect our theoretical analysis .",
    "i would like to separate two main arguments .",
    "the first one concerns the discussion of @xmath1 in the more general contest in which we can understand the mechanism of cp violation in the standard model ( or even beyond it ) .",
    "the second one , on the other hand , is more specifically related to the determination of @xmath1 itself , on the basis of the nlo calculation of the wilson coefficients @xcite .    in a global analysis of cp - violation within the standard model framework ,",
    "other physical quantities have to be taken into account , mainly : the @xmath68 parameter of cp violation in the @xmath69 mixing and the @xmath70 parameter of @xmath71 mixing ( related to @xmath72 or to the @xmath73 b - parameter ) . @xmath68 and @xmath70 , as @xmath1 depend on some ckm matrix elements and moreover introduce a strong dependence on @xmath74 ( the b - parameter for the @xmath75 mixing ) and on the b - meson lifetime @xmath76 .",
    "many phenomenological analysis of this kind exists in the literature , f.i .",
    "we are presently updating the analysis of ref.@xcite , both with respect to the values of the parameters used and to the use of the nlo expression for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the main idea of ref.@xcite is to use the common dependence of @xmath68 , @xmath70 and @xmath1 on @xmath77 ( @xmath78 being the cp - violating phase in the ckm matrix ) in order to select between positive and negative values of @xmath79 . for a fixed value of @xmath80",
    "( we have taken @xmath81 gev ) the theoretical value of @xmath68  obtained allowing @xmath74 , @xmath9 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( in the wolfestein parametrization of the ckm matrix , see f.i .",
    "@xcite ) varying in a @xmath84-interval around their central values  is fitted with the experimental one ( @xmath85 ) . for the selected values of @xmath77 , @xmath72 and @xmath1",
    "are calculated ( we assume @xmath86 and this time we vary also @xmath76 , @xmath87 , @xmath67 and the b - parameters with the previous criterion ) and from the knowledge of both of them a single region , @xmath88 or @xmath89 should be selected . indeed the present proposed values for @xmath72 : f_b=\\ { ( 20540 ) & + ( 1951030 ) & + ( 1606 + 53 + -19 ) & . seem to select quite unambiguously the @xmath88 region . on the other and , as we will discuss more extensively in the following , this is not the case for @xmath1 , at the present level of theoretical and experimental uncertainty , see figs.([mt130])-([mt190 ] ) .",
    "let us add a few comments on the values used for some relevant parameters .",
    "we use @xmath90 mev , derived from @xcite where the value for @xmath91 is given .",
    "we assume @xmath92 mev , lower than in ref.@xcite , in order to better compare our results to other recent analyses @xcite , also if we still think that the status of uncertainty on @xmath67 is such that the our `` old '' @xmath93 mev would have been reasonably allowed .    concerning the ckm matrix elements , the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( wolfestein par .",
    ") are derived respectively from @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the value of @xmath94 used is : v_cb= a^2= 0.0430.005 as extracted from incluse and exclusive semipletonic b - decays data using a b - meson mean lifetime of : _",
    "b= ( 1.50.1)10 ^ -12 it is in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite and corresponds to : a=(0.90.1 ) the recent data presented at this conference @xcite , propose a little lower value of @xmath94 ( @xmath96 , corresponding to @xmath97 ) and correspondentely a still higher value for the b - meson mean lifetime @xmath76",
    "( @xmath98 ps )",
    ". finally , our choice of @xmath95 :    between the analysis of the inclusive semileptonic b - spectrum based on the accmm or isgw models @xcite . on the other hand , for the extimation of the error we trust much more the accmm model .",
    "the corrisponding value of @xmath83 results to be : = 0.390.07 a much more detailed discussion will be given in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us now consider the nlo analysis of @xmath1 .",
    "the new values assumed for the ckm parameters have clearly produced a change in the central value of @xmath1 ( at different @xmath80 ) with respect to ref.@xcite .",
    "the same holds also for the change in @xmath67 . for the time being we have not yet ultimate the analysis of the specific dependence on these parameters",
    "@xcite , but it will be clearly important to have it in view of a more general discussion ( see previous argument ) .",
    "then , @xmath1 mainly depends on the values of the b - parameters and on the nlo expression for the wilson coefficients .",
    "the b - parameters are certainly one of the major sources of uncertainty in the problem , being related to the poor knowledge we still have of the long - distance hadronic physics .",
    "a detailed discussion of the values used , see table [ bpar ] , is given in refs.@xcite .",

    "indeed , at lo , @xmath1 results to be dominated by @xmath111 , and we want to verify if it is still the case at nlo , when electromagnetic penguin operators are expected to play a very important role . the leading @xmath112 s result always to be : @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "first , let us fix @xmath116 gev , @xmath61 gev , @xmath117 mev , and look at the effects of the nlo evolution ( qcd+qed ) .",
    "the only relevant variations appear for @xmath118 : @xmath119 varies from 0.40 ( lo ) to 0.66 ( nlo ) and @xmath120 from -0.02 ( lo ) to -0.09 ( nlo )",
    ". however , the sum @xmath121 does not change in a sensible way from lo to nlo ( from 0.20 to 0.30 ) , while the sum @xmath122 is constant and equal to 0.10 .",
    "thus , although the contribution of each single electromagnetic penguin operator is relevant , their global effect is not and @xmath1 continues to be dominated by the contribution of @xmath111 still at nlo level .",
    "being @xmath123 lowered by the nlo corrections here considered ( see fig.([ncf6 ] ) ) , also the central value of @xmath1 is lowered going from lo to nlo , as figs.([mt130])-([mt160 ] ) show .",
    "the value measured by the fermilab collaboration at e731 @xcite seems to be in better agreement with our results .",
    "= 2.7 in    = 2.7 in    taking now the nlo values for the @xmath124 and looking to specific dependences , we observe first of all a remarkable variation with @xmath80 , see again figs.([mt130])-([mt160 ] ) .",
    "higher values of @xmath80 correspond to lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "the present `` tendence '' of @xmath80 seems to point towards higher values instead then smaller ones and this is another point in favour of a small value of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , looking at fig.([ncf68 ] ) , we can see both the dependence on @xmath9 and the dependence on @xmath8 for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "what is quite clear here is just the fact ( already stressed in justifying the necessity of a high matching scale for the effective hamiltonian ) that the coefficients really `` blow up '' for low values of @xmath8 , let us say below 1 gev , indicating that the perturbative approach is nomore reliable at that scale .",
    "from the previous phenomenological analysis , it is clear that for the time being the value of @xmath1 is till compatible with zero and nothing definitive can be stated neither experimentally nor theoretically .",
    "thus , the standar model prediction of a small but definitely non - zero @xmath1 could still be confirmed or not .",
    "the experimental scenario seems at the moment to be much more promising @xcite than the theoretical one .",
    "what we have done put the calculation of the perturbative part of the @xmath7 effective hamiltonian on a more solid ground , while some sensible improvements in the calculation of the long - distance physics of the problem is mandatory .",
