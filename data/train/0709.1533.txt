    "the system of two evanescently coupled @xmath0 processes operating in the second harmonic generation ( shg ) regime inside a pumped fabry - perot cavity has been theoretically analysed by bache  @xcite , in terms of suppression of number difference fluctuations between the output modes . in this work",
    "the name quantum optical dimer was given to this device .",
    "although the calculations performed by bache were sufficient to show that strong intensity correlations should exist between the outputs , they did not calculate any of the phase - dependent correlations which are necessary to demonstrate the existence of continuous variable bipartite quantum entanglement . in later works , olsen and drummond  @xcite and olivier and olsen  @xcite have shown theoretically that a related device , operating in the downconversion regime of optical parametric oscillation , can provide a robust source of continuous variable entanglement and be used to demonstrate the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox in both the above and below threshold regimes . in this work",
    "we will examine the quantum optical dimer proposal of bache in terms of the production of entanglement and epr states . in principle",
    "this sytem may have all the operational advantages of the coupled downconverter proposals , along with the property that all output modes are always macroscopically excited in second harmonic generation since there is no oscillation threshold .",
    "generally , the device we are proposing may be considered as either a single nonlinear crystal pumped by two spatially separated lasers , or two waveguides with a @xmath0 component .",
    "we calculate phase - dependent correlations between the outputs of the cavity , evaluating entanglement criteria due to duan  @xcite , simon  @xcite , the lograithmic negativity  @xcite , as well as the reid - drummond epr correlations  @xcite which can also be used to prove entanglement .",
    "generically , our system is related to the nonlinear coupler , which is the name given to a system of two coupled waveguides without an optical cavity by perina  @xcite .",
    "the device generally consists of two parallel optical waveguides which are coupled by an evanescent overlap of the guided modes .",
    "the quantum statistical properties of this device when the nonlinearity is of the @xmath1 type have been theoretically investigated , predicting energy transfer between the waveguides  @xcite and the generation of correlated squeezing  @xcite . when operated inside an optical cavity , entanglement between the output modes",
    "has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the system with @xmath0 nonlinearity , and operating in the upconversion regime , is also potentially an easily tunable source of single - mode squeezing and entangled states for both the low frequency fundamental modes and the high frequency up - converted harmonic modes .",
    "the spatial separation of the output modes means that they do not have to be separated by optical devices before measurements can be made , along with the unavoidable losses which would result from this procedure .",
    "we will show that the correlations are tunable by controlling some of the operational degrees of freedom of the system , including the evanescent couplings between the two waveguides , the cavity damping rates , the input powers and the cavity detunings .",
    "before we begin to analyse the actual physical system , we will define and outline the measures which we will use below to demonstrate continuous - variable bipartite entanglement .",
    "entanglement is a property of quantum mechanics which is related to the inseparability of the combined density matrix of a system into density matrices for its subsystems . in the present situation",
    ", we will be interested interested in continuous variable bipartite entanglement between the output modes from each side of the dimer , which we shall label as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is firstly necessary to give the definition of the optical quadratures we will use , as the exact form of any inequalities depends on this . for the description of this system , we require four intracavity bosonic annihilation operators , @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 are for the low frequency ( fundamental ) modes and the @xmath6 are for the high frequency ( harmonic ) modes .",
    "we define the quadrature operators at the phase angle @xmath7 as @xmath8 so that @xmath9=2i\\delta_{jk}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the kronecker delta , and similarly for the high frequency quadratures .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) then requires @xmath11 . in the interests of notational simplicity",
    ", we will label the quadrature @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the epr paradox stems from a famous paper published in @xmath14  @xcite , which used a gedanken experiment with particles which were entangled in position and momentum to show that local realism was not consistent with the completeness of quantum mechanical theory . a direct and feasible demonstration of the epr paradox with continuous variables",
    "was first suggested using nondegenerate parametric amplification  @xcite .",
    "this was possible because the optical quadrature phase amplitudes used in these proposals have the same mathematical properties as the position and momentum originally used by epr .",
    "even though the correlations between these are not perfect , they are still entangled sufficiently to allow for an inferred violation of the uncertainty principle , which is equivalent to the epr paradox  @xcite .",
    "an experimental demonstration of this proposal by ou soon followed , showing a clear agreement with quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical proposal has examined a demonstration with the atomic field quadratures of massive particles , using the coherent dissociation of molecular bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .    although the concept of entanglement is required to formulate the epr paradox , for completeness we will outline the details of a proof given by reid  @xcite that seeming violations of a heisenberg uncertainty principal ( hup ) as in the experiment of ou  @xcite are automatically demonstrations of entanglement .",
    "we begin by assuming that a given system is bipartite separable and divide it into two subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we now consider observables @xmath17 and @xmath18 of subsystem @xmath15 , obeying the heisenberg uncertainty principal with @xmath19 .",
    "we now introduce @xmath20 as the measured error in the prediction for the outcome of a measurement @xmath17 at @xmath15 , based on a result at @xmath16 , and similarly for @xmath21 .",
    "the first task is to show that separability always demands @xmath22 , so that violation of this inequality requires inseparability and hence entanglement of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the conditional probability of result @xmath23 for a measurement of @xmath17 at @xmath15 given a simultaneous measurement of @xmath24 at @xmath16 with result @xmath25 is @xmath26 where , assuming separability @xmath27 with a separable density matrix being written as @xmath28 in this case , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are eigenstates of @xmath17 and @xmath24 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the mean of this conditional distribution is @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the variance , @xmath35 , of the distribution @xmath36 is then @xmath37 for each @xmath38 , the mean square deviation , @xmath39 , is minimised by the choice @xmath40 , so that for the choice @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the variance of @xmath44 .",
    "we may also define a measured error , @xmath45 , resulting from linear inference , which will not be better than that based on knowledge of the conditional probabilities , so that @xmath46 we also note that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the eigenstate of @xmath18 .",
    "the cauchy - schwartz inequality then implies that @xmath50 for any physical @xmath51 , the hup requires that @xmath52 .",
    "for a separable state it is therefore required that @xmath53 as the measured errors are always at least as large as the inferred errors , this means that an observation of @xmath54 is sufficient to prove inseparability and hence bipartite entanglement .",
    "we note that this violation is a sufficient but not a necessary condition , so that continuous variable bipartite entanglement may be present which is not detected by this means .",
    "an example of such a situation , which can occur for mixed states , is given by bowen  @xcite .",
    "we also note here that the epr paradox signifies a stronger form of entanglement , as has been discussed recently by wiseman in the context of steering  @xcite .    in practice",
    "any epr measurement is usually done by defining orthogonal quadratures via a minimisation of the errors in a linear inference process  @xcite .",
    "the apparent violation of the hup for these quadratures then signals entanglement between the modes of the system .",
    "we note here that it has also been shown by tan  @xcite that the existence of two orthogonal quadratures , the product of whose variances violates the limits set by the hup , provides evidence of entanglement .",
    "tan demonstrated this in the context of teleportation , with the outputs from a nondegenerate opa mixed on a beamsplitter .",
    "this procedure has been extended to the case of tripartite entanglement  @xcite and its extension to larger numbers of modes is straightforward , even though the number of inequalities to be violated increases due to the different classes of inseparability which then exist  @xcite .",
    "the second of the entanglement measures is due to duan  @xcite and also simon  @xcite , who developed inseparability criteria which are necessary and sufficient for gaussian states , and sufficient in general .",
    "these criteria have recently been shown to be special cases of an infinite series of inequalities based on the non - negativity of determinants of matrices constructed from certain combinations of operator moments  @xcite . in the general case",
    ", we may define combined quadrature operators similarly to duan as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an arbitrary non - zero real number .",
    "it may be shown that , for separable states , @xmath57 with any violation of this inequality therefore demonstrating the presence of bipartite entanglement . in what follows , we will choose @xmath58 so that the lower bound of the inequality is @xmath59 . while this is not the optimal choice for the general case",
    ", it is the appropriate choice for this system , due to the symmetry between modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the third measure which we will apply is the logarithmic negativity , proposed by vidal and werner as a computable measure of entanglement , as opposed to others which can be difficult to calculate  @xcite . we note here that this measure is defined for gaussian states , to which we are also limited here due to the linearisation process which we will be using .",
    "we first define the system covariance matrix as @xmath60 , \\label{eq : covmat}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , \\label{eq : jcovmat}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 .",
    "\\label{eq : ijcovmat}\\ ] ] defining @xmath63 the logarithmic negativity is then defined as @xmath64 any non - zero value of @xmath65 is then an indication that the two modes are entangled .",
    "an interesting feature of this measure is that it has no dependence on quadrature angle , but becomes a function of frequency only .",
    "this shows that the logarithmic negativity is useful for demonstrating that continuous variable entanglement exists in a given system , but does not tell us at which quadrature angles the system may exhibit the necessary properties for uses such as teleportation .",
    "the physical device we wish to examine is the same as that described in reference @xcite .",
    "as this device has been described there in detail , we will give a briefer description of the essential features here .",
    "the system consists of two coupled nonlinear @xmath0 waveguides inside a driven optical cavity , which may utilise integrated bragg reflection for compactness .",
    "each waveguide supports two resonant or near resonant modes at frequencies @xmath66 ( fundamental ) and @xmath67 ( harmonic ) , where @xmath68 .",
    "the lower frequency modes at @xmath66 are driven coherently with external laser fields , while the nonlinear interaction within the waveguides produces second harmonic photons with frequency @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that only the cavity modes at these two frequencies are important and that there is perfect phase matching inside the media .",
    "the two waveguides are evanescently coupled",
    ". we will be interested in the phase - dependent correlations necessary for an unambiguous demonstration of entanglement and the epr paradox , rather than intensity correlations considered in reference @xcite .",

    "as described in reference @xcite , where it is stated that the lower frequency coupling , @xmath77 , is generally stronger than the higher frequency coupling , @xmath78 , and also that values of @xmath77 as high as @xmath79 times the lower frequency cavity loss rate may be physically reasonable .",

    "finally , the cavity damping is described by @xmath82 where the @xmath83 represent bath operators at the two frequencies and we have made the usual zero temperature and markov approximations for the reservoirs .    with the standard methods",
    "@xcite , and using the operator / c - number correspondences @xmath84 , the hamiltonian can be mapped onto a fokker - planck equation for the glauber - sudarshan p - distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , as the diffusion matrix of this fokker - planck equation is not positive - definite , it can not be mapped onto a set of stochastic differential equations .",
    "hence we will use the positive - p representation  @xcite which , by doubling the dimensionality of the phase - space , allows a fokker - planck equation with a positive - definite diffusion matrix to be found and thus a mapping onto stochastic differential equations . making the correspondence between the set of operators @xmath85 @xmath86 and the set of c - number variables @xmath87 , we find the following set of equations , @xmath88 where the @xmath89 represent the cavity damping rates at each frequency . we have also added cavity detunings @xmath90 from the two resonances , so that for a pump laser at frequency @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "below , in section  [ sec : detune ] , we will investigate detuning effects in greater detail .",
    "the real gaussian noise terms have the correlations @xmath94 and @xmath95 . note that , due to the independence of the noise sources , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are not complex conjugate pairs , except in the mean over a large number of stochastic integrations of the above equations .",
    "these equations allow us to calculate the expectation values of any desired time - normally ordered operator moments as classical averages , exactly as required to calculate spectral correlations .",

    "it is also apparent that they give their best results at different quadrature angles to the duan and simon criteria .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is perhaps the most sensitive indicator of inseparability for this system , although it does not tell us the quadrature angle at which maximum violations of the other inequalities can be found . in , we see , for example , that it is much more sensitive at finding entanglement between the fundamental modes than the other two methods in the case where @xmath110 .",
    "we note here that the duan and simon criteria showed very little violation of the inequality in this case , but we have shown only the quadrature angle of maximum violation . the frequency range over which the logarithmic negativity is positive",
    "tells us that violations can be found for other quadrature angles as the frequency changes , although given the fact that the maximum violation of the duan and simon inequality is very small here , it is unlikely that this particular combination of parameters would be a good operational choice .",

    "we have analysed the system of intracavity evanescently coupled second harmonic generation in terms of phase sensitive correlations which give evidence of continuous variable entanglement between different modes of the optical field .",
    "we have shown how matching the cavity detunings to the evanescent coupling rates fixes the quadrature angles for which the best violations of the inequalities occur .",
    "we see that below the self - pulsing threshold , the system exhibits a wide range of behaviour depending on the relative strengths of the pumps , the cavity loss rates , the detunings and the evanescent couplings . as all of these",
    "are experimentally tuneable , the device may be of use for applications which require varying degrees of entanglement to be available at different intensities , different frequencies and different quadrature phase angles .",
    "the entangled beams exit the cavity at different spatial locations and do not have to be separated before measurements can be made .",
    "as the system also produces single mode squeezing and can be built using integrated optics , it may prove to be more robust and useful than devices which rely on the relative stability and positioning of individual optical components .",
    "finally , the fact that the entanglement is present with reasonably intense fields may prove to be a real advantage over devices based on nondegenerate downconversion , which experience phase diffusion in the region where the fields develop macroscopic intensities ."
