    "we propose here a conjecture ( conjecture  [ theconjecture ] below ) refining the stark conjecture @xmath2 ( tate s formulation @xcite ) in the function field case , and we verify our conjecture in the genus zero case .",
    "of course @xmath2 in the function field case is a theorem due to deligne @xcite and independently to hayes @xcite .",
    "the main novelty of our conjecture is that it involves _",
    "two- _ rather than one - variable algebraic functions .",
    "the conjecture is formulated in the powerful language and framework of tate s thesis .",
    "ultimately this paper is inspired by remarkable examples of coleman @xcite and thakur @xcite . to motivate the paper we devote most of this introduction to the discussion of an example similar to the ones originally considered by coleman and by thakur .",
    "we first discuss the example in `` raw form '' and then we explain how to look at it from the adelic point of view cultivated in this paper .",
    "consider the smooth projective model @xmath3 of the affine plane curve @xmath4 over @xmath5 . on the surface @xmath6 ( product formed over @xmath5 )",
    "consider the meromorphic function @xmath7 following the lead of coleman , it can easily be verified that @xmath8 by the theory of correspondences on curves it follows that the analogously formed sum of endomorphisms of the jacobian of @xmath9 vanishes .",
    "thus we reprove following coleman  by a strikingly elementary argument  that the `` universal gauss sum '' @xmath10\\ ] ] acts on the jacobian of @xmath9 in the same way as does the @xmath11 power frobenius endomorphism .",
    "now view @xmath9 as a covering of the @xmath12-line over @xmath5 by setting @xmath13 still following coleman , notice that by specializing the second variable to @xmath14 in the example @xmath15 , we obtain a `` stark - like '' function in the extension @xmath16 .",
    "we say `` stark - like '' because the functions arising this way do not have precisely the right properties to qualify as stark units in the sense of @xmath2 ; nonetheless , these functions would appear to be promising `` raw material '' for building stark units since their divisors and galois properties are evident .",
    "what is yet more intriguing is that this approach gives insight into the variation of the stark unit as we vary the choice of completely split place .",
    "it is coleman s brilliant idea to link two - variable algebraic functions to stark s conjecture in this way .",
    "we turn to follow thakur s lead .",
    "we have @xmath17\\\\ \\deg a < n \\end{subarray } } \\frac{a+\\beta t^n+t^{n+1}+\\alpha / t}{a+t^n},\\ ] ] for all @xmath18 , @xmath19 and integers @xmath20 , as can be verified by manipulating moore determinants . by definition ,",
    "the left side of the equation is the pull - back of @xmath15 via the map @xmath21 the system of identities ( [ equation : thakurinterpolation ] ) uniquely characterizes our example @xmath15 , and illustrates an extremely valuable heuristic which we credit to thakur , namely : `` frobenius interpolation formulas '' with `` @xmath22-partial - products '' on the right side automatically have `` functions of coleman type '' on the left side .",
    "we pause to remark that a fairly extensive body of theory and applications of phenomena of coleman / thakur type has already been developed .",
    "for example , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; the applications to transcendence theory have been particularly notable . for a survey with a wealth of examples , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chaps .  4 and 8) .",
    "while the main emphasis in the theory to this point has been on the case of the basefield @xmath23 , significant efforts to generalize the base have been made ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "but a general framework for understanding and classifying all these examples has been lacking .",
    "the main point of this paper is to rebuild the theory on the foundation of tate s thesis so that a clear ( albeit conjectural ) picture of the situation over a general basefield emerges .",
    "we return to the analysis of our example @xmath15 .",
    "we explain how to look at the example from the point of view peculiar to this paper .",
    "put @xmath24 the group @xmath25 is a copy of @xmath26 and in particular is abelian . notice that @xmath15 is invariant under the diagonal action @xmath27 of @xmath25 on @xmath28 .",
    "the example @xmath15 lives in a setting with somewhat subtle commutative algebra properties .",
    "notice that ( i ) the ring extension @xmath29 is a finite etale extension of dedekind domains , ( ii ) the diagonal prime @xmath30 lies above the diagonal prime @xmath31 and ( iii ) the prime of the diagonally @xmath25-invariant subring of @xmath28 below @xmath32 has the same residue field as @xmath33 , namely @xmath34 .",
    "the upshot is that the diagonal completion of @xmath35 coincides with the diagonal completion of the diagonally @xmath25-invariant subring of @xmath28 .",
    "we now simply identify the latter with the former . under this identification the strange - looking formula @xmath36 makes sense .",
    "now let s put global class field theory into the picture .",
    "let @xmath37 be the adele ring of @xmath34 and for each idele @xmath38 , let @xmath39 be the corresponding idele norm .",
    "let @xmath40 be the reciprocity law homomorphism of global class field theory , redefined the modern way , as in tate s article @xcite , so that uniformizers map to geometric frobenius elements and hence , for all @xmath41 algebraic over @xmath5 and @xmath38 , we have @xmath42 .",
    "( we follow this rule throughout the paper . )",
    "we make @xmath43 act on the perfect ring @xmath44{k}\\otimes_{{{\\mathbb{f}}}_q}\\sqrt[q^\\infty]{k}$ ] by the rule @xmath45 which makes sense since @xmath46{k}/ \\sqrt[q^\\infty]{k})$ ] . since the @xmath43-action defined above commutes with the diagonal action of @xmath25",
    ", we may naturally view all the functions @xmath47 as elements of the perfection of the diagonal completion of @xmath35 .",
    "we need a few more definitions before getting to the `` punchline '' .",
    "let @xmath48 be the normalized additive valuation of @xmath35 giving the order of vanishing at the diagonal ideal , and let this additive valuation be extended to the perfection of the completion in evident fashion .",
    "let @xmath49 be the maximal compact subring .",
    "let @xmath50 be the unique place of @xmath34 at which @xmath12 has a pole .",
    "let @xmath51 be the idele whose component at @xmath50 is @xmath52 and whose components elsewhere are @xmath53 . consider the @xmath54-valued schwartz function @xmath55 on @xmath37 , where @xmath56 is probabilist s notation for the function taking the value @xmath53 on the set @xmath1 and @xmath57 elsewhere .",
    "we now get to the heart of the matter .",
    "the divisor formula ( [ equation : colemandivisor ] ) can be rewritten as the formula @xmath58 holding for all @xmath38 , plus a further assertion to the effect that no primes of the dedekind domain @xmath28 other than those of the form @xmath59{k}\\right)\\;\\;\\;(a\\in { { \\mathbb{a}}}^\\times)\\ ] ] enter into the prime factorization of @xmath15 in @xmath28 . the interpolation formula ( [ equation : thakurinterpolation ] ) can be rewritten as the formula @xmath60 holding for all @xmath38 such that @xmath61 .",
    "formulas  ( [ equation : approximateconjecture1 ] ) and ( [ equation : approximateconjecture2 ] ) very strongly suggest that there s more to the coleman / thakur phenomenon than just a few isolated examples .",
    "we now draw our discussion of the example @xmath15 to a close .",
    "we turn to the task of describing our conjecture , in order at least to convey some its flavor .",
    "we continue with similar notation .",
    "let @xmath34 be any global field with constant field @xmath5 , let @xmath37 be the adele ring of @xmath34 , and let @xmath62 be the reciprocity law homomorphism of global class field theory .",
    "we define a _ coleman unit _ to be an element of the fraction field of the `` big ring '' @xmath44{k^{{\\mathrm{ab}}}}\\otimes_{{{\\mathbb{f}}}_q^{{\\mathrm{ab}}}}\\sqrt[q^\\infty]{k^{{\\mathrm{ab}}}}$ ] which is ( i ) invariant under the diagonal action @xmath63 of @xmath64 and ( ii ) a unit at every maximal ideal of the big ring not transformable under the action @xmath65 of @xmath43 to the diagonal ideal @xmath66 .",
    "our conjecture associates to every @xmath67$]-valued schwartz - function @xmath68 on @xmath37 such that @xmath69 a coleman unit @xmath15 for which analogues of ( [ equation : approximateconjecture1 ] ) and ( [ equation : approximateconjecture2 ] ) hold , the latter in a more general formulation ( not subject to any restriction on @xmath70 ) relating the `` leading taylor coefficient '' to a gadget we call the _ catalan symbol_. the values of the catalan symbol are function field elements roughly analogous in structure to the catalan numbers @xmath71 .",
    "the catalan symbol is defined in terms of a further gadget we call the _ rational fourier transform_. the characteristic feature of the theory of rational fourier transforms is that the function @xmath72 is assigned the role usually played by a nonconstant complex - valued character of @xmath5 .    as mentioned above , we prove our conjecture in genus zero .",
    "we believe that ideas from the author s papers @xcite and @xcite suitably combined have a fighting chance to prove our conjecture in general .",
    "perhaps the rather different set of ideas from @xcite could also yield a proof .",
    "we hope for a proof of the conjecture in the general case not so heavily computational as the proof we give here in the genus zero case .    to make the point that our conjecture refines @xmath2 , we provide a deduction of the latter from the former in  [ section : starkrecovery ] below .",
    "in fact a large fraction of the paper is devoted to developing the machinery needed to make the deduction of @xmath2 from our conjecture run smoothly .",
    "in particular , the technical tool we call the _",
    "adelic stirling formula _",
    "( theorem  [ theorem : adelicstirling ] below ) is crucial for proving our `` recipe '' ( theorem  [ theorem : recipe ] below ) for the stark unit conditional on our conjecture .",
    "we conclude the introduction by remarking on the organization of the paper . since we have provided a table of contents , we need nt make comments section - by - section .",
    "we just offer the following advice . after glancing at  [ subsection : generalnotation ] to be apprised of general notation and terminology ,",
    "the reader could very well start in  [ section : globalstirling ] , because that s where the main story - line of the paper begins ; the preceding sections , which are more or less independent of each other , could be treated as references .",
    "but on the other hand , if the reader would take the trouble to work patiently through the sections before  [ section : globalstirling ] , he / she would be prepared to hear the main story undistracted by technical issues of an essentially nonarithmetical nature .",
