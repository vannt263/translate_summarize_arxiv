    "the ngc  7538  ( s158 ) molecular cloud , located in the perseus arm at a distance of 2.8 kpc @xcite , contains many protostellar objects , making it a good candidate to study different stages of star formation .",
    "furthermore , there seems to be a progression in evolution from northwest ( the visible h  ii region , ngc  7538 , and irs  2 , an only moderately obscured compact hii region ) to southeast ( irs 9 , a deeply embedded core ) @xcite .",
    "the near- and mid - infrared  sources irs  1 , 2 , and 3 all lie near the northwest end of the star - forming region . of these , irs  1  is the brightest mid - infrared  and radio continuum source @xcite .",

    "the absorption traces warm gas with a high column density of nh@xmath3  and is centered near @xmath10  . the emission , on the other hand ,",
    "is centered near @xmath11  .",
    "the systemic velocity for this source is @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite mapped nh@xmath3  emission from a more extended region in ngc  7538 .",
    "this emission probably probes the outer envelope as indicated by the colder temperature and the smaller column density . using both single - dish and interferometer observations of various molecular tracers ,",
    "@xcite studied the density and temperature structure of both the cold outer envelope and the warm inner material ( 24072000 au ) .",
    "the inner warm region is characterized by temperatures of a few hundred k.    outflows are often present toward protostars , and ngc  7538  irs  1  is no exception .",
    "@xcite observed irs  1  with the vla at 5 and 15 ghz .",
    "she found a pair of very compact lobes of continuum radiation , separated in declination by 0.2 , with emission extending out to @xmath132 .",
    "her preferred model involves a bipolar ionized outflow from a late o star , collimated by a core of dense gas extending from @xmath1465  au to @xmath1525,000  au .",
    "further evidence of outflows was found when @xcite observed irs  1  with the vla in the h66@xmath16 line and the 22 ghz continuum .",
    "their continuum image is similar to that of campbell , but shows additional structure .",
    "they found broad recombination line emission in the two lobes , with a minimum line - to - continuum ratio , which they attribute to high electron density , between the lobes .",
    "they propose a model involving a high velocity stellar wind interacting with photo - evaporating knots of neutral gas .",
    "more recently , @xcite have modeled the radio continuum observations of irs  1  as due to a wind produced by photo - evaporation of a circumstellar disk with a radius of 500 au exposed to uv radiation from the central o star .",

    "a second cluster of masers , 0.25  to the south , is at 61.0 .",
    "the disk masers lie along a line centered near the gap between the lobes of the free - free continuum radiation , although they are aligned along a position angle @xmath930  from the symmetry plane .",
    "@xcite made a detailed model of maser emission from a disk around irs  1 , supporting the suggestion of @xcite they concluded that the maser emission comes from disk radii of @xmath17  au .",
    "however , more recently , @xcite show that the ch@xmath3oh  masers may trace knots in the outflow instead .",

    "previous infrared studies suffered from limited spectral resolution .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] describes the observations .",
    "we then present the model used to derive the column densities and temperatures for the various species in section [ sec : fit ] and describe the results for each of the molecules in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec : mod ] , we discuss the possible scenario in which we are probing chemistry in a circumstellar disk .",
    "in section [ sec : conc ] , we provide some concluding remarks .",
    "the observations were made with texes , the texas echelon cross echelle spectrograph @xcite , on the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) in 2001 june and november , 2002 september and december , and 2005 december .",
    "texes is a high - resolution cross - dispersed spectrograph operating at mid - infrared  wavelengths between 5 and 25  @xmath18 m .",
    "it achieves a spectral resolution of @xmath30 = 75,000 - 100,000 ( @xmath31  ) shortward of 14  @xmath18 m  with a slit width of @xmath91.5  .",
    "( of the observations presented here , only the spectra near 11  @xmath18 m , which used a 1  slit , achieved the higher resolution . ) the spatial resolution along the north - south oriented slit is @xmath91 , slightly larger than the diffraction limit of the irtf .",
    "the spectral and spatial sampling by the @xmath32 pixel si : as detector array are 1.0  and 0.35 , respectively . at each spectral setting , 5 - 10 orders of the high resolution echelon grating are recorded , giving a spectral coverage of @xmath330.5% . at wavelengths",
    "shortward of 11  @xmath18 m  full order widths are observed , giving continuous spectral coverage , but longward of 11  @xmath18 m  the order width exceeds the array width , leaving gaps in the observed spectra . the location of the gaps can be shifted in order to optimize line coverage .",
    "however , since the gaps are small and , at 13 , there are many telluric lines , it would be impractical to repeat observations with small shifts in order to get complete spectral coverage for each setting .",
    "much of the data were taken in high water vapor conditions , but the observing conditions did not seriously affect the spectra except for increased noise , especially on atmospheric lines .",
    "observations of ngc  7538  irs  1  were interspersed with observations of a bright asteroid ( usually ceres ( @xmath34 jy ) , but also hygeia ( @xmath35 jy ) , which served as a comparison source for removal of telluric absorption features . the telescope was nodded by 35 , moving the source along the spectrograph entrance slit to allow subtraction of background emission . at the beginning of each set of nodded observations an ambient temperature blackbody was observed for flat - fielding .",
    "the first nods were used to peak up on the source by maximizing the throughput of the slit .",
    "the nod pairs taken during peak up were not included in the final sum .",
    "data reduction followed the standard texes procedure @xcite of first subtracting the two nod position spectra , flat - fielding with the blackbody - sky difference echellogram @xcite , and interpolating over spikes and bad pixels .",
    "optimally - weighted point - source spectra were then extracted from the echellograms .",
    "the spectra were linearized in ln@xmath36 based on the known optical distortions , and absolute wavenumber calibration was obtained from telluric emission features and corrected for the earth s motion relative to lsr .",
    "the resulting wavenumber scale is correct to within 1  .",
    "the same procedure was used for the asteroid spectra , and then the irs  1  spectra were divided by the asteroid spectra with correction for differences in airmass . with this procedure ,",
    "telluric absorption lines as deep as 90% can be removed , although of course the noise increases on lines .",
    "however , broad response variations often remained , which were removed by fitting the continuum in each echelon order to a quartic polynomial and dividing .",
    "this procedure also sets the continuum in each order to one .",
    "ten spectral settings were observed in the 728820  @xmath37(13.712.2  @xmath18 m ) region , two in the 860930 @xmath37  ( 11.510.7  @xmath18 m ) region ( see figure [ fig : twelveum ] ) , and three in the 12401312  @xmath37  ( 8.07.6  @xmath18 m ) region ( see figure [ fig : eightum ] ) .",
    "a total of 110 echelon orders , or @xmath970 @xmath37 , were observed .",
    "the original observations were meant to study the line profiles of c@xmath0h@xmath0  and hcn , which had previously been detected .",
    "in addition to the prominent fundamental band lines of c@xmath0h@xmath0  and hcn , many c@xmath0h@xmath0  hot band lines were detected in our spectra including lines from the @xmath38  +  @xmath23  ",

    "many lines were detected , though none corresponded to c@xmath0h@xmath39 .",
    "some were due to nh@xmath3 , but many lines remained unidentified ( see figures [ fig : hncoall ] and [ fig : hncoblowup ] ) . based on their separation we were able to identify the lines as due to hnco .",
    "interstellar hnco is a well known hot core molecule at radio wavelengths @xcite , but it had never been seen at infrared wavelengths . in total ,",

    "to derive physical parameters of the absorbing gas , model spectra were fitted to the observations . for this purpose ,",
    "the data were divided into two groups .",
    "all data at wavenumbers between 700 and 1000 @xmath37  ( 10.713.7 ) were fitted simultaneously , and data at 12401280 @xmath37  ( near 8 ) were fitted separately . the marquardt fitting procedure @xcite was used , which minimizes @xmath43 , the summed squared deviation normalized by the squared noise , between the data and the model .",
    "fitting was first attempted with a single component for each molecule , but the residuals suggested that a better fit could be obtained with multiple velocity components .",
    "the model that we used assumed that each molecule is found in one or two absorbing components .",
    "each component is described by its doppler shift , @xmath44 , its gaussian line width ( @xmath45 half width = ( 2kt / m)@xmath46 ) , @xmath47 , the molecule s column density , @xmath48 , the rotational temperature of the gas , @xmath26 , and the covering factor , @xmath49 , ( the fraction of the background continuum source covered by the component ) .",
    "the fitted column density is the average over the partially covered source , so the column density in the covered portion would be @xmath50 . a covering factor of , e.g. , 10% means that lines saturate at 90% of the continuum flux and the column density in the absorbing component is ten times the average over the continuum source . the effect modeled in this way could also result from veiling ( continuum emission from foreground or surrounding material ) or from re - emission in the lines by the absorbing molecules .",
    "the components were assumed to overlap by the products of their covering factors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "the following equation was used to calculate the observed transmission :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the covering factors for the two components .",
    "this results in a greater absorption in saturated lines than would result if the optical depths were added first and then the transmission spectrum was calculated from the optical depth spectrum .",
    "this approach was chosen because it gave a better fit to the data than adding the optical depths first and assuming the same covering factor , but it assumes that different components absorb along different lines of sight to a partially covered continuum source , which may not be the case .    a frequency correction was allowed for each spectral setting observed , to correct for errors in wavelength calibration . with only one exception ,",
    "the correction was less than a 1  doppler shift .",
    "in addition , a broadening of the instrumental resolution was permitted in the fitting to allow for imperfect internal instrument focusing , or possibly a ` macroturbulent ' broadening in the absorbing gas .",
    "the fitting program chose a resolution a factor of 1.2 greater than that derived from gas cell data . a constant frequency resolution ( as opposed to a constant doppler resolution )",
    "was used in each of the two fitted regions .",
    "this represents well the improving resolving power toward shorter wavelengths in the 10.7 - 13.7  @xmath18mregion .",
    "in addition to these parameters , the continuum , slope , and curvature of each echelon order were varied , to allow correction of the baseline fitting done during data reduction .",

    "although it might not be apparent from the spectra , given the shallowness of the lines , many of the detected lines are at least moderately saturated , and some are very saturated .",
    "the lines only appear weak because of the small covering factors ( or emission filling in the absorption lines ) and to a lesser extent the small line widths .",

    "so , adapting the model for this object may give predictions closer to the observations .",
    "the star in ngc 7538 irs 1 is believed to be a 30 m@xmath110 star .",
    "the different radiation field may affect the resulting chemistry .",
    "@xcite present a model of chemical evolution of the envelopes of massive protostars using afgl 2591 as an example . from that model , they conclude that enhancements of c@xmath0h@xmath0 , hcn and ch@xmath4  are possible at late times in the evolution ( @xmath115 years ) and at high temperature ( @xmath116 800 k ) .",
    "our derived temperatures indicate cooler material , yet the molecules seem to be enhanced in the line of sight .",
    "alternatively , these species could be produced at high temperature in the inner disk , and subsequently brought outward by the disk wind . including uv and x - ray radiation in the model",
    "affects the chemistry especially relating to hcn .",
    "@xcite find that increasing the uv and x - ray flux can lead to enhanced hcn starting by the ionization of n@xmath0 .",
    "the column densities for hcn and cs from the @xcite model of protostar afgl 2591 agree with our observed abundances while their column densities for c@xmath0h@xmath0 , ch@xmath4 , and nh@xmath3  are lower than our observed values .",
    "hot core and disk chemistry models predict the enhancement of molecules such as c@xmath0h@xmath0 , ch@xmath4 , and nh@xmath3 .",
    "however , the observed abundance of c@xmath0h@xmath0  is higher than what models predict from warm gas - phase chemistry ( see table [ tab : mods ] ) .",
    "this indicates that c@xmath0h@xmath0  is probably frozen on dust grains and sublimates along with molecules like ch@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite studied the solid features of c@xmath0h@xmath0 , especially when mixed with h@xmath0o  or co. they found that the c@xmath0h@xmath0  features broaden substantially when mixed with h@xmath0o  and to a lesser extent when mixed with co. they compare the laboratory data to  data for the colder neighbor , irs  9 , which resulted in an upper limit of @xmath117  for the column density of solid c@xmath0h@xmath0 .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with the observed gas - phase column density seen toward irs  1 .",
    "so , it is possible that solid c@xmath0h@xmath0  is sublimating from grain mantles as protostars heat the environment .",
    "the observed ch@xmath3/ch@xmath4  ratio agrees with the branching ratio for the destruction of ch@xmath4 .",
    "based on these results ch@xmath0  should also be very abundant .",
    "we now attempt to construct a physical and geometrical model of ngc  7538  irs  1 . within the possible scenarios presented from various radio and infrared observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we propose a scenario in which the molecular absorption presented here comes from a circumstellar disk .",
    "we will examine other possibilities first .",
    "figure [ fig : cartoon ] depicts the possible scenarios allowed by the available observations .",
    "we can quickly rule out a simple model in which the absorbing molecular gas is in the foreground molecular cloud and not closely associated with irs  1 .",
    "our observations require the gas to be much hotter ( @xmath116 300  k ) and denser ( @xmath118  to maintain rotational lte of hcn out to @xmath119 ) than is found away from luminous sources in molecular clouds . according to @xcite , temperatures do not reach the observed values until you get to within 400 au of the central star .",
    "in addition , the infraredradiation field must have a brightness temperature @xmath9300  k to populate the c@xmath0h@xmath0  @xmath23 level sufficiently to account for the observed 2@xmath23@xmath23  absorption . undoubtedly , the absorbing molecular gas is in close proximity to the infraredcontinuum source irs  1 .",
    "it is not quite so easy to rule out a model in which the absorbing molecules are in boundary region between the envelope around the irs  1hypercompact h  ii region and the outflow .",
    "this gas could be compressed by the ionized wind , and if it is as close as 0.1 , or 280  au , from a @xmath120 source it would have a temperature near 300  k. the temperature structure determined by @xcite indicates that indeed temperatures range from 200  400 k at radii of 220380 au .",
    "however , interaction with the ionized wind , which has a velocity @xmath9100  , would be expected to accelerate the gas , causing broad , blue - shifted absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the observed lines have widths of @xmath121  and have centroids within a few  of those seen in surrounding molecular gas . another argument against the presence of the observed gas in an envelope around irs  1",
    "is the fact that net absorption is seen .",
    "since the vibrational temperature is comparable to the brightness temperature of the continuum radiation , emission lines would be seen if the molecular gas had a larger extent than the continuum source .",
    "if the lines arose in molecular shell surrounding the hypercompact h  ii region , this probably would be the case .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite proposes that the centimeter continuum from irs 1 results from partially ionized material in an outflow . the centimeter continuum emission has been spatially resolved into knots by @xcite , who suggest that the emission comes from photo - evaporation of knots of neutral molecular material ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "the ch@xmath3oh  masers seen by @xcite also seem to trace the knotty structure ( in addition to the disk described in  [ sec : intro ] ) probed by the cm continuum emission .",
    "the knots may be material stripped from the disk .",
    "the stellar wind would then blow on these knots .",
    "however , if our molecules are in these knots we would expect large velocity difference between the knots resulting in broad lines , which are not observed . if we compare the velocities we derive for the two components of our molecules to those observed for the ch@xmath3oh  masers",
    ", we find that they match the two velocities found for the a cluster of masers .",
    "this indicates that the infrared observations may be probing the same gas as the ch@xmath3oh  masers .",
    "this scenario is further supported by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite also find that the interpretation of the masers tracing a disk also agrees with their observations .",
    "we propose that the absorbing material is in a circumstellar disk .",
    "there is evidence for a disk close to edge - on from other observations and models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this situation , hot dust in the surface layers or the inner rim of a flared disk could provide the continuum source .",
    "with a nearly edge - on orientation , radiation from the inner region could pass through the outer disk atmosphere , where absorption lines could be formed .",
    "emission from some of the dust on the surface of a slightly inclined disk or in an outflow could be observed directly , accounting for the dilution of the spectrum that we modeled with a small covering factor .",
    "this scenario is similar to the one described by @xcite to describe c@xmath0h@xmath0  and hcn absorption toward the low - mass protostar irs 46 in ophiuchus ( ylw 16b ) .",
    "detailed modeling of the disk structure of irs 46 showed that it was possible to have the absorbing material in the disk illuminated by the continuum from the surface .",
    "figure [ fig : cartoon ] is a cartoon of our proposed picture , where the orange rays represent the continuum .",
    "some of the continuum radiation passes through the absorbing outer disk . in this scenario ,",
    "dust settling is likely to occur , allowing for observations of large columns of gas without too much dust .",
    "here we present a summary of our conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "ngc  7538  irs  1  has a rich spectrum in the mid - infrared . at high spectral resolution ,",
    "lines of previously observed molecules such as c@xmath0h@xmath0and hcn are seen as well as weak lines of molecules such as hnco , ch@xmath3 , nh@xmath3 , ch@xmath4 , and cs .",
    "we have presented the first infrared detection of interstellar hnco .",
    "this is also the first detection of ch@xmath3  toward dense gas .",
    "the data show shallow yet saturated lines indicating that either the absorbing gas does not fully cover the continuum source or there is emission filling in the absorption .",
    "the observed ortho : para equivalent width ratio for c@xmath0h@xmath0  is @xmath9 1.5 instead of the expected value of 3 .",
    "the rotational temperatures for the various molecules range between 200 and 400 k with the exception of ch@xmath3 , which has one hot component ( @xmath122 k ) . from the derived temperatures",
    ", we find that the gas is within @xmath9 400 au of the central star @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the material traces a close to edge - on circumstellar disk as determined from other observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it can also be tracing hot , knotty material close in to the star ( see figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .    \\5 .",
    "because it is possible to use hot core chemistry to describe chemistry in a disk , the different chemical models do not help identify the physical location of the absorbing gas .",
    "however , the models do seem to indicate that ngc  7538  irs  1  is an evolved protostar with an age @xmath123 years .",
    "our observations help constrain the chemistry in massive protostars .",
    "the abundances for all the molecules are enhanced , except for possibly cs ( see discussion in    [ sec : ch4cs ] ) .",
    "species known to be present in icy mantles such as ch@xmath4  and nh@xmath3  have high column densities suggesting that they have recently sublimated from grain mantles . the high abundance of the daughter molecules such ch@xmath3  gives constraints on the gas - phase chemistry happening after sublimation of ices .",
    "hnco also provides some constraints about the presence of ocn@xmath102  on dust grains .",
    "it is unclear whether c@xmath0h@xmath0  is a parent molecule or a product of warm gas - phase chemistry . for molecules like hcn ,",
    "uv / x - ray radiation is important in producing the observed abundances .",
    "ch@xmath3  is a nearly planar molecule and thus do not expect to see inversion transitions as observed in nh@xmath3 . we observe the out - of - plane vibrational mode ( similar to the umbrella mode in nh@xmath3 ) .",
    "we observe splitting due to spin - rotation interactions . for symmetric - top molecules , the splitting of a rotational level",
    "is given by      where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the spin - rotation coupling constants for the b and c axes , respectively , at a given vibrational state , @xmath127 .",
    "we use equation ( [ eq : ch3 ] ) in deriving the splitting for the lines we observed .",
    "the values for @xmath125 and @xmath128 were taken from @xcite .",
    "hnco is a quasilinear , nearly symmetric - top molecule .",
    "the moment of inertia about the figure axis is small and the moments of inertia about the other two axes are much larger ( @xmath9 100 times larger ) and about equal to each other . because it is a slightly asymmetric molecule , the levels with k @xmath129 0 are split into two components . @xcite",
