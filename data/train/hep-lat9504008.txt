    "understanding the mechanism of quark confinement is a central problem in the high energy physics .",
    "this requires , among other things , to identify the dynamical variables which are relevant to the confinement .",
    "a satisfying solution would be to set up an approximate vacuum state which confines color charges .",
    "this way one could derive an effective action which describe the long - distance properties of qcd  @xcite . even this incomplete program , however , mandates a non - perturbative approach .",
    "fortunately we have at our disposal a framework in which we can do non - perturbative calculations , namely the lattice discretization of gauge theories .",
    "since a typical monte carlo simulation generates vacuum configurations , one expects to gain information on the non - perturbative vacuum structure .",
    "however a guideless search into the numerical configurations generated during monte carlo runs is hopeless . in other words ,",
    "we need some theoretical input which selects the dynamical variables relevant to the confinement .",
    "the situation looks similar to the theory of superconductivity .",
    "indeed , it was the cooper s observation that the fermi surface is unstable with regard to the formation of bounded electron pairs which led bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer to formulate the successful bcs superconductivity theory  @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility has been conjectured long time ago by g.  t  hooft  @xcite and s.  mandelstam  @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed that the confining vacuum behaves as a coherent state of color magnetic monopoles .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the vacuum is a magnetic ( dual ) superconductor .",
    "this fascinating proposal offers a picture of confinement whose physics can be clearly extracted . as a matter of fact",
    ", the dual meissner effect causes the formation of chromoelectric flux tubes between chromoelectric charges leading to a linear rising potential .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss briefly the t  hooft s proposal  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the non - abelian gauge theory spontaneously broken via the higgs mechanism .",
    "the higgs fields are in the adjoint representation . for concreteness",
    "we focus on the georgi - glashow model  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the georgi - glashow model allows field configurations which correspond to magnetic monopoles  @xcite . moreover",
    ", one readily finds that the monopole mass is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the charged vector boson , @xmath6 a constant and @xmath7 the fine structure constant .",
    "the dual superconductor scenario is realized if these magnetic monopoles condense by means of the magnetic higgs mechanism .",
    "this means that the monopoles become tachionic : @xmath8 from equation we see that @xmath9 ( if we kept @xmath7 fixed ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 must go through zero suggests that the original higgs field could be removed .",
    "thus we are led to consider the pure gauge theory without elementary higgs fields .",
    "the role of the scalar higgs field is played by any operator which transforms in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "more precisely , after choosing an operator @xmath11 which transforms according to the adjoint representation , one fixes the gauge by diagonalizing @xmath11 at each point .",
    "this choice does not fix the gauge completely ; it leaves as residual invariance group the maximally abelian ( cartan ) subgroup of the gauge group .",
    "such a procedure is known as abelian projection  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the gauge group is su(n ) , then after gauge fixing the residual invariance group is @xmath12 .",
    "the world line of the monopoles can be identified as the lines where two eigenvalues of the operator @xmath11 are equal .",
    "the dual superconductor idea is realized if these abelian monopoles condense .",
    "it is evident that the monopoles are dynamical ; they will take part in the dynamics of the system . as a consequence the problem of monopole condensation can not be dealt with the perturbation theory . on the other hand",
    ", the abelian projection can be implemented on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "thus one can analyze the dynamics of the abelian projected gauge fields by means of monte carlo simulations . in the following",
    "we shall consider the pure su(2 ) gauge theory .    to perform the abelian projection",
    "we make a choice for @xmath11 .",
    "the simpler possibility is to consider a local quantity .",
    "for instance , we can use a plaquette with a definite orientation ( field - strength gauge ) or the polyakov loop ( polyakov gauge ) . in these unitary gauges",
    "we implement the gauge fixing by means of the matrices @xmath13 which diagonalize @xmath11 at each lattice site : @xmath14 \\quad .\\ ] ] it is straightforward to check that the residual gauge invariance group is the u(1 ) group with transformations @xmath15 .",
    "the abelian projection of the gauge transformed links @xmath16 amounts to write @xmath17 with @xmath18 \\quad , \\ ] ] @xmath19_{11 } \\quad .\\ ] ] @xmath20 is the abelian projection of @xmath21 .",
    "a different class of gauge fixing has been proposed in the literature , namely the abelian covariant gauge or maximally abelian gauge  @xcite . in the continuum",
    "the maximally abelian gauge corresponds to impose the constraints  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the @xmath25-covariant derivative . on the lattice the constraints  ( [ dmuamu ] ) can be implemented like the landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "indeed equation ( [ dmuamu ] ) corresponds on the lattice to diagonalize  @xcite @xmath26 to do this it is enough to maximize iteratively the quantity @xmath27 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the @xmath21 s are the gauge transformed links  ( [ utilde ] ) .",
    "we thereby obtain the matrices @xmath13 and perform the abelian projection of the links by eqs .",
    "( [ utilde])-([theta ] ) .    from the above discussion",
    "it is evident that the monopole dynamic does depend on the choice of the operator needed to fix the gauge . on the other hand the confinement of color charges via monopole condensation can not depend on the gauge fixing .",
    "however , it is conceivable that the dual superconductor scenario could manifest with a judicious choice of @xmath11 . this outcome could arise from a gauge fixing which freezes the degrees of freedom which are irrelevant to the confinement .",
    "we feel that the situation is similar to the time - honored bcs theory of superconductivity . indeed in the bcs theory one",
    "deals with a reduced hamiltonian which breaks the electromagnetic gauge invariance . nevertheless , the reduced bcs hamiltonian offered the correct explanation of the meissner effect . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was showed  @xcite that the collective states which are essential to restore the gauge invariance do not contribute to the bcs calculation of the meissner effect . in other words ,",
    "the reduced bcs hamiltonian , by retaining the degrees of freedom relevant to the superconductivity , gives a sensible answer even though it breaks the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "interesting enough , it turns out that , if one fixes the maximally abelian gauge , the abelian projected links seem to retain the informations relevant to the confinement  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to deepen the study of the dynamics of the abelian projected fields in that particular gauge fixing .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze the finger - print of the dual superconductor hypothesis , namely the meissner effect . to this end",
    ", we analyze the distribution of the color field due to static quark - antiquark pair in su(2 ) lattice gauge theory in the maximally abelian gauge .",
    "moreover we will study the gauge dependence of the london penetration length .",
    "a partial account of this paper has been published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we explore the field configurations produced by the quark - antiquark static pairs both in the case of abelian projected links after maximally abelian gauge has been fixed , and in the case of full su(2 ) links . in sec .",

    "iv we investigate the relation between the penetration length and the string tension .",
    "our conclusions are relegated in sec . v.",
    "the appendix comprises several technical details on the maximally abelian gauge fixing .",
    "in this section we analyze the distribution of the color fields due to static quark - antiquark pairs . following the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can measure the color fields by means of the correlation of a plaquette @xmath28 with a wilson loop @xmath29 .",
    "the plaquette is connected to the wilson loop by a schwinger line l ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : correlator ] ) . moving the plaquette @xmath28 with respect to the wilson loop",
    "one can scan the structure of the color fields . in a previous study  @xcite we found evidence of the dual meissner effect in the maximally abelian gauge .",
    "in particular we measured the penetration depth of the flux tube chromoelectric field . however in ref .",
    "@xcite we employed rather small lattices ( @xmath30 ) . in this work",
    "we extend our previous study in two directions .",

    "[ fig : correlator ] ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the plaquette in the @xmath35 plane .",
    "note that the correlation function  ( [ rhow ] ) is sensitive to the field strength rather than to the square of the field strength  @xcite : @xmath36   \\;.\\ ] ] according to eq.([rhowlimcont ] ) we define the color field strength tensor as : @xmath37 by varying the distance and the orientation of the plaquette @xmath38 with respect to the wilson loop @xmath29 , one can scan the color field distribution of the flux tube .",
    "we performed numerical simulations with wilson action and periodic boundary conditions using an overrelaxed metropolis algorithm .",
    "our data refer to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 lattices . to evaluate the correlator eq .",
    "( [ rhow ] ) we used square wilson loop @xmath42 , with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 being the lattice size ) , and rectangular wilson loops @xmath45 .    in order to reduce the quantum fluctuations we adopted the controlled cooling algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it is known  @xcite that by cooling in a smooth way equilibrium configurations , quantum fluctuations are reduced by a few order of magnitude , while the string tension survives and shows a plateau .",
    "we shall show below that the penetration length behaves in a similar way .    for reader convenience let us , briefly ,",
    "illustrate our cooling procedure .",
    "the lattice gauge configurations are cooled by replacing the matrix @xmath46 associated to each link @xmath47 with a new matrix @xmath48 in such a way that the local contribution to the lattice action @xmath49 is minimized .",
    "@xmath50 is the sum over the `` u - staples '' involving the link @xmath51 and @xmath52 , so that @xmath53  su(2 ) . in",
    "a `` controlled '' or `` smooth '' cooling step we have @xmath54 where @xmath13 is the su(2 ) matrix which maximizes @xmath55 subjected to the following constraint on the su(2 ) distance between @xmath46 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 \\ ; \\le \\delta^2 \\,.\\ ] ] we adopt @xmath58 .",
    "a complete cooling sweep consists in the replacement eq .   at each lattice site .",
    "we do the above replacement vector - like according to the standard checkerboard order .",
    "the cooling technique allows us to disentangle the signal from the noise with a relatively small statistics . after discarding about 3000 sweeps to insure thermalization",
    "we collect measurements on configurations separated by 100 upgrades for 9 different values of @xmath59 in the range @xmath60 after cooling we obtained a good signal for @xmath61 on very small statistical samples ( @xmath62 configurations ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fmunu ] we report our results for the field strength tensor @xmath63 , where the coordinates @xmath64 , @xmath65 measure respectively the distance from the middle point between quark and antiquark ( which corresponds to the center of the spatial side of the wilson loop @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ rhow ] ) ) and the distance out of the plane defined by the wilson loop .    the entries in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmunu ] refer to measurements of the field strength tensor taken in the middle of the flux tube ( @xmath66 ) with 8 cooling steps at @xmath67 on the @xmath41 lattice , using a square wilson loop @xmath29 of size @xmath68 .",
    "our results show that @xmath61 is sizeable when @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in parallel planes .",
    "this corresponds to measure the component @xmath69 of the chromoelectric field directed along the line joining the @xmath70 pair ( @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmunu ] ) .",
    "moreover we see that @xmath72 decreases rapidly in the transverse direction @xmath65 . in figure",
    "[ fig : el(xt ) ] we display the transverse distribution of the longitudinal chromoelectric field along the flux tube .",
    "the static color sources are at @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( in lattice units ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : el(xt ) ] shows that the effects of the color sources on the chromoelectric fields extends over about three lattice spacings .",
    "remarkably , far from the sources the longitudinal chromoelectric field is almost constant along the @xmath75 line .",
    "thus , the color field structure of the @xmath76 tube which emerges from our results is quite simple : the flux tube is almost completely formed by the longitudinal chromoelectric field which is constant along the flux tube ( if @xmath64 is not too close to the static color sources ) and decreases rapidly in the transverse direction .      in the t  hooft formulation  @xcite the dual superconductor model is elaborated through the abelian projection .",
    "the idea is that the abelian projected gauge fields retain the long distance physics of the gauge system .",
    "in particular the physical quantities related to the confinement should be independent of the gauge fixing , and agree with those obtained in the full gauge system .",
    "this suggested us  @xcite to investigate the abelian projected correlator @xmath77 the correlator @xmath78 is obtained from eq . with the substitution @xmath79 .",

    "@xcite with the overrelaxation parameter @xmath85 ( for further details see the appendix ) .",
    "remarkably enough , it turns out that the abelian field strength tensor @xmath86 behaves like the gauge - invariant one defined by eq .. in figure  [ fig : fmunuab ] we report our results for the field strength tensor @xmath63 evaluated on maximally abelian projected gauge configurations .",
    "the entries in figure  [ fig : fmunuab ] refer to measurements done at @xmath87 on a @xmath39 lattice at @xmath88 using a square wilson loop of size @xmath89 in eq .  .",

    "the longitudinal abelian chromoelectric field , likewise the non abelian one , does not depend on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath64 , far from the static sources .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that fig .",
    "[ fig : el_ab(xt ) ] suggests that the abelian static sources are more localized than the non abelian ones .",
    "this is in accordance with our previous observation that the maximally abelian gauge fixing seems to reduce the fluctuations which are unimportant for the long distance physics .    in the next section",
    "we shall analyze our numerical data within the dual superconductor hypothesis .",
    "if the dual superconductor scenario holds , the transverse shape of the longitudinal chromoelectric field @xmath69 should resemble the dual version of the abrikosov vortex field distribution .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath93 can be fitted according to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the modified bessel function of order zero , @xmath96 is the external flux , and @xmath97 is the london penetration length .",
    "equation   is valid if @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the coherence length ( type - ii superconductor ) .",
    "the length @xmath99 measures the coherence of the magnetic monopole condensate ( the dual version of the cooper condensate ) . to determine the coherence length one should measure the correlation between the chromomagnetic monopoles . to do",
    "this one should construct a monopole creation operator .",
    "unfortunately , thus far there is no a convincing proposal for the monopole operator .",
    "however , recently a promising proposal has been advanced in ref .",
    "we shall return on this matter in section  [ section_v ] for the time being , because we are not able to determine the coherence length , we analyze our data far from the coherence region . to this end",
    "we try a fit with the transverse distribution   by discarding the points nearest to the flux tube ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "let us discuss , firstly , the gauge invariant correlator eq .. we fit eq . to our data for @xmath101 ( in lattice units ) obtaining @xmath102 ( we used the minuit code from the cernlib ) . in figure",

    "we can see that within the statistical uncertainties the fit parameters are quite stable .",
    "so we are confident that our determination of the london penetration length is trustworthy .",
    "we ascertained , moreover , that the data obtained from the gauge - invariant correlator with cooled gauge configurations leads to a parameter @xmath103 which shows a plateau versus the number of cooling steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_vs_cooling ] ) .",
    "this corroborates our expectation that the long range physics is unaffected by the cooling procedure .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig : phi_vs_cooling ] indicates that the overall normalization of the transverse distribution of the longitudinal chromoelectric field is affected by the cooling . in fact the parameter @xmath96 does not stay constant with the cooling .",
    "we feel that this is an indication that the flux @xmath96 is strongly affected by lattice artefact .",
    "this point will be thoroughly discussed below .    in figures  [ fig : mu_vs_beta ] and  [ fig : phi_vs_beta ] we display the inverse of the penetration length @xmath103 ( in units of @xmath106 ) and the external flux @xmath96 versus @xmath59 .",
    "these data are obtained by fitting eq . to the data extracted from square wilson loop ( open points ) and rectangular wilson loops ( full points ) .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "a look at figure  [ fig : mu_vs_beta ] shows that the inverse of the penetration length @xmath103 agrees within statistical fluctuations for both kinds of wilson loops .",
    "however we see that for @xmath107 the parameter @xmath103 arising from the rectangular wilson loops seem to display sizeable finite volume effects .",
    "on the other hand we find that the parameter @xmath103 extracted from the square wilson loops displays finite volume effects for @xmath108 , in the case of the @xmath41 lattice .",

    "equations and corroborates our previous observation on the consistency of the penetration length . by fitting all the data we obtain @xmath114 it is worthwhile to stress that our evidence for asymptotic scaling of the penetration length is only indicative . in general",
    "it should be much easier to check scaling rather than asymptotic scaling .",
    "we looked at the scaling of @xmath103 extracted from square wilson loops with the square root of the string tension ( we have used the string tension extracted from large wilson loops ) .",
    "we found that there is approximate scaling of @xmath103 with @xmath115 for @xmath116 : @xmath117 so we see that our data on the penetration length are in agreement with the general expectation that scaling goes better than asymptotic scaling . on the other hand , the approximate evidence of asymptotic scaling is a natural consequence of the fact that the penetration length is a physical quantity related to the size @xmath118 of the flux tube  @xcite : @xmath119 as concern the parameter @xmath96 , figure  [ fig : phi_vs_beta ] shows that @xmath96 is rather insensitive to the shape of the wilson loops used in eq .",

    "is consistent with ( star in fig .",
    "[ fig : string_tension ] ) @xmath156 the value quoted in eq",
    ".   has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by the linear asymptotic extrapolation of the string tension data extracted from wilson loops on lattices larger than ours .",
    "let us conclude by stressing the main results of this paper .",
    "we investigated the color field strength tensor of the @xmath76 flux tube by means of the connected correlators   ( full su(2 ) ) and   ( maximally abelian gauge ) .    the main advantage of using the connected correlator   and   resides in the fact that the connected correlators are sensitive to the field strength rather than to the square of the field strength . as a consequence we are able to detect a sizeable signal even with relatively low statistics .",
    "it turns out that the flux tube color fields is composed by the chromoelectric component parallel to the line joining the static charges .",
    "moreover the longitudinal chromoelectric field is almost constant far from the color sources , and it decreases rapidly in the directions transverse to the line connecting the charges . as a matter of fact we found that the transverse distribution of the longitudinal chromoelectric field behaves in accord with the dual meissner effect .",
    "this allows us to determine the london penetration length .",
    "we checked that the penetration length is a physical gauge invariant quantity .",
    "a remarkable consequence of our findings is that the long range properties of the su(2 ) confining vacuum can be described by an effective abelian theory .",
    "in addition , after fixing the gauge with the constraints  - , it seems that the degrees of freedom which are not relevant to the confinement get suppressed .",
    "finally , we put out a very simple relation between the string tension and the penetration length which gives an extimate of @xmath115 quite close to the extrapolated continuum limit available in the literature .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to stress that the most urgent problem to be addressed in the future studies is the reliable extimation of the coherence length @xmath99 .",
    "the results in sect .",
    "iii give an indirect and , admittedly , very weak indication that @xmath141 .",
    "as we have already discussed , the coherence length is determined by the monopole condensate , the order parameter for the confinement . recently",
    "two different groups  @xcite give an extimation of the coherence length . these authors calculate the electric flux and magnetic monopole current distribution in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair for su(2 ) lattice gauge theory in the maximally abelian gauge .",
    "the magnetic monopoles are identified using the degrand - toussaint  @xcite construction . by using a dual form of the ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite , which allows the magnitude of the monopole condensate density to vary in space",
    ", they fitted the data and obtain @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "they found that the coherence length is comparable to the penetration length . even though we feel that the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite is interesting , we would like to observe that it relies heavily on the definition of the magnetic monopole current . as a matter of fact , in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out that the degrand - toussaint definition of the monopole density is plagued by lattice artefacts , which are , however , less severe in maximally abelian gauge . so that the degrand - toussaint monopole density is not an order parameter for confinement .",
    "thus the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite is plagued by the ambiguities related to the definition of the monopole current .",
    "on the other hand , in our approach we work outside the coherence region , so that we feel that our results do not manifest the above mentioned problem . to clarify this point",
    ", it should be of great help the study of the distribution of color fields in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair in the framework of the dual ginzburg - landau model with the magnetic monopole current constructed by means of the monopole creation operator proposed in ref .",
    "in this appendix we give more details on the algorithm used to fix the maximally abelian gauge . on the lattice ,",
    "the maximally abelian gauge is obtained by maximizing the lattice functional @xmath159\\ ] ] over all su(2 ) gauge transformations @xmath160 where @xmath161  su(2 ) . under an arbitrary gauge transformation the variation of the lattice functional eq .",
    "is @xmath162 - \\frac{1}{2 } \\text{tr } \\left [ \\sigma_3 x(x ) \\right ] \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath163\\ ] ] belongs to the su(2 ) algebra .",
    "if we have locally maximized the lattice functional   with respect to an arbitrary gauge transformation , then we have @xmath164 from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath165 i.e. @xmath11 must be diagonal . so that maximizing @xmath166 is equivalent to diagonalizing the hermitian matrix @xmath11 . note that maximization of @xmath166 at the given lattice site @xmath167 is accomplished by a gauge transformation @xmath168 , which , in turn , affects the value of the local operator @xmath11 at the nearest neighbours",
    ". therefore the maximization of the lattice functional   can be achieved only by an iterative procedure over the whole lattice . in equivalent manner",
    "one can find @xmath168 as the matrix which diagonalizes @xmath11 or as the matrix which maximizes @xmath166 .    to obtain explicitly the gauge element @xmath168 which maximizes @xmath166 ,",
    "let us write @xmath166 as @xmath169\\\\ & = k(x ) \\frac{1}{2 }   \\text{tr } \\left[\\sigma_3   g^\\dagger(x ) \\sigma_3 g(x ) v(x ) \\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 ensuring that @xmath13 is an element of su(2 ) . as one can easily recognize from eq .",
    "@xmath171 note that the term proportional to @xmath172 is absent .",
    "now , we observe that , if we consider @xmath173 ( with @xmath174 ) instead of @xmath168 , then eq .   is invariant .",
    "so we can assume without loss of generality that in eq .",
    "@xmath175 . as a consequence , eq .",
    "is maximized when @xmath176 since maximization of   results in an iterative procedure , we must have at disposal a convergence criterion . to have a measure of the goodness of gauge fixing we consider the average size of the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath177 over the whole lattice : @xmath178\\ ] ] where @xmath179 .",
    "we stop the iterations when @xmath180 where @xmath118 is some ( small ) positive number . in our simulation",
    "we used @xmath181 .    in order to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm we adopted the overrelaxation method  @xcite suggested in ref .",
    "once we have found the matrix @xmath168 which maximizes  , we make the following substitution @xmath182 where the overrelaxation parameter @xmath183 varies in the interval @xmath184 .",
    "the exponentiation in eq .",
    "is obtained through the following representation for an element @xmath185  su(2 ) : @xmath186 where @xmath187 .    in our monte carlo",
    "runs we used @xmath188 .",
    "however , we would like to stress that it exists  @xcite an optimal overrelaxation parameter @xmath189 .",
    "moreover for large lattice size @xmath44 it is believed that @xmath190 where the constant @xmath191 is problem dependent . as a matter of fact it turns out that a better convergence can be obtained using values of @xmath183 close to @xmath192 ( see figure  [ fig : overrelaxation ] ) .",
    "indeed we obtained @xmath193 for @xmath31 . inserting this value into eq .",
    "we find @xmath194 .",
    "it is remarkable that our value for the constant @xmath191 agrees with the one relevant to the landau gauge fixing  @xcite .",
