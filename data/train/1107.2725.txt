    ", this theory crosses over smoothly to the case of a quasi-2d trap , where a single hcir occurs with a negative s - wave scattering length , @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "both the observation of multiple resonances and 2d resonances with repulsive interactions are in disagreement with standard hcir predictions @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "a detailed explanation is proposed for these anomalous resonances .",
    "the mechanism is that the new resonances are due to center - of - mass ( com ) excitations of molecules or atom pairs .",
    "these have a different character to the excitation of internal molecular degrees of freedom found in the olshanii approach and its generalizations .",
    "the new com resonances can only become coupled to the input state by anharmonic terms in the trapping potential .",
    "hence , we term these effects anharmonic confinement induced resonances ( acir ) .",
    "the acir resonances can not occur in harmonic traps due to kohn s theorem @xcite .",

    "they provide a fundamentally new pairing mechanism , which may lead to new opportunities for quantum engineering in atomic , photonic or acoustic waveguides .",
    "our results are therefore qualitatively different to harmonic cir .",
    "we predict both multiple 1d resonances and 2d resonances with repulsive interactions .",

    "kestner and duan @xcite treat anharmonic resonance in a double well . in a more recent investigation , parallel to our own , sala et al @xcite",
    "have also concluded that the recent innsbruck experiments provide evidence for acir resonances .",
    "the main differences in the treatment are that we have accurately calculated the size of the anharmonic resonance shifts , as well as giving quantitative estimates of relevant parameters .",
    "we also compare our theory with the observed multiple resonances , including even and odd order com resonances .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we first analyze the types of transverse excitations available , and the operational processes that can lead to the observed resonances ( sec.[sec : two - body - cir ] ) . in sec.[sec",
    ": nonlinear - cir ] , a hamiltonian model of nonlinear cir is presented , by introducing anharmonic perturbations in the hamiltonian . in sec.[sec : nonlinear - cir-1d ] , this is analyzed using perturbation theory for the 1d case .",
    "the results are compared to experiments on anisotropic traps , showing the observed splitting is well - explained with the anharmonic com resonance acir model .",
    "next , we consider results for the case of large trap anisotropies , and demonstrate that the observed resonances can be quantitatively explained with excellent accuracy by considering multiple resonances with both even and odd order com transverse quantum numbers .",
    "a similar calculation is carried out for a quasi-2d system in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear - cir-2d ] , which is also compared with experiment .",
    "the main results are summarized in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in recent one and two dimensional confinement induced resonance experiments , there are many observed resonances not explained by conventional cir theory . in two dimensions , resonances are observed for @xmath0 , ( the bec side of the resonance ) which is the opposite to that expected in the usual theory . similarly , unexplained multiple resonances occur for one - dimensional cir with anisotropic transverse confinement .",
    "these are also not predicted by the simple two - particle model @xcite with linear confinement .",
    "however , the experiments have some features not included in this idealized model , and the obvious question is : which experimental properties are responsible for the additional observed resonances ?      the possible modes of excitation of a pair of atoms in a transverse potential are illustrated in fig.[fig:(color - online)-schematic diagram ] . the com mode is shown in ( a ) , with two atoms moving together .",
    "this is not coupled to the atomic ground state in a harmonic trap , due to kohn s theorem .",
    "the relative motion mode is shown in ( b ) , with an excitation of the relative coordinate .",
    "this is the usual harmonic confinement induced resonance in a one dimensional waveguide with a transverse parabolic potential .",
    "the hcir resonance is simply the first _ internally _ excited resonance of the two - body ground state .    ]",
    "however , there is a subtlety here . both types of excitation are an adiabatic continuation of the transversely excited free - particle states , as the inter - particle interaction is increased .",
    "the free - particle states have both center - of - mass ( com ) quantum numbers @xmath5 and internal quantum numbers , @xmath6 . therefore , there are a large number of possible excited states that could , in principle , be coupled to the atomic ground state in a feshbach type of resonance .    in a rotationally symmetric model , both",
    "the internal and com excited states near @xmath7 are degenerate in energy , and can not lead to distinct resonances even if coupled to the incoming states . if there is no rotational symmetry , this degeneracy is broken , leading to the possibility of multiple resonances . experimentally there is more than one resonance in the recent innsbruck experiment @xcite . due to the similarity with the hcir predictions @xcite , these were initially identified as conventional harmonic cir resonances , corresponding to excitations of internal degrees of freedom",
    ".    however , an analysis of the anisotropic case @xcite indicates that internally excited two - body states only give rise to only a _",
    "single _ cir .",
    "we note that kohn s theorem @xcite prohibits the excitation of com resonances from incoming states with no transverse momentum , if the confinement is parabolic .",
    "one may ask why there are not multiple cir eigenstates with different internal energies due to the different confinement strength in orthogonal trap directions .",
    "the reason for this is due to the singular nature of the interaction .",
    "consider what happens to a single particle in a rotationally symmetric potential , which corresponds to the internal quantum numbers in a relative coordinate picture of a two - particle problem . in a 2d system of noninteracting particles in a harmonic oscillator potential",
    ", the ground state has @xmath8 .",
    "the internally excited states can therefore be labelled either by their internal harmonic oscillator quantum numbers for relative motion , or by their angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "this , one can have @xmath9 , or else a radial quantum number @xmath10 and a magnetic quantum number @xmath11 . due to the singular potential at the origin , only s - wave incoming states with @xmath12 experience any coupling .",
    "this leads to a relatively low - lying excited state due to the coupling , and hence to a single cir .",
    "this state is adiabatically deformed when the symmetry is broken , without leading to a second cir .",
    "this single degenerate cir exists on the positive side of the feshbach resonance i.e , @xmath0 for a quasi-1d system .",
    "it transfers to the negative side , i.e. , @xmath3 for a large asymmetry or a quasi-2d system .",
    "this last conclusion is compatible with other calculations of 2d cir .",
    "however , these conclusions only take into account the _ internal _ energy of a two - particle state , not the com energy .      in recent bosonic experiments on ultracold @xmath13 at innsbruck@xcite , a strong",
    ", transversely anisotropic quasi-1d confinement is used to create an initially strongly repulsive ( @xmath0 ) tonks gas .",
    "this is followed by a sudden change in @xmath14-field to a new value , resulting in a molecular loss signature for a resonance which is confinement dependent .",
    "numerous multiple confinement - induced resonances are observed .",
    "there is even an unexpected resonance for @xmath0 in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) limit , which has also been measured using release energy data in fermionic @xmath15 experiments @xcite .",
    "all these observations contradict the harmonic waveguide theory given above .",
    "however , it is important to recognize that the waveguide potential in these experiments are generally anharmonic , so that kohn s theorem does not apply .",
    "hence , there are more degrees of freedom available for excitation , since the com quantum numbers must now be included in the description .",
    "the interesting issue is whether these observed cir effects can be explained as anharmonic ( acir ) resonances due to center - of - mass excitations of resonant bound states@xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig:(color - online)-schematic diagram ] , by the two atoms moving together in ( a ) .",
    "such effects can only occur in an anharmonic trapping environment , which allows coupling between incoming scattering states with zero transverse excitation and an outgoing transverse com excitation .    in another 2d experiment on ultracold @xmath16 at cambridge@xcite ,",
    "a cir resonance occurs on the attractive side of a feshbach resonance , as expected .",
    "this experiment has a much lower anharmonicity than the innsbruck experiment .",
    "it also uses a different technique to identify the resonance , employing rf spectroscopy rather than molecular losses .",
    "thus , there are distinct resonance signatures used in the two published experiments",
    ". the cambridge data appears to show evidence for anomalous resonance features on the @xmath0 side of the feshbach resonance , but this effect is greatly reduced compared to the innsbruck observations .",
    "all feshbach bound states have a bound molecular fraction@xcite in which the atoms have a small separation .",
    "we conjecture that this molecular fraction is larger for com acir resonances ( a ) , where the atoms are in a relative ground state - compared to internally excited hcir resonances ( b ) , where the atoms are in a relative excited state .",
    "this would mean that com excitations would have a relatively larger 3-body recombination loss due to molecule formation .",
    "this is precisely the signature of the resonances used in the innsbruck experiments .",
    "rf spectroscopy , used in the cambridge experiments , on the other hand has different characteristics .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to expect the two experiments to have a different relative sensitivity to internal and com molecular resonances .",
    "for technical reasons explained below , current cir experiments typically involve an anharmonic confinement mechanism . in such cases ,",
    "the excitation of a com degree of freedom can be coupled to input states with no transverse com excitation .",
    "this coupling mechanism would explain observed anomalies such as multiple resonances , different to those predicted using the standard parabolic confinement theory .",
    "there are three possibilities which might allow resonant coupling to additional confinement induced bound - states through nonlinear mechanisms :    1 .",
    "the kohn theorem only applies for parabolic confinement .",
    "experimentally the optical confinement is sinusoidal and/or gaussian , not parabolic .",
    "this allows direct coupling to @xmath17 states , or even @xmath18 states , depending on the type of anharmonicity .",
    "2 .   in some experiments",
    "the width of the feshbach resonance is comparable to the separation of the transverse modes , allowing contributions from the molecular bound state channel as well as the atomic channel .",
    "this still requires anharmonic coupling to access bound states having com transverse energy .",
    "3 .   at high density",
    "the mean - field background potentials of the other atoms may provide an anharmonic effective potential which is not parabolic . in such cases",
    ", one may expect the collective oscillation frequencies to play a role .",
    "coupling to com excitations is possible whenever the transverse response is nonlinear , and the potential departs from a parabolic shape .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the ultra - cold atomic physics experiments , which generally involve sinusoidal laser trapping potentials .",
    "these are only approximately parabolic in the strongly confined limit .",
    "it is this possibility of nonlinear cir due to anharmonic confinement which is explained below .",
    "although related theoretical work that has been carried out includes one or the other of these effects , it is important to include _ both _ anisotropy and anharmonicity to fully explain the observed acir resonances .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the simplest model of nonlinear cir , with a single - channel s - wave interatomic potential and an anharmonic trapping potential .",
    "we do not take into account either many - body corrections or explicit molecule formation channels@xcite .",
    "this model is therefore applicable to relatively dilute quantum gases with a broad feshbach resonance . to model the nonlinear cir effect in greater detail ,",
    "consider two atoms with mass @xmath11 which are anisotropically confined in the transverse direction , and can almost freely move in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "such a model can treat both a quasi-1d and quasi-2d experiment , by taking one of the trapping frequencies to zero .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two atoms in a quasi-1d system is , therefore : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the atomic interaction for s - wave scattering described by a zero - range pseudo - potential with interaction strength @xmath22 corresponding to a scattering length of @xmath2 , and @xmath23 is a single - particle hamiltonian including external potential and kinetic energy terms .      for dipole trapping experiments with 1d and 2d optical lattices ,",
    "the trapping potential near a potential minimum at @xmath24 is due to an optical standing wave of form : @xmath25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath26 are the two orthogonal slowly varying potential energy envelopes of standing waves due to the atomic dipole interactions with the two trapping lasers at optical wavelengths @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 are potential well - depths , leading to trap frequencies @xmath30 in the @xmath31 directions .",
    "we have used a scale length of the reduced oscillator lengths @xmath32 in each direction .",
    "it is also common to use the single atom oscillator length definition of @xmath33 , which we will utilize in comparisons with experiment in later sections .    to next order beyond the linear confinement approximation ,",
    "we have introduced @xmath34 as the dominant anharmonic parameters , so that : @xmath35    for plane waves , these quartic anharmonic terms are the lowest order possible . more generally , the potential may be neither parabolic nor sinusoidal .",
    "examples of this include the potential found in an optical fibre , which can be engineered to any desired shape , and potentials found in experiments using magnetic trapping or focused gaussian beams .",
    "for this reason , we expect cubic , quartic and higher order anharmonic parameters in any real experiment . however , the quartic term given above is due to spatial modulation on optical wavelength scales .",
    "this is generally larger than cubic anharmonic terms like @xmath36 caused by focusing effects .    for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the the dominant anharmonic effects are caused by anharmonic parameters @xmath37 , and the single - particle hamiltonian is : @xmath38 thus , the trapping hamiltonian ( [ eq:1d 1 ] ) has the form of a harmonic hamiltonian @xmath39 plus an anharmonic terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the @xmath42and @xmath43 directions respectively : @xmath44    next , we can estimate typical parameter values in recent experiments , as shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we note that in the innsbruck experiments with relatively large observed anomalies , the dimensionless anharmonic parameter was typically @xmath45 , which is substantially larger than in the case of the cambridge experiment , with an anharmonicity of @xmath46 .",
    "these parameters are calculated for alkali metal atoms , micron wavelength lasers and typical @xmath47 trap frequencies .",
    "obviously , large changes in anharmonicities are easily obtained by changing any of the relevant factors .",
    "these anharmonic parameters lead to energy shifts in the acir resonances , which we calculate below .",
    "more importantly , any type of anharmonic potential allows a coupling between relative and com motion , which is otherwise prohibited due to the kohn theorem .",
    ".typical anharmonic parameters for cir experiments using optical lattices , following data from innsbruck ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and cambridge ( k ) @xcite .",
    "quantitative values depend on the trap frequency , which is varied over a range of values .",
    "[ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we can now make a preliminary estimate of atomic and molecular energies in the two - particle sector , given the anharmonic trapping potential . these estimates assume sufficiently tight internal binding so that only the com energies are changed by the anharmonicity .",
    "while this is not accurate near threshold , it allows an estimate of the size of anharmonic perturbation energies .",
    "it will also be used to check the validity of subsequent results in the tight - binding limit .      for a single particle , the perturbation theory solution including",
    "the anharmonic parameter is well known .",

    "the incoming total energy of two atoms initially in a transverse and longitudinal ground state is therefore : @xmath52    using the numbers in table ( 1 ) , this indicates that the scale of anharmonic energy perturbations should be around @xmath53 of the transverse trap frequency , for the parameters of recent experiments .      in the com relative - coordinate frame , with @xmath54 , @xmath55 ,",

    ", we now consider how the com energy of molecular bound states changes due to anharmonicity . for a broad feshbach resonance , with strong binding",
    "so that the internal molecular energy is not changed by the waveguide , the internal molecular bound state energy in free space for an attractive interaction is known to be : @xmath62 for a tightly bound molecule described only by the com coordinates @xmath63 , the oscillator frequencies are @xmath30 as before . to first order in perturbation theory , the additional com energy @xmath64 of a tightly bound molecular state is therefore : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and : @xmath67+x\\leftrightarrow y\\label{eq : one - molecule - anharmonic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath68 is the single - molecule eigenstate of @xmath39 , again treated as the zero - order wave - function , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the harmonic and anharmonic contributions respectively to the com molecular energy .",
    "the reduced anharmonic correction compared to the free atomic case is due to the reduced spatial width of the wave - function , caused by the increased molecular mass compared to an atom .",

    "a threshold condition in the tight - binding limit is obtained from equating the total ground state transverse energy of two atoms with the total molecular energy in an com excited transverse state .",
    "it will be convenient for later calculations to define a dimensionless bound state energy relative to unbound atoms in a transverse waveguide as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the anisotropy of the two transverse binding frequencies , and @xmath73 in the strong binding limit of interest here .",
    "the correction term of @xmath74 is required to take account of the difference in the transverse confinement energies between the atoms and the molecular state , which does not occur in free space .    after including the anharmonic corrections and excitation energies from eq ( [ eq : one - atom - anharmonic ] ) and eq ( [ eq : one - molecule - anharmonic ] ) , one obtains a resonance condition for _ deeply _ bound molecular acir in an intuitive form as :    @xmath75    on transforming this to dimensionless form , we obtain : @xmath76+\\nonumber \\\\",

    "the results of acir are similar to those of hcir and also agree well with the experiment , as long as the anharmonicity of the confinement is not too large .",
    "due to the broad resonances and fitting techniques used , the isotropic experimental data has too little precision to accurately distinguish between acir and cir resonances .    by increasing the transverse anisotropy @xmath72 , the molecular states @xmath115 and",

    "a splitting of the acir is expected , which has been observed in the experiment .",
    "by contrast , no splitting of the linear hcir resonance is predicted .",
    "thus , the double resonance observed experimentally is a clear signature of the acir resonance .",
    "it is also a sign that if there is any internally excited hcir effect in this experiment , it is relatively suppressed compared to the acir effect which involves com excitations .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the cirs compared with the experimental results @xcite are presented in fig.[fig : the - predictions - unshifted ] .",

    "we follow a similar fitting procedure here , for consistency , but we fit the offset to the isotropic acir prediction instead . note that the anharmonic parameter is different to that used in table [ tab:1 ] , because table [ tab:1 ] gives values representative of a range of experiments , while in each of the figures we use the data from the relevant experiment .    at the point @xmath121 , there is transversely _ isotropic _ confinement , and the acir prediction is in accord with the olshanii cir , apart from anharmonic corrections .",
    "however , as the transverse confinement becomes more and more anisotropic , the internally excited hcir resonance persists as a single resonance except for a small frequency shift @xcite . both acir theory and experiment",
    "show a clear splitting of the original resonance with increasing trap asymmetry .",
    "there is excellent quantitative agreement in the amount of splitting . in these experiments , there is strong evidence for the com excited acir resonances .",
    "as the transverse anisotropy @xmath122 becomes even larger , the energy spacing in the @xmath43 direction decreases , and more transversely excited molecular states can readily couple to the initial scattering state .",
    "consequently , more additional com resonances can occur .",
    "by contrast , there is still only one internal hcir resonance predicted no matter how large the transverse anisotropy .",
    "however , several multiple resonances are observed experimentally at large anisotropy . in order to understand these",
    ", we now consider the other transverse states .    as in the previous section ,",
    "given any coupling parameter ( @xmath2 ) , the unperturbed binding energy @xmath90 is determined by eq ( [ eq : dimensionless_energy ] ) , which as an implicit equation involving the integral @xmath123 .",

    "the general form of the resulting anharmonic shifts is derived in the appendix , for arbitrary quartic anharmonic parameters .",
