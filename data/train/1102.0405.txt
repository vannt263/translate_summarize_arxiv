    "extreme - value copulas arise naturally as the possible limits of copulas of component - wise maxima of independent , identically distributed or strongly mixing stationary sequences [ see @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "these copulas provide flexible tools for modeling joint extremes in risk management .",
    "an important application of extreme - value copulas appears in the modeling of data with positive dependence , and in contrast to the more popular class of archimedean copulas they are not symmetric [ see @xcite or @xcite ] .",
    "further applications can be found in @xcite or @xcite among others .",

    "the representation of ( [ 11 ] ) of the extreme - value copula @xmath11 depends only on the one - dimensional function @xmath15 and statistical inference on a bivariate extreme - value copula @xmath11 may now be reduced to inference on its pickands dependence function  @xmath15 .",
    "the problem of estimating pickands dependence function nonparametrically has found considerable attention in the literature .",
    "roughly speaking , there exist two classes of estimators .",
    "the classical nonparametric estimator is that of @xcite [ see @xcite for its asymptotic properties ] and several variants have been discussed .",
    "alternative estimators have been proposed and investigated in the papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the last - named authors also discussed the multivariate case . in most references ,",
    "the estimators of pickands dependence function are constructed assuming knowledge of the marginal distributions .",
    "recently @xcite proposed rank - based versions of the estimators of @xcite and @xcite , which do not require knowledge of the marginal distributions . in general , all of these estimators are neither convex nor do they satisfy the boundary restriction @xmath16 , in particular the endpoint constrains @xmath17 . however , the estimators can be modified without changing their asymptotic properties in such a way that these constraints are satisfied , see , for example ,  @xcite.=-1    before the specific model of an extreme - value copula is selected , it is necessary to check this assumption by a statistical test , that is a test for the hypotheses @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the class of all copulas satisfying ( [ 11 ] ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "we call ( [ hypextr ] ) the hypothesis of extreme - value dependence",
    ". the problem of testing this hypothesis has found much less attention in the literature . to our best knowledge ,",
    "only two tests of extremeness are currently available in the literature .",
    "the first one was proposed by @xcite .",
    "it exploits the fact that for an extreme - value copula the random variable @xmath20 satisfies the identity @xmath21 - 9 \\mathbb{e}[w^2 ] = 0.\\ ] ] the properties of this test have been studied by @xcite , who determined the finite- and large - sample variance of the test statistic . in particular , the test proposed by @xcite is not consistent against alternatives satisfying ( [ how ] ) .",
    "the second class of tests was recently introduced by @xcite who proposed to compare the empirical copula and a copula estimator which is constructed from the estimators proposed by @xcite under the assumption of an extreme - value copula .",
    "these tests are only consistent against alternatives that are left tail decreasing in both arguments and satisfy strong smoothness assumptions on the copula and convexity assumptions on an analogue of pickands dependence function , which are hard to verify analytically .",
    "the present paper has two purposes .",
    "the first is the development of some alternative estimators of pickands dependence function using the principle of minimum distance estimation .",
    "we propose to consider the best approximation of the logarithm of the empirical copula @xmath22 evaluated in the point @xmath23 , that is , @xmath24 , by functions of the form @xmath25 with respect to a weighted @xmath1-distance .",
    "it turns out that the minimal distance and the corresponding optimal function can be determined explicitly . on the basis of this result , and by choosing various weight functions in the @xmath1-distance , we obtain an infinite - dimensional class of estimators for the function @xmath15 .",
    "our approach is closely related to the theory of @xmath26-estimation and in section [ secmindist ] we indicate how this point of view provides several interesting relationships between the different concepts for constructing estimates of pickands dependence function .",
    "the second purpose of the paper is to present a new test for the hypothesis of extreme - value dependence , which is consistent against a much broader class of alternatives than the tests which have been proposed so far . here",
    "our approach is based on an estimator of a weighted minimum @xmath1-distance between the true copula and the class of functions satisfying ( [ 12 ] ) and the corresponding tests are consistent with respect to all positive quadrant dependent alternatives satisfying weak differentiability assumptions of first order . to our best knowledge , this method provides the first test in this context which is consistent against such a general class of alternatives .",
    "moreover , in contrast to @xcite and @xcite we also provide a weak convergence result under fixed alternative which can be used for studying the power of the test .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secevd ] , we consider the approximation problem from a theoretical point of view .",
    "in particular , we derive explicit representations for the minimal @xmath1-distance between the logarithm of the copula and its best approximation by a function of the form ( [ 12 ] ) , which will be the basis for all statistical applications in this paper .",
    "the new estimators , say @xmath27 , are defined in section [ secmindist ] , where we also prove weak convergence of the process @xmath28}$ ] in the space of uniformly bounded functions on the interval @xmath29 $ ] under appropriate assumptions on the weight function used in the @xmath1-distance .",
    "furthermore , we give a theoretical and empirical comparison of the new estimators with the estimators proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will also determine `` optimal '' estimators in the proposed class by minimizing the asymptotic mse with respect to the choice of the weight function used in the @xmath1-distance .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that some of the new estimators have a substantially smaller asymptotic variance than the estimators proposed by the last - named authors .",
    "we also provide a simulation study in order to investigate the finite sample properties of the different estimates . in section [ sectestevd ] , we introduce and investigate the new test of extreme - value dependence .",
    "in particular , we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis as well as under the alternative . in order to approximate the critical values of the test",
