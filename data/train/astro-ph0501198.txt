    "those spanning the thickness of the disk as in figure  [ fig:3up ] show the overall cooling effects of the instabilities , while calculations of small patches of the surface layers are used for higher - resolution studies that are compared with analytic results .",
    "the timestep in the surface - layer calculations is limited by the diffusion step @xmath29 .",
    "the diffusion step is approximately the time for radiation to diffuse across the lowest - density grid zone , and depends on the grid spacing @xmath30 , number of spatial dimensions @xmath31 , and domain - maximum radiation diffusion coefficient @xmath32 .",
    "the numerical method is stable with longer timesteps due to the implicit differencing scheme used for the radiation source terms .",
    "however in calculations with longer steps , well - resolved short - wavelength linear photon bubble modes grow slower than expected ( section  [ sec : pbitau ] ) .",
    "execution times depend on the number of grid zones and the number of timesteps . with the timestep limited by diffusion , execution times are proportional to @xmath33 in 2-d and @xmath34 in 3-d calculations , so that high resolutions are obtained at considerable expense .",
    "the domain for the calculations spanning the disk thickness is two orders of magnitude larger than the surface - layer patches and the diffusion timestep set by the initial minimum density is 30 times shorter .",
    "results are obtained in a reasonable amount of computer time by allowing timesteps up to @xmath35 . while accuracy is sacrificed in the outermost layers , the timesteps are initially shorter than the time for photons to diffuse across grid zones within @xmath36 of the midplane , where the densities are more than 100 times the minimum .",
    "extremely low densities and short timesteps are prevented in the full - disk - thickness calculations using a density floor .",
    "gas is added to the grid where needed to bring the density up to 0.1% of the initial value at the midplane .",
    "the floor is not reached until significant evolution has occurred , at 2.82  orbits in the diffusion calculation , 2.05  orbits in the convection calculation and 0.76  orbits in the photon bubble calculation . in the calculations of the surface layer patches ,",
    "no floor is applied and densities are allowed to become arbitrarily small .",
    "the initial states for the calculations shown in figure  [ fig:3up ] are taken from a standard shakura - sunyaev model .",
    "the structure is in hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative balance , and heat is assumed to be deposited at a rate proportional to the density at each height .",
    "the construction of the initial condition is described below in section  [ sec : hsefb ] , and the initial state is shown in figure  [ fig : ic ] .",
    "the disk interior is radiation - supported and the half - thickness @xmath37 is set by the surface radiation flux @xmath38 .",
    "characteristic speeds are the radiation sound speed @xmath39 and isothermal gas sound speed @xmath40 .",
    "characteristic scales for disturbances are obtained by matching the corresponding pressure gradients to the gravity .",
    "the radiation pressure scale height @xmath41 is roughly equal to @xmath42 and the gas pressure scale height , @xmath43 , is shorter by @xmath44 times the ratio of radiation to gas pressure .",
    "the ratio of the pressures is  275 at the midplane so that the ratio of the two pressure scale heights is  367 .",
    "the density in the disk interior is almost uniform .",
    "the radiation flux increases linearly with height and the radiation force balances the vertical component of gravity .",
    "the time for radiation to diffuse from the midplane to a height @xmath42 is @xmath45  orbits or eight orbits . in the disk surface layers , densities are lower , so the flux varies little with height and gas pressure provides the extra support needed for hydrostatic balance .",
    "the thickness of the gas pressure supported surface layer is approximately @xmath46 and photons diffuse through this layer in about 0.01  orbit , much shorter than the gas sound crossing time @xmath47  orbit .",
    "gas and radiation reach thermal equilibrium through emission and absorption of photons in a time @xmath48 ranging from @xmath49  orbits at the midplane to @xmath50  orbits at the lowest densities , so we choose to place the entire domain initially in thermal equilibrium . the total optical depth through",
    "the disk is 9200 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the full - disk - thickness calculations are discussed in section  [ sec : bc ] .",
    "the initial and boundary conditions for the calculations in small patches of the surface layers are described in section  [ sec : icsurface ] .",
    "the initial condition is constructed by vertically integrating the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative balance , assuming that the dissipation rate is proportional to the density , that gas and radiation are in thermal equilibrium , and that the radiation diffusion approximation holds .",
    "the integration runs from midplane to outer boundary .",
    "the midplane density is chosen so that the surface density matches the shakura - sunyaev model , and the midplane radiation pressure is chosen so the vertically - integrated accretion stress matches the assumed accretion rate @xmath51 .",
    "the procedure in detail is as follows .",
    "the radial structure of the shakura - sunyaev model is used to determine the surface mass density , @xmath52 and the flux through each face of the disk , @xmath53 the eddington luminosity @xmath54 in equation  [ eqn : sigma ] is the value for which outward radiation forces balance the gravity of the black hole in spherical symmetry .",
    "the factor @xmath55 occurs because the accretion stress is assumed to approach zero at the disk inner edge , @xmath56 , placed at @xmath57 .",
    "the choice of conditions at the inner edge is expected to have little effect on the outcome of the calculations at @xmath58 . given the surface density and flux , the vertical structure is completely specified by the vertical component of the equation of motion @xmath59 and the summed gas and radiation energy equations @xmath60 together with boundary values for density and temperature .",
    "equations  [ eqn : hse ] and  [ eqn : fb ] are integrated simultaneously from the midplane outward .",
    "the midplane density @xmath61 is chosen so that the surface density of the resulting structure is @xmath62 .",
    "the surface density is measured between the top and bottom surfaces of the disk at optical depth unity .",
    "the midplane temperature is adjusted until the height - integrated accretion stress is sufficient to produce the accretion rate , so that @xmath63 as with the surface density , the vertical integration extends to the surfaces of unit optical depth .",
    "the initial state is constructed assuming eddington factors of one - third throughout .",
    "this is inaccurate above the photosphere , where the specific intensity is expected to be greater looking down than up .",
    "direct integration of the transfer equation indicates that the eddington factor at zero optical depth is  0.42 .",
    "the smaller eddington factor used corresponds to shallower gradients in radiation energy density and higher temperatures near the photosphere .",
    "the higher temperatures lead to slower growth of photon bubbles in the disk surface layers , as the fastest growth rates are proportional to @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "our calculations therefore place a lower bound on the growth rates of photon bubbles in the shakura - sunyaev model .",
    "gas , magnetic fields , and radiation are allowed to flow out through the upper and lower boundaries of the full - disk - thickness calculations , and radiation is allowed also to diffuse out .",
    "the gradients of gas temperature and density across the boundaries are set to zero .",
    "the vertical velocity is restricted to zero or outward values , so that gas may flow out , but not in . the outflow boundary condition on the magnetic field",
    "is imposed through the electromotive force ( emf ) .",
    "the gradient in the emf is zero across the boundary @xcite .",
    "radiation energy densities outside the domain are chosen so that the flux across the boundary is approximately equal to the flux between the outermost pair of active zones .",
    "the fluxes are calculated using the diffusion coefficients obtained in the previous timestep , so that the boundary condition corresponds exactly to @xmath65 only when the flow is time - independent .",
    "should the flux be directed into the domain , the radiation energy densities outside are chosen to make the flux zero , preventing radiation from entering .",
    "the side boundaries are periodic .",
    "the domain for the calculations of the disk surface layers extends from 0.95 to @xmath66 above the midplane .",
    "the initial conditions for these calculations are constructed assuming no dissipation occurs within the domain , so the flux is independent of height .",
    "the resulting structure has density gradients slightly steeper than the corresponding region in the calculations spanning the whole disk thickness .",
    "the temperature and density at the height in the full vertical structure that corresponds to the center of the smaller domain are used as starting conditions for the integration of the hydrostatic equilibrium and flux balance equations , [ eqn : hse ] and [ eqn : fb ] .",
    "the flux throughout is set to the value at the height corresponding to the bottom of the surface layer domain and the dissipation term on the right - hand side of equation  [ eqn : fb ] is zero .",
    "the vertical integration is first performed assuming that the opacity is due to electron scattering alone .",
    "a more accurate equilibrium is obtained with a second integration , including free - free opacities calculated using the temperatures and densities resulting from the first approximation .",
    "the resulting structure when placed in a 1-d vertical radiation hydrodynamic calculation shows residual motions initially less than @xmath67 times the radiation acoustic speed , and decreasing or constant over 10  orbits .",
    "the structure is convectively stable , with radiation and gas brunt - visl frequencies ranging from 1.17 and @xmath68 at the lower boundary to 7.19 and @xmath69 at the top .",
    "the total optical depth is 287 .",
    "characteristic lengths are the density scale height @xmath70 and the gas pressure scale height @xmath43 .",
    "the density scale height ranges from @xmath71 at the bottom boundary to @xmath72 at the top , and the density declines by a factor 14 or @xmath73 @xmath74-foldings over the height of the surface layer patch .",
    "the gas pressure scale height is the longest distance over which gas pressure disturbances can balance gravity .",
    "it depends on the temperature and gravity , which are almost uniform over the domain .",
    "the gas pressure scale height is @xmath75 at domain bottom , @xmath76 at center and @xmath77 at top .",
    "the ratio of radiation to gas pressure ranges from 121 at the lower boundary to 1500 at the top , and at domain center @xmath78 the ratio is 254 . at the lower boundary in the surface layer calculations ,",
    "the temperature and density are fixed at their initial values , and the vertical velocity is zero .",
    "the fixed temperature means that the supply of radiation energy diffusing into the patch from below is inexhaustible .",
    "the side and top boundaries are treated as in the calculations spanning the disk thickness .",
    "radiation - dominated shakura - sunyaev equilibria are convectively unstable @xcite , with the fastest modes growing at about the orbital frequency @xcite .",
    "greatest convective instability in the initial condition for the calculations in figure  [ fig:3up ] occurs a little below the disk surface , at @xmath79 , as shown in figure  [ fig : ic ] , lower left panel .",
    "growth begins in the numerical calculations from initial random 1% density perturbations applied within @xmath80 of the midplane , where the density is greater than half the midplane value .",
    "growth rates during the linear stage are measured using fourier power spectra of the horizontal velocities in a square region spanning the domain width @xmath81 and extending from @xmath82 to @xmath83 above the midplane .",
    "the fastest mode has horizontal and vertical wavelengths 0.2 and @xmath81 and grows at @xmath84 .",
    "the fastest mode in the corresponding region below the midplane has horizontal and vertical wavelengths 0.13 and @xmath81 and grows at @xmath85 .",
    "these fastest modes are well - resolved , with 40 or more grid zones per wavelength . among the solutions of the local linear dispersion relation , @xcite equation  49 ,",
    "the same two wavevectors grow fastest .",
    "the analytic growth rates of both modes peak at height @xmath86 , where the rates are approximately equal and are @xmath87 . at the upper boundary of the measurement region at @xmath83",
    "there is convective stability , while at the lower boundary at @xmath88 , the dispersion relation indicates both modes grow at @xmath89 .",
    "the differences between the fastest modes in the numerical and analytic solutions are much less than the range in local analytic growth rates across the region .",
    "the wkb approximation is marginally applicable to the fastest modes , as the radiation pressure at the top of the region is 1.7 times less than at the bottom .",
    "nevertheless the wkb solutions and the numerical results are consistent .",
    "once the disturbances reach non - linear amplitudes in the convection calculation , overdense gas falls toward the midplane and underdense material rises toward the vertical boundaries .",
    "radiation is carried with the rising gas , leading to an overall increase in the cooling rate ( figure  [ fig : cool ] ) .",
    "the mean cooling rate between 2.25 and 3.25  orbits is 1.6  times that in the diffusion calculation .",
    "the horizontally - averaged ram pressure of the motions is greater than the gas pressure and less than the radiation pressure .",
    "the horizontal separation between dense sinking plumes of gas is about equal to the domain width , so we check whether cooling is limited by the width using a version with the horizontal size doubled and the number of zones in the horizontal direction increased to 256 .",
    "the cooling rate is similar and the radiation energy falls to half its initial value in 2.1  orbits .",
    "results of a linear stability analysis indicate that unmagnetized electron - scattering atmospheres transmitting a flux greater than about half the local eddington limit are subject to two instabilities driven by the rapid diffusion of radiation with respect to the gas @xcite .",
    "the analysis is 2-d , and is local in the horizontal direction and global in the vertical direction .",
    "the temperature and gravity used by shaviv are appropriate to a white dwarf envelope during a nova outburst .",
    "the first of the modes , type  i , is stationary , with density and radiation pressure disturbances anticorrelated , and was seen only in calculations with fixed - temperature lower boundary .",
    "its growth time is similar to the time for gas sound waves to cross the density scale height .",
    "the second mode , type  ii , is propagating , with a phase lag between density and radiation pressure disturbances , and appears in calculations with a variety of boundary conditions .",
    "its growth is an order of magnitude slower .",
    "we search for growing radiation hydrodynamical modes of the surface layers of the disk model shown in figure  [ fig : ic ] , using numerical calculations without magnetic fields .",
    "the domain extends from @xmath90 to @xmath66 above the midplane , as described in section  [ sec : icsurface ] . in the first series of calculations , the domain width is equal to the height and symmetry is assumed along the third dimension .",
    "initial density perturbations are applied in the middle half of the domain height .",
    "the perturbation in each grid zone is random , with probability uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath91 . during the calculations an exponentially - growing mode appears .",
    "the horizontal variation can be represented by a single fourier component with wavelength equal to the domain width while the vertical variation is the sum of several fourier components having growth rates identical within the time fluctuations , indicating the mode is global .",
    "the instability occurs when low density at one location near the bottom boundary leads to a larger radiation flux , which drives material up and away from the boundary , further reducing the density . in regions of higher density to either side , gas falls , producing an overturning pattern shown in figure  [ fig : overturn ] .",
    "the pattern is stationary and grows in place .",
    "it is localized near the bottom boundary and its amplitude decreases sharply with height .",
    "density and radiation pressure are approximately anticorrelated .",
    "the largest positive density and negative radiation pressure perturbations lie at the same horizontal position , but the radiation pressure extremum is offset higher by  0.05 density scale height . when the disturbance reaches non - linear amplitudes , the rising gas forms an evacuated chimney in which the flux is greater than the surroundings .",
    "the horizontally - averaged flux at the last time shown in figure  [ fig : overturn ] is 4.6 times the flux in the initial hydrostatic atmosphere .",
    "material is lost quickly through the chimney , and the total mass in the domain decreases 4% during the 0.01  orbits before the last time shown .",
    "the chimney structure may prove to disrupt the layer in which it forms .",
    "radiation diffusion is required for instability , as no growth is seen in an otherwise identical calculation with the diffusion term @xmath92 in equation  [ eqn : eoer ] omitted .",
    "the variation of the instability with horizontal wavelength is checked using calculations in a wider domain .",
    "the width is increased fourfold to @xmath81 and several modes with global vertical patterns grow exponentially .",
    "the dependence of growth rate on horizontal wavenumber and numerical resolution is shown in figure  [ fig : shavivispectrum ] .",
    "the fastest modes have horizontal wavelengths roughly @xmath93 .",
    "growth rates increase with numerical resolution , so we have not achieved numerical convergence .",
    "the first null in horizontal velocity lies 2  grid zones above the bottom boundary in the calculations with 32 zones in the height , and 3 , 6 and 12  zones above the boundary in the calculations with 64 , 128 and 256 zones in the height , respectively ; the pattern is poorly resolved on the coarser grids .",
    "like the type  i instability , the overturning modes grow fastest at intermediate horizontal wavenumbers , and are stable for @xmath94 and @xmath95 large . in the linear analysis by @xcite ,",
    "the fastest modes have horizontal wavelengths roughly @xmath96 times the density scale height and growth rates comparable to the ratio of gas sound speed to density scale height . in the present calculations these correspond to horizontal wavenumber @xmath97 and growth rate @xmath98 at domain center .",
    "the growth rate and wavenumber increase with the eddington ratio @xmath99 up to the largest value 0.9 examined by @xcite .",
    "the eddington ratio at domain center in our calculations is 0.94 and the wavenumber and growth rate of the fastest mode are greater than those estimated by shaviv .",
    "instability in three dimensions is tested using a single calculation at the same location , with the volume of @xmath100 divided into @xmath101 zones .",
    "the fastest - growing mode is again an overturning pattern that is global in the vertical direction , with wavelengths along both horizontal axes equal to the domain size .",
    "its linear growth rate @xmath102 is the same within the amplitude of small time variations as the fastest mode in the 2-d calculation of the same domain width and resolution .",
    "the gas motions soon after the development of a chimney structure are shown in figure  [ fig : chimney ] .",
    "the overturning instability appears to be of the first type described by @xcite .",
    "both are local in the horizontal and global in the vertical direction ; require radiation diffusion ; have density and radiation pressure perturbations stationary and anti - correlated ; and grow fastest at about the gas sound crossing rate for wavelengths comparable to the density scale height .",
    "the instability is vigorous in our disk surface layer calculations , growing faster than the orbital frequency .",
    "disturbances reaching non - linear amplitudes develop into narrow chimneys of low - density gas moving rapidly upwards , separated by larger regions of denser down - welling material .",
    "radiation escapes readily through the chimneys .",
    "no shaviv type  i modes are observed in the convection calculation shown in figure  [ fig:3up ] where the spatial resolution matches that in the surface - layer calculation with @xmath103 zones .",
    "the type  i modes may require a lower boundary of fixed temperature , and if this is so they are unlikely to play a major role in cooling radiation - dominated accretion disks .",
    "the modes could be important in situations where a radiation - supported atmosphere lies above a thermal conductivity discontinuity , as in accreting , weakly - magnetized neutron stars and in high - mass stars with internal composition boundaries .",
    "no modes resembling shaviv s slower - growing type  ii instability were found in our calculations .",
    "the absence may be due to differences including our lower temperature and density , smaller gravity that increases with height , and greater optical depth .",
    "unlike convection and the overturning modes , photon bubbles require magnetic fields .",
    "the source of free energy for photon bubble instability is the gradient in radiation pressure that supports the disk against gravity in the vertical direction .",
    "instability occurs when density disturbances lead to flux perturbations having a component parallel to the magnetic field . the greater flux in regions of low density accelerates gas out of these regions along field lines , leading to an increase in the density contrast with time as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mechanism ] .",
    "a mathematical justification for this picture is presented in the appendix",
    ". when magnetic fields are absent , compressional motions are purely longitudinal in the short - wavelength limit .",
    "sound waves displace the gas along the wavevector and perpendicular to the flux perturbations , so there is no net acceleration over a wave period and no instability .    in this section",
    "we look at the exponential growth of small - amplitude photon bubbles .",
    "the growth rate varies with the wavelength , the direction of propagation and the magnetic field strength and orientation",
    ". however the growth rate is independent of field strength for magnetic pressures greater than the gas pressure .",
    "furthermore the fastest modes have wavelengths shorter than @xmath96 times the gas pressure scale height but long enough to be optically - thick , and over this range the growth rate varies slowly with wavelength .",
    "the fastest growth occurs when the wavefronts and the fields are close to the vertical but tilted slightly with respect to one another .",
    "we compare the photon bubble growth against the predictions of @xcite .",
    "they carried out a wkb plane - wave analysis , treating the radiation field in the eddington approximation and found that photon bubbles in the limit of short wavelengths are unstable slow magnetosonic waves .",
    "the growth rate increases with wavenumber for fixed propagation direction , approaching an asymptote at wavenumbers greater than the inverse gas pressure scale height @xmath104 if the gas and radiation reach thermal equilibrium in much less than a wave period .",
    "the comparison is made using the same patch of the disk surface layers as in section  [ sec : shavivi ] . in the first set of 2-d calculations , the magnetic field is initially uniform and horizontal .",
    "the field strength is chosen so the magnetic pressure is 10% of the midplane radiation pressure , or 25% of the radiation pressure at the center of the surface layer patch . because the group velocity is nearly parallel to the field , unstable waves arising near domain center propagate many times across the width , taking more than 10  orbits to reach the upper or lower boundary .",

    "growth slows at 0.9  orbits , when densities range from half to twice their initial values . during the second phase ,",
    "shocks merge because gas accelerated through the low - density regions reaches lower speeds if the fronts are closer together .",

    "the horizontal distance between shocks in units of the gas pressure scale height is @xmath145 and the enhancement in the vertical component of the flux in the limit of strong magnetic fields becomes @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the ratio of the maximum density to the mean and @xmath148 is the angle between the magnetic field and the horizontal .",
    "the ratio @xmath149 of the minimum density to the mean is expected to equal @xmath150 .",

    "the pattern is reduced in strength near the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "also , the shocks are spread over several grid zones in the fiducial calculation for numerical stability , while in the analytic solution the shocks are arbitrarily thin .",
    "similar profiles are found on other rays perpendicular to the fronts .",
    "the agreement in the fiducial calculation is better than in a version with a coarser grid of @xmath128 zones , indicating that some of the departure from the analytic solution is due to the limited spatial resolution . at earlier times during the shock merger phase in the fiducial run ,",

    "the relationship between overdensity and shock separation in the numerical calculation agrees well with the analytic expectation except near the start and end of the calculation .",
    "near the start , the front spacing is overestimated because the small - amplitude waves have density maxima offset by a quarter - wavelength from the locations of fastest compression and are missed from the count . near the end , the analytic assumptions of straight magnetic field lines and time - averaged hydrostatic equilibrium no longer hold .",
    "the radiation flux in the fiducial calculation is shown as a function of the overdensity in figure  [ fig : shockflux ] .",
    "the vertical component of the flux in the frame co - moving with the gas is averaged along a horizontal line passing through domain center , and plotted in units of the flux in the initial hydrostatic atmosphere .",
    "the overdensity is the maximum ratio of the density to the initial density on the same horizontal line .",
    "each plotted point marks a measurement from one snapshot in the fiducial calculation , while a dotted curve shows the analytic estimate from equation  [ eqn : ell ] .",
    "the two solutions agree well until the shock spacing approaches the density scale height , violating the analytic assumption that the background quantities vary little over a wavelength .",
    "the flux in the numerical calculation is then greater , but increases with overdensity at about the same rate as in the analytic solution . during the final 0.07  orbits ,",
    "fluxes become much greater than in the analytic solution as the magnetic fields buckle and gas is ejected through the top boundary .",
    "shocks grow in the fiducial calculation until the pattern is disrupted by buckling of the magnetic field .",
    "however in three dimensions , the field provides stiffness only along one horizontal axis , and variations along the other horizontal direction could destroy the shock pattern at an earlier stage . a three - dimensional version of the fiducial calculation is made by extending the domain along the third or @xmath10-axis to make a cube of volume @xmath100 divided into @xmath101 zones .",

    "the pattern grows rapidly and vertical speeds exceed the gas sound speed after 1.62  orbits .",
    "the rising gas penetrates the overlying shock pattern , disrupting it by 1.89  orbits .",
    "the secondary instability resembles the shaviv type i instability in that overturning motions lead to the growth of low - density chimneys of rising material , but differs in that the horizontal wavelength is six times shorter .",
    "the secondary instability might be a form of the two - dimensional type  i instability modified by the shear @xmath151 and if that is the case , may also require a special lower boundary condition .",
    "the magnetic field orientation affects the growth rate and propagation direction of the fastest photon bubble mode ( section  [ sec : linear ] ) and therefore how quickly shocks develop and at what angle they first appear .",
    "the orientation of the field is varied in a series of calculations with @xmath128 zones that are otherwise identical to the fiducial surface - layer run of section  [ sec : shockfiducial ] . on horizontal fields , modes propagating to left and right",

    "is accelerated upward by the radiation force , leaving behind extremely low densities .",
    "the corresponding large fluxes lead to bending of the field and disruption of the pattern .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field affects the shocks through field line bending .",
    "a series of surface - layer calculations was made with fields having different strengths but a common inclination of 3  degrees .",
    "the initial magnetic pressures are 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100% of the radiation pressure at domain center or 0.254 to 254 times the domain - center gas pressure .",
    "a snapshot from each calculation is shown in figure  [ fig : shockpmag ] .",
    "the results are described below and may be compared with the fiducial calculation , where the magnetic pressure is 25% of the domain - center radiation pressure .    1 .   in the weakest - field case , the first instabilities reaching non - linear amplitudes are photon bubbles in the upper two - thirds of the domain and the shaviv type  i overturn instability in the lower one - third .",
    "the magnetic fields are bent by gas pressure gradient and radiation forces when the disturbances reach non - linear amplitudes . at 0.6  orbits , the largest density variations due to photon bubbles are 5% , those due to the overturn instability are 9% and the field inclination ranges seven degrees either side of its starting value . at 0.8  orbits the speeds due to the photon bubbles approach the gas sound speed .",
    "the evolution after 0.8  orbits is dominated by a vertical chimney of rising , low - density gas that develops from the overturn instability and pushes aside the magnetic fields and weak shock train .",
    "2 .   in the case with magnetic pressure 1% of the domain - center radiation pressure ,",
    "field lines are first bent by more than five degrees at 0.7  orbits , when the largest ram pressure , @xmath152 dyn @xmath153 , is still much less than the magnetic and gas pressures at the same location , @xmath154 and @xmath155 dyn @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "the forces bending the field lines are roughly equal parts due to the flux perturbations and gas pressure gradients from the density variations in the photon bubbles .",
    "gas collects near shock fronts at inflection points in the field lines , further increasing the density contrast which reaches a factor five at one orbit .",
    "the low - density gas is then driven up parallel to the shock fronts by the radiation force and regions near the bottom boundary are evacuated .",

    "the ram pressure of the gas is everywhere less than 5% of the magnetic pressure . from 1.6  orbits on , the horizontal distance between fronts is equal to the domain width and the shock pattern varies slowly due to the vertical gradient in the propagation speed .",
    "overdense gas moving down field lines near the lower boundary rises again only with difficulty , because the vertical velocity is fixed at zero on the boundary .",
    "material gradually accumulates near the bottom and the calculation is ended after the horizontally - averaged density at domain center falls below half the initial value .    in summary ,",
    "photon bubbles lead to shock trains over the whole range of field strengths explored .",
    "the shock amplitude is limited by the growth of the overturning instability in the case with magnetic pressure less than gas pressure , by the strength of the magnetic field in the two intermediate cases and by the size of the domain in the calculation with the strongest fields .",
    "photon bubbles saturate at low amplitudes in a calculation centered on the disk photosphere at @xmath156 .",

    "eddington factors depart slightly from one - third in regions of low density near the photosphere and the results may depend on the angular variation of the radiation intensity .",
    "more detailed calculations in this regime may be useful to test the accuracy of the relationship between the radiation energy gradient and the anisotropy assumed in our flux - limited diffusion calculation .",

    "density disturbances exceed 10% after 0.18  orbits and the photon bubbles develop into trains of shocks .",
    "the shock fronts are curved because the wavevector of the fastest - growing linear mode varies with height , being more nearly parallel to the magnetic field in the disk interior .",
    "the relationship between flux and overdensity at @xmath78 is consistent with the improved analytic shock train solution until 0.48  orbits .",

    "a further 0.7% of the initial mass is ejected through the channels by 1.5  orbits , when the total radiation energy has fallen by 94% and the calculation is ended .",
    "the declining fluxes in the later stages are not sufficient to support the overdense gas in the surface layers and the dense material collapses toward the midplane .",
    "the timestep in the calculation shown in figure  [ fig:3up ] is 100  times the diffusion step determined by the lowest densities .",
    "the effects of the timestep are checked using a version with steps ten times shorter that is run for one orbit .",
    "linear photon bubble growth rates are similar and the same fastest mode grows at @xmath161 . owing to a more accurate rise in the radiation energy outside the photosphere in response to increased fluxes inside , a smaller fraction of the surface layers is ejected and the mass decreases by only 1.2% up to 0.7  orbits .",
    "the mean cooling rate between 0.7 and 1.0  orbits is slightly faster than in the calculation with longer timesteps , at 5.9  times the rate in the calculation with diffusion alone .",

    ". however the effects of the photon bubbles are underestimated in both calculations because the longest wavelength of rapid linear growth , @xmath162 , is marginally resolved in the surface layers .",
    "faster linear growth at short wavelengths is indicated by the wkb analysis and measured in the higher - resolution calculation described in section  [ sec : pbifast ] .",
    "the dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field is examined with two additional calculations extending through the disk thickness .",
    "the only parameter differing from figure  [ fig:3up ] is the initial inclination of the field .",
    "the field is horizontal in one case and inclined 45  degrees in the other .",
    "results at the times when horizontal density variations first exceed a factor ten are shown in figure  [ fig : density10 ] with a corresponding view of the case from figure  [ fig:3up ] having the field inclined 87  degrees .",
    "the times shown are 1.22 , 0.72 and 0.33  orbits , respectively .",
    "as expected from the linear analysis , the development is fastest on near - vertical fields .",
    "the effects of the photon bubbles are also large in the case with the intermediate inclination , where modes with fronts tilted to the same side as the field grow much faster than those with fronts tilted the other way and long , unobstructed channels of low density are formed .",
    "the largest radiation flux is 30% greater than at the same density contrast in the case from figure  [ fig:3up ] .",
    "the shock spacing and amplitude and the gas speeds continue to grow until at 0.94  orbits the ram pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure at some locations and the field lines are bent .",
    "gas collects near the inflection points in the field and slides down the field lines under its own weight , disrupting the shock pattern in the interior but leaving a regular train of fronts in the surface layers .",
    "the calculation is ended at 1.2  orbits . in the case with horizontal field ,",
    "shock mergers by 1.5  orbits increase the horizontal spacing of the fronts to @xmath93 at height @xmath78 .",
    "the maximum fluxes at this time are twice the initial photospheric flux .",
    "the radiation force then drives off the outer layers where no perturbations were placed initially . by the end of the calculation at 1.8  orbits , 13% of the mass",
    "is lost through the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "we study the cooling of radiation - pressure dominated accretion disks due to convection and the shaviv type  i and photon bubble instabilities , using 2-d and 3-d radiation - mhd calculations of small patches of disk .",
    "the background conditions are simplified by neglecting differential rotation , so the turbulence and heating resulting from mri are absent .",
    "the initial states are chosen from a shakura - sunyaev model , but no effective viscosity is applied during the calculations .",
    "the cooling caused by the instabilities is compared against the 1-d vertical diffusion that is assumed in the shakura - sunyaev picture .    1 .   in the absence of magnetic fields ,",
    "convective instability grows at about the orbital frequency @xmath163 and cools the disk 60% faster than 1-d diffusion , consistent with previous studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the shaviv type  i global instability is not observed in calculations extending through the disk thickness , but grows quickly in calculations with a closed lower boundary of fixed temperature .",
    "the wavelengths and fastest growth rates agree approximately with those in the linear analysis by @xcite despite different assumptions about the background state .",
    "disturbances reaching large amplitudes become narrow chimneys of rising low - density gas separated by denser , sinking material .",
    "the shaviv type  i instability is unlikely to have strong effects in radiation - dominated disks but may be important in radiation - supported atmospheres with distinct lower boundaries .",
    "photon bubbles with wavelengths shorter than the gas pressure scale height @xmath43 grow faster than the orbital frequency when magnetic pressure exceeds gas pressure , in detailed agreement with a linear wkb analysis .",
    "growth approaches the asymptotic rate @xmath164 expected from the linear analysis , when the field is nearly vertical .",
    "the disturbances develop into trains of propagating shocks similar to those predicted by @xcite .",
    "the shocks grow in strength and increase in separation over time , while radiation escapes through the gaps between , cooling the flow in the case we considered five times faster than assumed in the shakura - sunyaev model .    unlike convection , which is driven by an entropy gradient and",
    "can be absent if heating is concentrated in the surface layers , photon bubbles are driven by the radiation flux .",
    "the photon bubble shoulder wavenumber @xmath104 and the fastest growth rate @xmath165 at the disk surface are determined by the temperature and height of the photosphere .",
    "they are independent of the details of the internal structure and independent of the field strength , provided the magnetic pressure is greater than the gas pressure .",
    "instability is present if the ratio of the flux to the radiation energy density exceeds approximately the isothermal gas sound speed @xmath166 in optically - thick regions having radiation and magnetic pressures greater than the gas pressure @xcite . since the ratio of flux to energy density must approach @xmath167 at the photosphere and @xmath168 , the criterion for linear instability is likely to be satisfied in the outer layers .",
    "a major issue to be resolved is the amplitudes reached by photon bubbles in turbulence driven by the mri , where structures are destroyed on the eddy turnover timescale of about an orbit .",
    "photon bubble growth rates depend on the orientation of the magnetic fields .",
    "the fields in mri turbulence have a small mean vertical component in 3-d shearing - box mhd calculations of patches of accretion disk neglecting radiation diffusion @xcite , and the median angle between magnetic field and midplane is @xmath160 in a calculation including diffusion @xcite . on fields with similar inclinations in the calculations described in section  [ sec :",
    "linear ] , photon bubbles grow faster than @xmath169 , corresponding to an increase in amplitude by a factor @xmath170 per orbit .",
    "the fastest modes in our numerical calculations grow on nearly vertical magnetic fields at @xmath171 , increasing in amplitude by a factor @xmath172 per orbit . given time enough to grow ,",
    "small disturbances develop into trains of shocks that increase in strength and wavelength until the magnetic fields buckle .",
    "the dependence of the linear growth rate on field angle could lead to effects varying in time and space according to the field structures found in the turbulence .",
    "fast photon bubble growth consistent with the asymptotic regime of the linear analysis is found only in calculations with grid spacing less than one - tenth the shoulder wavelength @xmath162 and timestep shorter than the diffusion step . accurately following the growth of photon bubbles throughout the disk thickness for the parameters we chose required a grid of about a thousand zones in the vertical direction .",
    "the grid spacing needed in a shakura - sunyaev disk model is about @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the gas pressure at the photosphere and @xmath175 is the radiation pressure at the midplane .",
    "future advances in computer technology will enable the study of photon bubbles together with the mri using 3-d radiation - mhd calculations on such grids .",
    "the analytic and numerical results indicate that photon bubbles develop into regions of alternating high and low density much smaller than the disk thickness .",
    "radiation escapes faster through the porous flow than through the hydrostatic structure of the same surface density and the resulting cooling may have fundamental effects on the overall thermal balance .",
    "inhomogeneities within a few thomson depths of the photosphere can modify the emitted thermal spectrum @xcite and the reflected x - ray spectrum @xcite while sufficiently rapid cooling could lead to super - eddington luminosities from geometrically thin accretion disks @xcite .",

    "# 1to 0pt#1 = cmbsy10 = cmmib10    as discussed at length in @xcite , there are two basic physical mechanisms for the radiative amplification of traveling acoustic waves .",
    "the first relies on an interaction between the background radiative flux @xmath176 and fluctuations in the flux mean ( rosseland ) opacity @xmath177 in the wave , and exists even in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "this mechanism is irrelevant for the conditions we consider in this paper , where the flux mean opacity is dominated by thomson scattering , and is therefore constant .",
    "the second mechanism originates from a breakdown in cancellation of background radiation pressure , gas pressure , and gravitational forces on perturbed fluid elements .",
    "this can only occur for waves which are not purely longitudinal in character , which for acoustic waves requires a background magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that the force responsible for this second driving mechanism can be expressed entirely in terms of the flux perturbation that is perpendicular to the wave vector of the wave , and we show how to do this here .",

    "radiation pressure does not contribute here because of rapid photon diffusion at these short wavelengths .",

    "physically , a compressive plane wave will naturally produce positive ( negative ) flux perturbations through the rarefied ( compressed ) regions due to the increased ( decreased ) transparency of the medium ( figure  [ fig : mechanism ] ) . because surfaces of constant density in the wave follow surfaces of constant phase , these flux perturbations will be perpendicular to the wave vector . in a wave that is not purely longitudinal , these flux perturbations will have nonvanishing projections onto the fluid velocity in the wave , and can therefore cause damping or driving of the wave .",
