    "previously , a quantum walk  @xcite framework was already presented for disordered systems , in which under the influence of quantum interference , an interplay between free hamiltonian evolution and thermal fluctuation in the environment leads to an increase in eet . in the absence of noise , there is hardly any transport since disorder leads to anderson localization of eigenstates .",
    "however , the addition of a local dephasing noise scrambles the wave function so that it is no longer localized in space , leading to increased transport efficiency  @xcite . in ref .",
