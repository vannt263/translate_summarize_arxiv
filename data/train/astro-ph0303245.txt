    "flatness of the universe is one of the most robust predictions of inflationary cosmology .",
    "similarly , nearly all inflationary models predict density perturbations with a flat spectrum .",
    "both predictions are in an excellent agreement with recent observations , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , see e.g. @xcite - @xcite . with the data like that",
    ", it would seem unnecessary to return to investigation of more complicated models of inflation , with @xmath4 and with the spectrum having various ` features . '",
    "however , there is only one way to prove that the flatness of the universe and the flatness of the spectrum are indeed reliable and robust predictions of inflation : we must check whether it is really difficult to violate these rules . here",
    "we will return to the discussion of the possibility to have inflationary models with @xmath4 .    despite many interesting attempts ,",
    "we still do not have any realistic models of an open inflationary universe satisfying the observational constraint @xmath5 . the only available semi - realistic model of open inflation with @xmath5 is rather ugly ; it requires a fine - tuned potential of a very peculiar shape @xcite .",
    "but maybe we can be more lucky with a closed universe , or a compact flat universe with nontrivial topology ?",
    "recently this question resurfaced again in relation to wmap results @xcite , even though these results are quite consistent with the simplest assumption that @xmath6 .",
    "the only potential problem of the standard model of a flat universe with a flat spectrum is related to the suppression of the large - angle perturbations of cmb @xcite and possible correlations between lower multipoles @xcite . however , taking into account cosmic variance , it is not quite clear yet whether these results are statistically significant .",
    "nevertheless , it gives us a good excuse to reexamine possible inflationary models of a closed ( or compact ) universe .",
    "the only way to obtain inflationary universe with @xmath1 is to assume that the universe inflated only by about @xmath7 times .",
    "exact value of the number of e - folds @xmath8 depends on details of reheating and may somewhat differ from 60 .",
    "let us assume for definiteness that for @xmath9 one would have @xmath10 .",
    "then one can show that for @xmath11 and the same value of the hubble constant one would have @xmath12 , whereas for @xmath13 one would have @xmath14 .",
    "thus in order to obtain @xmath15 one would need to have @xmath9 with accuracy of about @xmath16 .",
    "meanwhile , the typical number of e - folds , say , in chaotic inflation scenario in the theory @xmath17 is not 60 but rather @xmath18 @xcite",
    ".    one can construct models where inflation leads to expansion of the universe by the factor @xmath7 .",
    "however , if the universe does not inflate long enough to become flat , then by the same token it does not inflate long enough to become homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "moreover , in most of such models small number of e - foldings simultaneously implies that density perturbations on the horizon are extremely large .",
    "indeed , in most inflationary models the process of inflation begins at the point where density perturbations @xmath19 are very large .",
    "the simplest example is the new inflation scenario @xcite , where inflation begins at the top of the effective potential with @xmath20 .",
    "if there are less than @xmath21 e - foldings from this moment to the end of inflation , then we would see extremely large density perturbations on the scale of the horizon .",
    "similarly , in the simplest models of chaotic inflation @xcite the process of inflation is expected to begin at very large values of the scalar field , where the density perturbations are also very large .",
    "this is related to the observation that inflation usually is eternal @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the regime of eternal inflation corresponds to @xmath22 @xcite . in a small closed universe with @xmath23 noticeably different from @xmath24",
    "we would see these large perturbations on the horizon .",
    "thus , the main reason why it is so difficult to construct inflationary models with @xmath4 is not the issue of fine tuning of the parameters of the models , which is necessary to obtain the universe inflating exactly @xmath7 times , but the problem of obtaining a homogeneous universe after inflation .    for a long time it was not quite clear how one can resolve this problem ; in @xcite it was even argued that this is impossible .",
    "a solution of this problem was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to use the well known fact that the region of space created in the process of quantum tunneling tends to be spherically symmetric if the tunneling probability is very small .",
    "such bubbles tend to expand in a spherically symmetric way .",
    "thus , if one could associate the visible part of the universe with an interior of one such region , one would solve the homogeneity , isotropy and horizon problems , and then all other problems , such as the flatness problem , will be solved by the subsequent relatively short stage of inflation .    in order to make inflation short",
    ", one can consider , for example , a particular version of the chaotic inflation scenario @xcite with the effective potential @xmath25 here @xmath26 gev .",
    "potentials of such type often appear in supergravity . in this theory inflation",
    "occurs only in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "the most natural way to realize inflationary scenario in this theory is to assume that the universe was created `` from nothing '' with the field @xmath28 in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "the universe at the moment of its creation has a size @xmath29 , and then it begins inflating as @xmath30 .",
    "according to @xcite - @xcite , the probability of creation of an inflationary universe is suppressed by @xmath31    strictly speaking , this expression was derived only for the creation of de sitter space with the constant vacuum energy @xmath32 corresponding to an extremum of the effective potential . for the description of the quantum creation of inflationary universe on the slope of the potential one should use the ` gondola ' instantons found in @xcite .",
    "these instantons are singular , but the singularity is nearly harmless since the analytical continuation occurs through the regular part of the instanton .",
    "the singularity gives a contribution to the tunneling action which is small for the tunneling going to the inflationary universe in the slow - roll regime .",
    "however , the boundary terms can be significant and tend to decrease the exponential suppression of the tunneling probability in the calculation of the tunneling to the steep part of the potential .",
    "this is a delicate issue which deserves separate investigation .",
    "however , we hope that this fact does not affect our qualitative conclusions because we are going to find a regime where the ( relative ) suppression of the tunneling will be inefficient , see next section .",
    "the maximum of the probability of creation of an inflationary universe appears near the upper range of values of the field @xmath28 for which inflation is possible , i.e. at @xmath33 .",
    "then the size of the newly born universe expands by the factor @xmath34 during the stage of inflation @xcite .",
    "if @xmath35 , i.e. if @xmath36 gev , the universe expands more than @xmath7 times , and it becomes very flat .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath37 the universe always remains `` underinflated '' and very curved , with @xmath38 .",
    "we emphasize again that in this particular model ",
    "underinflation \" does not lead to any problems with homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "the only problem with this model is that in order to obtain @xmath23 in the interval between @xmath24 and @xmath39 at the present time one should have the constant @xmath40 to be fixed somewhere near @xmath41 with an accuracy of few percent .",
    "this is a fine - tuning , which does not sound very attractive .",
    "however , it is important to realize that we are not talking about an exponentially good precision ; accuracy of few percent is good enough .",
    "a similar result can be obtained even without changing the shape of the effective potential .",
    "it is enough to assume that the field @xmath28 has a nonminimal interaction with gravity of the form @xmath42 . in this case inflation",
    "becomes impossible for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "thus in order to ensure that only closed inflationary universes can be produced during the process of quantum creation of the universe in the theory @xmath44 it is enough to assume that @xmath45 .",
    "this gives a condition @xmath46 .",
    "there is at least one serious problem with this scenario .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) suggests that it is much more natural for the universe to be created with the density very close to the planck density .",
    "however , the effective potential ( [ 1 ] ) at the planck density is extremely steep",
    ". therefore such a universe will not typically enter the inflationary regime , and will collapse within a very short time .",
    "this suggests that most of the universes described by the model ( [ 1 ] ) will not inflate at all , or will inflate by a factor much less than @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , most of the universes will be short living , and if they survive until the present time they will probably have very large @xmath23 .",
    "this is the problem that we are going to study in our paper .",
    "consider for simplicity a toy model with the following step - like effective potential : @xmath47 at @xmath48 ; @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "we will also assume that the effective potential sharply rises to indefinitely large values in a small vicinity of @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] .",
    "this model is very well suited for the description of certain versions of f - term hybrid inflation in supergravity . in such models",
    "the effective potential is nearly constant at small @xmath28 and it exponentially rises at large @xmath28 .",
    "inflation ends suddenly at some small value of @xmath28 , which in our model corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "[ ds ] = 5.3 cm    to study the evolution of a closed universe filled by a homogeneous scalar field in this scenario one should solve the set of two equations , in units @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 suppose that the ( closed ) universe described by this model appeared `` from nothing '' in a state with the field @xmath55 at the point with @xmath56 , @xmath20 and the potential energy density @xmath57",
    ". it will be convenient to represent @xmath58 as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 see fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] .",
    "if the effective potential at @xmath61 grows very sharply , then the field instantly falls down to the plateau with @xmath62 , and its potential energy becomes converted to the kinetic energy , @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 .",
    "since this happens nearly instantly , at that time one still has @xmath56 .",
    "thus , to study inflation in this scenario one should solve equations ( [ 1u ] ) for @xmath49 in the interval @xmath65 with initial conditions @xmath56 , @xmath64 .",
    "these equations have a very interesting solution in the particular case when @xmath66 . in this case",
    "the term @xmath67 vanishes , the acceleration of the scale factor @xmath68 vanishes too , and since initially @xmath56 , the universe remains static . according to our results concerning creation of the universe ,",
    "its initial size is equal to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "thus , instead of inflating , the universe keeps its original size , whereas the scalar field @xmath28 moves with the constant speed @xmath71 .    obviously , this is a threshold regime . for @xmath72 ( the initial energy density above @xmath73 ) one has @xmath74 , which means that @xmath75 .",
    "thus the universe starts moving with negative acceleration from the state @xmath56 . as a result , the term @xmath76 becomes negative .",
    "this corresponds to negative friction , which makes the motion of the field @xmath28 even faster and the term @xmath67 even more negative .",
    "such a universe rapidly collapses .    on the other hand , for @xmath77 ( initial energy below @xmath73 ) one has @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the value of @xmath81 rapidly decreases , and the universe enters inflationary regime",
    ".    we will introduce here a small time - dependent function @xmath82 the beginning of the stage of inflation may be delayed for indefinitely long time if the initial value @xmath83 is sufficiently small .",
    "but once expansion of the universe begins in earnest , it very rapidly approaches the simple exponential regime @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , in the regime with @xmath85 the scalar field satisfies equation @xmath86 which implies that @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the initial velocity of the field @xmath28 immediately after it rolls down to the plateau @xmath89 .",
    "this relation means , in particular , that once the size of the universe grows 2 times , the kinetic energy of the scalar field drops down 64 times , and the universe begins expanding as @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the resulting equation for the scale factor reads : @xmath92 this equation can be solved numerically , but here we would like to make a simple qualitative analysis of its solutions for @xmath93 , where @xmath94    first of all , let us notice that after @xmath95 grows and inflationary regime settles up , the scalar field gradually stops moving . indeed , according to eq .",
    "( [ 4u ] ) , @xmath96 , and therefore the field @xmath28 after the beginning of inflation can move only at a finite distance @xmath97 in planck units @xmath53 .    for small positive @xmath98",
    "the whole process can be approximately divided into two stages . in the beginning of the process ,",
    "when @xmath99 and @xmath100 , equation @xmath101 yields @xmath102 using the relation @xmath103 one finds that the value of @xmath98 becomes two times greater than @xmath104 within the time @xmath105 during this time the field @xmath28 decreases by @xmath106 which is similar to @xmath107 , eq .",
    "( [ 5u ] ) . after that the rate of growth of the scale factor doubles , but @xmath95 remains practically unchanged ( for @xmath108 ) .",
    "this means that the whole process effectively gets a fresh start . after the time @xmath109 , which does not depend on @xmath98 ,",
    "the field @xmath110 decreases by @xmath111 , and the rate of growth of @xmath95 doubles again .",
    "this process continues until @xmath112 approaches @xmath113 . since at each interval",
    "@xmath114 the value of @xmath98 doubles , the number of the intervals after which @xmath112 approaches @xmath113 is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "then the universe enters inflationary regime , the field moves last time , by @xmath107 , and the field @xmath28 finally stops .",
    "these conclusions are in a good qualitative agreement with the results of a numerical investigation ( for @xmath108 ) , which shows that inflation begins when the field @xmath28 approaches @xmath116 , where @xmath117    = 4.5 cm    inflation takes place only in the interval between @xmath118 and @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath119 , inflation does not happen at all , and the universe rapidly collapses .",
    "thus inflation happens if @xmath120    now let us study the implications of these results for the theory of quantum creation of a closed inflationary universe in this scenario .",
    "first of all , we will assume that , in accordance with @xcite - @xcite , the probability of creation of a closed universe containing homogeneous field @xmath28 with the effective potential @xmath32 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath121 as we see , the greater @xmath32 , the more probable it is that the universe is created .",
    "however , all universes that are created with @xmath122 immediately collapse without giving life any chance to appear .",
    "thus the high probability of quantum creation of the universes with large @xmath32 in this context does not mean much : for all practical purposes such universes simply do not exist .",
    "the possibility of creation of the universes with @xmath123 requires a much more thorough investigation .",
    "indeed , it is most probable for the universe to be created with the energy density very close to @xmath124 , i.e. with as small @xmath125 as possible .",
    "however , if @xmath125 is so small that @xmath126 , then , according to our results , the field @xmath28 reaches the point @xmath52 and falls from the cliff before inflation begins . in this case",
    "the universe also remains small and immediately collapses . if @xmath125 is small , but not small enough , so that the stage of inflation is very short , we also have a problem .",
    "indeed , in order to explain observational data we need to have approximately 60 e - folds of inflation ( under the simplest assumptions about reheating ) .    of course",
    ", one could argue , just as we did before , that the universes experiencing less than 60 e - folds of inflation can not support human life and therefore should be ignored . however , in this case the situation is more complicated .",
    "indeed , let us estimate first the conditional probability that the universe is created with the energy density @xmath127 , under the condition that its energy density @xmath128 is smaller than @xmath129 .",
    "( as we explained , all universes with @xmath130 immediately die and therefore must be discarded in the calculation of the probabilities . ) @xmath131 this expression tells that the probability of creation of the universe with @xmath132 will be exponentially suppressed unless the universe is created very close to the threshold @xmath133 , with @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the probability of creation of the universe is not suppressed for @xmath134 , which means that the probability of creation of an _ inflationary _ universe is not suppressed for @xmath135    as a particular example , one may consider the case @xmath136 , as in the simplest models of chaotic inflation at the end of inflation @xcite . in this case",
    "the probability of creation of an _ inflationary _ universe is not suppressed for @xmath137 this means that if the distance between the initial point , where the effective potential blows up , and the final point , where the effective potential drops down to zero , is greater than @xmath138 the probability that the universe enters a stage of inflation is not exponentially suppressed .",
    "we would like no note that our main argument was based on the simple fact that the inflationary regime is an attractor in the phase space of all possible trajectories .",
    "that is why the inflationary regime is reached very fast , unless @xmath125 is exponentially small .",
    "but if @xmath125 is exponentially small , the value of @xmath139 is also exponentially small . as a result ,",
    "the exponential suppression of the probability of the tunneling to the state with the energy density @xmath140 as compared to the tunneling to the state with the energy density @xmath73 disappears , and a long stage of inflation becomes possible .",
    "we expect this result to remain qualitatively correct even if the expression for the probability of tunneling to the non - inflationary part of the potential significantly differs from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "let us consider two different possibilities .",
    "\\1 ) suppose first that @xmath136 and @xmath141 is a bit smaller than @xmath142 , e.g. @xmath143 .",
    "then inflation may occur in this scenario only if @xmath144 .",
    "the probability of creation of an inflationary universe with @xmath144 will be suppressed by @xmath145 .",
    "one could argue that this is not too bad because all non - inflationary universes immediately collapse .",
    "the real problem , however , is that in this case the probability to obtain the universe that inflates @xmath146 times will be much greater than the probability to obtain the universe that expands @xmath7 times .",
    "this means that the universe will have as large value of @xmath23 as possible , compatible with the existence of our life .",
    "this does not allow us to explain why do we live in the universe with @xmath147 .",
    "\\2 ) suppose now that @xmath141 is considerably greater than @xmath142 , e.g. @xmath148",
    ". in this case inflation typically begins at @xmath149 .",
    "after the beginning of inflation , the field @xmath28 stops moving when it passes the distance @xmath150 .",
    "if it stops before it reaches @xmath52 , inflation continues forever , so the universe will be unsuitable for life as we know it .    thus , the conclusions for the simplest model are not very optimistic .",
    "the main reason for it is the constancy of the potential in the interval from @xmath141 to @xmath52 .",
    "this property of the potential implies that the universe typically either collapses very soon , or inflates forever .",
    "as we will see , this particular problem disappears in the realistic inflationary models .",
    "now we are going to study realistic models of chaotic inflation .",
    "consider for example the theory with a potential which is given by @xmath151 for @xmath152 , and becomes extremely steep at @xmath61 , see fig .",
    "if the universe is created at @xmath28 just above @xmath141 , in the point with @xmath153 , the field immediately falls down to @xmath141 and acquires velocity given by @xmath154 .",
    "just as before , if the field starts its motion with sufficiently small velocity , inflation begins immediately .",
    "if it starts with large initial velocity @xmath88 , the universe never inflates .",
    "= 5.5 cm    however , there is a slight difference here . in the toy model discussed above the boundary between inflation and",
    "no inflation was independent of @xmath141 , and it was given by @xmath155 . in the realistic models",
    "this boundary does not differ much from @xmath155 , but the difference does exist and it depends on @xmath141",
    ".    we will denote @xmath156 the critical initial value of @xmath128 , such that inflation still exists for the field @xmath28 falling to the point @xmath141 from the height @xmath157 , and disappears at @xmath158 .",
    "then , just as in the previous section , we introduce the parameter @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 .    as an example , we considered a model where the effective potential blows up at @xmath162 ( i.e. at @xmath163 ) . in this case",
    "we have found that inflation begins when the field @xmath28 rolls down to the point @xmath164 this equation becomes invalid for @xmath165 , in which case inflation never happens .",
    "interestingly , this equation is very similar to the equation ( [ phib ] ) for the toy model considered in the previous section .",
    "this indicates that our results are not very sensitive to the choice of a particular inflationary model .    during inflation in this scenario",
    "the universe expands @xmath166 times , so one needs to have @xmath167 to achieve @xmath21 e - folds of inflation .",
    "now let us remember that for @xmath168 the probability of creation of universes with @xmath169 is not exponentially suppressed .",
    "the probability to start with @xmath170 is suppressed because of the small phase space corresponding to these values of @xmath125 .",
    "therefore one can argue that it is most probable to have @xmath171 .",
    "this means that inflation typically starts at @xmath172    = 4.5 cm",
    "the rest is obvious . for @xmath173 , inflation starts at @xmath174 , the universe inflates @xmath175 times and becomes absolutely flat .",
    "the universe inflates @xmath7 times for @xmath176 , i.e. for @xmath177 .",
    "if this leads to @xmath10 , then an increase of @xmath141 by @xmath16 increases the number of e - folds by @xmath178 , which makes the universe almost exactly flat .",
    "if this is correct , tuning of the value of @xmath23 to be in the range @xmath147 requires fine - tuning of the parameter @xmath141 with accuracy about @xmath16 . whereas this fine - tuning is not very attractive",
    ", it is certainly not as outrageous as the fine - tuning required in all existing models of dark energy .",
    "in this paper we discussed a model of a closed inflationary universe based on a modified version of the simplest chaotic inflation scenario .",
    "if the main idea is correct , one can implement it in a variety of different models .",
    "for example , one can consider a potential with a flat maximum , like in new inflation , and add to it a high ` tower ' on the top .",
    "the universe will be created at the top of the ` tower , ' but it will be unable to stay there . when it falls down , it rolls downhill with a large initial velocity , and only gradually approaches the asymptotic inflationary regime .",
    "as a result , the stage of inflation can be made short , and the large - scale density perturbations will be suppressed .",
    "other models of a similar type can be constructed in the context of hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "similar considerations may apply to other types of compact universes . for example , one of the first papers on quantum creation of the universe  from nothing \" was devoted to the possibility of a quantum creation of a flat universe with nontrivial topology @xcite .",
    "some of our arguments should be modified in this case .",
    "in particular , in certain cases the probability of quantum creation of the universe will not be suppressed at all , whereas in some other cases the exponential suppression will occur due to the casimir effect , and it will not depend on @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this effect is very simple . unlike a closed inflationary universe",
    ", flat universe can emerge from the singularity without any need to tunnel through the barrier .",
    "the only barrier that could appear is due to the finite size of the universe , which alters the spectrum of quantum fluctuations there ( casimir effect ) .",
    "however , this effect appears at the one - loop level only , and it may be strongly suppressed in supersymmetric theories",
    ".    therefore one may even argue that among all possible universes created `` from nothing '' , the flat universes with nontrivial topology are the first to emerge , so it would be more natural for us to live in one of those rather than in the closed universe .",
    "one could turn this argument another way around and argue that if we do not find the specific anisotropy of the cmb associated with the periodicity of the universe , this will make is even less likely that our universe is closed . this strengthens the standard inflationary prediction @xmath179 .",
    "the easiest way to obtain a short stage of inflation in all of these models ( closed universe or flat universe with nontrivial topology ) is to make sure that inflation can not be too long . in the models discussed above , this was realized by making the potential very curved at large @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to a combination of two different effects .",
    "first of all , at the onset of inflation the curvature of the potential was very large , so the long - wavelength perturbations of the scalar field were suppressed .",
    "secondly , the speed of the rolling field was very large . both of these effects tend to suppress the density perturbations produced at the very early stages of inflation .",
    "this effect may account for the suppression of the large - angle cmb anisotropy observed by wmap . to check the validity of our conjecture with respect to the closed universe case",
    "one should find the corresponding ` gondola ' instantons @xcite and then use , e.g. , the methods of @xcite , applying them to our potential rapidly growing at large @xmath28 . for",
    "the flat universe case one should make a similar investigation based on @xcite .",
    "the effect of suppression of the large - angle cmb anisotropy may be more pronounced in the theories of the hybrid inflation type , or in new inflation , where the possible large - scale contribution of gravitational waves will be suppressed .",
    "note , however , that if our only goal is to suppress large - scale perturbations , there are many other ways to do so @xcite .",
    "for example , the large - scale perturbations are strongly suppressed in the flat universe case in the simplest version of the f - term hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "all of the proposed models describing a closed ( compact ) inflationary universe are artificial and fine - tuned .",
    "therefore the flatness of the universe and the flatness of the spectrum of density perturbations remain a generic prediction of a broad class of inflationary models . however , it is good to know that , if needed , we can describe compact universes without giving up all advantages of inflationary cosmology .",
    "the fine - tuning required for the construction of the inflationary models of a closed ( compact ) universe is much smaller and much easier to achieve than the incredible fine - tuning required for the explanation of the enormously large mass and entropy of the universe , of its homogeneity and isotropy , and of the observed anisotropy of cmb without using inflation .",

    "<S> it is very difficult to obtain a realistic model of a closed inflationary universe . </S>",
    "<S> even if one fine - tunes the total number of e - folds to be sufficiently small , the resulting universe typically has @xmath0 on the scale of the horizon . </S>",

    "<S> the models are unattractive and fine - tuned , so the flatness of the universe remains a generic prediction of inflationary cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless one should keep in mind that with the fine - tuning at the level of about one percent one can obtain a semi - realistic model of an inflationary universe with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of density perturbations in this model may have a cut - off on the scale of the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> similar approach may be valid in application to a compact inflationary universe with a nontrivial topology . </S>"
