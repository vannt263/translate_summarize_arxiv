    "thermodynamic observables in qcd such as the energy density @xmath15 and the pressure @xmath16 as functions of temperature @xmath17 and baryon chemical potential @xmath18 provide fundamental information for studying the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions and compact stars .",
    "because of their importance , high precision lattice simulations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite and in full qcd @xcite on the lattice at finite @xmath17 have been carried out extensively for the past few decades . in most of these studies",
    "the integral method @xcite is adopted , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are obtained by integrating so - called the interaction measure @xmath19 calculated on the lattice .",
    "recently , a new method to calculate thermodynamic quantities has been proposed @xcite on the basis of the gradient flow  @xcite . in this method",
    ", one makes use of the renormalized energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) operator @xmath20 constructed from the `` flowed field '' at nonzero flow - time @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "once emt is defined , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be calculated by simply taking thermal averages at any given temperature , @xmath22 this method has been tested for the thermodynamics of su(3 ) gauge theory in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time with @xmath23@xmath24 corresponding to the lattice spacing @xmath25@xmath26 and the spatial ( temporal ) size @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "it was found that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 obtained by the gradient flow with small statistics can be comparable to those obtained by the integral method with high statistics .",
    "an extension of this method to full qcd has been also formulated @xcite and numerical results were reported recently @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report high precision calculation of the thermodynamics of su(3 ) gauge theory with the gradient flow .",
    "numerical analyses are carried out with @xmath0@xmath1 corresponding to the lattice spacing @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "the spatial ( temporal ) sizes are chosen to be @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) with the aspect ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the double extrapolation , @xmath13 ( the continuum limit ) followed by @xmath14 ( the zero flow - time limit ) , is taken using our high precision data .",
    "we note that such a double limit could not be taken in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the coarse lattice .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath31 required for these analyses has been determined on the basis of the gradient flow ( see  ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix a.1 ) .    after taking the double limit",
    ", the final results of @xmath15 and @xmath16 above the critical temperature  @xmath32 reach a few percent precision with both statistical error and systematic errors .",
    "the latter errors are associated with the @xmath33 and @xmath34 extrapolations as well as the scale setting and lambda parameter .",
    "our high precision results based on the gradient flow are found to be in good agreement with the previous high precision results with the integral method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "let us first recapitulate the essential features of the yang ",
    "mills gradient flow @xcite and its application to define the renormalized emt @xcite .",
    "the gradient flow of the yang  mills field is generated by the differential equation with a flow time @xmath21 , which has a dimension of inverse mass squared , @xmath35 here the yang ",
    "mills action @xmath36 and the field strength @xmath37 are composed of the flowed field @xmath38 , which is a function of @xmath21 and the 4-dimensional euclidean coordinate  @xmath39 .",
    "color indices are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the initial condition at @xmath40 is taken to be @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the ordinary gauge field in 4-dimensional euclidean spacetime .    with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) , the gauge field flows along the steepest descent direction of @xmath36 as @xmath21 increases . at the tree level , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) is rewritten as @xmath43 which is the diffusion - type equation .",
    "therefore , the gradient flow for @xmath44 acts as a cooling of the gauge field with the smearing radius @xmath45 in the 4-dimensional euclidean spacetime . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is proved in pure gauge theory that all composite operators composed of  @xmath38 take finite values for @xmath44 .",
    "also , the idea of the gradient flow can be generalized to gauge theory with fermions @xcite .      in the present study ,",
    "we use the emt defined by the short flow - time expansion @xcite .",
    "let us consider a composite local operator @xmath46 defined from the field @xmath38 at positive flow time @xmath44 .",
    "the short flow - time expansion @xcite asserts that in the small @xmath21 limit this operator can be written as a superposition of local operators of the original gauge theory at @xmath40 as @xmath47 { } \\sum_i c_i(t ) o_i^{\\rm r}(x ) ,    \\label{eq : sfte}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 in the right - hand side are renormalized operators of the original gauge theory at @xmath40 with the subscript @xmath49 denoting a set of operators , while @xmath50 are associated c - number coefficients calculable in perturbation theory for small @xmath21 .    in order to define the emt using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfte ] ) , we consider the short flow - time expansion of dimension - four gauge - invariant operators @xcite . in pure gauge theory ,",

( [ eq : tildet^r ] ) on a flowed gauge field with  @xmath44 . with finite @xmath31 , the lattice gauge field has to be smeared by the gradient flow sufficiently to suppress the lattice discretization effect .",

    ", the value of @xmath45 has to be small enough compared with half the temporal extent of the lattice , @xmath77 , so that the smearing by the gradient flow does not feel the periodic boundary condition .",

    ", we have to calculate @xmath80 to carry out vacuum subtraction .",
    "this means that the numerical analysis for vacuum configuration is needed in addition to @xmath81 simulation . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of @xmath82 , which depends only on the traceless part does not require the vacuum subtraction and hence can be performed solely with a nonzero @xmath17 simulation .",
