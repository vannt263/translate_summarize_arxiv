    "a notion of security named physical layer security defined by wyner established an area of research in the world @xcite .",
    "it uses the channel for its purpose by coding and other techniques in communication .",
    "wyner s initial work assumes sender wants to send a confidential message to receiver without adversary being able to decode it .",
    "it was shown that if the channel from sender to receiver is statistically better than the channel from sender to adversary , secure and reliable communication is possible@xcite .",
    "_ m _ is the _ k - bit _ message that is supposed to be sent . encoder maps _",
    "m _ to codeword _ x _ and sends it on the channel .",
    "bob receives sequence _ y _ on the main channel @xmath0 and eve receives sequence _ z _ on the wiretap channel @xmath1 .",
    "finally decoder maps _ y _ to an estimate of message @xmath2 .",
    "the main purpose is to design a system for sending message reliably and secure on the channel when message length tends to infinity .",
    "reliably is measured in terms of probability of error in rebuilding message . for a reliable system",
    "the following condition should be satisfied : @xmath3    security is usually measured in terms of the normalized mutual information between the message _ m _ and eve s observations _",
    "z_. encoding algorithms should satisfy the following to be called as secure : @xmath4    intuitively , ( 2 ) means that observing _",
    "z _ does not provide much information about _",
    "maurer discussed in @xcite , @xcite that the conventional notion of security ( 2 ) is a weak notion .",
    "indeed , it is easy to construct examples where @xmath5 out of the _ k _ message bits are disclosed to eve while still satisfying ( 2 ) .",
    "so maurer defined another condition in @xcite : @xmath6    notice that both security conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are information - theoretic not computational : there is not any limitation for computational power of adversary , and security does not depend on computational complexity of algorithm .",
    "basically the leakage of the information must be prevented and it is unlike the other works like @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in which the marginal information is leveraged as auxiliary information for reasoning .      our coding scheme is based on polar coding presented in@xcite .",
    "polar codes achieve the capacity of binary - input dmcs .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for sufficiently large block length the channel turn into a perfect channel or a complete noisy one .",
    "noiseless channels are called good channels and the other ones are called bad channels .",
    "main idea of our construction is as following : random symbols are transmitted over those channels that are good for both eve and bob .",
    "information symbols are transmitted over those channels that are good for bob but bad for eve , and a fixed vector is transmitted over those channels that are bad for both bob and eve which is defined over all possible choices using polar coding ensemble .",
    "we prove that there exist a sequence of frozen symbols that our coding scheme satisfies the reliability and security condition . in our proposed coding scheme",
    "we consider asymmetric settings and wiretap channel @xmath1 is degraded with respect to @xmath0 and both have nonbinary - input alphabet .",
    "wyner considered a condition in which both main and wiretap channels are discrete memoryless channels and wiretap channel , is degraded with respect to main channel .",
    "he proved that for rates lower than a constant number he called secrecy capacity , reliable and secure transfer of data is possible @xcite .",
    "+ after wyner , some works fulfilled in this area like @xcite and @xcite . in some of them like @xcite , @xcite a constraint is assumed on the computational power of eavesdropper .",
    "a large number of works in information - theoretic security , prove the existence of a code sequences which using them leads to achieving secrecy capacity , but a few number of them design explicit encoding - decoding algorithms . explicit algorithms was presented in @xcite and @xcite and led to achieving secrecy capacity . in @xcite a situation is studied that assume a computational power constraint on adversary .",
    "there are other works similar to ours like @xcite,@xcite and @xcite but main differences should be mentioned . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered binary - input channels for symmetric setting but our contributions is for asymmetric nonbinary - input channels .",
    "moreover the focus of @xcite is on utilizing privacy amplification protocol and information distillation for key agreement but we only consider pure information - theoretic security . in @xcite the distribution of message is assumed to be uniform but we do nt consider any specific distribution on the message which is a fair assumption on message _",
    "m_.      in section ii , relevant concepts related to wiretap channels , in order to show an expression for the secrecy capacity is represented in the setting where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are dmc and @xmath1 is degraded with respect to @xmath0 . also the notion of symmetric channels and secrecy capacity has been defined .",
    "section iii is devoted to polar codes and important theorems that are necessary for our proofs .",

    "this lemma implies that with assumption of degradation of wiretap channel with respect to main channel if a channel is good to eve it is good for bob , conversely if a channel is bad for bob , it is bad for eve too .",
    "in this section we represent a coding scheme and prove its security and reliability .",
    "also we show that it achieves the rate of secrecy capacity .",
    "assume that alice has a confidential message _ m _ which is to be transmitted to bob and should be hidden from the eve .",
    "reliable and secure communication is possible , if the following conditions for any given @xmath81 be satisfied : @xmath82 @xmath83 wiretap channel is degraded with respect to the main channel .",

    "@xmath38 is the vector that multiplied by generator matrix and forms transmitted codeword .",
    "fig.1 demonstrates the relation between defined indexes .        in the following part the coding scheme has been proposed .",
    "according to definition 2 we define our proposed coding scheme by defining frozen symbols over all possible choices .",
    "secret message is mapped on the vector @xmath91 and random vector @xmath92 is generated with uniformly random distribution .",
    "now the vector @xmath38 is formed as below :    1 .",
    "information symbols are sent over the indexes which are good for the main channel and bad for the wiretap channel .",
    "this concept could be shown by @xmath93 message length is k and @xmath94 .",
    "2 .   we send random symbols over indexes that belong to good channel for both main and wiretap channels as @xmath95 .",
    "3 .   over bad channels for both equal @xmath96",
    "we send a frozen vector assumed to be chosen from all possible choices @xmath97 and given to decoder of bob and eve .",
    "polar coding ensemble is used , it meants coding scheme is built over @xmath98 .",
    "encoding is defined as the following function : @xmath99 input contains a secret message @xmath100 and a random vector @xmath101 .",
    "there is no assumption on the message distribution but @xmath102 assumed to be choosen randomly from @xmath103 with uniform distribution .",
    "decoding is divided into two subsection .",
    "reliability satisfaction and coding rate .",
    "both @xmath91 and @xmath92 has been defined over good indexes of main channel , thus according to theorem 3 , both of them could be decoded using sc decoding with probability of error as @xmath104 @xcite(averaging over all possible choices of @xmath96 ) .",
    "so the reliability condition is satisfied .      in this part",
    "we prove the security of the coding scheme . since the scheme is formed over all possible choices of frozen symbols(polar coding ensemble ) , mutual information between message and eve evaluated using one random chosen vector @xmath96 over the whole set @xmath97 . after choosing @xmath96",
    "we fix it and ultimately we should prove that there exists such @xmath96 for our purpose .",
    "the decoding error probability of eve has been evaluated over the ensemble in average sense .",
    "now we have the following equations : @xmath105 equation ( a ) follows from the chain rule of mutual information and a consequence of the following : @xmath106 the last equality in ( 29 ) derived from the fact that @xmath107 equals to zero because @xmath96 has been sent over bad channels for both main and wiretap channels .",
    "( b ) follows form the independence of @xmath108.(c ) is the result of applying the data processing inequality because of the markov chain @xmath109 . below operations lead to ( d ) : @xmath110 according to ( d ) for finding an upper bound for @xmath111 an upper bound for @xmath112 should be found . for the upper bound of @xmath112 we propose the following lemma :    * lemma 3 * : for a asymmetric binary - input channel the ensemble of polar code was defined which means defining polar code over all possible choices of frozen symbols . for proposed coding scheme defined over the ensemble there exists a sequence @xmath113 , which with utilizing it as frozen vector , the following inequality will be satisfied : @xmath114    we define an error event as following : @xmath115 random vector is sent over good channels for both main channel and wiretap channel so we can write @xmath116 and : @xmath117 because coding scheme is defined over all possible choices of @xmath97 and the error probability in average sense is smaller than its upper bound , it means that there exists a specific frozen vector @xmath118 which is in set @xmath119 and with choosing it the error probability does not exceed the upper bound @xmath120 .",
    "now the term @xmath121 is expanded in two ways : @xmath122 obviously the term @xmath123 equals zero because with having @xmath124 there is no equivocation on error , consequently : @xmath125 clearly eliminating the condition of entropy function do not decrease the entropy so : @xmath126    a new task is to find an upper bound for the right hand side of ( 36 ) : @xmath127    according to ( 36 ) and ( 37 ) :    & h(u_r|u_i , u_f , z ) h(e ) + p_e*rlog_2q + & h((q - 1)2^ - n^ ) + ( r_2q ) ( q - 1)2^ - n^ &    according to lemma 3 and ( 28 ) : @xmath128 @xmath129 is symmetric capacity of wiretap channel if in equation ( 2 ) , the base of logarithm be q and @xmath130 is q - based logarithmic entropy function .",
    "if @xmath131 is the rate of coding then : @xmath132    it concludes that for achieving secrecy capacity the distribution of message should be uniform , otherwise there exists a code such that its rate @xmath131 satisfy the following inequality :    @xmath133    and the code rate does nt achieve secrecy capacity .",
    "inequality @xmath134 derives from source coding theorem . so the security of coding scheme is proved because @xmath135 is equivalent to @xmath136 .",
    "equation ( 39 ) holds because according to the definition of polar coding @xmath137 .",
    "we briefly mention our results and certain extensions of them . so far ,",
    "nonbinary - input asymmetric wiretap channels have been considered in this paper .",
    "we proved that there exists some choices of frozen symbols for which coding scheme satisfies reliability and security conditions .",
    "also it has been proved that the necessary condition for achieving secrecy capacity is uniform distribution of the message set .",
    "an open problem is to construct codes for the situation where the wiretap channel is not degraded with respect to the main channel.for example if eve has just a less noisy channel than bob .",
    "our coding scheme is not totally explicit because only existence of a frozen vector that is suitable for our setting has been proven .",
    "another problem is successive cancellation decoding depends on the past estimates of itself that should be correct otherwise that will propagate error . implementing another decoder for overcoming",
    "this setback is of great interest . recently in @xcite a method has been suggested for overcoming the polarization limitation .",
    "the method is based on defining pseudorandom frozen bits and extent to all kind of channels . using results in @xcite to extend our results to arbitrary discrete memolyless channels",
    "is a thrilling task .",
    "it was shown by maurer - wolf @xcite that any coding scheme that satises the `` weak '' security condition can be converted to a coding scheme that satises the stronger condition ( 3 ) .",
    "this has been accomplished using information reconciliation and privacy amplication protocol @xcite .",
    "so the results of this paper could be extented to strong security using results of privacy amplication protocol .",
