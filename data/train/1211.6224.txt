    "the theory of critical phenomena  @xcite at phase transitions generally applies to homogenous systems . however , homogenous conditions are often an ideal limit of experimental conditions .",
    "thus , the study of the effects of inhomogenous features is often essential to achieve a correct interpretation of the experimental data at the transition between different phases , in order to obtain reliable estimates of the critical parameters , such as the critical temperature , universal critical exponents , etc .    in this paper",
    "we focus on quantum systems of interacting particles in the presence of an external space - dependent potential coupled to the particle density , which effectively traps the particles within a limited region of space .",
    "the presence of a harmonic trap is a common feature of the experimental realizations of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in diluted atomic vapors  @xcite and experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices created by laser - induced standing waves  @xcite , which have provided a great opportunity to investigate the interplay between quantum and statistical effects in particle systems .",
    "the critical behavior arising from the formation of bec has been investigated experimentally in a trapped atomic system  @xcite , observing an increasing correlation length compatible with what is expected at a continuous transition . however ,",
    "the inhomogeneity due to the trapping potential drastically changes , even qualitatively , the general features of the behavior at a phase transition . for example , the correlation functions of the critical modes do not develop a diverging length scale in a trap .",
    "nevertheless , even in the presence of the trap , and in particular when the trap gets large , we may still observe a critical regime , although distorted . in experiments of trapped particle systems aimed to investigate their many - body critical behaviors at quantum and finite - temperature phase transitions , an accurate determination of the critical parameters , such as the critical temperature , critical exponents , etc ... , calls for a quantitative analysis of the trap effects .",
    "this issue has been much discussed within theoretical and experimental investigations , see e.g. refs .  .    around the transition point ,",
    "the critical behavior is expected to show a power - law scaling with respect to the trap size , which we call trap - size scaling  @xcite ( tss ) , controlled by the universality class of the phase transition of the homogenous system .",
    "tss has some analogies with the standard finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory for homogenous systems  @xcite , with two main differences : the inhomogeneity due to the space - dependence of the external field , and a nontrivial power - law dependence of the correlation length @xmath0 when increasing the trap size @xmath1 at the critical point , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the universal _ trap _ exponent .    in this paper",
    "we show how tss can be exploited to determine the critical parameters , by analyzing the trap - size dependence of observables related to the critical modes around the center of the trap .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that it is supposed to be exact in the large trap - size limit , thus providing a systematic scheme to control and improve the accuracy of the results , without appealing to further assumptions and approximations , such as mean - field and local - density approximations .",
    "as we shall see , the method resembles standard fss techniques , which are routinely used to obtain accurate estimates of the critical parameters in homogenous systems , by looking at the asymptotic scaling behavior with respect to the size of the system , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "we investigate this issue at the finite - temperature superfluid transition of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) bose - hubbard ( bh ) model  @xcite , which is particularly relevant for cold - atom experiments because it describes bosonic atoms in optical lattices  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we present a numerical analysis based on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the 3d bh model with an external harmonic potential coupled to the particle density",
    ".    this study may be useful for experimental investigations at finite - temperature and quantum transitions , suggesting some effective recipes to determine the critical parameters from the scaling of the observables related to the critical modes with respect to the trap size , i.e. by matching the trap - size dependence of the experimental data with the expected tss ansatz , similarly to experiments probing fss behavior in @xmath4he at the superfluid transition  @xcite .",

    "an analogous tss applies to the connected particle - density correlation ( [ gndef ] ) , for example @xmath231 .",

    "let us finally mention that a substantial different tss is expected in 2d trapped bosonic systems .",

    "experimental evidences of superfluid transitions in trapped quasi-2d atomic gases have been reported in refs .  .",
    "again , the trap gives rise to a substantial distortion of the bkt critical behavior of homogenous systems , see e.g. ref .  .",
    "the analysis of the bkt renormalizaton - group flow  @xcite shows that the asymptotic tss at the bkt transition is characterized by an apparently trivial trap exponent @xmath236 , but the asymptotic behaviors show important multiplicative logarithms .",
    "for example , at @xmath35 the trap correlation length is expected to increase as @xmath237 with @xmath238 in the case of harmonic traps .",
    "the qmc simulations were performed at the infn pisa grid data center , using also the cluster csn4 . in total , simulations took approximately 50 years of cpu time on a single core of a recent standard commercial processor ( most of them devoted to the simulations in the presence of the trap ) .",
    "the _ trap _ exponent @xmath3 generally depends on the universality class of the transition , on the space dependence of the potential , and on the way it couples to the particles . in the case of 3d systems of interacting bosonic particles at the transition driven by the formation of bec",
    ", the value of @xmath3 can be inferred by a renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis of the perturbation @xmath239 representing the external trapping potential coupled to the particle density .",
