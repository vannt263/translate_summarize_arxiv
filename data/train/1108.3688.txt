    "alternatively , one may calculate the expectation values directly in real time . for this purpose",
    ", diagrammatic rules can be formulated that are known as the closed - time - path ( ctp ) formalism @xcite . for out - of - equilibrium systems",
    ", the matsubara formalism does not apply and the ctp formalism is the standard method for a description derived from first principles of quantum field theory  @xcite .    while a canonical formulation is also possible  @xcite ,",
    "the ctp feynman rules can easily be derived from a ctp generating functional  @xcite . moreover , a particularly useful variant of the functional approach is to use the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action in order to derive schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "these are self - consistent equations for the dressed propagators @xmath0 and in principle encompass the full real time evolution of the quantum system up to two - loop order in the effective action  @xcite .",
    "analytical approaches typically base on linear approximations to the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "the linearisation may be realised by neglecting the functional dependence of the self - energy @xmath1 on the propagators @xmath0 , which implies the neglection of backreaction .",
    "moreover , it is often assumed that @xmath1 is invariant under space - time translations , as it is appropriate for a homogeneous , time - independent background .",
    "the linearisation can therefore be justified by the gradient expansion @xcite or by the notion of a bath , that does not mediate a backreaction to the out - of - equilibrium test field  @xcite .",
    "these approximations are often applicable to weakly coupled systems close - to - equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "one could therefore argue that instead of the ctp - formalism , one might as well use a heuristic and more intuitive boltzmann approach in order to formulate kinetic equations that can be solved analytically , or at least semi - analytically .",
    "moreover , such boltzmann equations can straightforwardly be modified in order to account for a finite width of the interacting quasi - particles and in order to account for fermi - dirac or bose - einstein statistics . for finite density qcd , a powerful kinetic theory that includes off - shell effects",
    "is formulated this way in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by a number of recent applications of the ctp formalism to leptogenesis and electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "in single - flavour leptogenesis , the ctp formulation naturally removes the non - unitary overcounting of real intermediate states , that has to be performed explicitly when using the heuristic boltzmann ansatz .",
    "moreover , the ctp - formalism readily provides a framework for the description of flavour coherence .",
    "it can be successfully applied to flavour leptogenesis  @xcite and to models of electroweak baryogenesis from flavour mixing  @xcite .",
    "the approach bears the promise of further progress in the directions of @xmath2-leptogenesis , leptogenesis in the weak washout regime and resonant leptogenesis .",
    "these applications show clear advantages over the conventional boltzmann approach and justify a further development of the kinetic theory based on the ctp formalism .",
    "the improvements from the application of ctp methods to leptogenesis beyond the boltzmann approach additionally encompass thermal corrections in the cut propagators of intermediate on - shell particles  @xcite and the treatment of flavour coherence  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to calculate corrections beyond these leading order approximations .",
    "these can originate from higher order derivatives  @xcite or from considering the effect of the finite width of the singlet neutrino , that decays out of equilibrium  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the schwinger - dyson equations in the approximation of negligible backreaction are solved in order to obtain the propagator of an out - of - equilibrium field that includes finite - width corrections .",
    "we emphasise that the assumption of a stationary bath is equivalent to any approximation scheme where the dependence of the self - energy of the out - of - equilibrium field on the average time and on derivatives with respect to average time are neglected , such as some variants of the gradient expansion . in the case of leptogenesis ,",
    "the out - of - equilibrium field is a heavy singlet neutrino and the background bath consists of the @xmath3 standard model degrees of freedom that are in equilibrium during the time of leptogenesis .    neglecting the backreaction leads to a somewhat curious form of the wightman functions for the out - of equilibrium field [ _ cf .",

    "this distribution has a finite width around the quasi - particle pole , which is given by the relaxation rate of the system toward equilibrium , in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for equilibrium systems . in coordinate space ,",
    "the finite width can be identified with an exponential decay in the relative coordinate of the wightman function @xmath4 .",
    "second , there is an out - of equilibrium contribution that exhibits no decay in the relative coordinate , or equivalently _ zero _ width .",
    "there is an interesting connection of the solutions [ eq .",
    "( [ distr : singular ] ) below ] , that decompose into a finite - width equilibrium and a zero width out - of equilibrium contribution , with the problem of pinch singularities in out - of - equilibrium field theory in the real time formalism . in fourier space",
    ", it turns out that all self - energy insertions resum in such a way that the equilibrium contribution attains a finite width , while the out - of - equilibrium terms cancel  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review this in section  [ section : pinch ] .",
    "it is sometimes argued that the occurrence of pinch singularities signals a breakdown of perturbation theory for out - of - equilibrium systems , even when the coupling constant is arbitrarily small  @xcite .",
    "we emphasise however , that within the schwinger - dyson approach , no such problem occurs .",
    "the zero - width behaviour also appears to be related to a feature of the schwinger - dyson equations on the ctp that is discussed in refs .",
    "when interpreting the kinetic equations  ( [ kinetic : allorders ] ) , that appear as a subset of the schwinger - dyson equations , as langevin equations , they obviously feature a stokes term , that induces the approach of the macroscopic observables to equilibrium , but they lack a langevin term , that induces fluctuations and might lead to a finite width for the non - equilibrium distribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the kinetic equations are reformulated in a way such that they take a form similar to langevin equations . since the resulting equations are however equivalent to the original kinetic equations in the stationary bath approximation , the feature of _ zero _ width distributions still persists within the solutions .",
    "the truncation of @xmath5-point functions is proposed as the reason for the absence of a langevin term in ref .",
    "@xcite . clearly ,",
    "when the effects of backreaction are neglected , the functional dependence of the self - energies on the two - point functions is dropped in order to achieve a linearisation of the schwinger - dyson equations . however , while stochastic sources for the fluctuations of the propagators @xmath6 are addressed , the zero width contributions to @xmath7 are not discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of zero - width terms appears counter - intuitive .",
    "based on the expectation that one should not be able to tell whether a quasi - particle is part of the equilibrium or non - equilibrium distribution by measuring its width , rather than the solution  ( [ distr : singular ] ) , one might use the ansatz  ( [ distr : smooth ] ) , where all quasi - particles have a finite width .",
    "navely , we might expect important consequences for calculations , that rely on the heuristic ansatz  ( [ distr : smooth ] ) , where both the equilibrium and the non - equilibrium contributions to the quasi - particle distributions have a finite width , as _",

    "a purpose of the present work is to resolve this seeming contradiction . in section  [ section :",

    "the propagator with zero - width out - of - equilibrium contributions in the limit of negligible backreaction is derived in section  [ section : kb ] .",
    "an explicit numerical check of these solutions for a scalar theory with quartic interactions and a single excited mode is performed in section  [ section : num ] .",
    "the figures in that section illustrate the behaviour of the non - equilibrium and equilibrium components of the statistical propagator ( the sum of the two wightman functions ) in two - time representation .",
    "these discussions confirm the validity of the solution  ( [ distr : singular ] ) for the wightman function with a zero - width out of equilibrium component in situations with negligible backreaction .",
    "the agreement between numerical and analytical results is of great value , because we can exclude that the zero - width behaviour is due to analytical approximations that are not understood . in section  [ section :",
    "effectivewidth ] , we show that the summation of all gradient terms , that act on the on - shell @xmath8-function leads to an effective finite - width behaviour of the out - of - equilibrium distributions in the collision term . in order to `` observe '' the finite width , in section  [ section : thresholds ] , we propose to use interactions that are kinematically forbidden for zero - width particles .",
    "the main conclusion of sections  [ section : effectivewidth ] and  [ section : thresholds ] is that the use of the solution  ( [ distr : singular ] ) with the zero - width components and the summation of the gradient terms is equivalent to the use of the heuristic ansatz  ( [ distr : smooth ] ) without summation of the gradient terms .",
    "this way , the solution  ( [ distr : singular ] ) is reconciled with heuristic approaches , that assume a finite width for the out - of - equilibrium distributions .",

    "it should be noted that due to the singular behaviour of the on - shell @xmath8-functions , it is not consistent to truncate the gradient expansion of the collision term at any finite order in the diamond operator .",
    "here , we have shown that the gradients can easily be resummed to yield a benign contribution with an intuitively clear meaning : an effective finite - width distribution function .",
    "we therefore expect that the systematics of the gradient expansion still applies to kinetic theory , once singular terms arising from on - shell @xmath8-functions are summed , following the methods introduced in the present section .    in conclusion , the higher order contributions from the gradient expansion that arise within the collision term precisely recover the nave finite - width ansatz  ( [ distr : smooth ] ) ! in this sense , the fluctuation - dissipation relation generalises to an out - of - equilibrium system of the scalar field @xmath9 , for which backreaction can be neglected . in turn ,",
    "when we substitute the finite width ansatz  ( [ distr : smooth ] ) into the collision term , we must not expand to higher orders in gradients , as this is already accounted for by the ansatz itself .",
    "provided the self - energy @xmath32 is not changing rapidly in @xmath53 close to the pole , there is no leading order difference in whether we integrate over the @xmath8-function or the finite width representation of the propagator .",

    "moreover , when we integrate the kinetic equation  ( [ kinetic : allorders ] ) for @xmath53 from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , both sides are trivially zero , because of the symmetry properties of the real field .",
    "hence , in order to `` measure '' the effectively finite width behaviour found in the previous section , we yet need to specify an interaction that can probe the off - shell contributions of @xmath128 for @xmath129 .    we therefore consider a reaction that is mediated by a coupling @xmath130 and that is kinematically forbidden at tree - level .",
    "for such a process , accounting for the effective finite width of the propagators is indeed of leading order importance .",
    "second , in order to extract non - trivial information about the kinetic evolution , instead of plainly integrating over @xmath53 , one needs to include integrals over higher moments ( additional powers of @xmath53 within the integrand ) .",
    "for example , the distribution function can be obtained from the integral @xmath131 for different observables , analogous prefactors for @xmath132 can be found that are typically smooth functions of @xmath53 in the vicinity of the quasi - particle pole , such that derivatives may be consistently neglected at leading order in the gradient expansion .    for the purpose of probing the width of the field @xmath9",

    "note also that we can ignore the derivatives acting on the sign function , since the on - shell propagator @xmath149 vanishes for @xmath112 .",
    "substituting the explicit forms of the propagator and performing the taylor expansion of @xmath150 toward complex @xmath53 , as it is explained in the previous section , we obtain @xmath151 ^ 2+(k^0-p^0)^2\\gamma_\\varphi^2 } \\delta f_\\varphi(\\mathbf k-\\mathbf p){\\rm e}^{-\\gamma_\\varphi(\\mathbf k-\\mathbf p)t } \\left [ \\frac{1}{{\\rm e}^{p^0/t}-1 } -\\frac{1}{{\\rm e}^{k^0/t}-1 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now assume for definiteness , that @xmath152 but @xmath153 .",

    "in that situation , all particles are non - relativistic such that @xmath158 and @xmath159 . moreover , the dominant reaction channel is @xmath160 , where @xmath9 is off - shell .",
    "the meaning of @xmath9 being off shell is that it corresponds to a virtual state , that eventually rescatters with addtional particles , which is encompassed within the self - energy @xmath161 . in this situation",

    "clearly , this can be interpreted as a scattering process , between @xmath9 and additional particles , that are described by @xmath143 , via a virtual off - shell @xmath9 into @xmath138 and @xmath168 .",
    "in contrast , the result would be strictly zero if we would not have taken account of the resummation leading to the effective finite width propagator as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we emphasise that for the present calculation , it is sufficient to take the breit - wigner approximation for @xmath169 , while the dependence of @xmath170 on @xmath53 is of leading importance . for related discussions of off - shell effects , _ cf .",

    "for an out - of equilibrium scalar field , that interacts with a time - independent , spatially homogeneous bath and that only experiences negligible backreaction , we have reviewed and derived various aspects of the solutions to the schwinger - dyson equations on the ctp .",
    "our main focus is the solution for the wightman function  ( [ distr : singular ] ) and its curious feature , that it decomposes into a finite - width equilibrium and a zero - width out - of - equilibrium contribution .",
    "the corresponding wightman function has been derived before in position space in ref .",
    "@xcite , but no _ direct _ interpretation of the different width of the two components is provided there .",
    "the fact that the equilibrium component exhibits a finite width is confirmed by a direct summation of the geometric series of insertions of the self - energies into the propagators .",
    "this calculation has first been performed in ref  @xcite , and in section  [ section : pinch ] we have reviewed it in order to put it within the present context .",
    "the desirable cancellation of pinch singularities is accompanied by a spectacular cancellation of the out - of - equilibrium contributions . in order to verify that the vanishing width of the out - of equilibrium component is not an artefact of the analytical approximations , in section  [ section : num ] ,",
    "we have presented a numerical study that clearly confirms this feature .",
    "we emphasise that when using the schwinger - dyson approach , we do not encounter a problem with pinch singularities . besides",
    ", we do not find a breakdown of perturbation theory applied to out - of - equilibrium systems , that is sometimes associated with pinch singularities  @xcite .",
    "the zero width behaviour of the out - of - equilibrium wightman function , that we have carefully confirmed calls for interpretation . intuitively , we expect that it should not be distinguishable , whether a quasi - particle is part of the equilibrium or out - of - equilibrium distribution . in section  [ section : effectivewidth ] , we present the observation , that an effective finite width for the out - of - equilibrium contribution results from a summation of all gradients within the collision term .",
    "such a summation to all orders in gradients becomes necessary , because derivatives acting on the on - shell @xmath8-function are not suppressed and therefore do not comply with the usual suppression of higher orders derivatives in the gradient expansion .",
    "section  [ section : thresholds ] provides an example , how the effective finite width is observable through interactions , that are kinematically forbidden for zero - width particles .",
    "since the effective finite width takes the same form as the width of the equilibrium propagator , our findings may be interpreted as a generalisation of the fluctuation - dissipation relation to out - of - equilibrium systems with negligible backreaction .",
    "the results of the present work provide a justification for the use of a heuristic finite - width ansatz , that is often intuitively applied within kinetic theory , _",

    "@xcite also feature a zero - width non - equilibrium contribution .",
    "the resummation technique leading to an effective finite width can in principle be generalised to fermionic systems .    in the field of leptogenesis",
    ", we see future applications in studying the role of the finite width of the singlet neutrino , a discussion which has been initiated in refs .",
    "moreover , the correct description of the finite width of out - of - equilibrium neutrinos is potentially crucial for resonant leptogenesis  @xcite in a regime , where the poles of the nearly mass - degenerate neutrinos overlap within their width .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the schwinger - dyson equations on the ctp in the linear approximation , that allows for analytical solutions , are well suited to describe finite - width effects for out - of - equilibrium systems . due to the zero - width behaviour of the wightman functions ,",
    "this is not directly obvious , and to arrive at this result , a non - trivial summation of gradients of all orders acting on on - shell @xmath8-functions is necessary .",
    "once this summation is performed , it appears that the usual gradient expansion can be systematically extended order by order .",

    "<S> this feature is confirmed in a numerical simulation for scalar field theory with quartic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> when substituting these solutions into the collision term , we observe that an expansion including terms of _ all _ orders in gradients leads to an _ effective _ finite - width . besides , we observe no breakdown of perturbation theory , that is sometimes associated with pinch singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the effective width is identical with the width of the equilibrium component . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , reconciliation between the _ zero_-width behaviour and the usual notion in kinetic theory , that the out - of - equilibrium contributions have a finite width as well , is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this result may also be viewed as a generalisation of the fluctuation - dissipation relation to out - of - equilibrium systems with negligible backreaction .     </S>",
