    "massive mimo systems / large mimo systems / large scale antenna systems collectively refer to a communication system where a base station ( bs ) ( having several tens to hundred antennas ) communicates coherently with a few tens of users on the same time - frequency resource @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently massive mimo systems have been shown to achieve very high spectral efficiency[multiblock footnote omitted ] and energy efficiency[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite , @xcite .",
    "currently there is also a lot of emphasis on energy efficient communication systems @xcite .    in the previous work done on studying the energy versus spectral efficiency trade - off ( uplink ) of low complexity receivers in massive mimo systems",
    ", it has been assumed that the only power consumed in the system is due to the power radiated by the user terminals ( uts ) @xcite . in @xcite , it has been shown that with perfect channel state information ( csi ) , for a given spectral efficiency the energy efficiency can be increased in an unbounded manner by increasing the number of bs antennas ( @xmath0 ) and the number of users ( @xmath1 ) . increasing @xmath0 will increase the array gain at the bs , and therefore to achieve a fixed spectral efficiency the required power to be radiated from the uts will reduce .",
    "similarly , increasing @xmath1 will reduce the per - user information rate , which then reduces the required power to be radiated by each ut .",
    "however in practice , the transceiver circuits in the uts and at the bs consume power , which will increase with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , if transceiver power consumption is also taken into account , it is clear that for a given spectral efficiency the energy efficiency will not increase in an unbounded manner with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "motivated by the arguments above , in our recent paper @xcite , we had studied the energy - spectral efficiency trade - off of the zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver while taking transceiver power consumption into consideration .    in this paper , we extend our work in @xcite to the study of the energy - spectral efficiency trade - off for the maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) receiver , which is known to have an even lower complexity than the zf receiver ( since mrc does not require channel inversion ) and also achieves near - optimal performance in massive mimo systems @xcite , @xcite . in section [ sysmodel ] , we explain the system model , define the power consumption parameters taken into consideration , and also state the optimization problem of maximizing the energy efficiency with respect to ( w.r.t . )",

    "<S> we consider the uplink of a multiuser massive mimo system wherein a base station ( bs ) having @xmath0 antennas communicates coherently with @xmath1 single antenna user terminals ( uts ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the energy efficiency of this system while taking the transceiver power consumption at the uts and the bs into consideration . for a given spectral efficiency @xmath2 and fixed transceiver power consumption parameters , we propose and analyze the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency as a function of @xmath3 . for the maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) detector at the bs </S>",
    "<S> we show that with increasing @xmath2 , @xmath3 can be adaptively increased in such a way that the energy efficiency converges to a positive constant as @xmath4 ( @xmath3 is increased in such a way that a constant per - user spectral efficiency @xmath5 is maintained ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the fixed @xmath3 scenario where the energy efficiency is known to converge to zero as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that for large @xmath2 , the optimal @xmath3 maximizing the energy efficiency is such that , the total power consumed by the power amplifiers ( pa ) in all the @xmath1 uts is a small fraction of the total system power consumption . </S>"
