    "the discovery of the dimming of distant type ia supernovae ( sne  ia )  @xcite constituted the first impactful evidence that the expansion of the universe is in a phase of acceleration .",
    "this picture has been corroborated by several independent probes , including measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )  @xcite . under the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , the apparent late - time acceleration is usually attributed to a mysterious energy component with negative pressure  dark energy ",
    "the nature of which is still unknown .    in recent years",
    ", inhomogeneous universe models of varying degrees of complexity have been the focus of much attention as an alternative explanation of the apparent acceleration that does nt require dark energy .",
    "the common base in these models is that the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of the universe is an oversimplification and that it is the presence of inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter that gives rise to the apparent acceleration .",
    "examples of inhomogeneous models include the swiss - cheese models , which consider light propagation through a universe full of empty regions , and backreaction models , where cosmological perturbation terms are included in the overall dynamics of the universe ( see  @xcite for a review of inhomogeneous models ) .    in the simplest class of inhomogeneous models ,",
    "we live within a large , spherically symmetric local void described by the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) metric  @xcite .",
    "the ltb model is an exact solution of einstein s equations containing dust only .",
    "in contrast to homogeneous universe models , the hubble expansion rate and the matter density parameter depend on both time and the radial coordinate in ltb models .",
    "the apparent acceleration is caused by the radial dependence , such that our local underdense region has a larger hubble parameter than the surrounding homogeneous universe .",
    "the ltb models violate the copernican principle by placing the observer in a special place in the universe . due to the observed near - perfect isotropy of the cmb ,",
    "the observer is generally assumed to be located very close to the center of the void .",
    "another challenge for the model is that the void must be of gpc size in order to fit the sn  ia data , but such large voids are extremely improbable in standard models of structure formation  @xcite .",
    "the ltb models thus appear to be unrealistic , but based on observations they have not yet been ruled out .",
    "several studies have shown that with an appropriately chosen void profile , the ltb models can be made to fit data from sne  ia , cmb and bao  @xcite .",
    "further constraints come from considering spectral distortions of the cmb  @xcite and the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect  @xcite .    in the most general scenario ,",
    "the observer can be located anywhere inside the void , in which case observers living off - center will see an anisotropic universe .",
    "there are several ways to test the level of anisotropy in the data to put constraints on the position of an off - center observer .",
    "so far , the strongest constraint comes from the dipole anisotropy of the cmb .",
    "the observed cmb dipole restricts a static observer to be located within a couple of percent of the void size  @xcite .",
    "the caveat is  although it requires a certain amount of fine - tuning  that a peculiar velocity of the observer directed towards the center can cancel the effect of the off - center position so that large displacements are allowed . for sne  ia",
    ", off - center observers will see an anisotropic relation between the luminosity distance and the redshift .",
    "the sn  ia data provide independent constraints on the observer position that complement those imposed by the cmb  @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is to look for cosmic parallax , i.e. , a time variation in the angular separation between distant sources induced by the anisotropic expansion .",
    "planned space - based astrometric missions ( such as gaia ) could measure the positions of a huge number of quasars over time with outstanding accuracy and thereby establish constraints on the observer position that rival those set by the cmb  @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with the contraints on the observer position coming from sne  ia .",
    "the problem has been addressed previously by alnes & amarzguioui  @xcite who found that it is possible to obtain a better fit to the data for an off - center observer .",
    "the constraint on the observer position , however , was found to be fairly weak , partly due to the low number of sne  ia in the data set employed .",
    "our analysis is similar to theirs , but with a few notable differences .",
    "in addition to using new and larger sn  ia data sets as well as a different ltb model , we also investigate whether the model can fit the sne  ia for an off - center observer while simultaneously accommodate the observed cmb dipole .",
    "we find that it is only possible to obtain a good fit to the data as long as the observer is located very close to the void center .",
    "we would like to emphasise that our analysis is solely aimed at probing the impact on the sne  ia observations when moving the observer away from the center of the void .",
    "we employ a simple but plausible ltb model with relatively few parameters to perform this test .",
    "we do not claim , nor believe , that the ltb model investigated here is able to accommodate all the observations coming from other cosmological probes as well .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ model ] , we present the basics of the ltb model and introduce the specific model employed in this study . in section  [ datasets ]",
    ", we introduce the sne  ia data sets that we use for the analysis . section  [ oncenter ] deals with the case of an on - center observer . in section",
    "[ solving ] , we present the differential equations that govern the path and redshift of the photons seen by an off - center observer .",
    "the constraint placed by sne  ia on the observer position is investigated in section  [ position ] . in section  [ cmb ]",
    "we look at this constraint when the cmb dipole is also taken into consideration .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "a spherically symmetric void can be described mathematically using the lematre - tolman - bondi metric , @xmath0 where the scale function @xmath1 depends on both time and the radial coordinate , and @xmath2 is associated with the spatial curvature .",
    "we use primes and dots to denote partial derivatives with respect to space and time , respectively .    in ltb models , the hubble expansion rate @xmath3 for a matter",
    "dominated universe can be written as  @xcite @xmath4\\ , \\ ] ] where the density parameters are related by @xmath5 , and the present - day values @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "compared to the ordinary friedmann equation of the homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker universe , all quantities in equation  ( [ friedmann ] ) depend on the radial coordinate .",
    "the two arbitrary functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 define the ltb models and are as boundary conditions independent , allowing for inhomogeneities both in the expansion rate and in the matter density .",
    "equation  ( [ friedmann ] ) can be solved analytically using an additional parameter @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11}[\\cosh(\\eta)-1]a_0(r)\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath12^{3/2}}[\\sinh(\\eta)-\\eta]\\ .\\ ] ]      we consider an ltb model in which the matter density parameter @xmath9 takes the form of a gaussian density fluctuation , @xmath13 the model has three free parameters , where @xmath14 is the matter density at the center of the void , @xmath15 is the asymptotic value of the matter density and @xmath16 is the scale radius of the density fluctuation .",
    "this density profile is , of course , just a toy model , but it provides the basic requirement of a smooth transition from the local to the distant matter density , without introducing too many new parameters .    our ltb model is more constrained than the general case in the sense that we impose that the big bang occured simultaneously throughout space by implementing a particular choice of @xmath8 , @xmath17\\ , \\ ] ] so that the time since the big bang is @xmath18 for all observers irrespective of their position in space .",
    "the model is thus completely specified by only one free function , the matter density @xmath9 .",
    "note that the functional form of @xmath9 corresponds to a local underdensity also in the physical matter density .",
    "the density contrast , i.e. , the ratio between the local and the asymptotic physical matter density , decreases with time , so that the void grows deeper as time progresses .",
    "we have introduced the pre - factor of 3/2 in equation  ( [ h0r ] ) to normalize the age of the universe to that of the einstein  de sitter universe .",
    "the constant @xmath19 sets the scale of the expansion rate and determines the age of the universe for the model .",
    "note that @xmath19 does not represent the local expansion rate in this model .",
    "we marginalize over @xmath19 in the sn  ia fit , so its value is arbitrary in the procedure ( as long as @xmath16 is in units of gpc  @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , for the purpose of establishing an absolute distance scale for the analysis , we choose @xmath21  km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22 , it is easy to convert the quoted values to any other scale determined by a different @xmath19 value . ] .",
    "this value gives an age of the universe @xmath23  gyr and a local expansion rate @xmath24  km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22 for the model .",
    "based on predictions from inflation , it is common practice to impose the prior of asymptotic flatness , @xmath25 .",
    "we will for the most part of the analysis allow @xmath15 to be any positive value @xmath26 , i.e. , the models need not be asymptotically flat . in principle",
    "we also allow for solutions with a local _ _ over__density . in this way",
    "we can better probe what kind of void the sne  ia data prefer and also leave open the possibility for curvature in the distant universe .",
    "we will discuss and compare how imposing asymptotic flatness affects the results .",

    "whereas the 41 nearby sne  ia are fairly evenly scattered across the sky , the 115 high @xmath31 sne  ia are confined to small patches .",
    "while this sky distribution is not ideal for investigating anisotropies in the hubble diagram , by filling the previously underexplored intermediate redshift range , the sdss - ii data set is very interesting for testing ltb models since void sizes of the order of 1  gpc correspond to redshifts in this range .",
    "the second data set used in our analysis is the constitution set presented in hicken _",
    "the data set consists of 397 sne  ia and extends the previously available union set  @xcite ( which includes many sne  ia from essence , snls and hst ) by adding 90 sne  ia at low reshifts discovered by the cfa3  @xcite .",

    "performing the analysis using these two different data sets is an interesting comparison for a couple of reasons .",
    "the difference in the redshift distributions affects the type of void that the data sets prefer .",
    "meanwhile , the larger number of sne  ia and better sky distribution of the constitution set provide stronger constraints on the observer position .",
    "another important factor is that the data sets also differ in the light - curve fitter used to obtain the distance moduli and uncertainties .",

    "as presented in section  [ oncenter ] , the best fit to the sdss - ii data for an on - center observer in an asymptotically flat model is a huge void with @xmath59  gpc that has @xmath114 compared to the non - flat model .",

    "note , however , that this requires three additional parameters .    in the second case ( denoted as fixed position ) we use the orientation angles that gave the lowest @xmath102 values in the previous case and instead optimize the void model ,",

    "we will continue to investigate the constraints on the observer position coming from the sne  ia observations while simultaneously accommodate the cmb dipole anisotropy measurement .",

    "the inhomogeneous expansion can be interpreted to cause a velocity , @xmath127 , of the off - center observer relative to the void center  @xcite , @xmath128 in this picture , it is thus the observer s position in an inhomogeneous universe , and not primarily a coordinate velocity , that induces the measured cmb dipole .",
    "the cmb photons arriving from the far side of the void will travel longer through a region with larger expansion rate and will thus be redshifted .",
    "this means that the cmb temperature measured in the direction of the void center will be lower compared to that measured in the opposite direction .",
    "the void center is then located at @xmath129 and the orientation angles are @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is possible to introduce a peculiar velocity , @xmath132 , of the observer , directed towards the void center , as a counterbalance in order to allow for larger off - center displacements without violating the cmb dipole measurement .",
    "the requirement is thus that it is the net effect of the off - center position and the peculiar velocity that gives rise to the observed dipole , @xmath133    the introduction of a peculiar velocity , directed along the z - axis , will also affect the sn  ia measurements . for a given sn  ia ,",

    "shows how the @xmath102 values change compared to the on - center value as the observer is displaced from the center in the direction of the cmb dipole . in the first case ( denoted as static )",

    "a peculiar velocity leads to a deterioration of the fit compared to the static case .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath147  mpc , which corresponds to 0.5% of the scale radius .",
    "the observer thus has a small peculiar velocity directed away from the void center for this fit .",

    "the observer has a sizeable peculiar velocity directed away from the void center for this fit .",
    "the @xmath102 value increases quickly as the observer is displaced further from the center .",
    "we conclude that in order to obtain a good fit to the sn  ia data and simultaneously accommodate the cmb dipole requirement , the observer must be located within @xmath1191% of the scale radius .",
    "we have considered off - center observers in a large , spherically symmetric local void described by the ltb metric and investigated the constraints on the observer position placed by sne  ia .",
    "the analysis was performed using two supernova data sets , the first - year sdss - ii data set and the constitution data set , which differ in the redshift distribution and the number of sne  ia , as well as the light - curve fitter used in order to obtain the peak magnitudes .",
    "models with an on - center observer were able to provide good fits which had slightly lower @xmath102 values than those obtained for the flat @xmath46cdm model , but the best fit voids look very different for the two data sets . whereas the sdss - ii data prefer a moderately large void and a low value of the asymptotic matter density , the constitution set is best fit with an asymptotically flat model with a very large void . by displacing the observer from the center we found that the data indeed allow for off - center observers .",
    "for the sdss - ii set the fit was improved out to 36% of the scale radius and for the constitution set out to 9% , the stronger constraint placed by the constitution set as expected from the larger number of sne  ia and the more isotropic sky distribution . however , for both data sets the improvement of the fit was only marginal .",
    "using sn  ia data alone , we conclude that the observer can be displaced at least 15% of the void scale radius from the center and still give an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "these conclusions are in good agreement with those reached in alnes & amarzguioui  @xcite .",
    "we have also performed the analysis using a different parameterisation of the density profile @xcite with very similar results .    in the final part of the analysis we also took into consideration that the off - center position induces anisotropies in the cmb temperature .",
    "while the requirement that the induced cmb dipole must be consistent with the measured value can always be accommodated by introducing a balancing peculiar velocity of the observer , such a motion simultaneously affects the sn  ia observations . using this combination of the cmb dipole measurement and the sne  ia data",
    ", we were able to determine very strict constraints on how far from the center the observer can be located .",
    "the best fits were obtained for an observer located at 0.5% of the scale radius for the sdss - ii data set and 0.2% of the scale radius for the constitution data set . in order to still get a good fit to the sn  ia data , the observer must be within about 1% of the scale radius .",
    "our more general conclusion is that within the void model , observers have to live very close to the center in order for the model to accomodate the data .",
    "besides requiring an uncomfortable amount of fine - tuning , such a scenario also constitutes a severe challenge to the copernican principle that we should not occupy a special place in the universe .    in the future",
