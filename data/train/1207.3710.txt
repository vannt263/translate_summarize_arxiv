    "the mass of the @xmath0 meson has been a controversial issue in recent years . before 2000 ,",
    "three different experiments @xcite yielded comparable masses for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the particle data group ( pdg ) then used these results to calculate a weighted mean mass @xmath4mev @xcite . in 2002 , the na48 collaboration published @xcite a very precise result , @xmath5 mev , which deviated significantly from the world average adopted by the pdg . including the na48 measurement in the average , the pdg in 2004 @xcite obtained the value @xmath6mev , almost 0.5mev higher than the value reported previously .",
    "this created the motivation to repeat the previous mainz @xcite measurement at mami , especially after another precise measurement by the gem collaboration at the cosy facility @xcite gave the result @xmath7mev , in agreement with the old measurements of the @xmath0 mass .    since the previous @xmath0 mass measurement at mainz @xcite , the mami electron accelerator @xcite",
    "was significantly improved to provide a more precisely known electron beam energy and much higher beam stability .",
    "in addition , on - line monitoring of the electron and photon beam positions in the experimental hall was introduced .",
    "furthermore , the old taps setup with its limited angular coverage was replaced with the large acceptance crystal ball @xcite photon spectrometer , which allowed an improvement in the detection efficiency for the two most prominent neutral decays of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath8 ( br=39.31% ) and @xmath9 ( br=32.56% ) .",
    "together with the high energy resolution of the tagged photon beam offered by the recently developed tagger focal - plane microscope detector @xcite , these improvements provided the more accurate determination of the @xmath0 mass presented in this paper .",
    "this work describes the measurement of the @xmath0 photoproduction threshold @xmath10 @xcite from data measured in 2004 - 2005 with the crystal ball / taps detector system and the tagger focal - plane microscope detector . from kinematics of the reaction @xmath1 the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath11",
    "was calculated using @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the proton mass and @xmath14 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "in mainz the real photon beam was produced by bremsstrahlung of the 883mev electrons from mami - b @xcite on a 100@xmath15 m thick diamond radiator .",
    "the absolute electron energy , @xmath16 , of the incident beam was precisely determined @xcite in the third race - track microtron of mami - b with a total uncertainty of about @xmath17kev .",
    "the photon energies were determined using the glasgow photon tagging spectrometer ( tagger ) @xcite , which provided a tagged photon flux of roughly @xmath18s@xmath19mev@xmath20 at a beam current of about 35na .",
    "for the first time the tagger focal - plane microscope detector @xcite was used to improve the tagged photon energy resolution .",
    "the microscope detector was placed in front of the main focal - plane spectrometer ( see fig.[fig : tagger ] ) , so that it covered the region around the @xmath0 production threshold ( @xmath21mev ) from @xmath22mev to @xmath23mev at an electron beam energy @xmath24mev .",
    "made of 96 scintillator strips overlapping to one third , it provided 191 tagging channels with a higher energy resolution of about 0.29mev per channel compared to approximately 1.8mev available from the main focal - plane detector .    into a separate experimental area , where they can induce reactions in the experimental target . making a coincidence between the reaction products in the experiment and the electron in the tagger",
    ", one can determine the energy of the photon @xmath25 as the difference between the main beam energy @xmath26 and the electron energy @xmath27 measured with the tagger @xmath28 .",
    "the 4.76 cm long liquid hydrogen target was located at the center of the crystal ball photon spectrometer .",
    "the crystal ball @xcite , covering polar angles between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , consisted of 672 nai(tl ) crystals ( see fig.[fig : cb ] ) and had two openings for the beam in forward and backward directions .",
    "each nai(tl ) crystal had the form of a truncated 41 cm long pyramid and was equipped with an individual photomultiplier . in order to distinguish between neutral and charged particles detected by the crystal ball , the system was equipped with a particle identification detector ( pid ) @xcite .",
    "pid was a cylindrical detector , consisting of 24 2 mm thick plastic scintillator strips , arranged parallel to the photon beam axis .",
    "the forward wall detector , taps @xcite , had 510 baf@xmath31 hexagonally shaped crystals , each equipped with a 5 mm thick plastic scintillator for identifying charged particles .",
    "a single baf@xmath31 crystal was 25 cm long and had an inner diameter of 5.9 cm .",
    "the taps detector , intended for detecting particles in the forward direction ( @xmath32 ) , was located at a distance of 173 cm from the crystal ball center , making it possible to use the time - of - flight analysis for the particle identification .",
    "the experimental trigger comprised two levels . in the first level , the total energy deposited in the crystal ball was checked .",
    "if the sum of all photomultiplier analog signals exceeded a threshold corresponding to about 390mev , the event was accepted .",
    "the second - level trigger included a condition on the crystal ball sector multiplicity .",
    "the 672 crystals of the spectrometer were grouped into 45 sectors of up to 16 crystals each . if at least one of the 16 signals exceeded a threshold of 20 to 40mev , depending on the relative energy calibration of the photomultiplier signals , the sector contributed to the multiplicity .",
    "all events with multiplicity m@xmath333 and every third event with m@xmath332 were recorded for further analysis .",
    "the latter condition was especially important for detection of the @xmath34 decay .",
    "special care was taken of the energy calibration of the tagger microscope with electrons of different known energies from mami .",
    "the mami accelerator can produce beam energies from 180mev upwards in steps of 15mev , and it is possible to make accurate measurements of the beam energy .",
    "originally designed to produce electrons of maximum energy 855mev , mami can also produce a beam of energy 883mev by slightly increasing the magnetic field of the bending magnets and slightly raising the energy gain per circulation .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the average of the three values listed in the first row of table [ tab : res ] resulted in the @xmath0 mass @xmath35 where the first uncertainty is due only to statistics , and the second originates from the uncertainty in the photon beam energy calibration .",
    "the result of this work supports the three most precise measurements by the na48 @xcite , kloe @xcite and cleo @xcite collaborations and disagrees by about @xmath3 with the smaller value obtained by the gem @xcite collaboration .",
    "the @xmath0 mass determined in this work is plotted in fig.[fig : prev_eta_mass ] with the other measurements in the order of the year of publication .",
    "the disagreement with the previous measurement @xcite at mami is most probably due to the lack of online beam monitors that resulted in underestimation of the systematic uncertainty for the photon tagger energy calibration .",
    "this article describes the determination of the @xmath0 mass by measuring the threshold of the reaction @xmath1 at the mami accelerator .",
    "the high resolution tagger microscope was used for the first time to get the total cross section of the reaction .",

    "the three precise @xmath0 mass measurements by the na48 , kloe and cleo collaborations were confirmed , though the result presented in this article disagrees with the gem collaboration measurement .",
    "the uncertainty for the new @xmath0 mass measurement has been improved in comparison to the previous mainz experiment by a factor of @xmath36@xmath37 .",
