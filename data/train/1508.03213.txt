    "the quantum hall effect@xcite stands alone among transport phenomena because it is characterized by a non - zero transport coefficient whose value is universal , dependent only on fundamental constants of nature and not at all on crystal imperfections and other peculiarities of individual samples .",
    "the accuracy of the quantum hall effect is now established to better than eight figures@xcite and has no established limitation .",
    "this surprising property can be traced to its identification with a topological index@xcite of electronic structure , one that can be non - trivial only in systems with broken time - reversal symmetry . for many years quantum hall states endured as the only known example of topologically non - trivial electronic structure . in recent years , however , the topological classification@xcite of electronic states has broadened considerably .",
    "the @xmath0 classification@xcite of what are seemingly the most innocent of states ",
    "time - reversal invariant insulators  has particularly broad experimental implications . only in the original quantum hall case , however , is the topological index a readily measured macroscopic observable .",
    "non - trivial electronic topology is most commonly revealed by the presence of protected boundary states at surfaces and heterojunctions.@xcite the topological character of a three - dimensional insulator , for example , can be revealed by examining its surface states@xcite to determine whether the number of dirac points ( linear band crossings ) is even or odd .",
    "the observable that is most closely related to the non - trivial @xmath0 topological index of time - reversal invariant insulators is its magneto - electric polarizability,@xcite or equivalently its surface - state hall conductivity . because a finite hall conductivity requires broken time - reversal symmetry , the association of magneto - electric polarizability with a time - reversal invariant state is puzzling .",
    "the accepted resolution@xcite of this conundrum , briefly , is that the bulk magneto - electric polarizability is observable only when time - reversal invariance is weakly broken at the surface and the fermi level lies in the resulting surface - state gap .",
    "when these conditions are satisfied , it is commonly argued that the surface hall conductivity of a non - interacting @xmath0 topological insulator ( ti ) must be quantized at a half - odd - integer multiple of @xmath3 because i ) it must change sign under time reversal , and ii ) it can change only by integer multiples of @xmath3 under time - reversal or under any other change in the hamiltonian .",
    "this magneto - electric response of a ti has been referred to as its chern - simons polarizability . in this article",
    "we show that , in contrast to the case of the quantum hall effect , weak interactions quite generally yield a correction to this observable .",
    "our conclusions are based on an explicit calculation for the case of a ti surface with a single dirac cone , and time - reversal symmetry that is broken by weak bulk ferromagnetism ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketchdopedti ] ) .",
    "the model we consider provides a good description of the thin - film diluted - moment ferromagnets based on ( bi , sb)@xmath4te@xmath5 tis in which the quantized anomalous hall effect ( qahe)@xcite has recently been observed .",
    "chromium or vanadium doping in these materials introduces local moments that order at low temperatures , breaking time - reversal symmetry and opening a gap in the surface - state spectrum .",
    "the discovery@xcite of a qahe in this material was inspired by earlier theoretical work@xcite which predicted that thin films of the tetradymite semiconductors bi@xmath6te@xmath7 , bi@xmath6se@xmath7 , and sb@xmath6te@xmath7 would reveal a quantized hall effect when doped with transition metal elements .",
    "the hall conductivity on both top and bottom surfaces of a diluted - moment ti ferromagnet is expected to be half - quantized,@xcite provided@xcite that time - reversal - symmetry breaking energy scales are small compared to the bulk energy gap .",
    "when electronic properties of the system are evaluated using mean - field theory , this expectation is corroborated in the small surface - state - gap limit by calculations based on a dirac model with an energy gap due to exchange interactions between surface - state quasi - particles and the bulk magnetic condensate.@xcite we show below that the surface hall effect is no longer exactly half - quantized when interactions between surface - state quasi - particles and quantum fluctuations of the bulk magnetization , described as magnons , are included .",
    "the total hall effect obtained by summing over the top and bottom surfaces of a thin film remains quantized however , in agreement with experiment .",
    "we consider two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface - state model hamiltonians with a single dirac cone , exchange interactions , and spin - dependent disorder or interaction terms : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a mean - field - theory quasi - particle hamiltonian for a gapped dirac system , and @xmath10 is a perturbation .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian can quite generally be expressed in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an annihilation operator spinor , and @xmath13 is expanded in a pauli matrix basis : @xmath14 this hamiltonian has a gap separating low - energy valence - band surface states , which are occupied in the case of interest , from high - energy conduction - band surface states : @xmath15 when the surface - state hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant , @xmath16 and hence the gap must vanish at @xmath17 . in order to clearly explain the origin of the surface - state hall conductivity correction , we specialize below to the case of the 2d massive dirac model which is simplified by isotropic energy bands : @xmath18 where we have chosen the zero of energy at the dirac point , @xmath19 is the fermi velocity of the surface - state dirac fermions , @xmath20 is the surface - state gap , and the sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massivedirachamiltonian ] ) depends on the direction of the thin - film magnetization relative to the surface normal .",
    "the @xmath21 term in this hamiltonian is the mean - field exchange interaction between the surface - state spins and perpendicular anisotropy bulk magnetization .",
    "we describe our hall conductivity calculation in detail for the case in which the surface normal and the exchange field on the surface are parallel and in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "this choice corresponds to spin-@xmath23 occupied surface states and , if the interaction between the surface state quasi - particle and the bulk magnetization is ferromagnetic , to a spin-@xmath23 bulk spin orientation .",
    "the gapped surface - state conduction- and valence - band energies are given by : @xmath24    we distinguish two types of perturbative corrections to the massive dirac model : i ) static perturbations in which the hamiltonian is changed but the hilbert space is not , and ii ) dynamic perturbations in which the surface - state quasi - particle are coupled to external bosonic degrees of freedom like phonons or magnons . in the first case , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are charge and spin disorder potentials that depend randomly on position . since in this article our goal is simply to establish that the interaction corrections to the hall conductivity do not vanish , we calculate corrections only to leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "because the leading order response can be written as a sum over contributions from different fourier components @xmath28 of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we can consider one component at a time .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to assume that these functions vary sinusoidally with position with arbitrary wavevector @xmath28 .    in the dynamic perturbation case ,",
    "@xmath29 , we add to the hamiltonian both a bare boson contribution @xmath30 and an interaction @xmath31 between quasi - particles and bosons :    @xmath32    here , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) creates ( annhilates ) bosons with momentum @xmath28 , @xmath35 specifies the boson dispersion , @xmath36 is the surface area , and @xmath37 is a electron - boson interaction coupling matrix which can be spin - dependent . in the zero temperature limit , we can , in calculating the leading - order electron - boson interaction correction , truncate the boson hilbert space both to a single boson momentum @xmath28 and to the @xmath38 and @xmath39 occupation numbers .",
    "these simplifications allow the dressed eigenstates to be obtained by diagonalizing @xmath40 matrices for each @xmath41 .    because the exchange interaction between a magnetic quasi - particle and a ferromagnetic condensate is ( at least approximately ) invariant under simultaneous rotation of the magnetic order parameter and the quasi - particle spin , magnon creation ( which raises spin for the @xmath23 condensate spin direction considered here ) is accompanied by quasi - particle spin - flip from @xmath42 to @xmath23 and magnon annihilation by quasi - particle spin - flip from @xmath23 to @xmath42 .",

    "the hall conductivity correction is due in part to the reduced weight of the @xmath38 valence - band state responsible for the non - interacting hall effect , and in part due to the momentum - orientation coherence between @xmath38 and @xmath39 states which changes the sign of the @xmath65 berry connection contribution . in panel * f * of fig .",
