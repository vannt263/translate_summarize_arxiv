    "globular clusters show lots of fine - structure related to mass - segregation , velocity anisotropies , core collapse , etc . , but as a first approximation their structure ( at least prior to core collapse ) is surprisingly well described by simple king models based on truncated isothermal spheres ( see elson , hut & inagaki 1987 for a review ) .",
    "globular clusters are small enough for two - body encounters among the stars to play a significant role in their evolution , so maxwell - boltzmann statistics ( isothermal spheres ) might be expected to be relevant for them , just like in the case of elastically scattering molecules in a gas .",
    "elliptical galaxies are too large for two - body encounters among the stars to be important , but if they formed through processes resembling violent relaxation , maxwell - boltzmann statistics could play a role there as well ( see binney & tremaine 1987 for an overview and references on these topics ) .",
    "it has long been recognized , that a self - gravitating stellar dynamical system described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the stellar energy , has infinite mass , and therefore can at most provide an approximate description of , e.g. , globular clusters or elliptical galaxies .    in the context of model - building , this has been remedied in several ways in terms of introducing cutoffs in the distribution function .",
    "most notably the king models ( king 1966 ) based on the lowered isothermal sphere with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constant discussed below .",
    "king models fit the observational properties of globular clusters very well , and to less extent elliptical galaxies , but their somewhat _ ad hoc _ nature is slightly disturbing .",
    "recently simons ( 1994 ) derived an exact expression for maxwell - boltzmann statistics by a method which correctly accounts for discreteness effects by allowing macrocells in phase space to be occupied by integer numbers of particles only .",
    "the resulting distribution , which forms the basis for the stellar dynamical applications in the present investigation , is given by @xmath4 , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 $ ] is the value of @xmath6 rounded down to the nearest integer , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number of particles and the number of available states with energy @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants to be determined from the conservation equations @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote total number of particles and total energy , and @xmath16 is the particle mass . in the present investigation all particles are assumed to be of equal mass , and the word `` energy '' is used as a short synonym for energy per unit mass , except @xmath17 , which is a true energy .",
    "it can be shown explicitly ( simons , 1994 ) , that this distribution maximizes entropy under the implicit assumption of fixed energy levels .",
    "for self - gravitating systems no maximum entropy state exists , since the entropy can be increased by concentrating the core and letting some particles go into a diffuse halo .",
    "but in the case of e.g.  globular clusters undergoing slow evolution dominated by two - particle encounters ( i.e.  prior to more violent phenomena like core collapse ) the gravitational potential is almost time - independent , and stars can be expected to adjust into a distribution close to that which maximizes the entropy for a fixed potential .",
    "this is the distribution given in equation ( 1 ) .    in the following sections equation ( 1 )",
    "will be discussed in the context of stellar dynamics , fits of globular cluster data will be obtained , and the fundamental parameters and assumptions in the model will be described .",
    "to find the structure of a spherically symmetrical stellar system described by equation ( 1 ) one has to solve poisson s equation on the form @xmath18 where the density is given by @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes a mass per length cubed per velocity cubed ; for stars of identical mass such a coarse - grained distribution is obtained from equation ( 1 ) by multiplying with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the phase space density of a microcell occupied by one star .",
    "macrocells will be constructed so as to contain the same number of microcells , @xmath8 .",
    "it is customary to introduce a relative gravitational potential , @xmath23 , related to the true potential @xmath24 via @xmath25 , and a relative energy @xmath26 , with the constant @xmath3 chosen so that @xmath27 for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 otherwise .",
    "then @xmath23 satisfies poisson s equation on the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 for @xmath32 , or more explicitly @xmath33 with @xmath34 .\\ ] ] this corresponds to @xmath35 .    introducing a dimensionless radius @xmath36 ,",
    "where @xmath37 , and scaling potentials and energies in units of @xmath11 one finally gets a dimensionless poisson equation @xmath38 ( 2(\\beta\\psi -\\beta\\epsilon ) ) ^{1/2}d(\\beta\\epsilon)\\ ] ] @xmath39 @xmath40 here @xmath41 $ ] .    a solution of the dimensionless poisson equation exists for each choice of scaled central potential , @xmath42 , subject to the boundary condition @xmath43 ( no force at the center ) . the dimensionless potential decreases monotonously and approaches a negative constant , @xmath44 , for @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding density ( in units of @xmath46 ) decreases from a central value , @xmath47 , and reaches 0 when @xmath48 at the dimensionless tidal radius , @xmath49 .",
    "this is the major difference relative to the `` traditional '' isothermal sphere , where the density only asymptotically approaches zero .",
    "thus the total mass , @xmath50 , is finite .    to illustrate the importance of discreteness effects consider first the simplified situation where the physical gravitational potential as a function of radius , @xmath51 , is fixed a priori ( with @xmath52 for @xmath32 ) . in this case",
    "one can specify a partitioning of @xmath53 phase space , including specification of energy levels , @xmath9 , with equal numbers of available states , @xmath8 .",
    "one may choose the numbering of levels such that @xmath54 is the lowest level , i.e.  closest to @xmath55 , etc .",
    "energy level @xmath56 is occupied by @xmath7 particles , where @xmath57 \\equiv [ \\exp ( \\beta \\epsilon_p ) ] \\equiv [ \\exp ( \\beta\\phi_0)\\exp(-\\beta e_p ) ] \\equiv [ \\exp(\\beta\\psi(0))\\exp ( \\beta(\\phi(0)-e_p))]$ ] , using the identities @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the classical isothermal sphere has ( fractional ) occupation of energy levels all the way to @xmath60 for @xmath61 ( with particles reaching @xmath32 ) , so to rescale the gravitational potential one would normally use @xmath62 , @xmath63 . for the true isothermal spheres of the present investigation",
    "there is a finite number of particles , and levels are not fractionally occupied , so only levels with @xmath56 below some finite @xmath64 contribute , corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "choosing @xmath66 the rescaled potential @xmath67 now has the property that it is positive for exactly that range of radii where particles with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) are able to move .    the total mass @xmath70 and physical energy ( not per unit mass ) @xmath15",
    "are given by @xmath71 \\label{masstot}\\ ] ] @xmath72 .\\ ] ]    if @xmath11 were fixed , then a system with fixed total mass @xmath70 could be realized for given particle mass , @xmath16 , with that choice of @xmath73 which obeys equation ( [ masstot ] ) .",
    "clearly , lowering @xmath16 ( and thereby increasing the number of particles , @xmath14 ) corresponds to picking a higher value of @xmath73 to increase the sum .",
    "this is equivalent to choosing the ( negative ) value @xmath3 closer to 0 , allowing particles to occupy states with higher `` quantum number '' @xmath56 .",
    "thus a decrease in particle mass is directly related to an increase in the scaled potential , @xmath74 , for fixed total mass .",
    "as one sees from the figures , solutions with higher dimensionless central potential @xmath75 ( corresponding as just argued to more particles for fixed total mass , physical potential and phase space partitioning ) are as expected closer to the standard isothermal sphere solution .",
    "i.e. , discreteness effects are less conspicuous for large @xmath14 .    in reality , @xmath11 would not be fixed in this procedure since the solution must also obey the equation for @xmath15 , but since ( for dimensional reasons ) @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a slowly varying function of @xmath75 , @xmath11 does not change much if @xmath70 and @xmath15 are fixed .",
    "for the self - consistent case where the potential @xmath78 is given by poisson s equation rather than fixed a priori , the picture is more complicated , but @xmath78 is not strongly varying with @xmath14 for fixed @xmath70 and @xmath15 , so qualitatively the argument above remains valid ",
    "discreteness effects are more pronounced for low @xmath14 , and for fixed @xmath70 and @xmath15 ( and partitioning of phase space ) a change in @xmath16 ( @xmath14 ) corresponds to a change in `` shape parameter '' @xmath75 for the isothermal spheres .",
    "as explained above , the new maxwell - boltzmann statistics in a natural way accounts for finite mass systems . however , many parameters appear ( @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath22 , @xmath11 ) , so it is not obvious that much has been gained in terms of constructing useful stellar dynamical models .",
    "it will now be demonstrated how these parameters are related to observable properties of , e.g. , globular clusters .",
    "figure 1 shows the density profiles for several choices of @xmath42 .",
    "densities are scaled in units of the central density , and radii in units of the king radius , @xmath79 also shown in figure 1 is the standard isothermal sphere , which the present models approach for @xmath80 , and the corresponding king models .",
    "the similarities are striking  not surprisingly , since king models also have an energy cutoff at @xmath81 and an element of rounding down ( @xmath82 rather than @xmath83 $ ] ) .    equally similar are the rms velocities at a given spatial radius in figure 2 .",
    "( for the full simons - maxwell - boltzmann statistics one can show that @xmath84 the velocities shown in figure 2 are @xmath85  ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the so - called concentration parameter defined as @xmath86 .",
    "the value of @xmath87 is typically 0.3 units lower than the corresponding king model with the same @xmath75 .",
    "king models fit globular cluster data quite well for @xmath88 and elliptical galaxies moderately well for @xmath89 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; mihalas & binney 1981 ) .",
    "similar limits are reasonable for the isothermal spheres .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the isothermal spheres .",
    "each choice of dimensionless central potential , @xmath42 , leads to values for the dimensionless central density , @xmath92 , the dimensionless total mass , @xmath93 , the dimensionless tidal radius @xmath94 , and the dimensionless , central line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath95 .    explicitly expressing observable quantities in terms of @xmath22 ( in units of @xmath96pc@xmath97(km / s)@xmath97 ) , @xmath11 ( in units of ( km / s)@xmath98 ) , and @xmath8 ,",
    "one gets @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102    notice that @xmath22 and @xmath8 always occur in the combination @xmath103 ( @xmath8 is further coupled to @xmath10 via @xmath35 , but this can be considered as a consistency equation for @xmath10 ) .",
    "a typical model with @xmath104 , that gives a good fit to the surface brightness structure of globular clusters , has @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 . for @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "this gives @xmath111 , @xmath112pc@xmath97 ( km / s)@xmath97 , corresponding to a tidal radius of 60.3  pc and a central density of @xmath113pc@xmath97 .",
    "choosing @xmath22 to be higher than the maximal ( central ) phase space density of the system ( @xmath114 ) means that @xmath115 .",
    "thus statistical mechanics gives reasonable results for a globular cluster of @xmath116 1@xmath96 stars if one divides phase space in microcells smaller than @xmath117 and macrocells containing of order @xmath118 or less microcells .",
    "it has been demonstrated in this investigation , that a spherical stellar dynamical equilibrium configuration described by maxwell - boltzmann statistics , contrary to the `` standard '' isothermal sphere , has finite mass .",
    "this is because phase space cells can be occupied by an integral number of stars only , rather than the continuos distribution implicit in the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the complete simons - maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( simons 1994 ) explicitly takes this into account , and in stellar dynamical applications this leads to finite mass because one does not integrate fractionally occupied cells over infinite space .",
    "a new class of physically well - motivated models for globular clusters were introduced based on the new distribution function .",
    "they resemble king models because of some common features such as an energy cutoff and a lowering of the classical maxwellian , but in the king models these features are not included in a quite correct manner ( king models still allow fractional occupation of phase space cells , and the lowered isothermal sphere does not maximize entropy , which equation ( 1 ) does for fixed gravitational potential , total energy and mass , resembling the situation for globular clusters prior to core collapse )",
    ".    the new models presented here fit the overall properties of globular clusters prior to core collapse well for approximately the same choice of central potential as for king models .",
    "they have constant `` temperature '' ( @xmath119 ) , but in contrast to the infinite mass isothermal sphere , this does not reflect itself in constant velocity dispersion ( cf .",
    "figure 2 ) . for large central potentials",
    "the models get closer to the standard isothermal sphere , and the velocity dispersion gets closer to @xmath11 . for very low central potential (",
    "@xmath120=1 $ ] ) the models go over into @xmath121 polytropes , but this is far below the range of potentials giving reasonable fits to globular clusters .",
    "any use of distribution functions in stellar dynamics involves an ( often implicit ) assumption about the `` graininess '' of phase space and a choice of unit cell .",
    "contrary to quantum mechanics , where planck s constant defines a fundamental cell size , there is no natural choice in stellar dynamics .",
    "in fact there are even several `` schools '' arguing either for a choice related to the observational resolution ( interpreting entropy as a measure of information content ) , or to the typical phase space size of elements which are not disrupted by interactions over the lifetime of the system studied .",
    "the parameters extracted from fits to observations for the present model include measures of the fundamental phase space density , @xmath22 , and the number of microcells in a macrocell , @xmath8 , but only in the combination @xmath21 ( which can also be interpreted as the mass of a fundamental particle ( star ) divided by the volume of a macrocell ) .",
    "this could indicate , that there is a physically motivated relation between the central potential ( or more generally the structure of the cluster ) and the scale on which mixing in phase space takes place . as discussed above , values giving fits to globular cluster data seem reasonable , and are not very dependent of the choice of model , as long as @xmath42 is not too small .",
