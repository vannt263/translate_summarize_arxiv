    "pure @xmath0-sequences are fascinating objects that arise in several mathematical areas .",
    "they have been the subject of extensive research , yet our knowledge about pure @xmath0-sequences is limited .",
    "the goal of this note is to survey some of the known results and to motivate further investigations by pointing out connections to various interesting problems .",
    "much of the material for this paper has been drawn from the recent monograph @xcite by the authors with mats boij and rosa mir - roig , cited in this article as bmmnz .",
    "we often quote results giving the name of the author(s ) and the year the result was published , so as to also hint at the history of ideas in the development of the theory of pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "the multi - faceted interest in pure @xmath0-sequences is already indicated in their definition . on the one hand",
    ", a pure @xmath0-sequence can be defined as the vector whose entries record the number of monomials of a fixed degree in an order ideal generated by monomials of the same degree . on the other ,",
    "a pure @xmath0-sequence is the hilbert function of a finite - dimensional graded algebra that is level , i.e. , its socle is concentrated in one degree , and has monomial relations . there is an extensive literature on monomial ideals and an extensive literature on level algebras .",
    "pure @xmath0-sequences form a bridge between the two theories , and we will outline the work on pure @xmath0-sequences from this point of view .",
    "but more than that , these sequences have a broad array of applications , and occur in many settings , largely combinatorial ones .    in section [ sec : level ]",
    ", we review some of the basic results in the theory of pure @xmath0-sequences and focus on qualitative aspects of their shape .",
    "for instance , in some cases pure @xmath0-sequences are known to be unimodal ; that is , they are first weakly increasing , and once the peak is reached they are weakly decreasing .",
    "however , pure @xmath0-sequences may fail to be unimodal , even with arbitrarily many  valleys .",
    "\" we include a discussion of recent results on conditions that force unimodality .    connections to various combinatorial problems are the subject of section [ sec : comb ] .",
    "face vectors of pure simplicial complexes are examples of pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "in particular , the existence of certain block designs , such as steiner systems , is related to that of some pure @xmath0-sequences . as a special case ,",
    "the existence of finite projective planes is equivalent to the existence of particular pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "another challenging problem is stanley s conjecture that the @xmath2-vector of any matroid complex is a pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "we discuss some recent progress .",
    "however , the conjecture remains open in general .    in section [ sec : enum ]",
    ", we describe results on the enumeration of pure @xmath0-sequences , with a focus on asymptotic properties .",
    "in particular , it follows that , when the number of variables is large , `` almost all '' pure @xmath0-sequences are unimodal .",
    "we conclude this note with a collection of open problems , most of which are mentioned in the earlier sections .",
    "a finite , nonempty set @xmath3 of ( monic ) monomials in the indeterminates @xmath4 is called a _",
    "monomial order ideal _ if , whenever @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a monomial dividing @xmath7 , then @xmath8 .",
    "the _ h - vector _ of @xmath3 is defined to be the vector @xmath9 counting the number of monomials of @xmath3 in each degree . a monomial order ideal , @xmath3 ,",
    "is called _ pure _ if all maximal monomials of @xmath3 ( in the partial ordering given by divisibility ) have the same degree .",
    "a _ pure @xmath0-sequence _ is the @xmath2-vector of a pure monomial order ideal . for reasons that will be clear shortly , we call @xmath10 the _ socle degree _ of @xmath11 .",
    "the _ type _ of a pure @xmath0-sequence is the number of maximal monomials .",
    "notice that if we think of @xmath12 as the indeterminates of a polynomial ring @xmath13 $ ] over a field , the question of whether a given sequence is or is not a pure @xmath0-sequence does not depend on the choice of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , for many of our results it does not matter what we choose for @xmath14 .",
    "however , in some situations choosing a  nice \" field @xmath14 allows us to use special algebraic tools to say something about pure @xmath0-sequences , so in this case we make whatever additional assumptions we need for @xmath14 .",
    "we now let @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath14 is an infinite field .",
    "we will consider standard graded artinian @xmath14-algebras @xmath16 , where @xmath17 will usually be a monomial ideal . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume that @xmath17 does not contain nonzero linear forms , so we will define @xmath18 to be the _ codimension _ of @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath13 $ ] , and consider the action of @xmath20 on monomials of @xmath21 by contraction . by this",
    "we mean the action generated by @xmath22    for a monomial ideal @xmath23 , we define the _ inverse system _ to be the @xmath20-module @xmath24 .",
    "one can check that @xmath25 consists of the monomials not in @xmath17 ( identifying @xmath26 with @xmath27 ) , and as such it can be viewed as a monomial order ideal .",
    "recalling that for a standard graded algebra @xmath28 the _ hilbert function _ is defined to be @xmath29_t$ ] , we observe that the @xmath2-vector ( as defined above ) of the order ideal @xmath25 coincides with the hilbert function of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath25 is a pure monomial order ideal if and only if @xmath28 is a _ level _ algebra ; that is , the socle of @xmath28 ( i.e. , the annihilator of the homogeneous maximal ideal of @xmath28 ) is concentrated in one degree , called the _ socle degree _ of @xmath28 ; it is necessarily the degree of the maximal monomials of @xmath25 .",
    "the dimension of the socle as a @xmath14-vector space is equal to the type of the pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "see @xcite for more details on inverse systems .",
    "thus the study of pure @xmath0-sequences boils down to a study of the possible hilbert functions of artinian monomial level algebras . in some cases we can rule out candidates for pure @xmath0-sequences by showing that there is not even a level algebra with that hilbert function , but more often we need to use the structure of monomial algebras themselves .",
    "the most basic tool is macaulay s theorem to determine if the sequence is even an @xmath0-sequence ; that is , to determine if it is the hilbert function of _ some _ artinian algebra .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details of macaulay s theorem , but we recall the statement .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be positive integers .",
    "there exist uniquely determined integers @xmath32 such that @xmath33 this is called the _ @xmath31-binomial expansion of @xmath30_. we set @xmath34 and @xmath35 , for each @xmath31 . then macaulay s theorem is the following .",
    "[ macthm ] let @xmath19 be a standard graded algebra with hilbert function @xmath36 .",
    "then for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "an _ @xmath0-sequence _ is a ( possibly infinite ) sequence of integers @xmath39 that satisfies the growth condition of theorem [ macthm ] for every value of @xmath40 .",
    "thus the @xmath0-sequences are the sequences that occur as the hilbert function of some standard graded algebra .",
    "the sequence @xmath41 is not a pure @xmath0-sequence because it is not even an @xmath0-sequence ( the growth from degree 4 to degree 5 is too big ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath42 is an @xmath0-sequence but it is not a pure @xmath0-sequence because it is not the hilbert function of a _ level _ algebra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , @xmath43 is the hilbert function of a level algebra , but it is not a pure @xmath0-sequence @xcite because there is no _ monomial _ level algebra with this hilbert function .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 has been the first nonunimodal level hilbert function discovered in codimension 3 ( see the third author @xcite ) , and boyle @xcite has shown that this is in fact the smallest possible such hilbert function .",
    "so the challenge is to determine what additional conditions on an @xmath0-sequence are imposed by requiring that it be the hilbert function of an _ artinian level monomial _ algebra .",
    "the first result , due originally to stanley @xcite with subsequent proofs given by j. watanabe @xcite , ikeda @xcite , reid , roberts and roitman @xcite , herzog and popescu @xcite , and lindsey @xcite , concerns monomial complete intersections .",
    "( note though that an equivalent property was proven earlier by de bruijn , van ebbenhorst tengbergen and kruyswijk @xcite . )",
    "this result requires us to introduce here the notion of the weak and strong lefschetz properties .",
    "the consequence of this result for pure @xmath0-sequences of type 1 is perhaps not so critical , as alternative proofs could be given .",
    "but its influence in the study of the slp and the wlp in general , and on related topics in commutative algebra , can hardly be overstated . in the result below , and throughout the paper , we will call a sequence _ unimodal _ if it is nondecreasing up to some degree and then nonincreasing past that degree",
    ". we will call it _ strictly unimodal _ if it is strictly increasing up to some degree , then possibly constant for some range , then strictly decreasing until it reaches zero , and then zero past that point .",
    "unimodality is a central concept in combinatorics and combinatorial commutative algebra , but also in other branches of mathematics .",
    "see for instance the classical surveys of stanley ( @xcite , 1989 ) and brenti ( @xcite , 1994 ) .",
    "[ swrrr thm ]    let @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath14 has _ characteristic zero _ , and let @xmath17 be an artinian monomial complete intersection , i.e. , @xmath44 let @xmath45 be a general linear form . then for any positive integers @xmath31 and @xmath46 , the homomorphism induced by multiplication by @xmath47 , @xmath48_i \\rightarrow [ r / i]_{i+d},\\ ] ] has maximal rank .",
    "( in particular , this is true when @xmath49 . ) as a consequence , a pure @xmath0-sequence of type 1 is strictly unimodal .",
    "when @xmath17 is an arbitrary artinian homogeneous ideal , the above maximal rank property for all @xmath31 and @xmath46 is called the _ strong lefschetz property ( slp ) _ , and the case @xmath49",
    "is called the _ weak lefschetz property ( wlp)_. a consequence of the wlp is that in the range where @xmath50 is injective , we have a short exact sequence @xmath51_i \\rightarrow [ r / i]_{i+1 } \\rightarrow [ r/(i , l)]_{i+1 } \\rightarrow 0.\\ ] ] thus , the _ first difference _",
    "@xmath52 is the hilbert function of a standard graded algebra in this range , that is , it is again an @xmath0-sequence .",
    "we then say that @xmath53 is a _",
    "differentiable @xmath0-sequence _ in this range .",
    "it also follows from this sequence that if the wlp holds , then once the peak of the hilbert function is reached , the hilbert function will be nonincreasing , and therefore the whole hilbert function is unimodal .",
    "[ rem : positve - char ] simple examples show that theorem [ swrrr thm ] may fail in positive characteristic .",
    "it turns out that the question in which positive characteristics a monomial complete intersection has the weak or strong lefschetz property leads to unexpected connections to the problem of determining the number of certain plane partitions , lozenge tilings , or families of lattice paths ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the early important results on pure @xmath0-sequences is due to hibi @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be a pure @xmath0-sequence of socle degree @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath54 whenever @xmath55 .",
    "this has the following two important consequences :    * @xmath11 is _ flawless _ , i.e. ,  @xmath56 for all @xmath57 . *",
    "the `` first half '' of @xmath11 is nondecreasing : @xmath58    this latter result was later improved by the following algebraic _",
    "@xmath59-theorem _ of hausel @xcite :    [ hauselthm ] let @xmath19 be a monomial artinian level algebra of socle degree @xmath10 . if the field @xmath14 has characteristic zero , then for a _ general _ linear form @xmath45 , the induced multiplication @xmath60 is an injection , for all @xmath61 . in particular , over any field",
    ", the sequence @xmath62 is an @xmath0-sequence , i.e. ,  the `` first half '' of @xmath11 is a _",
    "differentiable @xmath0-sequence_.    we have the following additional results on differentiability from @xcite :    [ thm : diff - o ]    * every finite differentiable @xmath0-sequence @xmath11 is the  first half \" of some pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "( this is the converse of hausel s theorem . ) * in particular , any finite differentiable @xmath0-sequence is pure ( by truncation ) . *",
    "any nondecreasing pure @xmath0-sequence of socle degree @xmath63 is differentiable .",
    "it turns out that ( c ) is the best possible result in this direction :    there exist nondecreasing pure @xmath0-sequences of any socle degree @xmath64 that are not differentiable .    [ not diff ]",
    "we illustrate the preceding result with an example from @xcite .",
    "observe first that the @xmath2-vector @xmath65 is a pure @xmath0-sequence since it is the @xmath2-vector of the truncation of a polynomial ring in four variables , @xmath66 ; the pure order ideal arises using all 35 monomials of degree 4 in @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath2-vector @xmath67 is also a pure @xmath0-sequence , since it is the order ideal generated by a monomial @xmath68 in four new variables .",
    "now we work in a polynomial ring in the eight variables @xmath69 , and we consider the pure order ideal generated by the above 36 monomials of degree 4 .",
    "the resulting @xmath2-vector @xmath2 is    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the first difference of @xmath70 is @xmath71 , which is not an @xmath0-sequence ( because @xmath72 ) , we have constructed the desired example .",
    "putting aside the class of nondecreasing pure @xmath0-sequences , we now turn to the question of unimodality .",
    "there are three factors that go into whether a nonunimodal example will exist : the codimension ( i.e. , the number of variables ) , the socle degree , and the type . an easy application of macaulay s theorem gives that any standard graded algebra of codimension two has unimodal hilbert function , and in fact it is not hard to show that if @xmath73/i$ ] is level ( monomial or not ) then the hilbert function is strictly unimodal ( see e.g. iarrobino @xcite , 1984 ) .",
    "hence the interesting questions arise for codimension @xmath74 .",
    "we will begin with some results involving the socle degree ( some of which will also bring in the codimension ) .",
    "it follows from hibi s result on flawlessness that any pure @xmath0-sequence of socle degree @xmath63 is unimodal .",
    "the next case , socle degree 4 , already is not necessarily unimodal , again thanks to an example from @xcite :    observe that @xmath75 is a pure @xmath0-sequence , since it is the @xmath2-vector of the truncation of a polynomial ring in five variables , and as before @xmath76 is also pure , since it corresponds to the maximal monomial @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "hence , reasoning as above , we now consider one copy of @xmath78 and eleven copies of @xmath79 as @xmath2-vectors of pure @xmath0-sequences in twelve different rings , and we work in the tensor product of those rings .",
    "it follows that @xmath80 is a nonunimodal pure @xmath0-sequence of socle degree 4 .",
    "a natural question , then , is what is the smallest codimension for which nonunimodal pure @xmath0-sequences exist with socle degree 4 .",
    "this remains open .",
    "we do have the following results from @xcite , however .",
    "* all pure @xmath0-sequences of socle degree @xmath81 in three variables are unimodal . *",
    "all pure @xmath0-sequences of socle degree @xmath82 in four variables are unimodal . * in four or more variables , there exist nonunimodal pure @xmath0-sequences in all socle degrees @xmath83 .    in @xcite , boij and",
    "the third author gave a nonunimodal pure @xmath0-sequence of codimension 3 and socle degree 12 .",
    "this is the smallest known example in codimension 3 .",
    "it follows from this and boyle s result that in codimension 3 , the only open cases are socle degrees 10 and 11 .",
    "notice that , in codimension 4 , the previous theorem leaves only open the socle degrees 5 and 6 .",
    "now we turn to questions involving the type .",
    "of course it follows immediately from theorem [ swrrr thm ] that pure @xmath0-sequences of type 1 are unimodal . what else can be deduced about pure @xmath0-sequences using the wlp ?",
    "a collection of results was obtained in @xcite which showed , in some sense , the limits of the wlp in the study of pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "[ wlp situation ] over a field of characteristic zero the following hold :    * any monomial artinian level algebra of type 2 in three variables has the wlp .",
    "thus a pure @xmath0-sequence of type 2 and codimension 3 is differentiable until it reaches its peak , is possibly constant , and then is nonincreasing until it reaches zero .",
    "* fix two positive integers @xmath18 and @xmath31 .",
    "then all monomial artinian level algebras of codimension @xmath18 and type @xmath31 possess the wlp if and only if at least one the following is true : * * @xmath84 or 2 ; * * @xmath49 ; * * @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the proof of ( a ) was surprisingly long and intricate .",
    "the main point of ( b ) is that in all other cases , we were able to show that artinian monomial level algebras exist that do _ not _ have the wlp .",
    "notice that theorems [ swrrr thm ] , [ hauselthm ] and [ wlp situation](a ) require that @xmath14 have characteristic zero .",
    "the statements about injectivity and surjectivity require this property of the characteristic , and indeed a great deal of research has been carried out to see what happens when @xmath14 has positive characteristic ; we refer to @xcite for an overview of these results .",
    "the consequences on the shape of the pure @xmath0-sequences are indeed characteristic free , as has been noted above , since the hilbert function of a monomial ideal does not depend on the characteristic .    if one is studying all artinian level monomial algebras of fixed type , theorem [ wlp situation ]",
    "is a serious limitation on the usefulness of the wlp .",
    "however , in the study of pure @xmath0-sequences ( e.g. to determine combinations of codimension , type and socle degree that force unimodality ) it is still conceivable that the wlp will play a useful role . as a trivial example , we know that monomial complete intersections in any codimension possess the wlp , thanks to theorem [ swrrr thm ] .",
    "it is not known ( except in codimension @xmath63 , as noted below ) whether _ all _ complete intersections have this property , but the knowledge in the special case of monomial ideals is enough to say that all complete intersection hilbert functions are unimodal .",
    "perhaps a similar phenomenon will allow the wlp to continue to play a role in the study of pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "a first approach using this philosophy was obtained by cook and the second author @xcite , where they _ lifted _ a monomial ideal to an ideal of a reduced set of points in one more variable , showed that the general artinian reduction has the wlp , and concluded that the hilbert function of the original monomial algebra is unimodal , regardless of whether it has the wlp or not .",
    "for this reason we mention a useful tool in studying the wlp , that was introduced by the first and second authors with t. harima and j. watanabe in @xcite and whose study was continued by h. brenner and a. kaid in @xcite .",
    "this is the study of the _ syzygy bundle _ , and the use of the grauert - mlich theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was used in @xcite to show that _ any _ complete intersection @xmath17 in @xmath87 $ ] over a field of characteristic zero has the wlp .",
    "the idea is to restrict to a general line , say one defined by a general linear form @xmath45 .",
    "the key is that the restricted ideal @xmath88 ( which now has codimension 2 , hence has a hilbert - burch matrix ) should have minimal syzygies in two consecutive degrees , at most .",
    "the idea of @xcite was that for height 3 complete intersections , this information can be obtained by considering the module of syzygies of @xmath17 , sheafifying it to obtain the syzygy bundle , and applying the grauert - mlich theorem to the general line defined by @xmath45 .",
    "of course this introduces questions about the semistability of the syzygy bundle , which we mostly omit here . in a more general setting ,",
    "the following result from @xcite summarizes the idea nicely , at least for codimension three .",
    "let @xmath89 = r$ ] be an artinian homogeneous ideal whose syzygy bundle @xmath90 is semistable on @xmath91 .",
    "then    * if the restriction of @xmath90 splits on a general line @xmath45 as @xmath92 then @xmath16 has the wlp . *",
    "if the restriction of @xmath90 splits on a general line @xmath45 as @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then @xmath16 does not have the wlp .",
    "other applications of this approach , for higher codimension , can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "returning to unimodality questions , tools other than the wlp will also be needed .",
    "we have the following theorems of boyle @xcite , which relied on decomposition results and an analysis of complete intersection hilbert functions but did not use the wlp .    * in codimension 3 ,",
    "all pure @xmath0-sequences of type 3 are strictly unimodal . * in codimension 4 ,",
    "all pure @xmath0-sequences of type 2 are strictly unimodal .",
    "a natural question is whether all pure @xmath0-sequences of type 2 and arbitrary codimension are unimodal .",
    "also , for any fixed codimension , it is an interesting problem to determine which types force unimodality .",
    "the  record \" for the smallest known nonunimodal example in codimension 3 is type 14 , given in @xcite .",
    "finally , one can ask `` how nonunimodal '' a pure @xmath0-sequence can be .",
    "the answer is `` as nonunimodal as you want . ''",
    "we have :    [ arb peaks ] for any integers @xmath96 and @xmath74 , there exists a pure @xmath0-sequence in @xmath18 variables which is nonunimodal and has exactly @xmath7 maxima .    of course the  price \" in theorem [ arb peaks ]",
    "is paid in having a large socle degree and type .",
    "in fact , even _ cohen - macaulay @xmath97-vectors _",
    "( i.e. , the face vectors of cohen - macaulay simplicial complexes , which are a much smaller subset of pure @xmath0-sequences ) can be nonunimodal with arbitrarily many peaks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this result considerably extends theorem [ arb peaks ] , even though , unlike for arbitrary pure @xmath0-sequences , here the number of variables becomes necessarily very large as the number of peaks increases .",
    "a good topic to build a bridge between the algebraic and the combinatorial sides of the theory of pure @xmath0-sequences is the _ interval conjecture_.    the _ interval property _ ( ip ) was introduced in 2009 by the third author @xcite , where he conjectured its existence for the set of hilbert functions of level  and , in a suitably symmetric way , gorenstein  algebras .",
    "namely , the ip says that if two ( not necessarily finite ) sequences , @xmath2 and @xmath98 , of a class @xmath99 of integer sequences coincide in all entries but one , say @xmath100 for some index @xmath46 and some positive integer @xmath101 , then the sequences @xmath102 are also in @xmath99 , for all @xmath103    given that level and gorenstein hilbert functions are nearly impossible to characterize , the ip appears to be both a very natural property and one of the strongest structural results that we might hope to achieve for the set of such sequences .",
    "for example , it is proved in @xcite that the ip holds for all gorenstein hilbert functions of socle degree 4 .",
    "since gorenstein hilbert functions are symmetric , this means that , for any fixed @xmath18 , @xmath104 is gorenstein if and only if @xmath105 ranges between some minimum possible value , say @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "this latter is the maximum allowed by a polynomial ring in @xmath18 variables , and is achieved by the so - called _ compressed _ gorenstein algebras ( see , e.g. , the 1984 papers of frberg - laksov and iarrobino @xcite or the third author s works @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the existence of the ip for these hilbert functions is especially helpful in view of the fact that , for most codimensions @xmath18 , the value of @xmath106 is not known . in fact , such gorenstein hilbert functions are `` highly '' nonunimodal .",
    "asymptotically , we have @xmath108 as proved by these three authors in @xcite ( 2008 ) , solving a longstanding conjecture of stanley @xcite ( see also @xcite , 2009 , for some broad generalizations ) .",
    "the interval property is still wide open today for both level and gorenstein algebras .    in a more combinatorial direction , in bmmnz 2012",
    "the ip has then also been conjectured for : 1 ) pure @xmath0-sequences ( under the name `` icp '' ) ; and 2 ) the @xmath97-vectors of pure simplicial complexes , a topic of discussion of the next section .    as for pure @xmath0-sequences ,",
    "the icp has been proved in a number of special cases .",
    "most importantly , it is known when the socle degree is at most 3 , in any number of variables .",
    "the icp holds for the set of all pure @xmath0-sequences of socle degree @xmath109 .",
    "thanks to this result , h.t .",
    "h , e. stokes and the third author @xcite have recently developed a new approach leading to a proof of stanley s matroid @xmath2-vector conjecture in krull - dimension 3 , as we will see in the next section .    while the icp remains open in most instances",
    " e.g. , in three variables  it must be pointed out that , just recently , it has been _ disproved _ in the four variable case by constantinescu and varbaro ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1.10 ) ) , who found the following counterexample .",
    "[ cv ex ] consider the pure order ideals generated by @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "their @xmath2-vectors are the pure @xmath0-sequences @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "however , an exhaustive computer search over all sets of three monomials of degree 6 in four variables reveals that the sequence @xmath114 is not pure , contrary to the icp .",
    "it is worth remarking that @xmath115 is , however , a level @xmath2-vector , and so this does not provide a counterexample to the ip for arbitrary level algebras .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 is the @xmath2-vector of a level algebra in four variables whose inverse system is generated by two sums of sixth powers of six general linear forms each , and the sixth power of one general linear form .",
    "as for pure @xmath97-vectors , the ip is still wide open , and little progress has been made so far .    in general , at this time it is still unclear what the exact scope of the interval property is , and if it can also be of use in other areas of combinatorial algebra or even enumerative combinatorics .",
    "it is well known to hold , e.g. , for the set of hilbert functions of graded algebras of any krull - dimension ( see macaulay s theorem ) , the @xmath97-vectors of arbitrary simplicial complexes ( the kruskal - katona theorem ) , and the @xmath97-vectors of cohen - macaulay complexes ( bmmnz 2012 ) .",
    "instead , the ip fails quite dramatically , for example , for matroid @xmath2-vectors , which are conjecturally another subset of pure @xmath0-sequences , as we will see in the next section ( we refer to bmmnz 2012 and @xcite for details ) .",
    "stanley and the third author @xcite recently looked at the ip in the context of _",
    "@xmath18-differential posets _ , a class of ranked posets generalizing the young lattice of integer partitions and the young - fibonacci lattice . here ,",
    "even though the ip fails in general , it might be a reasonable property to conjecture , for instance , for @xmath84 , which is the most natural class of differential posets .",
    "much of the motivation for the study of pure @xmath0-sequences comes from combinatorics , and in this section we give an overview of this side of the theory . in order to put in context the definition of a pure @xmath0-sequence given in the introduction",

    "an _ order ideal _ in a poset @xmath99 is a subset @xmath17 of @xmath99 that is closed with respect to `` @xmath123 '' that is , if @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then @xmath126 .",
    "thus , our monomial order ideals are the ( finite ) order ideals of the poset @xmath127 of all monomials in the polynomial ring @xmath128 $ ] , where the binary relation of @xmath127 is divisibility .",
    "notice that @xmath127 is a _ ranked _ poset , where the rank of a monomial is its degree in @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , macaulay s @xmath0-sequences are exactly the possible rank functions of the order ideals of @xmath127 , since every hilbert function satisfying macaulay s theorem can be achieved by a monomial algebra .",
    "similarly , as we have seen , a pure @xmath0-sequence is the rank function of some monomial order ideal whose _ generators _",
    "( i.e. , the antichain of maximal monomials ) are all of the same degree .    another fundamental class of order ideals",
    "are those contained in the _ boolean algebra _ @xmath129 , the poset of all subsets of @xmath130 , ordered by inclusion . by identifying the integer @xmath46 with a vertex @xmath131",
    ", the order ideals of @xmath129 are usually called _ simplicial complexes _ ( on @xmath18 vertices ) .    the elements of a simplicial complex @xmath132 are dubbed _ faces _ , and the maximal faces are the _ facets _ of @xmath132 .",
    "the _ dimension of a face _ is its cardinality minus 1 , and the _ dimension of @xmath132 _ is the largest of the dimensions of its faces .",
    "notice that if we identify @xmath131 with a variable @xmath133 $ ] , then simplicial complexes also coincide with the order ideals of @xmath127 generated by _ squarefree _ monomials .",
    "in particular , if we define as _ pure _ those simplicial complexes whose facets have all the same dimension , then clearly their rank vectors , called _",
    "pure @xmath97-vectors _ , are the special subset of pure @xmath0-sequences that can be generated by squarefree monomials .",
    "the simplicial complex @xmath134 is the order ideal of @xmath135 generated by @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "equivalently , @xmath139 is the pure @xmath0-sequence generated by the two squarefree monomials @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    similarly to macaulay",
    "s theorem for arbitrary @xmath0-sequences , we know a characterization of the class of pure @xmath97-vectors thanks to the classical _ kruskal - katona theorem _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , analogously , things become dramatically more complicated ( hopeless , we should say ) when it comes to attempting a characterization of _ pure _ @xmath97-vectors .    in the last section of bmmnz 2012 ,",
    "we have begun a study of pure @xmath97-vectors , but still very little is known today beyond what is known for arbitrary pure @xmath0-sequences .    besides their obvious intrinsic importance",
    " simplicial complexes are a central object in algebraic combinatorics , combinatorial algebra and topology , just to name a few subjects  pure @xmath97-vectors also carry fascinating applications .",
    "it is on their connections to finite geometries and design theory that we want to focus in the next portion of this section .",
    "it will follow from our discussion , as probably first observed by bjrner ( @xcite , 1994 ) , that a characterization of pure simplicial complexes and their @xmath97-vectors would imply , for instance , that of all steiner systems , and as a further special case , a classification of all finite projective planes , one of the major open problems in geometry .    a _ steiner system _",
    "@xmath142 is an @xmath18-element set @xmath143 , together with a collection of @xmath144-subsets of @xmath143 , called _ blocks _ , such that every @xmath145-subset of @xmath143 is contained in exactly one block .",
    "steiner systems are a special family of the so - called _",
    "block designs_. we refer our reader to the two texts @xcite , where she can find a truly vast amount of information on combinatorial designs .",
    "for instance , a steiner _",
    "triple _ system ( sts ) is a steiner system @xmath146 , while @xmath147 is dubbed a steiner _",
    "system , where @xmath18 is the _ order _ of the system .",
    "since we are dealing with maximal sets of the same cardinality ( @xmath144 , in this case ) , it is clear that if we identify each element of @xmath143 with a variable @xmath27 , then the existence of steiner systems ( and similarly for other block designs ) will be equivalent to the existence of certain pure @xmath97-vectors .",
    "let us consider sts s of order 7 , i.e. , @xmath148 .",
    "constructing such a design is tantamount to determining a family of squarefree degree 3 monomials of @xmath149 $ ] , say @xmath150 , such that each squarefree degree 2 monomial of @xmath20 divides exactly one of the @xmath151 .    clearly , since there are @xmath152 squarefree degree 2 monomials in @xmath20 , if the @xmath151 exist , then @xmath153 .",
    "in other words , @xmath148 exists if and only if @xmath154 is a pure @xmath97-vector .",
    "notice also that @xmath97 exists as a pure @xmath97-vector if and only if it exists as a pure @xmath0-sequence , since for seven degree 3 monomials to have a total of 21 degree 2 divisors , each needs to have exactly three linear divisors , i.e. , it must be squarefree .",
    "it is easy to see that an sts of order 7 , and so the pure @xmath97-vector @xmath155 , do indeed exist , using the monomial order ideal generated by : @xmath156    some simple numerical observations show that a necessary condition for an sts of order @xmath18 to exist is that @xmath18 be congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 6 , and it is a classical result of kirkman ( @xcite , 1847 ) that this is also sufficient . in other words , @xmath157 is a pure @xmath97-vector , if and only if it is a pure @xmath0-sequence , if and only if @xmath18 is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 6 .    a different , and more challenging , problem is the classification of all steiner systems , up to isomorphism .",
    "even the existence of particular systems sometimes brings into the story a nontrivial amount of interesting algebra . as an illustration ,",
    "we mention here the case of the steiner systems @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , which are intimately connected to the first sporadic finite simple groups ever discovered , called the _ mathieu groups _ ( see e.l .",
    "mathieu @xcite , 1861 and 1873 ) . these five groups",
    " denoted respectively by @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167  in fact arise as the _ automorphism groups _ of the above steiner systems ( i.e. , the transformations of the systems that preserve the blocks ) .",
    "there exists only one sts of order 7 , which is called the _ fano plane _",
    "( see the figure below ) for reasons that will be clear in a minute .",
    "in other words , the seven monomials of the previous example are , up to isomorphism , the only possible set of generators for a pure order ideal in @xmath168 $ ] with @xmath169 as its pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "( 150,0 ) ( 223,148)@xmath170 ( 164,95)@xmath171 ( 256,95)@xmath172 ( 226,72)@xmath173 ( 134,37)@xmath174 ( 209,25)@xmath175 ( 286,37)@xmath176    also for @xmath177 , there exists a unique sts .",
    "however , it is reasonable to believe that the number of nonisomorphic sts increases extremely quickly for @xmath18 large .",
    "for instance , there are 80 nonisomorphic sts of order 15 , and there are @xmath178 of order 19 .    similarly , the possible orders of steiner quadruple systems are known and nicely characterized , since the obvious necessary conditions again turn out to be also sufficient : @xmath147 exists if and only if its order @xmath18 is congruent to 2 or 4 modulo 6 , as proved by hanani ( @xcite , 1960 ) .",
    "in other words , reasoning as above , since there are four possible 3-subsets of any given 4-set , we have that @xmath179 is a pure @xmath97-vector if and only if it is a pure @xmath0-sequence , if and only if @xmath18 is congruent to 2 or 4 modulo 6 .",
    "however , as we increase the cardinality @xmath144 of the blocks , things become more and more obscure .",
    "this is due to the high complexity of computing combinatorial designs over a large vertex set , as well as to the lack of a general theory .",
    "already for steiner quintuple systems , the trivial necessary conditions ( @xmath18 congruent to 3 or 5 , but not to 4 , modulo 6 ) are no longer sufficient .",
    "for example , no steiner quintuple system @xmath180 exists ( see @xcite , 2008 ) .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath18 for which the existence of @xmath181 is currently open is @xmath182 . in other words",
    ", it is unknown whether @xmath183 is a pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "perhaps the best - known family of examples of steiner systems is that of finite projective planes , so they deserve a special mention here .",
    "recall that a _ projective plane _ is a collection of points and lines such that any two lines `` intersect at '' exactly one point , and any two points `` lie on '' exactly one line ( one also assumes that there exist four points no three of which are collinear , in order to avoid uninteresting pathological situations ) .",
    "if the projective plane is finite , it can easily be seen that the number of points is equal to the number of lines , and that this number must be of the form @xmath184 , where the integer @xmath185 is the _ order _ of the plane .",
    "further , in a projective plane of order @xmath185 , any line contains exactly @xmath186 points , and by duality , any point is at the intersection of exactly @xmath186 lines . in other words ,",
    "finite projective planes are the steiner systems @xmath187 .",
    "the reader may want to consult , e.g. , @xcite for an introduction to this area .",
    "thus , the above example of a steiner system @xmath148 , the fano plane , is the unique smallest possible projective plane .",
    "similarly to how we argued earlier in terms of pure @xmath97-vectors , one can show that a projective plane of order @xmath185 exists if and only if @xmath188 is a pure @xmath97-vector , if and only if it is a pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "a major open problem in geometry asks for a classification of all finite projective planes , or even just of the possible values that @xmath185 may assume .",
    "conjecturally , @xmath185 is always the power of a prime , and it is a standard algebraic exercise , using finite field theory , to construct a projective plane of any order @xmath189 .",
    "the best general necessary condition known today on @xmath185 is still the following theorem from @xcite :    if @xmath185 is the order of a projective plane and @xmath185 is congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 4 , then @xmath185 is the sum of two squares .",
    "thus , for instance , as a consequence of the bruck - ryser - chowla theorem , no projective plane of order 6 exists . in other words , @xmath190 is not a pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "however , already ruling out the existence of projective planes of order 10 has required a major computational effort ( see lam @xcite , 1991 ) .",
    "the case @xmath191 is still open .",
    "notice that , at least for certain values of @xmath185 , the number of nonisomorphic projective planes of order @xmath185 can be very large , and a general classification seems entirely out of reach .",
    "the smallest @xmath185 for which there exists more than one nonisomorphic projective plane is @xmath192 , where the four possible cases were already known to o. veblen ( @xcite , 1907 ) .",
    "the second important application of pure @xmath0-sequences that we want to discuss brings our attention to a very special class of simplicial complexes , called _ matroid _ complexes .",
    "matroids are ubiquitous in mathematics , where they often show up in surprising ways ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the algebraic theory of matroids began in the same 1977 seminal paper of stanley @xcite that introduced pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "a finite matroid can be naturally identified with a pure simplicial complex over @xmath193 , such that its restriction to any subset of @xmath143 is also a pure complex .",
    "one associates , to any given simplicial complex @xmath132 over @xmath194 , the following squarefree monomial ideal in @xmath195 $ ] , where @xmath14 is a field : @xmath196 @xmath197 is called the _ stanley - reisner ideal _ of the complex @xmath132 , and the quotient algebra @xmath198 is its _ stanley - reisner ring_.    it is a standard fact of combinatorial commutative algebra ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the stanley - reisner ring @xmath198 of a matroid complex is cohen - macaulay and level , although of course of positive krull - dimension ( except in degenerate cases ) . thus , the @xmath2-vector of @xmath198 is level , since it is the @xmath2-vector of an artinian reduction of @xmath198 . however , even though @xmath198 is presented by monomials , notice that its artinian reductions will in general be far from monomial , for they require taking quotients by `` general enough '' linear forms .",
    "the following spectacularly simple conjecture of stanley ( @xcite , 1977 ) predicts that , for any matroid complex @xmath132 , we can nonetheless find _ some _ artinian monomial level algebra having the @xmath2-vector of @xmath198 as its @xmath2-vector :    [ stst ] any matroid @xmath2-vector is a pure @xmath0-sequence .",
    "the problem of characterizing matroid @xmath2-vectors appears to be once again hopeless , and conjecture [ stst ] has motivated much of the algebraic work done on matroids over the past 35 years ( see , as a highly nonexhaustive list , @xcite ) .",
    "the main approach to conjecture [ stst ] has been , given the @xmath2-vectors of a certain class of matroids , to explicitly produce some pure monomial order ideals having those matroid @xmath2-vectors as their pure @xmath0-sequences .",

    "the approach of @xcite has already led to a proof of conjecture [ stst ] for all matroid complexes of krull - dimension at most 2 ( the dimension 1 case , that had been the focus of a large portion of the thesis @xcite , simply followed in a few lines ) .",
    "all matroid @xmath2-vectors @xmath199 are pure @xmath0-sequences .",
    "more generally , the following is a first concrete , if still tentative , general approach to conjecture [ stst ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "assuming conjecture [ stst ] holds for all matroid complexes whose deletions with respect to any vertex are cones ( which may not be too difficult to show with the techniques of paper @xcite ) , conjecture [ stst ] is true in general under the following two natural ( but still too bold ? ) assumptions :    1 .   _",

    "as we have seen above , pure @xmath0-sequences arise in several areas , yet their properties are not well understood , and there are other important questions that should be addressed even if a classification is not available .",

    "what happens asymptotically ?",
    "moreover , we have seen that pure @xmath0-sequences can be as far from being unimodal as we want .",
    "nevertheless , one may ask : what are the odds for a pure @xmath0-sequence to be unimodal ?    in order to discuss such questions , let us denote by @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 the sets of @xmath0-sequences , pure @xmath0-sequences , and differentiable @xmath0-sequences , respectively , that have codimension @xmath18 and socle degree @xmath10 . recall that given two functions @xmath205",

    "for example , gorenstein algebras have type 1 and admit any positive socle degree and codimension .",
