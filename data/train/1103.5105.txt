    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) is now a standard tool for calculating excited - state energies .",
    "simultaneously parallel efforts have always been made to develop time - independent excited state density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "these include work of ziegler et al .",
    "@xcite , gunnarsson and lundqvist @xcite , von barth @xcite , perdew and levy @xcite , pathak @xcite , theophilou @xcite , oliveira , gross and kohn @xcite , nagy @xcite , sen @xcite , singh and deb @xcite .",
    "formal development @xcite akin to ground - state density functional theory , however , is more recent .",
    "a challenging problem in excited state dft is the construction of excited state energy functionals . without such functionals ,",
    "there is no option but to use the existing ground state energy functionals for excited states also .",
    "in such a case , the only way any information about the excited state can be put into energy is through the density alone @xcite .",
    "however , employing ground state functionals for excited states is both qualitative incorrect as well as numerically inaccurate @xcite .",
    "thus there is a need for development of appropriate excited - state energy functionals .",
    "starting point for most of the ground state functionals has been the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "building on this , gea @xcite and gga @xcite are further constructed .",
    "thus for excited states too one would like to first develop an lda functional and then improve upon it by including gradient corrections . in the past",
    ", we have proposed a systematic method of constructing lda functionals for excited states .",
    "this is done by splitting the @xmath0-space according to the orbital occupation of a given excited state @xcite .",
    "for example , in figure [ figure ] we show an excited state where some orbitals ( core ) are occupied , then some orbitals are vacant followed by orbitals that are occupied ( shell ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-space , also shown in figure [ figure ] , is constructed according to the orbital occupation such that it is occupied from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , vacant from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and again occupied from @xmath3 to @xmath4 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are determined by @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 in terms of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 corresponding to the electron densities of core , vacant ( unoccupied ) and the shell orbitals .",
    "further , @xmath11",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 where first @xmath14 orbitals are occupied , @xmath15 to @xmath16 are vacant followed by occupied orbitals from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . the total electron density @xmath19 is given as @xmath20 @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "approximate non - interacting kinetic energy functionals for such excited - states are constructed using the ground state energy functionals .",
    "thus while up to second order in @xmath24 , the ground state non - interacting kinetic energy is approximated as @xmath25 + t^{(2)}_s[\\rho ]    \\nonumber\\ ] ] where    @xmath26 & = & \\frac{1}{10\\pi^2}\\int k^5_f({\\bf r } )    d{\\bf r }   \\nonumber \\\\                  & = & \\frac{3}{10}(3\\pi^2)^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\int\\rho^{\\frac{5}{3}}({\\bf r } )    d{\\bf r } \\label{eq : tf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is the thomas - fermi kinetic energy functional with @xmath27 and @xmath28 = \\frac{1}{72}\\int\\frac{|\\nabla\\rho({\\bf r})|^2}{\\rho({\\bf r } ) } d{\\bf r } \\label{eq : gea2}\\ ] ] is the second - order gradient correction .",
    "the same functional can not be expected to be as good for excited states as it is for the ground states . for excited states ,",
    "the appropriate zeroth order approximation @xmath29 is given @xcite by the modified thomas - fermi kinetic energy functional @xmath30=\\frac{1}{10\\pi^2}\\int \\left(k^5_1({\\bf r})-k^5_2({\\bf r})+k^5_3({\\bf r } ) \\right)d{\\bf r } \\label{eq : exke0}\\ ] ] where the core term @xmath31 is approximated by @xmath32 and the shell part @xmath33 is approximated by @xmath34 d\\mathbf{r}$ ] .",
    "similarly , the construction is extended to the gradient correction up to the second - order by writing @xmath35 results obtained with these excited - state functionals for excited - states are far superior @xcite to those calculated with the use of the ground - state functionals .",
    "the method is quite general and is easily extended to excited state with more than one gap .",
    "for example , consider an excited state with two gaps with the orbital occupation of electrons shown in figure [ core - shell - shell ] .",
    "the corresponding split @xmath0-space is occupied from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( core - shell - shell structure ) . for these excited states ,",
    "the kinetic energy functional up to the second order is @xmath38 @xmath39        these functionals for spin - compensated systems ( unpolarized ) are easily generalized to their spin - density counterparts by writing @xmath40 = \\frac{1}{2}(t^{*}_\\textrm{unpol}[2\\rho_\\uparrow]+t^{*}_\\textrm{unpol}[2\\rho_\\downarrow ] ) \\label{eq : lsd}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the density of the up and the down spin electrons , respectively .",
    "results obtained with these functionals for two - gap excited states are shown in table [ tab - co - sh - sh ] , where we compare the excited kinetic energies calculated using and with the exact kohn - sham energies obtained by solving the kohn - sham equation with gunnarsson - lundquist parametrization @xcite of the lsd for exchange and correlation energy .",
    "the density used in equation and is the one obtained from the same kohn - sham calculations as done for exact kinetic energy .",
    "also shown in table [ tab - co - sh - sh ] are the corresponding energies calculated from the ground state kinetic energy functional @xmath43 and its gradient correction @xmath44 . as is evident from the table , the ground state based functionals",
    "underestimate the exact kinetic energies by a large amount whereas the proposed functionals reduce the error significantly .",
    "this points to the correctness of physics invoked to construct the functionals .",
    "similarly , the functional can also be applied to the shell - shell structure where the lowest energy orbitals are empty , and the next orbitals are occupied followed by some empty orbitals and again orbitals are occupied .",
    "the corresponding excited state functional is obtained by substituting @xmath45 in equations and .",
    "this kind of excited states is quite interesting because the error of ground state kinetic energy functionals in these is very large .",
    "this is shown in table [ tab - sh - sh ] .",
    "on the other hand excited state functionals of equations and again give energies which are far superior as is evident from table [ tab - sh - sh ] .",
    "finally we mention that we have also included the fourth order correction in a manner similar to above .",
    "the results obtained with the second - order do not change much with the inclusion of the fourth order .",
    "with this accurately constructed functionals based on writing the energy functional @xmath46 in terms of @xmath47 i.e @xmath48=e[k_1(\\rho_1(r)),k_2(\\rho_2(r)),k_3(\\rho_3(r)),\\cdots]$ ] , we ask if it is necessary to write the energy functional in terms of @xmath49 or can it be written in terms of the density @xmath50 directly .",
    "simple answer is that for homogeneous electron gas this can not be done because the density for the ground and any excited - state of the system is the same .",
    "thus information about the excited state can not come from density alone as also suggested by the bi - functional nature @xcite of excited state functionals . in this paper , we demonstrate more rigorously through response function analysis that excited - state energy functionals can not be written in terms of @xmath51 alone . we show that if we try to write the gea for kinetic energy using total @xmath50 , it leads to kinetic energy density that diverges .",
    "we conclude that although it may be possible to write excited energy functional in terms of the corresponding density for inhomogeneous systems in some other ways , it is most easily done if we instead employ the densities @xmath52 as done above .    in the following ,",
    "we first obtain the response function of non - interacting homogeneous electron gas and expand it to construct the kinetic energy functional correct up to the second - order in @xmath53 .",
    "we then show that the correction grows exponentially in the asymptotic regions of a finite system .",
    "suppose one could write the kinetic energy for an excited state of a homogeneous electron gas as @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the system is now made slightly inhomogeneous through a perturbation @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy up to the second order is obtained by expanding kinetic energy in density changes and is given as @xcite ,    @xmath56 = t^{*(0)}[\\rho ] + \\frac{1}{2 } \\iint k(|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'| ) \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) \\ \\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ' ) d\\mathbf{r } \\   d\\mathbf{r } '   \\label{tnfnal}\\ ] ]    in the fourier space , the total energy of the system , using @xmath57 , is @xmath58 = t^{*(0)}[\\rho ] + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } \\int k(\\mathbf{q } ) |\\rho(\\mathbf{q})|^2   d\\mathbf{q }                       + \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } \\int   v_{ext}(\\mathbf{q } ) \\rho(\\mathbf{q } ) d\\mathbf{q }    \\label{enfnal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the fourier transform of @xmath60 .",
    "making the energy stationary with respect to @xmath61 gives @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath59 is obtained by identifying @xmath63 with @xmath64 , where @xmath64 is the response function of non - interacting homogeneous electron gas obtained using perturbation theory and is given as @xmath65 + c.c   \\nonumber %   \\label{chiq - sum }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the volume over which periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the response function above for excited state corresponding to figure [ figure ] is given in a simple way as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the response function for the ground state with fermi wave vector @xmath0 and is given as @xmath70   \\label{chi - gr}\\ ] ] expanding @xmath71 to order @xmath72 leads to the second order correction for kinetic energy .",
    "for excited states , small @xmath73-limit gives @xmath74        \\right\\rbrace      \\nonumber\\ ] ] leading to @xmath75 \\right\\rbrace      \\nonumber\\ ] ] the excited state kinetic energy functional is then obtained by substituting @xmath59 in , so that @xmath76 & =   & t_0[\\rho ] +    \\frac{\\pi^2}{2 }   \\int   \\frac { \\left|\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\right|^2}{(k_1-k_2+k_3 ) } d\\mathbf{r } + \\frac{\\pi^2}{24 } \\int   \\frac{\\left|\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\right|^2}{(k_1-k_2+k_3)^2 }   \\left [ \\frac{1}{k_1 } -\\frac{1}{k_2 } + \\frac{1}{k_3 } \\right ] d\\mathbf{r } \\ \\",
    "\\label{final1 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term in the expression above is identified as @xmath77 of functional @xmath29 of equation .",
    "it is clear from the above that it can not be written in terms of @xmath78 alone . to check its correctness",
    "if we let @xmath79 , this term goes over to @xmath80 of functional @xmath81 of equation for the ground state .",
    "the third term above gives the gradient correction to the kinetic energy up to the second order in @xmath82 . upon substituting @xmath79",
    "this also goes correctly over to @xmath83 , the gradient correction for the ground state .",
    "however , for excited states , this term is not well behaved for @xmath84 . in this limit ,",
    "similar to ground state @xcite densities , excited - state density also varies @xcite as @xmath85 $ ] where @xmath86 is the highest occupied orbital energy .",
    "hence @xmath87 .",
    "for excited states @xmath88 so the gradient term in asymptotic limit is proportional to @xmath89 . in terms of orbital energies",
    "@xmath90 corresponding to @xmath91 and @xmath4 , shown in figure [ figure ] , this is given by @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "since , @xmath93 , the gradient term diverges in the asymptotic limit for @xmath94 if we insist on expanding the kinetic energy functional in terms of the density .",
    "this diverging behavior of the kinetic energy density is also an explicit demonstration of the lack of hohenberg - kohn theorem for excited states @xcite .",
    "thus additional input is needed @xcite if one wishes to employ excited state density for calculation . as shown by our results in the beginning of the paper ,",
    "this is done easily by dealing with @xmath95 and @xmath96 separately right from the beginning .",
    "indeed , the exchange energy functional constructed in a similar manner also leads to accurate results for excited state energies @xcite .",
    "exchange and kinetic energy lda functionals constructed by splitting @xmath0-space for homogeneous electron gas have been shown to be accurate in the past .",
    "analysis of the kinetic energy functional based on the response function of an excited - state of heg suggests that it is not possible to construct lda functionals that are dependent on excited state density alone .",
    "splitting the @xmath0-space and working with the corresponding core and shell densities separately thus provides a method of constructing density functionals for excited states and may pave the way to ground - state like density functional calculations for excited - states too .",
