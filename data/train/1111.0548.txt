    "tialn coatings with their good oxidation resistance and excellent mechanical properties have attracted high technological and academic interest @xcite .",
    "several studies have been devoted to discuss these alloys from different aspects to extend our understanding in maximizing their functionality and operational efficiency .",
    "the thermodynamics , phase stability and spinodal decomposition in tialn have been analyzed @xcite , also on the influence of nitrogen off - stoichiometry @xcite and pressure @xcite . furthermore , the theoretical prediction of the mixing enthalpy when alloying tialn with cr has resulted in a general design route to improve the thermal stability of hard coatings @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of the significant elastic anisotropy in tialn on the isostructural spinodal decomposition has been disccussed @xcite .",
    "though , the available theoretical tools with the help of modern supercomputers allows us to tackle such complex physical phenomena in alloys @xcite , the prediction of anisotropic tensorial materials properties of substitutional alloys from first principles remains a challenging and highly requested task in computational materials science @xcite .",
    "for example , in dynamical simulations suitably designed simulation cells can greatly reduce the computational costs of predicting the temperature dependence of the elastic and piezoelectric tensors of alloys .",
    "the importance of the elastic and piezoelectric tensors of materials can be underlined not only by its fundamental role in materials science but also their distinguished usage in ( micro)mechanical modeling , engineering or designing of machine elements , sensors , telecommunication devices , aircrafts , etc ..    although the ordinary scalar cluster expansion @xcite offers an exact treatment of the thermodynamics of alloys and its tensorial generalization @xcite gives the most elegant description of anisotropic tensorial materials quantities of alloys , the computationally less demanding and less complex special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) approach @xcite is _ more favorized _ due to its simplicity and success .",
    "for example the giant piezoelectric response of scaln alloys @xcite or the mechanical properties of tialn @xcite have been successfully described within this approach . using different superstructures , mayrhofer et al .",
    "have discussed the impact of the microscopic configurational freedom on the structural , elastic properties and phase stability in tialn @xcite . in b - doped wurtzite aln significant configurational dependence of the piezoelectric constant has been predicted @xcite with presuming wurtzite symmetry , similarly to the discussion of electronic properties and nonlinear macroscopic polarization in iii - v nitride alloys @xcite .",
    "in fact , in these studies the success of the sqs approach in describing the energetics of alloys is presumed for predicting tensorial materials properties when using different approximate sqs supercells or even ordered structures .",
    "these works were either only predictive on the materials constants or the confirmation of the applied approximate structural model was based on the experimental agreement of the results .",
    "moreover , most of the previous theoretical works on predicting elasticity and piezoelectricity of alloys presumed the experimentally observed symmetry for the modeling sqs supercells , though the substitutional disorder of the atoms in general breaks the local point symmetry of the supercell , and focused only on the corresponding principal symmetry non - equivalent tensor elements . while the symmetry arguments based tensorial version of the cluster expansion @xcite gives an exact approach to completely include the local point symmetry of the materials , improperly chosen sqs supercells may result in large discrepancy between theory and experiments or in erroneous theoretical findings .    the sqs approach , in principle ,",
    "is not aimed to generate structures with the inclusion of local point symmetry and thus to provide the proper , full description of tensorial properties of alloys .",
    "in fact , different sqs supercells break the symmetry somewhat differently and thus the comparison of the differently shaped and sized sqs supercells in terms of modeling the elasticity of cubic ti@xmath0al@xmath0n is a rather complex issue .",
    "hence , detailed systematic studies on the application of sqs supercells in predicting elastic constants of alloys are required to establish their performance and to determine their applicability limits .",
    "for example , j. von pezold _ et _ al .",
    "@xcite have recently evaluated the performance of symmetricaly shaped - ( @xmath14 ) , supercells for the description of elasticity in substitutional alti alloys and obtained convergence and error bars for the _ cubic - averaged _ principle cubic elastic constants within the supercell configuration space .",
    "however , a general concept of comparing and measuring different sized and shaped sqs supercells in describing tensorial materials properties is still lacking .    in this study",
    ", we present a general projection approach to establish a way of comparing the _ ab - initio _ calculated elastic constants of b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n obtained with applying different sized and shaped sqs supercells .",
    "we accurately predict and extensively discuss the calculation of the principal cubic elastic constants of b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n within the sqs approach . in general , we establish the importance of selecting proper sqs supercells with symmetry arguments to reliably model elasticity of alloys .",
    "namely , we show that supercells even with good short range order ( sro ) parameters may result in large non - cubic elastic constants and , on the contrary , supercells with bad sro parameters might approximate cubic elastic symmetry fairly accurately .",
    "we give the convergence of elasticity with respect to different sqs supercells for b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n via the symmetry projected cubic elastic constants .",
    "moreover , we suggest the calculation of 9 elastic tensor elements - @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , instead of 21 , to evaluate and analyze the performance of sqs supercells in predicting elasticity of cubic alloys .",
    "in this section we provide a description of the techniques we applied to calculate and analyze the approximate elastic constants of cubic b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n alloy .",
    "first we explain the applied special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) approach of modeling alloys and discuss the difficulties of describing the proper symmetric tensorial materials constants within the model .",
    "after that , we summarize the computational details of obtaining the energetics and extracting the elastic tensors of the approximate sqs supercells . finally , we present a general projection method that provides a technique to compare and analyze the calculated approximate elastic tensors and what establishes a principle to discuss the supercell models in terms of modeling elasticity with the inclusion of local point symmetry .",
    "the here described methodology is general enough to be applied for substitutional alloys with any symmetry and arbitrary composition .      the special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) approach @xcite greatly reduces the computational difficulties of modeling thermodynamics , mechanical and electronic materials properties of random alloys .",
    "the approach models the substitutional disordered alloys with ordered superstructures .",
    "the basic structural element of the sqs model is a supercell , what is aimed to capture the structural short range order ( sro ) in alloys while its periodic repetition introduces spatial long range order ( lro ) @xcite .",
    "the degree of sro is usually measured by the warren - cowley parameter @xcite , which for a pseudobinary a@xmath15b@xmath16n alloy is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the probability of finding a @xmath19 atom at a distance @xmath20 from an @xmath21 atom and @xmath22 stands for the concentration of @xmath19 .",
    "a perfectly random alloy is characterized by vanishing sro , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 define clustering and ordering , respectively . in terms of modeling disorder ,",
    "approximate sqs supercells with with small or vanishing sros up to a certain neighboring order can be compared if and only if the interaction parameters are also known . in this work",
    "the atomic configurations in the supercells were obtained by including the warren - cowley sro parameters of the first seven nearest - neighboring shells .",
    "namely , the disorder has been considered up to the seventh neighboring shell on the metal sublattice .",
    "accordingly , the sro parameters were calculated only on the ti - sublattice . in order to achieve the closest possible model of the perfectly random alloy in",
    "the chosen sized and shaped supercell approximation @xmath25 , a metropolis - type simulated annealing algorithm @xcite has been applied with a cost - function built from the properly weighted nearest - neighbor sro parameters .    the sqs supercell approach in general breaks the local point symmetry at different stages .",
    "the substitutional disorder changes the microscopic local environments which results also in some distorsions on the lattice parameters .",
    "namely , after full relaxation the supercells will have a general triclinic shape",
    ". moreover , the sqs approach in modeling the substitutional disorder of alloys allows one to apply arbitrary supercell shape and size - @xmath25 in terms of lattice vectors .",
    "this arbitrariness though increases the variational freedom to obtain closely vanishing sro parameters with relative small supercell size at any alloy composition , it also spoils the symmetry of the model .",
    "thus , the elasticity of the b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n alloy is modeled with fully relaxed sqs supercells an it is described by 21 elastic constants , instead of the three principal cubic constants , @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "namely , in the sqs approach the elastic tensor of the model belongs to a symmetry class that is lower than the one that the alloy shows experimentally .",
    "furthermore , different sqs supercells break the symmetry somewhat differently , which means that the comparison of the results can only be done after certain alignment . in this study",
    "we show that a projection technique can provide such an alignment in the example of the b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n alloy .      to obtain total energies and extract the elastic constants of the supercells introduced above",
    ", density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have been performed with using the plane - wave ultrasoft pseudo - potential @xcite based quantum espresso program package @xcite .",
    "the exchange correlation energy was approximated by the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient functional ( pbe - gga ) @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff energy together with the monkhorst - pack sampling @xcite of the brillouine zone were tested and sufficient convergence was achieved .",
    "the pseudopotentials were downloaded from the library linked to quantum espresso and tested by calculating the elasticity of bulk b1 aln and tin in agreement with literature values @xcite . in obtaining the ground state structure of the modeling supercells ,",
    "both the lattice parameters and the internal atomic coordinates were relaxed by using the extended molecular dynamics method with variable cell shape introduced by wentzcovitch @xcite .",
    "accordingly , during the relaxation the supercells geometries have been changed from the initial cubic - like lattice structure and converged to a slightly distorted triclinic shape with vanishing stress tensor .",
    "thus , we avoid any residual structural stresses , which is essential in performing an accurate comparative analysis of the calculated elastic tensors . in this dynamics ,",
    "a value of 0.02 kbar was taken as convergence threshold for the pressure .",
    "the elastic constants were calculated via the second order taylor expansion coefficients of the total energy @xmath26 where voigt s notation is used to describe the strain @xmath27 and elastic @xmath28 tensor @xcite . to obtain the entire elastic tensor , namely the 21 elastic constants of each supercell ,",
    "21 different distorsions have been applied without volume conservation .",
    "the elastic constants were calculated by standard finite difference technique from total energy data obtained from @xmath29 1% and @xmath292% distorsions .      in this section",
    "we describe the projection technique introduced by moakher et al .",
    "@xcite to obtain the closest elastic tensor with higher symmetry class for any given elastic tensor with arbitrary symmetry .",
    "this projection technique allows us to extract the largest cubic part of the calculated elastic tensors .",
    "it introduces a tool to compare the obtained approximate elastic tensors and measure the appropriateness of the sqs supercells in modeling the elasticity of b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n .",
    "the symmetric elastic tensor has 21 inequivalent elements for the most general triclinic system .",
    "a system with higher point symmetry requires less parameters in describing its elastic behavior .",
    "for example , with cubic symmetry the material has only 3 principal elastic constants , @xmath30 and @xmath11 , while the hexagonal point symmetry results in 5 elastic constants , @xmath31 and @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , any elastic tensor can be expressed as a vector in a 21 dimensional vector space , with the following components @xmath32 where the @xmath33 s ensure the invariance of the norm on the representation , whether it is vector or matrix .",
    "for the basis vectors see ref.@xcite .",
    "the following projectors @xmath34 generate the closest elastic tensor with higher symmetry via @xmath35 where @xmath36 has higher point symmetry .",
    "the term closest here is used in the sense , that the euclidean distance @xmath37 is minimum .    to obtain the closest cubic approximate in our study of b1 ti@xmath0al@xmath0n",
    ", we applied the projector given as a 21@xmath3821 matrix , @xmath39 & & p^{\\text{cub}}=\\begin{pmatrix } 1/3&1/3&1/3&0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\ 1/3&1/3&1/3&0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\ 1/3&1/3&1/3&0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1/3&1/3&1/3&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1/3&1/3&1/3&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1/3&1/3&1/3&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&1/3&1/3&1/3\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&1/3&1/3&1/3\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&1/3&1/3&1/3\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{cubic_proj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] accordingly , the projected cubic elastic constants can be achieved via the following simple averaging , @xmath40 we can call them cubic - averaged elastic constants , since the equation is equivalent with averaging over the three orthogonal directions , [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] .",
    "we note here that this averaging was used by von pezold _ et _ al . in searching for optimized supercell in alti alloys .",
    "thus , to obtain the closest cubic projection of an elastic tensor with arbitrary symmetry one needs to derive 9 different distorsion and calculate 9 independent tensor elements , like @xmath41 and @xmath13 . in case of cubic symmetry eq.([cubic_average ] ) results in the well - known cubic identities of the elastic constants , see eq.([cubic_sym ] ) .    for modeling elasticity in hexagonal alloys , one needs the closest hexagonal approximation that can be obtained via the projector @xmath42 that acts in the same 9 dimensional subspace and results in the following expressions for the projected hexagonal elastic constants , @xmath43    a detailed derivation of the projectors for the all symmetry classes , monoclinic , orthorombic , tetragonal , trigonal , hexagonal , cubic and isotropic can be found in ref .",
    "it is worth to mention that not all projectors can be defined in the above used 9 dimensional subspace .",
    "furthermore , the application of this projection technique allows one to spilt the elastic tensor into a direct sum of tensors with different symmetry .",
    "such decomposition is possible , for example , on the following routes , @xmath44 thus , with calculating the norm of the components one gets information about the different contributions and can analyze elastic anisotropy in general @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a comparative analysis of the calculated approximate elastic tensors obtained for the cubic ( b1 ) tia@xmath0l@xmath0n alloy within the special quasirandom structure approach . to get different levels of the approximation of the elasticity in cubic ti@xmath0al@xmath0n ,",
    "several approximate sqs supercell models have been generated with different shape and size , such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "here sqs supercell sizes are measured in terms of the fcc unit vectors . to have a more complete comparison of the calculated elastic tensors , we present results obtained with the ordered l1@xmath51 structure and three other structures , denoted here by c1-@xmath45 , c3-@xmath45 and b1-@xmath45 .",
    "these three structures are not based on the fcc unit cell but on the fcc bravais cell .",
    "the c1-@xmath45 and c3-@xmath45 was created by mayrhofer et al .",
    "@xcite with considering the number of bonds between the host and doping atoms .",
    "the c3-@xmath45 structure was designed with preserving the cubic symmetry .",
    "the b1-@xmath45 structure was obtained by von pezold with using a monte - carlo scheme and averaging over the three orthogonal main crystallographic directions .",
