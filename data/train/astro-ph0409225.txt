    "for stars on the main - sequence two mechanisms are known to generate x - ray emission : in o- and early b - type stars the x - rays are produced by instabilities arising in the strong radiatively driven stellar winds ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and in late - type stars a solar - like magnetic dynamo is thought to produce the observed x - ray activity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "no x - ray emission is expected from stars whose spectral types are late b and early a , because they do not drive strong enough winds nor do they possess convective zones necessary to sustain a magnetic dynamo .",
    "therefore , their x - ray detection which has repeatedly been reported throughout the literature ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) has remained a mystery to date .",
    "lacking any theoretical model for x - ray production intrinsic to intermediate - mass stars , the observed emission is commonly attributed to unresolved late - type companions . in order to check this hypothesis",
    "@xcite carried out _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) x - ray observations of visual binaries composed of late - b type stars and known visual companions at separations @xmath0 , i.e. those clearly resolvable by the hri . in these observations only in @xmath1 out of @xmath2 cases the x - ray emission could be ascribed to the late - type companion . on the other hand , a _ rosat _",
    "hri study of visual binary systems comprised of early - type stars and post - t tauri stars ( also known as lindroos systems ) , has shown that both the late - b type primaries and their late - type companions emit x - rays at similar levels ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity of the x - ray properties of the lindroos primaries and secondaries supports the hypothesis that the x - ray emission from the late b - type stars in fact originates from closer late - type companions unresolvable by the _ rosat _",
    "since a large fraction of the x - ray detected late b - type stars belong to rather young ( @xmath3yrs ) stellar groups ( e.g. , scoob2 , carina - vela , tucanae ) , most of the predicted unresolved late - type stars may be young stars still contracting to the main - sequence ( ms ) or just arrived on the zero - age ms , if bound to the primaries .",
    "thanks to an observationally established but theoretically poorly understood enhancement of magnetic activity at young stellar ages , late - type pre - ms stars ( = t tauri stars ) are ubiquitous x - ray sources .",
    "the picture is less clear for their higher - mass counterparts , the haebe stars .",
    "when starting their evolution fully convective they may drive magnetic activity by the same process as t tauri stars , or by magnetic interaction between the star and an accretion disk ( as proposed by @xcite for proto - stars ) .",
    "@xcite argue that intermediate - mass stars may be able to maintain dynamo action also throughout the first part ( several percent ) of their radiative phase . on the other hand , close visual companions to",
    "haebe stars have been presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations by @xcite have suggested that almost all haebe stars have companions within a completeness limit of @xmath4 sep @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the x - ray emission from haebe stars has been investigated systematically by @xcite based on _",
    "observations and by @xcite using _",
    "rosat_. about @xmath7% and @xmath8% of the observed haebe stars were detected , respectively . according to @xcite the most plausible origin of these detections are their winds .",
    "on the other hand , x - ray flares have been detected on a small number of haebe stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and have been taken as evidence for magnetic activity . _",
    "einstein _ and _ rosat _ observations did not resolve the haebe stars from the companions identified in the publications cited above .",
    "solving the puzzle of x - ray emission from intermediate - mass stars calls for a complex observational approach involving imaging and spectroscopic observations in different wavelength bands . our strategy to test",
    "the companion hypothesis is as follows : ( i ) search for cool companions to a- and b - type stars with high - resolution imaging observations in the ir using the adaptive optics ( ao ) technique , ( ii ) follow - up x - ray observations with similarly high spatial resolution to pinpoint the x - ray emitter in the newly identified systems , ( iii ) ir spectroscopy for those intermediate - mass stars that are x - ray detected even after being resolved from any ( sub-)arcsecond visual companions to search for even closer companions .    throughout this article",
    ", we will for simplicity call any faint ir object near the intermediate - mass stars of interest ` companions ' .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the objects newly discovered in ao imaging have not been confirmed yet to be physically bound to the ` primaries ' .",
    "true late - type companions to ms b - type stars are expected to be young , because of the different evolutionary time - scales of early- and late - type stars .",
    "optical spectroscopy should reveal a lii absorption feature at @xmath9   in physical companions proving their pre - ms nature . but",
    "no observations have been carried out yet to that effect .",
    "work on the three sub - projects introduced above has started in parallel . here",
    "we report on the first results of    * ao imaging of early - a type stars in the northern hemisphere at the telescopio nazionale galilei ( tng ) on la palma ; * _ chandra _ x - ray observations of late - b type stars for which the recent ao studies of @xcite and @xcite have identified ao companions ; * ir spectroscopy of x - ray emitting late - b type stars at the thringer landessternwarte tautenburg .",
    "previous ao searches for faint companions to ( x - ray emitting ) intermediate - mass ms stars have been carried out in the southern hemisphere ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have provided a wealth of new candidate companions , but have been restricted to the higher - mass end of the ` x - ray forbidden ' range of spectral types . since the final aim is to prove / disprove the existence of the theoretically predicted gap in x - ray emission along the spectral type sequence , and to understand its point of onset , we must sample the whole critical range of spectral types .",
    "therefore we have engaged in ao observations of a - type stars .",
    "the sample was selected from the catalogue of optically bright main - sequence stars detected during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen stars with spectral types ranging between a0 and a5 and without indications of binarity according to the _ hipparcos _ and wielen catalogues ( @xcite , @xcite ) . with this latter criterion",
    "we minimize the probability that spectroscopic binaries are included in our sample .",
    "in contrast to previous studies our targets are located in the northern sky .",
    "so far we have obtained @xmath10- and @xmath11-band images of @xmath12 early - a type stars using the small field of the near infrared camera spectrometer ( nics ) at the tng .",
    "combined with the ao system the field - of - view is @xmath13 . as a first result we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : tng ] the reduced frame for hr7826 , an a3v star with no reports on binarity in the literature .",
    "dark patches result from the subtraction of the science frames effected to eliminate the contribution of the sky background .",
    "the white ( black ) objects that  together with the main negative ( positive )  delineate a square - shaped region are ghosts .",
    "potential companion stars are to be found among the remaining bright point - like features .",
    "indeed , several of them have already known 2mass counterparts , marked with white circles and numbers for identification with the 2mass image aside .",
    "the large circle overplotted on the image denotes a separation of @xmath14 from the b - type star . on the right hand side in the same figure",
    "we show the corresponding 2mass image .",
    "obviously , in 2mass no faint sources can be detected within the critical region of @xmath15 around the bright b - star due to the poor spatial resolution of this survey .",
    "a thorough analysis of this tng image and those of the other targets will produce a substantial list of new companion candidates .",
    "these new objects shall then be considered in follow - up _ chandra _ observations and optical spectroscopy .",
    "_ chandra _ is the first and so far only x - ray satellite providing spatial resolution comparable with ao observations .",
    "in addition it provides spectral capabilities that give information about the properties of the x - ray emitting plasma , such as temperature and luminosity , which can be used to constrain the nature of the target .    within this project @xmath16",
    "late - b type stars on the ms were observed with _",
    "s advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the targets have shown to be x - ray emitters in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey (= rass ; @xcite ) and they have ao companions from the work of @xcite with separations ranging from @xmath17 , i.e. the systems are well resolvable with _ chandra_. this sample is complemented by data of two stars extracted from the _ chandra _ archive , that obey the same criteria : spectral type late - b , on the ms , x - ray sources according to the rass , and close companions resolvable with _ chandra_. some of the targets are lindroos systems ( @xcite ) , and have additional companions at wider separations .",
    "we searched for x - rays also at the position of these lindroos secondaries .",
    "in addition we scanned the _",
    "archive for any observations of haebe stars , and found @xmath18 of them . some of these data have been published by @xcite and @xcite , others are serendipitous sources of pointings with a different scope .",
    "we point out that the haebe star sample diverges from the original selection criterion , in that many of them are not known to have close visual companions .",
    "but they are of interest to our study because the physical processes related with their x - ray emission may be different from those of the more evolved ms b / a - type stars . a comparison between x - ray properties of haebe and ms b / a - type stars should allow to test whether and where there is an age - related transition or shut - off in the dynamo action .",
    "an example for the _ chandra _ imaging observations is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ao_xray_images ] , which shows the acis exposure of hd1685 , together with the corresponding ao discovery image of the ` companion ' at the 3.6 m telescope of eso ( chile ) .",
    "two x - ray sources are seen , that can be identified with the b - type primary and the ao companion , respectively .    to summarize , almost all of the new ir sources turn out to be x - ray emitters : only one of them is undetected with _ chandra _ , but it is probably a faint source just below the detection sensitivity ( see discussion in @xcite where the first @xmath19 targets have been presented ) . however , this does not prove the companion hypothesis , as we have detected also @xmath20 out of @xmath21 b - type stars .",
    "one of them is known to be a spectroscopic binary , the other @xmath22 b - type stars remain candidates for being intrinsic emitters until tested for closer companions with ir spectroscopy ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : irspec ] ) .",
    "previously known lindroos companions at separations @xmath23 are present in hd113703 , hd129791 , hd32964 and hd123445 .",
    "the latter two are undetected , suggesting that they may not form bound systems with the ` primary ' .",
    "indeed  consistent with our x - ray observations  the lindroos companions of hd32964 and hd123445 have been labeled as likely optical pairs , while the lindroos companions of hd113703 and hd129791 have been dubbed likely physical based on their optical photometry and spectroscopy ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    among the haebe stars @xmath24 out of @xmath18",
    "are detected with _ chandra_. whether the higher detection fraction with respect to the ms b - type stars indicates a different emission mechanism or is the result of hidden companions remains unclear so far .",
    "if all x - rays from the position of intermediate - mass stars are assumed to be generated by late - type companion stars the higher detection rate of haebe stars could also be due to higher activity levels of their companions , because of their younger age with respect to the companions of ms stars .",

    "<S> s unprecedented spatial resolution allows to check whether the new infrared sources are responsible for the x - ray emission previously ascribed to the a / b - type star . </S>",
    "<S> finally , those a / b - type stars that are still detected with chandra are studied with ir spectroscopy , where we search for temperature sensitive features indicating the existence of even closer cool companions . even with this multi - fold strategy we are likely to miss the closest of the possible companions , but a study of the x - ray properties can provide further information on the nature of the emitters . </S>"
