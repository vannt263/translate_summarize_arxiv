    "following the fundamental neutron scattering observations of tranquada@xcite , there has been a vigorous resurgence@xcite in the study of states of two - dimensional strongly correlated systems which break various types of translational symmetries ( to be precise : we will consider translational symmetry to be broken when an observable invariant under spin rotations ( and which does not change the net charge of the system ) does not remain invariant under the space - group of the lattice ) . in an early discussion of translational symmetry breaking in two - dimensional antiferromagnets@xcite",
    "it was argued that any quantum paramagnet accessed by a continuous quantum transition from a nel state must have ( for @xmath0 spins ) ( _ i _ ) broken translational symmetry due to spin - peierls ( or _ bond_-charge density ) ordering , and ( _ ii _ ) confinement of spin-1/2 excitations resulting in integer spin quasiparticle modes . other early work@xcite used hartree - fock theory to study the formation of _",
    "site_-charge density order in lightly doped antiferromagnets . in this paper",
    ", we shall review recent work@xcite in which these two apparently divergent physical effects were studied in a combined footing ",
    "we shall argue that such an analysis leads to considerable physical insight and has significant experimental implications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ins ] we will consider translational symmetry breaking in the quantum paramagnetic phases of insulating antiferromagnets  this will be done using lattice ` height ' and ising models which are obtained after a duality transformation . in section  [ dope ] we will turn to the recent results@xcite on doped antiferromagnets , and their implication for experiments .",
    "a convenient and physically transparent framework for discussing the physics of the low - lying singlet excitations of a quantum paramagnet is the `` quantum dimer model''@xcite . at first glance",
    ", the formulation of the dimer model does appear rather arbitrary , with a number of ad hoc assumptions which obscure the connection to the heisenberg antiferromagnet ",
    "instead , the dimer model is best viewed as a caricature which captures some essential pieces of the physics .",
    "we shall mainly use the dimer model as an intuitive intermediate step towards introducing dual ` height ' and ising models .",
    "these dual models have also been derived by a number of other methods , including systematic semiclassical and large @xmath1 expansions@xcite , and these provide the more formal justifications for the arguments here .",
    "we will describe duality transformations on an effective model of resonating singlet bonds which show that unfrustrated antiferromagnets are described by an effective height model in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite ; in the presence of frustration , the height model gets modified to a fully frustrated , two - dimensional ising model in a transverse field@xcite .",
    "all of the results in this section were derived and published some time ago@xcite ; the frustrated ising model was derived by one of us@xcite and the main results were outlined in ref.@xcite , but details have not been previously published .",
    "the presentation of the details here was motivated by the reappearance of the same ising model in a recent study of the competition between antiferromagnetism and d - wave superconductivity by senthil and fisher@xcite .",
    "we also note another recent study of lattice gauge theory models of two - dimensional antiferromagnets by nagaosa and lee@xcite ; they examine theories related to those considered in ref@xcite and in the present paper , but their actions do not contain the crucial berry phase terms ( as in ( [ f10a ] ) , ( [ f10 ] ) , and ( [ g10 ] ) ) associated with the non - zero net matter density on each site even in the undoped antiferromagnet  it is these berry phase terms which are responsible for frustration in the dual height or ising spin representation , and we believe their incorporation is essential for a proper description of the physics .",
    "the central assertion of the dimer model is that it is appropriate identify the hilbert space of the low - lying singlet excitations of the quantum paramagnet on a square lattice with a set of dimer coverings@xcite .",
    "each dimer covering corresponds to different singlet state , and off - diagonal matrix elements between such states therefore lead to a `` resonance '' between the dimers .",
    "such resonance terms must preserve the constraint of one and exactly one dimer terminating at every site , and this severely restricts their form .",
    "two possible resonating terms are illustrated in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "one might now anticipate that the ground state of such a resonating - valence - bond hamiltonian is a liquid - like superposition of all dimer coverings , but this turns out not to be the case .",
    "the ground state in fact breaks lattice translational symmetry@xcite _",
    "e.g. _ for some range of parameters it looks like the columnar ordered state at the top of fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "there is a simple intuitive reason for this : the columnar state has the maximum number of plaquettes about which the dimers are able to resonate and still preserve the local constraints .",
    "this resonance lowers its energy , and this effect is strong enough that the system always picks out one of the four columnar states and retains memory of its orientation .",
    "the ordering is therefore due to a quantum `` order - from - disorder '' effect .",
    "let us now make these arguments more precise .",
    "we will divide our discussion into two subsections .",
    "section  [ bm ] will consider the model with dimers connecting nearest neighbors on the square lattice .",
    "more generally , the results here will apply to bipartite lattices in which the dimers only connect sites on opposite sublattices .",
    "we will show that such models here are described by effective height models in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite .",
    "section  [ nb ] will consider models in which the dimers are allowed to connect sites on the same sublattice  the effective model for these will be the fully frustrated ising model in a transverse field@xcite .",
    "we will only discuss the case of the nearest - neighbor , square lattice dimer model here .",
    "we identify the dimers by site , @xmath2 , of the square lattice on their lower or left end .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number operator for the dimer on site @xmath2 oriented in the @xmath4 direction ( @xmath5 ) ; @xmath6 indicates the sublattice of site @xmath2 , and equals @xmath7 on one sublattice and @xmath8 on the other .",
    "we have so far considered only a @xmath0 antiferromagnet , but for general @xmath9 there will be exactly @xmath10 dimers emerging from every site  this constraint translates to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the discrete lattice derivative in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the factors of @xmath6 where introduced so that the constraint would have the gauss - law form in ( [ f1 ] ) , and the operator @xmath13 is seen to be the analog of the electric field@xcite .",
    "we also introduce an angular phase variable , @xmath14 ( the analog of a compact @xmath15 gauge field ) , on every link which is canonically conjugate to @xmath16 : @xmath17 = i \\delta_{ij } \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta } , \\label{f2}\\ ] ] where it should be clear from the context when we mean @xmath18 , and when @xmath2 is a site label .",
    "we can now write down the hamiltonian of the dimer model : @xmath19 the first term , proportional to @xmath20 is only non - trivial when @xmath21 , and it ensures that the density of dimers is as uniform as possible .",
    "it follows from the commutation relations ( [ f2 ] ) that the second term , proportional to @xmath22 , flips dimers around a plaquette and so induces the ` resonance ' shown in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we will now write down a path integral representation of the partition function of @xmath23 by following a standard route .",
    "we insert complete sets of @xmath24 eigenstates at small imaginary time intervals @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix elements of the cosine term in @xmath23 are evaluated by replacing it with the villain periodic gaussian form ( this is the only ` approximation ' made in our duality mappings - all other transformations below are exact ) : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is an integer - valued field on the sites , @xmath28 , of the dual lattice ; there is an obvious relationship between the location of the direct lattice site , @xmath2 , and the dual lattice site @xmath28 , but we will not specify it explicitly to avoid cluttering up the notation ( we will consistently use the labels @xmath29 for sites on the direct lattice , and the labels @xmath30 for sites on the dual lattice ) . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath28 resides at the center of plaquette around which the ` flux ' @xmath31 resonates the dimers .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce a three - vector notation in space time : we define the integer - valued ` electromagnetic flux ' vector @xmath32 on the dual lattice sites , where the index @xmath33 ( we will consistently use the labels @xmath34 to represent spatial components only , while @xmath35 will represent three - dimensional spacetime components ) . here",
    "@xmath36 refer to the integer eigenvalues of the operator @xmath24 which are summed over in each time step .",
    "now the partition function of @xmath23 can be written in the compact form @xmath37 here the sum is over the integer - valued field @xmath38 which resides on the sites of the dual cubic lattice in spacetime ; the delta function constraint imposes ` gauss s law ' ( [ f1 ] ) and the ` maxwell equation ' between @xmath39 and @xmath40 which follows from the matrix elements of ( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the time spacing @xmath25 has been chosen so that the coupling @xmath41 .",
    "we now solve the constraint in ( [ f5 ] ) by writing @xmath42 as the sum of a particular solution and the general solution of the homogeneous equation : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a fluctuating integer - valued field on the dual lattice sites , while @xmath45 is a _ fixed _",
    "field independent of @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 a convenient choice is to take @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 as shown in fig  [ fig2]a , taking the values @xmath51 on every second column of sites and zero otherwise .",
    ", @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the circles ( crosses ) are the sites of the direct ( dual ) lattice . in ( c ) , only the @xmath54 component of @xmath53 is non - zero and its values are shown . ,",
    "width=384 ]    for future manipulations , it is convenient to split @xmath45 into curl - free and divergence - free parts by writing @xmath55 where again @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fixed fields independent of @xmath46 and their values are shown in fig  [ fig2]b , c ; @xmath52 takes the values @xmath56 on the four dual sublattices , while @xmath57 .",
    "we have now assembled all the ingredients necessary for the final representations of the partition function .",
    "there are three different formulations , and each present a valuable physical perspective and can be used for further quantitative analysis .",
    "we will present them in turn in the following subsections .",
    "we insert ( [ f6 ] ) into ( [ f5 ] ) and obtain the height model partition function @xmath58 for the purposes of this section , it is convenient to insert the decomposition ( [ f7 ] ) in ( [ e3a ] ) and obtain@xcite @xmath59 where the ` heights ' @xmath60 are defined by @xmath61 notice that @xmath62 has dropped out  this is a general property of all representations of bipartite dimer models , but the non - bipartite models in section  [ nb ] will depend upon @xmath62 .",
    "we can view @xmath60 as the heights of a 3-dimensional interface which are restricted to take values equal ( for @xmath0 ) to those in fig  [ fig2]b plus arbitrary integers .",
    "it is instructive to note here , for @xmath0 , a direct connection between these heights and the original dimer model we began with@xcite . for large @xmath63",
    ", the partition function @xmath64 will be dominated by configurations in which neighboring heights are as close to each other as possible ; the manifold of minimum action is defined by heights which satisfy @xmath65 if we consider two height configurations to be equivalent if they differ only by a constant integer shift @xmath66 , then the set of all such equivalence classes is precisely equivalent to the set of dimer coverings .",
    "the identification is illustrated in fig  [ fig3 ] : neighboring heights differ either by large ( 3/4 ) or small ( 1/4 ) steps , and we place a dimer on every link intersecting a large step .     satisfying ( [ e2 ] ) and the corresponding dimer covering .",
    ", width=192 ]      promote the integer valued field @xmath44 to a real - valued field @xmath67 by the poisson summation formula . after shifting the real field by @xmath68",
    "we obtain from ( [ f5],[f6],[f7 ] ) @xmath69 if we now truncate the summation over @xmath70 by adding a fugacity @xmath71 , then @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is seen to be a version of the sine - gordon field theory in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite .",
    "define @xmath74 ; so @xmath75 is an integer - valued field satisfying the constraints @xmath76 we impose these constraints by a real lagrange multiplier field @xmath77 by inserting factors of @xmath78 in @xmath79 in ( [ e3a ] ) .",
    "the sum over the @xmath75 can now be performed using the poisson summation formula and we obtain after using ( [ curlx ] ) @xmath80 where the @xmath81 extend over all integers . @xmath82 is easily seen to be the villain form of the partition function of a compact @xmath15 gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "there is an additional berry phase carried by the world lines of the background charge density of @xmath83 particles on each site .",
    "an alternative , and exactly equivalent , form of @xmath82 can be obtained by applying the above transformation to @xmath64 ( in ( [ e3 ] ) ) rather than to @xmath79 .",
    "then , exactly the same steps lead to @xmath84 the instanton number of the gauge theory is @xmath85 , and to the berry phase is now carried by the instantons : each instanton has a berry phase of @xmath86 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that precisely the _ same berry phase _ was obtained in very different semiclassical and large @xmath1 analysis of bipartite antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "it is also worth reiterating that @xmath82 ( in which the berry phase is carried by the world lines of the @xmath83 particles on each site ) and @xmath87 ( in which the berry phase is associated with the instantons ) are exactly equivalent@xcite  they merely do the book - keeping of the total berry phase somewhat differently .",
    "the properties of the theories @xmath64 , @xmath73 , and @xmath87 are reasonably well understood and have been described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the height model is in a smooth phase phase for all values of @xmath63 ( there is no roughening transition ) , while the compact @xmath15 gauge theory is always confining . in terms of the underlying dimer model",
    ", this means that translational symmetry is spontaneously broken and the dimers crystallize in a bond - charge ordered state .",
    "a likely configuration is the columnar state in fig  [ fig1]a , but it is not ruled out that one of these theories could exhibit a transition to some other confining state in which the details of the lattice symmetry breaking are different : another state@xcite which occurs in the parameter space of @xmath73 is the plaquette state of fig  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we will now relax the constraint that the dimers must connect sites on opposite sublattices .",
    "we will show that such a step reduces the height model to a 2 + 1 dimensional fully frustrated ising model in a transverse field , following the derivation@xcite outlined in ref@xcite .",
    "an example of a dimer state connecting sites on the same sublattice is shown in fig  [ fig5]a .",
    "notice that a pair of such ` diagonal ' dimers can resonate with a pair of dimers connecting opposite sublattices .    , and this is the key factor which controls their effect on the long distance physics . , width=288 ]    however models which include terms like those in fig  [ fig5]a do not appear to be amenable to the _ exact _ duality transformations we have considered in section  [ bm ] .",
    "so we have two alternatives for further analysis : we could be satisfied by approximate duality transformations on models which include the resonance in fig  [ fig5]a , or we could modify the underlying dimer model to allow duality to proceed smoothly . both alternatives lead to essentially the same final result , but we will choose the latter for presentation here as it more clearly isolates the approximation made .",
    "the modification of the dimer model is aided by the physical picture developed in the large-@xmath1 theories of the effects of frustration presented in refs @xcite .",
    "the key property of the diagonal dimers in fig  [ fig5]a is that they connect sites on the same sublattice , and such dimers carry net charge @xmath88 under the compact qed representation of section  [ cqed ] .",
    "this will be shown explicitly in more detail below , but can be seen quickly as follows . from the representation ( [ f10a ] ) we see that the model behaves as if there are background charges of @xmath89 on one sublattice , and charges of @xmath90 on the other sublattice .",
    "a dimer connecting sites on opposite sublattices absorbs ( in the gauss law constraint ( [ f1 ] ) ) charges of @xmath51 on its two ends ; so such a dimer has net charge 0 .",
    "however we do need a vector potential for a gauge invariant connection between the charges on the two ends , and this is why the number operator of the dimer @xmath91 ( see ( [ f2 ] ) ) .",
    "let us now apply the same argument to the diagonal dimers of fig[fig5]a .",
    "these connect sites on the same sublattice and therefore carry net charge @xmath88 ; however , we also need a vector potential to connect such spatially separated charges , and so the number operator of a diagonal operator must also contain the necessary path integral of @xmath92 .",
    "it is this combined role of diagonal dimers that precludes a straightforward duality transformation , but it also suggests a simplifying modification : the important thing is that the dimer carry charge @xmath88 while preserving the fact that each site has net charge @xmath93 ; so we collapse the two ends of the diagonal dimers onto the same site , as in fig  [ fig5]b .",
    "the resulting _ monomer _ trivially satisfies the requirement of representing a singlet bond between electrons on the same sublattice and thus carries charge @xmath88 ; moreover , no vector potential is required as the charges on its two ends are on the same spatial location .",
    "further , such monomers can resonate , like the diagonal dimers , between dimers connecting sites on opposite sublattices , as shown in fig  [ fig5 ] .",
    "of course such a model requires that the number of singlet bonds allowed to emerge from a site be at least two _ i.e. _ @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , we maintain that generic properties of the model studied here apply also to @xmath0 models with configurations such as those in fig  [ fig5]a .",
    "let us now write down the hamiltonian of the monomer - dimer model containing the resonance in fig  [ fig5]b .",
    "let @xmath95 be the monomer number operator on site @xmath2 .",
    "then the constraint that there are exactly @xmath83 singlet bonds emerging from site @xmath2 modifies the ` gauss law ' constraint ( [ f1 ] ) to @xmath96 this equation shows that in addition to the background ` charge ' of @xmath83 , there is@xcite , as claimed above , a fluctuating charge density of a ` higgs field ' of monomers of charge 2 .",

    "the procedure will closely parallel that followed in section  [ bm ] .",
    "we insert complete sets of @xmath24 and @xmath104 eigenstates at intervals of imaginary time @xmath25 in the partition function . as in ( [ f4 ] ) , we replace the exponential of the new cosine term proportional to @xmath100 by a villain form but with a decoupling field @xmath105 . after evaluating the matrix elements between the complete sets of states , defining the three - vector integer - valued ` current ' @xmath106 we find that @xmath107 in ( [ f5 ] ) is replaced by @xmath108 where , for simplicity , we have chosen the coupling @xmath109 .",
    "the sum in ( [ g5 ] ) is over integer valued fields @xmath38 , on the dual lattice , and @xmath110 on the direct lattice .",
    "the solution of the constraints analogous to ( [ f6 ] ) is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is an integer - valued ` gauge ' field on the links of the dual lattice , while , as before , @xmath44 is an integer - valued height field on the sites of the dual lattice . inserting ( [ g6 ] ) into ( [ g5 ] )",
    "we obtain the generalization of the height model ( [ e3a ] ) @xmath113 we will refer to this partition function as the ` gauged height model ' ; the form ( [ g7 ] ) is the most convenient for subsequent analysis and is one of the key expressions of this paper .",
    "we also note an alternative form of @xmath114 , analogous to ( [ e3 ] ) , obtained by inserting ( [ f7 ] ) into ( [ g7 ] ) @xmath115 where the heights @xmath116 are defined in ( [ defh ] ) .",
    "as promised earlier , @xmath53 does not drop out of the models of this subsection .",
    "the main remaining task is to describe the physical properties of the gauged height model ( [ g7 ] ) ; we will embark on this in section  [ gh ] .",
    "however , before we do so , we will , for completeness , present the analog of the compact qed models of section  [ cqed ] .",
    "we apply the method of section  [ cqed ] to @xmath114 .",

    "@xmath122 respectively , and performing the summation over @xmath75 and @xmath123 by the poisson summation formula we obtain @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 extend over all the integers .",

    "we now return to the main objective of this section : determination of the phase diagram of the gauged height model @xmath114 in ( [ g7 ] ) .",
    "we will restrict our attention to @xmath0 ; results for other half - odd - integer values of @xmath9 are similar , and the generalization to integer @xmath9 is straightforward .    as in the work by fradkin and shenker @xcite , it is useful to look at various limiting values of the couplings in @xmath114 : from these results we have constructed the phase diagram shown in fig  [ fig6 ] .",

    "by familiar arguments  @xcite it is expected that the universality class of the transition along this entire line will be the same as that of the @xmath153 , @xmath141 point , and the @xmath136 , @xmath138 point is a singular limit .",
    "we now discuss recent work@xcite which examined the consequences of hole - doping the state with broken translational symmetry in fig  [ fig6 ] . a theory for hole - doping the deconfined higgs phase of fig  [ fig6 ] does not exist and would be an interesting direction for future work .",
    "the study was carried out in a particular large @xmath1 limit in which the columnar spin - peierls state of fig  [ fig1]a was a ground state in mean - field theory .",
    "further , the ordering in the state was fully developed , and the ground state was well separated from any possible phase transition to a deconfined higgs phase or to a magnetically ordered state .",
    "this is probably not a realistic situation for the insulator , but it is expected that the results so obtained are generic for doping an arbitrary spin - peierls phase .",
    "the results of the study have also been reviewed recently@xcite , and so we will limit ourselves here to highlighting the main results and mentioning some experimental implications .    as in refs  @xcite , the main effect found was that for reasonable values of the microscopic parameters , the holes prefer to segregate in one - dimensional striped structures with a finite density per unit length  so as the net hole concentration tends to zero , the stripes move farther apart but maintain a finite hole density per unit length per stripe .",
    "however , the existence of a background of spin - peierls order makes the details of the hole configurations quite different from earlier work  @xcite in experimentally significant ways , as we detail below . a schematic for the evolution of the hole configuration",
    "is indicated in the phase diagram in fig  [ fig7 ] .",
    "is the symmetry of spin rotations and it is broken in the hatched region , while @xmath167 is the translational symmetry which broken in the shaded region . at zero doping ,",
    "the physical system has nel order and so @xmath168 is broken . by using some frustration in the spin hamiltonian ( or considering models with a larger spin symmetry group ( large @xmath1 ) ) , we move the system across the quantum critical point @xmath169 into state with columnar spin - peierls ( bond - charge - density ) order .",
    "the states obtained by doping this state are sketched : the thick and dashed lines indicate varying values of the bond charge density , while the circles represent site hole density .",
    "all the states with non - zero hole density are superconducting for large enough @xmath1 , but could undergo phase transitions to insulating , anisotropic wigner crystalline states as @xmath1 is reduced .",
    ", width=364 ]    the unit cells of the charge ordered states in fig  [ fig7 ] have size @xmath170 ; within each unit cell , the holes are concentrated in a region of size @xmath171 .",
    "both @xmath172 and @xmath173 were always found to be even , with @xmath173 remaining fixed while @xmath174 as the doping concentration @xmath175 .",
    "significant properties of these even - width stripes are :    * the holes density per unit length in the @xmath173-width region is not unity ( as found in earlier theories  @xcite ) but various continuously dependent upon microscopic parameters . for reasonable choices we can obtain a hole density per unit length of around 0.5 ( for @xmath176",
    "this corresponds to a ladder with @xmath177 hole per site ) , but it is never pinned at exactly this value for any finite range of doping , @xmath178 _ i.e. _ the stripes are not incompressible .",
    "* there are strong pairing correlations between the holes in each @xmath173-width region .",
    "this leads to an anisotropic superconducting ground state , and should allow good metallic conduction above the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with observations@xcite on @xmath179 . * the evolution of the charge ordering wavevector ( @xmath180 ) as a function of doping , @xmath178 , is shown in fig  [ fig8 ] .",
    "+ ) as a function of the doping , @xmath178 ( from ref  @xcite).,width=336 ] + note that this wavevector is always quantized at values which equal 1/(even integer ) .",
    "the plateaus are quite small for small @xmath178 , but become progressively broader as the even integer decreases .",
    "in particular , as is observed experimentally , a large plateau at wavevector 1/4 is present and this emerges naturally from our theory  we regard this as significant .",
    "plateaus at smaller wavevector ( say 1/6 ) have not been experimentally observed , but the resolution of current experiments is not precise enough to distinguish the staircase - like evolution in fig  [ fig8 ] from a continuous variation before reaching the plateau at 1/4 . the hole density per unit length of stripe varies continuously within each plateau but jumps discontinuously as the transition is made from one plateau to the next . *",
    "note that , in fig  [ fig8 ] , before reaching the d - wave superconducting state with @xmath181 , there is also a small plateau at @xmath182 : this is a state with uniform site - charge density , but with the bond - charge density of fig  [ fig1]a coexisting with d - wave - like superconductivity .",
    "such a state has not been observed , and it would be interesting to look for one . *",
    "all of the stripes found in this computations are bond - centered , at least in the region where the symmetry of spin - rotations , @xmath168 , remains unbroken ; we can not rule out the possibility that there will be a transition to site - centered stripes , like those found earlier  @xcite , once @xmath168 is broken .",
    "it would be useful for future experiments to detect this distinction between bond - centered and site - centered stripes .",
    "let us discuss this difference more precisely for the case @xmath183 .",
    "for the site - centered stripe , the hole density per unit length in each column of sites takes values @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath185 before repeating periodically ( where @xmath187 are some three distinct densities ) ; this is the configuration usually assumed in most experimental papers .",
    "in contrast for the bond - centered state , these densities take the values @xmath184 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath185 , and this also appears to be compatible with existing observations . in the computation here",
    "the bond - centering is important for enhancing pairing correlations , which are responsible for superconducting / metallic transport in the direction parallel to the stripes .",
    "we note that a very recent nqr experiment@xcite indicates a charge distribution which has some features consistent with the bond - centered state : they find only two inequivalent sites associated with the stripes , and a density per site in the hole - rich region which is only about 0.18 - 0.19 ( the fully segregated site - centered stripe would have @xmath188 , @xmath189 , while the fully segregated bond - centered stripe would have @xmath190 , @xmath191 ; clearly the bond - centered value is more compatible with observations ) .",
