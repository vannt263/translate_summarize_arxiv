    "various experiments at cern sps reported an enhancement of strange particle production when going from p - p , p - a to a - a collisions @xcite .",
    "in particular the recent analysis of pb - pb reaction by the wa97 collaboration has shown , by comparing p - be , p - pb with pb - pb , a strong enhancement in the pertinent strange and antistrange baryon yields @xcite .",
    "in addition this enhancement was found to increase with strangeness content of the particle .    in this letter",
    "we show that the observed features of the data can be well described by the thermal model for particle production using canonical formulation of strangeness conservation .",
    "the statistical models formulated in the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble , with respect to conservation laws , were shown to give a satisfactory description of particle production in heavy ion collisions at sps and ags energies @xcite . however ,",
    "when applying this model to the low energy heavy ion @xcite , or high energy hadron - hadron or @xmath2 reactions one necessarily needs to treat the conservation laws exactly @xcite .",
    "the exact conservation of quantum numbers , that is the canonical ( c ) approach , is known to reduce the phase space available for particle production due to additional constraints appearing through requirements of local quantum number conservation @xcite .",
    "thus , the immediate question is to what extend the canonical suppression can account for the observed effect in the wa97 experiment .",
    "the concept of canonical suppression as an origin of strangeness enhancement has been already addressed in the literature @xcite and also tested in the context of the sps data @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown @xcite that the increase of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ratios from p - p to a - a collisions can be possibly explained by the canonical effect . in view of the new data from the wa97 collaboration we will test further this idea and",
    "show that the suppression of strange particles phase space when going from gc to c formulation of strangeness conservation can quantitatively explain the reported data .    in the following section we present the main aspects of the statistical model formulated in canonical ensemble and then we compare the model with the experimental data .",
    "we consider a gas composed of all particles and resonances with mass up to @xmath5gev .",
    "conservation of baryon number is introduced in gc ensemble , thus it is controlled by baryochemical potential .",
    "strangeness conservation , however , is introduced on the canonical level .",
    "having in mind the application of the model to particle production in heavy ion collisions we also require that the overall strangeness of the system is zero . using the general procedure for the canonical strangeness conservation @xcite the partition function of a gas of particles with strangeness @xmath6",
    "can be written as follows :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and the sum is taken over all particles and resonances carrying strangeness @xmath9 . for particle of mass @xmath10 ,",
    "degeneracy factor @xmath11 , baryon number @xmath12 , and assuming boltzmann statistics we have :    @xmath13    with the particular form of the partition function given by eq.([eq1 ] ) the density @xmath14 of particle @xmath15 with strangeness @xmath9 in volume @xmath16 is obtained by the replacement @xmath17 in eq.([eq1 ] ) and then taking an appropriate derivative @xcite :    @xmath18\\}/z_0 \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and the partition function @xmath20.\\ ] ]    in the derivation of eq.([eq3 ] ) we have neglected , after differentiation over particle fugacity , the term @xmath21 .",
    "this approximation , however , due to small value of @xmath21 coefficients in comparison with @xmath22 is quite satisfactory .",
    "the complete expression for the partition function without any approximation can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "due to the locality of strangeness conservation , we have introduced two volume parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath23 in eq.([eq3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 describes the volume of the system at freeze out , thus @xmath16 is also the overall normalization factor which fixes the particle multiplicity from the corresponding density . the volume @xmath23 is interpreted as a correlation volume where particles are created to fulfill the requirement of local conservation of quantum numbers .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in the canonical description of particle production in low energy heavy ion collisions @xmath24 is required to reproduce both the particle multiplicity ratios and the particle yields .",
    "the volume parameter @xmath16 scales with the total number of participants , @xmath25 , whereas @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the number of the projectile participants .    comparing the result of eq.([eq3 ] ) with the standard expression for the particle density in gc ensemble",
    ", one can see that the term multiplying @xmath29 in eq.([eq3 ] ) plays the role of the strangeness fugacity   @xcite . indeed taking the limit for large @xmath30 , in eq.([eq3 ] ) , that is the limit of high temperature and/or large @xmath23 , the gc result for the particle density is recovered . in the opposite limit",
    "the c ensemble leads to a strong suppression of strange particle densities .    in fig.[ape ]",
    "we show the dependence of the density of strange particles on @xmath23 for fixed @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 mev . in order to illustrate the enhancement with increasing volume and strangeness content of the particle we show in fig.[ape ] the density of @xmath33 and @xmath34 baryons normalized to its value calculated in the volume @xmath35 @xmath36 , as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear from fig.[ape ] that the particle densities are increasing with the size of the system . for sufficiently large @xmath23",
    "the densities are saturating which indicates that the gc limit is reached .",
    "the enhancement is seen to increase with the strangeness content of the particle and obviously depends on the choice of @xmath38 . keeping the value of baryon chemical potential and/or temperature as being @xmath23 independent ,",
    "the enhancement of antibaryons is similar to the one seen in fig.[ape ] for baryons .",
    "thus , the possible asymmetry in enhancement for strange baryons and antibaryons when going from small to large system requires @xmath39 and/or @xmath40 to be @xmath23 dependent .    in the following section we will discuss to what",
    "extend the above model can be used to understand strangeness enhancement versus centrality for baryon and antibaryons reported by the wa97 collaboration .",
    "it is seen in fig.[ape ] that the model reproduce the main features of centrality dependence of strangeness enhancement in the wa97 data .",
    "the quantitative comparison of the model with the experimental data require , however , a particular choice of the parameters , that is : the temperature @xmath40 , the volume @xmath23 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath39 .",
    "we have used for pb - pb collisions : @xmath31 mev and @xmath41 mev , the values which have been shown @xcite to give a good description of all data on particle multiplicity ratios measured by the na49 and wa97 experiments .",
    "in general temperature and chemical potential could vary with @xmath23 that is also with @xmath28 . from previous analysis",
    "we know @xcite that for the same collision energy the temperature variations with @xmath42 is small .",
    "thus , we keep @xmath40 to be the same for both , p - be and pb - pb systems .",
    "the chemical potential , however , as discussed in the previous section , has to be taken as @xmath42 dependent since the data are showing larger enhancement for strange than for antistrange baryons .",
    "this indicates lower value of @xmath43 in p - be than in pb - pb system .",
    "we use @xmath44 in p - be as a free parameter which is chosen to reproduce the enhancement asymmetry between @xmath45 and @xmath46 or simply the @xmath47 ratio measured in p - be collisions .    following the interpretation of @xmath23 , described in the previous section",
    ", we chose @xmath48 fm in p - be that is @xmath49 . to make a quantitative comparison of the model with the experimental data we are left with only one parameter , the effective chemical potential @xmath44 in p - be which was taken to be 150 mev",
    "this value is required in comparison with @xmath41 mev in pb - pb in order to obtain the correct splitting between baryons and antibaryons of the enhancement factors without affecting the average enhancement factors .    in fig.[pen ]",
    "we show the densities calculated in c ensemble for large @xmath23 normalized to its value at @xmath50 in to p - be system .",
    "this corresponds to the experimental comparison of yield / participant of pb - pb to p - be system .",
    "the full lines in fig.[pen ] are calculated from eq.([eq3 ] ) by varying @xmath23 and keeping @xmath41 mev .",
    "the change of @xmath23 with centrality in pb - pb collisions is included relating @xmath26 with @xmath42 through , @xmath51 , which determines approximately the number of projectile participants .    the actual path from grand canonical to canonical result for the particle densities would required an additional knowledge of @xmath42 dependence of chemical potential which is effectively changing from 266 mev in pb - pb to 150 mev in p - be system .",
    "formulating , in addition to strangeness , also baryon number conservation canonically , the path from gc to c result as a function of @xmath23 can be established @xcite . in the simplified model , presented here , where baryon number conservation was introduced effectively trough chemical potential",
    "we can only study the relative enhancement of strange baryon densities from small p - be to large pb - pb system .",
    "the result presented in fig.[pen ] shows that the relative enhancement of strange baryon and antibaryon yield / participant from p - be to pb - pb , found experimentally , can be well described by the effect of canonical suppression and the change of @xmath39 from 266 mev in pb - pb to 150 mev in p - be collisions .",
    "the enhancement appears in the model to be almost saturated for @xmath52 which indicates that the system is close to its gc limit . the enhancement pattern for different strange baryons and antibaryons densities is also understood within the model as a consequence of different dependence on @xmath23 . in the large system like pb - pb , and for large collision energy required to maintain high @xmath40 , the density @xmath14 of particle carrying strangeness @xmath9 , is @xmath23 independent . in the opposite limit",
    ", however , this dependence is changed to @xmath53 which can be verified from eq.([eq3 ] ) . for small @xmath30",
    "we have approximately :    @xmath54    expanding the bessel functions @xmath55 in eq.([eq6 ] ) we see that @xmath56 .",
    "the variation of @xmath23 with the number of projectile participants and the assumption that @xmath24 is also justified by the data .",
    "indeed the recent data of the wa97 collaboration show that strange particle yield/@xmath42 is independent on @xmath42 in p - a collisions .",
    "this is well reproduced by canonical treatment since @xmath23 is the same for all a in p - a collisions .",
    "if one could , however , take @xmath57 then , since @xmath25 , a strong variation with @xmath42 of strange particle densities should be observed in p - a collisions when changing a. in addition this variation would depends on the strangeness content of the particle which is not experimentally observed in p - a .",
    "thus from the point of view of the considered canonical model , p - be and p - pb are the same system with the only difference being contained in slightly larger @xmath44 in p - pb then p - be .",
    "we found that the chemical potential in p - pb increases by about 10@xmath58 with respect to p - be .",
    "this explains similar excess of particle yield/@xmath42 in pb - pb relative to p - be and p - pb collisions .    until now we have assumed that p - a as well as pb - pb system can be described by the statistical model in chemical equilibrium . for pb - pb collisions",
    "chemical equilibrium assumption has been found to give a good agreement of the model with the experimental data @xcite . in p - a collisions , however , due to small time scale , deviations from strangeness chemical saturation can not be excluded . in a previous analysis @xcite of particle production in @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "collisions in terms of c ensemble strangeness under saturation was accounted for by introducing an additional parameter @xmath62 which measures deviation of strangeness from full equilibrium @xcite .",
    "also in this approach @xmath23 was assumed to coincide with @xmath16 . in the following",
    "we discuss how the possible out of chemical equilibrium together with the @xmath63 assumption will modify our results and conclusions .    to introduce non - equilibrium effects via @xmath62 parameter is quite straightforward @xcite .",
    "it amounts to the replacement @xmath64 in eq.([eq3 ] ) .",
    "first we observe that applying the limit @xmath65 in eq.([eq6 ] ) the density @xmath14 of particle with strangeness @xmath9 , scales as @xmath66 . for larger @xmath30 we found that , in the parameter range relevant for p - a system , this dependence is changed approximately to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , keeping @xmath68 , the value used in equilibrium model , we can as well reproduce the experimental data shown in fig.[pen ] in non - equilibrium formulation . in this approach , however , in order to reproduce experimentally observed linear dependence of strange particle yields with @xmath42 in p - a collisions @xcite , one needs , for each value of @xmath42 , to adjust @xmath62 such that @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , this requires a decreasing @xmath62 with @xmath42 . in general",
    ", one would rather expect the opposite behavior . in order to ovoid , however , the possible ambiguity with respect to strangeness undersaturation factor @xmath62 one needs to perform an additional detailed analysis in proton induced collisions for different targets and collision energies .",
    "this analysis could possibly settle to what extend there is a need for genuine global strangeness enhancement related with the change in @xmath62 between p - a and a - b collisions .",
    "we have used the comprehensive set of the recent results of the wa97 collaboration on the production of strange and multistrange hadrons in p - a and pb - pb collisions in order to check the validity of statistical model description of strangeness enhancement centrality dependence .",
    "the statistical model was verified to give a good agreement with all experimental data in a - a collisions at sps energies . from the point of view of statistical mechanics",
    "the application of the model for smaller system like p - a requires obvious modifications . in the large system strangeness",
    "is conserved on the average , thus it is controlled by strange chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble . in the small system , however , strangeness conservation laws must strictly be obeyed in each single collision which requires canonical ensemble .",
    "we have shown that the required passage from grand canonical to canonical ensemble reproduces the basic features of strangeness suppression from pb - pb to p - be or p - pb collisions reported by wa97 collaboration .",
    "the observed asymmetry in the enhancement of strange baryons and antibaryons requires additional assumption on @xmath42 dependence of baryon chemical potential @xmath39 .",
    "we have shown that with the particular choice of @xmath39 asymmetry in p - a and pb - pb systems the model provides good quantitative description of the data .",
    "deviation from chemical equilibrium has been included in our discussion only in p-  a system .",
    "recently an interesting non - equilibrium model for the description of particle production in a - b collisions has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of centrality dependence of strangeness enhancement in a consistent non - equilibrium picture would require additional analysis not presented in this paper .",
