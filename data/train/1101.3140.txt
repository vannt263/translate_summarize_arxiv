    "the numerical approximation can be of very bad quality , and the methods used to compute this approximation are converging slowly ( or not converging ) .",
    "the situation in practical problems , as encountered in cagd for instance , is even worse , since the coefficients of the input equations are known , with some incertitude .",
    "computing multiple roots of approximate polynomial systems seems to be an ill - posed problem , since changing slightly the coefficients may transform a multiple root into a cluster of simple roots ( or even make it disappear ) .    to tackle this difficult problem",
    ", we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we try to find a ( small ) perturbation of the input system such that the root we compute is an exact multiple root of this perturbed system . in this way",

    ", the support of the basis elements is revealed by this approximate process .    in the deflation step ( b ) ,",
    "new equations and new variables are introduced in order to arrive to a new polynomial system where the singularity is obviated .",
    "the new variables correspond to perturbations of the initial equations along specific polynomials , which form a dual counterpart to the basis of the dual space .",
    "one of the deflated systems that we compute from the dual system is a square @xmath27 system with a simple root .",
    "this improves the deflation techniques described in @xcite , which require additional variables and possibly several deflation steps .",
