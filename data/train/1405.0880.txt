    "compact galaxy groups at low redshift are ideal laboratories for studying the effects of extreme galaxy interactions , which are believed to be very important in driving galaxy evolution at high redshift .",
    "one of the best examples is the stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) , a strongly interacting compact group of six galaxies ( see fig . [ pointings ] ) that has been the subject of many studies since it was discovered in 1877 by m.e .",
    "stephan . it is an ideal candidate for detailed analysis , as it is bright and is in a rare but important stage of dynamical evolution that allows us to observe manifestations of both past and present interaction events .",
    "the sq includes a core of three galaxies ( ngc7317 , ngc7318a and ngc7319 ) with essentially zero velocity dispersion that have previously undergone several episodes of interactions .",
    "these past events are probably due to the dynamical harassment of a fourth galaxy with accordant redshift , ngc7320c , called the `` old intruder '' in the dynamical scenario described by @xcite . both ngc7317 and ngc7318a are ellipticals , while ngc7319 and ngc7320c ( which is not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) show spiral morphology but have lost almost all their interstellar medium ( ism ) along successive processes of interaction within the group @xcite .",
    "now the gas - rich spiral ngc7318b , the `` new intruder '' , is apparently entering the group for the first time at high velocity ( @xmath21000 km s@xmath1 ) , colliding with the intergalactic medium of the group @xcite .",
    "the sixth object , ngc7320 , presents a highly discordant redshift @xcite and is known to be a foreground dwarf spiral galaxy .",
    "many prominent elements of the sq morphology are consequence of the interaction history of the group , like the unrelaxed stellar halo comprising 30% of the optical light or the two tidal tails of different ages pointing to the old intruder ngc7320c @xcite .",
    "but the most striking feature of the group is the galaxy - scale shock generated by the ongoing collision between ngc7318b and the intra - group gas , which is the tidally stripped ism from ngc7319 and ngc7320c during previous interactions . along the last decade",
    "this shock ridge has been detected and studied in a wide range of wavelengths : from x - ray to radio through its synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "excitation diagnostics from optical @xcite and mid - ir @xcite emission lines also confirm the presence of shocked gas , and spitzer mid - ir observations reveal that the mid - ir spectrum in the shock structure is dominated by the rotational line emission of molecular hydrogen , h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas in this shock has revealed the presence of several kinematic components .    despite being the most studied compact group ,",
    "there are many questions about the quintet that remain unsolved .",
    "relatively few spectroscopic studies have been carried out , some of them dealing with the general properties of the group as its dynamical state and others focusing on particular aspects , but there is still much lacking information about the complex phenomena that define the past and future of these galaxies .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) may imply a significant step further in this field , as it allows a complete mapping of the physical properties of the relevant regions of the group .",
    "hitherto only has presented ifs observations of the sq , but they focused specifically on the shock region between ngc7318b and the debris field . in this paper",
    "we present for the first time 2d spectroscopic observations with a wide field of view that completely include five of the six galaxies related to the sq , as well as some of the intergalactic regions .",
    "this provides a powerful way of studying with spatial resolution the physical characteristics of the ionized gas both in the galaxies and in the intra - group material generated by the interactions .",
    "based on a proven methodology which includes the use of complete maps of pure emission - line intensities , the anaylysis on extracted stacked spectra from specific regions of interest , and comparison with theoretical model predictions , we confirm and extend previous results about the nature of the outflows in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc7319 , the properties of the shock region associated with ngc7318b , the discovery of current star formation in ngc7317 , and as a by - product , the internal structure of the foreground galaxy ngc7320 .",
    "this work is focused on the gas component of the sq , but these observations also provide very interesting information about the stellar populations , whose study will be performed elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[observations ] we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "sec.[discussion ] presents the analysis performed on the ifs data and the main results obtained .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in sec.[conclusions ] .",
    "the sq observations are part of the ppak ifs nearby galaxy survey ( pings , @xcite ) , a project designed to construct 2d spectroscopic mosaics of a representative sample of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "pings observations were carried out at the 3.5 m telescope of the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) at calar alto with the postdam multi aperture spectrograph ( pmas ; @xcite ) in the ppak mode @xcite , i.e. a retrofitted bare fibre bundle ifu which expands the fov of pmas to a hexagonal area with a footprint of 74x65 arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "the ppak unit contains 331 densely packed optical fibres to sample an astronomical object at 2.7 arcsec per fibre , with a filling factor of 65% due to gaps in between the fibres .",
    "the sky background is sampled by 36 additional fibres distributed in six mini - ifu bundles of six fibres each .",
    "additionally , 15 fibres can be illuminated directly by internal lamps to calibrate the instrument . during the observations",
    "the v300 grating was used , covering a wavelength between 3700 and 7100   with a resolution of 10   fwhm , corresponding to 600 km s@xmath1 for [ ]  @xmath55007 and 460 km s@xmath1 for h@xmath6 .",
    "the exposure times per field for pings non - dithered frames , including also the sq observations , were 3 x 600 s. more details about pings observations are available in @xcite . in the case of stephan s quintet ,",
    "four individual pointings were observed on the photometric night of 2008 august 10 , three of which were centred at the bright bulges of ngc7317 , ngc7319 and ngc7320 , while the last pointing was centred to cover ngc7318a and ngc7318b .",
    "the seeing was always smaller than 1.3 arcsec , never comparable to the fibre size .",
    "the fov of the ppak instrument is shown in fig .",
    "[ pointings ] as hexagons overlaid on the hst image , labelled according to the galaxy or galaxies they cover .",
    "the whole data set comprises 1324 fibre spectra .",
    "the pre - reduction processing was performed using standard iraf packages , while the main reduction was performed using the r3d software for fibre - fed and ifs data @xcite in combination with the e3d visualization software @xcite .",
    "after that , the fibre - based ifs data was spatially resampled to a datacube with a regular grid of 2 arcsec / spaxel , adopting a flux - conserving , natural - neighbour , non - linear interpolation , following the scheme described in , developed for the califa survey .",
    "astrometric corrections were applied to the final data cube , and foreground objects ( stars ) were eliminated from the fov of the pointings .",
    "then , following the procedure outlined in @xcite and @xcite , the fit3d software was used to fit the underlying stellar population of each spaxel spectrum by a linear combination of single stellar population ( ssp ) templates from the miles library @xcite covering a wide range of ages ( 0.09 , 1.00 and 17.78 gyr ) and metallicities ( z @xmath7 ) . once the stellar continuum is subtracted , a pure - emission spectrum is obtained .",
    "based on this residual spectrum , the intensity of the emission lines is calculated in each spaxel by fitting one or multiple gaussian profiles to the most prominent emission lines in the considered wavelength range , including : h@xmath6 , h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , [ ]  @xmath53727 , [ ]  @xmath104959,5007 , [ ]  @xmath106548,6583 and [ ]  @xmath106717,6731 , and also for the most prominent sky residuals present in the spectrum , i.e. [ ]  @xmath55577 , and  @xmath55893 lines ( see @xcite , for more details ) .",
    "the measurement of the line intensities for every spaxel provides images of the spatial distribution of all the strong emission line species included in the wide wavelength range of our observations .",
    "we applied a flux threshold in order to avoid regions dominated by low s / n data . for this purpose",
    ", we produced masks considering two criteria .",
    "firstly , we empirically determined for each pointing the value of the h@xmath6 flux below which the spaxels are clearly not associated with the galactic structure and can be associated with the background , and eliminated these spaxels .",
    "we did the same for the h@xmath8 map .",
    "secondly , we discarded those regions that were not consistent with the expected theoretical value of the h@xmath6/h@xmath8 ratio ( 2.87 following @xcite , within the systematic errors in the measurement of balmer lines ) . with this masking process",
    "we reproduced the galactic structure as seen in the hst image ( see fig.[pointings ] ) and we made sure that we were considering regions that are physically meaningful .",
    "this procedure was applied to all the pointings except ngc7317 , which showed no gas emission except for a region outside the galaxy that will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ discussion7317 ] . for the other three pointings we used the masked images of the emission lines to represent maps of key line ratios sensitive to ionization state , focusing on ratios of lines that are close enough in wavelength not to be strongly affected by dust attenuation .",
    "the species which are presented as the ratio with respect to h@xmath6 were masked with the corresponding h@xmath6 mask , while species presented as the ratio with respect to h@xmath8 were masked with the corresponding h@xmath8 mask .",
    "some examples of the final maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ maps ] , together with v - band contours of the corresponding galaxy or galaxies obtained with pingsoft @xcite after applying a v filter to the data , for comparison between the shape of the galaxy in the continuum light and the gas distribution .",
    "the maps show the galactic structures and highlight a wide range of phenomena according to each context , like the agn with shock emission in ngc7319 , the shock front in ngc7318a / b or the  regions distribution in ngc7320 , that will be further discussed in the following sections .",
    "the av extinction maps of ngc7318 and ngc7319 , included in fig .",
    "[ extinctionfigure ] , are derived from the balmer decrement of each spaxel spectrum , according to the reddening function of @xcite , assuming @xmath11 .",
    "theoretical value for the intrinsic line ratio h@xmath6/h@xmath8 was taken from @xcite , assuming case b recombination ( optically thick in all the lyman lines ) , an electron density of @xmath12=100 @xmath13 and an electron temperature @xmath14=10@xmath15k . in the case of ngc7319",
    ", we detect an extinction of @xmath16 mag in the nucleus and in the major part of the galaxy , consistent with dust produced by intense star formation in these regions .",
    "we notice that the higher extinction is found at the edges of the emission region , probably tracing dust accumulated by the gas expansion , although we should take into account that the extinction calculated in those regions may be conditioned both by the weak h@xmath8 emission and the limitations in the fitting of the stellar population models that might not correctly reproduce the h@xmath8 profiles in absorption . in the case of ngc7318 extinction map , we find a relatively low extinction with average values between @xmath17 mag , in a very inhomogeneous distribution , consistent with the mixing and turbulence expected in the shocked region .          this galaxy has played a main role in all the interaction episodes within the group , losing most of its gas as a consequence .",
    "these interactions may be responsible for the activity of its nucleus , classified as seyfert 2 . a powerful way to probe the nature of the dominant ionizing source in galaxies are the emission - line diagnostic diagrams ( introduced by @xcite ; hereafter bpt ) .",
    "they work by exploring the location of certain line ratios , involving several strong emission lines with a dependence on the ionization degree and , to a lesser extent , on temperature or abundance . through the application of different classification criteria @xcite diagnostic diagrams",
    "allow the separation of galaxies into those dominated by ongoing star formation and the ones dominated by non - stellar processes , and with sufficient information can further split the latter into seyfert agn and liners .",
    "some of the diagrams also contain a transition region , where the classification method indicates a blend of star formation and agn activity .",
    "the spatial resolution of the line emission maps obtained from the ifs observations of the sq has allowed us to elaborate diagnostic diagrams with the particular positions of every spaxel , instead of studying the integrated emission of each galaxy as a whole .",
    "the classification of each spaxel according to its position in the diagnostic diagrams provides information to study the distribution of the different ionizing sources across the galaxy . in the case of ngc7319 ,",
    "the diagnostic diagrams highlight the coexistence of several processes , like the agn emission from the ngc7319 nucleus and the shocked gas emission as a consequence of the outflow from the nucleus ( see fig.[7319bpts ] ) .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the nuclear region was extracted using pingsoft , by co - adding the spectra of the spaxels corresponding to that zone in the data cube . in order to obtain the pure - emission spectrum we applied the fit3d software to the extracted spectrum , to fit and subtract the underlying stellar continuum , as explained in sec .",

    "[ 7319total ] , confirms the classification of this galaxy as seyfert 2 .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , a96 ) reported the presence of a high - velocity outflow , that was later the objective of a first attempt of study with ifs techniques by @xcite and @xcite . using long - slit optical spectroscopic observations , a96 found that the gas in the south - west region relative to the nucleus is blueshifted from the systemic velocity by 300 km s@xmath1 in average , and 500 km s@xmath1 at maximum . after discarding galactic rotation and tidal effects as possible causes , it was finally concluded that this blueshift is generated by an outflow that may have a red counterpart in the north - east region , although this could not be observed with their data .",
    "the ppak v300 pings observations spectral resolution ( see sec.[observations ] ) does not allow to study the average velocity variations described by a96 .",
    "this is not a surprising fact , as the observations were not intended to perform a kinematic analysis , but to cover a wide range in wavelength .",
    "nevertheless we do detect some spaxels with blueshifted values of the order of 500 km s@xmath1 in h@xmath6 , located in a region of @xmath18 in the south - west at about 5  from the nucleus that is signaled with a red box in fig .",

    "this is in very good agreement with the maximum blueshift reported by a96 .",
    "observations with higher spectral resolution would be necessary to construct a complete radial velocity map and to study the possible presence of a red outflow located north - east from the nucleus .",
    "comparison with observations in other wavelength ranges would also be advisable .",

    "however , the outflow effects that we are not able to fully detect in the velocity field are instead much more visible in the study of the measured emission - line ratios .",

    "are supersonic with respect to the gas upstream and subsonic relative to the gas behind , shock waves can not travel ahead of the shock , but the shock may be preceded by a radiative precursor , affecting the pre - shock gas . in high velocity shocks ( v@xmath19 @xmath20 50 km s@xmath1 ) , this effect will lead to photoionization . the recombination photons , i.e. extreme uv and soft x - ray photons which are generated by the cooling of hot gas behind the shock front , may travel upstream and pre - ionize the pre - shock gas .",
    "the emission spectrum of radiative shocks depends upon the shock velocity and the physical conditions in the pre - shock material . the observed line intensities and widths in the outflow of ngc7319",
    "are consistent with the spectra of radiative shocks with velocity v@xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 km s@xmath1 .",
    "typically , the shock velocity ( v@xmath19 ) can be diagnosed using h@xmath6 , [ ]  @xmath56300 , [ ]  @xmath53727 and [ ]  @xmath55007 based on the emission - line velocity dispersion @xmath22 and/or the fwhm .",
    "nevertheless , as it was previously discussed , we do not have enough spectral resolution to determine the velocity dispersion of the gas or to resolve any line splitting in the data .",
    "therefore , since the scenario proposed by a96 seems consistent with our observations , we use the velocity range obtained by a96 ( 300 - 500 km s@xmath1 ) as a first approach to the shock velocity in order to estimate the parameters of the theoretical models that will be compared with our data .",
    "another important physical quantity that has an effect on the final emission spectrum of radiative shocks is the density of the pre - shock material .",
    "the average electron density may be measured from the ratio of excitation lines such as [ ]  @xmath106717/6731 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ] emission arises downstream , in the relaxation layer where the temperature is @xmath23k , so the [ ] derived average electron density ( @xmath24 ) would correspond to these regions . in the fast shock limit",
    "there is a density jump by a factor of 4 between the pre - shock material and the region immediately behind the thin shock front , i.e @xmath25 , and in the post - shock region ( with @xmath26 and @xmath27 k ) , the gas cooling is approximately isobaric @xcite . therefore we can calculate an approximation of the pre - shock density assuming isobaric conditions downstream the shock front ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , considering @xmath29 k which is typical of [ ] emission , and using the observed @xmath30 derived from the measurement of the [ ]  @xmath106717/6731 ratio in the shock region , the preliminary velocity range of 300 - 500 km s@xmath1 from a96 , and      which is the temperature immediately behind the shock front for a fully ionized gas ( assuming an ideal gas and 0.1 helium fraction , @xcite ) through this procedure we derive for our velocities range a pre - shock density range of @xmath32 @xmath13 .",
    "we have overplotted on the diagnostic diagrams the predictions from the fast - shock models with precursor photoionization of @xcite .",
    "shock models are generated using solar metallicity and a pre - shock density of 1 @xmath13 , in agreement with the density value derived above , and are represented for a range of shock - velocities ( v@xmath19 ) and magnetic field strengths ( b ) .",
    "similarly we have also overplotted on the diagnostic diagrams the predictions from the dust - free agn models of @xcite .",
    "agn models are generated using metallicity double than solar , as most of the narrow - line regions in seyfert galaxies are characterized by supersolar metallicity , with a mean value of @xmath33 @xcite , and an electronic density value of 100 @xmath13 , similar to the one derived from the [ ]  @xmath106717/6731 ratio in the nucleus .",

    "both shock and agn models were obtained using itera ( idl tool for emission - line ratio analysis ; @xcite ) .",
    "regarding shock theoretical predictions , the shock plus precursor models follow the track of the spaxels with an excellent agreement for the velocity range of @xmath34 km s@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed line ratios are inconsistent with the models that do not include the effect of the precursor .",
    "two of these diagrams , along with the theoretical shock models , are presented in the top panels of fig . [ 7319bpts ] .",
    "the wide range of shock velocities detected may indicate the presence of several kinematic components , but this fact could not be discarded nor confirmed with our data , which were not intended to perform a kinematic study of the system .",

    "u _ from the [ ] /[]ratio for several regions of the galaxy , following @xcite and obtaining a range of log  @xmath35 values between -2.7 and -3.4 . taking these results into account , we observe that dust - free agn models fit the spaxels positions with better agreement than dusty agn models .",
    "two of the diagrams , with agn models overplotted , are presented in the bottom panels of fig . [ 7319bpts ] .",
    "the observed line ratios are thus consistent both with shock and agn models , but neither of these possibilities can explain the observational results exclusively .",
    "even the nucleus emission , classified as seyfert 2 , is not plainly consistent with agn models , which may be caused by a partial contamination by shock emission that we observe projected on the nucleus .",
    "we reach the conclusion that the excitation mechanism of the gas in the galaxy is a mixture of agn photoionization and shocks , and the resulting emission spectra are generated by the combination of both ionization mechanisms . thus , while a96 scenario considered the agn photoionization as the only responsible mechanism for exciting the gas , the spatial resolution and wide fov of our data have allowed to detect the presence of shocks as another source of ionization , and to study the coexistence of these two processes in the observed gas emission of the galaxy .",
