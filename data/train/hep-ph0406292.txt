    ", the first suffix refers to the @xmath32 beam , which is unpolarised , the second refers to the target proton , the third refers to the @xmath16 and the fourth refers to the @xmath15 .",
    "further measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are redundant .",
    "paschke and quinn [ 9 ] show that @xmath35 , although both sets of data can be included in the analysis , to improve statistics .",
    "also @xmath36 ; the latter is much better determined than @xmath37 .",
    "there is then a chance of determining the six amplitudes up to an overall unmeasurable phase . in principle",
    "eleven sets of data are sufficient providing they explore all amplitudes in an ideal way . in practice",
    ", it turns out that the determination is almost unique at 1637 mev / c , the only momentum where polarised target data are available .",
    "there are some minor reservations concerning relative branchings to @xmath38 and @xmath39 and between @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is necessary to apply a mild constraint to partial wave amplitudes for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in order to prevent them drifting to large values .",
    "it is also necessary to make the simplifying assumption that , away from 1637 mev / c , @xmath42 and @xmath43 amplitudes are related to @xmath44 by simple centrifugal barrier factors . in the limited mass range over",
    "which data are available , these are mild assumptions , which have little effect on the determination of other partial waves .",
    "the available mass range extends only 200 mev above the @xmath14 threshold .",
    "resonances typically have widths of 250 mev , so it is difficult to establish the presence of resonances from ps185 data alone .",
    "nonetheless , results can be compared with analyses of crystal barrel and ps172 data having the same quantum numbers . in those data ,",
    "a mass range of 500 mev is available . for @xmath9 , @xmath45 , there are seven sets of data from these two experiments for final states @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; in addition there is some information from the production procss @xmath53 . from those extensive data , many resonances are observed with securely determined parameters [ 10 ] .",
    "it is of interest to see if those resonances corresponds to structures observed in @xmath3 .",
    "that is quite likely , in the same way that @xmath54 resonances appear in both @xmath55 and @xmath56 channels .",
    "1(a ) shows integrated cross sections very close to threshold for @xmath3 .",
    "the curve shows the s - wave intensity deduced later from the partial wave analysis ; the remaining intensity comes from p - waves in this mass range .",
    "[ ht ]    the cross section for the inverse process @xmath57 may be derived using detailed balance : @xmath58 here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are momenta of @xmath59 and @xmath15 in the centre of mass frame .",
    "1(b ) shows the resulting cross sections for @xmath57 .",
    "there is a cusp at threshold , first reported in ref .",
    "cusps are in principle well known , but are not often seen , so this case is interesting .",
    "the cusp is a feature of s - waves .",
    "the curve shows the fitted s - wave intensity ; in this mass range , the difference from data is purely due to p - waves .",
    "these p - waves are surprisingly strong near threshold , but are very well determined from polarisations and forward - backward asymmetries in differential cross sections ( fig . 2 below ) .",
    "the ps185 collaboration makes the reasonable conjecture that the s - wave is strongly absorbed into other open channels , whereas in this mass range p - waves are highly peripheral and therefore suffer little attenuation from annihilation . up to 6 mev",
    ", p - waves have momenta @xmath61 mev / c , and therefore a classical impact parameter @xmath62 fm .",
    "the curve follows the familiar @xmath63 law of thermal neutron physics .",
    "the @xmath63 dependence is verified in fig .",
    "1(c ) , where @xmath64 is plotted after subtracting off the contributions from p - waves .",
    "it will be useful to exhibit the origin of the cusp assuming there is an s - wave resonance , which will be fitted later to the data .",
    "the result is however quite general and is derived in the textbook of landau and lifshitz [ 12 ] . for an s - wave resonance ,",
    "the partial wave amplitude is @xmath65 where @xmath66 ; the term @xmath67 in the denominator @xmath68 will be discussed below . since @xmath69 and @xmath70 near threshold , @xmath71 the amplitude for @xmath14 elastic scattering is @xmath72 apart from a slow energy dependence from @xmath68 , the amplitude goes to a constant at threshold , namely the scattering length @xmath73 .",

    "( 3 ) is given [ 13 ] by @xmath81 where a subtraction is made on resonance .",
    "this formula will be used in fitting an s - wave resonance to the data .    for higher partial waves ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier makes cusp effects negligible .",

    "[ t ]       [ t ]                           elchikh and richard [ 8 ] show that six amplitudes are needed to describe @xmath3 .",
    "formulae for observables are readily adapted from the well known expressions for @xmath23 elastic scattering [ 14 ] .",
    "they have also been written down by paschke and quinn [ 9 ] .",
    "however , one needs to be aware that paschke and quinn quantise along the same axes for initial and final states .",
    "suppose the @xmath82-axis is taken normal to the scattering plane , @xmath83 along the beam direction and @xmath84 sideways in the plane of scattering .",
    "for spin transfer parameters , the expressions of paschke and quinn describe observables such as @xmath85 , with @xmath84 and @xmath83 in the _ same _ direction for initial and final states .",
    "the ps185 collaboration uses for the initial @xmath4 state the same axes @xmath86 .",
    "however , for the final state , they use axes @xmath87 , @xmath82 and @xmath88 with @xmath88 along the direction of the final @xmath16 .",
    "it is necessary to allow for the rotation of spins through the scattering angle @xmath89 between initial and final states .",
    "for triplet states , this involves a simple projection of spins as vectors from one set of axes to the other . for singlet states ,",
    "the rotation of axes has no effect .",
    "partial wave amplitudes need to include three standard factors : ( a ) the @xmath90 flux factor for the centre of mass momentum @xmath59 in the @xmath4 channel , ( b ) the relativistic phase space factor @xmath91 for the @xmath4 channel and the factor @xmath92 for @xmath93 , ( c ) blatt - weiskopf centrifugal barrier factors for both @xmath4 and @xmath14 channels [ 15 ] ; they give the required @xmath94 dependence near threshold on angular momentum @xmath95 and momentum @xmath60 is the @xmath93 channel .",
    "the product of these three factors will be written as @xmath96 .",
    "then partial wave amplitudes for spin @xmath97 , angular momemta @xmath98 and @xmath95 in intial and final states @xmath99 are written : @xmath100 where @xmath101 are analytic funcions .",
    "note that the factor @xmath96 must be factored out in order to avoid branch cuts below threshold .",
    "data at 1637 mev / c are adequate to give a unique set of partial waves . at other momenta",
    ", the analysis reveals quickly that the transition amplitude @xmath102 is well determined by the polarisations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the data are consistent with the same @xmath103-dependence for this amplitude as for @xmath44 , except for the centrifugal barrier factor for the d - wave . the radius of the centrifugal barrier optimises at @xmath104 fm . to simplify the analysis , the @xmath105 amplitude is parametrised with coupling constant @xmath106 and the @xmath102 transition amplitude is parametrised with coupling constant @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a complex constant .",
    "the separation between @xmath13 and @xmath1 initial states is sensitive only to polarised target data .",
    "therefore , the @xmath42 amplitude is parametrised with coupling constant @xmath109 , and it is necessary to assume that @xmath110 does not vary with @xmath103 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath43 amplitude which is fitted with coupling constant @xmath111 with @xmath112 constant .",
    "physically , the implication is that the branching ratio of @xmath14 does not change with mass .",
    "these assumption are of little consequence at low momenta because the @xmath113 centrifugal barrier suppresses the amplitude near threshold for initial d - states .",
    "partial waves for @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are treated in the same way .",
    "care is needed even at 1637 mev / c in handling the amplitude for @xmath117 . with present data ,",
    "the separation of the four @xmath114 amplitudes , abbreviated as @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , is the weakest link in the entire analysis .",
    "the @xmath121 amplitude is small and not a matter for concern .",
    "the @xmath119 amplitude is well determined by polarisations of @xmath15 and @xmath122 and differential cross sections .",
    "however , the @xmath120 amplitude shows some tendency to drift upwards in magnitude with only a small change in @xmath123 .",
    "the problem is cured by including into @xmath123 a weak penalty function which limits its magnitude .",
    "the penalty function adds to @xmath123 a term @xmath124 and the denominator @xmath125 is adjusted so that this term contributes 9 to @xmath123 .",
    "this technique allows @xmath126 to grow if the data really demands it , but constrains it from running away with little change in @xmath123 . below 1637",
    "mev / c , the fit is insensitive to this restriction , but above 1637 mev / c , there may be some sensitivity . further data from a polarised target at high momentum would solve this possible problem .    for @xmath127 and @xmath116 ,",
    "contributions from @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 are negligible because of centrifugal barriers in @xmath14 .",
    "both the inverse amplitudes @xmath132 and @xmath133 are definitely required .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath134 is also definitely required ; @xmath135 amplitudes are negligible .",
    ".changes in @xmath123 when individual partial waves are dropped from the fit and other amplitudes are re - optimised . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is a further feature which agrees with earlier observation of the @xmath115 resonance . in fig .",
    "11 , there is a highly significant @xmath136 intensity .",
    "the requirement for this amplitude arises from @xmath27 and @xmath28 data : dashed curves on fig .",
    "8 show the worse fit without this amplitude . in ref .",
    "[ 16 ] , a strong @xmath8 resonance was likewise observed at 2255 mev . in this mass range , both a @xmath7 and a @xmath8 resonance are expected in conventional quark models .",
    "so it is quite likely that two unresolved @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonance appear in both ps185 and crystal barrel data . in the crystal barrel analysis ,",
    "a second state coupling mostly to @xmath7 was reported at @xmath137 mev with @xmath138 mev .",
    "there is also a possible identification of the @xmath114 structure .",
    "there is a known @xmath139 [ 17 ] with a large width of 500 mev .",
    "if it is substituted into the fit , there is almost no change in @xmath123 and a small movement downwards of the @xmath114 resonance of table 3 to 2362 mev .",
    "it is possible that this resonance is to be identified with the @xmath140 of etkin et al . in @xmath141",
    "[ 18 ] ; its appearance in the @xmath14 channel would not be surprising .",
    "if the @xmath140 is substituted into the fit with the width reported by etkin et al , @xmath123 changes by @xmath142 .",
    "the peak in @xmath1 and @xmath13 at 2290 mev requires a strong phase variation .",
    "if the other peaks described above are identified with known resonances in crystal barrel data , it is inescapable that the @xmath143 peak is resonant .",
    "it would be a new resonance . in the crystal barrel analysis of @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath52 channels ,",
    "the @xmath143 amplitude was not well defined in this mass range .",
    "a resonance at this mass is a natural radial excitation of @xmath146 [ 17 ] and @xmath147 [ 16 ] .",
    "in earlier work , attempts have been made to fit these and @xmath4 elastic scattering data in terms of meson exchanges .",
    "there is no conflict between this approach and the apppearance of resonances .",
    "meson exchanges can act as part of the driving forces which generate resonances . when a resonance appears , the projection of the meson exchange into an individual partial wave acquires the resonance phase through re - scattering effects .",
    "a well known example of this is the nucleon exchange term which partially drives the formation of the @xmath148 .",
    "chew and low showed in 1956 how to include the nucleon exchange term in an effective range formula which includes the resonance [ 19 ] .",
    "a little information can be added concerning @xmath149 .",
    "data for the integrated cross section for this process were reported in ref . [ 4 ] close to threshold .",
    "it is of interest to use detailed balance as in section 2 to derive the cross section for the inverse process @xmath150 .",
    "does a cusp appear at threshold ?",
    "results are displayed in fig",
    "[ htb ]       errors are sizable , but there is no clear evidence for a cusp .",
    "the ps185 publication remarks that there is evidence for strong p - waves very close to threshold .",
    "they are reported to be even stronger than those in @xmath3 .",
    "it seems likely that they obscure the presence of a cusp .",
    "a fit is shown using a sum of s and p waves , but there is considerably flexibility in their relative contributions .",
    "further progress depends on more data",
    ". it would be valuable to have polarised target data at other momenta , particularly towards the top of the mass range , e.g. at 1990 mev / c . in principle , such a measurement is feasible at the new @xmath4 ring planned at gsi . with a frozen spin target ,",
    "such a measurement is technically straightforward . using a detector such as crystal barrel",
    ", it would also be possible to make valuable polarisation measurements for channels such as @xmath151 , @xmath144 and @xmath152 , allowing a definitive conclusion to the analysis of crystal barrel data .",
    "if a trigger could be included on @xmath153 decays and/or @xmath154 interactions in the detector , it would open up the possibility of studying final states such as @xmath56 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 over a wide mass range , and hence extending the important lass data , which run out around 2100 mev .",
    "a partial wave analysis has been presented of all published ps185 data . at 1637 mev / c ,",
    "the solution is unique , although care is needed to restrict the amplitude for @xmath117 so that it does not drift away to a large value .",
    "the analysis may be extended to cover all other momenta by making the assumption that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 amplitudes are related to @xmath44 simply by the centrifugal barrier for the initial state .",
    "the same assumption is employed for initial @xmath4 states @xmath38 and @xmath8 . below 1637 mev / c ,",
    "this assumption is not serious , since the centrifugal barriers for the initial state suppress these amplitudes strongly .",
    "there is direct evidence for a cusp at threshold in @xmath57 .",
    "this cusp needs to be included into the treatment of the @xmath1 partial waves .",
    "there is evidence for large phase variations in several partial waves in fig .",
    "if resonances are fitted to @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 partial waves , observed resonance parameters are remarkably close to resonances reported earlier in crystal barrel data . with that identification ,",
    "a new @xmath143 resonance is required at 2290 mev .",
    "also in @xmath40 , there is evidence for a resonance around 2360 mev which fits well as the @xmath140 reported by etkin et al .",
