    "the ever - growing bandwidth demand on internet and data networks has pushed the research in the field of optical communications towards more sophisticated transmission techniques  @xcite .",
    "this field has been characterized for decades by the simplest binary formats and transmission systems , since bandwidth requirements were met with both cost - effective and technological affordable solutions .",
    "nowadays optical communication channels have rapidly passed from 10 gbps to 100 gbps , whereas the next challenging step will lead to 1  tbps . among the more severe limitations involved in",
    "such a system upgrade , the technological and practical issues of processing high data rates on a single channel , and the optical channel impairments related to the required transmit power ( i.e. , the nonlinear effects ) are the most prominent . since a higher capacity will hardly be reached with single - channel transmissions , many different solutions and related implementation techniques have been devised and proposed , in order to exploit at best the optical channel capacity under current technological costraints .",
    "basically , all the proposed solutions , irrespectively of the particular transmission technique , are based on multi - carrier transmissions or so called superchannels@xcite , which means that the goal capacity is reached by binding up as many single - channels together as necessary , in an efficient way .",
    "the techniques investigated in this paper belong to this class and allow an effective and reduced - complexity packing of the channels aiming at greatly improving the spectral efficiency ( se ) of the transmission .    as in most digital communication systems ,",
    "orthogonal signaling is the paradigm traditionally employed also in the design of long - haul optical systems .",
    "this paradigm consists of ensuring the absence of intersymbol interference ( isi ) and , in multi - carrier scenarios , also the absence of inter - carrier interference ( ici ) , i.e. , the absence of interference between adjacent channels . as an example , in single - carrier coherent optical systems , possibly employing polarization multiplexing ( pm ) , given a conventional transmitter , with mach - zehnder ( mz ) modulators and return to zero ( rz ) or non - return to zero ( nrz ) shaping pulses , when group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) and polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) are effectively compensated for and nonlinear effects are limited , proper filtering and sampling at the receiver ensure that even a symbol - by - symbol detector enables an almost - optimal performance since isi and ici are very limited @xcite .",
    "examples of multi - carrier transmission systems based on this paradigm are represented by orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) and nyquist wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) @xcite ( and similar bandwidth narrowing techniques such as @xcite ) , where the use of proper shaping pulses allows to remove , at least in theory , both isi and ici without using guard bands and thus without wasting resources . on the other hand , when practical transmit or receive filters are considered and nonlinear effects come into play , orthogonality is no more guaranteed and an unwanted interference appears .",
    "in addition , in these orthogonal signaling systems , the spectral efficiency can be improved only by increasing the constellation cardinality , thus employing modulation formats that are more sensitive to nonlinear effects and crosstalk .    an alternative paradigm to increase the se",
    "is represented by time - frequency packing ( tfp ) @xcite . in this case ,",
    "low - order modulations , such as quaternary phase shift keying ( qpsk ) , are employed but the spacing between two adjacent pulses in the time domain ( i.e. , the symbol interval ) is reduced well below that corresponding to the nyquist rate . similarly , the frequency separation between two adjacent channels can be also reduced , with the aim of maximizing the _ achievable spectral efficiency _ , which is thus used as a performance measure instead of the minimum euclidean distance ( as in more classical _ faster - than - nyquist _ signaling schemes , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , rather than the optimal receiver , a complexity - constrained detector is considered . in other words , controlled isi and ici are introduced and partially coped with at the receiver either through a single - channel maximum a posteriori ( map ) symbol detector , which is designed to take into account only a limited amount of isi , or through a suboptimal multiuser detector ( mud ) , which enables the joint processing of multiple sub - channels and thus coping with a limited amount of ici ( and possibly isi ) .",
    "advanced signal processing plays a key role in tfp systems since , besides the fundamental working principles which entail decoding and soft detection techniques , significant performance improvements derive from a skillful combination of pulse shaping , coding , the adoption of a proper linear filtering ( the channel shortening technique described in @xcite ) , of a proper trellis - based map symbol detection strategy , and possibly of a proper multiuser processing .",
    "the aim is the maximization of the achievable se , computed by resorting to the simulation - based method described in @xcite which allows to also take nonlinear effects into account since it holds for * any * channel , including nonlinear and non - gaussian .",
    "with respect to @xcite , which considers the case of an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and a simple symbol - by - symbol detector after matched filtering , and * * @xcite which considers the optical channel in the linear regime and a more sophisticated receiver based on trellis processing , in this paper we have the following novel main contributions .",
    "( i ) first , we compute the spectral efficiency and optimize the system parameters _ by taking into account nonlinear effects_. ( ii ) then , the considered receiver structures are different .",
    "we consider a trellis - based receiver enhanced by the use of the channel shortening technique @xcite .",
    "this makes a big difference in terms of performance .",
    "we also consider here the case of use of a nonlinear compensation technique at the receiver based on digital backpropagation .",
    "( iii ) finally , we compare the performance of the tfp technique with other solutions in the literature .",
    "a similar investigation has been performed in @xcite with reference to the nonlinear satellite channel .",
    "satellite nonlinearities are , in nature , very different from those affecting long - haul optical transmissions .",
    "the results and the conclusions here reported are thus very different from those reported in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will see here that in long - haul optical links with strong nonlinear effects , an increase of se can not be simply obtained by increasing the modulation order .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is described in section [ sec : system - model ] .",
    "the framework that we use to evaluate the se is then described in section [ sec : spectral - efficiency - optimization ] , whereas the adopted receivers are described in section [ sec : auxiliary - channel - model ] .",
    "numerical results are reported in section [ sec : simulation - results ] with a detailed comparison with alternative approaches in the literature , possibly based on the paradigm of orthogonal signaling .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us first consider a multi - carrier system over an awgn channel , where @xmath0 equally - spaced adjacent carriers are associated to the same linear modulation format and shaping pulse @xmath1 .",
    "the complex envelope of the transmitted signal can be expressed as is the signal transmitted on one state of polarization . ]",
    "@xmath2    where @xmath3 is the number of symbols transmitted over each carrier , @xmath4 the symbol interval , @xmath5 the symbol transmitted over the @xmath6th carrier during the @xmath7th symbol interval , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the delay and the initial phase of the @xmath6th carrier , respectively , and @xmath10 the frequency spacing between two adjacent carriers .",
    "in such a scenario , the capacity - achieving distribution of the transmitted symbols is gaussian .",
    "hence , in order to maximize the system spectral efficiency , independent and uniformly distributed ( i.u.d . )",
    "gaussian symbols @xmath11 must be employed along with a shaping pulse @xmath1 having a rectangular spectrum ( sinc pulse ) with bandwidth @xmath12 and a frequency spacing @xmath13 , i.e. , no guard band is employed between two adjacent carriers .",
    "no isi or ici occur since orthogonal signaling is employed .",
    "practical systems necessarily deviate from this paradigm .",
    "first of all , the transmitted symbols @xmath11 are not gaussian but usually belong to a properly normalized zero - mean @xmath14-ary complex constellation @xmath15 . under these conditions , instead of trying to approach as close as possible the impractical condition of having a shaping pulse with rectangular spectrum and to reduce as much as possible the guard band , as in nyquist - wdm systems @xcite , tfp technique intentionally introduces both isi and ici to improve the spectral efficiency @xcite . in other words , for a given shaping pulse , the symbol time @xmath4 and the frequency spacing @xmath10 are properly optimized , as explained in section  [ sec : spectral - efficiency - optimization ] , to maximize the spectral efficiency by intentionally violating the orthogonal signaling paradigm .",
    "let us now consider a realistic optical system . in this case",
    ", the possibility to generate a transmitted signal with expression  ( [ eq : rec_signal ] ) is strictly related to the availability of a linear modulator . in other words , let us consider the transmitted signal associated to the carrier for @xmath16 . if the pulse @xmath1 has support larger than @xmath4 , this signal can not be directly generated through an mz modulator unless it is properly linearized .",
    "this is due to the nonlinear transfer function of the mz modulator between the electrical signal at its input and the optical signal at its output .",
    "we could , however , use an mz modulator to generate a linearly modulated signal with shaping pulse having support at most @xmath4 and then `` stretch '' the transmitted pulses through an optical filter , thus obtaining an effect similar to that obtained with time packing .",
    "hence , in this case , time - packing is not an available option but we have a viable surrogate .",
    "the degrees of freedom are thus the frequency spacing @xmath10 and the bandwidth @xmath17 of the optical filter used at the mz output  @xcite , which in the present analysis is always a 4th - order gaussian filter ( both at transmit and receive side ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : system - model ] shows a schematic of the considered transmission system , irrespectively of the constellation size .",
    "blocks related to the receiver will be explained in sections [ sec : auxiliary - channel - model ] and [ sec : simulation - results ] .",
    "we consider optical channels impaired by gvd and pmd , and in particular uncompensated links where chromatic dispersion compensation is only performed with a fixed - tap equalizer in the electrical domain at the receive side .",
    "we also take into account nonlinear effects , as it will be explained in section  [ sec : simulation - results ] , where a description of the simulated optical links will be provided .",
    "we will compare systems based on tfp and employing quaternary constellations with other known systems , based on higher - order modulations , which show good results in terms of spectral efficiency , namely nyquist - wdm systems @xcite and the receiver - side duobinary shaping in @xcite . in the latter system ,",
    "an electrical two - tap filter is used to force a duobinary shape to the received signal , thus limiting the ici , at the expense of employing a map sequence ( or symbol ) detector to cope with the introduced isi .",
    "this is , in practice , a heuristic version of frequency packing and the processing here described for tfp systems since it allows a larger packing in frequency at the transmitter .",
    "no comparison will be performed with ofdm systems since , from an implementation point of view , they present a few drawbacks for optical links and are also less efficient than the systems considered here  @xcite .",
    "we now describe the framework used to evaluate the performance limits of all optical transmission systems considered in this paper and to perform the optimization of the optical filter bandwidth and frequency spacing in case of adoption of the tfp technique .",
    "we are considering an optical channel with linear and nonlinear distortions , simulated through the split - step fourier method ( ssfm ) with proper complexity @xcite . denoting by @xmath18 a proper",
    "discrete - time received sequence used for detection of the information symbols @xmath19 , the information rate ( ir ) , i.e. , the average mutual information when the information symbols are independent and uniformly distributed ( i.u.d . ) random variables belonging to the given constellation , is defined as @xmath20\\label{e : ir-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes a probability density function ( pdf ) and @xmath22 a probability mass function ( pmf ) . in ( [ e : ir-1 ] ) , the information symbols are , as mentioned , i.u.d . and thus @xmath23 , for all @xmath24 .",
    "the spectral efficiency ( se ) is the ir per unit bandwidth and unit time and reads @xmath25\\ ] ] since @xmath26 is the time - frequency slot devoted to the transmission of symbol @xmath5 .",
    "the computation of ir and se requires the availability of the pdfs @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however , they are not known in closed form nor can we resort to the simulation method in @xcite to compute them .",
    "in fact , this method requires that the channel at hand is finite - state and the availability of an optimal detector for it @xcite .",
    "these conditions are clearly not satisfied in our scenario @xcite .",
    "we may thus resort to the computation of a proper lower bound on the ir ( and thus on the se ) obtained by substituting @xmath27 in ( [ e : ir-1 ] ) with an arbitrary auxiliary channel law @xmath29 with the same input and output alphabets as the original channel ( mismatched detection  @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting lower bound reads @xmath30.\\label{e : lb}\\ ] ] if the auxiliary channel law is representative of a finite - state channel , pdfs @xmath29 and @xmath31 can be computed , this time , by using the optimal map symbol detector for that auxiliary channel @xcite .",
    "this detector , that will be clearly suboptimal for the actual channel , will have at its input the sequence @xmath18 generated by simulation _ according to the actual channel model , _ and the expectation in _ _ ( [ e : lb ] ) is meant with respect to the input and output sequences generated accordingly @xcite .",
    "thus , no assumption on the real statistics of the discrete - time received sequence is required for the design of the adopted detector since it is designed for the auxiliary channel .",
    "similarly , the knowledge of the real statistics of the sequence @xmath18 are not required for its generation since it can be obtained by simulation through the ssfm .",
    "if we change the adopted receiver ( or , equivalently , if we change the auxiliary channel ) we obtain different lower bounds on the information rate but , in any case , these bounds are _ achievable _ by those receivers , according to mismatched detection  @xcite .",
    "we will thus say , with an abuse of terminology , that the computed lower bounds are the se values of the considered channel when those receivers are employed .",
    "all these considerations hold for any actual channel including nonlinear and non - gaussian ones .",
    "this technique thus allows to take into account receivers with reduced complexity .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to consider an auxiliary channel which is a simplified version of the actual channel in the sense that only a portion of the actual channel memory and/or a limited number of impairments are present .",
    "the considered receivers will be described in the next section .",
    "however , we may anticipate that for all of them we will assume that parallel independent detectors are employed , one for each carrier ( and each polarization in case of polarization multiplexing ) . in other words ,",
    "ici is not coped with at the receiver since multiuser detection is considered too computationally demanding .",
    "this corresponds to the adoption of an auxiliary channel model that can be factorized into the product @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a proper discrete - time received sequence used for detection of symbols @xmath34 transmitted over the @xmath6th carrier . under this hypothesis and assuming a system with a large number of carriers in order to neglect border effects , it simply results @xmath35 i.e. , the result can be computed by considering only one carrier and does not depend on the specific considered carrier . in a practical scenario with a finite number of carriers",
    ", we will consider the central carrier only , avoiding the computation on the border carriers which are affected by a lower amount of ici , thus obtaining a further lower bound . without loss of generality , we will assume that the central carrier is that with @xmath16 .",
    "note that , as stated , we are not able to compute the ir of the actual channel , but this is irrelevant because the optimal receiver for the actual optical channel is unavailable and thus we can in no way achieve it .",
    "the best we can do is to employ practical suboptimal receivers and for them we are indeed able to compute the relevant ir which will be called achievable ir .",
    "the corresponding achievable ( lower bound on ) se is thus @xmath36.\\label{e : eta}\\ ] ] the aim of the tfp technique is to find the values of @xmath10 and the bandwidth @xmath17 of the optical filter after the mz modulator providing , for each value of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or , equivalently , for each value of the transmitted power , the maximum value of se achievable by that particular receiver , which is optimal for the considered specific auxiliary channel .",
    "namely , we compute @xmath37 typically , the dependence on the snr value is not critical , in the sense that we can identify two or at most three snr regions for which the optimal spacings practically have the same value .    for fair comparisons in terms of se , we need a proper definition of the snr .",
    "we define the snr as the ratio @xmath38 between the signal power and the noise power ( in the considered bandwidth ) . under the assumption of a large number of carriers to avoid boundary effects",
    ", @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the power for each carrier , @xmath41 the overall bandwidth , and @xmath42 the two - sided power spectral density of the amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) noise per polarization , as if the channel were linear .",
    "@xmath40 is independent of the bandwidth @xmath17 .",
    "it is clearly @xmath43 . in the limit of a large number of carriers ,",
    "i.e. , when border effects can be neglected , or when @xmath17 is comparable with @xmath10 , we may approximate @xmath44 and thus @xmath45 the snr definition as given in ( [ e : snr2 ] ) is independent of the transmit waveform and its parameters .",
    "this definition will be adopted even when the number of carriers @xmath0 is rather small and , if we neglect the border effects , corresponds to the snr per carrier .",
    "this provides a common measure to compare the performance of different solutions in a fair manner and allows also to compare the se values obtained under nonlinear propagation conditions with the shannon limit for the bandlimited awgn channel .",
    "this will allow to appreciate the degradation due to the nonlinear effects .",
    "the system model described in section  [ sec : system - model ] is representative of the considered scenario and has been employed in the information - theoretic analysis and in the simulations results . in this section ,",
    "we describe two families of employed receivers and the corresponding auxiliary channels ( the channels for which those receivers represent the optimal map symbol detectors ) .    the first family is composed of receivers which completely neglect nonlinear distortions . hence , the corresponding auxiliary channels operate in the linear regime . as far as gvd and pmd",
    "are concerned , they are assumed perfectly compensated .",
    "as known , in the absence of nonlinear effects perfect compensation is possible through a proper two - dimensional equalizer  @xcite .",
    ", this equalizer is represented as the cascade of two fixed one - dimensional equalizers , one for each polarization , aimed at compensating for the gvd , and a short adaptive two - dimensional equalizer to cope with the pmd .",
    "] we also mentioned that multiuser detection is not considered at the receiver , i.e. , in the considered auxiliary channels ici is also neglected . under these assumptions ,",
    "the independent detectors mentioned in the previous section , one for each carrier and each polarization , have to take into account only ( a portion of ) the isi intentionally or accidentally introduced in the system . as an example , in the case of tfp or the adoption of the receiver - side duobinary shaping @xcite , the detector takes into account ( a portion of ) the isi intentionally introduced . in the case of nyquist - wdm systems , a receiver coping with the unwanted isi deriving from the adopted practical filters and shaping pulses is considered instead .    in the second family of auxiliary channels , part of the nonlinear effects",
    "are compensated through digital backpropagation @xcite .",
    "the remaining nonlinear effects _ _ ( such as signal - ase noise interaction that can not be compensated by digital backpropagation ) _ _ are neglected .",
    "then we proceed as in the previous case .",
    "so , in practice , after the possible digital backpropagation and the two - dimensional equalizer , the auxiliary channels are the same in both cases .",
    "the expression of @xmath46 ( remember that we are considering the central carrier only ) will be provided at the end of the section .    in practice",
    ", we are computing the se achievable on the optical channel when two possible receiver designs are adopted . in the first one ,",
    "nonlinear effects are neglected at the receiver ( i.e. , the receiver is designed for the linear regime ) .",
    "this is obviously a worst case .",
    "the second case is when we adopt the best available technique for the compensation of nonlinear effects . as shown in section [ sec : simulation - results ] , the presence or absence of digital backpropagation only affects the maximum values of achievable se but not significantly our conclusions .",
    "we expect that they will hold also when we employ other compensation techniques .    as mentioned , for the tfp technique the carrier spacing and the bandwidth of the transmit optical filter are optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency .",
    "for a fair comparison , in the case of nyquist - wdm systems we also optimize , from an se point of view , the transmit optical filter bandwidth and the channel spacing , with the constraint that the spacing is not smaller than the nyquist bandwidth , i.e. , @xmath47 ( otherwise we fall in the domain of the tfp technique ) . under these conditions the memory of the channel in the absence of nonlinear effects is usually limited to at most @xmath48 interfering symbols ( it can be simply verified by increasing the value of @xmath49 assumed at the receiver and noting that no improvement is attained ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the memory at the receiver in the case of the technique described in @xcite is , by definition , @xmath50 .",
    "the memory introduced by the tfp technique is , instead , potentially very large . to limit the receiver complexity with a limited performance degradation ,",
    "we apply a channel shortening ( cs ) technique  @xcite .",
    "in fact , when the memory of the channel is too large to be taken into account by a full complexity detector , an excellent performance can be achieved by properly filtering the received signal before adopting a reduced - state detector  @xcite .",
    "a very effective cs technique for general linear channels is described in  @xcite .    in the case of adoption of cs",
    ", we are looking for an auxiliary channel and the corresponding optimal map symbol detector .",
    "as mentioned , in the auxiliary channel model we consider that nonlinearities are absent or perfectly compensated whereas gvd and pmd are assumed perfectly compensated .",
    "in addition , independent receivers , one for each carrier and each polarization are considered here since , as mentioned , ici is neglected in the auxiliary channel model . hence , each receiver assumes that , apart from awgn , only one carrier is present .",
    "a set of sufficient statistics @xmath51 can thus be obtained by sampling the output of a filter matched to the transmit pulse ( matched filter , mf ) .",
    "the @xmath7th element of @xmath51 , under the above mentioned assumption that only the carrier with @xmath16 is present , reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 being the convolution of the shaping pulse @xmath1 after the mz modulator and the optical transmit filter impulse response , and @xmath55 a gaussian process with @xmath56 .",
    "vector @xmath51 can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a toeplitz matrix obtained from the sequence \\{@xmath59 } whereas @xmath60 is a vector collecting the colored noise samples .",
    "this is the so called _ ungerboeck observation model _ for isi channels  @xcite . according to the cs approach",
    ", the considered auxiliary channel is based on the following channel law  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes transpose conjugate , whereas @xmath63 and @xmath64 are toeplitz matrices obtained from proper sequences \\{@xmath65 } and \\{@xmath66 } , and are known as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "matrix @xmath63 represents a linear filtering of the sufficient statistics  ( @xmath69 ) , and @xmath64 is the isi to be set at the detector ( different from the actual isi )  @xcite . in  ( @xmath70 ) , the noise variance has been absorbed into the two matrices . in order to reduce the complexity , we constrain the target response used at the receiver to @xmath71 which implies that the memory of the detector is @xmath72 instead of the true memory @xmath49 of the channel .",

    "we would like to mention that on this link an experimental field trial demonstration has been also recently conducted , reaching a spectral efficiency of more than 5 b / s / hz despite the constraint to use ( poorly performing ) 1st - order gaussian filters , not flexible and penalizing frequency grids , neighboring data channels with commercial traffic , and no time available to perform the necessary system optimizations .",

    "this suggests that tfp with optimized packing can give values of the optical field intensity higher than those related to 16-qam .",

    "[ fig : se2 ] reports a comparison between the same systems as in fig .",
    "[ fig : se1 ] , but compensating nonlinear fiber impairments * * at the receive side with an ideal digital backpropagation technique @xcite , operating on the whole transmission bandwidth at full complexity , i.e. , the same complexity used to simulate the nonlinear channel through ssfm .",
    "this will allow to increase the optimal launch power and will allow higher order modulations to better exploit their potential .",
    "in other words , since the channel is now `` more linear '' , we expect that nyquist - wdm with higher order modulations outperform tfp .",
    "this can be verified fig .",
    "[ fig : se2 ] although tfp still outperforms 16-qam .",
    "we also computed the se of the same systems but by changing the number of sub - channels and their baud rates . in this case",
    "we compared the different modulation formats at equal baud rate , i.e. , 50 gbaud / s , and set the number of sub - channels in order to obtain approximately the same total bandwidth occupation .",
    "thus , by keeping the same filter bandwidths as in the previous case , we set 10 sub - channels for tfp - qpsk at 20 ghz frequency spacing , 4 sub - channels for 16-qam and 64-qam , respectively at 50 and 55 ghz spacings , and 3 sub - channels for 256-qam at 62.5 ghz spacing .",
    "results are very similar to those reported in case of equal bit rate and number of sub - channels ( and thus not shown for lack of space ) , confirming that the tfp - qpsk performance is independent of the granularity selected to reach the target data rate .    in order to verify the range of applicability of the considered techniques , in fig .",
    "[ fig : se3 ] we show the maximum spectral efficiency @xmath83 at the optimal launch power , as a function of distance on a simplified uncompensated link ( which means identical spans of length 100 km , amplifier noise figure equal to 5 db , no polarization mode dispersion ) , for all systems considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : se1 ] .",
    "tfp - qpsk is seen to reach the highest spectral efficiency in the range 1000 - 10000 km , i.e. , when link nonlinear effects significantly affect signal propagation .",
    "[ fig : se4 ] shows the same results but plotted as normalized se difference between the considered systems and nyquist - wdm 16-qam in @xcite , taken as a reference , i.e. , we defined @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the maximum value of se achievable by nyquist - wdm 16-qam in @xcite .",
    "it can be noticed that the se gain of each modulation format becomes constant after 2000 km , and tfp - qpsk is already the most efficient after less than 1000 km .",
    "[ fig : se5 ] shows similar results on @xmath104 as a function of distance for the systems used in fig .",
    "[ fig : se2 ] ( i.e. , in the case of adoption of ideal backpropagation ) .",
    "it can be noticed that , again , tfp - qpsk outperforms other systems at higher distances , whereas , obviously , in links where signal propagation occurs in the weak nonlinear regime , the higher information rate achieved by high - order qam systems prevails .    ]    ]    ]    ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : pulses ] shows the performance of tfp - qpsk and se - optimized 16-qam for different transmitted pulses , on a link corresponding to 10 spans of the scenario considered in figs .",
    "[ fig : se3]-[fig : se5 ] .",
    "in particular , in addition to the case of use of a @xmath105-order gaussian filter , we also considered the use of a @xmath106-order gaussian filter ( with optimized bandwidth ) and of root raised cosine ( rrc ) transmit pulses ( obtained through the use of proper filters ) with roll - off factor @xmath107 equal to 0.2 and 0.5 . in the case of rrc pulses , we optimized the frequency spacing @xmath10 and the symbol time @xmath4 ( related to the frequency support @xmath17 of each subcarrier by @xmath108 ) .",
    "results suggest that the pulse deriving from the adoption of a @xmath105-order gaussian filter performs almost as good as the rrc pulse with roll - off 0.2 , whereas a significant penalty is observed when using a @xmath106-order gaussian filter . nevertheless , in all cases tfp - qpsk performs better than 16-qam under this scenario .",
    "we compared different techniques to improve the spectral efficiency of long - haul optical systems . with the exception of short links where signal propagation occurs in the weak nonlinear regime ,",
    "the most promising solution is shown to be that based on time - frequency packing which is related to the use of narrow optical filtering and a tight packing of the carriers in frequency , giving up the signal orthogonality in the time and frequency domains , and on the adoption of detectors able to cope with the interference intentionally introduced in the system . when nonlinearities start dominating the performance , this solution provides better results than other solutions proposed in the literature and based on higher - order modulations , showing that , when nonlinear effects are present , the spectral efficiency can not be trivially increased by increasing the modulation order .",
    "this result is confirmed also for ultra - long - haul links , up to 10000 km , whereas better se values can be achieved using modulations with very high cardinality , such as 256-qam , but only for short range links where fiber nonlinearities have a weak effect , or resorting to compensation techniques such as digital backpropagation .",
    "we also reported simulation results on a modulation and coding format which , on a realistic optical link , reaches a spectral efficiency of 7.5 b / s / hz with a polarization - multiplexed time - frequency - packed qpsk , with a loss of less than 1 b / s / hz from the information - theoretic results .",
