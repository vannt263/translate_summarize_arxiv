    "unravelling the source for the late time accelerated expansion of the universe has become a central theme in modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "several candidates , responsible for this expansion , have been proposed in the literature , ranging from modified gravity theories to the introduction of cosmological models comprising of a negative pressure cosmic fluid , denoted as dark energy .",
    "the latter is parameterized by the equation of state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spatially homogeneous pressure and @xmath4 the dark energy density .",
    "a value of @xmath5 is required to ensure the cosmic accelerated expansion , and @xmath6 corresponds to the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "it is interesting that recent constraints from observational data have confirmed that the dark energy parameter lies slightly below the characteristic cosmological constant value , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "ameliorated fits to the data also indicate that an evolving equation of state parameter which crosses @xmath6 is mildly favored @xcite .",
    "the models satisfying @xmath7 are denoted as _ phantom energy _ models , and possess rather interesting characteristics , in particular , the prediction of the _ big rip _ singularity and the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "the latter is a fundamental ingredient of traversable wormholes , and it was recently shown that phantom energy may indeed support these exotic geometries @xcite .",
    "inspired by the evolving dark energy parameter crossing the phantom divide , we consider in this work a varying equation of state parameter dependent on the radial coordinate , i.e. , @xmath0 , and impose that phantom energy is concentrated in the neighborhood of the throat , in order to ensure the nec violation , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wormhole throat radius .",
    "the latter restriction may be relaxed far from the throat . despite the fact that the dark ( phantom ) energy equation of state represents a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid , due to gravitational instabilities",
    "inhomogeneities may arise . note that now one regards that the pressure in the equation of state @xmath10 is a negative radial pressure , and the tangential pressure @xmath11 is determined through the einstein field equations .",
    "this is fundamentally the analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors constructed a time - dependent solution describing a spherically symmetric wormhole in a cosmological setting with a ghost scalar field .",
    "it was shown that the radial pressure is negative everywhere and far from the wormhole throat equals the transverse pressure , showing that the ghost scalar field behaves essentially as dark energy . another interesting aspect of this topic is the effect of phantom energy accretion in wormholes immersed in this cosmic fluid .",
    "in fact , gonzlez - daz analyzed the evolution of wormhole and ringhole spacetimes embedded in a background accelerating universe  @xcite driven by dark energy , and further considered the accretion of dark and phantom energy onto morris - thorne wormholes  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this accretion gradually increases the wormhole throat which eventually overtakes the accelerated expansion of the universe and becomes infinite at a time in the future before the big rip .",
    "thus , the phantom wormhole models considered in this work may possibly arise from density fluctuations in the cosmological background @xcite . in this context",
    ", we shall also be interested in the analysis that these phantom wormholes be sustained by their own quantum fluctuations . as noted above",
    ", wormholes violate the nec , and consequently violate all of the other classical energy conditions .",
    "thus , it seems that these exotic spacetimes arise naturally in the quantum regime , as a large number of quantum systems have been shown to violate the energy conditions , such as the casimir effect .",
    "indeed , various wormhole solutions in semi - classical gravity have been considered in the literature .",
    "for instance , semi - classical wormholes were found in the framework of the frolov - zelnikov approximation for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "analytical approximations of the stress - energy tensor of quantized fields in static and spherically symmetric wormhole spacetimes were also explored in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , the first self - consistent wormhole solution coupled to a quantum scalar field was obtained in ref .",
    "the ground state of a massive scalar field with a non - conformal coupling on a short - throat flat - space wormhole background was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a zeta renormalization approach .",
    "the latter wormhole model , which was further used in the context of the casimir effect @xcite , was constructed by excising spherical regions from two identical copies of minkowski spacetime , and finally surgically grafting the boundaries ( a more realistic geometry was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context",
    ", this motivates the semi - classical analysis in this work , where the einstein field equation takes the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor operator of the quantized field .",
    "the formalism outlined in this work follows ref .",
    "@xcite very closely .",
    "now , the metric may be separated into a background component , @xmath16 and a perturbation @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the einstein tensor may also be separated into a part describing the curvature due to the background geometry and that due to the perturbation , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 may be considered a perturbation series in terms of @xmath17 . using the semi - classical einstein field equation , in the absence of matter fields ,",
    "one may define an effective stress - energy tensor for the quantum fluctuations as @xmath21 so that the equation governing quantum fluctuations behaves as a backreaction equation .",
    "the semi - classical procedure followed in this work relies heavily on the formalism outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the graviton one loop contribution to a classical energy in a traversable wormhole background was computed , through a variational approach with gaussian trial wave functionals @xcite .",
    "a zeta function regularization is used to deal with the divergences , and a renormalization procedure is introduced , where the finite one loop is considered as a self - consistent source for traversable wormholes . rather than",
    "reproduce the formalism , we shall refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details , when necessary . in this paper ,",
    "rather than integrate over the whole space as in ref.@xcite , we shall work with the energy densities , which provides a more general working hypothesis .",

    "[ sec : self ] , we analyze self - sustained traversable phantom wormholes in semi - classical gravity , considering that the equation governing quantum fluctuations behaves as a backreaction equation . finally , in section [ sec : conlusion ] , we conclude .",

    "the radial coordinate has a range that increases from a minimum value at @xmath9 , corresponding to the wormhole throat , to infinity .",
    "a fundamental property of a wormhole is that a flaring out condition of the throat , given by @xmath26 , is imposed @xcite , and at the throat @xmath27 , the condition @xmath28 is imposed to have wormhole solutions .",
    "another condition that needs to be satisfied is @xmath29 . for the wormhole to be traversable",

    "it is rather important to emphasize a shortcoming in the analysis carried in this paper , mainly due to the difficulties of the semi - classical theory of gravity and , in particular to the technical problems encountered .",
    "we have considered a semi - classical variational approach using the energy density , which imposes a local analysis to the problem .",
    "thus , we have restricted our attention to the behavior of the metric function @xmath25 , through a variational approach , at the wormhole throat , @xmath139 . despite",
    "the fact that the behavior is unknown far from the throat , due to the high curvature effects at or near @xmath139 , the analysis carried out in this work should extend to the immediate neighborhood of the wormhole throat .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that , in principle , phantom wormhole throats with a varying equation of state parameter dependent on the radial coordinate , may be self sustained by their quantum fluctuations within the semi - classical approach outlined in this paper .",
