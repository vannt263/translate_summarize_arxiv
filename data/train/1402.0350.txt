    "right from the discovery of newton s theory of gravitation , one question that has been haunting the human mind is ` how gravity works at cosmological distances ? '",
    "although there was no definite answer to this question , yet there was a feeling that the story at large distances is quite different to newton s gravitation .",
    "with the discovery of the cosmic acceleration in the late twentieth century , this feeling started transforming into belief .",
    "as a possible explanation for the cosmic acceleration , modifications to gravity at cosmological distances have recently received much attention .",
    "numerous modified gravity theories have been proposed during the last decade , some of which worth mentioning are , loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite , @xmath1 gravity @xcite , dgp braneworld model @xcite , galileon gravity @xcite , etc .    modification to gravity can be done keeping in mind that the deviations from general relativity ( gr ) can only be allowed at large distances . at close distances",
    "the theory should coincide with newton s theory of gravitation thus ensuring the consistency of the model with the solar system experiments .",
    "we know that the dgp brane model admits a self - accelerating solution ( cosmic acceleration in the absence of any matter in the universe ) @xcite .",
    "but unfortunately this solution is plagued with ghost instabilities , which renders the model rather invalid @xcite .",
    "there are many other modified gravity models suffering from this instability problem @xcite .",
    "of late an infrared modification of classical gravitation was proposed , as a generalization of the 4d effective theory in the dgp model @xcite .",
    "the theory considers a self - interaction term of the form @xmath2 in order to recover gr in high density regions .",
    "the most striking feature of the theory is that it is invariant under the galileon shift symmetry , @xmath3 , in the minkowski background . due to this invariance",
    "the equation of motion remains a second order differential equation , preventing the introduction of extra degrees of freedom , which are usually associated with instabilities .",
    "the study of gravitational collapse was started by oppenheimer and snyder in 1939 @xcite . in classical gr ,",
    "the gravitational collapse is a problem of great curiosity as we can get at least two types of singularities from it .",
    "one , covered by an event horizon , is coined as a black hole ( bh ) whereas the singularity alone is popular as naked singularity ( ns ) .",
    "now , one would always like to test the validity of cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) laid down by penrose , @xcite which stated that the end result of a collapse is bound to be a singularity covered by an event horizon , i.e. , bh .",
    "in last few decades there have been extensive research @xcite where the possibility of formation of ns has been investigated . to determine the end state of collapse ( ns or bh ) , the vaidya solution @xcite is utilized on many occasions .",
    "harko et al @xcite have also studied the gravitational collapse in vaidya space - time . +",
    "gravitational collapse has been extensively studied in modified gravity theory i.e. , in gauss - bonnet , @xmath1 gravity , lovelock theory etc @xcite .",
    "scheel @xcite demonstrated that openheimer - snyder collapse in brans - dicke theory results in bhs rather than nss with the positive values of brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 , they have speculated that the apparent horizon of a bh can pass outside the event horizon causing the decrease in the surface area over time .",
    "the values of @xmath4 forces the bh , to radiate its scalar mass to infinity soon after the initial collapse . in @xcite",
    "we get another relevant and interesting work regarding the gravitational collapse in the background of brans - dicke theory of gravity discussing the effects of different values of @xmath4 .",
    "rudra et al in @xcite has shown that lower the value of @xmath4 , greater is the chance of getting an ns . + in 1996",
    ", husain has studied the non - static spherically symmetric solutions of einstein equations , for a null fluid source , where the density @xmath5 and pressure @xmath6 of the fluid is related by barotropic equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "all of the new solutions supported the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "later the vaidya solution was generalized by wang et al @xcite .",
    "moreover the husain solution has been extensively used to study the formation of a black hole with short hair @xcite . the most recent development in husain solution",
    "was witnessed when the gravitational collapse of the husain solution in four and five dimensional space - times was studied by patil et al @xcite .    keeping all the previous works of gravitational collapse in gr/ different gravity theories in mind",
    "we feel it will be of a great interest if we investigate the existence of radial null geodesic from the collapsing body in the back ground of galileon gravity theory .",
    "the scalar factor present in the theory may help in collapse to form a ns more prominently than the gr does .",
    "as in @xcite we will check that whether the nature of the end state of collapse can be regulated by any parameter of galileon gravity . in this concern",
    "we must recall the fact that in @xcite while working with lovelock gravity , we saw that greater the deviation from einstein gravity greater was the tendency to have the ns .",
    "so in this paper , we are mainly studying the nature of singularities ( bh or ns ) formed by the gravitational collapse in galileon gravity and the conditions governing these .",
    "in section ( [ calculation ] ) , we present the brief overview of generalized vaidya solution in galileon gravity",
    ". we will first construct the einstein field equations in galileon theory for the vaidya metric and then with a proper choice of the structural dependence of the potential term upon the scalar field we will determine the @xmath8 , the mass term . in the next two sections we investigate the behaviour / existence of the outgoing radial null geodesic from the singularity taking the vaidya metric with the mass term @xmath8 derived in the last section .",
    "finally , the paper ends with some concluding remarks in section ( [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the galileon theory is described by the action @xcite : @xmath9\\ ] ] where where @xmath10 is the galileon field and the coupling @xmath11 has dimension of length , @xmath12 ,   @xmath13   and   @xmath14   is the matter lagrangian .",
    "here we consider the metric in spherically symmetric space - time in the form @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radial co - ordinate and @xmath17 is the null co - ordinate , @xmath18 gives the gravitational mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath16 and @xmath19 is the line element on a unit 2-sphere .",

    "we assume the matter fluid obeys the barotropic equation of state @xmath57    using equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we have the solution for @xmath54 as , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are arbitrary constants .",
    "since no solution for @xmath53 could be obtained due to the highly complicated nature of the field equations , we consider , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are arbitrary constants . now using the above values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the field equations we finally arrive at a differential equation in @xmath66 as ,",

    "we shall discuss the existence of ns in generalized vaidya space - time by studying radial null geodesics .",
    "in fact , we shall examine whether it is possible to have outgoing radial null geodesics which were terminated in the past at the central singularity @xmath74 .",
    "the nature of the singularity ( ns or bh ) can be characterized by the existence of radial null geodesics emerging from the singularity .",
    "the singularity is at least locally naked if there exist such geodesics and if no such geodesics exist it is a bh .",

    "this kind of singularity ( @xmath74 ) is known to be a central shell focusing singularity .",
    "the singularity is a ns if there are future directed non - space like curves in the space time with their past end points at the singularity . now if the outgoing radial null geodesics are to terminate in the past at the central singularity at @xmath74 at @xmath81 where @xmath82 , then along these geodesics we should have @xcite @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",

    "so we can recalled that @xmath88 corresponds to a central singularity .",
    "it can be seen easily that @xmath88 corresponds to a singularity of the above differential equation .",

    "we see that by proper fine tuning of the parameters it is always possible to have a uncensored singularity as the fate of the gravitational collapse in galileon gravity . we know from our previous works @xcite",
    "that a strong modified gravity like the brans - dicke gravity censors the singularity which is formed by the gravitational collapse .",
    "the role of eos parameter @xmath0 has been analyzed for different eras .",
    "when the eos parameter @xmath0 is @xmath154 , i.e. , stiff perfect fluid , we get positive solutions for higher values of @xmath63 , irrespective of the value of the @xmath4 in the range @xmath155 , which determines the possibility of ns . for radiation and dark energy eras ,",
    "the ns is the ultimate fate of the gravitational collapse . at phantom crossing ( @xmath135 )",
    ", we see that the tendency of getting a naked singularity increases as the value of @xmath4 is decreased . in phantom era ( @xmath148 ) , the tendency of occurrence of naked singularity decreases . in figures 1a to 1o",
    "we also see that the natures of @xmath159 contours for varying values of two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath63 . from the plots we get an idea that the possibility of ns increases for higher values of @xmath63 and the lower values of @xmath4 . from this",
    "we can conclude that the galileon gravity , which is an infrared modification of einstein gravity is perhaps not as strong a gravity theory as its counterparts .",
