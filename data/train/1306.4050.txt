    "since the initial discovery of evidence for cosmic acceleration ( @xcite , @xcite ) , there has been a concerted effort to discover increasingly larger samples of type ia supernovae ( snia ) and also to probe the systematic uncertainties in the current samples .",
    "snia measurements are still the optimal method to measure the equation of state of dark energy @xmath9 since sneia can be observed in a redshift range where dark energy is dominant and because of their high precision . in order to optimize the use of sneia as standard candles to determine distances , the majority of the snia light curve fitters ( e.g mlcs2k2 ; @xcite , salt2 ; , sifto ; @xcite , cmagic ; @xcite , snoopy ; @xcite , bayesn ; @xcite ) include two corrections to the observed peak magnitude of the sn : one using the width / slope of the light curve and the other using the color of the light curves .",
    "the width / slope correction for various light curve fitters all account in some manner for the  phillips relation \" @xcite , be it the spectral adaptive light - curve template method ( salt2 , sifto ) , the multicolor light - curve shape method ( mlcs2k2 ) , the color - magnitude intercept method ( cmagic ) , a bayesian hierarchical method ( bayesn ) or the @xmath10 method itself ( snoopy ) .",
    "a more fundamental difference between these fitters is how they interpret heterogeneous snia colors .",
    "some light curve fitters like salt2 or sifto find an empirical relation between color and luminosity , called @xmath1 in salt2 , while mlcs2k2 assumes that the color - luminosity relation follows the milky way reddening law .",
    "regardless of the approach , the corrections reduce the dispersion in distance to @xmath11 , which is assumed to be intrinsic but may result from unmodeled effects ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . to ensure that all cosmology fits have reasonable parameter errors ( @xmath12 ) , an intrinsic scatter of @xmath13 mag is added in quadrature to the distance modulus uncertainties .    historically , this irreducible scatter in the distance modulus residuals relative to a best fit cosmology , also called ` hubble residual scatter ' , has been attributed to random , achromatic variations in the luminosity .",
    "this ` luminosity variation ' is the variation in snia brightness that does not correlate with distance and is independent of the light curve corrections . while it is relatively simple to apply the assumption that hubble residual scatter is due to luminosity variation , there is little , if any , direct evidence to support this claim .",
    "variations of color and shape in the sn light curves , which do not correlate with distance in the way expected by light curve fitters , present equally plausible alternatives .",
    "we denote color variation as the variation in colors for a fixed distance , which can be observed as the variation in distances at a fixed color .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m11 ) presents a mathematical formalism for assigning this  intrinsic scatter \" of snia to either the luminosity , color or stretch variation or a combination of the three . here",
    ", we call this scatter the ` residual scatter ' , or @xmath14 , as it is needed to explain the scatter in the hubble residuals . @xcite ( hereafter k13 ) explores various sources of this residual scatter and shows that misidentifying the source of scatter biases the recovery of @xmath1 by up to @xmath15 and @xmath4 up to @xmath16 when assuming a broad , fixed color distribution .",
    "we revisit this assumption here .",
    "there is evidence to suggest that color variation is non - negligible . @xcite and @xcite both examine the relations between silicon and calcium features of snia spectra and snia color and conclude there must be color variation on the order of what is needed to explain the hubble residual scatter .",
    "@xcite analyzed @xmath17 day nebular colors @xcite , a phase when light curve shape dependent color variation is minimized , and found there must be a similarly high amount of color variation .",
    "there is also preliminary evidence that color variation may partly account for the trends between hubble residuals and host galaxy properties @xcite .    in this paper , we use publicly available data from sdss @xcite , snls3 and nearby samples ( see @xcite for a review ) and the snana simulator @xcite and explore how misattribution of the source of residual scatter and ignorance of the underlying color distribution affect @xmath1 and @xmath4 estimation . in  [ sec : lcfits ] we present an analysis of the different components of the observed color and explain how the bias in the sn color - luminosity relation depends on both the source of residual scatter and the underlying distribution of color . in  [ sec : model ] we show that if color variation causes the residual scatter , the empirical relation between snia distance and color is well represented by a milky way reddening law . in ",
    "[ sec : consequences ] we discuss implications of different models for snia color , including effects on @xmath4 recovery , how the distance residual bias introduces what appears to be @xmath1 evolution and how host - galaxy - luminosity correlations can be partly explained by the bias . our discussion and conclusions are in  [ sec : discuss ] and  [ sec : conclus ] .",
    "in order to understand the color - luminosity relation of snia , we must define the different components of snia color and how each component is treated by light curve fitters to determine distances . for most of the analysis in this paper",
    ", we employ the salt2 light curve fitter as its empirical framework easily allows for different assumptions and it is one of if the most widely used light curve fitters .",
    "the distance modulus @xmath18 determined by salt2 for each snia is expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the individual fit parameters representing the rest frame b band peak brightness , stretch of the light curve , and color of the sn respectively .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath1 are parameters that represent the absolute magnitude of a standard ia , the slope of the stretch - luminosity relation and the slope of the color - luminosity relation , respectively .",
    "we follow m11 since it accounts for residual scatter in any of the salt2 fit parameters and has the advantage of separating the determination of the salt2 nuisance parameters from a specific cosmology ( see appendix ) .",
    "the error of @xmath18 is assumed to be the quadrature sum of the  noise \" , @xmath25 , and residual scatter applicable to the model,@xmath14 , such that @xmath26 .",
    "the observed color , @xmath27 , can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the model color which is the component of sn color that is linearly correlated with luminosity by @xmath1 .",
    "the residual color @xmath30 is the random color component uncorrelated with luminosity , and @xmath31 is the noise of the color measurement .",
    "conventionally , @xmath32 and the total residual scatter @xmath33 is given as a single number that represents only the residual scatter in the peak b - band luminosity of snia , @xmath20 , as it correlates directly with @xmath34 or @xmath23 .",
    "m11 addresses this assumption , and allows the residual scatter to represent the residual scatter in @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 or combinations of the three .",
    "more generally , this residual scatter for each sn is : @xmath35 @xmath36 represents the @xmath37 residual scatter matrix in @xmath38 and @xmath22 and @xmath39 are its diagonal components .",
    "it is important to note that since @xmath14 includes @xmath24 and @xmath1 terms , these coefficients play a role in not only correcting the distances but also propagating the uncertainty of each distance .",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath1 were not included in the uncertainty , we would find significantly lower values of @xmath24 and @xmath1 .    to understand the consequences of incorrectly attributing the source of the observed distance scatter , we analyze publicly available data from sdss , snls3 and nearby samples .",
    "we include 91 sdss sneia @xcite and 241 snls3 sneia @xcite and a nearby sample comprised of 186 sneia from a variety of sources , most of which are described in @xcite .",
    "the only additions to the @xcite set are 67 sneia from the cfa4 sample @xcite and 34 additional csp sneia @xcite .",

    "we ignore stretch here as luminosity and stretch variation affect the color - luminosity relation in a similar manner .",
    "we find the higher the contribution of color to the residual scatter component , the higher the value of @xmath1 recovered .",
    "because past analyses have assumed @xmath42 , they found the lowest possible value of @xmath1 . attributing the residual scatter to color changes the retrieved value of @xmath1 from 3.2 to 3.7 .",
    "interestingly , we find that @xmath1 is relatively close to the milky way extinction law of @xmath43 when the residual scatter is entirely attributed to color variation , a plausible but unproven possibility . in figure 1 , the snls3 , sdss and nearby samples are combined , though we also find that the dependance of @xmath1 on the source of the residual scatter to be somewhat different for each survey . when residual scatter is attributed entirely to color , we find @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the nearby , snls3 and sdss samples respectively .",
    "for the nearby sample , the value of @xmath1 is consistent with the range of milky way extinction . when residual scatter is attributed entirely to luminosity , we find @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the nearby , snls3 and sdss samples respectively .",
    "an explanation for these differences will be presented in the following section .      to quantify the bias in the recovery of @xmath1 when residual color scatter is ignored",
    ", we must understand the consequences of the previous assumption that @xmath42 in eq .",
    "we define @xmath50 as the color - luminosity relation if there is no color noise or color variation ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 as the color - luminosity relation if there is non - zero color noise and/or color variation ( @xmath53 ) . for a distribution of modeled colors defined by a gaussian of width @xmath54",
    ", we expect the bias in beta recovery to be ( see appendix b for review ) : @xmath55    if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 as assumed in past analyses . however , if @xmath58 , then @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the change in @xmath52 from the true color - luminosity correlation @xmath50 is dependent not only on the presence of residual color scatter but also its size in comparison to the underlying color distribution of snia , @xmath54 .    in order to find the bias in @xmath1 and verify eqn .",
    "4 , we simulate snia samples with different magnitudes of residual color scatter ( @xmath60 ) and widths of gaussian , color model distributions ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "any simulation must replicate the observed color distribution of the real data @xmath61 . because @xmath62 , increasing the magnitude of @xmath63 in the simulations requires that @xmath64 is decreased . the main divergence between this analysis and that of k13 is that k13 does not change @xmath54 when they vary @xmath60 . in table 1",
    ", we show @xmath61 and @xmath65 for each sample , and after assuming the magnitude of color scatter @xmath60 , we find @xmath54 .    for the simulations , we use the snana @xcite simulator , which allows a user to incorporate information such as actual weather history , psf characteristics , spectroscopic follow - up strategies and underlying distributions of color and stretch all towards mimicking a true supernova survey . in order to simulate color or luminosity scatter , we follow the snana procedure that adds random magnitude offsets generated for each sn and observed filter to each light - curve point measured in that filter .",
    "this process is called ` color smearing ' and for simulating luminosity scatter , the additional , random magnitude offset is the same for all filters , while for color scatter , the additional , random magnitude offset is different for each filter .",
    "to estimate the largest bias possible in the recovery in @xmath1 , we simulate supernova samples with scatter entirely due to residual color variation ( @xmath66 ) but in the recovery of @xmath1 we assume @xmath42 and therefore misattribute all of the scatter to luminosity variation ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the simulations used for this exercise have the characteristics of the snls3 survey ( e.g. weather , cadence , seeing , @xmath68 ) , and we fix the simulation input @xmath43 so that the color - luminosity relation is consistent with extinction in the milky way .",
    "we show , in figure 2 , how the magnitude of the bias in the recovery of @xmath52 depends on the relative size of the simulated color variation @xmath60 to the width of the color distribution @xmath54 .",
    "the trend seen from the simulations is in decent agreement with what is predicted from eq .  4 and discrepancies are likely due to covariances between the light curve fit parameters .",
    "while we chose to input @xmath43 in the simulation , the trend seen in fig . 2 would be similar for different input @xmath1 values .",
    "to best estimate this bias in @xmath52 for the individual sdss , snls3 and nearby samples , we take the @xmath54 value for each sample in the color - only case in table 1 .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "2 that for the color - only case we recover on average @xmath69 for these samples , @xmath70 lower than the input value and consistent with the value of @xmath1 seen in the literature @xcite . therefore , we find that the value of @xmath1 regularly quoted as disproving the hypothesis that colors of sneia follow a milky way reddening law falls out naturally from a simulation that has two simple assumptions : the true color - luminosity relation follows the milky way reddening law and hubble residual scatter is due to color variation but misattributed to luminosity variation .",
    "we also offer an explanation of why there should be disagreement on @xmath1 between these supernova samples .",
    "since the @xmath27 distributions of these three samples are different , then for the same @xmath60 value we would expect that @xmath54 is different for each sample , and therefore @xmath52 should vary .",
    "this claim is reasonable as the nearby sample should contain more sneia with higher extinction values than in the sdss or snls3 samples and should have a higher @xmath54 value .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that if @xmath43 and the residual scatter is due to color variation but misattributed to luminosity , then an analysis would find @xmath71 in agreement with past studies .",
    "now we explore the physical assumption that the model color may solely be due to reddening . in this approach , the observed color , @xmath27 ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath72 where the equation is of the same form as eq . 2 but @xmath29 is now replaced with @xmath73 .",
    "mlcs2k2 , which is founded on astrophysical assumptions , denotes an unreddenned color to have an @xmath74 , that according to @xcite , is roughly analogous to a @xmath75 for salt2 appears to be @xmath76 for @xmath74 , though there is a significant amount of scatter . ] . for this physical model of color",
    ", we would therefore expect @xmath77 and that residual color scatter explains colors bluer than @xmath78 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath29 is solely due to reddening has not only physical but also empirical motivations .",
    "k13 found that the model distribution of color is best described by an asymmetric gaussian ( see appendix b for explanation ) with a blue - ward standard deviation which is significantly shorter than the red - ward standard deviation .",
    "a smaller blue range likely implies that most of the color of a sn is due to reddening , rather than some other color related property of the sn .",
    "for the 306 sneia in the combined sdss+snls3+nearby sample with small statistical color errors ( @xmath79 ) , only 35 sne have colors bluer than the @xmath80 cutoff of @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "a residual scatter of @xmath66 is large enough to replicate in a simulation the blue side of the observed distributions of color given an input cutoff at @xmath81 .",
    "we wish to compare how the output color distributions from simulations of two significantly different models of color match the data . for the first model ,",
    "color is due to dust and random variation ; in the second model we take the conventional salt2 approach that there is no color variation .",
    "for the color variation model , we create a simulation with @xmath83 , a model distribution that follows a reddening - only one - sided gaussian ( @xmath84 ) , and residual scatter due to color variation .",
    "the standard deviation of the one - sided gaussian is set so that the output color distribution of this simulation best matches the data , and is roughly equivalent to @xmath85 from table 1 . for the luminosity variation model ,",
    "we create a simulation with @xmath86 and residual scatter due to luminosity variation and the @xmath29 distribution is taken from the default snana distribution described in k13 .    in the previous section , we simulated samples using the m11 ` color smearing ' method which added magnitude variations to each filter . to allow for easier reproducibility of our analysis",
    ", we follow the k13 method in which @xmath14 depends on wavelength . for the luminosity variation case ,",
    "we take the salt2 scatter model ( hereafter called guy10 ) which claims that scatter is relatively independent of wavelength and therefore that the residual scatter is dominated by luminosity . for the color variation case",
    ", we follow @xcite which presents two different color - dominated scatter models in which the scatter has a strong wavelength dependence .",
    "of the two chotard models , we find that the model denoted as c11_0 in k13 is better at reproducing the data .    in figure  3",
    ", we present the color distributions of our two models : the luminosity - variation guy10 model that is typically used in salt2 , and the color - variation dominated c11 model in which model color is solely due to reddening , called the milky - way model .",
    "we find that the observed color distributions of both models reproduce the data .",
    "for the milky - way model , when residual scatter is attributed to luminosity , we find a @xmath1 value near @xmath87 and a similar intrinsic dispersion value as seen in the data of @xmath88 .",
    "this result is interesting because we find that a simulation with the physical , milky way reddening model of color yields the same global fit parameters as the real data itself and this physical model of color has one less free parameter and is thus favored by occam s razor .",
    "the result is in agreement with the results of fig .",
    "2 , though in this case we have an asymmetric @xmath29 that is tied to a physical understanding of color .",
    "while we find simulations with a milky - way reddening model can produce the same color distribution as the conventional salt2 model , we ultimately wish to resolve which model is more accurate .",
    "so far we have observed that the color variation model with @xmath43 and luminosity variation with @xmath89 are degenerate as they both yield @xmath1 values of @xmath90 when scatter is attributed to luminosity .",
    "we hope to break this degeneracy . in fig .  3 , we observe that the milky - way model assumes that blue - ward of @xmath81 , the color results from noise and residual color scatter .",
    "these bluer colors would not be expected to correlate with luminosity in the same way as the redder colors .",
    "the conventional salt2 luminosity - variation model assumes that blue and red colors would be identically correlated with distance .    to test these two predictions , we analyze the hubble residuals after including a color - correction with @xmath89 for all our samples . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hatfield ] , we show that in the snls3+sdss+nearby data , there are effectively different color - luminosity relations for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the conventional salt2 model predicts that @xmath1 should be unchanged over the color range , while the mlcs2k2 milky - way model predicts a bifurcation because of the @xmath74 cutoff and the long exponential reddening tail .",
    "the color - luminosity relations shown are found using simple , linear fits to the data .",
    "we see that the bifurcated slopes of the real data appear to match those from the milky - way prediction ( @xmath93 differences ) significantly better than the conventional salt2 prediction ( @xmath94 differences ) . by analyzing each color range independently",
    ", we may break the degeneracy between the physical model of color and the conventional salt2 model , and find that the physical model is empirically optimal .",
    "the inconsistent @xmath1 values found for blue and red colors are also seen in @xcite ; they find a @xmath95 between sneia with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "lastly , we note that while the c11 color model is used for this test , the simple color - smearing model in snana produces similar results .",
    "so far when we have compared the @xmath1 values from these two approaches towards snia color , we have assumed , correct or otherwise , that the hubble scatter from each model is due to luminosity .",
    "we have done this in order to explore the biases that would be present in other snia analyses , if that conventional assumption is correct .",
    "we may also attempt to analyze the data when we assume that the hubble residual scatter is entirely due to color variation and that there is a dust cutoff of @xmath98 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no formalism to incorporate any kind of bayesian prior in salt2 .",
    "we introduce here a simple bayesian algorithm applied to salt2 ( hereafter called balt ) that allows for the possibility that color follows the physical model outlined above .",
    "once salt2 finds a color from the light curve fit , we apply a bayesian prior @xcite to the color such that @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the corrected color , @xmath27 is the color from the light curve fit , @xmath101 is the noise from the color measurement and @xmath102 is a normalization constant . the second part of eq .",
    "6 describes the bayesian prior for the model color as shown in the bottom panel of fig . 3 where @xmath103 is the blue cutoff of the distribution ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "@xmath104 describes the shape of the one sided gaussian due to extinction for a given redshift @xmath105 for each survey @xmath106 ; the dependance of @xmath107 on survey and redshift allows selection effects to be modeled ( following @xcite ) . from the previous subsection",
    ", we expect that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . at higher redshifts , @xmath107 decreases since only sne with bluer colors",

    "we estimate the uncertainty of @xmath114 by varying this value for the model distributions in the simulations , and observing how well the simulated @xmath27 distribution compares to the data .",
    "doing so , we find @xmath115 .    if eq .",
    "6 is applied to each sn color of the sdss+snls3+nearby sample , we find a very significant reduction in the total @xmath116 of the sample and the intrinsic dispersion needed to bring @xmath117 to unity . following the conventional salt2 approach where scatter is attributed to luminosity , we determine that the total @xmath118 and @xmath119 . with the balt approach , setting @xmath43 , the total @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "interestingly , if we exclude the nearby sample , the total @xmath122 for the balt approach whereas @xmath123 for the conventional salt2 approach .",
    "part of the reason that the total intrinsic dispersion ( @xmath124 mag ) is so low after the balt correction for the sdss and snls3 samples is that due to selection effects , the model color range of the sne that are followed - up is very narrow .",
    "we note that for this sample , simply forcing all sne with @xmath125 to have @xmath81 reduces the @xmath117 to 1.26 .",
    "the main argument against correcting the colors a posteriori is that it ignores covariances between color and the other fit parameters ; however , from guy10 we expect those covariances to be small . there is currently work being done on a sophisticated bayesian hierarchical approach to salt2 ( march et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the balt algorithm applied here shows the promise of this approach .",
    "the conventional method of not applying a prior to the color distribution is equivalent to applying a flat bayesian prior , which itself may bias the analysis .",
    "a more complete exploration of the balt method will be presented in the upcoming ps1 systematics paper ( scolnic et al . in prep ) .",
    "so far we have shown that two prominent approaches for handling sn color are degenerate , and we have introduced a method to break this degeneracy .",
    "now we ask : to what degree do we bias our measurement of @xmath4 when we make an incorrect assumption about the nature of sn color and the source of sn scatter ?    to address this question , we use the snana program and its default simulation inputs to simulate the nearby , sdss and snls3 sample ( see k13 for review ) .",
    "we simulate two types of samples : one with the color variation model and the other with the luminosity variation model as described in the previous section . for each survey",

    "we note though that for both salt2 @xcite and balt , there is a remaining trend between color and hubble residuals .",
    "if we correct the distance modulus of each sn for this trend , the mass - hubble residual effect is decreased by @xmath127 mag .",
    "therefore we conclude that accounting for color variation may weaken the trend between host galaxy properties and hubble residuals , but this reduction alone is not large enough to explain the trend between hubble residuals and host galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that there is a non - negligible change in the color - luminosity relation with redshift in the sdss and snls3 samples respectively .",
    "we now explore whether the observed change of @xmath1 with redshift results from color variation .",
    "lcccc snls3 & @xmath152 & @xmath153 & @xmath154&@xmath155 + sdss & @xmath156 & @xmath157 & @xmath158 & @xmath159 +    to understand the dependence of @xmath1 evolution on the source of scatter , we compare the values for recovered @xmath1 evolution from real data samples and simulations of different sources of scatter . the results",
    "are shown in table 3 . we determine @xmath1 and @xmath160 together , and we attribute the residual scatter to luminosity variation .",
    "we find that the guy10 , luminosity variation model , predicts negligible @xmath1 evolution ( for snls3 : @xmath161 ) , even though the amount is significant in the real data ( for snls3 : @xmath162 ) .",
    "we simulate with two different color variation models : the color smear model discussed in section 2 and the c11 model discussed in section 3 . the difference between these two models",
    "is that the magnitude of color variation in the c11 model is higher at the blue end of the snia spectral model , which is sampled at high - z .",
    "we find that the c11 model better predicts @xmath1 evolution .",
    "we also note that when we allow a non - zero @xmath160 for the real data , @xmath163 , which is near the milky way extinction value .",
    "this implies that color appears to follow the milky way reddening law at low - z where scatter , noise and selection effects are weaker .",
    "one other possible explanation @xcite for @xmath1 evolution is that at higher redshifts , the color range decreases , and there is less leverage from the tails of the color distribution to help determine @xmath1 .",
    "however , we find that if we reduce the color range of the sample , the observed @xmath1 evolution becomes negligible .",
    "if residual scatter originates from color variation , then understanding the cause of color variation is paramount .",
    "much focus in the last few years has been placed on the relation between host galaxy properties and hubble residuals .",
    "since host galaxy properties correlate with stretch and color , we stress that a correction to the distance modulus after light curve corrections are done may not be the ideal method .",
    "this approach is analogous to observing the correlation between hubble residuals and color , finding a property like velocity that correlates with color , and removing the bias by finding a relation between hubble residual and velocity",
    ". a better approach for these scenarios may be to use the host galaxy or velocity information to inform the priors in which the color or stretch values are found .",
    "we have begun to explore how to incorporate bayesian prior information into the salt2 light curve fitter .",
    "the balt approach reduces the intrinsic dispersion in the sample to nearly null , which shows the promise of this approach .",
    "biases from introducing a bayesian prior still need to be explored , though we reiterate that not including a prior is equivalent to using a flat prior .",
    "there are currently fitters , like bayesn @xcite , that include detailed bayesian priors already , and these offer helpful guidance .",
    "@xcite also explores the consistency of infrared observations of sneia with a mw reddening law and finds they are consistent .",
    "@xcite reaches a similar conclusion for the majority of the sne with normal ( @xmath164 ) extinction values .",
    "while we have shown how biases in @xmath1 and @xmath4 depend on the width and shape of the model color distribution , there are further complexities to an understanding of this distribution . for our dust models , we assume that the peak of the model color distribution is at the @xmath74 limit .",
    "it is possible that the peak is actually more red than this blue cutoff , as suggested from the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we have also assumed that residual variation in color or luminosity is gaussian .",
    "however , @xcite show that the velocity of sneia is tied to color , and sneia are not distributed evenly among high and low velocities .",
    "furthermore , we have not yet explored the consistency of infrared observations with the analysis done here .",
    "finally , we mention that although the focus of this paper has been on the salt2 fitter , the biases discussed in this paper will affect any light curve fitter that assumes the source of residual scatter among most sneia is due to luminosity variation or ignores the effects of the underlying color distribution .",
    "another potentially fruitful path to characterizing intrinsic scatter is to reduce it through further sub - typing or discovery of additional sn parameters .",
    "in this paper , we have explained how fitting snia distances depends on assumptions about the residual scatter of snia .",
    "we have also introduced a discussion of the biases due to ignorance of the model color distribution .",
    "we show that the combination of residual scatter due to color and a realistic color distribution will bias @xmath1 by roughly @xmath165 lower than its true value .",
    "we find that a model in which color is solely due to milky way - like reddening along with residual color variation can explain the trend between hubble residuals and color seen in the snls3 , sdss and nearby data sets .",
    "we also argue that an empirical - only analysis of light curve data contains multiple degenerate parameters , and further progress may stem from including astrophysical priors .",
    "we have shown one method to include knowledge of the color model as a bayesian prior , and how this approach significantly reduces the intrinsic dispersion in the sample .    finally , the ultimate goal for snia analysis is to measure cosmological parameters .",
    "we find that misattributing the source of residual scatter can bias @xmath4 by as much as @xmath166 .",
    "this amount has been significantly underestimated in the past .",
    "further improvements in the determination of @xmath4 may come from a better understanding of the residual scatter of snia and the true nature of snia color .",
