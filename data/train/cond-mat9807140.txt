    "excitons in semiconductor crystals @xcite and nanostructures @xcite are a very interesting and challenging object to search for the process of bose einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "nowadays there is a lot of experimental evidence that the optically inactive para - excitons in cu@xmath0o can form a highly correlated state , or the excitonic bose einstein condensate @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a moving condensate of para - excitons in a 3d cu@xmath0o crystal turns out to be spatially inhomogeneous in the direction of motion , and the registered velocities of coherent exciton packets turn out to be always less , but approximately equal to the longitudinal sound speed of the crystal @xcite .    analyzing recent experimental @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and theoretical @xcite-@xcite studies of bec of excitons in cu@xmath1o , we can conclude that there are essentially two different stages of this process .",
    "the first stage is the kinetic one , with the characteristic time scale of @xmath2ns . at this stage ,",
    "a condensate of long - living para - excitons begins to be formed from a quasi - equilibrium degenerate state of excitons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) when the concentration and the effective temperature of excitons in a cloud meet the conditions of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "note that we do not discuss here the behavior of ortho - excitons ( with the lifetime @xmath5ns ) and their influence on the para - exciton condensation process . for more details about the ortho - excitons in cu@xmath1o , ortho - para - exciton conversion , etc .",
    "see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the kinetic stage is that formation of the para - exciton condensate and the process of momentum transfer to the para - exciton cloud are happening simultaneously .",
    "it seems that nonequilibrium acoustic phonons ( appearing at the final stage of exciton cloud cooling ) play the key role in the process of momentum transfer .",
    "indeed , the theoretical results obtained in the framework of the `` phonon wind '' model @xcite,@xcite and the experimental observations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite are the strong arguments in favor of this idea . to the authors knowledge , there are no realistic theoretical models of the kinetic stage of para - exciton condensate formation where quantum degeneracy of the initial exciton state and possible coherence of nonequilibrium phonons pushing the excitons would be taken into account . indeed , the condensate formation and many other processes involving it are essentially nonliner ones .",
    "therefore , the condensate , or , better , the macroscopically occupied mode , can be different from @xmath6 , and the language of the states in @xmath7-space and their occupation numbers @xmath8 may be not relevant to the problem , see @xcite .    in this study , we will not explore the stage of condensate formation .",
    "instead , we investigate the second , quasi - equilibrium stage , in which the condensate has already been formed and it moves through a crystal with some constant velocity and characteristic shape of the density profile . in theory , the time scale of this `` transport '' stage , @xmath9 , could be determined by the para - exciton lifetime ( @xmath10s @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "it is determined by the characteristic size @xmath11 of a high - quality single crystal available for experiments : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "we assume that at the `` transport '' stage , the temperature of the moving packet ( condensed@xmath14noncondensed particles ) is equal to the lattice temperature , @xmath15 then we can consider first the simplest case of @xmath16 and disregard the influence of all sorts of _ nonequilibrium _ phonons ( which appear at the stages of exciton formation , thermalization @xcite ) on the formed moving condensate .",
    "any theory of the exciton bec in cu@xmath0o has to point out some physical mechanism(s ) by means of which the key experimental facts can be explained .",
    "( for example , the condensate moves without friction within a narrow interval of velocities localized near @xmath13 , and the shape of the stable macroscopic wave function of excitons resembles soliton profiles @xcite . ) here we explore a simple model of exciton - phonon condensate . in this case , the general structure of the hamiltonian of the moving exciton packet and the lattice phonons is the following : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the bose - field operator describing the excitons , @xmath19 is the field operator of lattice displacements , @xmath20 is the momentum density operator canonically conjugate to @xmath19 , @xmath21 is the exciton packet velocity and , finally , @xmath22 is the momentum operator .",
    "note that the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is written in the reference frame moving with the exciton packet , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the packet velocity .",
    "to derive the equations of motion of the field operators ( and generalize these equations to the case of @xmath25 ) , it is more convenient , however , to start from the lagrangian . in the proposed model , the lagrangian density has the form @xmath26 @xmath27 - e_g^ - ^2 ^ - _ 0",
    "( ^(*x*,t))^2 ( ( * x*,t))^2 - _ 1(^ ( * x*,t))^3((*x*,t))^3 + @xmath28 + ( _ t)^2 -c_l^2 _ j_s_j_s - v_t_x + v^2(_x)^2- @xmath27 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the exciton `` bare''mass ( @xmath31 for @xmath32sexcitons in cu@xmath0o ) , @xmath33 is the exciton - exciton interaction constant ( @xmath34 that corresponds to the repulsive interaction between para - excitons in cu@xmath0o @xcite ) , @xmath35 is the crystal density , @xmath36 is the exciton - longitudinal phonon coupling constant , and @xmath37 .",
    "the energy of a free exciton is @xmath38 .",
    "although the validity of the condition @xcite @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the exciton bohr radius ) makes it possible to disregard all the multiple - particle interactions with more than two participating particles in @xmath41 , we leave the hard - core repulsion term originated from the three - particle interaction in @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for simplicity s sake",
    ", we take all the interaction terms in @xmath45 in the _ local _ form and disregard the interaction between the excitons and transverse phonons .",
    "the packet velocity @xmath46 is one of the parameters of the theory , and we will not take into account the excitonic normal component and velocity , @xmath47",
    ".    the equations of motion can be easily derived by the standard variational method from the following condition : @xmath48 indeed , after transforming the bose - fields @xmath49 and @xmath18 by @xmath50 we can write these equations as follows : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    we assume that the condensate of excitons exists .",
    "this means that the following representation of the exciton bose - field holds : @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 is the classical part of the field operator @xmath18 or , in other words , the condensate wave function , and @xmath56 is the fluctuational part of @xmath18 , which describes noncondensed particles .",
    "one of the important objects in the theory of bec is the correlation functions of bose - fields . the standard way to calculate them in this model ( the excitonic function @xmath57 , for example , )",
    "can be based on the effective action or the effective hamiltonian approaches @xcite . indeed",
    ", one can , first , integrate over the phonon variables @xmath58 , get the expression for @xmath59 and , second , use @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) to derive the equations of motion for @xmath62 , @xmath56 , correlation functions , etc ..    in this work we do not follow that way ; instead , we treat excitons and phonons equally @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this means that the displacement field @xmath19 can have a nontrivial classical part too , i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the actual moving condensate can be an exciton - phonon one , i.e. @xmath65 . then the equation of motion for the classical parts of the fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be derived by use of the variational method from @xmath66 , where all the fields can be considered as the classical ones . eventually we have @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 notice that deriving these equations we disregarded the interaction between the classical ( condensate ) and the fluctuational ( noncondensate ) parts of the fields .",
    "that is certainly a good approximation for @xmath16 and @xmath70 cases @xcite .    in this article a steady - state of the condensate",
    "is the object of the main interest . in the co - moving frame of reference , the condensate steady - state is just the stationary solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq11]),([eq22 ] ) and it can be taken in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the real number functions , and @xmath74 is the ( macroscopic ) phase of the condensate wave function .",
    "( this phase can be taken zeroth if only a single condensate is the subject of interest . )",
    "then , the following equations have to be solved : @xmath75 @xmath76 indeed , the last equation can be solved relative to @xmath77 . if @xmath78 , the corresponding solution can be represented as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 can be expressed in terms of the green function of eq .",
    "( [ eq222 ] ) . substituting @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ eq111 ] ) , we rewrite the latter in the following form : @xmath83 where the effective exciton - exciton interaction @xmath84 is induced by the lattice ( @xmath85 ) . it can be represented as follows : @xmath86 @xmath87 the first ( isotropic ) term in ( [ potential ] ) causes the renormalization of the exciton - exciton interaction constant @xmath88 : @xmath89 note that @xmath90 can be positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath91 .",
    "the second term in the effective potential ( [ potential ] ) is strongly anisotropic .",
    "moreover , on the cylinder @xmath92 , its value is negative in the vicinity of @xmath93 and positive at the large scales of @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .    the possibility of the existence of specific and to some extent unexpected solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 3deq ] ) follows from the fact that the effective two particle interaction between excitons can be attractive at small distances between the particles and repulsive at large distances .",
    "for example , the wave function @xmath96 may become strongly localized in 3d space because of this attraction .    if @xmath97 , the formulas for @xmath98 and @xmath99 are very similar to those obtained in the case of @xmath78 .",
    "for instance , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq222 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath100 ( here @xmath101 ) .",
    "again , the renormalization ( [ renorm ] ) takes place and a nonisotropic part of @xmath102 appears in eq .",
    "( [ 3deq ] ) .",
    "however , the effective two - particle interaction between excitons remains repulsive , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "solving eqs . ( [ eq111]),([eq222 ] ) in 3d space seems to be a difficult problem ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 3deq]),([potential ] ) ) . however , these equations can be essentially simplified if we assume that the condensate is inhomogeneous along the @xmath94-axis only , that is @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    ". such an effective reduction of dimensionality transforms the difficult integro - differential equation ( [ 3deq ] ) into a rather simple differential one , and obtained in this way the effective 1d model for the condensate wave function @xmath106 conserves all the important properties of the `` parent '' 3d model . indeed , if @xmath78 , the following equations stand for the condensate : @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 . if @xmath110 , eq . ( [ 1deq ] ) describes the excitonic part of the condensate , but with the enhanced effective repulsion @xmath111 .",
    "the effective two - particle interaction constant @xmath90 is negative if the velocity of the condensate lies inside the interval @xmath112 , where @xmath113 can be called the first ` critical ' velocity in the model .",
    "( note that outside this interval @xmath114 @xcite . )    the estimate value of the threshold velocity @xmath115 can be obtained from the following formula : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the relative volume deformation potential of a semiconductor , ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath119 and ry are the exciton and atom rydberg energies , @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the lattice constant .",
    "( the repulsive exciton - exciton interaction is taken in the form @xmath122 ) . in the case of cu@xmath0o oxide",
    ", we have @xmath123 .    in this study",
    "we will consider the case of @xmath112 in detail .",
    "if the sign of the effective two - particle interaction can vary , an extra ( repulsive ) term should be included into the hamiltonian of a many - particle system to insure the finiteness of a steady - state wave function or the absence of wave function collapse in dynamic processes . in our case , it is the term @xmath124 , and @xmath125 is supposed to be the smallest energy parameter in the theory . in the framework of the considered 1d model , however , a finite steady - state solution of eqs .",
    "( [ 1deq]),([11deq ] ) can be obtained without accounting for the `` hard core '' repulsion term @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , we can write out the corresponding solution as follows : @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129    the amplitudes of the exciton and phonon parts of the condensate , the characteristic width of the condensate , @xmath130 , and the value of the effective chemical potential @xmath131 depend on the normalization of the exciton wave function @xmath132 .",
    "we normalize it in 3d space assuming that the characteristic width of the packet in the @xmath133 plane is finite and the cross - section area of the packet can be made equal to the cross - section area s of a laser beam",
    ". then we can write this condition as follows : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the number of condensed excitons . immediately",
    ", we get the following results : @xmath136 @xmath137 the important `` nonlinear '' property of the obtained solution ( [ soliton ] ) is the dependence of the amplitudes of exciton and phonon parts of the condensate on the velocity @xmath91 and the number of excitons in the condensate , @xmath135 . for example",
    ", @xmath138 stands for the exciton amplitude .",
    "notice that the characteristic width of the condensate and its velocity are not independent parameters , see ( [ amplitude ] ) . for estimates ,",
    "the formula for @xmath139 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the average density of excitons in the soliton state .",
    "although @xmath142 in this formula is multiplied by a small factor , this factor is not small enough to show quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed value of @xmath139 , @xmath143 .",
    "it seems to be reasonable that a theory with nonzero temperature ( @xmath144 ) will provide a more realistic value of the effective size of the packet .",
    "returning to the laboratory reference frame , we can write the condensate wave function in the form : @xmath145 @xmath146 where we count the exciton energy from the bottom of the crystal valence band ; @xmath147 is the amplitude of the phonon part of condensate and @xmath148 . to calculate the energy of the moving condensate within the lagrangian approach , ( see eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) ) , we have to integrate the zeroth component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath149 over the spatial coordinates , @xmath150 we do not take into account the small correction to this energy due to the quantum depletion of the condensate as well as the term @xmath151 in @xmath149 .",
    "then the result reads : @xmath152 @xmath153 the value @xmath154 is a rather small parameter , @xmath155 and the energy of the phonon part of the condensate is estimated as @xmath156 .",
    "however , the back surface of the crystal will experience some pressure when the condensate reaches this surface and the excitons are destroyed near it .",
    "the estimation of the maximum value of the pressure in a pulse is as follows : @xmath157 and the main contribution to this value comes from the phonon part .",
    "indeed , one can see that the exciton - phonon condensate carries a nonzeroth momentum @xmath158 : @xmath159 d*x * ( / 2i)(_0^*(x , t)_x_0(x ,",

    "although the condensate wave function @xmath161 was obtained in the framework of the effective 1d model , ( but normalized in 3d space ) , we will use this solution as a classical part in the 3d field operator decomposition : @xmath162 @xmath163 where @xmath164 . substituting the field operators of the form ( [ hatpsi]),([hatu ] ) into the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian ] ) ,",
    "we can write the later in the following form : @xmath165 where @xmath166 stands for the classical part of @xmath45 , and @xmath167 is the bilinear form in the @xmath168-operators .",

    "indeed , decomposition of the field operators near their nontrivial classical parts leads to the decomposition of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) itself , and  as it was done with the lagrangian  only the classical part of @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and the bilinear form in the fluctuating fields , @xmath177 , are left for examination : @xmath178 in this approximation , the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) can be diagonalized and rewritten in the form : @xmath179 here , @xmath180 is the quantum correction to the energy of the condensate and the index @xmath181 labels the elementary excitations of the system .",
    "the operators @xmath182 , @xmath183 are the bose ones , and they can be represented by linear combinations of the exciton and displacement field operators : @xmath184 @xmath185 note that by analogy with the exciton - polariton modes in semiconductors@xcite the excitations of the condensate ( [ movingcond ] ) can be considered as a mixture of the exciton- and phonon - type modes , but in this model the phonons come from fluctuations of the @xmath186-part of the condensate .    since the @xmath187-operators ( see ( [ ham3 ] ) ) evolve in time as simply as @xmath188 these operators ( and the frequencies @xmath189 ) are the eigenvectors ( and , correspondingly , the eigenvalues ) of the equations of motion ( [ deltapsi]),([deltau ] ) obtained within the lagrangian method .",

    "then we can roughly estimate the maximum value of @xmath284 in the low energy limit ( @xmath285 , @xmath286 ) : @xmath287    to investigate the stability of the moving condensate in relation to the creation of inside excitations , we can calculate the energy of the condensate with the _ one _ inside excitation described by the following set : @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath291 , and @xmath292 .",
    "although such an excitation was defined in the co - moving frame , calculations should be done in the laboratory frame .",
    "returning to the lab frame , we represent the exciton and phonon field functions as follows : @xmath293 @xmath294 @xmath295 as the inside excitation is considered as an fluctuation , the number of particles in the condensate and its energy can be estimated as @xmath296 and @xmath297 , respectively .",
    "the zeroth component of the energy - momentum tensor can be represented in the form @xmath298 where the first part gives the condensate energy @xmath299 and the second part will give the energy of the inside excitation , @xmath300 .",
    "after substitution of ( [ urfin]),([urfin1 ] ) into @xmath301 , it can be rewritten as follows : @xmath302 the first term appearing in ( [ bbb ] ) , @xmath303 , vanishes in the following formula for the total energy : @xmath304 @xmath305 here the last two terms compensate each other approximately , and all the interesting effects come form the exciton part of ( [ stable ] ) .",
    "although @xmath306 can be negative , its negative value can be compensated by the term @xmath307 if the velocity of the condensate is close to @xmath13 or the exciton concentration is high enough .",
    "therefore , there is a second critical velocity @xmath308 in the theory .",
    "if the velocity of the condensate is less then the velocity @xmath308 and @xmath309 , the condensate is unstable in relation to creation of the inside excitations , i.e. @xmath310 in the lab frame . to estimate the value of @xmath308",
    ", we solve the following equation : @xmath311 which can be reduced to @xmath312 .",
    "for example , for the packets with the exciton concentration of @xmath313@xmath314 , the estimate is as follows : @xmath315",
    "there are at least two interesting problems that can be examined in the framework of the proposed model ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq11],[eq22 ] ) ) .",
    "the first problem is the investigation of the condensate steady - state and its stability , calculation of the low - lying excitation spectrum , etc .. ( some part of this program was presented in the previous sections . )",
    "the second one is the investigation of interference between two moving packets @xcite . in this case",
    "the problem is essentially nonstationary .",
    "indeed , the amplitude and the shape of the resultant moving packet are expected to change in time @xcite .",
    "these effects , however , can be considered theoretically by a numerical solving of eqs .",
    "( [ eq11]),([eq22 ] ) with the proper initial conditions .",
    "( we will disregard the influence of noncondensed particles , the condensate depletion and nonequilibrium phonons on the dynamic processes being considered . ) for example , if two `` input '' packets have the same velocity ( @xmath316 ) and shape , we can write the initial conditions in the form @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the macroscopical phase difference between the two `` input '' condensates , and @xmath319 is the time delay between them .    in the simplest",
    "( quasi-1d ) model , the following equations govern the dynamics of the two `` input '' packets : @xmath320 @xmath321 then the initial conditions ( [ conditions ] ) can be written in the explicit 1d form by using the exact solution ( [ soliton ] ) of the model ( [ 1deq],[11deq ] ) . note that the amplitudes of @xmath132 and @xmath322 are defined from the normalization condition and depend on the values of @xmath91 and @xmath135 , and , hence , the amplitudes of the `` input '' condensates in ( [ conditions ] ) have the same values .",
    "some predictions of the form of the expected solution can be made easily .",
    "indeed , the shape and other characteristics of the steady - state solution of ( [ timedep1d]),([conditions ] ) will depend mainly on the value of the parameter @xmath323 where @xmath324 and @xmath139 is the characteristic condensate width .",
    "if @xmath325 , the nonlinear interaction between the packets plays an important role in the process of total wave function formation .",
    "( notice that the lower limit of @xmath326 , @xmath327 , is defined by the time scale of formation of a condensate wave function . )",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in the limit of strong interaction between condensates , the @xmath328 excitons can form the _ single _ condensate wave function ( [ soliton ] ) in the steady - state regime .",
    "then this wave function can be written ( in the laboratory frame ) as follows : @xmath329 @xmath330 as the dynamic equations ( [ timedep1d]),([timedep1dd ] ) conserve the energy , @xmath331 @xmath332 can not be equal to @xmath91 in theory",
    ". moreover , if the parameter @xmath323 is small enough , it can be only the approximate equality , @xmath333 .    in the case of @xmath334 , one can disregard the influence of the mutual nonlinear interaction on the dynamics of the packets . in this approximation",
    ", the packet moving in the crystal can be modeled by the following formula : @xmath335 @xmath336    an interesting and noninvestigated case in the interference problem is the condensate dynamics after posing nonsymmetric initial conditions .",
    "in fact , the amplitude and the velocity of the `` input '' packets can be different , for example , @xmath337 and @xmath338 , @xmath339 .",
    "we use here the experimental result @xcite that at @xmath340 , the velocity of the condensate depends on the laser power or , equivalently , on the initial concentration of excitons , i.e. @xmath341 .",
    "( note that in theory the exciton amplitude @xmath342 is the function of @xmath135 and @xmath91 . )",
    "if the exciton concentration in the first packet , @xmath343 , is close to the bose condensation threshold value and the exciton concentration in the second packet , @xmath344 , can be made @xmath345 , the velocity difference between condensates can reach @xmath346 . then , in the reference frame moving with the first packet , the initial conditions can be taken as the following : @xmath347 @xmath348 where @xmath349 , @xmath350 , and the second packet moves in this frame of reference . in the case of such the initial conditions",
    ", the regime of strong nonlinear interaction between the condensates is unavoidable . following the logic of the soliton theory , we speculate that the steady - state solution may consist of two packets moving with different velocities and with different exciton concentrations . roughly speaking",
    ", the `` input '' packets could exchange their places , i.e. the _ both _ packets survive after collision , and the first packet arrives at the `` detecting '' boundary of a crystal after the second one : @xmath351 @xmath352 @xmath353 however , the hypothesis about the solitonic character of packet collisions in 3d needs both numerical and experimental evidence .",
    "in this study , we considered a model within which the inhomogeneous excitonic condensate with a nonzero momentum can be investigated .",
    "the important physics we include in our model is the exciton - phonon interaction and the appearance of a coherent part of the crystal displacement field that makes the moving condensate of the exciton - phonon one .",
    "then , the condensate wave function and its energy can be calculated exactly in the simplest quasi-1d model .",
    "we believe that the transport and other unusual properties of the coherent para - exciton packets in cu@xmath0o can be described in the framework of the proposed model properly generalized to meet more realistic conditions .",
    "as the exciton - phonon interaction is very important in any processes involving excitons in lattices @xcite , we can speculate about the possibility of use of piezoelectrical transducers to pump acoustic waves into the system condensate@xmath14lattice .",
    "moreover , the transducers could be used to register the phonon part of the coherent packet in experiments in which the condensate is formed by optically inactive excitons and phonons .",
    "we showed that there are two critical velocities in the theory , @xmath354 and @xmath308 .",
    "the first one , @xmath354 , comes from the renormalization of two particle exciton - exciton interaction due to phonons , and the inhomogeneous soliton state can be formed if @xmath340 .",
    "the second one , @xmath308 , comes from use of landau arguments @xcite for investigation of the dynamical stability / instability of the moving condensate . within the semiclassical approximation for the condensate excitations",
    ", we found the condensate is unstable if @xmath355 .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the possibility of observation of such an instability when the condensate can be formed in the inhomogeneous state with @xmath356 , but with @xmath357 .",
    "such a coherent packet has to disappear during its move through a single pure crystal used for experiments .",
    "as the shape of the moving packet depends on time , the form of the registered signal may depend on the crystal length changing from the solitonic to the standard diffusion density profile .",
    "we did not concentrate on detailed investigation of excited states of the moving exciton - phonon condensate in this study .",
    "first , the possibility of their observation is an unclear question itself .",
    "second , the stability conditions of the moving condensate  in relation to the creation of condensate excitations  can be derived from the low energy asymptotics of the excitation spectra at @xmath358",
    ". however , the stability problem is not without difficulties @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one can easily imagine the situation when the condensate moves in a very high quality crystal , but with some impurity region carefully prepared in the middle of the sample .",
    "then the impurities could bound the noncondensed excitons , which always accompany the condensate , and could mediate , for instance , the emission of the outside excitations .",
    "the last process may lead to depletion of the condensate and , perhaps , some other observable effects , such as damping , bound exciton pl , etc .. on the other hand , the inside excitations could manifest themselves at @xmath359 by the effective enlargement of the packet length , @xmath360 , @xmath359 , or by interaction with external acoustic waves .",
