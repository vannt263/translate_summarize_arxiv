    "in this paper , we study the measurement of quark and gluon distribution functions inside the proton at very small momentum fractions @xmath1 .",
    "we consider several processes in @xmath0 collisions at a center - of - mass energy @xmath3 of 14 tev and show that the range of useful measurements extends down to about @xmath4 for most processes , and even down to @xmath5 for the drell - yan process .",
    "the relevant regions in @xmath1 are scaled up by a factor of @xmath6 . ]",
    "such measurements require a detector which has sufficient acceptance at maximal rapidities .",
    "plans for building a detector of this type ( felix ) are under discussion at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we show how the parton densities may be determined .",
    "the event rates are high ; to estimate them , we use the cteq3 m distributions @xcite to provide an extrapolation from the region where measurements currently exist , which is @xmath7 .    although our results are obtained for proton - proton interactions , a similar analysis can easily be applied to proton - nucleus interactions in the same accelerator .",
    "for example , in the case of proton - calcium collisions , at say a center - of - mass energy of 63 tev , the same region , down to @xmath4 and lower , can also be probed .",
    "we show how data from such studies would provide information on the parton densities in nuclei at both large and small @xmath1 .",
    "previous data for hard processes on nuclei have been confined to fixed - target energies , and so the range of processes for which perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations are reliable is limited .    at the lhc ,",
    "the integrated luminosity for a proton - proton luminosity of @xmath8 and a run - time of @xmath9 is @xmath10 .",
    "however , there is a loss of luminosity in proton - nucleus collisions ; for protons on calcium , a luminosity of @xmath11 with a shorter running time is envisaged .",
    "this loss of luminosity is to a large extent compensated by increased cross sections , which are approximately proportional to the mass number @xmath12 for large @xmath1 . at small @xmath1",
    ", the cross sections presumably behave more like @xmath13 , but as we will see , the event rates are so large that the resulting loss of event - rate relative to proton - proton collisions will still enable a lot of physics to be probed .",
    "we consider the following hadronic processes at center of mass energy @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a photon , @xmath18 a lepton pair , @xmath19 a heavy quark ( antiquark ) and @xmath20 are the weak vector - bosons .",
    "to calculate the cross sections , we use the pqcd formalism , with the lowest - order hard scattering cross sections found , for example , in refs .  @xcite . for the production of jets , photons and heavy quarks ,",
    "we impose a cut @xmath21 , which will keep us in the region where perturbative calculations are applicable .",
    "since our main interest is to probe parton densities at small @xmath1 , we will mostly need asymmetric configurations of the momentum fractions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , of the partons entering the hard scattering . from the kinematic inequality",
    "@xmath24 we deduce that the momentum fractions obey @xmath25 .",
    "high - energy data on soft hadron production indicate @xcite that for fixed @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the particle rapidity , the soft hadronic multiplicity does not increase with energy , although at @xmath28 it grows rapidly with @xmath29 .",
    "thus , for the large values of @xmath27 that we use in this analysis , soft interactions result in much smaller underlying event @xmath30 pedestals than for @xmath31 at lhc energies .",
    "moreover , for @xmath1 substantially larger than @xmath32 , the counting rates are so high for moderate @xmath33 of the jets ( in processes j@xmath17 and jj in expression ( [ gnricpro ] ) ) that it would be possible to restrict the analysis to the region of sufficiently large @xmath1 ( for one of the partons ) so that the jets are still produced at large @xmath27 . indeed , the expected rates are so high that it would be also possible to check the role of the pedestals by taking data at several @xmath1 bins .",
    "hence , our choice of @xmath34 appears safe .",
    "since our interest is only in estimating rates and not in a detailed extraction of parton densities from data , it will be sufficient to perform leading - order calculations for most of the processes considered .",
    "of course , when actual data become available , it will be necessary to fit the parton densities to the data with the aid of theoretical formulae at the best possible accuracy , at least next - to - leading order .    at small @xmath1 ,",
    "the gluon density is substantially larger than the quark densities . since at lowest order ,",
    "the drell - yan and vector - boson processes are given by quark - antiquark annihilation , without a gluon - induced subprocess , we will calculate these processes to next - to - leading order , with the hard - scattering coefficients in the @xmath35 scheme found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for jet , photon and heavy - quark production",
    ", we will set the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath36 to the commonly used value of @xmath37 . for drell - yan and vector - boson production ,",
    "we set @xmath38 to the pair mass and vector - boson mass , respectively .",
    "we calculate the cross section for producing a jet and a photon , putting the events in bins of @xmath37 and @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the minimum of the momentum fractions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , of the incoming partons .",
    "the @xmath1 bin is defined by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 with @xmath41 , while the bin size in @xmath33 is set to 20% of the central value up to @xmath42 and 40% beyond this @xmath33 value .",
    "these same bin sizes are also used in the other cross sections computed in this paper .",
    "the cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ pjptx1 ] correspond to the kinematic region @xmath43 one sees that large cross sections ( above 10 pb ) are obtained for @xmath37 up to about 100 gev . combined with a luminosity of @xmath44 , this gives at least hundreds of events in every bin , which will give good statistical precision .",
    "the strong fall - off of the curves at their left end is a result of approaching the kinematic limit : @xmath45 . to get a useful number of events ,",
    "it is sufficient for @xmath1 to be about twice its limit .",
    "the cross section is dominated by gluon - quark scattering . in fig .",
    "[ pjx1 ] , the cross section integrated over @xmath46 is split into @xmath47 and @xmath48 components , and we see that the @xmath47 term is about an order of magnitude larger over the whole range shown . as before , the fall - off at the left is a consequence of the chosen minimum @xmath37 .",
    "since the incoming quark is typically at large @xmath1 , where its distribution is already known fairly accurately @xcite , photon - jet production provides a direct measurement of the gluon density for small @xmath1 in the range @xmath49 .    to illustrate the accuracy that can be achieved in a determination of the gluon density , we show in fig .",
    "[ xg ] the cteq3 m gluon momentum density @xmath50 together with the statistical errors on measurements that correspond to the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ pjptx1 ] .",
    "notice that there is sufficient precision not merely to measure the gluon density but also to test its evolution .",
    "the cross sections presented here are , of course , the result of an extrapolation of parton densities from a region where they have been measured to much smaller @xmath1 values .",
    "we next consider lepton pair production from hadrons ( the drell - yan process ) .",
    "using the same kinematic region defined by expression ( [ xregions ] ) , we obtain the next - to - leading order cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ dyxm ] .",
    "again , the relatively large cross sections lead to a large number of events expected at the lhc . more significantly , by measuring cross sections at smaller values of the pair mass @xmath51",
    ", we can obtain parton densities at lower values of @xmath1 than in the other processes considered in this paper .",
    "the advantage of the drell - yan process is that one can go to fairly small @xmath51 values while still trusting the pqcd formalism",
    ".    the dominant contribution for this process comes from the @xmath52 channel ; the @xmath53 contributions are about 30 times smaller than those from @xmath54 . using quark distributions @xmath55 which are well - determined for large @xmath56 , one",
    "may then extract antiquark densities @xmath57 at small @xmath1 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ uq ] a plot of the extrapolated cteq3 m antiquark density @xmath58 with the statistical errors based on the cross sections shown in fig .  [ dyxm ]",
    ". note that we consider the drell - yan process down to relatively small pair masses @xmath59 .",
    "this assumes that , in the experiment , the detector will be able to suppress the background due to heavy flavor decays .",
    "such suppression might be achieved using information from the forward calorimeters as well as from microvertex detectors .",
    "we next consider the cross section for the production of dijets .",
    "[ jjptx1 ] shows the cross section in bins of @xmath33 and @xmath1 , in the region defined by expression ( [ xregions ] ) .",
    "the cross sections obtained are about 100 times larger than all the others computed in this paper .    in fig .",
    "[ jjx1 ] , we show the @xmath1 distribution of the cross section . aside from the total cross section ( solid curve )",
    ", we also exhibit the contributions from the different partonic channels : @xmath60 ( dashed ) , @xmath47 ( upper dotted ) , @xmath61 ( lower dotted ) and @xmath54 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "the largest contributions to the cross section come from the @xmath60 and @xmath47 channels .",
    "this process thus provides an independent consistency check of the parton distributions , primarily the gluon density , obtained from other processes .",
    "production of @xmath62-bosons in the forward direction provides a complementary way to measure sea quark distributions at small @xmath1 . at the same time ,",
    "comparison of the rates of production of @xmath63 and @xmath64 bosons would provide a new method to measure the ratio @xmath65 at large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "( such a measurement would rely on the presumed equality of @xmath66 and @xmath67 distributions at small @xmath1 . )",
    "current determinations of @xmath68 rely on data from deuterium targets , where nuclear effects can be large for @xmath69 . notice that most of the current global fits , eg .",
    "@xcite , assume that @xmath70 when @xmath71 , whereas a perturbative qcd analysis of the leading diagrams for the @xmath71 limit @xcite suggests that @xmath72 in this limit .",
    "a direct measurement independent of any data requiring knowledge of nuclear effects would be valuable .    at next - to - leading order",
    ", we calculate the cross sections for @xmath73 and @xmath74 production in bins of @xmath1 .",
    "one observes from fig .",
    "[ wvx ] that significant rates can be measured up to @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that quark distributions at @xmath76 can be measured from the sum of the cross sections for production of @xmath73 and @xmath74-bosons down to @xmath77 . at the same time",
    ", one would be able to distinguish between different scenarios for the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath68 ratio in the @xmath78 limit .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ cqptx1 ] and [ cqx1 ] the @xmath79 and @xmath1 distributions , respectively , for charm quark production in the region defined by expression ( [ xregions ] ) .",
    "the same general features as in the plots for jet plus photon and dijets are observed .    in fig .",
    "[ cqx1 ] , the contributions from the two active partonic channels are also shown : @xmath60 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath54 ( dot - dashed curve ) . the total cross section is of order 1 to @xmath80 pb when @xmath81 . in this region",
    ", the @xmath54 contribution dominates , being about 10 times larger than that of the @xmath60 channel",
    ". in the region @xmath82 , the total cross section rises , is of order @xmath83 pb and mostly consists of @xmath60 channel contributions ; the @xmath54 contribution drops to about 10% of the total .",
    "thus , it is possible to extract the antiquark ( or quark ) density at @xmath84 from the charm quark cross section providing a cross - check of the antiquark densities obtained from drell - yan measurements . in this case",
    ", the background consisting of @xmath60 channel contributions is well determined with the use of the gluon density obtained from the jet plus photon or dijet cross section as described in sections [ sec : pj ] and [ sec : twoj ] .",
    "similarly , it is also possible to extract the gluon density at @xmath85 from this type of cross section , providing a cross - check of gluon densities derived from other measurements .",
    "we have shown , in several independent ways , how parton distributions in nucleons and nuclei ( nuclear shadowing ) down to @xmath86 may be measured from hadron - hadron interactions at lhc energies .",
    "in particular , we show in figs .",
    "[ ptxqctr ] and [ ptxgctr ] the regions in energy @xmath87 and momentum fraction @xmath1 where measurements can be made for extracting antiquark and gluon densities , respectively , at better than 20% accuracy from the different hadronic processes considered , assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath88 .    in fig .",
    "[ ptxqctr ] , the region marked with cross - hatch shading shows where the drell - yan process determines the antiquark densities with better than 20% accuracy .",
    "the dashed horizontal line is where @xmath62 production determines these densities .",
    "the small triangle with horizontal shading shows where charm production determines the antiquark densities .",
    "the dotted curve shows the minimum value of @xmath1 as a function of the pair mass @xmath51 in the drell - yan process .",
    "similarly , we show in fig .",
    "[ ptxgctr ] the regions where data on the different processes can determine the gluon density .",
    "the regions marked with vertical , horizontal and slanted lines correspond to jet plus photon , charm quark and dijet production , respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed curve represents the minimum allowed value of @xmath1 as a function of the @xmath33 of the jet or heavy quark .    in our calculations",
    ", we have assumed that the usual dglap evolution equations apply to the parton densities in the very small @xmath1 region being considered and that cteq3 m parton distributions can be extrapolated outside the region in which they are valid .",
    "however , it may well be that other physics effects , notably gluon recombination @xcite , are important at these small @xmath1 values . as we have seen , by measuring parton densities over a wide range of scales and in several processes , one can , in fact , test whether dglap evolution and the rest of the factorization method is valid  see , for example , figs .",
    "[ xg ] and [ uq ] .",
    "of course , if the measurements fail consistency checks , for example if dglap evolution is found to fail , then one can no longer say that it is the parton densities that are being measured , but rather that one is probing new effects at small @xmath1 .",
