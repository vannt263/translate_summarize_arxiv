    "our universe started uniform and hot @xcite and became colder and clumpier as more and more structure formed @xcite .",
    "early on , radiation and later matter dominated the universe @xcite .",
    "as the universe expanded , the concentrations of matter and radiation decreased , and dark energy started to dominate the universe causing the accelerated expansion we observe today @xcite . at first",
    "this seems to violate the second law of thermodynamics , that entropy never decreases , because the hot and uniform early universe appears to have high entropy and the clumpy , cold universe of today has low entropy .",
    "however , since gravitational entropy increases with clumpiness , the total entropy increases and the second law of thermodynamics is not violated .",
    "three of the largest repositories of entropy in the current universe are gravitational : the cosmological event horizon , the supermassive black holes , and the cosmic gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "in time , the universe will become larger and emptier .",
    "the cosmological horizon absorbs entropy from the matter and radiation that stream through it , and grows in response .",
    "eventually , most matter and radiation will stream beyond the cosmological horizon leaving dark energy to completely dominate the universe on scales beyond @xmath0 mpc .",
    "however , the local supercluster is decoupled from the expansion of the universe and will remain gravitationally bound @xcite .",
    "imagine now that the local supercluster collapses to a single supermassive black hole of @xmath1 @xcite , which has a schwarzschild radius of @xmath2 light years and a hawking temperature of @xmath3 k @xcite .",
    "once the universe cools below this temperature , the black hole will start to evaporate .",
    "the cosmic microwave background cools beyond the black hole temperature in @xmath4 years and below the temperature of the cosmological horizon ( @xmath5 k ) in @xmath6 years . here",
    "@xmath7 is the areal radius of the cosmological horizon if the universe were empty de sitter .",
    "the timescales are close due to the exponential nature of the expansion of the universe during dark energy domination .",
    "the heat from the relatively hot black hole will then flow across the much colder cosmological horizon .",
    "this heat flow produces much more entropy than was lost by the black black hole @xcite @xmath8 .",
    "the total entropy of empty de sitter with a non - rotating black hole added at its center is@xcite @xmath9 , where @xmath7 is given by the cosmological constant @xmath10 or alternatively by the hubble constant @xmath11 .",
    "the total entropy @xmath12 increases as the mass of the black hole decreases due to the @xmath13 term , which is much larger than @xmath14 because @xmath15 .",
    "everything in the local universe is expected to either coalesce into supermassive black holes or be ejected @xcite .",
    "the supermassive black holes will then slowly evaporate due to hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the evaporation process clearly satisfies the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "heat flows from hot ( black hole ) to cold ( cosmological horizon ) and @xmath12 increases . since black hole evaporation is the dominant non - equilibrium process , black hole thermodynamics is the physics of the far future .",
    "operationally , minkowski space is indistinguishable from de sitter with the cosmological constant going to zero . in the @xmath16 limit of de sitter",
    ", temperature goes to zero and entropy diverges with the area of the cosmological horizon . in the literature , the entropy of flat space is sometimes taken to be zero @xcite because flat space has no horizon , although @xcite argues that the entropy is infinite . this confusion could arise due to the weyl curvature hypothesis @xcite , which states that the difference in entropy between the initial and final states of the universe is related to the growth of the overall weyl curvature",
    "however , the de sitter metric has zero weyl curvature but extremely large entropy , so there can not be a direct relation between weyl curvature and gravitational entropy .    we propose a more subtle relation between the weyl curvature and the gravitational entropy .",
    "the einstein equations determine the riemann curvature locally by the stress - energy tensor , but the weyl tensor is nearly free except for boundary conditions given by the bianchi identities .",
    "the modes of the weyl tensor can then act as the microstates of the gravitational field , and the entropy would from coarse - graining over states of the weyl tensor .",
    "the counting of allowed microstates would be influenced by the boundary conditions imposed by the local stress - energy .",
    "the cosmological horizon suppresses some long - wavelength modes of the weyl tensor , leading the entropy to be lower for a larger cosmological constant .",
    "likewise , the presence of a black hole or a star changes which modes are allowed and can depress the entropy .",
    "the equilibrium state of a gas in a box is a state of maximum entropy where the gas is uniformly distributed and featureless .",
    "the universe today clearly is not in gravitational equilibrium .",
    "the process of objects passing beyond the cosmological horizon , and of black holes evaporating , are the processes by which the universe is reaching equilibrium .",
    "empty de sitter space is maximally symmetric since it posses a full set of ten symmetries expressed by killing vectors ( one time and three space translations , three rotations , and three boosts ) .",
    "it is the space with maximum entropy of the spacetimes with fixed @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "flat space has the same symmetries , but does not have the preferred scale that @xmath17 provides .",
    "it therefore has even higher entropy than de sitter .",
    "when quantum effects are included de sitter may decay to flat space .",
    "alternatively , if the cosmological constant is mimicked by a scalar field , our universe could cascade through a series of configurations with increasing entropy and decreasing apparent dark energy density , and eventually reach flat space .",
    "all of these processes are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics , as entropy continually increases .",
    "a completely satisfactory theory of gravitational thermodynamics is very challenging because energy at a point can not be defined in general relativity due to the equivalence principle - going into free fall removes all local gravitational effects .",
    "one solution to this problem is quasilocal energy where one computes the energy inside a surface .",
    "the universal nature of gravitation means that the quasilocal energy counts all of the energy inside a surface , not just gravitational energy . as an example",
    ", we will derive formulas for entropy associated with a star using brown - york quasilocal quantities @xcite .",
    "we start with the usual expression of the first law of thermodynamics @xmath18 relating the change in internal energy @xmath19 to changes in the entropy @xmath20 and volume @xmath21 through the temperature @xmath22 and pressure @xmath23 .",
    "this law does not extend naturally to gravitating system because @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are extensive variables .",
    "when two subsystems are brought together , the extensive quantities should add .",
    "however , this does not work for unshielded long - range forces like gravitation . as two stars are brought together the gravitational binding energy deceases the total energy .",
    "but quasilocal energy is additive since when two regions share a common boundary the contributions to the two quasilocal integrals cancel .    similarly , gravitation curves space so the total volume depends in a nonlinear way on the overall mass distribution . for a surface enclosing a black hole , the volume inside is not really a sensible quantity .",
    "quasilocal quantities suggest a replacement for the @xmath24 term with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the surface pressure of @xcite , which is perhaps better thought of as a surface tension .",
    "we can stretch the quasilocal surface , but we suffer a change in energy proportional to the surface tension times the change in area .",
    "this is a much more natural quantity in curved space than a change in volume .    to demonstrate the use of these quantities",
    ", we consider a static , spherically - symmetric star with density @xmath27 and pressure @xmath28 .",
    "the metric is @xmath29 solving the einstein equation determines both @xmath30 and @xmath31 in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in what follows",
    ", we will also use the `` mass '' of the star , @xmath32 the constant @xmath33 allows for the possibility of a black hole rather than a star .",
    "the quasilocal energy is @xmath34 and the quasilocal surface tension is @xmath35 = \\frac{h(r)}{8 \\pi r^2 } \\big [ r - m(r ) + 4 \\pi r^3 p(r ) \\big ] ~.\\ ] ] the first law of thermodynamics becomes @xmath36 note that both @xmath37 and @xmath26 include a subtraction term , which sets the value of each to @xmath38 in flat space ( this is obtained by setting @xmath39 ) , but these cancel .",
    "we allow two kinds of virtual displacements - changes in the radius of the quasilocal surface and in the mass profile of the star .",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the curved space volume .",
    "the first term is zero when @xmath42 , so the entropy is constant outside the star even when there is a cosmological constant .",
    "however , inside the star , the entropy is not constant .",
    "the temperature of the cosmological horizon is @xmath43 .",
    "so if the total mass of the star is @xmath44 , then the entropy at the center of the star is less than that at the surface by an amount proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "we have pointed out that a simple problem like a star or black hole in de sitter space is far from equilibrium .",
    "any gravitational configuration other than de sitter space may be best treated as a non - equilibrium state .",
    "we suggest to replace the @xmath37 and @xmath46 terms with quasilocal quantities .",
    "a complete treatment of gravitational entropy involves dealing with the long - range and non - equilibrium nature of the gravitational field .",
    "the positive cosmological constant plays a large role in the thermodynamics of the gravitational field , and better understanding of its role will improve our understanding of the evolution of the universe and perhaps of cosmology as a whole .",
