    "the second layer @xmath2he on graphite is an ideal example for studying two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermion system . by controlling the number of adsorption atoms",
    ", we can widely change the areal density @xmath14 from nearly ideal fermi gas to highly compressed 2d solid @xcite . at the commensurate phase in the second layer ,",
    "so called  4/7 phase \" , a gap - less quantum spin liquid state is suggested .",
    "the transition between a fermi fluid and the 4/7 phase is mott - hubbard type with divergence of the effective mass @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent heat capacity study shows the existence of a low - density liquid state ( @xmath16 nm@xmath5 ) in the third layer @xcite .",
    "but , this self - condensed state has not been confirmed in the second layer yet . to study the spin correlation in the quantum spin liquid , the self - condensed liquid , and the relaxation process in the liquid or",
    "dilute fermi gas , pulsed - nmr is a useful probe .    in this work , we report a preliminary pulsed - nmr study of the spin - spin relaxation time ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath1 ) of fermi fluid phase in the second layer . to remove the large curie susceptibility from the first layer , we replaced the first layer @xmath2he with @xmath3he .",
    "it is also helpful to reduce the substrate heterogeneity effect because the heterogeneous regions with deep potential are preferentially filled with @xmath3he atoms .",
    "the substrate used in this work was grafoil , an exfoliated graphite , with the total surface area of @xmath17 m@xmath18 .",
    "grafoil consists of 10 - 20 nm size micro - crystallites with a mosaic angle spread of @xmath19 @xcite . before adding @xmath2he sample at 2.7 k ,",
    "11.78 nm@xmath5 of @xmath3he was adsorbed at 4.2 k as the first layer .",
    "this density is slightly higher than the highest density of the first layer @xmath2he determined from the neutron scattering ( 11.06 nm@xmath5 ) @xcite and the heat capacity measurement ( 11.4 nm@xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that @xmath2he atoms do nt sink into the first layer . the conventional spin - echo technique with the pulse sequence of @xmath20-@xmath21-@xmath22 were used for measuring the spin - spin relaxation time @xmath0 . in presence of the mosaic angle spread of grafoil ,",
    "the decay of the spin - echo signal shows about 5% of long tail component due to the angular dependence of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "but , in this work , spin - echo measurements were carried out within @xmath23 where the contribution of the long tail is not important , and @xmath0 was obtained by single exponential fitting .",
    "most of the experiments , except a larmor frequency dependence of @xmath0 , were carried out in a larmor frequency of 5.5 mhz ( @xmath24 mt ) .",
    "the static magnetic field is parallel to the substrate .",
    "the details of this set - up are described in earlier paper , where grafoil is replaced with zyx @xcite .",

    "the solid curves are fitting lines by eq.([eqn1 ] ) . *",
    "b. * density dependence of the susceptibility at @xmath26 .",
    "the closed circles are the data taken in this work , while the open circles are those in ref.@xcite . *",

    "figure 1(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 at @xmath2he density range of @xmath4 nm@xmath5 .",
    "the signals are well described by the phenomenological expression for the susceptibility of a fermi liquid @xcite : @xmath28 down to @xmath8 nm@xmath5 , which is about half of the lowest density in the earlier study @xcite .",
    "now , @xmath29 is the curie constant and @xmath27 is the effective fermi temperature . at @xmath11 nm@xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath1 increases slightly at lowest temperature @xmath30 mk . considering a small amount of paramagnetic solid @xmath2he",
    ", this fraction corresponds to within 2% of the total @xmath2he atoms in experimental accuracy .",
    "we thought that this is trapped @xmath2he atoms in substrate heterogeneities , and it can be removed by introducing a few percent of excess @xmath3he",
    "atoms @xcite .    in landau fermi liquid theory ,",
    "the @xmath26 susceptibility of 2d fermi liquid is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a landau parameter and @xmath33 is the fermi temperature .",
    "since @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath34 , number of @xmath2he atoms , and @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the surface area over which the @xmath2he liquid occupies , we obtain @xmath37 . considering the self - condensation",
    ", @xmath36 would be smaller than the total surface area ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "now , because the @xmath26 susceptibility of an ideal 2d fermi gas is @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath2he atoms are uniformly spread over the surface area ( @xmath41 ) , this function approaches to a constant value ( in ideal gas case , unity ) at dilute limit .",
    "on the other hand , when self - condensation occurs , @xmath36 changes linearly with increasing @xmath34 , resulting in @xmath42 similarly to the density dependence of @xmath43 in heat capacity measurement of the third layer @xcite .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows obtained @xmath44 against @xmath14 .",
    "the value approaches to unity with decreasing @xmath14 , and there is no anomaly down to @xmath8 nm@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence of self - condensation at least at the density above 0.68 nm@xmath5 in the second layer .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath0 at @xmath45 mk and @xmath9 mhz is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it shows a broad maximum of 5.7 ms around @xmath10 nm@xmath5 . at high density side ,",
    "the particle motion is suppressed by the divergence of @xmath15 toward a mott localization @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath14 due to the suppression of motional narrowing . at the lowest density @xmath8 nm@xmath5 ,",
    "the scattering radius @xmath46 is much shorter than a mean free path @xmath47 , and a dilute 2d @xmath2he gas model is applicable . from an analogous approach to a dilute bulk @xmath2he gas @xcite , we obtain : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is magnetic moment of @xmath2he , and the averaged velocity @xmath50 at fermi degenerated gas ( @xmath51 from figure 1(c ) ) . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath0 increases with decreasing @xmath14 by @xmath52 at dilute limit . on the other hand , obtained @xmath0 decreases at @xmath8 nm@xmath5 .",
    "it indicates that there is another relaxation process that becomes important at dilute limit .",
    "cowan and kent measured @xmath0 of very low density @xmath2he films on bare graphite @xcite , and showed that a small amount of @xmath2he ( @xmath53 few percent of monolayer ) would form high - density solid with @xmath54 ms in heterogeneous region of the substrate . by atomic exchanges between this solid and the 2d gas , relaxation in the heterogeneous region dominates the relaxation process of the 2d gas .",
    "the linear @xmath14-dependence of @xmath0 in the `` first layer '' is also shown in the same graph ( fig.[fig2 ] ) for the reference . because the adsorption potential in the second layer is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of the first layer , it is unrealistic to consider such a high - density solid .",
    "however , since the heterogeneous region can exist as a relaxation spot , and very small amount of @xmath2he could also exist as a solid .",
    "this is consistent with the increase of @xmath6 at lowest temperature .",
    "magnetic impurity in substrate may be another causation of the relaxation .",
    "larmor frequency dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the closed circles are @xmath0 of the second layer fermi fluid at @xmath11 nm@xmath5 and @xmath45 mk .",
    "the open circles are those of the first layer solid at a coverage of 0.76 monolayer and @xmath55 k @xcite . the solid lines are linear fitting to the data . ]",
    "larmor frequency dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the closed circles are @xmath0 of the second layer fermi fluid at @xmath11 nm@xmath5 and @xmath45 mk .",
    "the open circles are those of the first layer solid at a coverage of 0.76 monolayer and @xmath55 k @xcite .",
    "the solid lines are linear fitting to the data . ]    in figure 3 , we show the larmor frequency dependence of @xmath0 in a high - density fermi fluid ( @xmath11 nm@xmath5 ) at @xmath45 mk ( closed circles ) .",
    "we observed a linear relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this characteristic linear dependence of @xmath0 is also observed in a first layer solid @xmath2he @xcite ( open circles ) .",
    "it is curious since @xmath0 should be independent of @xmath13 as long as @xmath56 , where @xmath21 ( @xmath57 sec ) is the correlation time .",
    "although the explanation for this linearity is not satisfactory established , this could be a microscopic magnetic field inhomogeneity effect caused by the mosaic angle spread and diamagnetism of the graphite substrate .",
    "assuming that the frequency dependence is an extrinsic effect related to the diffusion process in the microscopic magnetic field gradient , the intrinsic @xmath0 is obtained by extrapolating to @xmath58 where the diamagnetic field of graphite disappears .",
    "namely , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the intrinsic @xmath0 of the system . from the extrapolation ,",
    "@xmath60 at @xmath11 nm@xmath5 is very long ( @xmath61 s ) although the strict value is not available because @xmath62-intercept is too small .",
    "this is much longer than that of the first layer solid ( @xmath63 ms ) .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath64 , which is a slope of @xmath12 , is almost the same between these two samples .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the @xmath13-dependence of @xmath0 is extrinsic one . to obtain the strict value of @xmath60 , lower frequency experiment or a substrate with larger platelet size and smaller mosaic angle will be required .    in conclusion , we measured @xmath6 and @xmath0 of the second layer @xmath2he at the density region of @xmath4 nm@xmath5 on graphite pleplated with a monolayer @xmath3he .",
    "obtained @xmath6 shows fermi fluid behaviour at all densities , and there is no self - condensed state down to @xmath8 nm@xmath5 .",
    "density dependence of @xmath0 at @xmath9 mhz shows a broad maximum of 5.7 msec .",
    "the decrease of @xmath0 at @xmath8 nm@xmath5 could be related to the @xmath2he solid at the heterogeneity in the substrate .",
    "we also observed a @xmath13-linear dependence of @xmath12 , which is similar to that in the earlier study for the first layer solid @xcite .",
    "this @xmath13-dependence of @xmath0 is an extrinsic effect , and the intrinsic @xmath0 in the fermi fluid is much longer than measured value .",
