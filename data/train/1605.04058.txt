    "<S> the degeneracy of @xmath10 and @xmath11 electronic states is completely lifted by the breaking of both the symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry dependence of energy dispersion should be common to other elementary excitations in solids such as photon , magnon , phonon , etc . </S>",

    "<S> the natural optical activity and faraday rotation are corresponding to the spin splitting in sis - broken and trs - broken electronic systems , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> recently , nonreciprocal directional dichroism in the systems without trs and sis has been investigated extensively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is caused by the difference between the reflective indexes for + _ k _ and -_k _ photons irrespective of the polarization direction , which originates from the photonic energy dispersion asymmetry in trs - broken and sis - broken systems . </S>",
    "<S> quite recently , similar nonreciprocal propagation of magnons has been observed in sis - broken ferromagnetic films @xcite and chiral ferromagnets @xcite originating from dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction . </S>",
    "<S> here , we study the nonreciprocal propagation of phonon , more specifically , the surface acoustic wave in sis- and trs - broken hybrid devices .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface acoustic wave ( saw ) is the acoustic wave propagating on surface ( rayleigh wave ) . </S>",

    "<S> the saw can be efficiently excited and detected by the electromagnetic wave on piezoelectric materials such as linbo@xmath0 with use of interdigital transducers ( idts ) @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we show the saw propagation is certainly nonreciprocal for one of the device . based on the device - dependence </S>",

    "<S> the excitation frequencies are 2.2335 ghz for device a and 2.2350 ghz for device b. there exists some direct electromagnetic crosstalk between idts in addition to the coupling via saw propagation . in order to separate the saw signal from electromagnetic crosstalk </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a time domain measurement using pulsed microwave . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1(d ) and 1(e ) display demodulated microwave input and output signals through the saw device . using a large difference in group velocity between saw and electromagnetic wave ( emw ) , we successfully separate them in time - domain . </S>",

    "<S> the presented data are average of those taken by field increasing measurement and field decreasing measurement . with decreasing magnetic field from + 400 mt , </S>",
    "<S> the absorption increases largely . </S>",
    "<S> it shows a maximum accompanying a small dip structure around zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> then , the absorption decreases again toward high negative magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the enhancement of the absorption , the phase velocity decreases in the low magnetic field region . </S>",
    "<S> around the zero magnetic field , it shows a sharp peak corresponding to the dip structure of the absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization reversal process is restricted to the low field region below 30 mt as shown in supplemental material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dip structure of absorption and sharp peak of phase velocity are caused by the magnetization reversal process . on the other hand , the magnetic field dependences in the higher magnetic field region </S>",
    "<S> are induced by the change of difference in frequency between saw and ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the saw frequency does not show magnetic field dependence , the fmr frequency increases linearly with the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we certainly observe fmr around 2 ghz at zero magnetic field and its frequency increases with magnetic field for a similar ni film ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference tunes the magnetoelastic coupling , which is reflected by the absorption of saw .    </S>",

    "<S> correspondingly , the phase velocity also shows the asymmetric field dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetries can not be ascribed to the magnetization process because the magnetic moment saturates above 30 mt . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the asymmetries should be caused by the intrinsic difference of saw propagation between positive and negative magnetic fields , denoted as nonreciprocal saw propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the saw absorption @xmath18 for wave vector @xmath19 at magnetic field @xmath20 satisfies the relation @xmath21 . to check this relation , we observe the increase of absorption and the decrease of phase velocity for saw with opposite wave vector ( figs . </S>",

    "<S> the nonreciprocity also shows a large angle dependence . </S>",
    "<S> while the nonreciprocity is negligible at @xmath23 , the absorption at @xmath26 clearly shows the nonreciprocal behavior . the nonrciprocity decreases with increasing @xmath16 from @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> while the absorption at @xmath23 and 90@xmath29 is quite small , the large absorption is observed at 30@xmath1 , 45@xmath1 and 60@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption is suppressed above 100 mt . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression field is smaller than that of device a. the difference may originate from the difference of shape anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot the angle dependence of the saw absorption at 40 mt in fig . </S>",

    "<S> let us theoretically discuss the saw excitation of fmr . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order of magnetoelastic coupling energy is @xcite @xmath31    here , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are magnetoelastic coupling constants for cubic symmetry and @xmath34 is @xmath35 component of strain tensor . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 oscillate upon the saw propagating along _ x_-axis as followings @xcite ; @xmath39 @xmath40 is saw frequency , and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are real and decrease exponentially along _ z _ direction . here </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the device plane is perpendicular to _ z_-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the phases of longitudinal strains @xmath36 , @xmath37 and shear strain @xmath38 are different by @xmath43/2 forming the ellipsoidal polarization of elastic oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath19 is reversed , the ellipsoidal direction becomes reversed and the @xmath42 shows different sign . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume the static magnetization is parallel to the device plane as followings ; @xmath44 then the effective magnetic field induced by saw propagating along _ </S>",
    "<S> x_-axis is @xmath45 only the ac magnetic field perpendicular to the magnetization @xmath46 can excite fmr . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane and out - of - plane components of @xmath46 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the susceptibility of fmr for right - handed circular polarized field @xmath49 is large while that for left - handed field @xmath50 is negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saw absorption induced by magnetoelastic fmr is proportional to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility for right - handed circular polarized field . as mentioned above , the saw absorption for device a is roughly proportional to @xmath25 , while that for device b to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> these indicate that @xmath33 ( @xmath32 ) contribution to the magnetoelastic excitation is dominant for device a ( device b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference may originate from the shape dependent magnetoelastic coupling but at present we could not specify the microscopic mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of nonreciprocity between devices a and b is also ascribed to the different magnitude of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . when the wave vector of saw is reversed , the circular direction of elastic wave polarization is reversed , which is reflected by the sign of @xmath42 . therefore the nonreciprocity can be induced by the interference of @xmath32 and @xmath33 terms in eq . </S>",
