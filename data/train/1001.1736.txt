    "numerous observational studies have demonstrated that large - scale stellar bars are remarkably common amongst local disk galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and that a substantial population of barred disks exists out to at least redshift unity ( e.g.  @xcite ) . quantifying the fraction of barred disks as a function of redshift , and its dependence on fundamental galaxy properties , is an essential step towards understanding galaxy formation in a cosmological context .",
    "importantly , large - scale bars serve as signposts of massive , dynamically - cold disks @xcite , constraining their epoch of formation @xcite .",
    "moreover , bars are key drivers of secular evolution in their host galaxies , redistributing angular momentum , enhancing nuclear star formation , and building pseudobulges ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a number of recent studies have examined the disk galaxy bar fraction for luminosity - selected samples at intermediate - to - high redshifts in the field ( e.g.  @xcite ) , in clusters @xcite , or both @xcite .",
    "@xcite recovered a constant bar fraction out to redshift unity in the gems survey for disk galaxies at @xmath9 and @xmath1020.6 mag .",
    "conversely , for galaxies at @xmath11 ( @xmath12 mag at @xmath13 ) and brighter in the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos ) , @xcite identified a build up of the barred population over the same epoch . @xcite and @xcite have identified a minimal dependence of the bar fraction on environment ( see also @xcite ) , except perhaps in cluster centres , where bar formation appears to be enhanced .",
    "both studies also recovered a rise in the bar fraction towards later morphological types , or bluer , increasingly disk - dominated systems , while @xcite recovered an enhanced bar fraction in redder , increasingly bulge - dominated systems at high redshifts .",
    "however , care must be taken when comparing these results due to the different luminosity limits adopted ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite sampled faint disks down to @xmath14 mag at @xmath15 , and @xmath16 mag at @xmath17 , respectively ) .",
    "interestingly , the highest bar fraction found by @xcite was 75@xmath1811% for clumpy disks with distinct bulges at high luminosities ( @xmath19 mag ) .",
    "a further complication is introduced by the various methods of disk selection employed , whether sed - fit type and visual inspection @xcite , visual inspection alone @xcite , or colour , global srsic index , and visual inspection @xcite .    in the light of recent evidence that galaxy evolutionary histories are tied closely to total stellar mass @xcite , the further study of evolution in mass - limited samples is a crucial step forward to undertake . in this letter",
    "we quantify the bar fraction at intermediate - to - high redshifts , at fixed stellar mass , using a sample of 916 morphologically - classified disk galaxies in the cosmos field . specifically , we study the dependence of the ( large - scale ) bar fraction on detailed morphological type ( early- or late - type disks ) , specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) , and large - scale environmental density .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows . in section [ dataset ]",
    "we review the cosmos dataset employed in this work , and describe our sample selection . in section [ method ]",
    "we explain our bar detection procedure and method of accounting for selection biases . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results , and in section [ discussion ] we discuss their implications for galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "the construction and bar fraction analysis of a complementary sample of local universe disk galaxies in the sdss is described in the appendix .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system throughout .",
    "we use the cosmos dataset @xcite , consisting of ground - based and space - based , multi - wavelength imaging of an @xmath42 deg@xmath23 equatorial field . in particular , as the starting point for our sample definition , we adopt the @xmath24-band source catalogue of @xcite extracted from the cosmos acs @xmath24-band imaging frames @xcite , consisting of 156,748 sources limited down to @xmath25 mag . careful artifact and star removal",
    "was performed to improve the robustness of this catalogue , and computation of photometric redshifts was attempted for 111,141 of these sources flagged as galaxies ( i.e. , removing stars and junk ) .",
    "eleven photometric bands covering the wavelength range between the cosmos cfht @xmath26 and the spitzer @xmath27 @xmath28 band ( see @xcite ) were used to derive these photometric redshifts using our own _ zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer _ ( zebra ) code @xcite . to this end , we used galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos survey @xcite and modified with zebra our set of empirical templates @xcite to account for systematic , template - dependent mismatches with the photometric spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the sample galaxies .",
    "an acceptable template match was able to be identified for all but 1695 of the 111,141 input sources ( a 1.5% failure rate ) .",
    "the resulting photometric redshifts have an uncertainty of @xmath29 down to @xmath30 mag , as directly tested with available spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos .",
    "we estimated the photometric redshift accuracy at magnitudes fainter than @xmath31 mag by dimming the photometry of zcosmos galaxies down to @xmath32 mag ; this results in an uncertainty of @xmath33 .",
    "as a cross - check , we also used the photometric redshifts of @xcite , which became available in the meantime .",
    "these are based on a photometric catalog of the cosmos survey with 30 photometric bands including also narrow- and intermediate - band filters , and the effects of both dust extinction and emission lines on template fitting were accounted for carefully during their computation .",
    "based on the comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts of the @xmath30 mag zcosmos sample , the dispersion of the @xcite photo-@xmath34 catalog is @xmath4@xmath35 ( and @xmath4@xmath36 down to @xmath32 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the use of a much larger number of photometric passbands , the @xcite redshifts have a higher accuracy than our zebra estimates .",
    "the advantage of the latter , however , is that they were derived by ourselves , and we are thus fully aware of their caveats and limitations . we therefore take the conservative strategy to use both versions of the cosmos photo-@xmath34s in our analysis , as a means to identify any systematic uncertainty associated with the photometric redshift estimates .    in order to estimate stellar masses from the photometric data , we used a",
    "newly - developed , non - public extension of our zebra code , zebra+ , which estimates galaxy physical parameters , such as stellar masses , by fitting synthetic stellar population model seds to the galaxy broadband photometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as in zebra s maximum likelihood mode ,",
    "the best fit sed and its normalisation , are computed by minimising the @xmath37 between the observed and template fluxes .",
    "additionally , zebra+ includes reddening of the input seds with a variety of dust laws , when required . using the zcosmos 10k sample @xcite have demonstrated a level of uncertainty of @xmath38 arising from the choices of sed template and dust extinction law for stellar masses derived via sed - fitting to the cosmos photometric data .",
    "this is consistent with the scatter of @xmath39 between our zebra+ stellar mass estimates and those from the publicly - available catalog of @xcite for galaxies well - matched in both position ( centroid difference less than @xmath40 arcsec ) and photometric redshift ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "details for zebra+ , including a further investigation into the relevant uncertainties , are given in oesch et al .",

    "an acceptable synthetic template match for computation of stellar masses was able to be identified for all but 7033 of the 109,446 galaxies with estimated photometric redshifts ( a 6% failure rate ) .",
    "we stress that our results remain unchanged when using either of the two photo-@xmath34 catalogs ; furthermore , the resulting uncertainties in the stellar mass and star formation rate estimates are negligible . a total of 32,840 galaxies were identified with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath1 examined in this study , of which 3519 are above the adopted mass limit of @xmath42 @xmath3 .",

    "galaxy morphologies were obtained with an upgraded version of the _ zurich estimator of structural types _ ( zest ; @xcite ) , known as zest+ ( carollo et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) .",
    "relative to its predecessor , zest+ includes additional measurements of non - parametric morphological indices for characterising both structure and substructure .",
    "moreover , zest+ offers a support vector machine ( svm ) classification ( adopted herein ) , as well as a principal component analysis ( pca ) scheme for consistency with the earlier zest .",
    "the zest+ svm classifies galaxies in seven morphological types located in specific regions of the 6-dimensional space of concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness , m@xmath52 , gini coefficient , and ellipticity .",
    "the different types were visually inspected to ensure a broad equivalence with the following hubble types : e , s0-sa , sb , sc , sd , and irr ( with the irr types divided into two classes , ` concentrated ' and ` non - concentrated ' , according to the value of the concentration index ) . as a result of visual inspection of the 3519 galaxies in our sample at @xmath53 and @xmath42 @xmath3 , a total of 36 irr , 14 s0-sa , and 33 spiral ( sa - sb to sc - sd ) systems were identified as ` catastrophic ' misclassifications and were manually reassigned to their respective types .",
    "the two most frequent causes of such ` catastropic ' misclassifications were the presence of bright , overlapping neighbours and/or strong dust lanes ( see @xcite for a detailed study of the impact of dust on disks in cosmos ) , which can bias recovery of the quantitative morphological indices used as input to the svm analysis module . regarding the reliability of zest+ output in general , calibrations performed by @xcite using the original zest code to classify real cosmos galaxies show that down to @xmath54 mag the misclassification rate is at most @xmath430% for ellipticals incorrectly identified as early- and intermediate - type disks in the lowest s / n bin .",
    "as zest+ features substantially improved algorithms for computation of the relevant quantitative morphological indices relative to the original zest , we are confident that the zest+ morphological classifications are even more reliable than those of zest .",
    "the end result of our classification process was a final sample of 2820 disk galaxies ( morphological type between s0-sa and sc - sd ) , of which 916 have ellipticities ( @xmath55 ) less than 0.3 ( equivalent to disk inclination less than 45 deg ) .",

    "[ postage ] .",
    "barred galaxies in our sample were identified as follows .",
    "first , the ` ellipse ` package in ` iraf ` was used to recover the elliptical isophote profile of each galaxy from its acs @xmath24-band image . specifically ,",
    "` ellipse ` was run repeatedly for each galaxy , varying the initial guesses of object position , semi - major axis , ellipticity , and position angle until a robust fit was recovered down to the level of sky noise ( cf .",
    "if a robust fit could not be identified with a single combination of initial parameter guesses ( @xmath565% of cases ) , the profile was constructed piece - wise from the robust sections of two or more fitting attempts .",
    "pixels within 2.5 times the kron radius of any nearby neighbours were excluded from the fitting process .    all galaxies with profiles displaying a monotonic increase in ellipticity of @xmath57 with a subsequent drop of at least @xmath58",
    "were flagged as candidate barred systems .",
    "the threshold of @xmath59 was chosen to replicate the selection of strong galaxy bars made by @xcite and @xcite . however , unlike these other studies , we did not reject candidate barred systems based on a further criterion of isophote position angle change at the bar end .",
    "rather , the final selection of barred galaxies was performed via visual inspection of the candidates , thereby maximising the completeness of our bar sample ( i.e. , allowing for detection of those galaxies in which , by chance , the uncorrelated bar and disk position angles are closely aligned ; cf .",

    "( 67% ) of our 320 candidate barred systems ( 23% of the entire disk galaxy sample ) were thereby confirmed as barred .",
    "a further 23 barred candidates that were ultimately rejected were noted as ` ambiguous ' cases ( e.g.  the ` bar ' morphology was perhaps more consistent with that of a lens or truncated inner disk ) .",

    "completeness limits on bar detection given the isophotal ellipticity criteria described above were estimated via artificial galaxy simulations .",
    "both early - type and late - type barred galaxy models were constructed from three components : a srsic bulge , a ( truncated ) srsic bar , and an exponential disk . the properties of each model were chosen to be consistent with the observed properties of barred galaxies in the local universe @xcite , and are listed in table [ modelstats ] .",
    "the use of three different early type models was necessary to replicate the variety of structural types observed amongst local s0 and sa systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the models adopted span a wide range of bulge srsic indices ( @xmath60 ) and bulge - to - total flux ratios ( @xmath61 ) , and thus encompass the entire parameter space observed for massive local disk galaxies .    for all models",
    "we adopt a bar ellipticity of @xmath62 as this represents a lower limit on the intrinsic bar ellipticities typically recovered for massive disk galaxies in 2d bulge - bar - disk structural decomposition studies ( e.g. gadotti 2008 , mnras ) .",
    "the lower the intrinsic ellipticity of the bar , the lower the mean surface brightness ( at a given bar / t ) , so it follows that that low ellipticity bars will be most sensitive to surface brightness - dependent detection biases .",
    "moreover , the lower the intrinsic bar ellipticity , the more sensitive will the system be to size - dependent detection biases caused by the ` rounding ' of bar isophotes by the psf .",
