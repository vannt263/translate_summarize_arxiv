    "quantitative understanding of confinement and more generally of the dynamics of gluons at low energies remains as the major challenge in qcd . in the past few years lattice simulations and phenomenological studies",
    "have provided new insights into the nature of the low energy behavior of the gluon propagator and role of gluons in forming the hadronic spectrum  @xcite .",
    "since gluons can only participate in strong interactions , spectroscopy of hadrons with excited gluonic modes is of crucial importance for investigations of confinement .",
    "it has recently been shown that hybrid mesons with excited quark and gluon modes should have properties similar to that of ordinary hadronic resonances and thus gluonic excitations may appear in the meson spectrum  @xcite .",
    "searches for exotic mesons have produced a few tantalizing candidates  @xcite and new experiments planed for jlab and gsi in light and charm meson spectroscopy , respectively , are expected to produce a map of gluonic excitations . in this paper we address gluon propagation in the qcd vacuum .",
    "this investigation was prompted by recent lattice results indicating that in both covariant and coulomb gauges the low momentum gluons do not propagate  @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what one expects for physical degrees of freedom _",
    "e.g. _ two transverse gluons in a physical gauge  @xcite . in the four - dimensional euclidean formulation of covariant gauge qcd",
    ", however , the lack of ir enhancement in the gluon propagator contradicts the naive expectation that the color confining force could be simply related to the gluon propagator . a popular , phenomenological approach to gluon ( and quark ) low energy dynamics is based on a truncation of the self - consistent set of dyson - schwinger equations . in many such approaches",
    "the gluon propagator plays a central role in providing the effective interaction between quarks , for example , it is used to generate dynamical chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "a soft gluon propagator implies that confinement has to be described by other means .",
    "for example it has been argued that in covariant gauges the kugo - ojima confinement criterion for absence of colored non - singlets in the physical spectrum can be satisfied with a soft gluon propagator and an enhanced ghost propagator  @xcite .",
    "we will show that this also seems to be the case in coulomb gauge formulation .    in a covariant formulation one sacrifices positivity constraints and the fock space representation and introduces additional ( ghost ) non - physical degrees of freedom .",
    "alternatively , by relaxing the requirement of manifest lorentz covariance it is possible to eliminate all non - physical components and study confinement and other low energy phenomena within the framework of quantum mechanical wave functions .",
    "such an approach has obvious , important implications for quark model based phenomenology .",
    "furthermore , at finite density it allows for well established , diagrammatic , many - body techniques to be used .",
    "a many - body approach has proven to be successful in treating a variety of low energy phenomena in qcd .",
    "for example the random phase approximation , which is typically ( _ e.g. _ for electron gas ) relevant at high - densities , in qcd is also applicable at low - densities and may result in a self - consistent realization of confinement  @xcite . due to the long - range nature of the confining interaction , at low - densities quasiparticle excitations have infinite energy which eliminates colored states from the physical spectrum . due to the presence of bare quark - antiquark pairs near the fermi - dirac surface",
    ", the quasiparticle vacuum breaks chiral symmetry and leads to a non - vanishing scalar quark density .",
    "the collective excitations of this quark - antiquark plasma correspond to the goldstone bosons  @xcite .",
    "the picture described above relies on the existence of a long range , confined quark - quark interaction .",
    "such an interaction is expected to arise from the coulomb operator which in the coulomb gauge hamiltonian describes direct interactions between ( color ) charge densities . unlike qed , where this interaction is simply determined by the distance between sources , in qcd",
    "it is a complicated function of the transverse gluon field and can not be thought of as a simple potential _ i.e. _ of the cornell type  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture that the coulomb operator is related to the confining interaction is based on the observation that it is positive definite and vanishes at the gribov horizon .",
    "the grivbov horizon defines the boundary of the gluon field domain .",
    "a number of approximations have been developed to calculate the expectation value of the coulomb operator and to verify this conjecture  @xcite . in the process",
    "it has been realized that the gribov region still contains physically equivalent field configurations .",
    "to what extent the necessary identification of the wave functional at these gauge - equivalent points modifies the expectation value of the coulomb operator remains an open issue  @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to a many body system is to introduce a physicaly motivated ansatz for the wave functional and to define approximations for the evaluation of expectation values .",
    "we have followed this approach in ref .",
    "@xcite where we generated the confining interaction but a specific assumption on the behavior of the gluon propagator at low energies had to be imposed .",
    "in particular , the gluon dispersion relation which follows from minimizing the vacuum expectation value was solved self - consistently together with the confining interaction but a particular boundary condition was chosen for the solutions . in absence of the faddeev - popov determinant",
    "this was necessary in order to obtain a nontrivial solution to the coupled integral equations . in this paper",
    "we will show how the faddeev - popov determinant can be included , how it fixes the low energy gluon dispersion relation and brings it in a qualitative agreement with lattice results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we give a brief description of qcd in the coulomb gauge . as discussed above the main novel feature of this approach",
    "is the inclusion of the faddeev - popov determinant .",

    "as long as gauge fields are within the gribov region , @xmath34 , the coulomb potential is positive and it is possible to use a variational approach .",
    "the simplest variational ansatz for which diagrammatic expansion is possible is given by the functional generalization of the harmonic oscillator ground state which is equivalent to the quasiparticle approximation .",
