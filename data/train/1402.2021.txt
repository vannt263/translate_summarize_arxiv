    "<S> ( [ tg_0 ] ) fits all the glass transition temperatures nicely , even at low densities ( especially for wca systems ) where density scaling stops working @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ tg_0 ] ) condenses the major findings of our work . </S>",
    "<S> it explains why supercooled lj and wca liquids exhibit distinct dynamics from the @xmath0 glass perspective : vibrational properties including the boson peak frequency and low - frequency quasi - localization are distinct , which intrinsically originate from structural differences . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ tg_0 ] ) thus makes a direct quantitative connection between the glass transition and @xmath0 glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tg_0 ] ) does not require any information of particle interaction , so eq .  ( [ tg_0 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> may be generalized to other systems not showing any density scaling at all , which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the crossover density @xmath1 is too high to be realized in experiments at present @xcite , the physical pictures that it brings about deserve more discussions . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have made an interesting point that potential between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 of lj liquids can be approximated into an inverse power law @xmath101 with @xmath102 a constant varying with @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on this assumption , @xmath103 and relaxation times of lj liquids can collapse in terms of @xmath104 , which work well at @xmath105 with @xmath106 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> s7 and s8 of the sm and discussed in @xcite , @xmath107 in fact varies with @xmath2 , so @xmath106 is an approximation , only working at @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath91 , our study indicates that @xmath108 is the correct density scaling exponent , which arises from dimensional analysis and scaling relations of the @xmath0 glasses and can not be predicted by the inverse power - law potential approximation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s7 of the sm shows that the @xmath0 lj and wca glasses have different values of @xmath107 , so the inverse power - law potential approximation can not be simply applied to predict the existence of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> more details can be found in the sm .    as suggested by a recent study @xcite , the first coordination shell of lennard - jonesian liquids is enough to give correct physics . </S>",
    "<S> one may expect that the first coordination shell is inside the repulsive part of the interaction when @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is not exactly the case . at @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the first minima of @xmath72 of both lj and wca glasses are still beyond the potential minimum at @xmath109 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s9 of the sm ] . at densities higher than @xmath110 , it is true that the first minimum of @xmath72 lies within the repulsive part of the interaction . in that regime , </S>",
    "<S> behaviors of lj systems are determined by the repulsive part of the potential , and to distinguish attractive and repulsive inter - particle potentials is not meaningful any more @xcite .    </S>",
