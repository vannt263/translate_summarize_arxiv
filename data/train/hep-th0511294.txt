    "it has been displayed a technique for dealing with this quantum mechanics on noncommutative plane , which relies on the operatorial generalisation of dirac @xmath87-function ( see section [ sec : weyltransform ] ) ; as a consequence , density and green function on the ground state have been computed : in particular the two - point correlation function of density gives us an important key for understanding the physical precise meaning of the delocalization generated by noncommutativity , which has been shown to affect the short distance behaviour of the fluid itself .",
    "also , the long range effect has been shown to be the rescaling of the flux of magnetic field @xmath1 , and consequently the rescaling of filling fraction of the ground state .",
    "more extended analysis of this problem are deferred to a following work , in particular the application to the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
