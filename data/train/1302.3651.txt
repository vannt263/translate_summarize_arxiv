    "despite important progress over past few years , little is known about brain functional connectivity ( fc ) at rest , i.e. under no stimulation and in the absence of any overt - directed behaviour . in the studies on goal - directed mental activity ,",
    "spontaneous brain activity has been considered as random enough to be averaged out across many trials @xcite .",
    "however , well organized spatio - temporal low - frequency fluctuations ( @xmath0 0.1 hz ) have been observed in blood - oxygen - level - dependent ( bold ) fmri signals of a mammalian brain in the absence of any stimulation or task related behaviour @xcite .",
    "these well organized patterns of activity , suggest existence of underlying dynamics that governs intrinsic brain processes .",
    "existing large - scale models of the intrinsic brain dynamics focus on the relationship between functional and anatomical connectivity .",
    "they explore the range of conditions under which functional networks may emerge from known anatomical connections .",
    "in particular , roles of multiple time - scales in fc networks formation @xcite , time - delays in the signal propagation between the network nodes and system noise @xcite , local network oscillations @xcite and structural disconnection @xcite in the underlying dynamics have been investigated .",
    "although rsns reflect anatomical connectivity between brain areas comprising the networks in focus , fc can not be understood in those terms alone @xcite .    here , we combine experimental and modelling approaches to investigate dynamics underlying correlated behaviour of distant cortical regions .",
    "we choose to model the local node dynamics by excitable fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) neurons @xcite and use the resulting time - series to infer the neuronal activity at the network levels and subsequently low - frequency oscillations in the bold data @xcite .",
