    "even phenomena commonplace in high energy physics can occur in ultracold settings , where higgs modes have been observed  @xcite , unconventional `` color '' superfluidity  @xcite is possible , and where confinement mechanisms @xcite and axion electrodynamics  @xcite have been predicted .",
    "atomic quantum gases are charge neutral , and therefore , they are not affected by external electromagnetic fields the way electrons are .",

    "these static non - abelian gauge fields could be tailored so as to reproduce the effects of rashba - type spin - orbit couplings , but also , to mimic a variety of properties encountered in the context of high - energy physics .",

    "numerous theoretical proposals for simulating condensed matter models and realizing strongly correlated systems have been put forth , and recently , artificial gauge potentials corresponding to staggered  @xcite and uniform @xcite magnetic fluxes have been produced in optical lattices .",
    "all of these schemes create _ static _ gauge fields , in the sense that they are described by additional terms in the atomic hamiltonian (",
    "although the gauge fields can still have an externally imposed time dependence , leading to effective electric fields  @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical gauge fields ( which are described by their own hamiltonian and are not just imposed ) are important in many areas of physics , from particle physics where the gauge fields are the fundamental force carriers ( e.g. , ref .  ) , to many - body condensed - matter physics where they appear in effective field theories  @xcite . as such ,",
    "a number of proposals exist for creating dynamic gauge fields with ultracold atoms  @xcite , but to date their complexity has stymied experimental realization .    by emulating a fully dynamical field theory , which includes gauge fields , it is certainly tempting to envisage a quantum simulator that can address open questions from the standard model @xcite . mapping out the complete qcd phase diagram is a formidable task .",
    "it is also an np hard problem , and therefore highly intractable using classical computation . a special purpose quantum computer able to emulate the corresponding machinery from the standard model would significantly contribute to our understanding of the fundamental forces and processes in nature .",
    "although the fundamental nature of being able to create gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold quantum gases , with clear links to particle physics and the forces of nature , is a compelling argument for pursuing such an endeavor , there are also other , more practical , motivations to create these gauge fields .",
    "magnetic fields and spin - orbit coupling , in particular , appear to provide a route towards the preparation of topological states of matter @xcite , with some quite remarkable properties and promises for future applications @xcite .",
    "ultracold gases subject to artificial gauge fields provide an alternative route for reaching such exotic states of matter , with some added benefits from their unique probes and unprecedented flexibility in controlling many experimental parameters in these systems @xcite .",

    "the great interest in topological states of matter relies on the fact that such states are robust against external perturbations ( e.g. finite temperature , noise , or in general experimental imperfections ) .",
    "there are many intriguing phenomena associated with topological matter .",
    "the most striking is the existence of metallic edge states in a material that is insulating in the bulk @xcite . in the integer quantum hall effect @xcite",

    "much of the properties and information of topological systems can be extracted from the edge states .",
    "depending on the details of the particular physical setup ( e.g. the lattice geometry , the interactions , the number of magnetic flux per particle , the presence of spin - orbit coupling ) , these edge modes may turn out to have very exotic properties @xcite .",

    "one of the challenges and open questions would be how to develop schemes which allow for the creation and stability of such states , e.g. against various decay and heating processes that are generally present in experiments , and by doing so manipulate anyonic excitations in a well - controlled environment .    in this review ,",
    "we summarize different techniques for creating artificial gauge potentials in cold atom systems ( both implemented and proposed ) , pedagogically describing the main physical mechanisms behind each .",

    "the above analysis does not involve any assumption concerning a specific form of the trapping potential @xmath32 .",

    "lastly , rotation can be inferred by observing the weakening of the trap from the centripetal anti - confinement  @xcite .    in spite of the success creating large vortex lattices ,",
    "rotating systems have not entered the strongly correlated regime where the filling factor @xmath49 .",
    "this results from a technical limitation : at some point it becomes difficult to increase the angular momentum per particle and remain in equilibrium .",

    "[ fig_rotation]b ) using a series of ingenious evaporation tricks to increase the mean angular momentum per particle .",
    "a secondary technical challenge for studying strongly correlated systems is to confine the atoms into 2d planes .",
    "the confinement along @xmath52 should be large compared to the radial trapping .",
    "this is generally achieved using one - dimensional optical lattices , but technically it is difficult to create lattices with the required axial symmetry for rapid rotation experiments .",

    "very rapid rotation is possible owing to the very strong confinement in individual lattice sites , and the authors argue they have entered the few - atom strongly correlated regime .      besides rotation ,",
    "shaking optical lattices is another widely used experimental technique @xcite , which can trigger non - trivial topological effects and gauge structures in a rather direct manner @xcite .",
