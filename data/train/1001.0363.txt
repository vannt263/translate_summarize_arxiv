    "magnetic monopoles @xcite were advocated to symmetrize maxwell s equations in a manifest way that the mere existence of an isolated magnetic charge implies the quantization of electric charge .",
    "the fresh interests in this subject are enhanced with the idea of t hooft and polyakov @xcite that the classical solutions having the properties of magnetic monopoles may be found in yang - mills gauge theories .",
    "the dirac monopoles were elementary particles but the t hooft - polyakov @xcite monopoles are complicated extended object having a definite mass and finite size inside of which massive fields play an important role in providing a smooth structure and outside it they vanish rapidly leaving the field configuration identical to abelian dirac monopole .",
    "julia and zee @xcite extended the theory of non - abelian monopoles of t hooft - polyakov @xcite to the theory of non abelian dyons ( particles carrying simultaneously electric and magnetic charges ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical excitation of fundamental monopoles include dyons which are automatically arisen from the semi - classical quantization of global charge rotation degree of freedom of monopoles . despite of the potential importance of monopoles @xcite and dyons @xcite , the formalism necessary to describe them",
    "has been clumsy and not manifestly covariant .",
    "so , a self consistent and manifestly covariant theory of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons ( particle carrying electric and magnetic charges ) and those for generalized fields of gravitodyons , has been constructed @xcite in terms of two four - potentials to avoid the use of controversial string variables . on the other hand , the quaternionic formulation @xcite of electrodynamics has a long history @xcite , stretching back to maxwell himself @xcite who used real ( hamilton ) quaternion in his original manuscript on the application of quaternion to electromagnetism and in his celebrated book `` treatise on electricity and magnetism '' .",
    "quaternion analysis has since been rediscovered at regular intervals and accordingly the maxwell s equations of electromagnetism were rewritten as one quaternion equations @xcite .",
    "negi and coworkers @xcite , have also studied the quaternionic formulation for generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons ( particles carrying simultaneous existence of electric and magnetic charges ) in unique , simpler and compact notations .",
    "kravchenko and co - authors @xcite , discussed the maxwell s equations in homogeneous media , chiral media and inhomogeneous media .",
    "accordingly they have developed the quaternionic reformulation of the time - dependent maxwell s equations along with the classical solution of a moving source i.e. electron . in the series of papers negi and coworkers @xcite have derived the generalized dirac - maxwell ( gdm ) equations in presence of electric and magnetic sources in an isotropic ( homogeneous ) medium .",
    "they have also analyzed the other quantum equations of dyons in consistent and manifest covariant way @xcite .",
    "this theory has been shown to remain invariant under the duality transformations in isotropic homogeneous medium .",
    "quaternion analysis of time dependent maxwells equations has been developed by them @xcite in presence of electric and magnetic charges and the solutions for the classical problem of moving charge ( electric and magnetic ) are obtained consistently .",
    "the time dependent generalized dirac - maxwells ( gdm ) equations of dyons are also discussed @xcite in chiral and inhomogeneous media and the solutions for the classical problem are obtained .",
    "the quaternion reformulation of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons in chiral and inhomogeneous media has also been analyzed @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic fields of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons have also discussed @xcite in slowly changing media in a consistent manner . the quaternion analysis has also been used @xcite to combine the complex desciption of dyons and gravito - dyons and accordingly the unified quaternionic angular momentum for generalized fields of dyons and gravito - dyons along with their commutation relations has been analyzed in unique and consistent manner . in this paper , we have made an attempt to developed a self consistant and manifestly covariant theory for the dynamics of four charges ( masses ) ( namely electric , magnetic , gravitational , heavisidian ) has been developed in simple , compact and consistent manner . starting with an invariant lagrangian density and its quaternionic representation ,",
    "we have obtained the consistent field equation and equation of motion for the dynamics of four charges .",
    "it has been shown that the present reformulation reproduces the dynamics of individual charges ( masses ) in the absence of other charge ( masses ) as well as the generalized theory of dyons ( gravito - dyons ) in the absence gravito - dyons ( dyons ) and vice versa ..",
    "let us describe the property of quaternion algebra with the use of natural units @xmath0 in order to reformulate the unified theory of generalized electromagnetic fields ( associated with dyons ) and generalized gravito - heavisidian fields ( associated with gravito - dyons ) of linear gravity .",
    "so we define the unified charge @xcite as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively described as the electric , magnetic , gravitational and heavisidian charges ( masses).in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the quaternion units satisfy the following properties    @xmath6    and    @xmath7    complex structure @xmath8 represents the generalized charge of dyons of electromagnetic fields while @xmath9 denotes the generalized charge of gravito - dyons .",
    "the norm of unified quaternion charge ( [ eq:1 ] ) is    @xmath10    where    @xmath11    unified quaternion valued four - potential may then be defined as@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the four - potential associated with the dynamics of electric charge , @xmath14 is used for magnetic charge , @xmath15 describes the gravitational charge ( mass ) while @xmath16 has been associated with the gravi - magnetic ( heavisidian ) charge ( mass )",
    ". then the varius potentials of equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) are written in the following quaternionic forms ,    @xmath17    similarly one may define @xcite the quaternion valued unified field tensor as    @xmath18    where    @xmath19    are the field tensors respectively associated with the dynamics of the electric , magnetic , gravitational and heavisidian charges ( masses ) .",

    "we vary the trajectory of the particle without changing the field parameters and as such the action @xmath42 does not affect the motion . on the other hand , in order to find the field equations we take the variation with respect to field parameters assuming the trajectory of the particle fixed . for deriving the equation of motion , we write the concerned part of action in the following form ,    @xmath44    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are expressed in terms of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
