    "it is by now well  known that the content of two  dimensional conformal field theories ( cft ) is best exposed on surfaces with distinct topology , an idea that goes back to cardy @xcite . in the same way open and closed strings are related to each other , the study of a cft on a surface with boundaries ( a cylinder say ) is deeply connected with its formulation on a torus .",
    "bulk data and boundary data are inextricably related and subjected to numerous cross consistency constraints @xcite .",
    "aspects of these connections can be most elegantly expressed in terms of graphs @xcite : on a cylinder , their nodes label the consistent boundary conditions and their adjacency matrices yield the partition functions , whereas on the torus , their spectra code the diagonal part of modular invariants .",
    "partition functions are fundamental objects characterizing a specific cft . on the torus , they are modular invariant and yield the field content in the periodic sector . on the cylinder , they similarly give the field content in the presence of boundary conditions .",
    "torus and cylinder partition functions are not independent : the cardy equation @xcite relates the boundary states and the boundary partition functions to the periodic hilbert space in the bulk",
    ".    the presence of a discrete symmetry within a cft can be probed by allowing non trivial monodromies of the fields along non contractible loops @xcite , leading to twisted partition functions . on the torus , these partition functions must transform covariantly under the modular group , thereby relating the bulk hilbert spaces of the various twisted sectors . on the cylinder ,",
    "the analogous statement is a generalized cardy equation , which relates the boundary hilbert spaces , and the action of the symmetry group on them , with the bulk hilbert spaces in the twisted sectors .    for the affine @xmath2 and @xmath3 theories ,",
    "the ( discrete ) symmetry group of each model has been determined in @xcite from an analysis on the torus .",
    "the object of this article is to extend the study to the cylinder , following a method presented in @xcite for the virasoro minimal models .",
    "as on the torus , where most of the information about the symmetry group and its action on the fields was encoded in the graphs , we find here that the same relationship holds on the cylinder .    therefore , instead of giving the detailed , case by case results of our analysis , it is more appealing to say how they can be extracted from basic data of the graph . to this end",
    "we provide in table 2 a chart summarizing our observations on the way the symmetry data can be read off from the graph data .",
    "this table is a central result of this paper .    before going to the cylinder",
    ", we start in section 2 by briefly recalling the highlights of the analysis on the torus . a number of observations , made in the virasoro minimal models and in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 affine models and which turn out to be crucial for the rest of the analysis ,",
    "are explained ( and included in the synoptic table ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a general discussion of the boundary conditions and of the cylinder partition functions when the theory has a symmetry group .",
    "the main result here is that a boundary condition invariant under a symmetry subgroup can be expanded on the ishibashi states taken from the torus sectors twisted by that subgroup .",
    "it directly leads to a sequence of cardy equations .    relying in an essential way on the observations recalled in section 2 , the fourth section and an appendix make explicit the action of the symmetry group on the boundary conditions for the affine models considered here .",
    "for the same models , section 5 solves the cardy equations for the boundary conditions which have a non trivial isotropy group , thereby determining the way this group acts on the corresponding boundary hilbert spaces .",
    "we show that the relevant information can be extracted from subgraphs , made of the nodes left fixed by the isotropy group .",
    "when a conformal field theory has a symmetry group @xmath4 , twisted boundary conditions around non ",
    "contractible loops may be considered @xcite .",
    "they can be obtained from periodic boundary conditions by letting a group element act before closing the loop , or from the insertion of suitable disorder fields .",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions are labeled by group elements ( there may be others @xcite ) .    on a torus",
    ", there are two independent periods , chosen as 1 and @xmath5 .",
    "choosing respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( i.e. periodic ) boundary conditions along the two periods yields the partition function of the @xmath6twisted sector in the form z_g , e ( ) = tr__g [ t_g ] = _ ( j , j ) _ g m_j , j^(g ) ^*_j _ j , where @xmath8 is the ( finite distance ) transfer matrix with monodromy @xmath6 .",
    "the twisted hilbert space has been decomposed as @xmath9 in terms of inequivalent representations of the symmetry algebra , with ( integer ) multiplicities @xmath10 .    a group element @xmath11 maps @xmath12 to the isomorphic space @xmath13 since the conjugation by @xmath11 changes the monodromy of the transfer matrix : z_g , e = tr__g [ f^-1ft_g f^-1f ] = tr__fgf^-1 [ t_fgf^-1 ] = z_fgf^-1,e .",
    "it follows that the centralizer of @xmath6 has an action into @xmath12 .",
    "the symmetry means that the chiral algebra is left invariant by @xmath4 , so that @xmath4 can only rotate a whole representation to an equivalent one .",
    "thus one finds z_g , g ( ) = tr__g [ t_g g ] = _ ( j , j ) _ g _ j , j(g;g ) ^*_j _ j , gg=gg , [ zgg ] with @xmath14 the character of @xmath15 acting on the @xmath10 degenerate representations in the sector @xmath6 .",
    "this action is unitary , and can be diagonalized , implying that all @xmath14 can be written as a sum of roots of unity ( charges ) , of order equal to the order of @xmath15 .",
    "the twisted partition functions should not be intrinsically sensitive to a modular change of the modulus .",
    "since a modular transformation mixes the two periods , the invariance holds provided the boundary conditions are accordingly changed .",
    "this results in the following identities z_g , g ( ) = z_g , gg(+1 ) = z_g^-1,g(- ) .",
    "[ mod ]    the presence of a symmetry group can be asserted by finding a consistent set of functions of the form ( [ zgg ] ) that transform covariantly under the modular group as in ( [ mod ] ) .",
    "this set of functions contains in particular the modular invariant partition function @xmath16 . for the affine models based on @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", this analysis has been completed in @xcite .    for the @xmath0 affine models , classified by a list of ade partition functions , the symmetry group @xmath4 is the group of automorphisms of the dynkin diagram a , d or e , associated with the modular invariant , except for the @xmath17 models , @xmath18 odd (",
    "that is , the diagonal theories for @xmath19 , @xmath20 odd ) , which have no symmetry but it is realized projectively @xcite . ] . for the @xmath1 models ,",
    "the symmetry groups are listed in table 1 for all modular invariant partition functions .    beyond the mere knowledge of the group , the partition functions must be given .",
    "we will not reproduce the list here , which can be found in @xcite , but we simply recall the relations they bear with graphs .",
    "the observations we made regarding these relations are summarized on the left half of table 2 , and will play a essential role on the cylinder .",
    "graphs were originally associated with a given modular invariant @xcite , more precisely with its diagonal terms : z_e , e ( ) = _ ( j , j ) _ e _ j , j(e;e ) |_j()|^2 + .",
    "one first defines the set of exponents @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is taken in @xmath23 with multiplicity @xmath24 .",
    "thus the cardinal of @xmath23 is the number of diagonal terms in @xmath16 . to this",
    "set @xmath23 one then associates a collection of graphs @xmath25 such that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix @xmath26 of @xmath27 form the set @xmath28 for @xmath22 in @xmath23 , with @xmath29 the matrix representing the modular transformation @xmath30 on the characters .",
    "the number of graphs is equal to the dimension of the chiral fusion ring , each graph living on a set of @xmath31 nodes , denoted @xmath32 . from their spectrum , the matrices @xmath26 form a non  negative integer representation of the fusion ring ( a `` nimrep '' ) . among them",
    "one can choose a set of generators , and the corresponding graphs , which we will call the generating graphs . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 affine models ,",
    "the fusion ring has one generator @xmath33 , so that a single graph @xmath34 needs be given for each modular invariant ( the index @xmath11 can be chosen to be a fundamental representation ) .    for @xmath0",
    ", there is a unique generating graph associated with a modular invariant of a , d or e type , and it is precisely the corresponding dynkin diagram @xcite . for @xmath1 , one generating",
    "graph has been found for each modular invariant , but in three cases , several ( isospectral ) graphs are known @xcite : the two self  conjugate invariants @xmath35 and @xmath36 can each be associated two different generating graphs , usually denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while for the exceptional invariant @xmath39 , three isospectral graphs @xmath40 exist .",
    "the resulting list of graphs , likely to be complete but not proved to be so , can be found in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the symmetry group @xmath4 in the affine models is very close to the automorphism group of the generating of the nimrep @xmath41 , or equivalently the intersection @xmath42 aut@xmath43 . ]",
    "graph @xmath34 .",
    "the two groups are equal in all @xmath0 models except those of even rank @xmath44 type . for @xmath1 ,",
    "two types of graphs are to be distinguished .",
    "the fold graphs , @xmath45 and @xmath46 by a @xmath47 group . ] associated to the theories @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 have an automorphism group ( often trivial ) with no direct relation to @xmath4 . for all other graphs ,",
    "@xmath4 is either equal to or is a subgroup of aut @xmath34 .",
    "( see table 1 for a comparison of @xmath4 and aut@xmath51 in all cases . )",
    "the relevance of the graph is strengthened by the following two observations @xcite .    1 .",
    "for the non  fold graphs , @xmath4 is a subgroup of the graph automorphisms . as such it acts on an eigenbasis @xmath52 of the adjacency matrices @xmath26 .",
    "it leaves invariant the various eigensubspaces , labeled by the exponents of @xmath23 which are different , and so it acts by a block diagonal representation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 has dimension @xmath55 ( the multiplicity of @xmath22 in @xmath23 ) .",
    "being the symmetry group of the conformal theory , @xmath4 also acts on the periodic hilbert space , in particular on the diagonal representations of @xmath56 .",
    "this action is again block diagonal since @xmath4 can only mix degenerate @xmath57 , also labeled by the distinct exponents .",
    "thus @xmath4 acts on @xmath58 through a reduced representation @xmath59 of the same form as @xmath60 .",
    "+ our first observation is that @xmath61 coincides ) . on the other hand , @xmath62 is known only through its character ( from the partition functions ) . ] with @xmath60 ( up to the choice of basis , so they are equivalent ) .",
    "therefore the numbers @xmath63 that appear in front of the diagonal terms of @xmath64 are exactly the characters of the automorphism @xmath6 acting on the eigenspaces of the matrices ( graphs ) @xmath26 z_e , g = _ j : ( j , j ) _ e _ j , j(e;g ) |_j|^2 +  _ j , j(e;g ) = chr_j(g ) .",
    "[ eigen ] therefore the @xmath4charges of the scalar fields in the periodic sector are entirely dictated by the graph ( the charges are noted @xmath65 in table 2 ; they are the eigenvalues of the representation @xmath66 or @xmath67 of which @xmath63 is the character ) . + for the fold graphs of @xmath1 , it turns out that all scalar fields in @xmath16 are invariant under the action of @xmath4 ( all @xmath68 for all @xmath6 ) .",
    "then the above observation still holds if we view the whole of @xmath4 as having no action at all on the graphs .",
    "the same view will be suggested when going to the cylinder .",
    "it is very natural to define sets of twisted exponents @xmath69 , where each @xmath22 is again taken with the multiplicity of @xmath70 in @xmath12 , and for each @xmath6 , to look for matrices @xmath71 whose spectrum is given by the set @xmath28 for @xmath22 in @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath71 again satisfy the fusion algebra and are polynomially expressible in terms of a few generators , in our case , just one , namely @xmath73 .",
    "it no longer is a positive integer matrix in general , but when its entries are sums of roots of unity , as will soon be the case , one can see it as the adjacency matrix of a phased graph . +",
    "a simple inspection of the torus twisted partition functions reveals the striking fact that @xmath74 is equal to the number of graph nodes that are fixed by @xmath6 |_g| = # \\{a : g(a ) = a}. [ fixed ] moreover , in many cases , the restriction @xmath75 of the generating graph @xmath34 to the nodes fixed by @xmath6 has the right spectrum @xmath76 .",
    "this is quite non  trivial in view of the wild spectral changes that a restriction usually causes . in those happy cases",
    ", one could set @xmath77 and generate all @xmath71 from it is still positive integer  valued but the other matrices @xmath71 will not be positive ( albeit integral ) . ] .",
    "finally , it was noted that for @xmath78 , all diagonal terms of @xmath79 are invariant under the centralizer of @xmath6 , except for the @xmath80 and @xmath81 invariants of @xmath82 ( which are the only cases where the centralizer of @xmath6 is not generated by @xmath6 ) .",
    "the second observation , which extends the first one to the non periodic sectors , is very suggestive , but as such , remains vague . in a sense it is the purpose of this article to give them a full and precise meaning on the cylinder .",
    "as we shall see , these observations will have very strong consequences on the determination of the cylinder partition functions .",
    "the previous section spelt out the consequences of an internal symmetry for the formulation on a torus , and its connection to graphs .",
    "the question we ask now is what this analysis becomes on a cylinder .",
    "we view the cylinder of perimeter @xmath83 and length @xmath84 as a rectangle , with vertical sides identified .",
    "there are two boundaries , the two horizontal sides , on which boundary conditions @xmath85 and @xmath86 are prescribed .",
    "we will require that they preserve the chiral algebra present , here an affine algebra .",
    "the way boundary conditions can be handled is by now standard @xcite ; we will adapt the usual presentation in order to include the symmetry .",
    "the symmetry group acts on all the states . in particular , its acts on the boundary conditions @xmath87 , and on the states that can circulate the non  trivial cycle .",
    "the latter may have a non trivial monodromy around that loop , which , as before , can be implemented by the insertion of a disorder line , running from one boundary to the other ( see figure 1 ) .    as usual",
    ", there are two equivalent ways of computing the partition function corresponding to boundary conditions @xmath88 and monodromy @xmath6 . if constant time slices are the closed horizontal circles , the proper hilbert space to consider is @xmath12 , encountered above on the torus ( and thus known ) . on the boundaries ,",
    "the boundary conditions prescribe boundary states @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "then the partition function is z^(g)_b|a = e^- m h_g = e^(l_0 + |l_0 - ) .",
    "[ zabg1 ]    if instead the time is chosen to run along the horizontal coordinate , the space corresponds to the segment of length @xmath84 , with boundary conditions @xmath85 and @xmath86 at the two ends .",
    "the hilbert space is now some @xmath91 ( independent of @xmath6 ) . the time translation is periodic with period @xmath83 , resulting in the partition function z^(g)_b|a = tr^__b|a [ g e^- l h_b|a ] = tr^__b|a [ ge^- ( l_0- ) ] .",
    "[ zabg2 ] various constraints on @xmath88 and @xmath91 arise from the equality of these two forms ( moreover @xmath6 may be varied independently over the symmetry group @xmath4 ) .",
    "the first form ( [ zabg1 ] ) shows that both boundary states @xmath85 and @xmath86 should have a projection in the space @xmath12 .",
    "if the projection of either one vanishes , so does the partition function @xmath92 . in the second form ( [ zabg2 ] ) , the states of @xmath91 are transported around the perimeter , acted on by @xmath6 , and projected on themselves .",

    "@xmath86 are not invariant under @xmath6 ( the form ( [ zabg2 ] ) would not be well  defined and would depend on the position of the disorder line ) .    combining the two observations",
    ", one learns that boundary states belong to the hilbert spaces @xmath12 for those @xmath6 which leave them invariant : = _",
    "g.    the boundary states preserving the chiral algebra must satisfy the linear equations @xmath94 { \\mbox{$\\left|a\\right>$ } } = 0 $ ] for all @xmath95 , for conformal invariance , and similar equations with the affine generators @xmath96 for the affine invariance .",
    "they form a vector space , where a convenient basis is provided by the so  called ishibashi states @xmath97 .",

    "( [ cardy2 ] ) ) .",
    "it means that @xmath141 is unitary , and this in turn implies that all @xmath153 are diagonalizable , have a spectrum equal to the set of ratios @xmath154 , and therefore form a representation of the fusion algebra .",
    "it also means that the @xmath6invariant pure boundary conditions ( nodes fixed by @xmath6 ) form a complete set of @xmath6invariant boundary conditions .",
    "this puts the twisted data @xmath71 on an equal footing as the untwisted @xmath26 , with of course several important differences .",
    "first , the @xmath71 form representations of the fusion ring of ( much ) lower dimension than the @xmath26 .",
    "second , the matrices @xmath71 for fixed @xmath6 , do not yield a nimrep , but instead a @xmath155valued representation of the fusion algebra , with @xmath156 and @xmath157 the order of @xmath6 .",
    "one may interpret them as adjacency matrices of phased graphs , in which links are assigned phases .",
    "in addition , all @xmath71 must be compatible with @xmath26 , in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ char ] ) .",
    "it implies , for every @xmath158 ( the subgroup leaving the boundary conditions @xmath85 and @xmath86 invariant ) , that ( n^(g)i_ab)^ * = n^i_ab ( 1-_n ) .",
    "this compatibility condition can be put in yet another but more suggestive form : for fixed @xmath6 , the matrix @xmath153 , with indices in the set of @xmath6invariant boundary conditions , is equal to the restriction of @xmath26 to the nodes fixed by @xmath6 , up to phases ( @xmath157th roots of unity ) .",
    "this firmly suggests that solutions @xmath153 to the cardy equation can be obtained from those subgraphs , by going through the following steps :    * consider the subgraphs @xmath159 corresponding to the nodes fixed by @xmath6 and their adjacency matrices ; * weigh the adjacency matrices by appropriate phases so as to reproduce the correct spectra @xmath154 ( that is , attach every link of the subgraphs a phase rather than the number 1 , thus obtaining a phased graph ) ; * then check the compatibility of the resulting matrices with the @xmath26 .    this procedure has been used to obtain the solutions @xmath71 presented below in terms of the generator @xmath73 of the fusion algebra ( @xmath160 for @xmath1 ) .",
    "it turns out that in @xmath0 , @xmath73 is the plain restriction of @xmath33 to the nodes fixed by @xmath6 , i.e. no weight on the links . on the other hand , non",
    "trivial weights are required in @xmath1 in order to achieve the desired spectra .",
    "this procedure however does not guarantee the uniqueness of the solutions it produces .",
    "the generating matrices @xmath73 are primarily constrained by their spectrum , so that a unitary redefinition @xmath161 is possible ( it amounts to @xmath162 ) , provided the entries of @xmath163 are combinations of @xmath18th roots of unity , so that the new matrices be still @xmath155valued .",
    "the other constraints on @xmath73 are the group properties with respect to @xmath6 : their entries must be characters , eq .",
    "( [ char ] ) .",
    "a general unitary rotation replaces @xmath164 by a linear combination @xmath165 taken over all sectors @xmath166 invariant under @xmath6 .",
    "it is very implausible that these new combinations will have the character property .",
    "moreover they mix characters from different sectors of boundary conditions , which is very unnatural ( the various boundary conditions being mixed have also different isotropy groups in general ) .",
    "altough we have no formal proof of that , the only reasonable unitary transformations are by diagonal matrices , which transform @xmath164 into @xmath167 , for some roots of unity @xmath168 ( which suitably depend on @xmath6 so as to keep the character property ) .",
    "at least , we could verify in all models but the @xmath169 series of @xmath1 that no other transformation is allowed .",
    "we will not dwell on this phase freedom .",
    "it has been discussed in the virasoro minimal models in @xcite , where the perron  frobenius theorem was used to determine these phases , relying on the assumption that the non  degeneracy of the groundstate of the transfer matrix carried over in the continuum limit .",
    "the affine models however are not known to be the scaling limits of critical lattice models . moreover , in @xmath1 models , the groundstate turns out to be degenerate for many boundary conditions .",
    "consequently there is no natural way to fix the freedom in the phases .",
    "( we note nonetheless that all solutions for @xmath0 given below , satisfy the perron  frobenius criterion . )",
    "the @xmath0 models are particularly simple since the subgraphs of nodes fixed by a symmetry are very small , containing one or two nodes .",
    "only the @xmath169 theories have a large , unbounded number of fixed points .",
    "the theories with a symmetry group are the series of @xmath17 for @xmath18 even , all @xmath170 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , which all have a @xmath173 symmetry , except the theory @xmath174 which has an @xmath175 symmetry .",
    "the subgraphs fixed by the @xmath173 form , respectively , an @xmath176 graph , an @xmath177 graph and an @xmath178 graph .",
    "the @xmath174 theory has in addition a single node fixed by the @xmath47 ( and by the whole of @xmath175 ) .    in all cases",
    ", one may verify that the adjacency matrix of the subgraph @xmath179 of nodes fixed by @xmath6 provides a solution @xmath73 to the cardy equation and satisfies the group property ( [ char ] ) .",
    "the other matrices @xmath180 are generated from @xmath73 via the tchebychev polynomials .",
    "they are in general different from the restriction of the @xmath26 to the fixed subgraphs .",
    "the simplest way to see that they have the right spectrum is to observe that all fixed subgraphs are @xmath181 graphs for a level @xmath182 which divides the level @xmath18 of the original theory , and that the set of twisted exponents is exactly equal to @xmath183 ( see @xcite for the sets @xmath72 ) .",
    "we quickly review the results for the @xmath1 models .",
    "we again distinguish two classes of theories .",
    "one class contains the models @xmath184 , @xmath138 and @xmath121 , which are those associated with a fold graph ( unlike the @xmath0 notations , the subscript refers here to the height @xmath185 ) .",

    "all other models either have no symmetry at all , or no invariant boundary conditions .",
    "the main difference between the two classes is that the models in the first one have all their boundary conditions invariant under the symmetry .",
    "they are also more easily handled .",
    "for @xmath188 the integrable highest weights , we denote the automorphisms ( simple currents ) of @xmath189 as @xmath190 , with respect to which the @xmath29 modular matrix transforms as @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the triality of @xmath22 and @xmath193 .    in what follows",
    ", we will take the sets of exponents @xmath72 as given by the twisted partition functions computed in @xcite .",
    "all models in this class have @xmath47 as symmetry group , and thus three sets of exponents @xmath23 , @xmath72 and @xmath194 . in all cases , these three sets have the same cardinality , and are explicitely given as @xmath195 and @xmath196 , with @xmath197 or 2 depending on the models .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath138 theories , we find @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , so that @xmath201 .",

    "a direct consequence is that the spectra of @xmath153 and @xmath26 are related by \\",

    "we note that , in the graphs associated to all these theories , some of the links are unoriented , which means that the corresponding sector of boundary conditions has a degenerate groundstate ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "one finds in this class the @xmath186 , @xmath206 and @xmath39 theories , all with a @xmath47 symmetry , and also the @xmath80 and @xmath81 theories , both with an @xmath207 symmetry .",
    "the series @xmath186 is trivial : the node @xmath208 is the only one that is invariant under @xmath47 . since @xmath209 , cardy s equation says that @xmath210 is the only solution ( which coincides with the restriction of @xmath33 to the fixed node ) .",

    "for the first one , the matrix @xmath73 corresponds to assigning the phases @xmath213 and @xmath214 to the two double links .    in the case of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",

    "the restriction of @xmath33 is equal to @xmath222 , and @xmath73 simply corresponds to assigning the double link the phases @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
