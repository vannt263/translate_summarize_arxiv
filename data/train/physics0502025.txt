    "the purpose of this paper is to show that bessel beams of electromagnetic radiation ( described in detail in the textbook by stratton @xcite ) may serve as beam guides for charged particles .",
    "the confining mechanism in the transverse direction can be explained as due to an interplay between the lorentz force and the coriolis force in the frame rotating with the electromagnetic wave .",
    "exact analytic solutions of the lorentz , schrdinger , klein - gordon , and dirac equations describing beams of charged particles moving in the presence of an electromagnetic wave with a vortex line have been presented in @xcite for a special , very simple form of electromagnetic wave carrying angular momentum .",
    "these fields are not realistic since the electric and magnetic fields grow without bound with the distance from the vortex line .",
    "however , the motion of particles in such maxwell fields helps to understand the confinement mechanism of particles by electromagnetic vortices .",
    "in addition , these simple solutions approximate very well more realistic solutions in the vicinity of vortex lines . in the present paper , we shall show that the same confining mechanism is responsible for guiding electrons inside bessel beams of electromagnetic field .",
    "bessel beams are still not fully realistic because the field vectors fall off too slowly to make the energy finite , but they are much closer to the physical reality .",
    "bessel beams of light were produced for the first time by durnin , miceli , and eberly @xcite using an annular slit .",
    "later , bessel beams were produced also by other methods @xcite . in order to trap electrons ,",
    "as we shall explain in the present paper , higher order bessel light beams are more useful .",
    "they were produced first by an axicon @xcite and later in biaxial crystals @xcite",
    "bessel beams appear in a natural way as solutions of maxwell equations in cylindrical coordinates @xcite .",
    "these solutions are conveniently described using the ( differently normalized ) riemann - silberstein @xcite vector @xmath0 , @xmath1 with the use of the complex vector @xmath0 , we may rewrite all four maxwell equations as two equations @xmath2 the separation of the complex vector @xmath3 into its real ( electric ) and imaginary ( magnetic ) parts will be needed when writing down the equations of motion for electrons .    since we are interested in the beam - like fields , we shall seek the solution of ( [ max ] ) in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 . substituting this ansatz into the maxwell equations ( [ max ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath6 from the first two equations we may determine @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of a single complex function @xmath9    [ fxyz ] @xmath10    where @xmath11 . upon substituting these formulas into the third equation , we obtain the helmholtz equation in 2d that must be satisfied by @xmath12 @xmath13 _ every solution _ of this equation gives rise to a non - diffracting beam .",
    "various analytic solutions may be obtained by separating the variables .",
    "there are three coordinate systems which allow for the separation of variables : polar , elliptic , and parabolic coordinates ( cf .",
    ", for example , ref .",
    "the separation of variables in elliptic and parabolic coordinates in the helmholtz equation leads to mathieu and weber functions , respectively .",
    "the corresponding nondiffracting beams look quite intriguing but they seem to be very difficult to produce in reality . in the present paper we shall restrict ourselves to the separation of variables in polar coordinates that leads to bessel functions . in the degenerate case ,",
    "when @xmath14 , the helmholtz equation reduces to the laplace equation which separates in many other coordinates @xcite and has a plethora of solutions . in particular , every analytic function of either @xmath15 or @xmath16 is a solution .",
    "the function @xmath12 for the bessel beam will be chosen in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the field amplitude measured in units of the electric field .",
    "the bessel beam may be characterized by four `` quantum numbers '' @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the meaning of these numbers in terms of the associated eigenvalue problems is discussed in the appendix . according to eqs .",
    "( [ fxyz ] ) , the solution of maxwell equations ( [ max ] ) , characterized by these four numbers , has the form    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in the derivation",
    ", we used the formulas @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and also the relations between the bessel functions and their derivatives @xmath27 .",
    "since bessel beams carry angular momentum , the electric and magnetic fields rotate as we move around the beam center ( the @xmath28-axis ) . moreover , the @xmath28-axis is at the same time the vortex line ( except , when @xmath29 ) according to the general definition proposed in @xcite .    the bessel beam for @xmath30 will play a special role in our analysis because it is directly related to our earlier work .",
    "namely , the limit of the bessel beam with @xmath30 , when @xmath31 , is the following solution of the maxwell equations @xmath32 this electromagnetic field is a good ( but not uniform ) approximation to the bessel beam for @xmath30 in the region where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are much smaller than 1 .",
    "it is the simplest example of a solution of maxwell equations characterized in @xcite as `` a vortex line riding atop a null solution '' ( null solution means that @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "electromagnetic wave ( [ msol ] ) is not a plane wave but it has the properties found before only for plane waves .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , one may find analytic solutions of the lorentz equations of motion of a charged particle in this field and also analytic solutions of the schrdinger , dirac , and klein -gordon equations .",
    "in the present work we have used this exactly soluble case as a guide in our study of the particle s motion in a bessel beam .",
    "we shall analyze the motion of a charged particle in a bessel beam in a relativistic formulation in view of possible applications to highly energetic electrons .",
    "the equations of motion are in this case most conveniently expressed in terms of derivatives ( denoted by dots ) with respect to the proper time @xmath37 @xmath38 the trajectory is described by four functions of @xmath39 @xmath40 the equations of motion to be solved , in the three - dimensional notation have the form    [ eqnr ] @xmath41    in our analysis there will always be a distinguished wave frequency @xmath42 and the corresponding wave - vector length @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , it will be convenient to use @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the natural units of time and distance .",
    "there are also the characteristic amplitudes of the electric field @xmath46 and of the magnetic field @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we shall measure the velocity of electrons in units of @xmath48 .",
    "we would like to stress that all values of electron velocities appearing in this paper are the derivatives with respect to the proper time @xmath39 .",
    "they can exceed the speed of light since they differ from the laboratory velocities by the relativistic factor @xmath49 . in these units ,",
    "the strength of the interaction of the electron with the electromagnetic field is characterized by a single dimensionless parameter @xmath50 .",
    "this dimensionless parameter is known either as the _ laser - strength parameter _",

    "@xcite , electrons with initial transverse velocity as large as 0.0012c are trapped by a bessel beam of moderate intensity of the order of @xmath69w / m@xmath70 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the electron trajectories obtained for three different transverse velocities and for @xmath71 . in all figures presented in this paper the ratio of the transverse wave vector @xmath72 to the longitudinal component of wave vector @xmath73 is 1:100 .",
    "the trapping of relativistic electrons requires higher values of @xmath50 .",
    "this can be achieved either by increasing the intensity or lowering the frequency . in fig .",

    "this value of @xmath50 may , for example , correspond to the microwave frequency @xmath76hz and the intensity @xmath77 ( calculated from the formula @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is in w / m@xmath70 and @xmath80 is in hz ) . in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] we show the projection of the electron motion on the @xmath81 plane for two different sets of initial conditions .",
    "it is clearly seen that the motion in the transverse plane is confined to the vicinity of the vortex line but its details depend very much on the initial data .",

    "the calculation of the electron trajectories in these regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) fully confirms this expectation .",
    "we find there stationary ( though wiggly ) orbits .",
    "in contrast to ordinary bound states in static potentials , kinetic energies of electrons trapped in bessel beams are lower for higher orbits .",

    "were chosen sufficiently far from the center as @xmath92 and @xmath91 , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in addition to regular solutions , the helmholtz equation has also solutions with singularities .",
    "these singular solutions must be excluded if we allow the field to occupy the whole space . however ,",
    "when portions of space where the singularities occur , due to the presence of some obstacles , are inaccessible , then these singular solutions must , in general , be included to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "this takes place , for example , in the case of cylindrical coaxial lines . in order to satisfy the boundary conditions we have to include in the solution , in addition to bessel functions @xmath93 also the neumann functions @xmath94 ( bessel functions of the second kind ) .",
    "since neumann functions satisfy the same differential equation as the bessel functions , the solutions of the maxwell equations describing neumann beams can be obtained directly from our formulas ( [ cyl1 ] ) by replacing all bessel functions by the corresponding neumann functions .",
    "this will give a solution of the maxwell equations everywhere , except on the line @xmath95 .",
    "assuming that the vicinity of this line is in some way shielded , we can study the motion of electrons in the region where the electromagnetic field is regular . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show two trajectories of electrons that were obtained under similar conditions as those in fig .  [ fig6 ] but for a neumann beam with @xmath29 .",

    "this representation exhibits clearly a screw symmetry of the bessel beam ; changing simultaneously @xmath28 and @xmath101 in the right proportions @xmath102 and @xmath103 , leaves the field @xmath98 unchanged . it can also be shown that , as time goes by , at each point in space the tips of the electric and magnetic field vectors follow each other tracing the same ellipse with the frequency @xmath42 .",
    "the parameters of these ellipses depend on @xmath104 and not on @xmath28 and @xmath101 .",
    "each ellipse lies in a plane determined by its normal vector @xmath105 @xmath106 we can freeze the motion of the electric and magnetic field vectors by going to a new coordinate frame rotating with the frequency @xmath107 .",

    "this transformation eliminates the time variable  in the rotating frame the electromagnetic forces become time independent . a typical configuration of the electric field is shown in fig .",
    "this configuration resembles the forces acting on a ball moving on the saddle surface , shown in fig .",
    "obviously , such a field configuration does not have a stable equilibrium point .",
    "however , in a rotating frame , in addition to the lorentz force , there appear also the coriolis force and the centrifugal force .",
    "these two inertial forces , together with the electric field of the wave , are responsible for the electron trapping in the transverse direction .",
    "the magnetic field plays a less important role in the trapping mechanism , as illustrated in figs .",

    "the present case belongs to the same category of phenomena as the trojan asteroids @xcite , the trojan states of electrons in atoms @xcite or in molecules @xcite , and the paul trap @xcite . in all these systems",
    "periodically changing forces lead to a dynamical equilibrium . in the case of trojan states , the periodical changes of the forces",
    "are due to rotation . in the rotating frame",
    "the coriolis force and the centrifugal force create a dynamical equilibrium in an otherwise unstable system .",

    "( [ cyl1 ] ) in which all functions @xmath93 are replaced by either @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
