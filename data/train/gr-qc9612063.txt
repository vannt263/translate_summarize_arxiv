    "it has been recognized for some time that gravity behaves in anantithermodynamic \" fashion .",
    "whereas ordinary thermodynamic systems , a gas for example , tend to become more homogenous with time , gravitating systems tend to become more inhomogeneous with time .",
    "the anomalous behavior can be viewed as a manifestation of the long - range nature of the gravitational force , which tends to cause the components of a gravitating system to clump .",
    "if we associate an increase in homogeneity with an increase in entropy for thermodynamic systems , then for gravitating systems an increase in entropy will imply an increase in inhomogeneity .",
    "the  gravitational arrow of time \" points in the direction of increasing inhomogeneity .",
    "there have , apparently , been only a few attempts in the literature to characterize the gravitational arrow of time .",
    "the most well - known is the suggestion of penrose @xcite that  gravitational entropy \" should be measured by @xmath4 , the square of the weyl tensor .",
    "penrose hoped that the weyl tensor would provide a measure of inhomogeneity and increase monotonically in time .",
    "this proposal met with some degree of success with a slight modification @xcite .",
    "however , this `` entropy '' function is not well defined for all spacetimes ; for example conformally flat or vacuum models .",
    "furthermore bonnor @xcite has found an example in which the gravitational arrow points in the opposite sense when compared to the flow of radiation from a collapsing fluid , throwing doubt on the entire proposal .",
    "there have been several other efforts to define the entropy of the gravitational field from various standpoints ( smolin @xcite , hu and kandrup @xcite and brandenberger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but none appear to have established an explicit connection to the hamiltonian formulation of gravity , and none has addressed the arrow - of - time question .",
    "in this paper we attack the problem of gravitational entropy by a direct approach .",
    "the goal is to find a function that behaves like entropy , i.e. that increases monotonically as a gravitating system becomes more inhomogeneous .",
    "we therefore choose a function that resembles entropy as much as possible : @xmath6 here , @xmath5 is gravitational entropy and @xmath1 is the volume of phase space for the system .",
    "( unless stated otherwise , throughout the paper we use units in which @xmath7 ) .    for this choice",
    "we have reverted to the fundamental statistical mechanics definition of entropy . however , although we will refer to particle models , it is absolutely crucial to realize our goal is to characterize the phase space and entropy of the field itself , _ not _ of systems of particles .",
    "there are several advantages and disadvantages to the above definition for gravitational entropy . for thermodynamic systems ,",
    "a direct evaluation of the phase space is extremely difficult , if not impossible .",
    "instead , one chooses the simpler path of evaluating the partition function , @xmath8 , from which the entropy is readily derived as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the mean energy .    here",
    ", however , we encounter the first conceptual difficulty in carrying over the procedure to relativity : to evaluate the partition function requires knowing the temperature of the system . in general relativity",
    "we usually deal with dynamical , not thermodynamic , systems , and a temperature is not well - defined .",
    "a macroscopic pendulum executing simple harmonic motion , for example , constitutes a dynamical , not a thermodynamic system . of course",
    ", one could assign an effective temperature @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pendulum s velocity , but the system is nevertheless not in thermal equilibrium and so the concept of a partition function is not obviously useful .    however ,",
    "a pendulum s motion does define a trajectory in phase space and it can be calculated without recourse to temperature .",
    "this is one of the two main reasons for reverting to the statistical mechanics expression for entropy ( [ s_def ] ) .",
    "the other , anticipating the application to cosmology , is that the phase space approach is intimately connected with hamiltonian dynamics , and a hamiltonian formalism of relativity ( the adm formalism @xcite ) already exists .",
    "now , normally , one is not interested in the absolute value of the entropy , but in the change of entropy with time .",
    "if the above pendulum were given a higher energy , it would include a larger phase space and the logarithm of the area between the two paths would formally resemble an entropy change .",
    "however , neglecting dissipative forces , the pendulum does not change its trajectory .",
    "furthermore , the concept of entropy implies a loss of information , i.e. that we do not know the pendulum s location within this band .",
    "this requires that the system be ergodic , which is not true in the case of the pendulum .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one imagines a system with @xmath14 independent oscillators and assumes that their trajectories are uncorrelated , in other words , that their phases are random , then one should be able to compute an entropy via ( [ s_def ] ) .",
    "thus our approach is basically simple : we calculate the phase space of dynamical systems in relativity , assuming that the trajectories of the components are independent and that consequently each region of phase space is occupied with equal probability .",
    "we then derive an entropy via ( [ s_def ] ) .",
    "( the number of degrees of freedom need not be large as long as the system is chaotic , as in the case of bianchi ix cosmologies . )    usually , one computes the entropy as the logarithm of a volume of phase space constrained by an energy @xmath15 .",
    "our approach , when applied to cosmological models , forces us to substitute the hamltonian @xmath2 for @xmath15 .",
    "this is the most natural and conservative extention of the usual definition but it should be emphasized that @xmath2 does not always correspond to the energy . in most of the systems we consider ,",
    "@xmath2 will be time - dependent , resulting in an entropy change .",
    "the main advantage of the entire method is its conceptual clarity .",
    "the main disadvantage of the procedure is that it is technically cumbersome .",
    "however , we have found a number of systems for which the computation is tractable in the classical , perturbative limit . in these limits",
    "the entropy function does appear to increase or decrease monotonically when appropriate , and by suitable identification of parameters we recover the entropy familiar from a variety of circumstances including , evidently , black holes . in this way the universality of the phase - space concept is established .",
    "extensions to the nonpertubative and quantum limits need to be carried out .    in   [ sec:2pmodel ]  [ sec : near ] of the paper we summarize some preliminary calculations necessary for what follows . in  [ sec : em ] we apply our method to the electromagnetic field . in  [ sec : gwaves ] and  [ sec : density ] we treat gravitational waves and density perturbations . in  [ sec : inverted ] we give a more formal mathematical basis for the results of  [ sec : gwaves ] and  [ sec : density ] .",
    "section [ sec : bianchi ] concerns bianchi ix . in  [ sec : c2 ] we compare our method with penrose s @xmath4 suggestion . in  [ sec : bholes ] we argue that our entropy is indeed the bekenstein - hawking entropy under appropriate circumstances , and in  [ sec : future ] we discuss further applications of our procedure .",
    "we now present a simple model to illustrate the basic approach .",
    "this model describes the newtonian gravitational interaction between two particles , and although it is an extremely idealized particle model , it does highlight several important aspects of our treatment that will remain unchanged in the more complex field models .    consider two particles , each of mass @xmath16 free to slide on a 1-dimensional frictionless track of length @xmath17 with hard  bumpers \" set at the two ends .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is @xmath18 with @xmath19 the factor @xmath20 softens the potential and is introduced to avoid singularities .",
    "the system thus represents two objects that can pass through each other , such as colliding galaxies . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 , is the total energy , which remains constant .",
    "the  air - track \" model is a closed , isolated system and the available phase space can be computed . for two particles ,",
    "however , the system can not be regarded as ergodic and hence an entropy is not really defined . when generalized to @xmath22 particles and three dimensions the system may be regarded as a microcanonical ensemble and the particles",
    "can be assumed to be in random motion and equally likely to be found in any region of phase space . in that case",
    "an entropy would be well - defined .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of a @xmath23 dimensional phase space prohibits analytic solutions ; hence we demonstrate the basic results with just two particles then argue a connection to more general @xmath14-body systems .    for the two - particle case ,",
    "we can write the phase space below energy @xmath24 as @xmath25 note this procedure is similar to evaluating the volume of a 4-sphere , although the exact topology and hence volume will depend on the form of @xmath26 .",
    "generally one defines the acessible region of phase space as a shell between @xmath24 and @xmath27 ; thus @xmath28 .",
    "it is , however , easier to evaluate the full volume @xmath29 , a procedure that we will follow throughout the paper . in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "the two results are identical , since most of the volume of an @xmath14-object resides infinitesimally near the surface .",
    "the first important step in the phase - space procedure is to find the limits of integration , which are not always obvious . due to the quadratic form of the momenta in the hamiltonian ( [ 2p : ham ] ) , the momentum integrals give the volume of a 2-sphere and the limits are set simply by requiring the @xmath30 to be positive definite but constrained by the total energy of the system , as in ( [ 2p : omega ] ) . after evaluating the momentum integrals we have @xmath31 the lower and upper limits on @xmath32",
    "are set by restricting our attention to bound systems , such that @xmath33 and by requiring @xmath34 , which leads to @xmath35 the entire volume of phase space can then be evaluated analytically and is found to be @xmath36 , \\label{omega_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the minimum potential .",
    "note several aspects of this result . for a _ fixed form _ of the potential @xmath26",
    ", there are only two ways to change the phase space : one must change either @xmath24 or @xmath38 . as expected , for a larger @xmath24 ,",
    "the particles are free to roam around in a larger region of phase space and thus @xmath1 increases . were @xmath24 to decrease due to dissipation , the particles",
    "would be confined to a smaller volume .",
    "this is one example of gravitational clumping .",
    "now , to change @xmath38 , one must change @xmath20 , the softening parameter . decreasing @xmath20",
    "makes the potential deeper and vice - versa .",
    "thus , imposing a finite @xmath20 has the effect of excluding a certain region of phase space compared to the usual gravitational potential , in which @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath24 and @xmath20 is shown more explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig:2p_phase ] where we plot phase space trajectories for the two particle system , assuming one particle to be stationary with zero momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 merely determines whether the system is overall bounded . for the behavior of entropy in @xmath14-body systems with constant total energy @xmath24",
    ", @xmath20 is the relevant parameter .",
    "it is @xmath20 that governs the clumping process within a bounded cluster of particles .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 dictates the extent to which particles can form binaries .",
    "this is verified by a number of @xmath14-body simulations which have been performed for scenarios ranging from formation of star clusters to clusters of superclusters @xcite .",
    "invariably , the softening length sets the degree of clumping that is observed : as the softening length @xmath20 is decreased , particles clump tighter and fall deeper into the central high density cores",
    ".    one can relate this behavior to the arrow - of - time question as follows : in n - body codes the softening length and the mesh discretization scale are equivalent insofar as that , below either , no clumping takes place .",
    "( the gravitational force tends to zero and we lose all clumping information . ) hence , by increasing @xmath20 , the universe becomes effectively more homogeneous , and gravitational entropy decreases .",
    "in other words , by changing the mesh size , we change the entropy .",
    "this is an example of  coarse graining . \"",
    "furthermore , in @xmath14-body simulations , some particles migrate to a dense central core at the expense of ejecting a few from the system .",
    "thus , the minimum interparticle separation is a decreasing function of time .",
    "we would then expect the minimum separation to enter into time - dependent limits of the coordinate integrations .",
    "as the separation decreases , the depth of the potential well increases and the phase space also . in terms of the two - particle model , if we associate @xmath20 with the minimum interparticle separation , then as @xmath20 decreases , the absolute value between @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the limits of integration would increase and @xmath1 as well ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2p_phase ] ) .    to sum up",
    ", the  air - track \" model is useful in that it exactly illustrates the calculational procedure we will follow , and by reasonable interpretation of @xmath20 it correctly predicts the behavior of gravitational entropy in @xmath14-body simulations .",
    "consider a 1-dimensional system of @xmath14 simple harmonic oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath43 and potential @xmath44 with the replacement @xmath45 this may be regarded as a 3-dimensional system with n oscillators in each of the @xmath46 directions .",
    "the phase space for this system can be evaluated analytically . with the canonical momenta @xmath47 we have , for any form of potential , @xmath48 with @xmath49 . if we further note that @xmath50 , then each integral is of the form @xmath51^{(n-1)/2 } dx_n = \\ell_n^n \\sqrt{\\pi } \\frac{\\gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})}{\\gamma(\\frac{n+2}{2})}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath52 .",
    "( this integral is the so - called beta function @xcite ) .",
    "the final result after @xmath14 integrations over the momentum variables yields the volume of an @xmath14-sphere of radius @xmath53 and we have for the remaining coordinate integrations @xmath54 where now @xmath55 . in the case of the harmonic oscillator , the @xmath56-integrals are identical in form to the @xmath57-integrals .",
    "hence , one merely continues the procedure another @xmath14 times , and noting that @xmath58 , one gets , finally @xmath59 the same result can be obtained more simply using @xmath14-dimensional spherical coordinates .",
    "however , the method outlined here can be applied to a more general class of potentials .",
    "because eq . ( [ omega_ho ] ) will prove central to much of our analysis , it is worth convincing ourselves that the result is meaningful .",
    "we first note that @xmath1 decreases as @xmath60 increases , in accord with our notion that a stiffer spring constant confines the oscillators to a smaller region of phase space .",
    "note also that @xmath61 .",
    "this behavior is equivalent to that of classical free particles in an infinitely sized box . indeed , by setting @xmath62 in ( [ omega_pi ] ) , performing each @xmath56-integral over the volume of the container and letting @xmath63 , for massive particles",
    ", one can recover the usual expression for the entropy of an ideal gas .    as a further check on eq .",
    "( [ omega_ho ] ) , we point out that if one makes the identification @xmath64 with @xmath65 , then @xmath66 agrees in the classical limit with einstein s formula for the entropy of @xmath14 harmonic oscillators @xmath67 , where @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "finally , the usual definition of phase space is the phase space of a shell around @xmath24 : @xmath69 .",
    "this is given by the differential of ( [ omega_ho ] ) . from this differential",
    "one can derive the partition function @xmath70 although this formula is not found in texts , if one calculates @xmath71 for @xmath14 oscillators with the @xmath72-function approach textbooks apply to free particles @xcite , one arrives at the same result .    with these checks",
    "it appears that eq .",
    "( [ omega_ho ] ) gives a reasonable and meaningful expression for the phase space of n harmonic oscillators .",
    "perhaps the most important ( and useful ) feature of ( [ omega_ho ] ) is that it merely considers the amplitudes of the @xmath73 .",
    "it ignores the phases .",
    "in fact , for its interpretation as phase space we must assume random phases for the oscillators . without this assumption , the motion of the system can not be considered ergodic and the entropy is not defined .",
    "effectively we are regarding the oscillators as a microcanonical ensemble , in which one does not know the exact energy distribution .",
    "however , one could use the definition @xmath74 , which to a high approximation is equivalent to @xmath0 , and apply it to other distributions as well .",
    "the technique used to derive eq .",
    "( [ omega_ho ] ) can be used without modification for other potentials of the form @xmath75 for even powers of @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , as an important application to our analysis , we consider the  nearest - neighbor \" potential with hamiltonian @xmath77 note that the product @xmath78 is a discrete approximation to the gradient @xmath79 ; the spatial scale of the gradient is set by @xmath80 .    with the substitution @xmath81",
    ", the phase space for this nearest neighbor potential can be evaluated in the same way as the harmonic oscillator .",
    "after @xmath14 integrations over the @xmath82 and @xmath14 - 1 integrations over @xmath83 the result is @xmath84    the lower dimensionality of @xmath1 arises from the fact that the last @xmath85 used in deriving ( [ omega_temp ] ) is @xmath86 . the final integration , however , requires one to specify boundary conditions to ensure the dimensionality of momentum space equals that of coordinate space .",
    "a natural choice is periodic boundary conditions , such that @xmath87 , then @xmath88 .",
    "the assumption of periodic boundary conditions adds an extra @xmath89 to the first integral , which can be handled by  completing the square \" and pushing the unwanted terms up to successively higher integrals .",
    "however , a rather tedious calculation shows that , surprisingly , the extra terms vanish after @xmath90 integrations . in other words , @xmath91 .",
    "the dimension has not increased .",
    "one therefore is still required to specify limits on @xmath92 , which we take to be @xmath93 .",
    "then , for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath94 however , we note that one might instead impose `` free - floating '' boundary conditions such that @xmath95 , and merely specify that the limits on @xmath96 are @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the result is the same as ( [ omega_nn ] ) but without the @xmath97 in the denominator .",
    "when logarithms are taken , both results are identical to the harmonic oscillator case except for insignificant numerical factors .",
    "as a sample problem whose technique will carry over to the gravitational case , we now apply these results to the electromagnetic ( em ) field .",
    "because the em field can be modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators , we expect the phase space to reflect eq .",
    "( [ omega_ho ] ) . to show this is the case we assume a constrained hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the electric and magnetic field densities .",

    "( [ h_em ] ) in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath103 , we first discretize @xmath2 as follows : @xmath104 here , the sums are understood to be over the @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 coordinates covering the enclosed volume @xmath108 .",
    "we have also approximated @xmath109 as @xmath110 , with @xmath14 being the number of oscillators in each direction and @xmath111 .",
    "let us further restrict our attention to transverse waves propagating in the @xmath107-direction .",
    "then the @xmath105 and @xmath106 summations can be easily evaluated with the result @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "now , @xmath115 , if @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath117 is the potential density , then @xmath118 hence @xmath119 .    the product of the canonical variables , @xmath120 must equal an action @xmath121 in these units .",
    "consequently , @xmath122 and the proper scaling becomes @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ em_ham ] ) can then be written as @xmath125 where @xmath126 .    to evaluate the phase space below this hamiltonian",
    ", we note that for transverse waves , @xmath127 ; @xmath128 ; and @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the propagation vector .",

    "we see that in this approximation , @xmath26 is just given by the nearest - neighbor potential , calculated in  [ sec : near ] , with the phase space given by eq .",

    "( [ omega_nn ] ) yields @xmath136 for the interpretation of @xmath1 as phase space we need to assume the phases of the electromagnetic waves are random , which merely means the source is incoherent .",
    "this is , in fact , the general case .    a closed solution to the problem requires an evaluation of @xmath14 , the number of oscillators .",
    "because we are primarily interested in the time dependence of @xmath1 ( which is here time independent ) , it is enough to know that @xmath14 is finite ; in the quantum limit it will be the number of photons .    to make contact , however , with the usual expression for the entropy of electromagnetic radiation , we imagine transverse waves in a three- dimensional box , assuming each direction is independent .",
    "the phase space for that system is obtained by letting @xmath45 in the above equation .",

    "the energy of most photons is of order @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the wave vector . in three dimensions ,",
    "the number of states is proportional to the volume in @xmath144 space for a sphere of radius @xmath145 .",
    "the mean number of photons at a temperature @xmath142 is thus proportional to @xmath146 , and we recover the usual scaling for the entropy @xmath147 .",
    "we also point out that ( [ v_a ] ) gives some insight into the question of coarse graining .",
    "the concept of entropy is subjective in the sense that to calculate an entropy requires that an averaging procedure be selected . if one regards the coupling constant in ( [ v_a ] ) to be @xmath148 , where @xmath17 is an arbitrary length scale , then by increasing @xmath17 , one increases the volume per oscillator and hence increases the phase space , as can be seen from ( [ omega_em ] ) .",
    "therefore the coarse graining scale evidently appears in these calculations as the coupling constant .",

    "in fact , it is interesting to note that to this order the time dependence is identical to that found for the corresponding hamiltonian ( [ h_dust ] ) , ie . @xmath385 and @xmath386 for the growing and decaying modes respectively .",
    "the generalization to nonflat spacetimes is rather complicated and not qualitatively different from the flat case , so we do not include it here .",
    "however , we do compute the weyl tensor for spacetimes of the form ( [ metric_gw ] ) , containing singly polarized ( + ) small amplitude gravitational waves propagating in an expanding universe . in this case",
    "@xmath387 noting that @xmath388 , to zero perturbative order , is the same as for the metric ( [ metric_dens ] ) , we again find that @xmath4 alone does not produce the right monotonic behavior , but @xmath389 does . to evaluate the latter , we assume the expansion of the universe is governed by density perturbations and that the scale factor evolves as @xmath168 . for superhorizon scales , @xmath184",
    ", we may ignore spatial gradients so that only the last term in eq .",
    "( [ c2r2_gw ] ) survives . then @xmath390 . in the limit @xmath185 , only the first term survives and @xmath391 oscillates at nearly constant amplitude .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the subhorizon perturbations evolve similarly to the hamiltonian ( [ h_dust ] ) , ie . with constant amplitude .",
    "the superhorizon evolutions , on the other hand , differ from the hamiltonian time dependence .",
    "superhorizon perturbations are coupled to the backgound expansion and , in this case , the expansion is driven by density perturbations .",
    "so it is not surprising to find a scaling @xmath392 similar to that of decaying density perturbations .",
    "finally we present results for the bianchi type ix metric ( [ typeix_metric ] ) , although due to the complexity of the weyl tensor , we do not write out @xmath4 here . because bianchi ix is a vacuum solution with @xmath393 ,",
    "we compute only @xmath394 , shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ix_c2 ] using the same initial data as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ix_phase ] . for comparison",
    ", we also show @xmath395 ( introduced to bring out the structure at the scale of variations in @xmath394 ) .",
    "notice that although @xmath4 oscillates ( the kinks evident in @xmath394 , and which correlate with the peaks in @xmath1 , are points where @xmath4 becomes negative ) , the absolute magnitude diverges exponentially as the singularity is approached .",
    "the rate of divergence can be estimated from the `` free fall '' part of the trajectories during which @xmath396 , and the dominant terms in the square of the weyl tensor scale as @xmath397 for @xmath398 .",
    "the above results continue to throw doubt on the utility of the @xmath4 definition of entropy .",
    "indeed , the simple @xmath4 measure seems to be again ruled out because of its inability to handle both the decaying and growing modes in a sensible fashion .",
    "our results also point to important differences between the phase space and @xmath4 measures of entropy , as well as several other functions one might consider . as can be seen from above",
    ", @xmath4 is a local quantity , which will vary from point to point . as such it is not a useful measure of the global properties of spacetime , unless some sort of spatial average is introduced . by the same token , even though they are gauge invariant to first order , one can rule out the metric perturbations @xmath204 and @xmath156 for the density and gravitational wave perturbations .",
    "these are also local quantities .",
    "the hamiltonian in our examples could be considered on its own to be a measure of inhomogeneity since it is summed over the spatial coordinates and has a sensible time dependence . in regard to monotonicity in the time dependence , @xmath1 appears to offer no advantages over @xmath2 ( except perhaps in the case of bianchi ix , where we found that along the plateaus of constant @xmath2 , @xmath1 increased in the direction of increasing anisotropy ) .",
    "however , @xmath2 alone does not provide a statistical description of a system in that it can be changed by the addition of an arbitrary phase .",
    "@xmath1 , on the other hand is a truly global quantity that expresses the entire allowable dynamical range equally for each of the oscillators in the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "it is not restricted to a particular phase realization , unlike any combination of variables constructed from metric components , which is .",
    "@xmath1 thus presents the advantage over @xmath4 , @xmath2 or any single solution to the differential equations in that it is global , shows a sensible time dependence and reduces to familiar entropy under appropriate circumstances .",
    "this is apparently true even in one area we have not yet addressed .",
    "one of the questions one naturally wishes to answer is whether the entropy we have defined results in the well - known entropy of black holes . to establish the connection would strengthen any claim that the entropy function of this paper is in fact entropy .",
    "we now give a bekenstein - style argument @xcite that the logarithm of the phase space does reduce to the entropy of black holes in the appropriate circumstance .",
    "the argument resembles the one we gave in ",
    "[ sec : em ] for the em field and is also somewhat similar to one found in zurek and thorne @xcite ; we have , however , not seen this demonstration elsewhere .    in ",
    "[ sec : harm ] we showed that the phase space of harmonic oscillators , eq .",
    "( [ omega_ho ] ) , gives the classical limit for einstein s formula and results in a reasonable expression for the entropy of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this phase space was , with a slight change in notation , @xmath399 where @xmath400 is the angular frequency .",
    "suppose we wish to construct a black hole out of photons , i.e. , quantum oscillators . to do this",
    ", we must squeeze the oscillator system to within a schwarzschild volume and the total energy of the oscillator system should equal @xmath401 , the mass of the black hole .",
    "the latter condition implies that @xmath402 , where @xmath269 is the average energy of an oscillator .",
    "we also have @xmath403 , where @xmath60 is the wavelength of the photon the minimum energy per oscillator needed to construct the hole corresponds to the longest allowed wavelength , which should be of order the schwarzschild diameter , or @xmath404 .",
    "let us , however , parameterize the wavelength as @xmath405 .",
    "hence @xmath406 and @xmath407    with the above expression for @xmath14 , @xmath408 and stirling s formula , we quickly find by taking the logarithm of ( [ omega_ho2 ] ) that @xmath409 the exact value of @xmath5 therefore depends on @xmath410 .",
    "_ a priori _ , we expect @xmath411 or @xmath412 . however , if @xmath413 , the uncertainty relationship implies that @xmath60 may be as large as @xmath414 . in the former case",
    "we are a factor of @xmath415 lower than the bekenstein - hawking@xcite value of @xmath416 , in the latter case a factor of @xmath417 lower . alternatively , if one chooses @xmath418 where the black - hole temperature @xmath419 @xcite , one recovers the exact result @xmath420 .    one might object that we have basically given a dimensional argument . nevertheless , that the phase space of harmonic oscillators comes so close to the accepted result is striking .",
    "with hindsight , the phase - space approach makes clear that @xmath421 , so black - hole entropy must be of order @xmath422 . a hamiltonian modified for quantum mechanical systems would , we expect , reproduce the usual result . note , however , that unlike the cosmological models we have considered , the hamiltonian here is not the adm hamiltonian for the black hole itself .",
    "the hamiltonian for the schwarzschild metric would presumably result in zero entropy since the canonical momenta are zero in the static case .",
    "thus the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian must be regarded either as perturbations on the background or as the hamiltonian for the infalling oscillators ; this latter corresponds to the usual approach for calculating black - hole entropy .",
    "we will explore these matters further and attempt a quantum mechanical calculation in a future paper .",
    "as it stands our current result shows that black - hole entropy can be treated profitably as a classical quantity .",
    "we also emphasize that , in contrast to the cosmological case , the black - hole hamiltonian is easily interpreted as the energy and it is constant ; the resulting phase space should then be the usual one .",
    "the main leap , evidently , in accepting the function we have termed gravitational entropy as genuine entropy lies not in the classical treatment , but in the use of time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "we have evaluated the phase space for a number of models in the perturbative limit under the assumptions that : 1 ) the phases of the various components can be ignored ; 2 ) that the system can be defined on spacelike hypersurfaces with some prescription for choosing boundaries ; 3 ) the system is constrained by a hamiltonian on each hypersurface . under these assumptions @xmath3 appears to be a reasonable entropy function in that it increases with increasing inhomogeneity and not otherwise . because the phase space for the perturbative spacetimes we have considered is computed using gauge invariant functions , entropy as we have defined it is thus also gauge invariant to first order .",
    "moreover , it can be identified with the entropy of more familiar situations .",
    "we also point out that the generalized second law of thermodynamics appears to be automatically satisfied .",
    "the generalized second law states that the sum of the thermodynamic and gravitational entropies in a closed , isolated system should always increase . unless for some reason an increase in gravitational entropy actually causes a decrease in thermodynamic entropy",
    ", the generalized second law should not be violated .",
    "( for some time this was not obvious in the black hole case , in which the hole _ can _ decrease the surrounding entropy ( at the expense of increasing its surface area . )",
    "however , since our entropy becomes black hole entropy , this situation is evidently taken care of . ) a more detailed investigation of this question may be warranted .",
    "full , nonperturbative adm calculations for inhomogeneous model systems would also be desirable .",
    "one system to examine is spherically symmetric collapse .",
    "however , in this case ( as in classical orbital problems ) the canonical coordinates and momenta appear to be coupled , making it difficult to perform the integrations .",
    "if the system is tractable , it may be possible to get black hole entropy by calculating the phase space available to a collapsing star or dust shells .",
    "these are a few problems we hope to examine in future work .",
    "the phase space approach is a generic one , applicable to a wide range of systems , including dust , radiation , @xmath423body simulations , newtonian and relativistic problems .",
    "hence , the cases we have mentioned are probably only a small subset of those that can be examined .",
    "the more important message is that a consideration of the phase space available to general - relativistic systems appears to open a direct connection to statistical mechanics .",
    "this connection is well worth investigating .",
    "t.r . wishes to thank g.f.r .",
    "ellis for his suggestion and great encouragement to work on the problem of gravitational entropy .",
    "he is also grateful to richard matzner and the members of the center for relativity for their hospitality during the early stages of this work .",
