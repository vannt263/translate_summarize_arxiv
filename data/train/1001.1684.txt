    "the formation of envelope solitons , through the nonlinear interaction of high - frequency ( hf ) electric fields and low - frequency ( lf ) ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) is one of the most interesting features , and is extensively studied problem in the context of turbulence in modern plasma physics .",
    "formation of these structures not only plays a role in turbulence , but also for plasma heating , particle transport etc . , and so their properties are of fundamental interest . in plasmas ,",
    "such envelope solitons are well - known langmuir solitons that are hf langmuir waves ( lws ) trapped by the density troughs associated with lf iaws ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . during the past few years",
    "several attempts have been made to investigate the dynamics of solitons including dressed solitons @xcite , soliton collapse @xcite , nucleation of cavitons @xcite , radiation of langmuir solitons @xcite , landau damping in partially incoherent lws @xcite etc .",
    "an experimental observation for the excitation of iaws has also been reported in a langmuir turbulence regime by prado _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , an increasing interest has also been found to study the langmuir turbulence as a result of chaos @xcite .",
    "when the electric field intensity is strong enough to reach the modified decay instability threshold , the interaction between lws and iaws results to ` weak turbulence ' , and then the lws are scattered off iaws under @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electron ( ion ) temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "when the field intensity is so strong that the modulational instability ( mi ) threshold is exceeded , the lws are then essentially trapped by the density cavities associated with iaws .",
    "such phenomenon can occur frequently in plasmas .",
    "the interaction is then said to be in a ` strong turbulence ' regime , in which transfer or redistribution of energy to higher harmonic modes with small wavelengths may be possible .",
    "in general , it is believed that some sort of chaotic process may be responsible for the energy transfer from large to small spatial scales @xcite .",
    "this energy transfer may become faster when the chaotic process is well developed in a subsystem of the full set of equations @xcite .",
    "one of the most important models in this context is the so - called zakharov equations ( zes ) @xcite , which have been derived by assuming a quasineutrality as well as neglecting the ion - wave nonlinearity ( iwn ) due to density fluctuation .",
    "however , the effects of dispersion due to charge separation ( deviation from the quasineutrality ) may be important in the radiation of iaws , i.e. , when the lws  resonantly interact with iaws at the same speed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when wave amplitude becomes relatively large , the iwn can be important in the enhancement of ion - acoustic wave emission as well as in the excitation of many unstable harmonic modes at the initial stage of interaction , which later turns out to spatiotemporal chaos ( stc ) .",
    "the basic purpose of this work is to investigate numerically the dynamics of coupled lws and iaws in presence of these important effects , and also to modify the results of langmuir solitons not observed in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) zes .",
    "we show that transfer of energy to fewer modes , indeed , occurs and it is faster when the chaotic process in a low - dimensional model of the full system is well developed by the iwn .",
    "such low - dimensional model is constructed on the basis of three unstable harmonic modes @xcite , and which depends on a particular regime of the wave number of excitation .",
    "numerical simulation of this low - dimensional model reveals that transition from order to chaos is possible , when the largest length scale of the iaws is greater than that of the soliton characteristic size .",
    "solitons will then much be distorted by the iaw emission until a mostly chaotic state emerges . for details of the idea of constructing such model ,",
    "readers are referred to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the low - dimensional model is restricted to a few number of modes , and also it is valid for a certain vale of the wave number of excitation , one needs to investigate , e.g. , numerically the the full space - time problem , especially when this wave number is small enough to excite many unstable modes .",
    "we show that these solitary patterns , thus formed , ultimate lose their strengths after a long time through the  random collision and fusion under the strong iaw emission .",
    "the stc state of the system is then said to emerge . however , the mechanism leading to such stc  is still not clear .",
    "a few works in this direction can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the governing equations , and analyze the evolution of langmuir solitons in some particular cases of interest . a low - dimensional three - wave model is formed and its linear stability analysis is carried out in sec .",
    "numerical results for the temporal evolution of the low - dimensional model and the spatiotemporal evolution of the full system are presented in sec .",
    "iv and sec .",
    "v respectively .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi contains some discussion and conclusion .",
    "the nonlinear interaction of hf lws and lf iaws is governed by the following coupled set  of equations @xcite @xmath2@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the slowly varying langmuir wave electric field normalized by @xmath5 with @xmath6 denoting the equilibrium number density , @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 is the square root of the electron - ion mass ratio and @xmath9 is the plasma relative density fluctuation .",
    "the time @xmath10 is normalized by the ion plasma period @xmath11 and the space @xmath12 by the electron debye radius @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) the terms with fourth - order mixed derivatives describe the effects due to charge separation ( i.e. , deviation from the quasineutrality ) .",
    "the third and fourth terms in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) arise due to the expansion of @xmath14  up to the second order of @xmath15 in the equation for lf perturbation of electrons@xmath16 this enforces us to assume that the relative density fluctuation associated with iaws is not so small@xmath16    we note that the analytic treatment of the eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) without iwn has been studied in detail for the modification of langmuir solitons by karpman _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "however , when the iwn is included in the system , the soliton properties may be changed .  to look for this effect",
    ", we simply disregard the mixed derivatives , and solve numerically the system of eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) by runge - kutta scheme . in the scheme ,",
    "we approximate the spatial derivatives by the centered second - order difference formulas , and use @xmath17 at the boundaries@xmath16 the results are presented in fig.1 . when the ion - acoustic radiation is weak , we see that around @xmath18 the ponderomotive force dominates over the iwn , giving rise an increased amplitude of the envelope ( highly correlated with the density depletion )",
    ". however , in the other regimes of @xmath12 , iwn dominates and makes the solitons wider .",
    "later , we will see that as time progresses , the iaw emission increases by the iwn , causing solitons to lose their strengths .    .",
    "the solid and dashed ( red ) lines respectively correspond to the case with iwn and without iwn after @xmath19.,width=336,height=336 ]    some particular cases can be of interest in the context of langmuir solitons .",
    "for example , under the small amplitude condition , i.e. , disregarding the third  and fourth terms in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , and assuming the quasineutrality ( disregarding the mixed fourth order derivatives ) , the dynamics of small amplitude iaws are then governed by @xmath20 this equation when coupled with eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) describes under suitable renormalizations the classical zes @xcite , which has been extensively studied in the context of langmuir wave turbulence ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "again , assuming a slow space - time response to the perturbations as @xmath21 i.e. , ion perturbations move with the ion - acoustic speed , @xmath22 , and asuming  the dependent variables to vary@xmath23  the iaws can be described by the following modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation @xcite @xmath24 the equation ( [ e1 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) describe the dynamics of slowly varying langmuir wave electric field coupled to the slow response of the density perturbations .",
    "these coupled equations predict a class of solutions with a bell - shaped langmuir wave electric field profile arrested into the density cavity @xcite .",
    "we now turn out to the global behaviors of the system . to this end , we first renormalize the original variables ( similar to the zes ) as @xmath25 and obtain the condition for mi as given below .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) reduce to @xmath26@xmath27 clearly , the term proportional to @xmath28 becomes smaller and can be neglected .",
    "however , the terms proportional to @xmath29 can no longer be neglected when the soliton attenuation becomes relatively larger .",
    "next , the linear stability analysis of the perturbations @xmath30 @xmath31 [ where @xmath32 @xmath33 is the wave number ( frequency ) of modulation ] for eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) gives the following growth rate of mi .",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 and the mi sets in for @xmath32 satisfying @xmath36",
    "we note that the system of eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) is , in general , multi - dimensional .",
    "however , there may be the situation in which a few number of modes is more active than the remaining modes .",
    "such cases are quite typical not only for langmuir wave turbulence , but are rather general for parametric instabilities of hf waves interacting with lf ones close to the instability threshold .  in this way ,",
    "galerkin expansions and truncations to a few normal modes are commonly used to describe the basic features of the full dynamics by a low - dimensional model .",
    "however , we will see that the specific details of such model are highly dependent on the range for the basic wave number of modulation @xmath32 .",

    "this results a system of odes [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq15])-([e18 ] ) ] describing the temporal dynamics of the field variables .",
    "notice , however , that although the fourier modes are truncated , no assumption on the slowness of the dynamics is made .",
    "we would like to see how the temporal system behaves as @xmath32 approaches @xmath106 from @xmath101 and the condition for the subsonic region is progressively relaxed by reducing @xmath32 from @xmath107 to some extent@xmath16 here @xmath32 is not so small that the three - wave model becomes inappropriate , because smaller the @xmath32 , the larger is the number of unstable modes . in the latter case , full simulation of eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) will be necessary to give more appropriate information about the interaction .",

    "the  latter are established by the lyapunov analysis with at least one positive exponent indicating chaos .  on the other hand ,",
    "the regular or limit cycles may be described on the basis of their structures , amplitude oscillations with time or lyapunov exponents with negative or zero values .    for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 in @xmath113 fig .",
    "3 shows a periodic limit cycle .",
    "this suggests that within the plane wave region , strong chaotic activity is completely absent , i.e. , most of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) surfaces , especially the central fixed point remains unaffected by the nonlinear interaction .",
    "in fact , the absence of chaos is not only for these parameter values , but also for some other values smaller or larger .",
    "it also explains that within this  plane wave region no massive redistribution of energy takes place",
    ". this information well agrees with the full simulation of the space - time problem @xcite .  as @xmath32 is lowered from @xmath107 , e.g. , @xmath114 , fig .",
    "4 * * shows that the periodicity or integrability of the temporal system tends to become poorer exhibiting chaotic orbits .",
    "this can be verified by the set of corresponding lyapunov exponents as shown in fig . 5 , where one positive exponent indicates chaos .",
    "we  also find that as @xmath32 becomes smaller , the largest lyapunov tends to increase from a positive small value to a large one @xmath97 .",
    "so , it may be possible that as the basic wave number @xmath32  is decreased further , strong chaotic features develop into the system .     and",

    "this is expected , since for smaller @xmath32 , the solitons get more affected by the ion - acoustic radiation until they are completely destroyed . in the strong chaotic process",
    "one can expect that solitons will deliver their energy to the remaining modes so as to gradually  disappear after some time .",
    "however , one can no longer rely on the low - dimensional model for some smaller values of @xmath32 , as it gives rise an excitation of large number of unstable harmonic modes .",
    "this is the situation where full simulation of eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) will give better understanding for the interaction .",
    "in addition to the above results , one interesting can also be to study the existence of hopf - bifurcation in the eqs .",
    "( [ eq15])-([e18 ] ) by choosing @xmath32 as the bifurcation parameter .",
    "generally , hopf - bifurcation is defined as the change in qualitative behavior of the system when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues passes through the imaginary axis .",
    "a pair of such roots can be obtained by numerically examining the eigenvalue equation ( [ e23 ] ) .",
    "thus , one can perform a series of analysis with different values of @xmath32 .",
    "figure 6 shows the supercritical diagram corresponding to @xmath116 and @xmath117 in which an attracting periodic orbit bifurcates .",
    "the detailed analysis of such bifurcation is , however , beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in the previous section we have observed that as the value of @xmath32 is lowered from @xmath101 the system exhibits strong chaotic features .",
    "so , in order to investigate the global behaviors of the solitons , namely the soliton interaction with strong iaw emission , formation of incoherent patterns due to collision and fusion , it is reasonable to consider the system of eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) without the mixed derivatives ( valid for long - wavelengths ) . in our numerical scheme ,",

    "we observe from figs . 9 and 10 * * ( contour plot corresponding to fig .",

    "<S> the space - time evolution of the coupled lws and iaws shows that the iwn can cause the excitation of many unstable harmonic modes , and can lead to strong iaw emission . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs when the initial wave field is relatively large or the length scale of iaws is larger than the soliton characteristic size . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulation also reveals that many solitary patterns can be excited and generated through the modulational instability ( mi ) of unstable harmonic modes .  </S>",
    "<S> as time goes on , these solitons are seen to appear in the spatially partial coherence ( spc ) state due to the free ion - acoustic radiation as well as in the state of spatiotemporal chaos ( stc ) due to collision and fusion in the stochastic motion . </S>",
    "<S> the latter results the redistribution of initial wave energy into a few modes with small length scales , which may lead to the onset of langmuir turbulence in laboratory as well as space plasmas . </S>"
