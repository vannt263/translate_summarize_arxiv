    "real - time ( rt ) time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) is an efficient _ ab initio _ method to study electronic dynamics in complex electron - nuclear systems , especially for those in the electronically excited states . compared with other widely used approaches such as frequency domain tddft , quasi - particle gw and bethe - salpeter equations",
    ", rt - tddft has two major advantages : ( i ) time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equations in rt - tddft include all nonlinear effects and are intrinsically non - perturbative , making rt - tddft a better tool to describe materials in strong field ; ( ii ) rt - tddft directly provides real time evolution of electronic wavefunctions together with ionic movements , presenting a unique way for the real - time tracking of ultrafast dynamics and phenomena far from equilibrium .",
    "thus , rt - tddft is a natural choice for the exploration of strong field physics and ultrafast phenomena .",
    "motivated by the rapid developments in above fields , rt - tddft is drawing more and more attentions .",
    "nevertheless , rt - tddft is not widely used as the method of choice in literature , being much less popular than other density functional theory ( dft ) based approaches such as @xmath0scf , dft+u , frequency - domain tddft , etc .",
    "the major reasons responsible for this fact is the limited functionality in most rt - tddft approaches and challenging computational consumption .",
    "most previous rt - tddft investigations focus on the photoabsorption and related properties of finite size zero - dimensional ( 0d ) systems ( atoms / molecules / nanoparticles ) including the strong field optical spectra  @xcite , photochemical stability  @xcite , and recently plasmonic excitations  @xcite . in 0d systems ,",
    "only single @xmath1 point is needed in the reciprocal space sampling .",
    "thus , @xmath2-only algorithm is overwhelmingly common implemented and used in rt - tddft simulations .",
    "however , to study photoexcitation and electronic dynamics in extended systems , @xmath2-only is insufficient and momentum - resolved ( @xmath3-resolved ) sampling in the reciprocal space is needed .",
    "another advantages of using @xmath3-resolved rt - tddft is computational efficiency . with @xmath2-only tddft , to get the accurate charge density and ionic forces , an extraordinary large supercell has to be invoked .",
    "many previous studies on extended systems belong to this scenario  @xcite , including our recent works about ultrafast electron - hole dynamics in dye - sensitized solar cells  @xcite and nonthermal melting of silicon  @xcite .",
    "using @xmath3-resolved algorithms , and at the same accuracy level , the supercell size as well as the computational cost , can be largely reduced .",
    "besides technical advantages , @xmath3-resolved algorithm introduces the important k - space resolution and a new degree of freedom , which is essential to describe key quantities and important physics in condensed matter and materials such as band structures , quasiparticles , and valley dynamics . only rt - tddft with @xmath3-resolved sampling",
    "can provide essential information concerning their real time evolution .    in literature @xmath3-resolved",
    "rt - tddft algorithms have been implemented by several groups  @xcite and applied for both semiconductors  @xcite and metals  @xcite .",
    "these implementations employ either real space grids or all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - planewaves as basis sets .",
    "on the other hand , numerical atomic orbitals ( nao ) have been an common choice to dramatically reduce computation cost for complex systems , and have been widely used in dft codes .",
    "the biggest advantage of using nao is the extremely small computational cost . to describe a system with @xmath4 atoms , only about @xmath5 naos",
    "are required , while @xmath6 to @xmath7 real space grids or plane waves have to be used .",
    "in addition , with a relatively small real - space cutoff for naos , the order-@xmath8 linear scaling with respect to system size can be achieved . since a major difficulty in developing rt - tddft is its extreme time consumption due to the use of ultrasmall time step ( on the order of @xmath91 attosecond ) , nao based @xmath3-resolved rt - tddft is very promising for simulating more realistic complex condensed matter materials and interfaces with a longer simulation time",
    ". however , to take the advantages of naos , new and more complicated framework and implementation in rt - tddft is unavoidable .    in this work",
    "we stride to tackle above major challenges in rt - tddft .",
    "we have developed the @xmath3-resolved rt - tddft algorithm based on local basis sets using numerical atomic orbitals .",
    "this approach enables rt - tddft calculations of solids and surfaces using a small unit cell , reducing computational cost by several order of magnitudes ( 1/100 ) . moreover , momentum - resolved excitation dynamics in model systems are observed .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 selective photoexcitation in graphene has been observed , where three distinct photoexcitation modes located at different k were induced upon laser illumination .",
    "this kind of k dependent electronic dynamics are ubiquitous in solids .",
    "therefore , we expect highly efficient @xmath3-resolved rt - tddft algorithms employing local bases is an important development and will be widely used in ultrafast research and optimal control of quantum materials .",
    "the main framework of @xmath3-resolved rt - tddft algorithm is inherited from an earlier single-@xmath1 version of time dependent _ ab initio _ package ( tdap )  @xcite , which is based on the siesta  @xcite package .",
    "in such a rt - tddft algorithm , the flowchart of a given ionic step is shown in fig .",
    "[ flowchart ] .",
    "each process is described in detail in the following sections , marked with the same labels as in fig .",
    "[ flowchart ] .",
    "atomic units @xmath10 are used throughout this work .",
    "flowchart of @xmath3-resolved algorithm . ]      occupying the periodical boundary condition , the lattice vectors are denoted as @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and the atoms @xmath13 in the unit cell located at positions @xmath14 , where @xmath8 is truncated to a finite supercell .",
    "a set of numerical atomic - centered orbitals ( naos ) @xmath15 is associated with each atom , where @xmath16 denotes both the orbital and angular quantum numbers of the atomic state , together with the multiple radial basis function @xmath17  @xcite . here ,",
    "since all the operators and functions are time - dependent , we only denote the explicit dependence on @xmath18 as @xmath19 and omit @xmath18 for the implicit dependence .",
    "overlap matrix @xmath20 and hamiltonian @xmath21 at the each @xmath3 point are expressed with naos : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian _ operator _ , where @xmath25 is the kinetic energy operator , i is the atom index , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the local and kleinman - bylander parts of the pseduopotential of atom i , @xmath28 is the hartree potential , @xmath29 is the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential and @xmath30 is the potential of external electric field .",
    "details in the calculation of @xmath31 are described in ref .",
    "@xcite . occupying adiabatic lda / gga approximation  @xcite , @xmath29",
    "does not depend explicitly on time @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath32 = v^{xc}[\\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)]$ ] .",
    "thus , most dft xc functionals such as perdew - wang  @xcite , perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite , becke - lee - yang - parr  @xcite , and van der waals density functional  @xcite are compatible in our rt - tddft implementation .    to simulate a laser - material interaction , the time - dependent electric field @xmath33",
    "is introduced to @xmath34 in length gauge as : @xmath35 time dependent @xmath33 can be tuned as any shape in time .",
    "an example is a gaussian wave package @xmath36\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the frequency , @xmath38 is the peak time , and @xmath39 is the auxiliary phase .",
    "we note that , the transitional symmetry of hamiltonian is broken by finite @xmath40 , since @xmath41 thus , a common solution is using a sawtooth field along spatial direction @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the length of unit cell along @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 , it requires that charge density vanishes @xmath48 in area @xmath49 , otherwise the energy diverges .",
    "thus , a vacuum layer is essential along @xmath45",
    ". it limits the application of this method .",
    "dynamical electric field in vector gauge removes the requirement of the vacuum layer .",
    "this method will be implemented and discussed in our following work .      with td hamiltonian and overlap matrix , tdks equation",
    "is solved to obtain @xmath50 from the state @xmath50 at the previous time step : @xmath51 \\ket{u_{n\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r } , t_1)}.\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the length of time step , @xmath50 is bloch function and @xmath53 .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate @xmath54 and @xmath55 directly . because @xmath56 is quite small ( @xmath57  fs ) , the ion positions barely changes from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath60 is only determined by ionic positions ( eq .  ( [ sk ] ) ) , it is accurate enough to occupy @xmath61 .",
    "however , @xmath62 may largely change due to the rapid evolution of electrons . to approaching @xmath54 , two options are available : @xmath63 or @xmath64 eq  [ lasttimeh ] is more convenient to implement while eq .",
    "( [ middletimeh ] ) is more accurate .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , hamiltonian elements change approximately linearly within @xmath65  fs .",
    "thus , with the @xmath66  fs , @xmath67 is a better evaluation of @xmath68 than @xmath69 . in practice , these two scenarios yield almost the same results .    note that , @xmath70 is not explicitly dependent on the other tdks orbitals @xmath71 ( @xmath72 or @xmath73 ) , which is the @xmath74-representativity of the tdks equation  @xcite .",
    "it decouples the evolution equations of different tdks orbitals and make the tddft calculation practically possible .",
    "however , it still includes the interband scattering .",
    "because @xmath21 is determined by the charge density , which is a weighted summation of all the occupied orbitals , there still exists a coupling between the orbitals .",
    "numerally , propagator @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) is expanded using first - order crank - nicholson scheme : @xmath76    technically , calculation of eq .",
    "( [ crank - nicholson ] ) is accelerated in two aspects : firstly , scalapack is used for the parallel matrix inversion and multiplication .",
    "secondly , since computing @xmath77 is most time - consuming part , we minimize the times of its computing .",
    "@xmath77 is only updated when nao positions @xmath14 are changed .",
    "thus , when ions are fixed , @xmath77 is computed only once at the first ionic step .",
    "even with ions moving , @xmath78 only need to be updated once for each ionic step .      with @xmath79 solved in eq .  ( [ evolution ] ) ,",
    "the density matrix ( dm ) @xmath80 is computed accordingly as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the electronic population of the band @xmath83 at @xmath3 , and @xmath84 is the coefficient of @xmath85 in nao basis : @xmath86      we use the self - consistence process described in ref .",
    "this process substantially increases the numerical stability  @xcite .",
    "all the criteria for convergence test developed in siesta are compatible , such as the maximum element of the dm difference , the energy difference , the harris energy difference etc  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we use dm difference as an example , convergence is reached when @xmath87 where @xmath88 is about 10@xmath89 .",
    "if not converged , the linear mixing of dm is needed to generate the input dm for the next cycle @xmath90 , instead of using @xmath91 directly : @xmath92 where the @xmath93 is the input dm and @xmath91 is the output dm , @xmath94 is the mixing weight , usually @xmath95 .",
    "if self - consistence process is converged , the post - processes are evoked , such as the calculations of total energy , hellmann - feynman forces , ionic movements .",
    "these functions are implemented in siesta  @xcite and compatibly used in tdap  @xcite .",
    "here we only the introduce some unique analysis , among which an important one is the state - to - state transition probabilities  @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the adiabatic basis @xmath98 the population @xmath99 of adiabatic state @xmath100 is thus projected from tdks orbitals as : @xmath101 @xmath102 is occupied state at @xmath3 point .    _ technically , @xmath83 loops over all adiabatic states , which has the dimension @xmath103 , where @xmath103 is the number of naos .",
    "thus , the calculation is @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of occupied tdks states .",
    "this calculation is quite time consuming .",
    "parallel computation is essential : firstly , diagonalization of @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ adiabaticbasis ] ) is carried using scalapack and broadcast all @xmath106 to all nodes .",
    "secondly , the occupied tdks orbitals @xmath107 are distributed equally by all the computing nodes .",

    "to demonstrate the @xmath3-resolved algorithm , we choose graphene as the model system [ fig .  [ struct](a ) ] .",

    "these different behaviors are due to different exciton energies of three modes .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath202 mode is analogue to the wave beat : @xmath203 for k@xmath200 mode , @xmath204 is the energy difference between excitation outgoing and ingoing state and @xmath205 is the photon energy .",
    "beat frequency @xmath206  fs , which is close to the oscillation periodicity @xmath207 .",
