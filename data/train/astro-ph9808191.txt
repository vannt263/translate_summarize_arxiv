    "gamma - ray bursts are characterized by a high variability .",
    "their duration varies from milliseconds to minutes ( norris et al.1996 ) .",
    "the cosmological distances at which the bursts occur indicates that the total energy generated ( assuming isotropy ) must be at least @xmath0 ergs .",
    "the rapid rise in luminosity and the variability on short time scales suggest that the radiation is generated in a region of the size of the order of a hundred kilometers ( a few light milliseconds ) .",
    "the long duration of some bursts indicates that the energy generation within this region has a rather long time scale .",
    "the brightest gamma - ray bursts are time asymmetric ( nemiroff et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the complex temporal structure of the energy release reflects the activity of a highly variable inner engine ( fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; sari & piran 1997 ; kobayashi et al.1997 ) .",
    "short millisecond gamma - ray bursts consist of a single fast rise and exponential or power - law decay where longer ( seconds to minutes ) bursts often show multiple events separated by short time intervals .",
    "these temporal structures are not understood .",
    "explanations range from multiple shock fronts running into an ambient medium ( sari et al.1996 ) , expanding shells with brighter patches and dimmer regions ( fenimore et al.1996 ) to repeated series of pulses with gaussian or power - law profiles ( norris et al.1996 ) .",
    "a clear physical explanation lacks and the geometry is not at all clear .",
    "combinations of hydrodynamic , deteriation , expansion and dilation time scales are introduced without a clear physical explanation or understanding .",
    "popular models for gamma - ray bursts range from coalescing neutron - star binaries ( @xcite ) , compact objects merging with the central massive black hole of a galaxy ( ) collapse of a magnetized white dwarf to a neutron star ( yu & blackman 1997 ) to hyper novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "all these models have great difficulty explaining the duration ( @xcite ) and the intrinsic variability ( fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; sari & piran 1997 ) of the burst .",
    "roland et al.(1994 ) proposed that the light curves of extra galactic gamma - ray bursts can be explained with beamed emission from a precessing accretion disc around a @xmath1 to @xmath2black hole .",
    "this model was not worked out in greater detail because it was expected to produce time symmetric light curves with periodicities on all time scales ( blackman et al.1996 ; fargion 1998 ) .",
    "collimated emission , however , received some attention because of its smaller energy requirements ( hartmann & woosley 1995 ; dar 1998 ) .",
    "mergers between compact objects have been popular to explain gamma - ray bursts . the observed burst rate ( @xmath3 events per year per galaxy , mao & paczyski 1992 ) is more than an order of magnitude smaller than estimates for the merger rate of binary neutron stars ( phinney 1991 ; naryan et al.1991 ) .",
    "this suggests that the majority of events are hidden .",
    "this can be understood by beaming the emission . for these sources",
    "only the afterglow would be observable ( rhoads 1997 ) .",
    "beaming of the gamma - ray emission is also favored because un - beamed models require an enormous amount of energy generated by distant gamma - ray bursts ( mezros et al.1998 ) .",
    "after glows of gamma - ray bursts appear to be close to star - forming regions ( paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "this un - favors the neutron star merging model ( bagot et al .",
    "1998 ; portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 ) .",
    "mergers between a black hole and a neutron star do not have this disadvantage as the space velocities of these binaries is smaller and their merger time is shorter .",
    "recently , portegies zwart ( 1998 ) proposed the gamma - ray binary as a model for gamma ray bursts .",
    "in such a binary a neutron star fills its roche - lobe and transfers mass to a black hole .",
    "mass transfer is stable for several seconds for black hole masses in a small range .",
    "if the mass of the black hole is smaller than @xmath4  the binary is dynamically unstable and for black holes more massive than @xmath5  the system is gravitationally unstable . for the binaries in which the mass of the black hole falls between these limits the neutron star material spirals in the black hole via an accretion disc .",
    "the magnetic field which is anchored in the disc , threads the black hole and taps its rotation energy via the blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) mechanism .",
    "this model can explain the complex temporal structure of gamma - ray bursts in a natural way .",
    "gamma - rays are emitted in a collimated cone or beam .",
    "the generated flux within the beam vanishes at the center of the locus , has largest value near the opening angle and dimmers to the edge .",
    "precession of the inner part of the disc causes the luminosity cone to sweep through space resulting in repeated pulses or flashes for the observer at a distant planet .",
    "the next section reviews the proposed model for the gamma - ray burst and discusses the expected range of parameters . in ",
    "3 the geometry of the model is explained and how a precessing disc leads to a complex light curve is described . a classification scheme is set out in  4 and we fit the proposed model to a number of observed gamma - ray bursts .",
    "our findings are discussed in  5 .",
    "the accretion rate onto a neutron star in a common envelope stage can be highly super eddington ( chevalier 1993 ; brown 1995 ) .",
    "the neutron star can not support this extra mass and collapses to a black hole .",
    "the result is a close binary system with a helium star ( the remainder of the giant ) and a black hole ( the collapsed neutron star ) . at the end of the common - envelope phase the mass of the black hole is between 2.4  and 7.0  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of black hole masses within this interval is uncertain and depends strongly on the density distribution in the envelope of the giant and the duration of the spiral in .",
    "a neutron star is formed after the collapse of the helium core .",
    "the sudden mass loss and the imparted velocity kick to the nascent neutron star may dissociate the binary .",
    "if the system remains bound , however , a neutron star  black hole binary is formed .    the separation between the two stars shrinks due to gravitational wave radiation ( see @xcite ) . when the separation is small enough ( orbital separation @xmath6 )",
    "the neutron star fills its roche lobe to the black hole within the age of the universe . mass transfer from the neutron star ( with mass @xmath7 ) to the black hole ( with mass @xmath8 )",
    "is driven by the emission of gravitational waves but coalescence is prevented by the redistribution of mass in the binary system .",
    "the entire episode of mass transfer lasts for several seconds up to minutes .",
    "mass transfer becomes unstable when the mass of the neutron star drops below the stability limit of @xmath9 since the neutron star starts to expand rapidly .",
    "initially the material of the neutron star falls in the black hole almost radially but at a later stage an accretion disc can be formed ( see portegies zwart 1998 ) .",
    "this accretion disc can support the strong magnetic field which threads the black hole and taps its rotation energy via the the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ) .",
    "the rotational energy of such a black hole is @xmath10 of its mass if maximal rotating , i.e. ; @xmath11ergs .",
    "the luminosity generated in the blandford - znajek process is @xmath12 } \\right)^2                        \\left ( { b \\over 10^{15 } [ g ] } \\right)^2         \\;\\ ; [ { \\rm erg\\,s}^{-1}].\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the angular momentum of the black hole relative to that in maximal rotation . a strong magnetic field ( @xmath14 ) is required to drive the engine .",
    "how it is generated is not well understood .",
    "however , strong magnetic fields in black holes have gained a lot of support over the last few years ( see e.g.  paczyski 1998b ) .",
    "also in proto neutron stars ( pal et al . 1998 ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ) strong magnetic fields of the order of @xmath15gauss are favored .",
    "the magnetic field is also anchored in the disc but the luminosity comes from the spin energy of the black hole ( katz 1997 ) .",
    "the misalignment in the spin axis of the black hole and the angular momentum axis of the binary causes the accretion disc around the black hole to precess .",
    "rigid body precession of such a keplerian disc is possible if the sound crossing time scale of the disc is small compared to the precession time scale ( papaloizou & terquem 1995 ; larwood et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is generally the case .",
    "the forced precession period @xmath16 is then ( larwood 1998 ) @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the angle between the orbital angular momentum axis and the spin axis of the accreting star .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath19 , the orbital period @xmath20 and the filling factor of the accretion disc around the black hole @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the semi - major axis of the orbit and @xmath23 is the size of the accretion disc , change in time as the neutron star loses mass to the black hole .    at any time an upper limit to the size of the accretion disc is given by the size of the roche - lobe of the black hole @xmath24 .",
    "for example : a 1.4  neutron star fills its roche lobe to a 3  black hole at an orbital separation of about 42.7 km .",
    "after 1.15  of the neutron star material is transferred conservatively to the black hole , an accretion disc starts to form ( see portegies zwart 1998 ) . at this moment",
    "the orbital separation has widened to approximately 135 km ( assuming that the neutron star is prescribed by a newtonian polytope ) , and @xmath25 . for small mass ratio",
    "the size of the accretion disc is approximately 0.87 times the roche - radius of the accretor ( paczyski 1977 ) , i.e. : @xmath26 .",
    "substitution of the parameters from the example into eq.[eq : ppre ] results in a lower limit to the precession period of the disc at the moment of its formation @xmath27    as mass transfer proceeds the precession period may change . in the model we neglect this effect but we return to it in the discussion  [ sect : discussion ] .      upon the formation of the neutron star",
    "the asymmetry in the supernova and the accompanying velocity ` kick ' may cause the orbital angular momentum axis to change direction , because the kick will generally be somewhat out of the orbital plane of the binary .    the angular momentum axis of the binary after the supernova makes an angle @xmath18 with that before the supernova .",
    "if we assume that mass lost in the supernova event does not affect the orbital angular momentum axis and the nascent neutron star receives a velocity kick of magnitude @xmath28 in the direction @xmath29 ( the angle with the orbital plane ) and @xmath30 ( the angle between the direction of motion of the helium star and the kick velocity in the orbital plane ) the new angular momentum axis follows from simple geometry : @xmath31^{1/2 } } \\label{eq : cos_nu}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the relative orbital velocity of the two stars prior to the supernova .",
    "we can calculate the probability distribution for the misalignment angle @xmath18 from the binary parameters before the supernova and by selecting a velocity distribution for the kick .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity kick is taken randomly from the distribution proposed by hartman ( 1997 ) as the intrinsic velocity distribution for single radio pulsars .",
    "this distribution is flat at velocities below 250  but has a tail extending to several thousand of @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36  the resulting probability distribution for the misalignment angle @xmath18 is presented in fig.[fig : pnu ] for various binary parameters .",
    "figure[fig : pnu ] shows that the majority of the binaries have @xmath37 , although larger angles are not excluded .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath38 ) of the binaries will even have retrograde angular momentum axes .    if the spin axis of the black hole is aligned with the angular momentum axis of the binary before the supernova , fig.[fig : pnu ] gives the probability distribution for the angle between the post supernova angular momentum axis and the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "substitution of the average angle between the angular momentum axis of the binary and the spin axis of the black hole into eq.[eq : pp ] gives a precession period of about a second .",
    "a lantern mounted along the rotation axis of a precessing object projects circles of light in a regular pattern .",
    "nutation of the object causes the light cone to make a number of small circles within each larger precession circle .    the accretion disc in the model precesses around the black hole . the magnetic field is anchored in the disc and precesses with the same period .",
    "the radiation cone therefore also precesses with the same period .",
    "the rotation period of the black hole is much smaller than the precession period of the disc .",
    "but even if the radiation cone would have the same period as the black hole this could not be observed with todays detectors due to their lack of time resolution .",
    "we return to this in the discussion  [ sect : discussion ]      slaved disc precession is a well known phenomenon in x - ray binaries ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1980 ; hut & van den heuvel 1981 ; band & grindlay 1984 ) and is also used to describe the complex light curves of extra galactic radio sources ( falcke & biermann 1998 ) .",
    "we use the same principle of the slaved disc around the accreting black hole to explain the complex light curves of bright gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the polar angle @xmath39 and the azimuth angle @xmath40 are defined in a spherical polar coordinate system .",
    "the spin axis of the black hole ( the locus of the gamma - ray jet ) can then be parameterized with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( band & grindlay 1984 ) @xmath43 here the precession and nutation frequencies are @xmath44 , @xmath45 with both periods @xmath16 and @xmath46 of the order of a second ( see eq.[eq : pp ] ) .",
    "the direction of the observer can also be parameterized using @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the angle @xmath49 between the observer @xmath50 and the central locus of the jet @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "a possible mechanism to generate a collimated gamma - ray jet from an accreting black hole is provided by the blandford - znajek process . in this process",
    "the rotation energy can be extracted from black hole by slowing down its rotation via the magnetic field which exert torque on the induced current on the black hole horizon ( thorne et al .",
    "the torque exerted by a surface element of the horizon is proportional to the product of magnetic flux @xmath53 through the surface element and the current @xmath54 .",
    "the power of this torque is carried by the poynting flux @xmath55 along the magnetic field lines , which rotate with angular velocity @xmath56 around the rotating black hole ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the poynting flux carried out through the magnetic surface between @xmath58 and @xmath59 is ( thorne et al .",
    "1986 ) @xmath60 here the magnetic surface is characterized by the embedded magnetic flux @xmath58 .",
    "the luminosity produced by the blandford - znajek process ( eq .",
    "1 ) is obtained by integrating eq.[dpi ] with average magnetic field @xmath61 on the horizon .",
    "collimation of the poynting flux is computed for two dimensional force - free solutions of the stream equation ( fendt 1997 ) . identifying the poynting flux as luminosity @xmath62 we parameterize the luminosity distribution in cylindrical coordinates @xmath63 here",

    "the opening angle @xmath69 is fixed by @xmath70 . a small opening angle @xmath71 with @xmath72 are assumed . the magnetic flux @xmath58 , current distribution @xmath54 and the angular velocity of the magnetic field @xmath56 are then ( fendt 1997 )    @xmath73    where @xmath74 the following parameters are used : @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "fig.[fig : lphi ] presents the @xmath49 dependence of the luminosity for a range of parameters .",
    "note that the luminosity vanishes at @xmath78 and has a peak near the opening angle , which are characteristics of this distribution .",
    "the intrinsic time variation of a single gamma - ray burst has a short rise time followed by a linear decay ( fenimore 1997 ) .",
    "we construct a burst time profile from three components : an exponential rise with characteristic time scale @xmath79 , a plateau phase with time scale @xmath80 and a stiff decay with time scale @xmath81 .",
    "we selected the following function : @xmath82    \\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath83 is normalized with constant @xmath84 to fit @xmath85 at its maximum .",
    "[ fig : iintrinsic ] gives an example of the function for the selected parameters .",
    "the choice of this function is rather arbitrary .",
    "lack of understanding of the inner engine which drives the burst provides the freedom to choose this profile .",
    "the main reason to select this function is that it is smooth and easy to adjust with three time scales ; a rise time , a plateau time and a decay time .",
    "we illustrate the light curves produced by the model in  [ sect : examples ]",
    ". fits to real observed gamma - ray bursts are presented in  [ sect : fits ] .      to study the general behavior of the temporal structure of the model we define the frequency ratio , @xmath86 which can be negative .",
    "to illustrate the temporal behavior of the intrinsic intensity we select @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    in the following series of figures we show how the behavior of the temporal structure of the luminosity curve changes by varying the observation angle @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the initial direction of the spin axis of the locus @xmath90 , the nutation frequency relative to the precession frequency @xmath91 and the precession period @xmath16 . for simplicity",
    "the selected parameters are presented in the following format ( @xmath16 , @xmath91 , @xmath90 ; @xmath47 @xmath48 ) . since we do not yet attempt to fit any data we chose @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 for most examples .",
    "figure[fig:0_1_02_0_10_0 ] gives the observed light curve for a fixed angle @xmath95 .",
    "the luminosity cone is steady rotating , the observer makes an angle of @xmath96 with the central locus of the luminosity cone , in this case the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "the result is an observed flux smaller than at its maximum but the luminosity curve has the same temporal shape as fig.[fig : iintrinsic ] : an angle of @xmath97 would result in fig.[fig : iintrinsic ] .",
    "the observers line of sight moves clockwise along the solid curve in the upper right corner of fig.[fig:0_1_02_0_10_0 ] . increasing @xmath98 results in a counter clockwise shift of the starting point indicated with the @xmath99 in fig.[fig:0_1_02_0_10_0 ] .",
    "figure[fig:0_1_02_2_0_0 ] demonstrates the effect of varying only three of the parameters while @xmath100 .",
    "increasing @xmath101 causes the precession and nutation of the luminosity cone to make larger circles in space .",
    "sometimes our line of sight completely misses the cone which results in the absence of flux .",
    "increasing @xmath90 to about @xmath102 results in a picket fence pattern as the luminosity is pulsed with high frequency ( not shown ) .",
    "figure[fig:0_1_02_2_12_0 ] shows the effect of changing @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "the pattern becomes irregular and by changing the parameters the pattern quickly changes .      .",
    "the model contains a total of nine parameters ( tab.[tab : param ] ) which are more or less free to choose within the theoretical framework . for practical reasons we introduced the dead time @xmath103 which is the initial time between the batse trigger and the start - up of the real burst . in most cases this time scale is of the order of a second or so .",
    "the intrinsic parameters for the @xmath58-dependence of the intrinsic luminosity within the cone ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) are treated as fixed parameters .",
    "fitting a nine - parameter model is not a trivial exercise , especially if the result depends sensitively on their proper values .",
    "even if fitting is possible at all it is still not certain what the fitted model tells us about the underlying physical process .",
    "in some cases equally satisfactory fits are obtained with different parameters .",
    "the first step in the fitting procedure is to determine the background .",
    "this is done on the initial , @xmath107 , time bins of 64ms in the data stream of each observed burst .",
    "the average count rate in this part is used as background . note",
    "that modeling the return to the background at the end of the burst is as important as modeling the peaks of the bursts .",
    "we use simulated annealing ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) to fit the observed bursts .",
    "the parameters described in tab.[tab : param ] are chosen freely but initially preferred values are suggested . after each iteration",
    "we determine the @xmath108 from the fit of the binned ( in 64ms bins ) model data to the observed burst profile .",
    "this value is minimized by the annealing algorithm . the temperature in the process",
    "was reduced according to @xmath109 . here",
    "@xmath110 is the highest value of @xmath108 found in the initial set of nine randomly selected bursts , @xmath111 is the cumulative number of iterations and @xmath112 is the scheduled number of iterations ( in most cases between @xmath113 and @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature was lowered after each 900 iterations .",
    "we applied this method to the same sample of gamma - ray bursts which was used by norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to fit flattened gaussians to individual pulses in complex bursts profiles .",
    "we fitted the energy channel between 115kev and 320kev , which has the highest counts for most bursts and is therefore least plagued by noise ( the fitting procedure has the tendency to fit the noise as well ) .",

    "table [ tab : fits ] and the figs.[fig : grb143 ] to [ fig : grb2228 ] give the results of fits to a number of gamma - ray bursts . the peak intensity in the modeled bursts",
    "( see @xmath114 in tab.[tab : fits ] ) is generally close to the intrinsic maximum of the burst but the observable fluency ( @xmath115 ) is generally much smaller than the intrinsic integrated luminosity of the burst .",
    "figures[fig : grb143 ] and [ fig : grb543 ] give the fits to batse trigger number 143 and 543 , respectively . only the overall shape of the bursts are fitted reasonably well .",
    "smaller details appeared to be hard to fit with the selected parameters .",
    "figures[fig : grb999 ] , [ fig : grb1425 ] and [ fig : grb1609 ] gives the result of the fits to batse trigger numbers 999 , 1425 and 1609 , respectively .",
    "the result of these fits are rather satisfactory .",
    "even the individual peaks within each burst tend to be asymmetric which is also the case in real gamma - ray bursts .",
    "figures[fig : grb1683 ] and [ fig : grb1683a ] , batse trigger number 1683 , shows two fits to a very complicated burst ( see also tab.[tab : fits ] ) .",
    "the fitting procedure produces several solutions which a broad range of shapes ranging from a single smooth curve to sharp symmetric peaks .",
    "possibly not all peaks in batse trigger number 1974 , fig.[fig : grb1974 ] , are real .",
    "we decided to present the smooth solution which reproduces the over all shape of the burst .",
    "batse trigger 2067 , fig.[fig : grb2067 ] , shows a lot of small details of which some may be noise . in this case",
    "we decided to show the fit with a lot of small structure to demonstrate how the model attempts to reproduce the noise if the adopted fitting procedure is continued for too long .",
    "the observed burst with batse trigger 2228 , fig.[fig : grb2228 ] , is extremely spiky .",
    "we show the smooth fit to the burst which presents the overall shape but neglects the smaller details . in this burst we had difficulty reproducing the smaller structures as the fitting procedure attempts to fit the peaks more accurately than the valleys .",
    "the relatively simple geometry of a precessing accretion disc around a black hole provides an excellent model for long lasting gamma - ray bursts with a complex temporal structure .",
    "the large number of free parameters and the low quality of the observational data , however , make it hard to fit the observations and to draw conclusions on the resulting parameters .",
    "there are often several solutions which lead to equally satisfactory fits but at a different total luminosity ( compare figs.[fig : grb1683 ] and [ fig : grb1683a ] ) .",
    "this makes classification difficult",
    ".    observed gamma - ray bursts are asymmetric at all time scale ( norris et al .",
    "some fitted examples , however , show symmetric peaks , which limits the reliability of the model and the fits ( nemiroff et al .",
    "1994 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we assumed that the precession and nutation period , and their amplitudes are all constant as in a force free environment .",
    "also the black hole is assumed to rotate around its center of mass , which is not affected by variations in the binary parameters , or the accretion disc . including these parameters",
    "complicates the model considerably and may cause individual peeks to become asymmetric .",
    "the advantage of our model is that it follows rather natural from a system in which a black hole is orbited by a precessing accretion disc .",
    "precessing accretion discs are common phenomena and the temporal structure of x - ray binaries are often explained with a similar model ( see larwood 1998 and references herein ) .",
    "apart from the similarity with existing objects like x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei the precessing beam solves two problems : 1 ) the irregular behavior of the precessing beam can cause the burst to show up and disappear at unpredictable moments .",
    "2 ) the radiation is not isotropic and therefore the amount of energy radiated is considerably smaller than the estimate based on the assumption of spherical symmetry ( see third column in tab.[tab : fits ] ) .",
    "the energy budget of observed gamma - ray bursts reflects then a considerable fraction of the total amount of energy radiated ( mszros et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the characteristic energy dependence of observed gamma - ray bursts ( the peaks get narrower for higher energies ) could be explained by a decrease in the opening angle with energy .",
    "however , lack of the background physics prevents us from modeling this process in greater detail .",
    "another interesting implications is that all gamma - ray bursts may intrinsically produce the same amount of energy but since only a small fraction of the produced energy is detectable they can not be used as standard candles .",
    "if the inner engine would be able to work for a longer period , days or weeks , repeated bursts from the same source may be observed within these time intervals .",
    "mass transfer from a neutron star to a black hole is not likely to last for more than a few minutes but if a similar binary with a white dwarf as donor could produce similar characteristics the time scale on which the inner engine is working becomes of the order of hours or days .",
    "we assumed that the spin axis of the black hole and the locus of the gamma - ray jet are aligned .",
    "the introduction of an extra angle would strongly alter the @xmath49-dependence of the luminosity generated in the jet . in that case",
    "the gamma - ray jet passes our line of sight with the spin frequency of the black hole .",
    "this time scale is much shorter than the time resolution of the current gamma - ray detectors .",
    "a significant improvement in the time resolution of gamma - ray detectors may find such objects to be visible as gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "the pulse period in such pulsars will be of the order of the rotation period of the black hole .    within the discussed model for a gamma - ray burst from a gamma - ray binary",
    "three configurations can be imagined which all lead to a different observational phenomenon : 1 ) gamma - ray bursts with one or more peaks in the line of the model discussed in this paper .",
    "2 ) systems where mass transfer from the neutron star to the black hole is unstable and directly results in a merger ( see portegies zwart 1998 ) .",
    "3 ) a short burst if the black hole spins retrograde relative to the binary angular momentum axis . this happens in less than 1% of the bursts .",
    "observations also distinguish between three different classes of gamma - ray bursts : short and faint bursts , long and bright and a third class of intermediate bursts(mukherjee et al .",
