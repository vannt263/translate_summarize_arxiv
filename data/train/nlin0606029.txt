    "recent years , a growing number of cryptosystems based on chaos synchronization have been proposed  @xcite , many of them fundamentally flawed by a lack of robustness and security .",
    "the first schemes of synchronization - related chaotic cryptography were based on the masking of a plaintext message by a system variable of a chaotic generator @xcite .",
    "the receiver had to synchronize with the sender to regenerate the chaotic signal and thus recover the message . this simple design is easily broken by elemental filtering of the ciphertext signal @xcite .",
    "recently , there appeared some chaotic cryptosystems with an enhanced plaintext concealment mechanism : the ciphertext consisted of a complicated non - linear combination of the plaintext and a variable of a chaotic transmitter generator , from which it was an unattainable goal to retrieve a clean plaintext . as it was impossible to synchronize a chaotic receiver with such ciphertext",
    ", a second channel was used for synchronization . the synchronizing signal was a different sender chaotic variable , that was transmitted without modification .",
    "the same system parameters values were used at sender and receiver @xcite .",
    "one of these cryptosystems , proposed by jiang  @xcite , made use of the lorenz chaotic system  @xcite , that is defined by the following equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fixed parameters .",
    "the ciphertext @xmath4 was defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the plaintext .",
    "the receiver was designed as a reduced order nonlinear observer with a mechanism to achieve efficient partial synchronization , under the drive of @xmath7 .",
    "it can generate two signals @xmath8 and @xmath9 that converge to the driver system variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , as @xmath12 .",
    "the recovered plaintext @xmath13 was retrieved with the function : @xmath14    it was given an example in  @xcite with the following functions : @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; the following parameter values : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; and with the following initial conditions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the plaintext was a small amplitude sinusoidal signal of 30 hz , @xmath22 .",
    "the author claimed that this cryptosystem guarantees higher security and privacy , showing that an error of 0.05 in the retrieval of @xmath23 , due to a poor parameter estimation , giving rise to a serious distortion in the retrieved plaintext .    in the vast majority of chaotic cryptosystems ,",
    "the security relies on the secrecy of the system parameters , which play the role of secret key .",
    "hence , the determination of the system parameters is equivalent to breaking the system .",
    "recently , solak  @xcite analyzed the cryptosystem  @xcite and showed how an eavesdropper could identify the value of the parameter @xmath2 , provided that it has the previous knowledge of the two other transmitter system parameters @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "solak s approach was based on a novel expression of the lorenz system .",
    "formerly stojanovski , kocarev and parlitz  @xcite described a generic method , to reveal simultaneously all the three parameters of a lorenz system when one of the the variables @xmath7 or @xmath10 were known , that could be applied to break this cryptosystem .",
    "the present work describes an efficient determination method of the only two unknown parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 needed to build up an intruder lorenz system receiver , from the ciphertext alone , without partial knowledge of any transmitter parameters .",
    "firstly , some geometrical properties of the lorenz attractor are shown .",
    "then , advantage is taken of them to minimize , as much as possible , the parameters search space .",
    "finally , the unknown receiver parameters are determined with high accuracy .",
    "according to @xcite , the lorenz system has three equilibrium points .",
    "the origin is an equilibrium point for all parameter values ; for @xmath24 the origin is a globally attracting asymptotically stable sink ; for @xmath25 the origin becomes a non - stable saddle point , giving rise to two other stable twin equilibrium points @xmath26 and @xmath27 , of coordinates @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , being @xmath31 a critical value , corresponding to a hopf bifurcation @xcite , whose value is : @xmath32    when @xmath2 exceeds the critical value @xmath31 the equilibrium points @xmath26 and @xmath27 become non - stable saddle foci , by a hopf bifurcation , and the strange lorenz attractor appears .",
    "the flow , linearized around @xmath26 and @xmath27 , has one negative real eigenvalue and a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues with positive real part . as a consequence",
    ", the equilibrium points are linearly attracting and spirally repelling .",

    "it is a well known fact that the lorenz attractor trajectory draws two 3d loops , in the vicinity of the equilibrium points @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with a spiral like shape of steadily growing amplitude , jumping from one of them to the other , at irregular intervals , in a random like manner though actually deterministic @xcite . the trajectory may pass arbitrarily near to the equilibrium points , but never reach them while in chaotic regime .",
    "cerror ( 95,0.9)@xmath39    the geometrical properties of lorenz system allows for a previous reduction of the search space of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters , taking advantage of the relation of them with the coordinates @xmath40 of the equilibrium points .",
    "let us call attractor _",
    "eyes _ to the two neighborhood regions around the equilibrium points that are not filled with the spiral trajectory .",
    "the eye centres are the fixed points @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the pending problem is to determine the eye centres when the inner turns are missing , as happens in normal chaotic regime . with the drive signal @xmath7",
    ", we solved it by experimentally estimating the middle point value of the trajectory maxima and minima in the phase space projection on the @xmath36 plane .",
    "the best result was obtained by taking into account only the regular spiral cycle closest to the center , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atractor](b ) as a thick continuous line .",
    "the @xmath41-coordinate of the eye center was calculated with the following empirical formula : @xmath42 where @xmath35 is the minimum of all the maxima of @xmath43 spiral trajectory , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the two minima immediately preceding and following @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "as the spiral has a growing radius , it was necessary to take a weighted mean between the two minima @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the optimal values of the two weights were determined experimentally . instead of making two computations , one around @xmath26 and another around @xmath27 , a unique computation was done on the absolute value waveform @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that all the first maxima after a change of sign of @xmath7 and @xmath10 must be discarded because they belong to the incoming trajectory portion attracted by the equilibrium points @xmath44 and do not belong to the spiral trajectory , one of them is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atractor](b ) as a thick dashed line .",
    "the result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cerror ] .",
    "it can be seen that the relative value of the error , taking the eye center coordinate @xmath45 instead of the true value of @xmath39 , is less than @xmath46 .",
    "the system parameters were varied in the margins : @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the system initial conditions were the same as the example of @xcite ; the period of measurement was 20 s and the sampling frequency was 1200 hz .    in this way , the search space of the unknown parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 is reduced to a narrow margin defined as @xmath50 .    applying this method to the proposed example of  @xcite ,",
    "whose equilibrium point is @xmath51 , the absolute determination error of @xmath45 was @xmath52 , equivalent to a relative error of @xmath53 .",
    "we designed an intruder receiver based on a homogeneous driving synchronization mechanism @xcite between the transmitter drive lorenz system and a receiver response subsystem , that was a partial duplicate of the drive system reduced to only two variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , driven by the drive variable @xmath7 .",
    "the response system was defined by the following equations : @xmath54    note that for breaking the system it is only necessary to get the knowledge of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. the parameter @xmath1 may be ignored and need not be determined , unlike in the solak method  @xcite which requires its previous knowledge , or in the stojanovski et all .",
    "method  @xcite which requires the simultaneous determination of all the three unknown parameters .    as it was shown in  (",
    "* @xmath55iii ) , this drive - response configuration has two conditional lyapunov exponents , both fairly negative , thus leading to a very estable system .",
    "the consequence is that , if the parameters of drive and response systems are moderately different , the drive and response variables will be alike , though not totally identical .",
    "this property may be exploited to search the right parameter values looking at the retrieved plaintext and applying an optimization procedure to find the parameters that provide the best retrieved plaintext quality .",

    "( [ eq : receiver ] ) and the parameters of both systems agree , i.e. @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the variables @xmath58 and @xmath23 of the drive an response systems are equal , hence the recovered text @xmath13 follows the plaintext @xmath59 exactly ; being negligible the effect of different initial conditions after a very short transient .",
    "if the parameters of both systems do not agree , the recovered text will consist of a noisy distorted version of the original plaintext , growing the noise and distortion as the mismatch between drive and response systems parameters grows .      in the particular case of the example in  (",
    "* @xmath55iii ) , the encryption and decryption functions were : @xmath60 equation  ( [ eq : retrieved ] ) of the recovered text can be rewritten as : @xmath61 this equation has two terms , the first one is a function of the plaintext message @xmath59 and the variables @xmath58 and @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath62 the term is reduced to the undistorted plaintext , but if @xmath63 a distortion appears .",
    "the second term is a function of @xmath58 and @xmath23 and can be considered as a jamming noise .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] depicts the spectrum of the recovered text corresponding to the example , but with a wrong guessing of the response system parameters : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it can be seen that the spectrum has two main frequency bands : one around the plaintext @xmath59 frequency of @xmath66 , that corresponds to the distorted plaintext , and another near @xmath67 that corresponds to the jamming noise .",
    "assuming that the plaintext will always consist of an a.c . band limited signal without d.c .",

    "figure[fig : noisepower ] illustrates the mean value of the squared noise @xmath78 , i.e. the average noise power , as a function of @xmath68 , with the eye center @xmath45 as parameter , with the same transmitter system parameters of the numerical example presented in @xcite and the intruder receiver described by eq .",
