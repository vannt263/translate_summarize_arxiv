    "the solidification of a drying colloidal dispersion has similarities with sedimentation @xcite , filtration @xcite , and the freezing @xcite of multiphase fluids , as well as the solidification of polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "a mass and momentum balance for all phases is necessary to describe the compression of the dispersed particles by a flow towards the solidification , or drying front .",
    "the essential ideas behind models of this kind can be traced back to kynch s theory of sedimentation @xcite , or to biot s theory of poroelasticity @xcite .",
    "the former treats the evolution of a two - phase mixture with liquid - like properties , while the latter deals with flows and deformations in a mixture with solid - like properties . in recent years",
    ", more general models have evolved that can smoothly transition between these two limiting behaviours @xcite .",
    "the above class of models focus on essentially mean - field , or continuum approximations of the behaviour of an enormous number of small interacting colloidal particles .",
    "for example , in a 50 @xmath0l drop of a typical dispersion with 100 nm particles at a 10% volume fraction , there are about one trillion particles , more than twice the number of stars in the milky way .",
    "this is a comfortably large number for such approximations , yet a number of observations have shown additional effects that go well beyond the capacity of these models : the formation of crystals with rate - dependent structures @xcite , or which show fractionation and multiple - phase coexistence @xcite ; crystalline domains with grain boundaries that can influence flow patterns @xcite ; birefringence and structural anisotropy @xcite ; plasticity during fracture @xcite ; and shear - banding @xcite .",
    "some of these responses are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_intro ] .",
    "they largely involve the onset of solid - like properties , such as a yield stress or shear modulus , as a colloidal material concentrates during drying .        here",
    "we will explore how well a continuum model of drying colloidal dispersions agrees with the behaviour of colloidal silica dispersions .",
    "these dispersions allow for a great range of colloidal interactions to be explored by varying the size of their constituent particles , and the chemistry of the dispersing fluid .",
    "we begin by outlining a force and mass balance model , which describes the general behaviour of a drying front .",
    "this model is completed by a poisson - boltzmann cell model of inter - particle interactions , which estimates the osmotic pressure of a dispersion under different conditions .",
    "these paired models are then tested by x - ray scattering experiments that reveal the structure of drying dispersions .",
    "finally , to relate this to the general theme of this special issue , _ patterning through instabilities in complex media _ , we show how some of the more complex aspects of colloidal interactions can be used to control the shear - banding and fracture instabilities .",
    "we will outline here a mean - field theory of how a colloidal dispersion , such as paint , should behave when it dries under simple conditions that allow for a one - dimensional flow .",
    "this is how a dispersion would behave in a hele - shaw cell ( e.g. @xcite ) or capillary tube @xcite that is drying from one end .",
    "similar models have been developed for the slightly different case of evaporation in a microfluidic microreactor , such as the designs of salmon and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the model is also compatible with the drying of polymers , such as in refs .",
    "@xcite , if the cell model of section [ s_cell ] is replaced by an appropriate polymer equation of state .",
    "we consider a colloidal dispersion that is drying in a hele - shaw cell , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ model1 ] .",
    "the cell has a regular ( usually rectangular ) cross - section , and two ends .",
    "evaporation occurs at a rate ( volume flux per unit area ) @xmath1 at one end , while the other end is fed by a reservoir of colloidal dispersion , with some initial volume fraction @xmath2 .",
    "the dispersion flows slowly through the cell , from one end to the other , along a direction @xmath3 .",
    "while the liquid phase can evaporate from the drying end , the solid colloidal particles must remain behind and will accumulate there . over time they will build up a porous solid deposit with final volume fraction @xmath4 , that will grow back into the cell at some velocity @xmath5 .    within the cell one can distinguish between the velocity of the colloidal particles , @xmath6 , the velocity of the dispersant liquid , @xmath7 , and a bulk velocity @xmath8 . here",
    ", all velocities are averaged over the cross - section of the cell .",
    "this thus neglects any effects of gravity , such as sedimentation - driven instabilities near the solidification front @xcite .",
    "if there are no material losses in the cell , then the total flux everywhere must balance the drying rate at the edge , @xmath9 .",
    "far from the solidification front both the particles and the liquid will travel together at this speed . the mean velocity , @xmath6 , and volume fraction , @xmath10 , of the particles can evolve , however . in particular , they will slow and concentrate as they approach the solidification front . during this process a mass balance on the solid phase requires that @xmath11 we want to know how the evolution of @xmath6 and @xmath10 near the solidification front depends on the properties of the dispersion . to do so",
    ", we now use a momentum balance to find an expression for the solid volume flux @xmath12 .     and",
    "evaporation occurs at the far right at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "a solid deposit grows in from the drying edge at a velocity @xmath5 .",
    "near the liquid - solid transition the particles slow down , from an initial velocity @xmath13 to zero , and concentrate until they reach a final volume fraction @xmath14 .",
    "this results in a thin transition region , governed by a balance between advection and diffusion , where the properties of the dispersion change rapidly .",

    "the flow of water past the particles will cause drag , and transfer momentum from the fluid phase to the dispersed phase .",
    "the pressure of a small parcel of dispersion , containing both solid and liquid , can be divided between @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total , or thermodynamic , pressure ; @xmath17 is the pressure of the fluid phase , as would be measured by a manometer through a dialysis membrane that blocks the particles @xcite ; and @xmath18 is the osmotic pressure of the dispersed charged particles . starting from the viewpoint of a compliant solid , the equivalent poroelastic balance between a total ( or effective ) stress @xmath19 , a stress borne by the network of particles , @xmath20 , and the fluid ( or pore ) pressure , @xmath17 , can be expressed in tensor notation as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kroneker delta function , and the sign difference is due to the different conventions of positive stress versus pressure .",

    "colloidal interactions can be included by introducing an equation of state @xmath37 , where the compressibility factor @xmath38 depends on the interaction potential between particles ( for example , for an ideal gas @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 is the boltzmann energy ( we use @xmath41 k throughout this paper ) . by combing these definitions , eq .",

    "we showed that a force and mass balance allowed us to predict how a colloidal dispersion is compressed along one axis as it dries , and how this compression affects the state of the dispersion . here",
    "we will attempt make connections between these results and the macroscopic mechanical instabilities that accompany drying , namely the appearance of shear bands and cracks in a drying colloidal film .",
    "in particular , we will show that the magnitude of shear relieved by the shear bands is controlled by the total amount of strain accumulated across the liquid - solid transition , and that the anisotropy caused by the transition can also control the paths of any subsequent cracks that form .",

    "although such features have often been noticed ( e.g. @xcite ) , they have only recently been shown to be shear bands @xcite , and they form at @xmath139 to the direction of drying . here",

    "light with a polarisation that is either parallel or perpendicular to this axis will pass through the film unchanged  all other polarisations will be modified by the film .",
    "the shear bands focus distortion into their immediate neighbourhood , and thus can locally reorient the optic axis , rotating it one way or the other .",
    "if the sample is between crossed polarisers , this rotation is visible as a change in the colour and/or intensity of transmitted light .    of the types of colloidal silica used in this study ,",
    "levasil 30 ( akzonobel ; particle radius @xmath140 nm ) has a particularly strong birefringence .",

    "were diluted by mixing with equal volumes of nacl solutions of various concentrations .",
    "this resulted in dispersions with an initial particle volume fraction of @xmath141 , and electrolyte concentrations of 33213 m@xmath80 .",
    "these samples were dried in 150 @xmath0 m thick hele - shaw cells , built from @xmath142 mm@xmath77 glass microscope slides and plastic spacers , held together by clips .",
    "to each cell 175 @xmath0l of dispersion was added , which took about a day to dry into a solid deposit about 15 mm thick , at ambient temperature ( @xmath143c ) and relative humidity .",
    "the dried films were imaged in a polarising microscope , between crossed polarising filters , and a half - wavelength filter ( first - order retardation plate ) , as sketched in fig . [ shearbands](a ) . in this setup , using white light , birefringence in the film appears as variations in colour  see fig .",
    "[ shearbands](b , c ) .",
    "we noticed that as the salt concentration of the dispersion was increased , the intensity of the colour variations decreased ; the films appeared more uniform in hue .",
    "further , for high salt concentrations ( @xmath144 m@xmath80 ) , in addition to the main shear bands , many additional fainter shear bands could also be seen , as in fig .",
    "[ shearbands](c ) .",
    "finally , at salt concentrations of 143 m@xmath80 and above , no bands were seen ( other than , occasionally , a few bands near boundaries ) .    to map the distortion caused by the shear bands we rotated the sample stage , collecting images of each film at @xmath145 intervals .",
    "the setup was as described above , but in this case the light was passed through a 533 nm filter , before the first polariser .",
    "the resulting images were then digitally counter - rotated so that , by comparing an image series , we could measure the intensity @xmath146 of the transmitted light through any particular point in the film , as it was turned about an angle @xmath147 .",
    "for the green light used , @xmath148 will be minimised when the optic axis is oriented along one of the crossed polarisers . by fitting a sinusoidal variation in the light , @xmath149 , at each pixel , we could measure the orientation @xmath71 of the optic axis across the film , as shown in fig .",
    "[ shearbands2](a ) .",
    "the average shear that is taken up by the shear bands can thus be related to the root - mean - squared average of the reorientation of the optic axis , or @xmath150 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ shearbands2](b ) , the average twist in the film slowly decreases from about @xmath151 for the drying of dispersion at an as - supplied salt concentration , to @xmath152 at about 100 m@xmath80 salt , just before the bands disappear .",
    "if the shear bands form at the liquid - solid transition , then we can predict the amount of shear available for the bands to release and compare it to what is observed . as described in section ii.(a ) , drag forces across this transition provide a compressive force on the colloidal dispersion , which responds by increasing in volume fraction .",
    "once the particles have formed a soft repulsive solid , they can carry a shear stress , or an anisotropic strain . to calculate the amount of shear strain available to the shear bands , we assume that the dispersion is compressed uniaxially from the critical volume fraction @xmath153 , where it first forms a soft solid ( i.e. the first points in fig .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the particles will gel into a soft repulsive solid when @xmath163 reaches a few times @xmath40 , while in @xcite the structural anisotropy associated with similar drying colloids was shown to begin at the same point .",
    "finally , in @xcite the presence of shear bands in a dried film was shown to require a pair potential of @xmath164 , using the same potential as eq .",
    "[ dlvo ] . using that approximation",
    "we then defined @xmath153 as the concentration where the pair potential between two neighbouring particles reached 5 @xmath40 , and assumed that @xmath165 , or that the final aggregated state is one of random close - packed particles .    in fig .",
    "[ shearbands2](b ) we compare the accumulated shear strain @xmath115 following from this series of approximations ( and expressed as an engineering strain , in degrees ) , with the average reorientation , @xmath10 , observed in dried levasil films , for different salt concentrations .",
    "we fit @xmath115 to the data by allowing for a single scaling factor in the magnitude of @xmath115 , of order one , and find that there is good agreement between the strain that is generated across the liquid - solid transition , and the strain released by the formation of shear bands .",
    "the disappearance of the bands at higher salt concentrations , as for the dispersions studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , is also well - captured by this model . in other words",
    ", we found that the total distortion caused by the shear bands is simply proportional to the total compression of the liquid - solid transition in the drying dispersion .",
    "as they dry , many colloidal dispersions also crack , due to capillary forces @xcite .",
    "this is a concern for coatings such as paints , and also presents a limit to the manufacture of photonic materials @xcite .",
    "however , the control and guidance of cracks in thin films , for example in microfabrication applications , has recently become a topic of some interest @xcite .",
    "one can imagine such features allowing for the directional control of the friction , conductivity , or permeability of a surface coating , for example .",
    "for a drying colloidal film the direction of crack growth is usually noticed to be perpendicular to the drying fronts ( e.g.@xcite ) , at least in simple geometries such as the flat liquid - solid transitions sketched in fig .",
    "[ saxs_methods ] .",
    "this involves growing from a region of high stress ( near the edge of the cell , where evaporation is occurring ) , to one of low stress ( by the liquid - solid transition ) .",
    "fracture mechanics , however , requires that a growing crack tries to maximise the difference between its local strain energy release rate , and the cost of creating new crack surfaces ( the _ critical _ strain energy release rate ) @xcite .",
    "it is thus somewhat surprising that cracks are not more often deflected back towards the edge of the drying layer , where the strain energies are highest . here",
    "we argue that , instead , cracks in dried colloidal materials are guided by the structural anisotropy of the dried film , and hence the memory of the way in which they dried .",
    "if the packing of particles , and particle - particle contacts , is direction - dependant , then the energy consumed in extending a crack should also be direction - dependant .",
    "all else being equal , the crack will then preferentially grow along the easiest direction ( i.e. where the critical strain energy release rate is smallest ) , just as in crystalline materials a crack will often tend to grow along certain preferred crystal planes .    , and standard deviation @xmath166 ) . panel ( c )",
    "shows another experiment , where one side of the cell was sealed after 5 hours . in this case",
    "the front positions are shown in 4-hour steps , and one can see how the cracks bend to follow the memory of the drying .",
    "videos of the drying process for both experiments are provided as supplemental online information .",
    ", width=135 ]    to demonstrate this we again dried levasil 30 in hele - shaw cells .",
    "the appearance of cracks in this dispersion is relatively delayed , and in some cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cracks ] , will not take place until the entire dispersion has fully solidified in the drying cell . by modifying the pattern of evaporation during drying we could thus guide the drying fronts in relatively arbitrary ways . here , as in the shear - band experiments above , we prepared cells from two glass microscope slides ( either 75 @xmath103 25 mm@xmath77 or 75 @xmath103 50 mm@xmath77 ) .",
    "however , various arrangements of spacers and gaps were made around the edges of the cells , to allow for evaporation along different parts of the cell perimeter .",
    "for example , in the experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ cracks](a ) there are four small gaps of 5 - 10 mm along the sides of the cell , and both the top and bottom of the cell have also been left open .",
    "changes to drying could also be made during an experiment , by sealing any edge with vacuum grease ( dow corning silicon grease ) . at the start of any experiment",
    "aqueous dispersions of levasil 30 ( as - received ) were pipetted into the cells , which were initially inclined slightly to allow the dispersion to settle to one side .",
    "after a solid layer of material had appeared around the edges of the cell , they were then hung vertically , and time lapse photographs ( typically taken every 150 s ) were taken of the drying process .",
    "the cells were refilled intermittently during drying , by pipetting additional dispersion into the top edge .    in each case",
    "we found that when cracks form , they are preferentially aligned with the direction along which the dispersion had solidified .",
    "this was true for points throughout the film , even if cracks appeared hours after that region had aggregated [ fig .",
    "[ cracks](a , b ) ] or if the drying front had moved well on , and had subsequently changed shape [ fig .",
    "[ cracks](c ) ] . for one experiment ,",
    "[ cracks](a ) shows the drying cell at one - hour intervals , with the position of the liquid - solid front traced out in black .",
    "the final pattern of cracks , which occur after the entire film has solidified , clearly reflects the pattern of drying , and in particular the cracks are parallel to the direction of compression of the material everywhere in the dry deposit . to confirm this effect quantitatively we measured 463 intersections between cracks and the set of drying front profiles displayed in fig .",
    "[ cracks](a ) , and determined the misalignment between the outward - pointing normal to the liquid - solid transition at those points , and the direction that a crack subsequently followed .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ cracks](b ) , these two directions are , on average , very well aligned",
    ". their difference is fit by a simple gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath167 and a standard deviation of @xmath166 .",
    "in other words , the anisotropy in the film , formed in response to the drag forces of water flowing across the liquid - solid transition region during drying , is generally found to share the same orientation as the subsequent cracking .",
    "we suggest that the change in microstructure of the material changes its fracture energy along different orientations , thus explaining the observed correlation .",
    "the observations we describe here are similar to the memory effect studied by nakahara and coauthors ( e.g. @xcite ) , and which was shown in fig . [",
    "fig_intro](c ) .",
    "they showed how a wide variety of cues , such as vibration , flow , or standing faraday waves , can be used to template crack patterns in pastes and slurries .",
    "the common condition for all of their work is that the memory of some event can influence later cracking in materials with a yield - stress , by pre - conditioning the material with an anisotropic pre - stress or strain .",
    "this memory effect appears to also hold true for dried colloidal materials , and to reflect the yield - strain phase that the material temporarily passes through as it changes from a liquid dispersion , to a solid aggregated deposit .",
    "as they dry colloidal materials can go through a series of mechanical instabilities including shear band formation , wrinkling , buckling , cracking , delamination , etc .",
    "these responses are controlled by forces that arise from microscopic interactions , between nearby particles and between particles and the fluid that surrounds them . in order to be able to control these instabilities",
    ", one must first understand these interactions , and how they scale up to cause a macroscopic effect .",
    "we presented an advection - diffusion model of a drying colloidal dispersion in a regular channel .",
    "this one - dimensional representation sought to test when a simple mean - field approach to particle interactions was valid , and when additional details would need to be considered .",
    "the model was fed by a poisson - boltzmann cell ( pbc ) model of the electrostatic interactions between particles .",
    "this was developed in such a way that it could predict the osmotic pressure and concentration ( or collective ) diffusivity of a charged colloidal dispersion , and how that dispersion would behave as it was dried .",
    "it had no free parameters , once the size and charge of the colloidal particles was chosen , along with the salt concentration of the dispersant liquid .",
    "the predictions of this pair of models were tested against observations of charged colloidal silica nanoparticles , consisting of three different grades of ludox dialysed against a variety of salt solutions .",
    "we found that the pbc model accurately predicts the osmotic pressure of these dispersions as they are slowly concentrated to intermediate volume fractions , but that some discrepancies arose at higher salt concentrations ( 10 - 50 mm ) , where the model systematically under - predicted the osmotic pressures of the dispersions .",
    "drying experiments were then conducted in hele - shaw cells , where small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) techniques were used to measure how the particle volume fraction changes across the liquid - solid transitions of directionally - drying colloidal dispersions .",
    "we found that the numerical model of the front correctly captured much of the experimental detail , such as ( i ) the general shape of the drying front , especially for the smaller particles , ( ii ) the fact that the concentration profiles across the liquid - solid transition were stretched to be bout an order of magnitude wider than would be expected for particles with only hard - sphere interactions , and ( iii ) that this stretching of the front was stronger for larger particles .",
    "however , many of the fine details of the concentration profiles were missed .",
    "most noticeably , when the drying profiles were used to infer an effective diffusivity of the various dispersions , it was found that the colloidal particles showed a marked increase in their collective diffusivity at intermediate - to - high volume fractions , where they were behaving as a yield - stress material , like a paste or gel , rather than a simple fluid .",
    "this increase was not captured by the model , and may represent non - dlvo interactions , or non - isotropic interactions .",
    "as these colloids dry , they undergo a compression along the direction of drying .",
    "we explored the macroscopic implications of these forces in the latter part of this paper , looking at shear bands and cracks .",
    "the shear bands release the uniaxial compression of the film by allowing for slip at @xmath168 to the direction of compression .",
    "in particular , we showed that the amount of slip accommodated by any of these bands was proportional to the total amount of deviatoric strain that would have accumulated across the liquid - solid transition , had it not been relieved by the shear bands .",
    "both the appearance of shear bands , and the extent of their shear , can thus be controlled by adjusting the chemistry of the starting dispersion , before it dries .",
    "the cracks , in turn , release strain energy by allowing the dispersion to shrink more as it dries .",
    "we demonstrated that the appearance and paths of cracks could be guided by the structural anisotropy that the liquid - solid transition leaves behind .",
