    "the recent experimental techniques for trapping and cooling of the atomic vapors enabled exploration of the extremely low temperature regions where quantum effects play a crucial role .",
    "an example can be the bose einstein condensation ( bec ) produced out of the bosonic atoms in alkali metals , polarized hydrogen , etc .",
    "phase transition to the bec state is there triggered purely by the quantum statistical requirements which lead to macroscopic occupancy of the lowest energy level and can occur even in absence of any interactions .",
    "recent activities in the field of ultracold atomic systems focus on application of similar techniques to fermionic atoms like @xmath0li or @xmath1k ( besides even number of nucleons they consist of odd number of electrons ) . at ultralow temperatures",
    "such quantum effects like the pauli principle play considerable role , but eventual quantum phase transitions would be allowed only if fermionic atoms get correlated via interactions .",
    "interactions between trapped atoms are routinely induced by applying the magnetic field to fermion atoms prepared in several ( two or more ) hyperfine configurations . from elementary considerations",
    "@xcite it turns out that the involved hyperfine states experience the effective scattering described by a potential whose magnitude and sign depend on the applied field @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the various ( so called ) feshbach resonances can take place . on this basis",
    "there was proposed a mechanism of the resonance superfluidity @xcite with a transition occurring near the fermi temperature @xmath3 .",
    "besides the isotropic phase there has already been observed also the exotic @xmath4-wave superfluidity @xcite .",
    "a unique possibility of controlling the effective interactions gives a chance for the experimental realization of the bcs to bec crossover .",
    "the bcs limit corresponds to a case of weakly attracting fermion atoms which get coupled into the large cooper pairs . in opposite limit ,",
    "the tightly bound diatomic molecules are formed which ultimately can undergo transition to the bec .",
    "experimentalists are able to switch between these limits in a controllable manner and change of the interactions can be performed either adiabatically ( by slowly varying the field ) @xcite or in a non - adiabatic way ( via the sudden sweep ) @xcite .    in this short paper",
    "we investigate the quantum fluctuations induced by the time - dependent change of the interactions .",
    "we focus on a situation when the magnetic field is detuned from the resonant value @xmath5 towards the far bcs regime at higher field @xmath6 .",
    "we consider two different processes : the smooth and the sudden switching .",
    "the fast sweep has been discussed in the literature but with some ambiguous conclusions concernig evolution of the order parameters with respect to time @xcite . from our analysis",
    "we find that both parameters do oscillate in a damped way .",
    "in a close proximity to the feshbach resonance ( i.e.  when @xmath7 ) the ultracold fermion atoms coexist and interact with the diatomic molecules . on a microscopic basis this situation can be described in terms of the two component boson fermion hamiltonian @xcite @xmath8 which has been known and studied in the solid state physics by j.  ranninger and coworkers @xcite as a phenomenological model for the high temperature superconductivity . in the present context ( [ bf ] )",
    "describes the atoms in two hyperfine states denoted symbolically by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the second quantization operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 correspond to fermion atoms with energy @xmath13 and to diatomic molecules with energy @xmath14 . the effect of external magnetic field is included via the _ detuning parameter _ @xmath15 which shifts the boson energies and hence affects efficiency of the boson - fermion coupling @xmath16 @xcite . as usually @xmath17 is the common chemical potential and we use the grand canonical ensemble to ensure the conservation of the total particle number @xmath18 .    we are interested here in studying the time dependent evolution of fermion and boson occupancies together with the corresponding order parameters . for this purpose",
    "we derive the heisenberg equations of motion which for the hamiltonian ( [ bf ] ) are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and we set @xmath22 . in general equations ( [ h1]-[h4 ] )",
    "are not solvable exactly . in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss an approximate method which shall be valid for the ground state and for very low temperatures .",
    "for temperatures close to the absolute zero we can neglect the excited ( finite momentum ) boson states .",
    "it is sufficient to restrict attention to the @xmath23 boson level because it is macroscopically occupied . in such",
    "_ single mode approach _",
    "@xcite the initial hamiltonian ( [ bf ] ) reduces to @xmath24 following anderson @xcite we introduce the pseudospin notation @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] are the usual pauli operators . in the single mode approach we rewrite the heisenberg equations ( [ h1]-[h4 ] ) using the pseudospin notation @xmath28 which are identical with expressions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in the ref .",
    "one next replaces the boson operators by their time - dependent expectation values @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in the stationary case when all parameters in ( [ single_mode ] ) are time independent we can derive various expressions for the static expectation values @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ single_mode ] ) has formally the following structure @xmath31 so the pseudospin @xmath32 behaves as though affected by a fictitious magnetic field @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "following anderson @xcite we can solve this problem ( [ eq11 ] ) for arbitrary temperature .",
    "in analogy to the weiss theory of ferromagnetism we obtain that a magnitude of the pseudospin expectation value is @xmath35 . determining the angle between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 components of the vector @xmath38 we finally arrive at the stationary equations @xcite @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "in the symmetry broken state ( for @xmath41 ) the two component model ( [ bf ] ) is characterized by two order parameters : @xmath42 and another one of the fermion subsystem defined as @xmath43 .",
    "these quantities are complex . in the stationary case",
    "they are proportional to each other as can be seen from the equation ( [ mean_field1 ] ) . however , this relation is no longer valid when the hamiltonian ( [ single_mode ] ) depends on time .",
    "evolution of the order parameters @xmath42 and @xmath44 with respect to time must be determined by solving the heisenberg equations ( [ s1]-[s2 ] ) subject to some boundary conditions .",
    "we analyze here such dynamics assuming that initially , for @xmath45 , the mixed atom molecule system is exactly on the fesbach resonance @xmath46 .",
    "we also assume that the boson order parameter is real and @xmath47 so that the fermion order parameter is real too .",
    "value of @xmath48 was determined from the equation ( [ mean_field1 ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we focus on the ground state and set the boson fermion coupling @xmath16 as a unit or all the energies appearing in our study .    for time @xmath49 we change the detuning parameter @xmath15 in the following ways : a ) via the sudden detuning as previously discussed in the refs @xcite and b ) through gradually increasing @xmath50 . avoiding any constraint solutions we solved numerically the heisenberg equations ( [ s1],[s2 ] ) by means of the runge - kutta algorithm .    by increasing @xmath15 the boson fermion system",
    "is pushed to the far bcs regime . for @xmath51 at @xmath52 the order parameters @xmath42 and @xmath44 should reach very small values .",
    "figure 1 shows that indeed temporal evolution occurs into such asymptotics and practically is achieved after several oscillations . in both cases the oscillations are clearly damped in agreement with the previous study by k.  burnet and coworkers @xcite .",
    "however , this process of damping is sensitive on a particular profile of the time dependent detuning .",
    "this can be seen from the figure 1 and also in the next figure 2 , where we plot the phase @xmath53 of the boson order parameter @xmath54 . for a smooth switching",
    "the oscillations seem not to look regular at all .",
    "we studied the dynamics of the ultracold fermion atoms upon the sudden and gradual detuning from the feshbach resonance .",
    "such situation can be experimentally realized by switching the external magnetic field from @xmath5 to the higher values . from the selfconsistent numerical solution of the equations of motion we find that the order parameters start oscillating with the amplitude decaying in time .",
    "such damped oscillations depend on the specific form in which the detuning @xmath55 is carried out .",
    "we also remark that the quantum oscillations of the order parameters turn out to be damped even on the level of the single mode approach without taking into account scattering to the finite boson momenta .",
