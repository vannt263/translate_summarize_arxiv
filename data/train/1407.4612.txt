    "the most notable is the existence of a flat phase , in which the surface normals exhibit a long range order , a feature never expected for linear polymers nor fluid membranes , at finite temperature .",

    "these works emphasize the complexity in the membrane dynamics compared to the polymer  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall show that the membrane dynamics is also amenable to a simple argument developed for the polymer dynamics , provided that the anisotropy in the flat phase is properly taken into account .",

    ", we provide the first evidence that the monomer msd in the in - plane and the out - of - plane directions follow distinctive scaling behaviors , and demonstrate an excellent agreement with the dynamical scaling predictions .",
