    "the growing sample of nearly 3000 observed exoplanets with over 2500 unconfirmed candidates has revealed new and unexpected populations of planets that do not share a solar system analogue ( borucki et al .",

    "the robustness of planet formation theories can be tested in their ability to reproduce these statistically significant populations of planets on the mass semi - major axis diagram , such as super earths ( 1 - 10 m@xmath4 ) , hot neptunes ( @xmath5 10 - 30 m@xmath4 ) , hot jupiters , and 1 au jupiters @xcite .",
    "the distribution of observed planets on the mass - radius diagram adds another set of data to constrain models of planet formation .",
    "this distribution reveals a range of mean densities of planets that have similar masses @xcite , suggesting an interesting variety of chemical compositions among them .",
    "how , then , can planets that have similar masses and semi - major axes achieve such different compositions",
    "? this could arise for several reasons , such as variations in metallicities of their host stars , or the accretion of material at different locations in disks around stars with similar compositions .",
    "our work studies the latter case , whereby planet compositions are intimately linked to their formation history .    in order to track materials accreted onto a planet throughout its formation",
    ", the physical and chemical conditions throughout the protoplanetary disk it is forming within must first be modelled .",
    "one approach is to use equilibrium chemistry , whereby the gibbs free energy of the system is minimized @xcite .",
    "this technique is useful in determining chemical abundances throughout a complex system , and has been used in previous studies of disk chemistry @xcite .",
    "solid compositions are largely unaffected by non - equilibrium effects mainly due to their short equilibrium timescale @xcite , allowing for equilibrium chemistry models to obtain good estimates of condensation sequences along the disk s midplane . due to the method s ability to model solid chemistry ,",
    "this technique has largely been used to track compositions of terrestrial planets throughout their formation @xcite . however , non - equilibrium effects such as photodissociation , grain - surface reactions , and ion driven chemistry are expected to be present within protoplanetary disks @xcite and will effect gas - phase chemistry .",
    "gaseous abundances are therefore more reliably studied when taking non - equilibrium effects into consideration .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the technique to modelling planet compositions as they form in the core accretion model , a model of jovian planet formation .",
    "we focus on the compositions of super earths and hot neptunes as their masses are mainly in solids , where our chemistry method is most applicable .    the core accretion model is a bottom - up process of planet formation whereby an initially small ( @xmath6 ) planetary embryo grows by accreting @xmath5 1 - 10 km - sized planetesimals before becoming massive enough to accrete gas from the disk @xcite . as was shown in @xcite and @xcite , this model predicts the formation of massive ( 1 - 10 jupiter mass ) gas giants in average to long - lived disks ( @xmath0 2 myr ) . if the process of photoevaporation is efficient enough to disperse the disk before the planetary core can accrete substantial amounts of gas , the core will be unable to continue growing .",
    "one can recognize the failed cores that result from these short - lived disks ( @xmath7 2 myr ) as super earths and hot neptunes @xcite .",
    "the success of the core accretion model is seen in its ability to reproduce the observed distribution of planets on the mass - period diagram @xcite .",
    "one of the key processes shaping this distribution is planet migration .",
    "througout its formation , the gravitational interaction between a planet and the surrounding disk results in an exchange of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "properly accounting for migration throughout all stages of planet formation is critical to understand where in the disk a planet is forming and therefore what material it accretes .",
    "planet traps are a key feature of our core accretion model , and are used to model planet - disk interactions and radial migration throughout a large portion of planet formation .",
    "planet traps arise from inhomogeneities in disks and act as barriers to rapid type - i migration @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities we study in our model are the outer edge of the dead zone ( a transition from an mri inactive to active region ) , the ice line ( an opacity transition ) , and the heat transition ( an entropy transition ) .",
    "planet traps have been combined with a semi - analytic core accretion model in @xcite and have been shown to play a key role in reproducing the mass - period distribution of exoplanets . here , our work builds upon these previous studies and attempts to determine how planet formation in traps affects their compositions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to combine chemical models of protoplanetary disks with the core accretion model in order to account for the formation of different classes of planets as well as the chemical variety observed among super earths . after obtaining planet masses and compositions at the end of their formation ,",
    "we hope to provide initial conditions for modelling the interior structures of planets in the super earth and hot neptune population @xcite . by including the effects of trapped type - i migration",
    ", we will reveal what effect planet traps have on the compositions of planets formed in our models .    as our work combines planet formation with migration , the materials a planet accretes change with both its position and time .",
    "computing a time dependent chemical disk model offers an improvement on previous works which have limited their focus to the disk chemistry at a single time in the disk s evolution @xcite .",
    "the work we present here tracks planet formation from oligarchic growth ( core formation ) through the end of runaway gas accretion , and can be considered a global model of planet formation as it covers physical processes over a wide range of planet masses .",
    "this builds on previous works that have studied one aspect of jovian planet formation in detail , such as gas accretion , migration , or oligarchic growth ( @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we first outline our model of the physical and chemical conditions in sections 2.1 and 2.2 , respectively . with a disk model in hand",
    ", the locations of different planet traps can be calculated , and are discussed in section 2.3 . the planet formation model we use",
    "is then outlined in section 2.4 . in section 3 , we present individual planet formation tracks and resulting compositions while varying important parameters in our model such as disk mass and lifetime .",
    "we focus primarily on conditions giving rise to super earths and hot neptunes , and what range of compositions among these planets our model predicts .",
    "we leave a complete statistical treatment of this to our next paper ( alessi , pudritz , & cridland 2016 , in prep . ) .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss key implications and conclusions of our work .",
    "the core accretion model predicts that jovian planet formation occurs on a timescale of a few million years @xcite .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the viscous timescale for protoplanetary disks .",
    "therefore , the disk that a jovian planet is forming within will evolve substantially throughout its formation as accretion onto the host star takes place @xcite . due to this , we require a dynamic and evolving disk in our model to account for the changes in disk properties over the course of a planet s formation .",
    "this leads to disk chemistry being inherently time dependent , as the governing temperatures and pressures throughout the disk are decreasing .",
    "disk evolution is crucial in our model , as time - dependent physics and chemistry throughout the disk lead to planet traps sweeping through the disk , allowing planets forming within them to encounter regions with different materials available for accretion .    the analytic , 1 + 1d disk model presented in @xcite will be used throughout this paper .",
    "an analytic disk model is advantageous for our work as it allows us to efficiently calculate the conditions throughout the disk while modelling disk chemistry and planet formation .",
    "the self - similar approach adopted by @xcite simultaneously models viscously heated , active inner regions of the disk and the outer regions that are passively heated by direct irradiation of the host star . in doing so , it merges the viscous disk models that are used for planet formation @xcite with models that are aimed at reproducing observed spectra of disks @xcite that only consider heating by radiation .",
    "the @xcite model also has one of the three traps we are interested in tracking , the heat transition , built into the mathematical framework .",
    "however , it does not include the effects of an ice line or dead zone , which is a drawback of the model .",
    "to track these two traps , we use our disk chemistry ( see section 2.2 ) and ionization ( see section 2.3 ) models .",
    "we note that while we are able to use the disk structure to calculate the location of the ice line and dead zone , the back - reaction of these effects on the disk structure is not included .",
    "the disk model in @xcite gives an analytic solution to the viscous evolution equation describing the surface density profile @xmath8 of a circumstellar disk in polar coordinates , @xmath9\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the disk s viscosity .",
    "as shown in @xcite , self - similar solutions to this equation can be obtained for alpha disk models where the viscosity in the disk is taken to be proportional to the sound speed @xmath11 and disk scale height @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the effective viscosity coefficient .",
    "we expect there to be multiple sources of angular momentum transport in disks , such as by torques exerted by mhd disk winds as well as mri generated turbulence ( the latter , ourside the dead zone ) .",
    "the disk s effective @xmath14 can then be written as a sum of individual @xmath15 parameters characterizing particular angular momentum transport mechanisms .",
    "for example , in the case where disk angular momentum is transported through a combination of disk winds and mri turbulence , @xmath16 while our model uses @xmath14 values corresponding to these two means of angular momentum transport , other possible mechanisms such as the hydrodynamic zombie vortex instability @xcite can fit within this framework by adding subsequent @xmath14 parameters to equation [ sumalpha ] .",
    "the activity of the mri instability depends on the ionization rates throughout the disk , discussed in detail in section 2.3 . in the mri active regions of the disk , @xmath17 , whereas it is @xmath18 in the mri inactive regions ( referred to as the dead zone ) .",
    "it has been shown recently in @xcite and @xcite that disk winds can maintain disk accretion rates through the mri dead zones in disks .",
    "we therefore make the assumption that the disk s effective @xmath14 is a constant throughout the disk with a particular value of @xmath19 used .",
    "the @xcite model describes disk evolution under the influence of only viscous processes .",
    "an additional source of disk evolution is expected to be caused by high energy radiation from the protostar slowly dispersing the disk material , known as photoevaporation @xcite . as was shown in @xcite , viscous evolution alone",
    "can not reproduce the mass - period distribution of observed exoplanets , and results in low - mass planets being formed too far from their host stars .",
    "photoevaporation s gradual removal of material acts as a means to accelerate disk evolution in the viscous framework .",
    "this allows planets to migrate inwards on a shorter timescale , forming planet populations consistent with exoplanet data , such as super earths and hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , we make the following modification to the disk accretion rate presented in @xcite , @xmath20 which includes an exponentially decaying factor which models photoevaporation s effect on the disk s viscous evolution . in the above equation , @xmath21 is the disk accretion rate at initial time @xmath22 years , @xmath23 years is the depletion timescale , and @xmath24 is the viscous timescale , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the disk s mass at time @xmath27 .",
    ".constants used in the chambers disk model . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ saturatetable ]    this timescale approach is an order - of - magnitude estimate of where the corotation torque saturates .",
    "furthermore , the results we obtain depend on the values of parameters , for example @xmath28 . while the results in this section show that this approach predicts that the corotation torque will not saturate during type - i migration with the current choices of parameters , a higher setting of @xmath28 will lead to the corotation torque saturating slightly before gap formation takes place .",
    "we predict , however , that the difference between m@xmath29 and m@xmath30 will be roughly a few tenths m@xmath4 for planet tracks in our model , making the saturated corotation torque phase short - lived .",
    "this will limit the effect that corotation torque saturation can have on planet tracks presented in this paper .",
    "the planet tracks computed using our model are qualitatively similar to those presented in @xcite during early phases of planet formation .",
    "we note , however , that their model includes the effects of multiple type - i migration sub - regimes in addition to the trapped phase .",
    "the other two sub - regimes ( the locally isothermal regime and the saturated corotation torque regime ) can cause the planet to undergo rapid inward migration or outward migration on timescales shorter than the disk s viscous timescale .",
    "this contrasts with the trapped inward migration on the viscous timescale planets in our model undergo .",
    "the following algorithm is used to track planets compositions throughout their formation .",
    "a time step of @xmath31 years is used during our planet formation runs .    1 . : :    initial conditions : 0.01 m@xmath4 planet core at a    radius coinciding with a planet trap at 10@xmath32 years .",
    "the    solid mass abundances in the disk at the planet s location are scaled    up to 0.01 m@xmath4 to obtain the planet s initial    composition .",
    "2 . : :    update the planet s orbital radius , @xmath33 , due to the    inward migration during @xmath34 . this could be either    due to the planet trap moving inwards , or , for high mass planets , to    type ii migration .",
    "steps 3 through 8 are skipped if the planet is in    stage iv of its formation ( accretion has stopped ) .",
    "3 . : :    calculate the disk s temperature , pressure , and surface density at    @xmath35 and the time into the disk s lifetime .",

    ": :    the amount of solid substances in the planet is updated using the    local abundances of solids ,    @xmath40    steps 7 and 8 can be skipped if the planet in stage i    ( @xmath41 ) 7 .",
