    "the outstanding performance of the lhc experiments has led the field of high energy physics into unprecedented territory in the energy and luminosity frontier .",
    "major discoveries at the tera - scale are highly anticipated .",
    "one of the primary motivations for lhc experiments is the exploration for the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . among the many possibilities for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , supersymmetry ( susy ) provides a natural framework for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "although the signals for susy are still elusive at the lhc , significant progress has been made in the search for the higgs boson .",
    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations have reported their updated searches for the sm higgs boson @xcite . continuously extending the previous lep2 mass bound for a sm higgs ( 114.4 gev ) @xcite ,",
    "the lhc search has reached an impressively wide coverage for the mass parameters .",
    "the main conclusions are    * a sm - like higgs boson was excluded at @xmath11 c.l .  in the mass range of @xmath12 gev , in @xmath13 gev @xmath14 gev @xcite and in @xmath15 gev@xmath16 gev @xcite , thus leaving a @xmath11 c.l .",

    "although inconclusive with the current data , each one of the statements above has significant impact on our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking and thus guides us for the next step of the higgs search .    in this paper",
    ", we study the consequences of the above findings on the higgs sector within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "we first recollect the existing constraints from all the current bounds of the direct searches from lep2 @xcite , the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite .",
    "if we accept the existence of a cp - even higgs boson in the mass range of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mh1 ] ) as observed in the @xmath1 mode , we then find very interesting features for the mssm higgs sector and some other relevant susy parameters .",
    "there are two distinctive scenarios , both of which incorporate a sm - like higgs boson .    *  decoupling \" regime with @xmath22 gev @xcite : the light cp - even higgs @xmath23 is in the mass range of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mh1 ] ) and sm - like .",
    "the non - sm - like higgs bosons ( heavy cp - even state @xmath24 , cp - odd state @xmath25 and the charged state @xmath26 ) are all heavy and nearly degenerate , with masses around @xmath27 . *  non - decoupling \" regime with @xmath28 around @xmath29 gev : the heavy cp - even higgs @xmath24 is in the mass range of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mh1 ] ) and sm - like , while the light cp - even higgs @xmath23 is non - sm - like .",
    "the masses of the light cp - even higgs and the cp - odd higgs are nearly degenerate while the charged higgs is nearly degenerate with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "each of these two cases predicts unique signatures to establish the nature of the mssm at the lhc .",
    "while the current searches continue to improve in the future runs and the standard electroweak production processes @xmath31 are still available , we would like to point out the potential importance of the electroweak processes @xmath32 which are via pure gauge interaction and independent of the susy parameters except for their masses .",
    "in addition , there may be sizable contributions from @xmath33 in the low - mass non - decoupling region , which may be used to distinguish the model - parameters .    on the other hand , due to the strong positive correlation between the higgs decays to @xmath3 and to @xmath4 predicted in the mssm , the observed @xmath4 signal and the apparent absence of the @xmath3 final state signal near the peak would be mutually exclusive to each other .",
    "namely , the suppression of the @xmath3 channel would automatically reduce the @xmath4 channel , in direct conflict with the observed @xmath4 excess .",
    "we also found another interesting inverse correlation between the higgs decays to @xmath3 and to @xmath34 . in this case , the suppression to the @xmath3 channel would automatically force the @xmath34 channel to be bigger .",
    "if the deficit in the @xmath3 channel persists and the result is strengthened for an extended mass range in the future run at the lhc , it would imply that the sm - like higgs boson has reduced couplings to @xmath35 , rendering it less sm - like .",
    "consequently , the other non - sm - like higgs bosons can not be deeply into the decoupling regime , and thus can not be too heavy , typically below 350 gev , making them more accessible at the lhc .",
    "moreover , if the excess in the @xmath4 channel and the absence of an excess in the @xmath3 channel continue to be strengthened at the lhc , new physics beyond the mssm will be required could help to enhance the branching fraction of the @xmath36 channel . ] .    in the current study",
    ", we wish to focus on the essentials of the higgs sector in the mssm and to minimize the effects from other susy sectors @xcite . nevertheless , a few other susy parameters , the higgs mixing @xmath37 , the stop mixing @xmath38 and the stop soft susy masses @xmath39 and @xmath40 , play crucial roles in the higgs sector .",
    "we explore the effects of the higgs searches on those susy parameters by scanning them in a wide range and we find clear correlations and thus predictions on them .",

    "<S> the recent results on higgs boson searches from lhc experiments provide significant guidance in exploring the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model ( mssm ) higgs sector . if we accept the existence of a sm - like higgs boson in the mass window of 123 gev@xmath0127 gev as indicated by the observed @xmath1 events , there are two distinct mass regions ( in @xmath2 ) left in the mssm higgs sector : ( a ) the lighter cp - even higgs boson being sm - like and the non - sm - like higgs bosons all heavy and nearly degenerate above 300 gev ( an extended decoupling region ) ; ( b ) the heavier cp - even higgs boson being sm - like and the neutral non - sm - like higgs bosons all nearly degenerate around 100 gev ( a small non - decoupling region ) . on </S>",
    "<S> the other hand , due to the strong correlation between the higgs decays to @xmath3 and to @xmath4 predicted in the mssm , the apparent absence of a @xmath3 final state signal is in direct conflict with the @xmath4 peak . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider the @xmath3 channel on its own , the absence of the @xmath3 signal would imply that the sm - like higgs boson has reduced coupling to @xmath5 , and that the other non - sm - like higgs bosons should not be too heavy and do not decouple . </S>",
    "<S> if both the @xmath4 excess and the absence of a @xmath3 signal continue , new physics beyond the mssm will be required . a similar correlation exists between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels : a reduced @xmath6 channel would force the @xmath7 channel to be larger . future searches for the sm - like higgs boson at the lhc will provide critical tests for the mssm prediction </S>",
    "<S> . we also study the signals predicted for the non - sm - like higgs bosons and emphasize the potential importance of the electroweak processes @xmath8 , which are independent of the susy parameters except for their masses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there may be sizable contributions from @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the low - mass non - decoupling region , which may serve to discriminate the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we allow variations of the relevant susy parameters in a broad range and demonstrate the correlations and constraints on these parameters and associated susy particles . </S>"
