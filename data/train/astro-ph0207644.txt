    "astrophysical disks are either stellar or gaseous .",
    "the existence of non - axisymmetric equilibrium states of such systems has been attractive both from theoretical and observational aspects .",
    "the search for dynamical equilibria of stellar systems is known as the self - consistency problem where one seeks for a positive phase space distribution function ( df ) that produces the density of the model and satisfies the collisionless boltzmann equation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . the construction of the df can be done by analytical means or numerical exploration based on schwarzschild s orbit superposition method ( schwarzschild 1979 ; kuijken 1993 , hereafter k93 ; levine & sparke 1998 ; teuben 1987 ; de zeeuw , hunter , & schwarzschild 1987 ; jalali & de zeeuw 2002 , hereafter jz ) .",
    "the main difficulty linked to the self - consistency problem is the lack of the second integral of motion for most planar models .",
    "gaseous disks , however , are investigated through solving the hydrodynamic equations of compressible , self - gravitating fluids .",
    "there are several works in the literature that deal with the stability of perturbed axisymmetric gaseous disks ( heemskerk , papaloizou , & savonije 1992 ; goodman & evans 1999 ; lemos , kalnajs , & lynden - bell 1991 ) .",
    "the problem of non - axisymmetric systems is somewhat different because our knowledge is limited even about equilibrium states .",
    "following a first - order linear theory , syer & tremaine ( 1996 , hereafter st96 ) constructed simple scale - free disks and approximately solved the steady - state hydrodynamic equations for the components of the velocity vector .",
    "they also proposed a nonlinear theory based on the calculation of fourier coefficients using newton s method .",
    "a similar strategy was adopted by galli et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter g01 ) in the study of isothermal molecular clouds and the fragmentation hypothesis of multiple stars .",
    "their nonlinear solutions , in contrast with st96 , were generated by direct numerical integration of reduced ordinary differential equations ( ode ) and an iterative scheme to match the boundary conditions .",
    "these methods of approach seem inefficient when one seeks for global properties of highly non - axisymmetric equilibria and the transient response of fluid disks in the vicinity of such states .",
    "therefore , finding analytical solutions for the hydrodynamic equations is of special interest even in the steady - state conditions .    in this paper",
    "we explore exact non - axisymmetric solutions of self - similar gaseous disks with flat rotation curves . in ",
    "2 we express the governing equations and reduce them to a third - order ode in  3 where we also introduce our _ closed - form _ analytic solutions .",
    "we construct hydrodynamical counterparts of the jz models in  4 and apply our results to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in  5 .",
    "we show that the kinematics of the lmc can be explained by our model elliptic disks .",
    "we end up with conclusions in  6 .",
    "we consider a thin disk of compressible , inviscid self - gravitating fluid in a steady state ( dynamical equilibrium ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations can be written as the time - independent continuity equation @xmath0 and the momentum equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the polar coordinates , @xmath3 is the velocity field in eulerian description , and @xmath4 is the pressure .",
    "the potential @xmath5 is due to the self - gravity , which is related to the surface density @xmath6 through the poisson integral @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant . in the following section , we attempt to simplify the governing equations for scale - free disks and solve the resulting equations by analytical means",
    "gaseous disks with logarithmic potentials possess the astrophysically important property of a flat rotation curve .",
    "the circular gaseous disks having this property are known as mestel ( 1963 ) disks , the stability of which was investigated by goodman & evans ( 1999 ) . here",
    "we derive _ exact analytical _",
    "expressions for the physical quantities of non - axisymmetric disks .",
    "we assume cuspy , scale - free potential  density pairs of the form @xmath9 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\sigma ( r,\\phi ) \\ ! & = & \\ ! { \\sigma_0 f(\\phi ) \\over r } , \\label{eq::potential - density - pairs } \\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants .",
    "the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14-periodic in @xmath15 because they are continuous .",
    "we normalize the surface density so that @xmath16 this transfers the scaling of @xmath6 to @xmath11 ( e.g. , g01 ) and implies @xmath17 . given @xmath18 , poisson s integral does not usually lead to a closed - form expression for @xmath19 and one has to adopt a series solution .",
    "let us assume that @xmath12 admits the fourier expansion @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constant coefficients .",
    "using eqs ( a1 ) and ( a5 ) of st96 , we find the potentials corresponding to single fourier modes and superpose the results .",
    "this gives @xmath23 we prescribe @xmath18 and determine @xmath19 through the scheme mentioned above .",
    "then , we attempt to solve the momentum equations for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the pressure @xmath4 in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the velocity components can be derived from the stream function @xmath26 as @xmath27 the scale - freeness of the model suggests the ansatz @xmath28 , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a constant reference velocity that will become the circular velocity if the disk is axisymmetric ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "we utilize eqs ( [ eq::potential - density - pairs ] ) through ( [ eq::stream - fnc ] ) and take the curl of eqs ( [ eq::r - equation ] ) and ( [ eq::theta - equation ] ) .",
    "this eliminates the pressure @xmath4 and leaves us with the following ode for @xmath32 @xmath33 p^{\\prime } = \\beta f \\big ( fg^{\\prime}+2f^{\\prime } \\big ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a dimensionless parameter and the prime denotes @xmath35 .",
    "the solution @xmath32 will result in the velocity field of our planar self - gravitating fluids .",
    "physical solutions of ( [ eq::p - equation - isothermal ] ) correspond to the condition @xmath36 , which ensures the continuity of velocity field .",
    "hence , we seek for @xmath14-periodic solutions of @xmath32 .      carrying out a change of dependent variable as ( this is indeed liouville s transformation explained in appendix a ) @xmath37 eq .",

    "v_{\\phi } \\!\\!\\!\\ ! & = & \\!\\!\\!\\ ! { v_{\\phi } \\over f(\\phi)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which one can obtain @xmath32 .",
    "it is now straightforward to determine the pressure @xmath4 from either ( [ eq::r - equation ] ) or ( [ eq::theta - equation ] ) as @xmath49= c_s^2 \\sigma,\\ ] ] where @xmath50,\\ ] ] is the square of the sound speed ( at the azimuth @xmath15 ) and @xmath51.\\ ] ] sound waves are stable if @xmath52 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath53 . define @xmath54 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the positiveness of @xmath4 will be @xmath55 apart from constraining the admissible values of @xmath56 , this condition may put some restrictions on the model parameters . as it can be seen in ( [ eq::velocity - field - isothermal ] ) ,",
    "@xmath25 is maximum ( minimum ) where the surface density is minimum ( maximum ) .",
    "this result has previously been used in the construction of dfs of stellar systems using schwarzschild s orbit superposition method ( e.g. , k93 ; jz ) .",
    "our scale - free analytical solutions are general .",
    "they are independent of special angular variation of surface density and its corresponding potential .",
    "our solutions can be used even in the presence of an external force that falls off as steep as @xmath57 .",
    "such a force can be that of a magnetic field or the gravitational influence of a dark matter halo .",
    "these effects can enter in our equations through @xmath58 .    the most important point related to our solutions",
    "is the existence of transonic flows . according to ( [ eq::sound - speed ] ) , it is possible to obtain entirely subsonic , transonic , and entirely supersonic flows depending on the choice of @xmath59 in the range @xmath60 .",
    "let us define the mach number @xmath61 which is a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath15 in our disks . for convenience , we use the variable @xmath62 for the classification of flows .",
    "disks with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) for @xmath65 $ ] are entirely supersonic ( subsonic ) and our steady - state models are credible .",
    "flows for which @xmath66 switches sign along a streamline , are transonic . in such a circumstance , steady - state models become problematic as explained below . in principle , transition from subsonic to supersonic speeds ( along a streamline ) can take place smoothly , but the reverse is impossible without assuming a shock wave . because fluid elements in the subsonic part of a streamline , have not information from the arrival of the particles in the supersonic upstream .",
    "therefore , they suddenly find themselves collided with these particles . after a while , these interactions develop a shock wave and the speed of supersonic stream discontinuously decreases to a subsonic value .",
    "this process is inherently time - dependent and it increases entropy and generates heat .",
    "thus , we must cautiously deal with any transonic solution .",
    "galli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also argue that models with transonic flows will most likely be unstable . despite these arguments",
    ", there is an exceptional case in nature where a supersonic flowfield is isentropically ( and of course smoothly ) compressed from supersonic to subsonic speeds . that is the famous _ conical flow _",
    "detailed description of which can be found in anderson ( 1990 , chapter 10 ) . in this very special case , again , a shock wave still presents but the _ sonic line _ does not coincide with the shock ray .",
    "the latter completely lies in the supersonic region .    in any case",
    ", it seems reasonable to exclude transonic solutions from our results",
    ". a stability analysis will surely provide much insight into the problem .",
    "the instabilities of our non - axisymmetric disks will be resolved in a future paper .    for axisymmetric disks ,",
    "the parameter @xmath67 is obtained in terms of mach number through @xmath68 in this case , @xmath69 is independent of @xmath15 and the transition from subsonic to supersonic flows occurs at @xmath70 .",
    "we now apply our analytical tool to certain non - axisymmetric models for which we have either observational evidence or stellar dynamical counterparts .",
    "the simplest form of non - axisymmetric disks is obtained when a circular disk is perturbed by a single fourier mode as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath15-dependence of the potential will become @xmath73 one can readily verify that the condition ( [ eq::necessary - conditions - w ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath74 and from ( [ eq::velocity - field - isothermal ] ) we find @xmath75 it is not difficult to show that @xmath76 is positive for our simple disks when @xmath72 .",
    "these disks are analogous to the multiple - lobed disks of g01 .",
    "but they are not the same .",
    "the difference can be traced back to the logic of solving the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamic equations for self - gravitating disks are four equations for the five unknowns @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we are free to specify one of these variables , or put an extra constraint on them .",
    "galli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) follow the latter approach and assume an equation of state in the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the constant sound speed .",
    "they numerically solve their problem for @xmath6 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 , and obtain @xmath5 through poisson s equation .",
    "our disks , however , are constructed relying on another approach .",
    "we prescribe the surface density @xmath6 and find @xmath5 using poisson s integral .",
    "then , we determine @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath4 . our disks , in contrast to g01 , are not isothermal [ because the sound speed is not constant according to ( [ eq::sound - speed ] ) ] .",
    "nonetheless , our solutions are exact and we never face the convergence problem as g01 .    in figure 1 , we have surveyed the @xmath79 parameter space of our simple disks for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and several choices of the wavenumber @xmath82 . for each @xmath82 , we obtain a curve ( showed by solid , dashed , and dash - dotted lines ) which is the boundary of models with transonic flowfields .",
    "the region to the up side of each curve ( indicated by the letter b ) corresponds to the models that are transonic along a typical streamline .",
    "below the boundary curve , we obtain entirely subsonic and entirely supersonic regions . excluding transonic solutions ( they are unphysical due to arguments in  [ subsec : velocity - component ] ) , highly non - axisymmetric disks can be constructed in the subsonic region as the wavenumber @xmath82",
    "is increased .",
    "the maximum elongation of the lopsided mode ( @xmath83 ) occurs for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "whatever the value of @xmath82 may be , the maximum value of @xmath67 is @xmath86 for entirely subsonic models .",
    "entirely supersonic models are approximately circular with @xmath87 .",
    "there are two interesting families of bisymmetric disks for which self - consistent stellar dynamical models are known .",
    "they are the power - law and elliptic disks ( jz ) .",
    "disks whose equipotentials are similar concentric ellipses , are called the power - law disks .",
    "they are planar analogs of the logarithmic ellipsoidal models ( e.g. , binney 1981 ; evans , carollo & de zeeuw 2000 ) .",
    "the power - law disks with flat rotation curves take the potential of the form ( [ eq::potential - density - pairs ] ) with @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the axial ratio of equipotentials .",
    "the angular dependence of the surface density corresponding to ( [ eq::potential - power - law - disk ] ) has been derived in jz as the following convergent series @xmath90 \\right \\ } ,    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . in this relation",
    ", @xmath94 is the kronecker delta and we have defined @xmath95 if @xmath96 is odd , and @xmath97 if @xmath96 is even .    when the isodensity contours are similar concentric ellipses , we attain elliptic disks with @xmath98 where @xmath89 is the axis ratio of isodensity contours .",
    "stellar elliptic disks were constructed ( for the first time ) in k93 and then were examined for self - consistency by the curvature condition in jz .",
    "the potential function associated with ( [ eq::density - elliptic - disk ] ) was determined by evans & de zeeuw ( 1992 , eq .",
    "5.2 ) in terms of an indefinite integral , but a practical way is to generate it using the scheme presented in ",
    "[ subsec : stream - function ] .",
    "we find @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "all the series introduced so far , rapidly converge using only the first few terms .    for instance",
    ", we have computed the isodensity contours and streamlines of our bisymmetric disks for @xmath102 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , which result in @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the power - law and elliptic disks , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the results of our calculations for several choices of @xmath29 .",
    "solid lines are the isodensity contours and dashed lines are streamlines . for the small values of @xmath29 ,",
    "the pressure increases and dominates centrifugal forces .",
    "therefore , streamlines become highly dimpled in both disks ( panels 2_a _ and 2_c _ ) . as the value of @xmath29",
    "is increased ( @xmath105 , i.e. , @xmath106 ) , centrifugal forces overwhelm the pressure forces and keep the fluid particles away from the center .",
    "this causes streamlines to become rounder ( panels 2_b _ and 2_d _ ) .",
    "numerical computations show that @xmath76 ( @xmath107 ) is positive for the power - law and elliptic disks in the range @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , it is always possible to find a physical value for @xmath29 .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath109 parameter space of the power - law and elliptic disks .",
    "the region filled by dots corresponds to models with transonic flowfields .",
    "they are most likely unphysical models as we discussed in  [ subsec : velocity - component ] .",
    "hence , we exclude them from our solution space . as figure 3 shows , supersonic elliptic disks can be more elongated than supersonic power - law disks . in both cases",
    "the maximum value of @xmath67 for subsonic flows is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "this is a generic property of our self - gravitating gaseous disks inherited from simple disks .",
    "another remarkable point is the limit of the axis ratio @xmath89 for plausible models ( transonic models excluded ) .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath89 is almost 0.4 in elliptic disks but in the case of power - law disks one can see a narrow subsonic region with @xmath110 . in the limit of @xmath111 ,",
    "these highly elongated models converge to a needle .",
    "the results for elliptic disks are similar to the findings of jz for stellar disks .",
    "in fact , stellar elliptic disks with @xmath112 are non - self - consistent . on the evidence of figure 3_a _ ,",
    "gaseous power - law disks exhibit significantly different features compared to their stellar counterparts that can not be self - consistent if @xmath113 ( jz ) .",
    "our calculations show that the gas pressure of elliptic disks approximately takes an axisymmetric distribution when @xmath29 is small . as a result",
    ", the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath114 will inversely be proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "this property does not depend on the choice of @xmath89 and it predicts a correlation between the photometric and spectroscopic data of elliptic disks when centrifugal forces are dominated by internal stresses .",
    "in his recent study of the lmc , van der marel ( 2001 ) has shown that the lmc disk is elongated and its isophotal lines are well fitted by ellipses . since the lmc has an approximately flat rotation curve , our elliptic disks ( presented in  [ sec : bisymmetric ] ) can be applied to model the lmc disk .",
    "the most recent studies of the kinematics of gas and discrete tracers ( like carbon stars ) of the lmc ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ; alves & nelson 2000 ) show that the line of maximum velocity gradient is in the range @xmath115 , which differs from the angular position of the line of nodes ( @xmath116 ) by @xmath117 .",
    "noting the fact that the intrinsic ellipticity of the lmc disk is @xmath118 in outer regions , van der marel ( 2001 ) argues that @xmath119 is possible but it is hard to believe that @xmath120 can be as large as @xmath121 .",
    "he ascribes the excess of computed misalignment to the center - of - mass and rigid - body motions of the lmc .",
    "a more accurate kinematic analysis of the lmc predicts a value of @xmath120 as small as @xmath122 ( van der marel 2002 , private communication ) . to provide a theoretical framework for these observations",
    ", we have modeled the outer region of the lmc using our elliptic disks .",
    "we have calculated the position angle of the maximum line - of - sight velocity of our elliptic disks , given the viewing angles @xmath116 and @xmath123 that were determined by van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) .",
    "our results have been shown in figure 2 .",
    "this figure illustrates the variation of @xmath120 versus @xmath67 for several choices of @xmath124 including @xmath125 , which is the intrinsic ellipticity of the lmc at large radii .",
    "a discontinuity occurs in the graph of @xmath126 ( let us say at @xmath127 ) because of a sudden change in the morphology of streamlines . for @xmath128",
    ", streamlines are dimpled .",
    "the graph for @xmath125 ( filled squares ) shows that @xmath120 varies between @xmath129 and @xmath130 when streamlines are not dimpled .",
    "interestingly , this result is in harmony with the predictions of van der marel ( 2001 ) .",
    "it is remarked that for @xmath131 we obtain @xmath132 . as @xmath133 ,",
    "streamlines become almost circular independent of the value of @xmath134 .",
    "in such a circumstance , the position angle of the maximum line - of - sight velocity coincides with that of the line of nodes , i.e. @xmath135 , as expected .",
    "based on the available observational data and our results for @xmath125 , we conclude that our scale - free elliptic disks ( with flat rotation curves ) can explain the kinematics of the outer region of the lmc if @xmath67 is chosen in the range @xmath136 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath67 comes from the fact that our transonic solutions are not reliable answers of steady - state equations . for @xmath137",
    ", we find @xmath138 , which is well within the acceptable range . moreover , models with @xmath133 ( they are supersonic ) lead to very high fluctuations of the pressure , and therefore , velocity dispersion",
    ". this does not seem to be relevant to a stable model .",
    "we also rule out the possibility of @xmath139 , for it gives @xmath140 , which is not observed .",
    "furthermore , the condition @xmath141 at the boundary of the lmc disk is inconsistent with a pressure - dominated model .",
    "exact equilibrium solutions of self - gravitating systems are rare",
    ". two classes of such solutions were found by medvedev & narayan ( 2000 ) for three - dimensional , axisymmetric isothermal systems .",
    "a generalization of these solutions for non - axisymmetric rotating systems was then introduced by shadmehri & ghanbari ( 2001 ) .",
    "although the density distribution of their models is non - axisymmetric , the velocity field has only the toroidal component .",
    "this makes their models too simple to be used in the study of fully three - dimensional non - axisymmetric distributions of matter .    in a systematic search for non - axisymmetric equilibrium solutions",
    ", we started our study from gaseous disks because they inherit many properties of three - dimensional systems . using the benefit of the existence of a stream function",
    ", we were successful in reducing the governing equations of scale - free models to an incomplete linear ode for the angular part of the stream function .",
    "it then became clear that liouville s transformation can reduce the obtained ode to a second - order inhomogeneous ode , which is similar to that of a forced harmonic oscillator .",
    "this was striking because it led us to derive closed - form solutions for the radial velocity component , stream function and the pressure @xmath4 .",
    "in fluid mechanics , transport equations are written for mass , momentum and energy . while the pressure occurs in governing equations",
    ", there is no extra independent equation in order to determine @xmath4 .",
    "the problem is rather difficult in the presence of an anisotropic stress tensor , which is encountered in turbulence and jeans equations of stellar hydrodynamics .",
    "taking the curl of momentum equations is a trick that temporarily removes the pressure from our calculations of the stream function .",
    "but , one should take care of the sign of @xmath4 once it is eventually extracted from momentum equations .",
    "only a positive pressure distribution is physical because a fluid medium can resist against a compressive stress not a tensional one .",
    "non - axisymmetric stellar disks have necessarily anisotropic dfs and pressure tensors .",
    "this point is the main difference between the physics of a steady - state gaseous disk and its stellar counterpart described by jeans equations . nevertheless , isotropic pressure distribution is not an obstacle for the existence of non - axisymmetric , self - gravitating gaseous disks as we showed in  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "our scale - free elliptic disks were used to model the outer part of the lmc disk .",
    "the main restriction of our modeling is the isotropy of the stress tensor .",
    "we speculate that our results will not be changed in a significant way if the model is stellar with an anisotropic pressure .",
    "the other important issue is the perturbation of the galaxy .",
    "the tidal field of the galaxy induces a force whose @xmath142-distribution is totally different from that of a logarithmic potential field .",
    "however , if the tidal field of the galaxy was dominant , the rotation curve of the lmc would show substantial deviation from flatness .",
    "but , we know that the rotation curve of the lmc is almost flat . therefore , our isolated models provide acceptable _ zeroth - order _ solutions .",
    "such a modeling of the lmc is a quick route for interpreting the observational data .",
    "it is obvious that taking the tidal effects into account , will destroy the enjoyable scale - free nature of our disks .",
    "we thank tim de zeeuw for useful comments and drawing our attention to the possible application of our findings to the lmc .",
    "we are indebted to an anonymous referee for enlightening suggestions that helped us to substantially improve the presentation of our results .",

    "<S> we introduce exact analytical solutions of the steady - state hydrodynamic equations of scale - free , self - gravitating gaseous disks with flat rotation curves . </S>",
    "<S> we express the velocity field in terms of a stream function and obtain a third - order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for the angular part of the stream function . </S>",
    "<S> we present the closed - form solutions of the obtained ode and construct hydrodynamical counterparts of the power - law and elliptic disks , for which self - consistent stellar dynamical models are known . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the kinematics of the large magellanic cloud can well be explained by our findings for scale - free elliptic disks . </S>"
