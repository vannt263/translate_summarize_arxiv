    "<S> we study spin - resolved resonant tunneling in a system of two quantum dots sandwiched between doped quantum wells . in the coherent ( dicke ) regime , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , when quantum dot separation is smaller than the fermi wavelength in a two - dimensional electron gas in quantum wells , application of an in - plane magnetic field leads to a pronounced spin - resolved structure of conductance peak lineshape even for very small zeeman splitting of the quantum dots resonant levels . in the presence of electron - gas spin - orbit coupling , </S>",
    "<S> this spin - resolved structure is washed out due to fermi surface deformation in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that aharonov - bohm flux penetrating the area enclosed by tunneling electron pathways completely destroys the conductance spin structure . </S>"
