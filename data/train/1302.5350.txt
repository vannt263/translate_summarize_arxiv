    "the _ spontaneous parametric down conversion _ ( spdc ) is a nonlinear optical process [ 1 ] in which a laser pump ( p ) beam incident on a nonlinear crystal leads to the emission of a correlated pair of photons called signal ( s ) and idler ( i ) .",

    "the spdc effects ( 1)-(3 ) can be identified as being directly connected with the @xmath7-_second - order nonlinear effects _ called in general _ three wave mixing _ ( see _  _ ref.[5 ] _ ) .",
    "_ the process ( 1 ) is just the _ inverse of second - harmonic generation , _ while , the effects ( 2)-(3 ) can be interpreted just as emission of _ optical phase conjugated replicas _ in the presence of pump laser via _ three wave mixing . _    in this paper a new kind of geometric optics called _ quantum spdc - geometric optics _ is systematically _  _ developed by using _",

    "in the spdc processes ( 1 ) the energy and momentum of photons are conserved :    @xmath8    moreover , if the crossing spdc - processes ( 2)-(3 ) are interpreted just as emission of _ optical phase conjugated replicas _ in the presence of input pump laser then eqs .",

    "for an experimental test of _ the gauss like law of the thin lens combined with a plane spdc - qm _ we propose an experiment based on a detailed setup presented in fig . 4 and in the optical geometric configuration shown in fig .",

    "indeed , in these recent experiments , inspired by the papers of klyshko et al ( see refs . quoted in [ 9 ] ) , was demonstrated some unusual _ two - photon effects _ , which looks very strange from classical point of view .",
    "so , in these experiments , an argon ion laser is used to pump a nonlinear bbo crystal ( @xmath91 to produce pairs of _ orthogonally polarized photons _ ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] for detailed experimental setup ) . after the separation of the _ signal _ and _  idler _ beams , an aperture ( mask ) placed in front of one of the detectors ( d@xmath47 )",
    "is illuminated by the _ signal beam _ through a convex lens .",
    "the surprising result consists from the fact that an image of this aperture is observed in coincidence counting rate by scanning the other detector ( d@xmath20 ) in the transverse plane of the idler beam , even though both detectors single counting rates remain constants . for understanding the physics involved in their experiment they presented an ",
    "equivalent  scheme ( in fig . 3 in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] ) of the experimental setup . by comparison of their  scheme",
    " with our optical configuration from fig .",
    "2b we can identify that the observed validity of the _ two - photon _ _ gaussian thin - lens equation _",
    "@xmath92    as well as of the _  linear magnification _",
    "@xmath93 can be just explained by our results on the two - photon geometric law ( 10)-(11 ) _ of the thin lens combined with a plane spdc - qm _ for the degenerate case @xmath94 therefore , the general tests of the predictions ( 10)-(11 ) using a setup described in fig . 4 , are of great importance not only in measurements in presence of the signal laser ls ( with and without coincidences between ls and idler detector d@xmath95 but also in the measurements in which instead of the laser ls we put the a signal detector d@xmath47 in coincidence with d@xmath70",
    "in this paper the class of the _ spdc - phenomena _ ( 1 ) is enriched by the introducing the _ crossing symmetric _ _ spdc - processes _ ( 2)-(3 ) satisfying the same energy - momentum conservation law ( 4 ) .",
    "consequently , the kinematical correlations ( 4)-(8 ) in conjunction with the snellius relations ( 7 ) allow us to introduce a new kind of optical devices called _ quantum mirrors .",
    "_ then , some laws of the _ quantum mirrors , _ such as : _  _ law ( 9 ) of _ thin plane spdc - quantum mirror , _ the _ law _ ( 10)-(11 ) _ of the thin lens combined with a plane spdc - qm , _ as well as , _  the laws ( 16)-(19 ) , _ _  _ are proved .",
    "these results are natural steps towards a _ new geometric optics _ which can be constructed for the kinematical correlated spdc - photons .",
    "in particular , the results obtained here are found in a very good agreement with the recent results [ 8 ] on _ two - photon imaging experiment_. moreover , we recall that _  _ all the results obtained in the _ two - photon ghost interference - diffraction _ experiment [ 6 ] was recently explained by using the concept of _ quantum mirrors ( _ see ref . [ 3 ] ) .",
