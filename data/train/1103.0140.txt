    "there is accumulated evidence both from astrophysics and cosmology that about 1/4 of the energy budget of the universe consists of so called dark matter , namely a component which is non - relativistic and neither feels the electromagnetic nor the strong interaction . for a review on dark matter",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "although the list of possible dark matter candidates is long ( for a nice list see  @xcite ) , it is fair to say that the most popular dark matter candidate is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric models with r - parity conservation  @xcite . for supersymmetry and supergravity",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model that solves the mu problem  @xcite is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite . if we do not consider the axion  @xcite and the axino  @xcite , the superpartners that have the right properties for playing the role of cold dark matter in the universe are the gravitino and the lightest neutralino . by far",
    "the most discussed case in the literature is the case of the neutralino ( see the classic review  @xcite ) , probably because of the prospects of detection .",
    "however , in the case is which neutralino is assumed to be the only dark matter component , one has to face the fine - tuning problem and the gravitino problem  @xcite . in most of the parameter space",
    "the neutralino relic density turns out to be either too small or too large  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unstable gravitinos will undergo late - time cascade decays to a neutralino lsp .",
    "these decays will destroy the light element abundances built up in bbn , unless @xmath0  gev  @xcite , which poses serious difficulties to the thermal leptogenesis scenario  @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , gravitino is the lsp and therefore stable , playing the role of cold dark matter in the universe , it is then the neutralino that will undergo late time decays into gravitino and hadrons , and the gravitino problem is re - introduced  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the degenerate scenario  @xcite the bbn and cmb constraints are avoided , and high values of the reheating temperature are obtained compatible with thermal leptogenesis . here",
    "we focus on the scenario in which the masses of the gravitino lsp and neutralino nlsp are extremely degenerate in mass . under this assumption neutralino",
    "becomes quasi - stable participating to the cold dark matter of the universe together with gravitino , and it is still around and it can be seen in direct detection searches experiments .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section we present the theoretical framework . in section 3",
    "we discuss all the relevant constraints from colliders and from cosmology , and we show our results .",
    "finally , we conclude .",
    "the particle physics model is defined by the superpotential @xmath1 as well as the soft breaking masses and couplings @xmath2 when the singlet acquires a vaccum expectation value , s , we obtain an effective @xmath3 parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "imposing universality at the gut scale , a small controllable number of free parameters remains , namely +    @xmath5    and the sign of the effective @xmath3 parameter can be chosen at will .",
    "because of the extra singlet superfield , in the nmssm there is a larger higgs sector and a larger neutralino sector .",
    "the neutralino mass matrix is characterized by the appearence of a fifth neutralino state , meaning that the composition of the lightest neutralino has an extra singlino contribution @xmath6 in the following , neutralinos with @xmath7 , or @xmath8 , will be referred to as bino- or singlino - like , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in the higgs sector we have now two cp - odd neutral , and three cp - even neutral higgses .",
    "we make the assumption that there is no cp - violation in the higgs sector , and therefore the cp - even and cp - odd states do not mix .",
    "we are not interested in the cp - odd states , while the cp - even higgs interaction and physical eigenstates are related by the transformation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unitary matrix that diagonalises the cp - even symmetric mass matrix , @xmath11 , and the physical eigenstates are ordered as @xmath12 .      in the usual case ( not in the degenerate scenario )",
    "gravitinos can be produced after inflation in two ways .",
    "one way to produce gravitinos is with scatterings from the thermal bath , and another is from the out - of - equillibrium decays of the nlsp , which decouple from the thermal bath before primordial big - bang nucleosynthesis and decay after the bbn time .",
    "thus , imposing the wmap bounds  @xcite we can write for the gravitino abundance @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 the mass of the nlsp , and @xmath16 the abundance the nlsp would have , had it not decayed into the gravitino . the thermal contribution is given by ( approximately for a light gravitino , @xmath17 )  @xcite @xmath18 in the limit where @xmath19 and @xmath20 the scenario looks as if one would have a two - component dark matter with the nlsp contribution @xmath21 , and a gravitino contribution from thermal production only , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , in the degenerate scenario with @xmath23 the wmap bound becomes @xmath24 where from now on the nlsp is the lightest neutralino , @xmath25 .",
    "- spectrum and collider constraints : we have used the computer software nmssmtools  @xcite , we have performed a random scan over the whole parameter space ( with fixed @xmath26 motivated by the muon anomalous magnetic moment ) , and we have selected only those points that satisfy all the theoretical requirements , as well as the lep bounds on the higgs mass , collider bounds on susy particle masses , and experimental data from b - physics  @xcite .",
    "for all these good points the lightest neutralino is either a bino or a singlino , and contrary to the case where neutralino is the dark matter particle , here we do not require that the neutralino relic density falls within the allowed wmap range .    -",
    "as we have already mentioned , the total dark matter abundance , and not the neutralino one , should satisfy the cold dark matter constraint  @xcite @xmath27 that relates the reheating temperature after inflation to the gravitino mass as follows @xmath28 for a given point in the cnmssm parameter space , the complete spectrum and couplings have been computed , and we are left with two more free parameters , namely the gravitino mass and the reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "the gravitino mass is equal essentially to the neutralino mass , and the precise value can be determined if we specify the neutralino lifetime . in the discussion to follow we have used a neutralino lifetime @xmath29 , although the results are not sensitive to it , and the figures we have produced for different values of the lifetime can not be distinguished . finally , the reheating temperature after inflation is obtained from the cold dark matter constraint .",
    "the thermal production contribution can not be larger than the total dark matter abundance , and for this we can already obtain an upper bound on the reheating temperature @xmath30 assuming a gluino mass @xmath31  tev , we can see that for a heavy gravitino , @xmath32  gev , it is possible to obtain a reheating temperature large enough for thermal leptogenesis .    - for neutralino nlsp in the degenerate scenario , the only decay mode is @xmath33 , for which the decay width can be computed once the supergravity largrangian is known  @xcite , and it is given by  @xcite @xmath34 ^ 3 \\left[1 + 3 \\frac{m_{{\\tilde{g}}}^2}{m_{\\chi}^2 } \\right ] \\label{neutralinogamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the planck mass , @xmath36 is the neutralino mass , and @xmath37 is the weak angle . in the limit where the mass difference @xmath38 is much lower than the masses themselves , @xmath39 ,",
    "the neutralino lifetime becomes @xmath40 from this formula one can see that for a mostly bino - neutralino a mass difference of 1 mev is already enough to give a neutralino lifetime larger than the age of the universe .",
    "- neutralino - nucleon spin - independent cross - section : lhc is now running and collecting data . although lhc is a powerful machine to look for physics beyond the standard model , it is known that other facilities are also needed to offer complementary information towards the direction of searching for supersymmetry and identifying dark matter .",
    "the gravitino interactions are suppressed by the planck mass , and therefore direct production of gravitinos at colliders and/or direct detection prospects seem to be hopeless . on the other hand , for a weakly interacting neutralino there are existing as well as future experiments that put experimental limits on the nucleon - neutralino cross - section .",
    "the spin - independent cross - section is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the nucleon - neutralino reduced mass , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in the above , @xmath45 , we have taken the following values for the hadronic matrix elements  @xcite : @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the coupling in the effective lagrangian @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes up- and down - type quarks , and the lagrangian is summed over the three quark generations .",
    "the coupling @xmath47 can be decomposed into two parts , @xmath50 , where the first term is the t - channel exchange of a neutral higgs ( fig .  1 ) , while the second term is the s - channel exchange of a squark ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the expressions for @xmath47 is terms of the masses and couplings of the model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "our main results are summarized in the figures below . in fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 we show the nucleon - neutralino spin - independent cross section ( in @xmath51 ) versus neutralino mass and lightest higgs boson ( in gev ) respectively .",
    "the blue region corresponds to a bino neutralino , while the green region corresponds to a singlino neutralino , and the curves are the current experimental limits from cdms  @xcite . according to our results",
    "the bino scenario is already ruled out , while in the singlino case the upper region can be probed by future experiments . in fig .",
    "5 we show the reheating temperature after inflation as a function of the neutralino / gravitino mass .",
    "the blue region corresponds to a bino , the blue points correspond to singlino , and finally the red points correspond to singlino with relatively high values of the cross - section , namely @xmath52 .",
    "the largest values of @xmath53 correspond to a bino , which is ruled out , and for the singlino with relatively high values of cross - section we obtain a reheating temperature @xmath54 for a neutralino / gravitino mass @xmath55 . in the last figure",
    "we show the ( @xmath56-@xmath57 ) plane ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 in gev ) for singlino points with a cross - section larger than @xmath58 , or lower than @xmath58 .",
    "we see that @xmath56 is not larger than 600 gev , and therefore future direct detection experiments can not probe a region of the parameter space which can neither be probed by lhc .",
    "in the framework of nmssm , which solves the mu problem , we have assumed that the gravitino lsp and the lightest neutralino nlsp are degenerate in mass . under this assumption",
    "the neutralino becomes extremely long - lived avoiding the bbn bounds . in this scenario",
    "we have a two component dark matter made out of the absolutely stable gravitino and the quasi - stable neutralino .",
    "we have performed a random scan over the whole parameter space keeping the points that satisfy the available collider constraints plus the wmap bound for dark matter .",
    "these points correspond to either a bino or a singlino neutralino .",
    "we have computed the neutralino - nucleon spin - independent cross section as a function of the neutralino mass and the lightest higgs mass , and we find that the bino is ruled out .",
    "then we explored the ( @xmath59 ) parameter space , and the reheating temperature dependence of the neutralino / gravitino mass for the singlino points that correspond to cross section values to be probed by future experiments .",
