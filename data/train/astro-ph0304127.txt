    "the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite is widely considered the leading candidate for producing jets and winds in star formation ( see reviews by @xcite ; @xcite ) ; alternative mechanisms involving thermal and/or radiation pressure have been shown to be inadequate .",
    "an outflow can in principle be launched by torsional alfvn waves , as shown numerically by @xcite and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these simulations are typically of relatively short duration , however , and it is not clear whether a large - scale , sustained outflow can be produced by this mechanism alone .",
    "the magnetocentrifugal model has two popular versions : x - winds @xcite and disk - winds @xcite .",
    "the x - winds are launched from a narrow region close to the truncation radius @xmath2 of the keplerian disk by a stellar magnetosphere .",
    "the disk - winds are , on the other hand , envisioned to come from a wider range of disk radii outside @xmath2 .",
    "these two possibilities are not immediately distinguishable observationally , because the launching surfaces in both cases are thought to be small , and only the flow regions at much larger distances are directly observable at the present .    in this letter , we derive a method of inferring the rotation rate ( and thus the radius ) of the wind - launching region on the keplerian disk from measurable quantities at large distances (  [ sec : method ] ) . in  [ sec : application ] , we first test the method on a set of numerically - determined large - scale magnetocentrifugal wind solutions , and then apply it to the well - studied wind of the t tauri star dg tau , using data obtained by @xcite with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the basic principle of magnetocentrifugal wind launching is well understood .",
    "it involves open field lines firmly anchored on a rapidly rotating disk , and centrifugal acceleration of fluid parcels along the field lines into a high - speed wind .",
    "the wind trails behind the disk in rotation , generating a toroidal component of magnetic field , which exerts a braking torque on the disk .",
    "it is this magnetic torque that is responsible for extracting both energy and angular momentum from the disk and for powering the wind .",
    "since the energy extracted is simply the work done by the rotating disk against the magnetic torque ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the rate of energy extraction is directly proportional to the rate of angular momentum extraction , with the proportionality constant being the angular speed @xmath3 of the disk rotation . the extracted energy and angular momentum are initially stored in an electromagnetic form .",
    "they are gradually converted into a kinetic form as the flow accelerates . at large observable distances ,",
    "the conversion is nearly complete , and the wind becomes kinetically dominated . along any given field line",
    ", the kinetic energy will then be proportional to the fluid angular momentum , with the same proportionality constant @xmath3 because of energy and angular momentum conservation .    at any observable location ( say of a distance @xmath4 from the rotation axis , where the subscript denotes a quantity far from the launching region ) , the specific kinetic energy and angular momentum of the wind",
    "are given by the poloidal and toroidal components of the fluid velocity , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , through @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "both velocity components can in principle be derived empirically from spatially resolved spectra and proper motion observations , as has been done for dg tau @xcite .",
    "once measured , they can be used to deduce the rate of disk rotation at the foot point of the field line passing through that location , through @xmath9 where @xmath10 is assumed , as is generally true at large distances .",
    "the above relation provides a simple way to infer the rotation rate of the wind - launching region on the keplerian disk and , if the central stellar mass is known independently , the distance from the star . in the next subsection , we will use the steady magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind theory to derive a refined version of this relation , taking into account of the energy and angular momentum associated with fluid rotation at the base of the wind .",
    "it is well known that in a steady , axisymmetric mhd wind , several quantities are conserved along a given field line @xcite .",
    "these include the total specific energy and angular momentum @xmath11 and the quantity @xmath12 , which can be interpreted as the angular speed at the base of the wind , @xmath3 , where the poloidal flow speed @xmath13 is negligible compared to the speed of keplerian rotation . here",
    ", @xmath14 denotes velocity , @xmath15 magnetic field , @xmath16 specific enthalpy , @xmath17 mass density , and @xmath18 the gravitational potential .",
    "the subscript @xmath19 refers to a quantity in the poloidal @xmath20 plane of a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath21 .",
    "we will ignore the enthalpy term in the expression for specific energy since magnetocentrifugal winds are dynamically cold in general .",
    "note from equation ( [ eqn : el ] ) that the magnetic contributions to the energy and angular momentum are proportional to each other . since neither of them can be measured directly , we get rid of both by constructing a combined quantity @xmath22 which is also conserved along a field line ( see also @xcite ) . at the launching surface , the wind corotates with the disk at the local keplerian speed @xmath23 , which yields @xmath24 . as the distance increases , the gravitational potential @xmath18 decreases quickly , and we have approximately @xmath25 since the keplerian speed of disk rotation is related to the angular speed through @xmath26 around a star of mass @xmath27 , we finally have @xmath28 which is the desired equation for determining the disk rotation rate @xmath3 in the wind - launching region from measurable quantities at large distances .",
    "mathematically , we can define @xmath29 , and cast equation ( [ eqn : final2 ] ) into a cubic equation @xmath30 with the coefficients @xmath31 if we let @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , then the nature of the solution is determined by the value of @xmath35 . for @xmath36 , which is always true in our case , there are one real and two complex conjugate roots .",
    "the real root is given analytically by @xmath37 once @xmath38 is determined , one can obtain the angular speed through @xmath39 , and infer the wind - launching radius through @xmath40 .",
    "astrophysically interesting magnetocentrifugal winds are probably `` fast '' in the sense that they have enough energy to climb out the potential well of the central star easily ( instead of barely ) . in such a case",
    ", we expect the kinetic energy of the wind ( the third term of eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : final2 ] ] ) to be substantially greater than the gravitational binding energy at the launching surface ( which is essentially the second term of eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : final2 ] ] ) . noting again that typically @xmath41 , we recover from equation ( [ eqn : final2 ] ) the simple relation ( [ eqn : relation1 ] ) , which can be cast into a more practical form @xmath42 for locating the wind - launching region on the disk .",
    "we have tested the method of inferring the rotation rate of the wind - launching surface on a set of numerically - determined magnetocentrifugal wind solutions ( j.  anderson et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "these solutions are obtained using the mhd code @xcite assuming axisymmetry .",
    "the simulation setup and code modifications are described in @xcite .",
    "basically , we prescribe on the keplerian disk around a solar - mass star a distribution of open magnetic field , and load onto the field a mass flux at a low speed ( typically @xmath43 of keplerian ) .",
    "the slowly - moving wind material is accelerated centrifugally along the rotating field lines into a high - speed flow .",
    "the wind gradually sweeps the ambient medium out of the simulation box , chosen to have a @xmath44 size , and settles into a steady state .",
    "the properties of the steady wind at large distances are determined uniquely by the conditions on the launching surface .",
    "they are used for our method verification .",
    "the results of applying our method to two representative simulations are presented in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "the simulations differ only in the mass loading rate of the wind ; model l corresponds to a `` light '' wind , with @xmath45 , typical of t tauri winds , and model h corresponds to a `` heavy '' wind , with @xmath46 , which is more extreme @xcite . for each model , we first read out from the solution the two velocity components @xmath5 and @xmath6 at four selected , observable locations with known cylindrical radius @xmath4 , and then compute the corresponding angular speed at the launching surface from both the simple relation ( [ eqn : relation1 ] ) , @xmath47 , and the refined relation ( [ eqn : final2 ] ) , @xmath48 . comparing the predicted values with the exact @xmath3 , we find that the simple relation ( [ eqn : relation1 ] ) works well for the light wind , but under predicts the rotation rate by a factor of two for the more extreme , heavy wind .",
    "the large discrepancy in the latter case comes from the neglect of the fluid energy and angular momentum at the base of the wind in deriving relation ( [ eqn : relation1 ] ) , which are comparable to their magnetic counterparts for the heavy wind .",
    "the fluid contributions are included in relation ( [ eqn : final2 ] ) , which yields a rotation rate accurate to within about @xmath49 in both cases .",
    "the small errors can be further reduced if the ( slow ) speed with which the wind solution is initiated and the gravitational binding energy at the observing location are accounted for properly , which can be done .",
    "such refinements are not warranted , however , given the large uncertainties in real observational data , to which we now turn .",
    "observational data needed to locate the wind - launching region on the disk are available for dg tau , thanks to the spatially resolved spectra of several forbidden lines obtained by @xcite using hst / stis .",
    "the stis slit was placed along the axis of the flow and at three pairs of locations at distances @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 from the axis ( one on each side ) .",
    "two distinct velocity components are detected , with the high - velocity component ( hvc ) concentrating near the axis and the low - velocity component ( lvc ) being more laterally extended .",
    "@xcite analyzed the extended lvc in detail , and derived the radial ( line - of - sight ) velocity @xmath53 at four positions along each slit , labeled i through iv in their fig .",
    "they also found tentative evidence for rotation from the difference in radial velocity between the regions displaced symmetrically with respect to the axis .",
    "the axis is inclined at @xmath54 to our line of sight @xcite , which allows us to estimate the poloidal speed @xmath55 , assuming a flow predominantly parallel to the axis .",
    "this assumption is expected to break down badly in region i , which is the closest to the disk ; it should be accurate to @xmath56 or better in the other regions .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath5 in regions ii through iv are listed in table  [ tab : dgtau ] , along with the deprojected toroidal velocities computed using the numbers given in table  1 of @xcite , which are uncertain .",
    "the angular speed @xmath57 in table  [ tab : dgtau ] is derived from equation ( [ eqn : final2 ] ) , and the wind - launching radius @xmath58 is computed for a stellar mass @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "it is clear from table  [ tab : dgtau ] that the lvc of the dg tau wind comes from a range in disk radius , from @xmath0 to @xmath60 .",
    "the spread in launching radius can be understood qualitatively as follows : in each of the three regions , the flow located closest to the axis ( at the @xmath61 distance ) has the highest poloidal speed ( and thus the highest specific energy ) and the lowest , or close to the lowest , toroidal speed ( and thus the lowest specific angular momentum given its small distance ) . to extract the highest energy against the weakest torque on the disk ( corresponding to the lowest angular momentum )",
    ", the field line passing through the innermost location in each region must be driven at the fastest rate at the foot point , i.e. , must be anchored closest to the central star .",
    "detailed calculations confirm this expectation , as shown in fig .",
    "fig : dgtau , where straight lines connecting the observing locations and their originating points on the disk are plotted .",
    "these lines give a crude indication of the actual streamlines .",
    "they are well behaved , with two exceptions : the lines associated with the two outer locations in region iv cross other lines , which is problematic .",
    "however , region iv appears to be perturbed by a limb - brightened bubble - like structure @xcite , which may have introduced additional asymmetry to the flow with respect to the axis , and compromised the estimates of toroidal speed and thus the foot point locations .",
    "we reiterate that our values of @xmath5 are estimated from the radial velocities at the peak of forbidden lines , which sample only the component of poloidal velocity parallel to the axis , @xmath62 , in the likely case of peak emission originating from the tangent point of our line of sight with the wind .",
    "since the @xmath63 component is unmeasured , our values of @xmath5 are actually underestimates .",
    "this effect will be most pronounced for the least collimated part of the flow , where @xmath5 can be underestimated by as much as @xmath56 .",
    "taking this effect into account could move the outermost launching point inward by a factor up to two .    with",
    "the rotation rate @xmath3 determined , we can estimate the alfvn radius @xmath64 by equating the fluid angular momentum at large distances , @xmath65 , with the total angular momentum , @xmath66 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the estimates for @xmath64 are listed in table  [ tab : dgtau ] and the corresponding `` alfvn points '' are plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "fig : dgtau .",
    "the alfvn radius turns out to be @xmath67 to @xmath68 times the foot point radius ( except for the `` streamline '' passing through the bubble - affected outermost location in region iv ; see table  [ tab : dgtau ] ) .",
    "the typical ratio of @xmath69 implies that roughly @xmath70 of the material accreted through the disk is ejected in the extended lvc of the dg tau wind as per the relationship @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we have developed a method of locating the launching region of t tauri winds , if such winds are driven magnetocentrifugally , as is widely believed .",
    "our method relies on the fact that the energy and angular momentum in the wind are extracted mostly by magnetic fields from the rotating disk , and they are related by the rate of disk rotation because the energy extracted is the work done by the rotating disk against the magnetic torque responsible for the angular momentum extraction . since most of the wind energy and angular momentum at large , observable distances are in the measurable kinetic form",
    ", they can be used to infer the disk rotation rate in the wind launching region . applying this method to the wind of dg tau",
    ", we find that its spatially resolved lvc comes from a region on the disk extending from @xmath0 and @xmath60 from the central star .",
    "this range brackets the rough estimate of @xmath72 by @xcite .",
    "it strengthens the notion that the lvcs of t tauri winds are driven from relatively large disk radii @xcite .",
    "the dg tau wind has a hvc with a radial velocity of @xmath73 @xcite . where this component is launched is less certain .",
    "it is unresolved in the transverse direction in the hst observations @xcite , implying a half - width @xmath74 . unless rotating at a speed much greater than that inferred for the lvc ( @xmath75 ) , the hvc must be driven magnetocentrifugally from a disk region with radius on the order of @xmath76 or smaller , according to equation  ( [ eqn : final4 ] ) .",
    "the small launching radius is indicative of an x - wind origin @xcite . to draw a more quantitative conclusion on the launching radius of the hvc , its rotational speed must be measured , which may become possible with the advent of optical interferometry using large , ground - based telescopes .",
