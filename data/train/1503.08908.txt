    "the standard model ( sm ) fails to provide an explanation for the baryon - to - photon ratio in the present universe , @xmath2  @xcite , which serves as a major indication for new physics .",
    "consequently , some new dynamical mechanism must be responsible for baryogenesis , i.e. , the generation of a primordial baryon - antibaryon asymmetry in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "most mechanisms proposed in the literature are devised so as to satisfy the three famous sakharov conditions  @xcite : ( i ) violation of baryon number @xmath3 ( or lepton number @xmath4 in the case of leptogenesis ) , ( ii ) violation of @xmath5 as well as of @xmath0 invariance , and ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium . as it turns out , it is , however , not mandatory to fulfill these three conditions in order to successfully generate a baryon asymmetry .",
    "the point is that sakharov s conditions are based on the assumption of @xmath6 invariance , which means that one is actually able to circumvent them in case @xmath6 is spontaneously broken .",
    "this idea has been pioneered by cohen and kaplan in their scenario of _ spontaneous baryogenesis _",
    "@xcite , where the baryon asymmetry is generated in thermal equilibrium ; and since then , it has been studied and expanded upon by many authors  @xcite . for example , kusenko et al .",
    "have recently shown how the @xmath6 violation during the phase of sm higgs relaxation after the end of inflation can be used for the realization of baryogenesis via leptogenesis  @xcite . in this talk ,",
    "i will draw upon this earlier work and demonstrate that it can be easily generalized to the case of generic axion - like scalar fields relaxing from large initial field values in the course of reheating ; further details pertaining to our analysis can be found in our recent paper  @xcite as well as in another forthcoming publication .    in an expanding universe at nonzero temperature ,",
    "@xmath6 invariance can be easily broken spontaneously by introducing a pseudoscalar field , @xmath7 , which couples derivatively to the fermion current @xmath8 in the lagrangian , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being some cut - off scale . imposing spatial homogeneity , @xmath11 , and assuming that the classical background is given cause to evolve with nonzero velocity , @xmath12 , ( which is readily done in the early universe , as we will review shortly ) this coupling turns into an effective chemical potential @xmath13 for the fermion number , @xmath14 which shifts the energy levels of fermions @xmath15 and antifermions @xmath16 w.r.t .  each other . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the minimum of the free energy is therefore obtained for a nonzero fermion - antifermion asymmetry @xmath17 , @xmath18 as observed by cohen and kaplan , this result may serve as a basis for the successful generation of the baryon asymmetry . however , in order to arrive at a realistic model , one first of all has to address three important questions : ( i ) what is the nature of the field @xmath19 and the origin of the derivative coupling in eq .",
    ", ( ii ) how is the field @xmath19 set in motion , and ( iii ) what kind of interactions drive the number density @xmath17 towards its equilibrium value @xmath20 ? in the following , i shall discuss each of these issues in turn , cf .",

    "[ fig : interplay],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us integrate the derivative interaction in eq .   by parts , @xmath23 .",
    "this illustrates that the @xmath6-violating coupling required for baryogenesis is equivalent to a coupling of the pseudoscalar @xmath19 to the divergence of the fermion current @xmath8 .",
    "the field @xmath19 is thus naturally identified as an axion - like field , or simply `` axion ''  @xcite , which couples to the anomaly of the fermion number @xmath24 . from this point of view ,",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath10 in eq .",
    "is immediately recognized as the decay constant of the axion field @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , we note that the electroweak anomalies of the baryon number @xmath25 and lepton number @xmath26 in the sm allow us to recast the axion coupling to @xmath27 as a coupling to the electroweak field strength tensors @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of sm fermion generations and with @xmath32 and @xmath33 denoting the electroweak gauge couplings . interactions of this form may , for instance , arise in string theory , which always features at least one ( model - independent ) axion  @xcite associated with the green - schwarz mechanism of anomaly cancellation  @xcite .",
    "this axion couples to all gauge groups with universal strength @xmath34  @xcite . besides that",
    ", string theory may also give rise to a multitude of further axions fields coupling to different gauge groups with nonuniversal strength  @xcite .",
    "the couplings of these model - dependent axions are then determined by the gauge structure as well as the details of the compactification . for our purposes ,",
    "the upshot of these considerations is that a certain linear combination of stringy axions may very well end up coupling to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . in the following",
    ", we shall therefore identify the field @xmath19 in eq .   with just this linear combination and",
    "take the above string - based argument to be the origin of the coupling @xmath37 in the lagrangian .",
    "the dynamics of the axion background in the early universe are governed by its classical equation of motion , @xmath38 where the effective potential @xmath39 and hence the axion mass @xmath40 may , for instance , originate from instanton effects in a strongly coupled hidden sector featuring a dynamical scale @xmath41 .",
    "assuming that the pq - like symmetry associated with the flat axion direction is broken sufficiently early before the end of inflation ( and not restored afterwards ) , the initial axion field value @xmath42 becomes constant on superhorizon scales .",
    "for definiteness , we shall therefore take @xmath43 to be @xmath44 in the entire observable universe at the end of inflation . as we will see",
    "shortly , the baryon asymmetry produced during reheating is going to depend on @xmath45 .",
    "because of that , we have to ensure that the baryonic isocurvature perturbations induced by the quantum fluctuations @xmath46 of the axion field around its homogeneous background @xmath45 remain below the observational bound  @xcite .",
    "this constrains the hubble rate @xmath47 during inflation : @xmath48 or equivalently @xmath49 . at the same time",
    ", we have to require that @xmath50 , so that during inflation the hubble friction term on the left - hand side of eq .   outweighs the potential gradient on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "after the end of inflation , the hubble rate then begins to drop , until , around @xmath51 , the axion begins to coherently oscillate around the minimum of its effective potential , @xmath52 , with frequency @xmath53 . during this stage of _ axion relaxation _ , the axion field therefore evolves with nonzero velocity in its potential , which temporarily induces an effective chemical potential for the fermion number , as anticipated at the beginning of this talk , cf .",

    "[ fig : scan],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to make use of @xmath60 for the purposes of baryogenesis , it is important that there be an _ external source _ of baryon or lepton number violation that proceeds at a much faster rate @xmath61 than the motion of the axion field in its effective potential , @xmath62 .",
    "only then do the axion oscillations act as an adiabatic background , so that @xmath63 can be interpreted as an effective chemical potential  @xcite . here ,",
    "a minimal choice to satisfy this requirement is to rely on @xmath4 violation through the @xmath64- and @xmath65-channel exchange of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath66 , @xmath67 these processes are guaranteed to be present in the bath as long as one believes in the seesaw mechanism as the correct explanation for the small neutrino masses in the sm  @xcite . in order to separate the leptogenesis mechanism under study form the contributions from ordinary thermal leptogenesis",
    ", we shall assume that all right - handed neutrinos @xmath66 acquire majorana masses @xmath68 close to the scale of grand unification ( gut ) , @xmath69 , so that none of them is actually ever thermally produced .",
    "for center - of - mass energies @xmath70 , the thermally averaged cross section of the @xmath71 lepton - higgs scattering processes in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath72 , is then practically fixed  @xcite by the experimental data on the sm neutrino sector  @xcite , @xmath73 correspondingly , the evolution of the @xmath4 number density @xmath74 is described by the following boltzmann equation , @xmath75 where we have approximated the lepton and @xmath4 number densities in thermal equilibrium , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , by their corresponding expressions in the classical boltzmann approximation .",
    "notice that the production term on the right - hand side of this equation , @xmath78 , is largely independent of the details of the neutrino sector .",
    "it does , in particular , not depend on the amount of @xmath0 violation in the neutrino sector nor on the heavy neutrino mass spectrum . at the same time , it increases linearly with the light neutrino mass scale @xmath79 .",
    "the usual bound on this mass scale from thermal leptogenesis , @xmath80 , ( where it ensures that dangerous washout processes do not become too strong  @xcite ) hence does not apply in our scenario .",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale will soon be probed experimentally ( on earth  @xcite as well as in the sky  @xcite ) .",
    "this , therefore , entails the intriguing possibility to test our model against the conventional scenario of thermal leptogenesis in the near future .",
    "subsequent to its generation ( according to eq .  ) , the lepton asymmetry is partly converted into a baryon asymmetry by means of electroweak sphalerons . the final present - day baryon asymmetry @xmath81 is then given as @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the sm sphaleron conversion factor as well as the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at high and low temperatures , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath86 represents the final lepton asymmetry after the late - time decay of the axion field at times around @xmath87 , where @xmath88 . in general",
    ", @xmath86 does not correspond to the equilibrium number density at the same time , @xmath89 , as the efficiency of leptogenesis typically begins to cease before the equilibrium value is actually reached , so that @xmath90 .    for fixed values of @xmath45 and @xmath10 , the final lepton asymmetry ends up depending on two parameters : the axion mass @xmath57 as well as the reheating temperature @xmath91 , which is , in turn , determined by the inflaton decay rate , @xmath92 .",
    "we infer the precise parameter dependence of @xmath86 by numerically solving eqs .   and together with the friedmann equation for the scale factor as well as the boltzmann equations for the number densities of inflaton particles and relativistic sm particles , respectively .",
    "as it turns out , our exact numerical result can be very well reproduced by the following analytical expression , cf .",
    "also the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] , @xmath93 with @xmath5 being a numerical fudge factor of @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 denotes the all - time maximum of the lepton asymmetry , which is reached around the time when the axion oscillations set it , i.e. , at @xmath96 .",
    "note that it is rather insensitive to both @xmath45 and @xmath10 , as it only depends on the ratio @xmath97 , which is expected to be of @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath98 and @xmath99 account for the dilution of @xmath95 in the course of inflaton and axion decays , respectively , @xmath100 here , @xmath98 reflects the interplay between leptogenesis and reheating , cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : interplay ] . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the axion begins to oscillate before the end of reheating and the initial asymmetry becomes diluted due to the entropy production in inflaton decays . for @xmath102 , on the other hand , the axion oscillations only set in after the end of reheating and the final asymmetry becomes independent of the inflaton decay rate .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath99 begins to play a role for @xmath10 values around @xmath103 , cf .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] . for smaller values of @xmath10",
    ", we always have @xmath104 in the entire parameter region of interest .",
    "the factor @xmath105 , finally , accounts for the efficiency of the washout term , @xmath106 , on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "for @xmath101 , @xmath107 can be roughly estimated as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the typical temperature scale of leptogenesis , while , for @xmath102 , we have @xmath110 . a better analytical understanding of washout in our scenario is , however , still pending .",
    "successful leptogenesis restricts the axion decay constant @xmath10 to take a value within the following range , @xmath111 which translates into allowed ranges for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath91 , cf .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] , which are all very well consistent with typical string axion models .",
    "we note that , for smaller values of @xmath10 , it is not possible to generate a sufficiently large baryon asymmetry , while keeping the baryonic isocurvature perturbations small enough .",
    "likewise , for larger values of @xmath10 , the dilution of the asymmetry in the late - time decay of the axion is too strong .",
    "while thermal leptogenesis typically operates at @xmath112 , the requirement of a large rate of @xmath4 violation , @xmath113 , pushes @xmath91 to values at least of @xmath114 in our scenario .",
    "furthermore , our final baryon asymmetry turns out be independent of the amount of @xmath0 violation in the neutrino sector as well as of the @xmath66 mass spectrum . on top of that , the usual bound on @xmath79 from thermal leptogenesis does not apply in our case .",
    "the presented model should therefore be regarded as an attractive alternative to thermal leptogenesis in case the latter should begin to look less favorable from the experimental point of view ! beyond that , further work is needed : it remains , for instance , to be seen how the required high @xmath91 could be possibly accommodated in a supersymmetric version of our model .",
    "a further intriguing question , which we are currently investigating , is whether the role of the axion field @xmath19 could not be equally played by the inflaton .",
    "this would result in an even more minimal scenario .",
