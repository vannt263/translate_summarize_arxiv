    "polarization plays a crucial role in physics of electroweak interactions . starting from the fifties",
    "when parity violation was discovered up to present days of the lep @xcite and slc @xcite experiments , polarized fermions in initial and final states have been instrumental in uncovering properties of fundamental particles and their interactions . quite often due to a large degree of polarization",
    ", high accuracy can be achieved even for a relatively low number of events .",
    "a recent spectacular example is the precise measurement of the electroweak mixing parameter @xmath4 at slc @xcite .",
    "nowadays many processes involving polarized leptons are successfully employed at experimental facilities .",
    "the situation is quite opposite for the strongly interacting fundamental fermions . due to confinement",
    "the quarks remain bound inside hadrons which are strongly interacting composite systems .",
    "thus in general the physical quantities depend on the polarizations of quarks in intricate manner .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that nature provides us with a few processes which can be considered as sources of highly polarized top , bottom , and charm quarks .",
    "moreover , in these reactions the polarizations of the heavy quarks are not much affected by strong interactions .",
    "some physicists believe that the third generation of quarks is the best available window on new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that future experimental studies with polarized heavy quarks will lead to significant progress in particle physics .    in the present article",
    "some reactions are discussed which involve polarized heavy quarks . in sect.2 sources of polarized top quarks are discussed . in sect.3 top quark pair production in @xmath0 annihilation is considered near production threshold .",
    "it is shown that the green function method @xcite can be extended to the case of polarized @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "some results of our recent studies @xcite are presented .",
    "in particular it has been demonstrated that for the longitudinally polarized electron beam an optimally polarized sample of top quarks can be produced . in sect.4",
    "semileptonic decays of heavy quarks are discussed including recent results on qcd corrections to these processes .",
    "we argue that the cleanest spin analysis for the top quarks can be obtained from their semileptonic decay channels . in sect.5 polarization phenomena for @xmath2 and @xmath7",
    "quarks produced at the @xmath3 peak are briefly reviewed .",
    "as the heaviest fermion of the standard model the top quark is an exciting new window on very high mass scale physics . there is no doubt that precise studies of top quark production and decays will provide us with new information about the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the analysis of polarized top quarks and their decays has recently attracted considerable attention ; see @xcite and references cited therein . for non - relativistic top",
    "quarks the polarization studies are free from hadronization ambiguities .",
    "this is due to the short lifetime of the top quark which is shorter than the formation time of top mesons and toponium resonances .",
    "therefore top decays intercept the process of hadronization at an early stage and practically eliminate associated non - perturbative effects .",
    "many processes have been proposed which can lead to the production of polarized top quarks . in hadronic collisions and for unpolarized beams",
    "the polarization studies are mainly based on the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay products .",
    "however , single top production through @xmath8 fusion at lhc may also be a source of polarized top quarks .",
    "an interesting reaction is top quark pair production in @xmath9 annihilation at a linear photon collider . at such a machine",
    "the high energy photon beams can be generated via compton scattering of laser light on electrons accelerated in the linac .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the reaction @xmath10 has been reviewed in @xcite and the top quark polarization in this reaction has been recently considered in @xcite . a linear photon collider is a very interesting project .",
    "if built it may prove to be one of the most useful facilities exploring the high energy frontier .",
    "however , at present it is not clear whether the energy resolution of this accelerator can be considerably improved . as it stands the energy resolution limits precision of the top quark threshold studies at photon colliders .",
    "the most efficient and flexible reaction producing polarized top quarks is pair production in @xmath0 annihilation with longitudinally polarized electron beams . for @xmath11 in the threshold region one can study decays of polarized top quarks under particularly convenient conditions : large event rates , well - identified rest frame of the top quark , and large degree of polarization . at the same time , thanks to the spectacular success of the polarization program at slc @xcite , the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam will be an obvious option for a future linear collider .",
    "the top quark is a short  lived particle . for the top mass @xmath12 in the range 160190 gev its width @xmath13 increases with @xmath12 from 1 to 2 gev .",
    "thus @xmath13 by far exceeds the tiny ( @xmath14 1 mev ) hyperfine splitting for toponia and open top hadrons , the hadronization scale of about 200 mev , and even the energy splitting between @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 resonances .",
    "on one side this is an advantage because long - distance phenomena related to confinement are less important for top quarks @xcite .",
    "in particular depolarization due to hadronization is practically absent . on the other side",
    "the amount of information available from the threshold region is significantly reduced .",
    "toponium resonances including the @xmath15 state overlap each other . as a consequence",
    "the cross section for @xmath17 pair production near energy threshold has a rather simple and smooth shape .",
    "= 5.5 in -0.2 cm    the quantitative theoretical study of the threshold region is a complicated problem .",
    "the excitation curve @xmath18 depends on @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in addition it is drastically affected by strong interactions . a few gev below and above the nominal threshold @xmath19 a multitude of overlapping @xmath20 wave resonances is excited .",
    "one might think that a reasonably accurate description can be obtained by performing a sum over these resonances .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that one has to include so many resonances that such an approach is practically useless .",
    "perturbative approach is also non - trivial in the threshold region . in seminal papers @xcite",
    "fadin and khoze have demonstrated that for non - relativistic @xmath5 and @xmath6 the dominant contribution to the amplitude is given by the sum of the ladder diagrams depicted in fig.[fig - ladder ] .",
    "the dashed lines denote the instantaneous parts of the gluon propagators which in the coulomb gauge read @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the three - momentum transfer and @xmath23 is the chromostatic potential in the momentum space .",
    "we have also neglected contributions of space - space components @xmath24 which are suppressed by factors of order @xmath25 .",
    "the diagram with @xmath26 exchanges gives the contribution of order @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath29 denotes the velocity of the top quark in the center - of - mass frame . in the threshold region @xmath30 and all the contributions are of the same order .",
    "in @xcite it has been also shown that the sum of the terms in fig.[fig - ladder ] can be expressed through the green function of the @xmath1 system .",
    "the effects of the top quark width have been incorporated through the complex energy @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the non - relativistic energy of the system .",
    "finally , fadin and khoze @xcite have calculated analytically the green function for the coulomb chromostatic interaction between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they have pointed out that the excitation curve @xmath18 allows a precise determination of @xmath12 as well as of other quantities such as @xmath13 and @xmath28 .",
    "strassler and peskin @xcite have obtained similar results using a numerical approach and a more realistic qcd potential .",
    "the idea @xcite to use the green function instead of summing over overlapping resonances has been also applied in numerical calculations of differential cross sections .",
    "independent approaches have been developed for solving schrdinger equation in position space @xcite and lippmann - schwinger equation in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the results of these two methods agree very well @xcite .",
    "one of the most important future applications will be the determination of @xmath12 and @xmath28 .",
    "more detailed discussions can be found in the original papers and in the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "it has been already mentioned that the hyperfine splitting for @xmath1 system is much smaller than its lifetime .",
    "this implies that the polarizations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are only weakly affected by qcd interactions between these quarks .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to consider the production of @xmath5 quark ( and @xmath6 antiquark ) of given polarization .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we confine our discussion to the case of top quark polarization .",
    "two - particle spin correlations for the @xmath1 system will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . in close analogy to the unpolarized case , c.f .",
    "fig.[fig - ladder ] , we consider @xmath0 annihilation into @xmath17 pair . the four - momentum of the top quark is denoted by @xmath33 and its spin four - vector by @xmath34 .",
    "the antiquark @xmath6 carries the four - momentum @xmath35 .",
    "the electron and the positron are relativistic and their masses can be neglected .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the four - momenta of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 the matrix element squared for @xmath11 can be written as a contraction of the leptonic and hadronic tensors @xmath41 it is evident from fig.[fig - ladder ] that the leptonic tensor @xmath42 is well described by the born expression whereas the hadronic tensor @xmath43 is given by a complicated sum of ladder diagrams .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the component of the total angular momentum in the direction of @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 whereas for for @xmath47 @xmath48 the subscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the contributions of the vector and axial - vector leptonic currents , and @xmath51 it follows from eq.([eq - lepton ] ) that for longitudinally polarized electrons and positrons the total annihilation cross section is proportional to @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the polarizations of @xmath55 and @xmath45 , with respect to the directions of @xmath55 and @xmath45 beams , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the polarization of the top quark depends only on the variable @xmath56 it is conceivable that for a future linear @xmath0 collider @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "another interesting observation is that only the space - like components @xmath60 of the hadronic tensor can contribute to the differential cross section .",
    "( in fact only the transverse components @xmath61 give non - zero contributions . )",
    "thus in the following discussion we consider only the components @xmath60 of the hadronic tensor .",
    "= 5.5 in    = 5.5 in -0.2 cm    in the center - of - mass frame the velocity of the top quark is small ( @xmath62 ) and we can use the non - relativistic approximation for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the spin four - vector is @xmath63 thus , up to terms of order @xmath25 the spin three - vector @xmath64 is the same as in the top quark rest frame .",
    "we define effective vertices @xmath65 and @xmath66 describing the couplings of the vector ( @xmath50 ) and the axial - vector currents ( @xmath49 ) to the top quark of four - momentum @xmath33 and spin four - vector @xmath34 and the antiquark @xmath6 of four - momentum @xmath67 , see fig.[fig - vert ] .",

    "recent measurements by cdf collaboration@xcite imply @xmath86  gev and the analysis of @xmath87 collaboration@xcite gives @xmath88  gev .",
    "it has been shown that the corrections due to momentum dependent width cancel to large extent and are quite small for @xmath89  gev @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath90 it can be shown that the function @xmath91 is the @xmath20 wave green function @xcite .",
    "it solves the following lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath92 which follows trivially from eq.([eq - ls0 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath93 is related to the @xmath94 wave green function @xcite .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath95 follows from eq.([eq - ls1 ] ) : @xmath96    a remarkable feature of the odd parts of the effective vertices @xmath97 and",
    "@xmath98 is that in non - relativistic approximation their spinor structures are not changed by chromostatic interactions , see eqs.([eq - gamv ] ) and ( [ eq - gama ] ) .",
    "when these interactions are switched off ( i.e. @xmath99 ) the sums of the ladder diagrams which define the effective vertices reduce to single diagrams with no gluon exchanges , the vertex functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 become equal one , and the spinor structures remain the same .",
    "this means that from a practical point of view the calculations of the matrix element squared ( [ eq - m2 ] ) including chromostatic interactions between @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be reduced to the evaluation of born contributions .",
    "the only difference is that the vector and axial - vector couplings @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the quark current to photon and @xmath3 are modified : @xmath102",
    "the prescription given in eqs.([eq - gv ] ) and ( [ eq - ga ] ) includes not only chromostatic interactions but also two other important effects : the scale dependence of the running coupling constants @xmath103 and the factors @xmath104 and @xmath105 which arise from loop integrations over the relativistic region ( contributions of hard transverse gluons ) ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are ready now to describe the process which consists of the emission of a @xmath1 system by a virtual photon or @xmath3 and its subsequent propagation and decay into @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 ) .",
    "this is just the most difficult part of the calculation for which perturbative ( in @xmath28 ) approach is not adequate . after the decay",
    "the time evolution of the system is governed by the free motion of @xmath108 and chromodynamical interactions in the @xmath109 system .",
    "( if @xmath6 decays first one considers the analogous time evolution for @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) . in this period one of the strongly interacting fermions",
    "is relativistic .",
    "in contrast to the case of the @xmath1 system the summation over ladder diagrams is not necessary because a diagram with @xmath26 exchanged gluons is suppressed by @xmath112 . in other words",
    "this part of the time evolution can be described in ordinary perturbative approach .",
    "finally the @xmath113 system decays into @xmath114 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath115 describing the two decay sequences in @xmath1 rest frame @xmath116 have to be added coherently . the theoretical description becomes even more complicated when @xmath117 bosons are treated as unstable particles .",
    "in such a case we have six different decay sequences .",
    "furthermore one or two of @xmath117 bosons can decay into quarks whose interactions with @xmath2 and/or @xmath118 can be also important in some regions of phase space .",
    "these are the so - called _ cross talking _ or _ interconnection _ effects@xcite . even more important",
    "are effects of gluon radiation off @xmath119 and @xmath111 systems@xcite .",
    "all these phenomena have to be included into a complete theoretical analysis of @xmath17 production near threshold .",
    "however , it is likely that these refinements will not drastically change the results for inclusive cross sections which we consider in the following .",
    "in fact , we assume that the contributions of the interference terms cancel",
    ". this assumption can be easily justified when qcd interactions in @xmath120 and @xmath121 systems are neglected .",
    "let @xmath122 denote the energy of @xmath5 which for non - interacting system is equal to the total energy @xmath123 .",
    "overall energy conservation implies that the energy of @xmath124 system ( i.e. of @xmath6 ) is equal to @xmath125 .",

    "thus this term corresponds to the situation when @xmath5 decays before @xmath6 .",
    "the other term corresponds to the case when @xmath6 decays before @xmath5 . neglecting some common factors we obtain the following expressions for the amplitudes @xmath128 and @xmath129 : @xmath130 and , consequently ,",

    "it is known @xcite that interference affects the gluon spectrum in @xmath17 pair production for @xmath135 .",
    "however , @xmath136 is infrared finite , so the relative correction to the width due to these effects should be only of order @xmath137 and can be neglected . ] @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 the resulting reduction of the width of about depends on the choice of the scale @xmath141 for running @xmath142 .",
    "a widespread belief is that @xmath143 is a reasonable value .",
    "however , arguments in favour of a much lower scale @xmath144 have been also given in the literature@xcite . ]",
    "10% changes significantly the time evolution of the @xmath17 system and affects the results for the total cross section in the threshold region .",
    "the rescattering corrections change the wave function @xmath145 of @xmath132 ( or @xmath133 ) to @xmath146 where up to corrections of order @xmath147 the functions @xmath148 and @xmath145 are orthogonal @xmath149 as a consequence of unitary time evolution .",
    "thus there is no @xmath150 contribution to the total cross section from the rescattering corrections .",
    "this fact , which was first observed long ago for the electromagnetic corrections to the lifetime of the muon bound in nuclei  @xcite , has been recently demonstrated by explicit calculations also for the top quark pair production  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the differential distributions ( @xmath151 ) have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the results fully confirm intuitive expectations that rescattering in @xmath152 system leads to reduction of intrinsic momentum of @xmath6 in the overall center - of - mass frame . in this frame",
    "the @xmath2 quark is slowed down by the chromostatic field of @xmath6 . since @xmath108 is colorless it propagates as a free particle . in consequence the total three - momentum of the @xmath153 system decreases , which through momentum conservation implies reduction of the intrinsic momentum for @xmath6 . in the following discussion",
    "we neglect this correction to the top quark momentum distributions because it only weakly affects polarizations .    throughout this article",
    "all corrections of order @xmath25 are systematically neglected",
    ". however , close to threshold the dependence of cross sections on the width is enhanced , so a few remarks on order @xmath154 corrections to the width of the @xmath1 system are in order here .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that effects of phase space suppression are important and can not be neglected in quantitative studies . as an example of the phase space suppression effects let us consider @xmath17 for negative non - relativistic energy @xmath155 and assume that @xmath5 decays first .",
    "the propagator function @xmath156 is peaked for the energy of @xmath6 close to the classical value .",
    "taking into account the kinetic energies which according to virial theorem are of order @xmath157 one concludes that the invariant mass of the @xmath158 system is likely to be a few percent smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "this implies an even larger reduction of the decay rate .",
    "however , it has been conjectured@xcite and proven@xcite that order @xmath154 rescattering corrections to the total cross section nearly cancel the negative contributions of phase space suppression .",
    "the remainder can be interpreted as due to time dilatation factors for @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "its effect on the total cross section is quite small and will be neglected in the following discussion .",
    "this implies that the volumes of the phase spaces for the @xmath158 and @xmath124 systems can be considered equal and proportional to @xmath13 . in this way",

    "polarization studies for heavy flavors at lep@xcite and slc@xcite are a new and interesting field of potentially fundamental significance . according to the standard model @xmath256 and @xmath257",
    "decays can be viewed as sources of highly polarized heavy quarks .",
    "the degree of longitudinal polarization is fairly large , amounting to @xmath258 for @xmath2 and @xmath259 for @xmath7 quarks  @xcite .",
    "the polarizations depend weakly on the production angle .",
    "qcd corrections to born result are about 3% @xcite . therefore there is no doubt that the heavy quarks produced at the @xmath3 resonance are polarized .",
    "however , this prediction still awaits a firm experimental verification .",
    "unfortunately , these are hadrons rather than quarks which are registered in the detectors and the quantitative theoretical description of the spin transfer during the time development of a heavy quark jet is still lacking .",
    "thus , it is not clear in which way the original high degree of polarization is reflected in the properties of jets containing heavy flavours .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite that non - zero helicities and chiralities of heavy quarks may result in non - zero values of two - particle momentum correlations for the most energetic particles in jets : @xmath260 where for @xmath261 only particles of opposite electric charges are considered . however , in @xcite a negative result has been recently reported of the search for the asymmetries in distributions of @xmath262 and @xmath261 no definite conclusion follows from this finding because no detailed theory exist relating these corelation functions with the primordial polarizations of the heavy quarks",
    ".    it seems more interesting to look for some signatures of the primordial polarization in those processes for which theoretical description is more reliable .",
    "semileptonic decays of heavy flavors belong to this cathegory .",
    "recently there has been considerable progress in the theory of the inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons@xcite . in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and",
    "@xmath263 expansion it has been shown that in the leading order the lepton spectra for the decays of hadrons coincide with those for the decays of free heavy quarks @xcite . away from the endpoint region",
    "there are no @xmath264 corrections to this result @xcite and @xmath265 corrections have been calculated in @xcite for @xmath266 mesons and in @xcite for polarized @xmath267 and @xmath268 baryons .",
    "for some decays the results are similar to those of the well - known accmm model @xcite .",
    "the corrections to charm decays are larger than for bottom and convergence of @xmath263 expansion is poorer @xcite . in @xcite order @xmath28",
    "perturbative qcd corrections have been calculated to the angular and energy distributions of leptons in semileptonic decays of polarized charm and bottom quarks .",
    "thus a complete theoretical description exists of the inclusive lepton spectra which should be accurate up to the level of few percent .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out @xcite that for semileptonic chanels not only the charged leptons but also the neutrinos can be registered as a missing energy - momentum . in consequence",
    "the sensitivity to the primordial polarization can be increased and simultaneously ambiguities in the process of jet fragmentation can be significantly reduced@xcite .",
    "the real drawback is that due to hadronization the net longitudinal polarization of the decaying @xmath2 and @xmath7 quarks is drastically decreased .",
    "in particular these @xmath2 quarks become depolarized which are bound in @xmath266 mesons both produced directly and from @xmath269 transitions and @xmath270 mesons from fragmentations of polarized @xmath2 and @xmath7 quarks retain some information on the primordial polarization .",
    "it is plausible that a quark with helicity -1/2 fragments into a state of helicity -1 more frequently than into that of helicity + 1 . in electromagnetic transitions ,",
    "however this information is lost unless the polarization of real or virtual @xmath167 is measured .",
    "@xmath271 transitions might be more useful in this respect . ] .",
    "the signal is therefore significantly reduced . only those @xmath2",
    "s ( a few percent ) which fragment directly into @xmath267 baryons retain information on the original polarization @xcite .",
    "polarization transfer from a heavy quark @xmath203 to the corresponding @xmath272 baryon is 100% @xcite at least in the limit @xmath273 .",
    "thus , a large net polarization is expected for heavy quarks in samples enriched with heavy @xmath267 and @xmath268 baryons .",
    "since semileptonic decays are under control it is possible to measure these polarizations .",
    "many new opportunities arise , polarization studies for other decay chanels among them .",
    "one of the most interesting may be studies of non - perturbative effects in fragmentation of bottom and charm quarks .",
    "comparison of polarizations for @xmath267 and @xmath268 baryons can be instrumental in studying non - perturbative corrections to the spin transfer in fragmentation .",
    "this will be possible only if experimentalists can separate directly produced baryons from those from resonances . assuming that this is possible and anticipating further progress in hqet as well as in perturbative qcd calculations one may expect that polarization studies for @xmath2 systems at lep will offer new opportunities to test the standard model .",
    "recently , the aleph collaboration reported a preliminary result on @xmath267 polarization @xmath274 @xcite .",
    "this result which is well below theoretical expectations indicates that the sample may be contaminated with @xmath267 s from decays of other beautiful baryons .",
    "i would like to dedicate this work to professor kacper zalewski on the occasion on his sixtieth birthday .",
    "many of us owe professor zalewski a great debt for the stimulus and friendship he has given us over many years .",
    "i am particularly indebted to him for a help at a crucial stage in my academic life .",
    "i hope that this meeting has helped in some way to express that gratitude as well as our best wishes for the future .",
