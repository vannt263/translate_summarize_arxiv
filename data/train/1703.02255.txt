    "formal topology @xcite is a predicative presentation of locales , and has been successful in constructivising many results of the classical topology .",
    "however , the relation between formal topology , which is a point - free notion , and other constructive point - set approaches to topology is not as simple as in the classical case .",
    "classically , the adjunction between the category of topological spaces and that of locales provides a fundamental tool which relates locale theory and point - set topology .",
    "although this adjunction has been shown to be constructively valid by aczel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 21 ) , it seems to be of little practical use in bishop constructive mathematics @xcite since we can not obtain useful correspondence between point - set notions and point - free notions through this adjunction .",
    "for example , we can not show that the formal reals and formal cantor space are equivalent to their point - set counterparts without employing fan theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.4 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.3 ) , which is not valid in the recursive realizability interpretation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 , section 7 ) ) . since bishop emphasises the computational aspect of his mathematics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) , it seems that fan theorem is not acceptable in bishop constructive mathematics , the development of which we respect and follow .",
    "moreover , from the topos theoretic point of view @xcite , fan theorem is not desirable as it is not valid in some grothendieck toposes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .    instead , palmgren used vickers s notion of localic completion of generalised metric spaces @xcite to construct another embedding from the category of locally compact metric spaces into that of formal topologies that has more desirable properties , e.g.  preservation of compactness and local compactness , and the order of real valued continuous functions @xcite .",
    "this allows us to transfer results in bishop s theory of metric spaces to formal topologies .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to further strengthen the connection between bishop constructive mathematics and formal topology by generalising the results by vickers and palmgren to the setting of uniform spaces .",
    "the notion of uniform space that we deal with in this paper is a set equipped with a family of generalised metrics on it , where a generalised metric is the notion obtained by dropping the symmetry from that of pseudometric and allowing it to take values in the non - finite upper reals ( definition [ def : genmet ] ) .",
    "this structure will be called a generalised uniform space ( gus ) . when specialised to a family of pseudometrics ( i.e.  finite dedekind symmetric generalised metrics )",
    ", the notion corresponds to that of uniform space treated in the book by bishop ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 , problems 17 ) .",
    "hence , the notion of generalised uniform space provides a natural setting to talk about generalisations of the results by vickers and palmgren at the same time . our first aim is to extend the notion of localic completion of generalised metric spaces by vickers to gus s ( section [ sec : loccomp ] ) .",
    "our second aim is to extend palmgren s results about bishop metric spaces @xcite to bishop uniform spaces by applying the localic completion of gus s ( section [ sec : functemb ] ) .",

    "we now summarise our main results . in section",
    "[ sec : loccomp ] , we define the localic completion of a generalised uniform space , and examine its functorial properties and uniform structure . in particular , we show that the localic completion preserves inhabited countable products of gus s ( theorem [ prop : omegaprod ] ) . for a symmetric gus @xmath0 with a family of generalised metrics @xmath3 , we show that the localic completion of @xmath0 is embedded into the point - free product of the localic completion of each generalised metric in @xmath3 as an overt weakly closed subtopology ( theorem [ thm : closedembedding ] ) .",
    "this is a point - free analogue of the usual point - set completion of @xmath0 .",
    "next , we show that the formal points of the localic completion of @xmath0 gives the standard completion of @xmath0 in terms of cauchy filters ( theorem [ thm : completion ] ) . in section [ sec : functemb ] , we specialise the localic completion to the class of finite dedekind symmetric gus s , and extend palmgren s functorial embedding of locally compact metric spaces to uniform spaces ( theorem [ thm : localicembedding ] ) . here , one of our important contributions is a new characterisation of the cover of the localic completion of a locally compact uniform space ( proposition [ lem : coverlcm ] ) that simplifies the previous characterisation for locally compact metric spaces by palmgren ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.17 ) . in section [ sec : pfcomp ] , we show that the localic completion of a symmetric gus @xmath0 is equivalent to the point - free completion of the uniform formal topology associated with @xmath0 ( theorem [ thm : equivlcomppfucomp ] ) .",

    "<S> a generalised uniform space ( gus ) is a set @xmath0 equipped with a family of generalised metrics on @xmath0 , where a generalised metric on @xmath0 is a map from @xmath1 to the upper reals satisfying zero self - distance law and triangle inequality .    for a symmetric generalised uniform space </S>",
    "<S> , the localic completion lifts its generalised uniform structure to a point - free generalised uniform structure . </S>",
    "<S> this point - free structure induces a complete generalised uniform structure on the set of formal points of the localic completion that gives the standard completion of the original gus with cauchy filters .    </S>",
    "<S> we extend the localic completion to a full and faithful functor from the category of locally compact uniform spaces into that of overt locally compact completely regular formal topologies . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we give an elementary characterisation of the cover of the localic completion of a locally compact uniform space that simplifies the existing characterisation for metric spaces . </S>",
    "<S> these results generalise the corresponding results for metric spaces by erik palmgren .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the localic completion of a symmetric gus is equivalent to the point - free completion of the uniform formal topology associated with the gus .    </S>",
    "<S> we work in aczel s constructive set theory @xmath2 with the regular extension axiom . </S>",
    "<S> some of our results also require countable choice . </S>"
