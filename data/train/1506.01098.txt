    "one of the most important topics in statistical physics is the formation of order .",
    "a classical nonequilibrium example is provided by the one - dimensional ( 1d ) glauber - ising model quenched to a zero temperature .",
    "it approaches one of the ordered ground states by forming larger and larger domains  @xcite , and this coarsening process has been analyzed in full detail ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the relaxation toward equilibrium is very slow : in the absence of an external field , the domain walls perform annihilating random walks and the density accordingly decays as @xmath0 as time @xmath1 goes by  @xcite .",
    "a kinetically constrained version also exhibits glassy behavior with anomalously slower coarsening  @xcite , and such `` aging '' can even cease to proceed under steady driving  @xcite .",
    "one may ask if something similar can be achieved in the original glauber - ising system by driving it with a suitable protocol , as has been pointed out in ref .  .",
    "evidently , a constant external field does not work for that purpose because the field will only accelerate the coarsening dynamics by breaking the up - down symmetry .",
    "if the symmetry is concerned , an alternative protocol would be an oscillating field with a short period .",
    "this is of particular interest from the perspective of interaction of light and matter in the high - frequency regime .",
    "the problem becomes highly nontrivial , especially when the matter has internal spatiotemporal correlations as a many - body system ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) . due to its ubiquity and often dramatic consequences as reported in ref .",
    ", the nonequilibrium caused by oscillatory driving still remains as an active area of research to be explored further  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the 1d ising chain under an oscillating field , one possible scenario is that the system has such a large time scale that it simply overlooks the rapid oscillation so that the field appears as a small perturbation around the ordered state .",
    "indeed , this has been numerically observed in the two - dimensional kinetic ising model subjected to an oscillating field ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . on the other hand",
    ", it also seems plausible that the disordered state can remain stable , although energetically unfavorable , just as an inverted pendulum is stabilized by fast oscillatory driving  @xcite . in this paper , we show that the latter is the case when the field strength is greater than or equal to the spin - spin coupling strength .",
    "in fact , from the dynamic rules defined below , we can readily convince ourselves that all the correlations are completely destroyed if the field amplitude exceeds the spin - spin coupling strength , which effectively corresponds to an infinite temperature .",
    "if the field is weaker than the spin - spin interaction , on the other hand , the up - down symmetry can be broken as in an ordered phase because the system can not escape from the absorbing states with all the spins aligned in one direction .",
    "only when the internal and external energy scales are equally strong , we observe finite nontrivial correlations and a stationary density of domain walls .",
    "we will explain this point by calculating correlation functions and the distribution of domain lengths both analytically and numerically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : an explanation of our model system is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "correlation functions and the domain length distribution are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of results and conclusions .",
    "let us consider a 1d ising chain with size @xmath2 under a time - dependent external field @xmath3 .",
    "the energy function is written as @xmath4 where the spin variable @xmath5 can take either @xmath6 or @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the coupling strength between neighboring spins .",
    "we will impose a periodic boundary condition by setting @xmath9 .",
    "the time evolution of this system is assumed to obey the zero - temperature glauber dynamics  @xcite , which means that every spin flips with the following rate : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy difference due to a spin flip from @xmath5 to @xmath12 .",
    "the external field @xmath3 takes a rectangular pulse shape between @xmath13 and @xmath14 with period @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath17 as a time index within each period .",
    "then , the external field is described as follows : @xmath18 as briefly mentioned above , we need to consider competition between the spin - spin interaction and the external driving : if @xmath19 , the field direction solely determines the dynamics , so that the system is equivalent to a collection of non - interacting spins subjected to the field .",
    "if @xmath20 , on the other hand , the field can not flip a spin once it is surrounded by two other spins in the same direction . as a consequence , the density of domain walls keeps decreasing , regardless of the field direction , playing the role of the lyapunov function in this dynamics .",
    "this means that the steady states under periodic driving must be the ordered ones for @xmath20 , and the deterministic nature of the dynamics suggests that the coarsening will not be slower than the field - free case .",
    "one can indeed numerically check that the density of domain walls decays as @xmath0 when @xmath21 is small but with a smaller prefactor than in the absence of @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason , we can say that @xmath22 is the most nontrivial point due to the interplay between the field and the spin - spin interaction . henceforth , we will set @xmath22 unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "as is well known , the dynamics can also be analyzed in terms of domain walls .",
    "we will briefly review three basic processes of the domain - wall dynamics , i.e. , pair creation , pair annihilation , and propagation , assuming that @xmath23 .",
    "first , two domain walls are created inside a down - spin domain @xmath24 when the field flips the spin in the middle with rate @xmath25 , which results in @xmath26 .",
    "second , the pair - annihilation process is possible in two different ways , i.e. , @xmath27 with rate @xmath28 or @xmath29 with rate @xmath25 .",
    "last , a domain wall propagates when a spin flips at a domain boundary , e.g. , @xmath30 with rate @xmath28 . in the spin language ,",
    "all these processes tend to align spins along the field direction .",
    "therefore , few domain walls exist if the field has been applied for a sufficiently long period",
    ". one of our primary interests is how the density of domain walls varies in time when the time - dependent field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) drives the system .",
    "we can formally describe the glauber - ising dynamics by using the transition - matrix formulation because it is markovian .",
    "the ising chain in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) has @xmath31 microstates .",
    "indexing the microstates by @xmath32 , we define @xmath33 as the probability to find the system in state @xmath34 at time @xmath1 . the probability distribution",
    "can then be denoted as @xmath35 with a constraint for the conservation of total probability , @xmath36 .",
    "one can readily calculate any single - time observable from @xmath37 in principle , including the average domain wall density .",
    "the zero - temperature glauber rates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) define an @xmath38 transition matrix @xmath39 that governs the evolution of @xmath37 in the following way : @xmath40 where @xmath41 means a time scale for flipping a single spin .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that every spin has a chance to flip during one time step on average , which means that @xmath41 should be proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the rates are dependent on the external field , so we can distinguish the rates under @xmath43 from those under @xmath14 .",
    "it implies that we have to work with two transition matrices : @xmath44 which are actually related by a simple coordinate transformation  @xcite .",
    "after one period , therefore , the probability distribution at time @xmath45 evolves to @xmath46 with @xmath47^t [ ( \\mathbf{m}^+)^l]^t$ ] .",
    "when the system has been entrained by the driving , it should be found statistically identical at time @xmath1 and @xmath48 .",
    "this can be regarded as a nonequilibrium steady state in a stroboscopic sense .",
    "for example , we may observe the system at the beginning of every period , i.e. , at @xmath49 and denote the resulting steady state as @xmath50 .",
    "it is obtained by solving the following equation : @xmath51 and the existence of such an eigenvector is guaranteed because both the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 are stochastic .",
    "the steady - state distribution for general @xmath54 is also obtained in a straightforward way . in practice ,",
    "( [ eq : eigen ] ) can be solved only for @xmath55 because the size of @xmath56 grows as an exponential function of @xmath2 . from a computational point of view , it is often more efficient to sample configurations by using a monte carlo method .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc ] demonstrates that the monte carlo sampling precisely reproduces the result from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigen ] ) .",
    "our monte carlo result also shows that the transition - matrix calculation for @xmath57 is quite accurate in estimating the average density of domain walls in a larger system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] ) .",
    "it implies the following : suppose that we randomly take ten consecutive spins in a large system many times and count the frequency of an arbitrary spin configuration @xmath58 .",
    "our observation suggests that it will be more or less similar to @xmath59 obtained from the transition - matrix calculation , and it is supported by monte carlo calculations ( not shown ) .",
    "if a large system can be approximated as a collection of small ones of @xmath60 , it is because the characteristic length scale is shorter than @xmath61 . in other words , this observation suggests weakness of the interaction between domain walls .",
    "this remark will also be supported by other observations below .",
    "another important question in this context is whether a dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) occurs as the half period @xmath21 is varied .",
    "for example , for dimensions higher than one , the glauber - ising model undergoes a symmetry - breaking dpt at a sufficiently low temperature as @xmath21 decreases  @xcite .",
    "such a dpt is explained by the competition between internal and external time scales for relaxation and driving , respectively .",
    "however , such a dpt seems unlikely in our ising chain , although the temperature is zero : one clue in figs .  [ fig : mc ] and [ fig : size ] is that the response to @xmath13 ( @xmath62 ) is indistinguishable from the one to @xmath14  ( @xmath63 ) for any value of @xmath21 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath64 also oscillates around zero with preserving the up - down symmetry for any @xmath21 ( not shown ) .",
    "we will present a more quantitative argument for the absence of a dpt by using correlation functions , which we introduce below .",

    "we begin by considering slow driving , e.g. , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc](d ) .",
    "one can easily understand the behavior of the density of domain walls : at @xmath49 , for example , the field abruptly changes from @xmath14 to @xmath13 , whereas most of the spins are pointing downward .",
    "the density of domain walls thus increases when @xmath54 is small .",
    "as @xmath54 grows further , however , it is followed by a downturn in the density because almost all the spins are aligned in the field direction .",
    "then , the field changes to @xmath14 again , and all the processes of creation and annihilation of domain walls are repeated anew .",
    "we will put this description on a more quantitative ground by considering correlation functions , and then move on to the case of fast driving .",
    "let us recap the time evolution of an individual spin @xmath58 during @xmath41 as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) . in the limit of @xmath73 , the time derivative of magnetization and that of the two - point correlation function can be written as @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , where @xmath76 means the average over configurations .",

    "note that we have assumed invariance under translation and reflection in the correlation functions .",
    "we could also write down the evolution of the three - point correlation functions , but it is already obvious that the equations will not be closed . to proceed",
    ", we need to truncate the endless sequence of equations .",
    "our minimalist description is neglecting correlation over a distance greater than two , so it reads as    [ eq : eqmotion ] @xmath83    where we have included the evolution of @xmath84 , which appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) .",
    "this description is minimalist in the following sense : suppose that @xmath84 is also neglected .",

    "unregulated by higher - order correlations , it has a fixed point at @xmath86 , which is unphysical .",
    "we thus conclude that we need to take into account @xmath84 at least .",

    "( [ eq : eqmotion ] ) , numerically integrated from an initial condition with @xmath89 and @xmath90 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dw](a ) ] .",
    "this agreement is also consistent with the remark in the previous section that the correlation length is not greater than @xmath61 .    .",

    "( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) in an average sense .",
    "this assumption is supported by the following argument : if any remnant magnetization @xmath94 exists , it means that the system is unable to respond to such a rapid field modulation .",
    "according to this idea , @xmath84 would not change appreciably upon the field reversal , either . when @xmath95 , eq .",

    "put differently , the relaxational time scale does not grow longer than the one for driving , and this is consistent with our observation of short correlation lengths . as a side remark , we add that the statement of vanishing @xmath85 contains a subtle point : if @xmath85 was strictly zero all the time , it would imply @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0 ] ) or ( [ eq : negative ] ) , which is self - contradictory .",
    "a correct explanation is rather that @xmath85 will keep changing around zero with a small magnitude .",
    "in addition to @xmath97 in an average sense , the steady - state condition requires that both @xmath99 and @xmath100 must also vanish . solving the set of linear equations resulting from eqs .",

    "this calculation agrees well with our monte carlo result , confirming the existence of domain walls in the presence of a fast switching field [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dw](b ) ] .",
    "so far , we have focused on the lowest - order ones among the infinite hierarchy of correlation functions , and this turns out to be enough to describe certain average quantities , such as the density of domain walls .",
    "now , let us proceed to the detailed statistics of domains to gain more information .",
    "we begin by considering how domains evolve in time when the field is taken to be @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the density of down - spin domains of length @xmath103 so that @xmath104 is equal to the fraction of down spins .",
    "we have four mechanisms that affect @xmath102 .    1 .   a domain of length @xmath103 disappears when any of its down spins flips upward .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , two spins at the boundary flip with rate @xmath28 , whereas the rate is reduced to @xmath25 for the other @xmath105 spins in the bulk . therefore , the total rate of loss amounts to @xmath106 , multiplied by @xmath102 , for @xmath107 .",
    "note that this formula does not cover the case of a single - spin domain , which disappears via @xmath108 with rate @xmath28 .",
    "the density @xmath102 increases when a domain of length @xmath109 shrinks by one at the boundary .",
    "the contribution is counted as @xmath110 because of the two boundary spins .",
    "3 .   we can increase @xmath102 by dividing a domain of length @xmath111 into two pieces in such a way that @xmath112 if @xmath113 , this has two different possibilities , each with rate @xmath25 , so the contribution to @xmath102 from the domain of length @xmath114 is equal to @xmath115 .",
    "even if @xmath116 , the contribution is still @xmath115 because the division creates two domains of length @xmath103 with rate @xmath25 . in total",
    ", this third mechanism contributes @xmath117 to @xmath102 .",
    "4 .   the last mechanism is to merge a domain of size @xmath118 and another with size @xmath119 to create a domain of size @xmath103 .",
    "we can visualize it as @xmath120 to evaluate the probability of this event , we need to know the probability of the configuration on the left - hand side .",
    "the independent - interval approximation ( iia ) suggests that the lengths can be regarded as totally uncorrelated so that the probability can be expressed as @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "the total contribution of this mechanism is thus approximately written as @xmath122 .",
    "gathering all these terms , we arrive at    [ eq : dist ] @xmath123    the next step is to consider the dynamics of up - spin domains with keeping the same field direction .",
    "similar to @xmath102 , we define @xmath124 as the density of up - spin domains of length @xmath103 .",
    "we have five mechanisms to affect @xmath124 .    1 .   in the first mechanism ,",
    "a domain of a single up spin evaporates via @xmath125 with rate @xmath25 .",
    "this takes place only for @xmath126 .",
    "2 .   again",
    ", this second mechanism applies only to @xmath126 .",
    "a domain of length @xmath28 can be created via @xmath127 with rate @xmath25 .",
    "for this to happen , we have to pick up a down spin surrounded by two other down spins .",
    "for a down - spin domain of size @xmath114 , we have @xmath128 such spins .",
    "therefore , we compute this contribution as @xmath129 .",
    "note that the dynamics of @xmath124 is coupled to that of @xmath102 .",
    "the third mechanism describes a loss due to the growth from length @xmath103 .",
    "the domain can grow to the left or right , each with rate @xmath28 , so the contribution becomes @xmath130 .",
    "a domain of length @xmath103 can be gained from the growth process as well , when a domain of length @xmath131 expands to @xmath103 by flipping a spin upward at the boundary with rate @xmath28 .",
    "however , we can not simply write it as @xmath132 because the spin flip may merge this domain with another .",
    "for example , if we look at the left boundary , the following process creates a domain of length @xmath103 : @xmath133 whereas the following does not : @xmath134 in short , it depends on the direction of the spin drawn as a double arrow on the leftmost side . in a similar spirit to the iia , we assume a well - defined probability @xmath135 for the spin to point downward so that the contribution becomes @xmath136",
    "the last mechanism is to merge two up - spin domains , one with size @xmath114 and the other with size @xmath119 as follows : @xmath137 as before , we resort to the iia to estimate the contribution as @xmath138 .    to sum up",
