    "the @xmath0 model is one of typical model systems that have been widely studied in the arena of statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "most existing studies so far have been performed in the regular lattice structures of one  @xcite , two  @xcite , three  @xcite , and four  @xcite dimensions . in particular ,",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0 model has been found to exhibit the famous berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite , and the all - to - all globally - coupled @xmath0 system has been known to exhibit the mean - field ( mf ) type phase transition  @xcite .",
    "also , recent progress in complex network research has made the interplay between connection structure of interacting spins and the nature of phase transition a central topic in statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "differently from most previous studies , we investigate in this paper the one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0 model with variable interaction range and explore how the interaction range affects the collective critical behavior of the model .",
    "the underlying 1d topology of the system allows us to study the _ winding number excitation _ that has been known to exist in the system with local / nonlocal interaction  @xcite .",
    "we propose a novel nonlocal order parameter based on the distribution of the winding number excitation , which is found to successfully exhibit a clear signature of the phase transition .",
    "the present paper consists of five sections .",
    "section  ii introduces the model and in sec .",
    "iii we explore thermodynamic behavior of the model , by measuring the standard quantities such as magnetization , specific heat , susceptibility , and binder s cumulant to detect the phase transition . in sec .",
    "iv , which contains the key part of the present paper , we define the winding number for a given configuration of the phase variables , and investigate the behavior of its distribution depending on the system size and temperature . based on the observation of the winding number distribution function ,",
    "a novel nonlocal order parameter is introduced and used to successfully detect the phase transition .",
    "finally , a brief summary follows in sec .",
    "we study the 1d @xmath0 model of @xmath1 spins described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the phase angle variable of the @xmath6th spin with the periodic boundary condition @xmath7 , and @xmath2 is the interaction range in one side so that each spin interacts with total @xmath8 nearest - neighbor spins in both sides .",
    "we take the ferromagnetic coupling with the positive strength @xmath9 , which makes the neighbor spins favor their phase difference to be minimized .",
    "the typical 1d @xmath0 model with the nearest - neighbor interaction corresponds to the case of @xmath10 , and the globally - coupled @xmath0 model with all - to - all couplings is achieved when @xmath11 , respectively .",

    "we have taken the overdamped regime with the inertia term ( containing @xmath21 ) neglected as in ref .   where a condensed matter system ( smectic liquid - crystal ) has been studied .",

    "we note that the 1d system with short - range interaction does not exhibit any long - range order at finite temperature  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when the dimensionality of the system is higher than the lower critical dimension 2 , the celebrated mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite can not disprove the existence of the long - range order , as typically exemplified in 3d  @xcite , 4d  @xcite , and globally - coupled  @xcite @xmath0 models . in this context",
    ", it is natural to have the following questions : is there a critical interaction range @xmath23 beyond which a finite - temperature phase transition starts to occur ?",
    "if so , does the phase transition always belong to the mf universality class ? to answer these questions , we study the critical behavior of the model , first measuring some standard quantities for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which is presented in next section .",
    "in this section we numerically study the thermodynamic behavior of the system , with particular attention paid to the emergence of the phase transition at finite values of the interaction range @xmath2 .",
