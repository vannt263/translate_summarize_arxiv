    "with their sophisticated structure , multi - agent related consensus problems have attracted significant interest in recent years .",
    "the complex nature and sophisticated framework of multi agent consensus problem serves as a fertile ground for the application of advanced control algorithms , and found basis in many areas including cooperative control , formation control , flocking and rendezvous @xcite .",
    "so far , the consensus methodologies have been widely explored for multi - agent _ linear _ dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "however , most physical systems are nonlinear in their nature or even exhibit the phenomenon of chaos .",
    "the combination of consensus and nonlinear dynamics remains as a major challenge in literature , although some preliminary results have been presented in recent years .",
    "for instance , in the work of @xcite , a new rule was introduced for nonlinear protocol design allowing consensus on a general set of values . in @xcite ,",
    "the investigation was concentrated on nonlinear cooperative control for consensus of nonlinear and heterogeneous systems .",
    "@xcite discussed the problem of consensus for multi - agent systems with inherent nonlinear dynamics under directed topologies , where a variable transformation method is used to convert the consensus problem to a partial stability problem .",
    "@xcite studied the leader - following consensus of nonlinear multi - agent systems without the assumption that the topology is connected or fixed .",
    "on the other hand , receding horizon control based methodologies gained significant momentum in the last two decades which are used to obtain an optimal feedback control law by minimizing the desired performance index for a given finite horizon . in that sense , receding horizon control is one of the powerful methodologies that is adapted to consensus problem of multi - agent dynamics .",
    "based on this approach , there have been many results developed for consensus problems and its applications .",
    "the work of @xcite presented a distributed receding horizon control law for dynamically coupled nonlinear systems based on its linearization representative .",

    "fixed directed / undirected network , the nonlinear consensus problem is converted to an optimization framework and the control protocol is designed locally for each agent by real - time nonlinear receding horizon control algorithm which is an important extension to the existing literature and presents the novelty of proposed nrhc procedure . here",
    ", a non - iterative optimization algorithm is applied to avoid high computational complexity and large data storage . during this process",

    "we also provide asymptotic stability guarantees to achieve consensus within the given topology .",
